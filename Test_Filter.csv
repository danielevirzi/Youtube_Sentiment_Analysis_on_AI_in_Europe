UBI just means you don’t have to work if you don’t want to - not that everybody gets the same amount and nothing else. 🙄  It will be a well thought out and fair system which rewards those that can find jobs and choose to work while at the same time ensuring that nobody has to.  And the UBI “handouts” won’t come out of your tax money - it will be money generated by AI and an automated workforce that everybody shares the benefit of.  (There have already been several pilot programs of UBI systems that have been pretty successful).  You should throw away your dystopian strawman arguments and do a jot of real research into what the experts are suggesting.

Now let's say the issue of power consumption is resolved. Where does it come from? Solar, wind or fossil fuels? I bet it will mostly come from fossil fuels and the environmentalists are going to go nuts over it. Then there's an issue with the amount of hardware required to run AI.

under capitalism, the means of production (the stuff we use to produce other stuff) are privately owned. in the case of robots, the programmers/engineers will need what basically amounts to a computer and robot parts, in order to make a functioning robot that the capitalist wants them to make. the computer and robot parts here are the means of production, which as i said, are privately owned and even the final product will be sold off to a consumer/s not by the individuals that made it, but by the capitalist.

under socialism, yes, the same people with the same specialist knowledge will be accomplishing those same tasks. but the individuals themselves involved in the process of creating the robots will also have full ownership of the things used to make those robots and they will be able to give it to others themselves without the capitalist claiming their creation as their own. hope that helps!",2024-04-08T08:32:37Z

2023-08-15T10:25:59Z,@user-eq7we5hh3d,avqMUyNrkGY,"Well im not that optimistic as you are. 
Because if we want to boost productivity not by hiring but with AI, what will happen ? Since this productivity doesn't lead to higher wages, in fact it can destroy them and employment too, then the demand won't be following either, and this is called deflation. Which could result in prices drop, companies losing revenue, being forced to lay off more, crushed by their own debt, as well as the state's, tax revenue drop, they default, so banks stop lending, etc. its a catastrophy. 

You would have the exact same problem if you just kept the same amount of workers but less human work time on a pc. That means less income, so that means less revenue, less demand, more lay offs so ye its a self eating process... 

And creating 1 job for 50 people isn't gonna be enough too cuz, in the case of Netflix for example, well an AI engineer wont buy 50 of the netflix subscriptions. So Netflix doesn't want to lose popular consumption at all. Quite ironic since they're the ones who would have destroyed it in the first place by replacing with AI. 

The only way for AI to have a positive impact is if it creates more jobs than it destroys. but obviously no one knows for sure and even if it did happen, since jobs destruction happens faster than creation of new ones, the transition would be so hurtfull for workers that it could never be acheived at all because of social tensions like strike, riots, maybe even civil war...

However, I believe in Karma and if the demand really drops because of AI, then it will affect AI too ! Indeed, why would you buy 50 pcs when an AI can make the work of 50 employes ? Mircrosoft, Nvidia etc. revenue will drop because of the Ai they created themselves. Best way to lose your investors XD
And why would you buy a 1000 pc when you can sell AI images just above the cost it took to produce them ? so 10 cents. It's not a bisness idea at all... 
Why would you buy a pc and start an online bisness when 90% of users are AIs ? and unlike humans, AIs dont have credit cards lol. 
Why would you share your infos on the internet if we easily can take them ? 
Whats a digital world purpose if it doesn't guarantee you privacy, safety, intellectual proprety, job, trustfull news and human interaction anymore ?

Even with same employment rate, all this massive drop of demand for digital goods and services could push AI to implose itself and never to be built again. Obviously, i cant predict the future but no one can predict the future ""better"" either.",2023-08-15T10:25:59Z

People don't understand that productivity is a good thing. People always want to achieve more. A society with high unemployement leads to low sales and low wages, which means huge incentive to hire people to improve the quality of your products, services, or marketing, in order to sell more due to low sales.

Also, just becaus it can write code doesn't mean it's advanced enough to write good/maintainable code.
