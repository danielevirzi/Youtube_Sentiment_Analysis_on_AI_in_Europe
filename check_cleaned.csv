45,i simply only trust books
46,flying chair
47,i bet if you ask it for a talking mouse it creates a mickey clone
48,seems like we are blurring the lines on reality and simulated reality i think that s sort of the point if you want to take it that far i could imagine that the future ai augmented reality could create artificial universe simulated exactly like our own and generated endlessly
49,i did nothing
51,it s crazier when you take the fact that it s all exponential growth this is all going way too fast and you can t trust the old people politics and corporate to adapt and do good things for the common people

67,how to use it where to use it
68,as if art degree wasn t useless enough

70,this gives creative people the tools they need to create share their ideas lowering the barrier of entry and saving time just like all other tools ever created by smartphones allow everyone to be a photographer ai allow everyone to be anything they want
71,there it is folks the masonic 33 again
72,dude why have they not trid rendering alien how sick would that be
73,as scary as this is excited to see what sh humanity can come up with
74,this may take away jobs however maybe they can recreate old shows that no longer r on still giving credit to the actors but they don t have to go back on set and recreate a show

80,i already don t like it some phones allow you to change photographs that all the people it are smiling etc some people obviously love that but it s still fake i don t think it should be used such areas and should be restricted to scientific and other forms of research the abuse is too dangerous
81,o

90,someone tell sora to do first person walking inside windows xp wallpaper 2002 era
91,this may kill people s interest any kind of content ai content lack authenticity and soul leading to viewer fatigue simultaneously real people s content may struggle to compete terms of entertainment and creativity

102,trying to stay positive the face of all the mal uses that occur as a history teacher this eventually be amazing to literally bring history to life for the kids
103,
104,yep as predicted well now there won t be much use of humans apart from approving of things as final product to check if ai worked correctly wonder what 3bil working population of the world do few years

113,i ve been indirectly killed by ai
114,ai is going to change the world ai 0 56
115,they banned their own technology from piticans cause they know what they would have done pretty sad that the company is doing that and not our own govmnt
116,imagine ai can make whole movie just with a script that would be amazing
117,this is very possible
118,as a musician i going to utilize this tremendously
119,go ahead you have no limits with this wonderful gift from the minds of the genius
120,grant wisler made a joke about using ai to get away with crime only for that to become a prediction
121,now you know that out of all the centuries you could have been born you were born the one just before the dawn of ai
122,just put copyrights on it and watch open ai go down
123,copyright slap it and enjoy
124,smith ai
125,this is amazing beautiful and creepy human can make everything that imagine can even enable technology to do anything we must be careful with this but we shouldn t stop technological and scientific development it s magnificent
126,we re doomed
127,all ai videos should have a legal requirement to be watermarked to identify if its ai generated or not
128,i swear that chair video uncanny
129,i think that ai could be a huge shock to the system many ways meaning society the economic system culture etc nostalgia for the 2010s is likely about to take off as well
131,like 4 years everything on social media be fake and the social part of social media be gone
132,this is getting out of hand i coming up with a lot of ideas on why this is bad off the top of my head i just think the disadvantages far outweighs the benefits
133,yeah thats true my opinion is that this most likely is not going to be able to be stopped because of how ai grows we are def going to have to prepare
134,strawberry fields nothing is real
135,games could potentially be made purely with ai future and i mean like if you look at a city with your mouse or controller it create a fast responsive video of your perspective looking at a really really realistic city everyone your perspective look real real you d not be able to tell if it s ai or actual video
136,this is the beginning of the end of the world as we know it
137,you can t believe everything you see online has officially become you can t believe anything you see online what a world
138,banning does nothing to prevent criminals that s why they are criminals a don t release it until after te election b don t allow any faces to be generated cartoons are fine blurred unrecognizable faces are fine

176,the chair is moving itself
177,this is cancer
178,can t wait to create the minecraft movie with this before it gets released
179,the problem with these is that the database are skewed full of white people and cisgender references
180,imagine the endless possibilities with this hollywood is trouble people are gonna make video games into movies books comics anime existing movies get prequels and sequels scripts that never got used hollywood people use them and create interesting things
181,would like to see this openly and freely accessible just like the bing image creator
182,i m gonna be honest this is actually scary
183,this sends chills down my spine
184,oh thats not
185,i fear if this gets too easy to the points where goons can use it it be mis used foe criminal purposes now amber heard and her ilk can generate videos of depp abusing her and present it as proof
186,once again the money the hands of the american big techs making us poorer and dumber than before
187,gonna ask it to make a video of silksong
188,awesome content by wsj news very educative and following the tips help you a great deal i have related content on my channel coding graphic design and everything ai if this sounds like something you re interested pass by
189,rip hollywood
190,a way it s actually great we never had videos at all until just 150 years ago or the influential videos have on us and digital information general is too high now with this the wild we need other ways to communicate
191,this is terrifying
193,imagine the only ones that have access to this technology are mega corporations and the news media
194,i feel sick watching this
196,this is terrifying
197,it a good run people there goes my job
198,at 0 52 i like that one better because that whole thing is trippy lol
199,please delete the ai it is the beginning of a dark time
200,read industrial society and its future by ted kaczynsky
201,its easy to spot always look at the hands there what nightmares are made of lol ha
202,the matrix
203,you know all well that people use this as shitpost
204,let s hope the era of profiting from these mindless tiktok or similar videos comes to a close perhaps our struggle to distinguish reality from fiction genuine face to face human connections once again take center stage
205,when andrew yang spoke about ubi and wide spread automation why wasn t anyone listening
206,basically can it do you know rumpy a pumperoona
207,all fun games until you realize that ai is destroying artists destroying the movie industry and destroying animators
208,they can keep doing what they like doing this is the nature of technology progression is inevitable
209,snaxfax6820 they cant keep doing things if they dont make money they instead need to switch jobs and it prb end up ending there love for what there doing
210,this is really impressive however nothing would ever beat the complexity of enlightened human soul what we can imagine how we communicate and where we can travel by our souls this is beyond ai reach
211,wrong what we imagine is directly proportional to what data you have your brain secondly soul is fictional
212,this combination is perfect apple vision pro similar or improved a i creation of a world time dilation a i itself that makes you a virtual world and that every second real life is a year this world virtual and that only 1 second passes physically for us eternal life
213,are you trying to become a robot or something
214,why do we feel the need to create something that can do exactly what humans can but just worse not only does it have the possibility of stealing jobs but if used a bad manner can cause real harm to people other ways too for example pornography which people already make of totally random people using ai generated images
215,all of a sudden black mirror lore doesn t seem as far fetched anymore
216,looks good
217,even tho this looks really good it just feels off like there s no proper death perception it just looks like there s no depth to this videos
218,this is simply not okay
219,hollywood with chat gtp we no longer need writers deepfake no longer needs actors and midjourney we no longer needs publicists ha ha with sora we no longer need filmmakers nor studios hollywood no no wait let s talk this out
220,cant wait till we just revert to being farmers
221,those arent even the most realistic ones from their website
222,perhaps we get a chance to see jerusalem during the time of king solomon
223,try egypt pyramid
224,this is inasane
225,legit scared guys we cant distinguish between what is real and what is fake
226,geenie is out of the lamp
227,artists were already dead they are just killing more hobbies
228,reality be more blurry
230,type your prompt down here
231,and none can be used without giving viewers a hradache
232,contradiction of capitalism 101 if your innovations lead to massive layoffs then whose going to be able to buy your products especially unregulated market like america lets imagine that this wipes out untold jobs along with automation other industries alongside supressing wages good luck selling anything
233,these videos are like dreams everything looks realistic and makes complete sense until you look closer and analyze it
234,fr
235,i thinking the same especially the chair the sand scene it looks like how my dreams transition from scene to scene
236,well it is still development we are still doomed
237,thats basically what your looking at the subconsciousness of a neural network images thoughts observations of the inner workings of a mind things popping and out of observable existence from its prospective
238,vedametatronthe human brain is nothing like that
239,this is just the beginning what we have seen from ai is just the first grains of a coming mountain
240,victor dt1uqit both fascinates me scares me
241,too late folks
242,do not release this without regulation
243,do not release this
244,feb 18 2024
245,the destruction of the internet as we know know it
246,33 eh hidden plane sight now i know for sure this stuff be used specifically to destroy us
247,ai ai
248,maybe they should really make it hard to generate prompts by limiting celebrity names political figures promiscuous terms and similar themes to prevent misuse i m sure there be workarounds but i d think updates help to fix problems that s the best i can think of maybe watermarks would help
249,all tech like this eventually be emulated it s only a matter of time before its used that way pandora s box
250,after coyote vs acme getting fked over by hollywood i d predict we ll just make our own movies the future leaving hollywood obsolete
251,i m scared
252,the future is here soraai
253,there were time when cgi but now this ai beast sora taking over entire humanity to next euphoria
254,all the swifties want it shut down
255,where tf did taylor swift come from
256,ms has banned sora s use for political campaign purposes to do would be considered very naughty that s a relief
257,why number 33 hind helmet
258,officer i didn t shoot and kill those two children it s ai generated
259,before only the chosen ones could bring great film projects to life hollywood and its ivory towers dictated the rules but now with sora everyone has access from a student s room to a dreamer s cafeteria everyone can create poverty and lack of support are no longer barriers
260,combine this with the dead internet this is the end of the information era
261,no person use this for good
262,
263,sora make a video of abraham lincoln eating a taco
264,we all know where this is going
265,
266,bro no way
267,ai
268,this isn t a good idea
269,the new wave of artists are now the people that come up with the best ideas prompts
270,another step closer to the dystopian future
271,slasher movies be super realistic soon
272,mind blown cannot wait to play next gen ai games
273,but did it do all the news
274,much power at their fingertips and they re using it to make the most boring stock footage imaginable
275,it s over
277,ai has already effectively replaced concept artists it s a fantastic tool for indie developers that regard can by used by independent filmmakers for storyboarding and visual aid for shot conceptualization composition etc
278,seamusthatsthedog4819 oh i guess that s another good use of ai as long as it doesn t completely replace human creativity
280,leirbag798 humans still have to use the ai if i tell it to generate a video of joe biden boxing donald trump it s still being directed by humans
282,it s about to go down
283,if you watched the tv episode devs you notice its getting awfully close to it eventually we wont be able to discern weather we are looking a computer generated simulation or actual reality from another multiverse
284,me 3 years court watching a hyper realistic video of me committing a crime i never did
285,false accusers gonna have a thrill for this
286,reminds me of start trek tng the simulation room
287,well this work out just fine
288,this be the most deadly weapon 10 years later just imagine someone made about a guy bomb embassy by just using ai generated video could lead to nuclear i just saying if this ai thing gose viral the world change and never be the same
289,rip film industry
290,rip humanity
291,i dont understand why everyone is scared of ai videos like if someone makes a ideo about you making a some kind of a crime watermarks exist and rules
292,this can easily get the wrong hands
293,allin1xavi283 wdym by that
294,ah yes made horrors beyond comprehension
295,yes i shivering my timbers
296,which ai this is
297,who asked for this
298,this needs to be banned many things can go wrong
299,too late for that
300,imagine getting prison for 50 years because someone has faked a video of you using ai
301,this has to stop
302,yes but can it do text to movie with storyline and voice
303,this scares me guys
304,rip shutterstock
305,jaw dropping
306,a lot of people just lost their dreams of becoming animator or cgi expert
307,the same could be said about any job ai come for all jobs the coming years
308,your dreams
309,fitybux4664 not really artists influencers and all major corporate owners and top employees still remain
310,advancedsoul1511 he said a lot of people learn to f read
311,fitybux4664nah ai never be able to compete with human ingenuity
312,you clearly don t understand what being artist means
313,without some radical social political change we are doomed
314,laws have never stopped anything
315,therealtorg i m taking about a deep change how we produce and distribute product and services not just laws regulations
316,ban this asap
317,great now we won t even know if travel videos are actually of real places
318,mappa animators finally get some rest
319,oh my intrusive thoughts
320,of all the areas to make ourselves obsolete and superfluous we choose culture and art absolutely tragic
321,it s scary
322,sora word art online anime go go go
323,oh nah this isn t right
324,0 50 i liked when the chair started to ascend into 4d
325,now imagination become true
326,how do you not see how this poses existential threat to civilisation and probably humanity as a whole this is a single years progression don t ever say you weren t warned
327,its image generation ai not terminator
328,yeah i only believe something i see with my eyes irl from now on
329,how about we make propagandas defamations and slanders with this wow dark isn t it
330,claim your here before it destroys the world ticket here
331,unironically what good could come out of this other than misinformation the company banning the technology from political campaigns wont do literally anything the films that ll come out of this be utterly soulless and i dont know how more people arent realizing that
332,entertainment industry
333,welcome to the end
334,the chair video is what it feels like to do ketamine
336,some theorize this is just the basic level tech they re showing us and what they have secret is light years more advanced it s extremely naive to believe they ll reveal their best
337,if every al generated image s were identified as such it d be a start but that won t happen
338,i have a feeling that hollywood is extremely threatened by this imagine giving this thing a script and letting it direct
339,hollywood s scripts are probably already written by ai
340,they won t be cuz people still loves to watch artist real persons many are fans not just for art but for artist persona probably real treat is for anime graphic creators
341,company acknowledges the technology s potential harm for political reasons company continues to develop said technology instead of abiding by the consensus of a world wide halt on ai development the world is f ed
342,yeah we defiantly aren t prepared for ai i feel like soon our world is going to change faster than we think theory it can be good i just worry it be misused
343,it s over
344,alright i m cooked
345,75 of new content be ai generated by 2025
346,it be a near 100 2030s
347,we re doomed
348,it has banned the use of its technology for political campaigning ok but important question what about porn
349,a sense there could be a way to program a future prediction algorithm down to the atoms by using a lot of what ifs
350,ai needs to completely banned to many liar s and control freak s use it to destroy our world
351,artists sweating bricks and deciding this is immoral and never shouldn t ever replace real art crazy i don t remember the art industry being up arms during the 70 s 80 s when factory workers were losing jobs every day to robotics and automation
352,no but the factory workers were crying about losing their jobs your reasoning is a weird strech and makes no sense and yes it s immoral
355,what is real how do you define real if you re talking about what you can feel what you can smell what you can taste and see then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain
356,we are living a simulation
357,great
358,the magnitude of this impact on society could be devastating
359,the ai generated images and videos are dangerous to the brain specially to children because it does harm to the cognitive development this is really dangerous and need proper scientific study and legislation if you have access to researches psychologists neurologists or legislators please help make people aware of this danger
360,u mean it further destroy trust everything yep exactly that
362,the rise of the machines be much worse than the f g terminator
363,greenskull1093 just imagine what evil people are capable to do with that technology if every image could be fake every voice duplicated every video created just by a mere input of data and some words what can you trust what you did not witness person by yourself
364,this technology be extensively used for propaganda purposes all it takes is one video for a government and its media to ruin someone s reputation to start a even if a tree falls when nobody s around does it make noise who verify the truth
365,somewhereinthesolarsystem lol what don t be silly it s dangerous because people soon be able to fake video evidence we no longer be able to trust anything we see this is why this scares me
366,it already is
367,imagine when israel gets their hands on this
368,we are all doomed and i love it
369,somewhereinthesolarsystemdangerous to the brain
370,somewhereinthesolarsystem what about it causes harm to cognitive development
372,humans haven t evolved enough to use such technology responsibly
373,amazing
374,somewhereinthesolarsystempeople are already altering images and videos highly believable ways even before ai this changes nothing lol
375,hoangkienvu7572 the ai generated images are completely different from anything made before they have lots of unnatural and subliminal movements and noise like people or objects moving impossible ways and interframe objects and positioning you need to have a little knowledge on the subject to understand this is a serious issue
377,hoangkienvu7572 i never said it is easy to find out and most people already can t perceive but the issue is mostly subliminal it is involuntary and affects everyone but children are at risk there are several concepts that you don t know do not call people names this is a serious issue inform yourself and alert others
378,i never said it is easy to find out and most people already can t perceive but the issue is mostly subliminal it is involuntary and affects everyone but children are at risk there are several concepts that you don t know do not call people names this is a serious issue inform yourself and alert others
379,somewhereinthesolarsystemi don t get it what s the issue called i can look into it on google i m curious
380,be devastating
381,somewhereinthesolarsystemi mean what about television movies reality tv you could make this argument for anything
382,and yet entertainment of the future be astounding i can only imagine imagine telling ai to let you play whatever you want like literally describe to ai what you want to play as a video game and it becomes the game you play
383,and it could be life saving you decide how we use it
384,this is some top notch content i read a book with a similar topic and it absolutely incredible game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness by jack frostwell
385,i want to make a whole movie with this ai
386,i don t think i can come up with even a single positive that this technology brings with it
387,people can easily make films and stock footage and it male indie film making much easier
388,gonna make videos of my dungeon and dragon adventures and bring them to life
389,dillonblair6491 aren t movies supposed to be art if you just type a bunch of prompts to make a computer make the whole movie for you then what is even the point
390,blazekee2123 that does sound like a fair positive i hope you have fun with that
391,though this hardly needs saying the boundary between reality and fiction no longer exists which essence means that humans no longer matter
392,why 33 though
393,scene change at 33 seconds and 33 on helmet dual 33
394,don t just sit there do something now
395,it s mostly fun now but horrible things come out of this people use it for ill intent if you thought deepfake bad this be 100x worse
396,we re screwed
397,how this can help whis flower arctic
398,long way away from capturing i guess life likeneas
399,the speed of ai evolution is crazy q couple months after the ai creation video trash and now this
400,humans are doomed reality no longer exists but nobody seems to care
401,
403,yall better start learning how to develop film
404,pixar is probably laying people off after this
405,what if spider from dc
406,we re cooked
407,were not cooked you re incredibly pessimistic
408,bera580 you re incredibly optimistic if you think that this won t be abused into oblivion
409,officialstoicwisdom you re incredibly pessimistic if you think that this won t be regulated into oblivion
410,verlax8956 people find workarounds ai is already being abused but now it be video form it is a cause for concern
411,verlax8956you re incredibly optimistic that this won t affect the workforce creating a new surge of unemployment rates
412,no i want a video with vladimir putin his kremlin office saying i ai construction vote t ump
413,finally i can watch all of those novels i love
414,soros loves sora
415,shut it down
416,i m done
417,tell ai to generate some employments and little bit of cash for me
418,basically a few years everyone the movie industry gonna be out of jobs movie studios only need writers to create scripts to feed the ai
419,ai can write the sript itself too buddy
420,there no longer be a movie industry it ll just be ai independent from any human intervention
421,all fun games until someone s court and they show ai generated video of them committing a crime they never did edit why did this comment get 93 likes it s stupid
422,you saw this meme on twitter did i
423,npjglobalyes i did that s cool
424,elkayemacasilso now video evidence might be admissable you can t use it to convict innocent person but on the downside you can t use it to convict a guilty person
425,fun games
426,the defendant can simply point out that it s ai generated because it lacks a paper trail
427,drunkaoyeah that s too bad i guess
429,you can see it the metadata if it made with ai or actual video recorder
430,why not get rich by using this oh nvm u can t think that way
431,well don t look now it s almost at 300
432,drunkao cgi has existed for years though
433,there be ai experts to get whether it s fake or maybe openai can have a secret code every video which could be used to detect whether it s fake or real
434,terrycullen3302lmao thanks though
435,or goverments using this to create excuses for crimes corruption etc
436,brayg 97 imagine ww3 because of ai video
437,nn sp9tuironically ai is creating more job for people lol
438,hoangkienvu7572 it s probably destroying more jobs than it creates imo
439,nn sp9tu we ll see i guess as of today the only pieces of media i see using ai art are mobile games nobody plays or art you view for free on the internet things like games comic and movies are still very much human made
440,hoangkienvu7572 it s a matter of a few years a lot of freelance work is already drying up
441,drunkaoso i can walk naked on street and when they take a pic i say its ai
442,least braindead anti ai propaganda openai backs up any prompt and output their ais make
443,this is equally incredible and terrifying at the same time due to the countless implications of this tech almost like looking at footage from alternate universes and realities
444,i literally can t think of single good thing that come from this
445,one good thing is you can basically travel back time with this tech with the realism it has like if you were actually there
446,tauceti8060 machine learning is limited by existing datasets that isn t really possible
447,it just consume any new creations as soon as they are out and expand
448,tauceti8060 you confused between artificial and reality
449,just ask sora to generate a video explaining what good things can arise from this
450,tauceti8060 no it s still fake it is a toy there is no value to this past entertainment and manipulation
451,holodecks like star trek
452,djryken why is that good
453,normietwiceremoved cause it would make life space or other planets tolerable for one but mainly you can experience any fantasy you want without wearing equipment
454,more movies that aren t marvel hollywood slop
455,one of good things i could think of is you can make fake footage from ww2 or something for those alt history videos but that means you might be able to make fake footage from modern wars like ukraine or israel
456,indy mapping edits or fake footage from ww2
457,indy mapping editsthats not really a good thing you could fake historical events that never happened which could be bad
458,djryken holodeck i think you mean pornadeck
459,money for them
460,one good thing is that you can write a script for a movie and get it made without being limited by not having enough money and possibly make millions thats one good thing lol
461,your problem
462,you can ask ai for a video of a gorrila vs mike tyson
463,create any movie video game or animation you want with prompt infinite entertainment of exactly what you want
464,cyork sy1wr 0 seconds ago i don t think you understand you ll be able to create whatever movie you want whatever you re fantasy film is you can make it lord of the rings starring mel gibson and russel crow directed by steven spielberg and eventually you ll be able to add yourself into the movie as a character this is only the beginning
466,everyone can make films everyone be artist
467,it s like art it s not necessarily but they do it anyway because why not
468,how about living on mars without internet access and being able to generate your own endless entertainment
469,what why going back tauceti8060
470,you can ask sora to make animation of the current chapter of one piece manga and it do a much better job than the animation studio
471,can t wait to see gpt5
473,it s questioning whether this idea of sora is innovative or not it s just attempt to replace and death sentence for creative arts with technology the future technology i wish something out of what happens on our screen
474,imagine making a multimillion dollar looking film alone over a weekend this is becoming scary good
475,and alone your basement using just a few words
476,you can technically do that now with a cell phone and unreal engine 5 and people are but no one watches because movie stars draw audiences
477,badpuppy3 well now we have ai movie stars
478,imagine now even you can be a movie star
479,they certainly used to but the very notion of a movie stars has faded pretty dramatically my lifetime i d not lay to much hope on that saving the traditional movie industry against this onslaught
480,the video game industry is valued more than twice than the movie industry and we have plenty of non movie stars we dont need overpaid actors
481,my friends did back the days they shot it a rent apartment and ai wasn t even there yet movie is called star wreck 2005 and 4 million people saw it budget just 15 000 you can watch it on youtube english subtitles
482,badpuppy3 wait until you can down load those star images and voices can already licenses james earl jones i beleive
483,not lately with their woke bs been watching more unknown actors and movies
484,i want to it s my dream
485,just scanning the text of some book xd
486,badpuppy3 i mean anime characters are stars their own right and they aren t even plausibly real some of the time
487,it s gone too far now please shut it down seriously
488,get over it
489,cry more
490,imagine making a star wars sequel that doesn t suck or the nicolas cage superman movie with a few strokes of a keyboard
491,what the cell phone has done to social circles ai do the same to imagination
492,say hello to sora openai s game changing text to video marvel https www youtube com shorts ntnqeyuuk7w
493,sora is not yet released to the public is that correct
494,yes
495,yes
496,dang dis is realistic
497,all the warnings are being ignored skynet is coming sooner and sooner near you
498,you better believe they ve already geared up to do exactly what s described on the text of this video 1 16 take that to the bank scary
499,that s why the world doesn t improve instead of thinking about the thousands of good possibilities people only think about the negative possibilities
500,i looking for a glitch the matrix just to help calm my mind if you see this horse disappearing at 0 07 at mid left the screen
501,it should be has generic version that available for low income people
502,nice job people from now on i wont believe any video unless i see it myself
503,me getting arrested for a crime i never commit
504,incredible technology now every creative person have the chance to create quality art
505,lol this kills true creativity and empower the lazy
506,everything can be used for good and bad if it is used by bad people it erase the line between the real and the fake
507,goodbye history hello whatever the current government wants you to believe history
508,ah sweet made horrors beyond my comprehension
509,sora needs their generated videos covered watermarks before it s too late
510,there probably be watermarks for the plebs but the cia version of the software won t have them and it won t have glitches either
511,woooooordddddddddddd davidbrown hn9cv
512,thanks i hate it
513,everyone this product is its infant stage and it is like that already 2 3 5 years it displace 10s of millions of jobs content creators etc
514,merge it with neuralink augmented reality virtual reality sora be real life genjutsu mugen tsukuyomi
515,this is midkey terrifying ai images were one thing but videos this isn t gonna be good
516,this technology only has downsides and a future where entertainment is all ai generated is really depressing
517,this only happen a capitalist dystopia
518,it only has downsides if you benefited from the high barrier to entry for everyone else it makes entertainment creation easy enough for them to enter and make content
519,dillonblair6491the bar for that is literally on the floor people are just lazy this no different to typing horror on netflix and watching what comes up
520,chizknowsdabizyeet7609 i m sorry did you build your device by hand or did you get one made by automation because it s easier for you you can say it s lazy but doing more labor for equal output is called inefficiency
522,i don t think this benefit humanity tbh
523,it only benefits the greedy
524,ok we need social media contents video laws and regulations now
525,regulations can t close pandora s box it s too late
526,w0 x 0w why are you putting capitalism this conversation though
527,yeah give politicians more power and money they can control and ruin things they dont fking understand
528,just ban social media
529,get a real job
530,leirbag798because we live capitalism world
531,overkill845 that alone doesn t serve as explanation
532,no
533,w0 x 0wcapitalism socialism
534,why no one did anything for the blacksmiths glass blowers toy makers farmers and we are still up and running we need laws for the health of the people and the planet not for jobs
535,no we dont
536,azul547 if you have lot s of money if not no
537,pecoraspec yes we see this sovietic union venezuela cuba and north corea
538,c i china the politicians didn t failed to act
539,i favor freedom of speech you are scared of the unknown and react by calls for authoritarian measures and censorship
540,ed19601 judging by your name and allegiance you are ai and should not be taken seriously
541,crakshak sure dude coz i have a number my name i guess half of youtube users are ai bots then for years already including the op you shouldn t worry too much about artificial intelligence worry about your own intelligence
542,leirbag6367 because the entire point of capitalism is to undercut the other guy this technology ruin innocent lives and destroy business the first to use it win whether they shouldn t not don t get me wrong i think this is great if used properly but the wrong hands it s very bad
543,neo luddism a nutshell
544,cry about it
545,this tech should just be kept classified the us government
546,the handyman episode of southpark is becoming a reality sooner than you think lol
547,we re done folks
548,yeah i had fun living but it s a wrap
549,i m just starting with this no more 50 000 cameras etc filmmaker
550,say goodbye to your profession future photographer would probably only approve the photo s as ai can never be perfect doing that there always be a bug or something
551,slo mo bye bye song plays
552,ever heard of dead internet theory
553,
554,it noy eeal renzoharstyle1993
555,crazy how humans made another world of artificial intelligence which is scary to think about like they can turn at us at any time when is giving their mindset and they develop feeling and touch i may be crazy guys
557,geomeridium yeah hopefully it s probably going to take many many many decades even centuries but i watch to many movies i think it s definitely not possible now nor the future
559,how much energy is needed to make a one min video like this if everyone did this perhaps a good chunk of energy consumption would just be this
560,really today it doesn t matter renewable energy has developed hugely too
561,matrix
562,as a history buff and gold prospector the gold rush video is incredible to watch only problem is this isn t true ai it s just a search engine that is following commands given to it by a user and it accesses everything humanity has uploaded to the internet no autonomy whatsoever
563,looks pretty artificially intelligent to me
564,that drone footage of california during the gold rush it incredible its like sending a drone back time and watching the footage
565,but if you watch closely there are some horses that lack one pair of their four legs it looks unnerving they look like aliens
566,salvadoran uwu can be fixed with video inpainting just like image inpainting for dalle
567,incredibile
568,imagine high school history classes instead of showing documentaries from the 80 90s
569,the new age of information warfare is here just imagine how easily the public can be decieved with this to think that the powers at be wouldn t use this for propaganda and against you would foolish
570,whe can make text to video but wsj still asking me to read videos
571,i think that job has already been automated xd
572,the company said it is aware of sora s potential for creating misinformation ahead of the 2024 u s presidential election but we re gonna go ahead and release it anyway
574,its banned for political purposes don t worry
575,it s not available to the public and probably won t be until after the election
576,tauceti8060 like that s going to stop anyone
577,pretty sure the ai looks at the prompt
578,the fact it exists allows for the possibility the government has similar technology maybe even years before
579,they gonna make joe biden some sort of hercules or something
580,they didn t release it though
581,i think the misinformation ship set sail a long time ago
582,tauceti8060lol you can just rephrase sentences
583,tauceti8060pretty sure people willing to spread misinformation wouldn t care much about the tos of ai
584,they just seeing which side takes the bait
585,ok they understand that it might interfere with 2024 election why not release after election
586,someone tell sora to make a video of what would of happened if mark zuckerberg and elon musk actually did fight
587,i feel like this objectively bad and has literally 0 positives all this do is spread misinformation and make hundreds if not thousands of people lose their jobs but what do i know
588,thats y ancestors told us to become sculptor
589,what can go wrong
590,inly the government can have ai we the people ofc use it to spread disinformation misinformation malicious lies missoginy bullying and on and on and on we cannot trust we decide the truth do not agree your bankaccount is closed
591,when you see these video s getting more and more realistic how can you not see where things are headed not to long from now all the streaming apps like netflix disney paramount etc all train ai on their video data and create a practically unlimited amount of new movies shows animations cartoons anime
592,umm we ll be doing it ourselves dont think there wont be open source models given to the public for free cant be stopped just need good enough hardware to run it
593,and it ll be great tbh
594,that would just be a historical blip as the tech would rapidly advance and decrease cost till you d be just as capable of generating that same content as a billion dollar conglomerate
595,we march further on the path to complete and total human bankruptcy
596,pretty soon all adult videos av be ai videos av
597,trust issues
598,this is cool i firmly believe people want to see content made by real humans however have optimism people
599,that s true people have a lot more fascination other people than non human things but there are still many things i have a hard time being optimistic like not being able to tell what s real or not
600,i m excited for its potential to become a weapon of the future and hopefully even today
601,todays special effects oscar goes to 7 year old john smith from backyard garage productions for flying whales eating flying pigs during the world 3 atomic explosion scene
602,imagine youtube a few years
604,youtube fires creators sorry we don t need to pay you anymore
605,i signed up almost 17 years ago look at it now lol
606,could be misused but look what the media does anyway night well just be able to make what ever and put a watermark on the corner and everyone s happy no trickery imagine the movies people could make who can t afford or figure out how to produce something just got good ideas
607,you can bet hollywood lobby congress over this
608,what about zooming a bit to hide the watermark not a solution if you can t figure out it s not for you
609,what s the point of this the disadvantages and dangers seem to far outweigh any potential positives
610,fun fact sora icelandic is used like etta t marit var uppfullt af sora that magazine full of filthy material as maybe they looking far ahead as to have plans to sell this technology to the porn industry lol
612,onlyfans just got obsolete
613,and the people bowed down to the neon god they made
614,suddenly simon and garfunkel
615,tranceporter7426 and the book of exodus
616,nice comment from somebody on the internet watching on their mobile device
617,and the sign flashed out its warning
618,nope i would rather have ai smith eating spaghetti pasta thank you
619,fascinating but indeed extremely dangerous and they know it near future we all have even more scruples to believe what we see on visual medias
620,both fascinating and scary
621,is that 3kliksphillip the thumbnail p
623,non human intelligence tech for example from crash retrievals
624,these are some temporally stable generated imageries
625,opening scene is the catalyst for the real westworld
626,my goddd
627,as aspiring film maker i don t like this at all
628,i m against this as a filmmaker
629,i m for this as a filmmaker
630,there goes your ego hahahahahahhaahahahahahha
631,honeybadgerjay1724 it s coming for yours
632,honeybadgerjay1724 what are babbling about its more like his job then his ego
633,rip shutterstock
634,that s the word i ever expected
635,rip my entire stock footage portfolio
636,zegeebwahwhy do you have a stock photo portfolio just steal pics like everybody
637,logikius they make the stock footage
638,fk shutterstock rip shutterstock photgraphers videographers artists
639,about time we had access to renewable resources thru ai
640,rip 3d artists
641,and good riddance
642,zegeebwahpeople still buy your stock if it looks nice
643,not me livelovely4681
644,they have a deal with them yes
645,rip movies
646,you ask ai to create footage from a town california during the gold rush and it makes it by recording it from the air years before the plane invented
647,yes
648,what do you expect a book
649,i mean that s pretty standard for hollywood s omnipotent omniscient omnipresent camera
650,humans may not apply for jobs anymore
651,incoming a new wave of unemployment
652,soon the lines between real and fake be blurred
653,they ve been blurred for the last ten years lol
654,shut down the screen and live life that be the solution
655,taffem9084this understands
656,if you think life is blurred then you haven t felt the amazing touch of a women or the smell of her hair the stink of her breath the morning you got some reaal issues my girlfriend is incredible her flesh is just unique only rivaled perhaps by another human and never pixels or a robot
657,gabrielrodriguez9142 the stink of her breath the morning
658,not really lol
659,416pp are you not aware that the elite of this world the ones who really call the shots are setting out to delude us into trapping ourselves into a matrix like world where you long to be the virtual world rather than the digital it s coming mate don t know where your head s at that you re scoffing it off
660,taskicorei think he means morning breath
661,youraveragecottonpicker49 i know i just thought it funny how he singled that out
662,soon lol
663,gabrielrodriguez9142the breath thing kind of makes it seem like a bad deal
664,wtf gabrielrodriguez9142 did you just lost your virginity and telling the experience
665,they ve been blurred for years already many idiots online fall for poorly photoshopped photos and that long before ai
666,it s been happening for a long time now i m sure they had this technology 20 years ago or more some videos showing planes hitting the tower look off to me something never sat right about it and now it s making sense
667,they have been blurred for centuries and continue to be that how we ve evolved if you don t know real from fake then i don t know what to tell you
668,i have never heard a descriptive romantic yet pungent with honesty lol gabrielrodriguez9142
670,i think you have no idea what you are talking about do better research
672,0 54 scp has breached containment
673,the old west output is good but the buildings have many flaws the model needs to be taught how interior design should match exterior design the model is showing more a tone than what actual west village would look like i currently train ai and understand a bit of it s current limitations
674,i think the issue is that this is the worst it be going forward
675,it s only gonna get better from here this is just the beginning see what plays out 10 years from now and come back to this
676,it unlock a ton of options we haven t even imagined yet and that s with version 1 of sora what sora 2 or 5 or 10 looks like surely completely revolutionize the way everything is done it s exciting and scary and fascinating and absolutely mind blowing to imagine this future
677,hal 9000 is coming
678,if it s sticky it could be the most incredible technology the world but if it doesn t stick if people don t adopt it it won t go past being a cool tool all the social medias today could have ended up at the bottom page of the app store s if no one bought it to it
679,look back like 3 4 years ago and ai coudnt even made proper cat image and now look at this cant imagine what be next 5 years
680,as artist i feel this technology as a possible threat to creativity and imagination of any artist any user could create imagery through a sort of menu on the other hand as a picture enthusiast this videos like the one of gold rush may be great for scientific and educational porpuses
681,what kind of threat
683,ai is not doing the prompting its only helping people be creative not limiting it you dont have to spend decades learning how to manually recreate the ideas you have your mind you can just write the prompt for it the script and let the ai do the manual labor
684,yrzi you don t seem to be artist it s about the process and not the final work
685,whats the point if its about the process nobody is stopping you from doing art but if you want the final result you can have that ai brings freedom gianlucapistoia8993
687,resolute2834 yessss that destroys the space for art and leaves behind only content and we already have enough of that
688,gianlucapistoia8993 perfectly said and during this artpiece we put our own personal experiences emotions and perspective to literally anything we make people always make the argument that you don t need to spend much time learning how to draw animate when that is one of the major aspects of doing art is learning
689,resolute2834 yeah it s honestly quite sad how one of the first things humanity has done with advancements ai is to replace creatives and attempt to automate art
690,videos like the one of gold rush may be great for scientific and educational purposes if we say dinosaurs are green like lizards then ai generate a scientific document which dinosaurs are green if we say the medieval world like the witcher ai generate materials that could be used school
691,jpagh exactly generative ai won t always be accurate especially when it comes making images or video textual information is a different story using ai generated images something like a textbook my opinion is just wrong unless you are using it specifically to show how genai works
692,it can t take away creativity and imagination it only makes you re imagination to reality easy
693,that is the point of this program to destroy creativity it s happened throughout mankind s history usually through force brutality or social engineering this is just our current version the future has dark times ahead i m afraid
694,fcogabler as artist feel this take creativity to new levels and execute even greater ideas this is objectuvely great and help creativity and art
695,kingkarl2619 doesnt take away our creativity just cancel it because doesnt allow a process you aint no artist obviously
696,still the creative aspect can only be fulfilled by artist the human touch
697,this is the death of any educational value a video any and all historical videos have a 50 50 chance of being entirely fabricated by ai and hence worthless to learn from the general public won t know this though history be erased overwritten this is insane
698,the value what you do is not generated by the skills of individual that created it but by the value as percieved by individual that desires it resolute2834
700,you re right however i feel like this just increase the value of actual physical art made by a human hand like a drawing or painting on a canvas
701,joebroart that s a good point like the contrast between industry and handcraft it would be a great cultural mindset
703,gianlucapistoia8993 you don t seem to be artist this is why nobody cares that you guys are losing your jobs everyone else wants the end product to express themselves if you guys just like the process of making the art ai isn t stopping you
704,thecreativenick sure but that s a cope answer nobody would or should spend decades learning something if all they want is to simply express themselves like if we could press a button to make ourselves healthy nobody besides athletes and doctors would care about the process of becoming healthy the natural way
705,dillonblair6491 speak for yourself if you want to create content you definitely be able to do it faster with ai soon but it never be called art and i think what the world needs least of all is more content creators but maybe that s just me
706,gianlucapistoia8993 sure it s already called ai art and people are moving towards it and away from you guys it doesn t bother me
710,gianlucapistoia8993 i ve never worked you re defending people who make doodles for a living i wish my job that easy no democratization means anyone can participate you re upset because it hurts your bottom line because nothing is stopping you from making the art your issue is that you won t get our money now
711,dillonblair6491 open the window and get some air ai stan
713,a gang of educational porpoises let s feed that into the system
714,beautiful thanks for the high quality edit and excellent portrayal of todays news
715,cant wait to see taylor swift videos gonna be crazy lol
716,okay this is it the world is completely doomed now
718,my entire stock footage portfolio i ve spent years building has now been rendered obsolete tight sick
719,over the next year or two tens of millions of people are going to lose their job after that i don t know this is just the beginning
720,sucks time for a new skill
721,guitar333plumbers welders miners still needed
722,and when people started selling premade photos videos graphic elements website layouts they ruined business for other people but they didn t think twice it s good for some bad for others and it s how we push things into the future
723,and they use all stock footage as a foundation oof
724,guitar333 if you can pick on a cherry or any fruit from a tree and put it your mouth you survive ai can t stop you from doing that why y all afraid of ai
725,exactly forget about designing anime characters art concepts photography videogames etc lowing cost to creative industries by dismissing real creators
726,fcogabler that s why it s called industry
727,i d say learn to code but even that is kaput
728,sorry
729,skill issue
730,worst part is that if your work public then it may have been used to train the model without a licence or your consent
731,people theorize that a lot of this footage trained on shutterstock s database who are partners with this ai company
732,nornor bb6dn sure until robocop sees you then run
733,nornor bb6dn we want jobs to live a healthy life with no source of income is very diffuicult unless you already had some money saved up a lot of the creative types are gonna lose there jobs and ai is coming for other jobs too including the software people were kinda cooked
734,astra2 after that it ll be a convenient excuse for where the real goal is simply for the wealthy to reduce population thats probably why many of them are building bunkers
735,astra2 i think it might take a bit longer for the economic side effects to catch up but the next recession ai be a leading cause of unemployment
736,there still be a demand for authentic stock footage mainly from weird wealthy people i wouldn t delete it
737,the future is now old
738,i wanted to learn 3d rendering and stuff and make cool 3d animation this year not anymore i guess
739,nahin1968 you still can dude you can do it as a hobby don t let automation kill your passion we have massive industry that produces furniture yet my dad is still a woodworker because he loves doing it do not lose your passion
740,there are 9 million openings us
741,learn to code and you work the industry the makes ai generated movies someone most decide what is a good movie
742,
743,plau2007i doubt that coding save you ai can already code
744,iamsh1va i know but the end someone must use the software some because cod skills be helpful i think person with artistic skills and some basic coding succeed i think that mediocre software developers be first replaced by ai faster than artists
745,soon it s everything that doesn t require manual labour although that might be replaced by robots
746,this is the life everything is new now is your time to adapt to a new reality
747,progress always leaves some skills and careers obsolete it s rough for you but we re all better for it
748,ninewaves96 you aren t forced to use social media
749,open ai probably used it to train its plagiarism ai
750,zbruh3 ai take quite some time to be able to code like a human can do most high skill careers are secure for now
751,it s called creative destruction
752,theft of creatives
753,all of entertainment is doomed
754,the ai generated images and videos are dangerous to the brain specially to children because it does harm to the cognitive development this is really dangerous and need proper scientific study and legislation if you have access to researches psychologists neurologists or legislators please help make people aware of this danger
755,cristiangaban960 this is a very different direction it s not really comparable imo
756,guitar333 like what skill
758,astra2billions
759,hey my heart really goes out to you as a videographer and photographer i understand what emotions you re going through
760,still has its use
761,could animate them to video
762,coding is still a valuable skill you can t use ai for sophisticated algorithms where billions of dollars or lives are at stake even if a model could you would still want someone to double or triple check it then there is the task of keeping it up to date
764,plau2007 you know that ai can code right
765,sancheroid i know but if we talk about a movie a person with artistic skills decide if the result is ok or not i think persons with artistic skills and that know to code not at the software developer level have a lot of work to do
766,garyoak2974 not everyone can code some brains are different
767,they might have even trained sora on your stock material lol
768,i can t even imagine what a blow this is it s coming for all of us and sooner than we thought
769,astra2learn to use ai yourself itll save ur job
770,michalbartosz4878 it isn t a blow it is a opportunity ai is a tool that make us more productive we must just learn to use it
772,guitar333 it doesn t matter ai replace that skill as well
773,except for this i would pay you for your art i won t pay a computer for it
774,steveforsyth7269 you d pay someone for the same thing you can get for free
775,sucks to be you time for a new skill
776,not really if u have some kind of proof that it s not ai like a dated credentials then it s still useful
777,just adapt nothing is eternal ai is even bigger invention than internet you see
778,astra2or the one who uses the ai best gets the job
779,skill issue
781,as the politicians told people back 2016 learn to code
782,what makes you think you be allowed out of your pod that high rise shared communal prison you think they let you have fruit trees a backyard i m not joking some places are already talking about trying to stop people growing their own food a fight is coming future be ready
783,you can soon
784,cristiangaban960 yeah but it wasn t ruined by a robot and a single sentence
785,tufab3494 what is a camera to oil portrait painter especially digital cameras a push of a button
786,cristiangaban960 ok you have a point
787,skill issue l
788,zbruh3yeah human coding soon reach a point which it becomes obsolete the ability to read and understand code likely still be useful though
789,tight tight tight
790,zbruh3 yep and now we got devin
791,well your footage are probably the train data of the ai model they use part of your footage and you won t get a dune
793,astra2thank the lord my job would be impossible with ai
794,zbruh3 what code can you pls explain what is that i wanted to learn anime learning blender and found ai i still learn anime but i do want to be updated with ai
795,how to invest money into this company
796,might as well throw your money into a nearby drain a i is a colossally inflated bubble at the moment
797,i believe you can only invest indirectly through purchasing msft and infy stocks the other owners are private equity groups venture capitalists and individual company founders look up openai on wikipedia it has ownership info
798,just don t
799,a i can write music not to long ago it took samples of particular artists jimi hendrix amy whinehouse etc and generated music that sounded much like them the music performed by actual musicians but soon they probably wont be needed we can have a i hendrix song with a i music video
801,gmmgmmg i don t agree youtube jimi hendrix a i song the lost tapes it could easily fool someone i m sure it has just imagine the technology 10 years from now
802,leonagnew895 meh all i hear is awkward ai impersonation nothing new just chuck all jh production a blender and you come up with something that resembles it yeah but it s not a great song when ai can create a new voodoo child or a new beatles a day the life then i ll be impressed it won t be easy
803,gmmgmmg the problem is one day you ll hear a i generated track and not know that it s a i generated your prejudging this track if you wandered into a bar and a band playing this song and you ve never heard it before why would you not think it written by humans
805,maybe not live performance at least not yet a lot of fans love their favorite artist not because of their music but their personality and person as a whole but aspiring new artists definitely suffer
806,the only question is why fake it why ruin music it s time to stop i personally boycott ai music hard even if it is the best thing ever
807,money pure and simple people could use a i software for music films adverts travel videos you name it they ll save a ton of money as they won t have to pay for songwriters musicians producers etc astralyd
808,bad idea
809,of course it unfortunately be misused because humans are curious
810,the ceo of open ai confirmed they are going to launch open ai publicly after taking all safety measures
811,you can say that for literally anything anything resourceful can be used for both good and evil
812,someone tell sora to create a video of what would happen to the world if hitler got accepted to art school
813,the first comment i see is this i love you
814,netanyahu
815,considering the anger germans felt about reparations probably still a world ii just with a different leader and maybe no holocaust
816,notlordstark the antisemitism wasn t restricted to hitler s mind tho the holocaust could very much happen anyway
817,lucasdasilva23 true antisemitism at the heart of fascism anyway that might ve still happened difficult to say though hitler uniquely unhinged even for a fascist
819,hitler jokes never get old
820,nah bro
821,notlordstarkanti semiticism very much prevalent at time europe like today islamphobic
822,runajain5773 of course but that doesn t mean a holocaust is guaranteed i hope you re not making that comparison to say that you think europe is about to murder millions of islamic immigrants
823,people gate this comment but i love
824,maybe the events of red alert
825,no different from the collapsing world we have right now the question is what would happen if hitler won
826,it s openai that prompt be blocked just for having his name it
827,sweet burn
828,nooo noooo that s antisemitism you can t make joke like that here on youtube
829,that s already a movie it s called alternate
830,it won t do any political things
831,guitar333 same person different time
832,spacemeter3001the difference is actually hitler have a liked jews since they work hitler s liking while natenyahu openly claim he wants all dead a video
833,would love that
834,it all depends on what grades he d have got having seen his work he d probably have flunked and we d be back to square one
835,best idea ever
836,like family guy style too
837,is that some weird trump dystopian future
838,lucasdasilva23yup one thing i think played a huge part the events that unfolded the financial crisis the worker s party could ve easily found another hitler they were already extremely anti semite
839,netanyahu might not exist then
840,or if he didn t attack russia
841,someone else would be there the same problems would still exist
842,
843,considering this is openai and dall e is already very restricted on stuff relating to hitler it wouldn t go through
844,watch love death robots they did a episode on that
845,we are just the beginning of something beyond the imagination
846,notlordstarkonly may be
847,shimano sora
848,stamatis misirlis and it be nothing like any of you think end of days
849,i like that one
850,what if
851,or if eeews never invented communism
852,notlordstark wonder what jews done to other countries to be hated much and for long
853,nain
854,i not hitler
855,there goes my video editing job
856,if you are good at what you do you know tons about it just lern prompting and you ll be ahead of volks who never edited before and think pink
857,these are only 1 minute and be used mostly as stock footage i believe it be hard to replicate creativity but it is too early to tell how this shape our society
858,knuthackenholt8g how long do you think until even prompts are easy to use that you won t even need prompt engineers frankly they have already gotten much easier to use
859,your job is no danger for now if you are decent at it
860,dr w kruegerthat for now tho
861,nah not quite yet most of these ai videos lack nuance
862,are you kidding with more video footage available there be even more need for video editors
863,rexs 5188give it 1 or 2 years then these videos become longer than 1 minute and be a movie s length
864,it won t happen
865,123coffsnope it ll advance far that you won t need to do anything to it or the edits can be made by the ai
866,ai is a wonderful invention but can be disastrous if not regulated it should be banned for political and social messages and used only the sectors of agriculture and healthcare
867,regulations can be implemented but there always be people that find ways around it this is gonna open ai black market
868,this is the next great step into future technology that write history
869,that s the dangerous thing when you have the power not only to write history but to rewrite it
870,just time for nvidia earnings call next week
871,i ve been waiting for a pop the stock because of sora folks are asleep
872,meta and google be like
873,tech nobody asked for
874,deal with it
875,visionentertainment8006 stop getting upset and hiding it behind short statements if you re gonna cry just be honest about it
876,noahfletcher3019 you re one crying about technological progress that you never stop you sound scared deal with it
877,multi billion dollar corporations are currently a ai arms race what are u talking about lol
878,wedoalittlemonkeybusiness6545 lol not even a good question yeah we didn t ask for them to have this race we however spend our money on consuming what they make from it it s just human nature
880,deelee5958 being excited after something has been made is not the same as wanting that thing
881,noahfletcher3019ill clear it up for you then i m excited for this and very much want this if you bother to do major research into ai you would agree things change yes but things always change people freak out when any new tech comes along line get better we survive
882,noahfletcher3019 any technology needs continuous improvement and progress please give them some time and they eventually become what you want
883,watch us go back to the middle age we have to recreat alternative human society from food to housing etc let mr altman gates etc enjoy their new society where we are all out of jobs and they are trillionaires
884,is it grabbing a gazilllion videos and images and mashing it together to fit its narrative all harvested from the internet
885,wonder if the public media police can distinguish between real phones videos and ai generated ones like if alleged crime or political scandal happened with photo video evidence
886,video by itself hardly constitutes evidence court it has been like that for years videos can already be faked
887,very soon they absolutely not be and at some point experts won t either
888,it would be easy for the ai to create individual hash for each photo or video created you could just look up a video or photo and determine if the ai created it given that openai would implement that feature
889,we ll get back to film for probatory stuff
890,they probably won t launch it to the public general because of that must be training law enforcement with counter ai tools or i would like to believe
891,this is the answer defox721
892,compute be the only limiting factor the average joe probably doesnt have rtx 4090 money
894,use ai to distinguish ai
895,defox721 the problem is space do u know how many terabyte and servers u need to store and archive them every second a new ai content is being created
896,defox721completely unviable with the scale this isn t going to work
897,ai hey silicone valley artists now your services are precindible good bye dye
898,i want to see wrestlemania title match between donald trump and joe biden
899,be careful what you wish for you might just get it
900,why stop there when we can see a bear fight a lion
901,hahaha oh this hasn t even been released yet and it s already going too
902,for which title bro
903,unfortunately openai won t let you do it due to copyright issue
904,marvel vs dc mashup or garbage pail kids vs stinkblasters clafflin493
905,tyson vs ali both their prime
906,spacedolphinposadistthere are already real footages of that
907,i could tell you about 57 years would you cat on on your lap
908,spacedolphinposadist ok but what if they had rocket launchers
909,juelz4516 unifying the old heavyweight and incompetental championships
910,i want to see a 2 hour long proper political debate between biden and trump my request is simple but trump seems incapable
911,fitybux4664 why would you want to see that
912,sora open ai is going to displace many jobs like drone operators 3d animators and videographers how to survive this
913,dont see how it would replace videographers
914,veilmai did you check sora it can create almost any type of video just with a couple of words i don t see a reason not to replace videographers as well that s a pain too
915,theaigirl sophie ubi
916,theaigal it is a bit more complicated than this but it sure have a very big impact on the industry but we as human have to decide if we go back to medieval times as serf and our kings masters with the likes of altman and gates
917,i doubt it would replace drone operators there are still plenty of of uses for drones other fields like engineering rescue etc
918,think up new jobs using human creativity or help push the transition towards fully automated luxury communism
919,r2dk594 yes i m not saying everyone is going to be replaced but we can generate many drone footage with this tool and there are drones which are programmed they scan and give data on their own yes there are 2 sides some jobs are going to be replaced some are not but that affects many people
920,establishmentottoman315ubi is not gonna happen
921,change to a trade that isn t easily replaceable by a i or become a luddite
922,theaigirl sophie but this isnt real footage videographers capture real footage
923,veilmai yea only for specific scenaries
925,incredible video
927,i feel like using ai for marketing perfect ways to hack humans to buy stuff is hella abusive and should be curtailed
928,she didn t drop any tips of value methinks
929,a lot of word salad lol
930,boring video it s more exciting to search for ai marketing on google scholar and i even know 5x more
931,all the opposite embrace your multipotentialite nature don t specialise
932,ted wnt down and down lol
933,great video powerful
935,more constant social engineering
936,ai is the new era
937,9 56 disgusting
938,seeing the same advertisements and content on social media a bigger amount and sounding the same is a real threat very insightful thank you
939,loved your thoughts on ai driven marketing jessica if you are aiming for a sequel please do consider mystrika it is a cold email tool but oh boy it is way more than that the a b testing and detailed analytics have transformed my campaigns a video on it would truly be enriching
940,great points made this video jessica however i would love if you could do episode on mystrika someday it is a cold email tool i have been using and damn it is amazing their email warmup feature is top notch and the inbox rotation option is unique count me as a fan
941,comming up by the perfect product ye right marketers came up with it and not the engineers or designers actualy more like stoled the idea and send it to china to be made by forced labers and then paketed the profit
942,this is someone who s job sector is facing extinction along with many others ai not be persuaded by charisma
943,did anyone try the digital wealth academy digital marketing course
944,notes use ai to create useful ads clear and direct like a trade offer you get x a great slam offer exchange for y including all costs make the ads pleasant to the senses make the ads relevant
947,thankfully management be the last domino to fall
948,firstly the mentality
949,bad pronunciation
950,a sales video
951,ibm just slashed thier marketing team lmao and the stock popped marketing is cooked ibm just move over 1 programmer to do the job of like 5 marketing people
953,
954,can someone please point me to the studies she mentioned the video
955,i m a left brain ai marketer what courses should i take or what s my next step
956,greed is everlasting timeless
957,incredible this is a masterpiece of content i recently read a similar book and it unforgettable experience game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness by jack frostwell
958,bill hick s opinion on marketers right internet great when it my friends posting stuff without concern of it being advertisement now all i see on social media even from my friends ads all ads i don t use it much anymore if i do i m hyper aware i m opening my advertisement viewing apps
959,exactly what i looking forward to thanks for the amazing insights
960,hello excellent reflexion right now i doing my doctoral studies marketing and i have excellent point of view that i agree with you despite i have my master s degree digital technologies
961,hi where are you doing your doctoral studies from
962,i doing my doctoral studies marketing what is your research topic i m exploring generative ai advertising s influence on purchase intention
963,another problem with over personalization is the absence of discovery much focus on personalization makes a biiiiiiig assumption that we all know what we want and what we like not true at all
964,what a waste of space this woman
965,phlanx s caption generator is the ultimate solution for businesses seeking a competitive edge the digital realm craft captions that not only engage but convert making every piece of content a valuable asset your revenue generating strategy
966,wanna go for a picknick
969,think out of the box ai is limited with brand self data and bricks
970,felt like ad for boston consulting group not where i would turn for creative advice
972,110 fluff
973,verry good
974,i ve grown tired of the word content
975,discover the best website builders of 2024
976,a tiktok marketing agency owner and is heavily using chatgpt yes what happens is i work more lol
977,well said
978,i do hope a concept of counter anti marketing tools be introduced with the advent of ai as well something like antimarketing similar to antivirus or noise cancelling
980,it totally chatgpt generated you could tell by her pauses and words
982,cultivate ai and you ll have a superpower it s sound good enough
983,originate original ideas
985,who can share the bcg hbs ai x marketing study she refers to
986,ai can help identify trends based on historical patterns but human decisions and creative aspects are often still required for new ideas and innovation the use of ai data analysis can provide valuable insights but humans still have a key role developing new ideas and facing emerging challenges the future
987,i trust myself
988,it s not like boom agi it s more like boom boom bo boom bo bom bo boom bo bo bo bo boom a g i during that time we can use ai as a tool until we can t or we don t have to
989,what s gonna happen to this video gonna copy paste the transscript into chat gpt and extract the key takeaways via bullet points update 3mins later got the entire talk next
990,the simple solution however be filter out everything which may sound as marketing or advertising simply we do not want to waste our time on being manipulated the obvious outcome
991,marketing has tried its best to ruin the internet and society general
992,were toast society is ruined that too many people like generative ai another mental health issue the internet is a dumpster fire
994,the opening statement is simply not true we are working less than we ever had she should look at the studies
995,perhaps marketers should start by taking ownership of how their work has blindsided consumers from the various social ills that have been inflicted by their bosses and think about how that supercharged productivity simply allow them to mislead consumers and governments at scale
996,this be accelerating international market which develop over time ted is usually ahead of the curve
997,i m about a week into the ai algorithm feed on youtube i m hearing a lot of the use of the words predictive and model my question is why aren t weather forecasts for the weekend or next week super accurate now if the answer is garbage garbage out then not much has changed
998,i m glad that she s trying to save marketing
999,5 minutes and shes said almost nothing of value and she works marketing
1000,ai accomplish the same thing that robotics did it put people out of work back the 60s they all lauded the easier lives we would have by benefiting from new production technology they were wrong then and they are still wrong now those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
1002,it actually helpful thanks
1003,thanks
1004,the point about why personalized content is bad is not summarized aptly she placed more importance on the convergence of what is pushed at you and content overload
1005,amazing thanks
1006,how did you do that
1007,very helpful indeed could ai have delivered her message could ai have provided the summary you presented
1008,thanks
1009,bro thank you much a hug from brazil
1010,thx
1011,thank you
1012,equally not knowing what this video wants to say
1013,can we see the prompt
1014,bro your comment is gold thanks for saving many people i too struggled to fully grasp her point
1015,do you smell that a little bit like bull a little bit more like sheet
1016,incredible video
1017,if i ruled the world marketing would be outlawed consumerism is destroying the world
1018,didn t you use your phone or laptop to type this lol
1019,are we still talking about right brain and left brain 2023
1020,lame
1021,it s super amazing most likely this ted
1022,ik klikte omdat ik me even lekker wou storen aan haar nederlandse accent maar helaas heeft ze dat niet klinkt meer een beetje russisch
1024,marketing is definitely not sales and vice versa as proof the relative percentage of people who can crossover into either function is low
1025,marketing is definitely not sales
1026,seven7vii7 hahaha wow talk about 2 months late to the comment section redundant and maladroit brilliant d
1027,miguelwc well you re still wrong
1028,seven7vii7 hahahahah
1029,seven7vii7 hahahaha
1030,well you missed the basics marketing is selling by consumer satisfaction marketing is all about making awareness about a product service and selling is persuading customer directly to purchase the product marketing lays foundation for selling marketing is a broader subject please work on your fundamentals
1031,empoweringsuccess yeah yeah semantics it all comes from the same place
1032,miguelwcsalespeople don t know the first thing about seo ppc ad campaign creation or management email newsletter copywriting creating effective product descriptions or graphic design tools or principles of any sorts this is like comparing hr to financial completely different
1033,cameronf3343 what ever
1034,i hate advertisements always have and likely always i hate when someone attempts to convince me to buy something i don t need for a price that is unreasonable everything this lady says the first 5 minutes sounds like a fucking nightmare to me yet she says it with such enthusiasm and zeal like that projected future is a good thing
1035,ai marketing is revolutionizing the way businesses connect with their audience the data driven insights and personalized experiences it enables are game changers today s dynamic digital landscape exciting times ahead for marketers embracing the power of ai
1036,comment written by ai lol
1037,allhailthelegs
1038,well said truly
1039,quite vague and pretentious could have definitely used some inspiring best practice examples
1040,i don t fully agree with the content of that video new ai tools are able to create contents with complete new ideas idk about the future of people working as marketers
1041,as much as i appreciate information i feel bad towards other academic sources that isn t a i ted really follows that algorithm to a tee
1042,it s obvious that they re trying to sell out the idea of ai seeing how ai related topics are plastered all over their recent videos tbh
1043,bold of her to assume that ai not straight up replace marketing people alltogether i very much doubt that ai fail at creativity this felt vague and like a business meeting with a boss who just throws keywords around
1044,i completely agree consultants do what they do best
1045,be late to realizing the truth then at the point you ve seen the bitter reality that humans have become primitive animals you ll be too late to input kind of effective measurements which unfortunately seems to be how the majority of people think right now lol
1046,your words would actually mean something if you are someone who works marketing not saying that you have no right to comment it is just that that is what lacks the comment section like blind people leading the blind meh
1047,
1048,did autopilot replace pilots
1050,her point about reducing generative outcomes is spot on
1051,educate yourself before speaking
1052,if you thought there wasn t enough b s the world
1053,right fucked up stuff
1054,maybe this cause much bullshit people finally stop believing it maybe people actually be critical of what they read fat chance
1055,another bs ai we have every data the whole world about everything
1056,sirdiealot53if the best way to predict future behavior is by looking at past behavior we re fucked
1057,marketing is bs it to maintain superfluous ppl within busy work
1058,i predict the future a director llm with a a small army of llm specialist make most of marketing functions obsolete the next 3 5 years because it outperform most marketers for a fraction of the costs leadership does not want creativity they want outcomes
1059,this year it start happening this year humans be outperformed shor time
1060,i look forward to the downfall of marketing aka corporate propaganda
1063,hi
1064,we need to ditch the dichotomies and focus on continuums my brain is both left and right
1066,you have no touch with reality agi not change everything 5 years
1067,cringe
1068,short term linear narrow visi n i bet for how irrelevant marketing could be with no sustainable goods and even services services meaning society not even reach the rate of childs necessary to keep on that market
1070,what impacts me the most it is what she has told about our ideas being the core of ai there is time to keep creating for more to be generated loving it
1071,it means tha we might see a future which only original thinkers have opportunities
1073,you assume we all want more time off i don t i need money to pay bills are you covering my mortgage and school loans with your great leisure plans i think not
1074,ai and robotics may be cost effective however if more and more people lose jobs who be able to buy products bread lines of the great depression are looming
1075,i think everyone need own a ai robots and make it work instead of human everyone can get and ues money that robots earn
1076,cool
1077,i fundamentally disagree with this conception of left and right brains u don t need to be left brained to do math word problems and not right brain to realise women buy purses more than men
1078,ai is most dangerous as a propaganda tool it can destroy our ability to tell fact from fiction
1079,nice ted talk meanwhile reality for most companies marketing is still the same sales oriented and lying producing department responsible for promoting imaginary products that are completely disconnected from the reality of the production departments and the terms and conditions of delivering the product
1080,marketing a waste of human talent anyways good riddance
1081,the constant search for greater efficiency quality of life diminishes and people are just seen as consumers sad
1082,my brain is blocking all advertisements and marketing i stopped watching this video halfway to much content to consume next
1083,the information age is still relative new what maybe 50 years it evolve over production and consumption of content eventually self regulate
1084,this is what a marketer looks like i sometimes forget that they actually have a human form creepy
1085,shup up nothing surpass human
1086,shup up
1087,ai gang gang
1088,said the bot
1089,people do still not realise how impactful agi be it vastly outdo the impact of the discovery of fire or electricity by a factor of thousand this lady lives a fantasyland that may exist for a couple of years while agi is still its infancy and then completely vanish
1090,if it falls into the wrong hands it may happen what are you saying
1091,whatever hands it falls it happen the world 10 years be completely unrecognisable the end of fossil fuels free energy it be messy putin gone arab countries insignificant just 2 minor things joaquinmontero9081
1092,the main point to your thesis is not clear you re suggesting that the subject she s talking about is going to be incredibly impactful but then you mentioned that she lives a fantasy land she s highlighting the machine human interaction and you re only highlighting one side of it why
1094,of course comparing ai tools to productivity tools as word processing and spreadsheet is a joke
1095,there is no sufficient evidence we are close to creating a true agi
1096,joaquinmontero9081there is no wrong or right hands independent technology beyond human competence is not something you can own any real sense the legal fiction of intellectual property is impotent against the massive changes material conditions brought by potential agi
1097,she vastly underestimates the effects of agi she sees a tiny part her own field without seeing the effect it have on everything alchemiststable
1098,
1099,
1100,gammaraygemyou are right most of people have no idea how agi change everything
1101,it s not like boom agi it s more like boom boom bo boom bo bom bo boom bo bo bo bo boom a g i during that time we can use ai as a tool until we can t or we don t have to
1102,yes and when this happens i assure you the discussion not be around marketers
1103,anantverma40 who s living a fantasy land you or she you don t sound like you know you know what you talking about
1104,you re all living fairyland if you don t understand that the real threat to social cohesion is not artificial intelligence but those who are manipulating and attempting to socially engineer society via advertising right now
1105,we are decades from agi
1107,studying
1108,ai continue to stay relevant for thousands more years i guess humans are no longer needed for marketing
1109,first comment
1110,wow
1111,google translate built 1995 lol
1112,good video i learn from it about generating ai thanks
1113,siri as generative ai puke
1114,if humanities text input on the internet is responsible for creating these models why do we have to pay anything to use chatgpt 4 chatgpt 5 et cetera we are the creators not microsoft or google
1115,she is the best trainer on earth on ai and ml superb video
1117,no wonder google ai is woke people like you made it woke
1119,mirella lapata s ability to simplify complex topics with vivid examples is truly commendable her presentation style is both insightful and accessible
1120,the danger are the engineers who put into these programs lies such as classifing donald trump as a dictator cause future consequences
1121,thank you for the lively input on this conversation about ai and generative models this beautiful
1122,but can it write a 60k page novel that a human reader can t put down and once finished can t forget it that s the ultimate turing test for understanding human ontology not proving or refuting the reimann hypothesis as wonderful as the latter would be
1123,good one
1124,not recommendable channel
1125,yes climate change may be the biggest risk to humanity but ai is going to accelerate that quickly with energy use
1126,amazing presentation on one of the crucial topic the age of artificial intelligence exciting to see the simplicity and flow of clearly understanding the core principles of the subject thank you prof for this lecture
1127,understanding what level flat flat flat and non sense try to think
1128,really great job refreshing real energy easy to understand thank you
1129,need help i have a doubt by with the graph on 25 33 that what is the difference between words and parameters
1132,the thumbnail is wow
1133,thank you much for explaining such a complex subject this brilliant easy way much appreciate this
1134,very easy to understand thank you
1137,master watch procedure
1138,18 55 trust me when you said transformers they remembered optimus prime not neural networks
1139,great presentation but why does the last slide always focus on the implications of ai and then quickly move on it s equally if not more important to delve deeper into this topic
1140,horses all those cars took our jobs
1141,pp0pp
1142,thank you
1143,a biased presentation it s a turn off
1145,where we go wrong is when ai starts to teach humans but as long as humans are the one teaching ai or programming then humanity wont be lost but when ai outdoes humans then humans be at the bottom ai should be to assist human not become human
1146,isnt anything with algorithm to work considered ai since it learns from algorithms to are the best choose and learns from that to make another decision it learns from the certain algorithm isnt a set of algorithms the same as ai basically it s all coding ai is coding
1147,generative ai is the ask jeeves you type a question and it throws back a bunch of results generative ai summarises selected results and gives you a content e g text for your to grasp most cases it s a cheat paragraphs not by author inserted one of your readings
1148,brilliant the best talk on gen ai for a layman and techie alike kudos ms lapata
1149,let not give up our programing journey bc the ai never stand to manage and move all the issues a company but humans remain the best got into my channel and see how we do flash and you can got your on software before is to late
1150,a wonderful session
1151,as we are using data from dfrnt sources like quora etc how we are going to train the model future because may we have less data future as all people move to gen ai for their ans
1152,siri is not generative ai apple say that it have ai built into it 2024 the fuss began 2022 not 2023 with the launch of chatgpt 3 0
1153,siri is a type of generative ai it uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user queries a conversational manner
1154,i m very proud that by law the usa does not recognize titles of alleged royalty
1155,really great presentation thanks for sharing
1156,very simply and nicely explained gen ai
1157,yes i not on the 2011 tools setting l m rejoining 2022 sometimes audio sounds good and yes l on that time interested
1158,the simplistic explanation shows her depth of understanding the subject matter loved it kudos to the prof
1159,insightful loved the whole video great speaker
1160,climate change lol prob diversity change
1161,we as humans can put ai and ml to work and do most of the work and then distribute the income to all citizens of the country to eradicate poverty but under strict laws
1162,not possible human being is greedy nature equal distribution means bill gates mukesh ambani and one truck driver get equal distribution of money i personally can not imagine yes to get rid of poverty we need to think seriously and find out some other ways
1163,amazing lecture
1164,indeed
1165,even ai doesn t know why people use iphones she says it s programmed not to be biased and than goes on to say it insult men but won t say anything about women
1166,great lecture thank you
1167,amazing lecture it easy to understand
1168,fantastic explanation very scary future for humans ooer
1169,all these ai and ml are made by who the first place then how can they then be intelligent than their makers humans i guess that explains the reason why their intelligence is artificial and not natural
1170,gorgeous professor
1171,when we have complex technologies explained such clarity and understanding there is nothing to say but to salute the presenter excellent presentation my 10year old could simply understand the technology behind generative ai chatgpt4 and all the inherent benefits and risk associated thanks prof
1172,she is real and passionate about what she is talking
1173,lovely ai basics tutorial from a wonderful astute and intelligently likeable speaker
1174,
1176,well said
1177,courage the cowardly dog perhaps the first user of chat gpt his chat gpt even had a good sense of humor
1178,very good presentation
1180,amazing lecture loved the way merella explained each aspect of gen ai without going into much technical details
1182,mirella lapata s clarity on the subject this is very easy even for a non technical person to understand
1183,this presentation is very easy to follow and understand great
1184,nice session
1185,thx
1186,thank you much
1187,excellent excellent lecture 3
1188,what a wonderful and knowledgable speech
1189,this is great and presenter is very clear about her explanation i would suggest to everyone must watch thanks
1190,it a great presentation and explained most clearly
1191,great presentation
1192,3d dimensional graph
1193,cool
1195,20 53
1196,genious
1197,thanks for sharing
1198,partial and selective
1199,i just sat before the screen to learn about ai and saw this video i knew nothing about ai or chat gpt only heard about them but i able to understand whatever she said within my own limits thank you for this video ms mirella
1200,rubbish ai is supposed to be ani for being non intelligence nature
1201,a i as it stands today it is computational statistic model generative a i is statistic model of action based on the a i model
1202,generative ai models are trained on copyright protected data is that legal
1203,informative and very interesting thank you
1204,this is actually somewhat incorrect siri google translate and google search are more traditional ai
1205,you are a gifted communicator nice simplification
1206,generative ai don t exist acutaly ai don t exist stop using misleading ignorant title nowadays ai is just a marketing term that is absolutely meaningless if you want get some credibility just don t behave like clowns or is your agenda keep people ignorant shame on you
1207,harmless politically correct
1208,iphones are popular because it is a status symbol
1210,mirella thank you you are full of wisdom like athena
1211,fantastic lecture to present something considered complex very simple language
1214,comment brought to you by generative ai
1215,great presentation thank you
1216,thoroughly unpersuasive her discussion of the risks and completely failed to address emergent capabilities the genesis of which must be fully understood before proceeding
1217,what is generative
1218,great lecture smart choice of words and examples to explain hard to understand concepts well done mirella
1219,excellent presentation but i found one glitch at 43 11 time berners lee did not invent the internet but the www
1220,how said they can use my movement new i can t sue americans people wat they doing to me it s evil job
1221,to moon i didn t no i have job americans
1222,this lecture actually is displaying the logical and creative limitations and boundaries of gpt i certain many people reading my comment be outraged that s what is expected
1223,great lecturer
1224,tomorrow is not mystery now
1225,great presentation on genai
1226,the speaker s small talk annoying
1227,thank you much for this interesting material early greek are real builders behinde our modern civilization
1228,12 11
1229,human generates as long as he she thinks but too easily distracted by surrounding and within one self agi just look for pattern to pin point and hardly with any distraction haha
1230,thank you for a very accessible eloquent and enjoyable video
1231,when you see the energy wit and passion of this wonderful lady you understand that ai has still a looong way to go
1232,interesting useful and good presentation skills thank you
1233,
1235,a little correction berners lee didn t invent the internet he invented the web the intuitive user environment interlinked and formatted by hypertext that is carried on the internet understandable slip though since the vast majority of people have only ever interacted with the internet through this construct
1236,master oogway plagiarized
1237,this is nothing but a marketing ploy under the guise of intellectual engagement
1238,ai on average regresses towards average what she suggesting is not ai transcending space or time but little bit of fear mongering as usual as already been done by other elites or their disciples to create another financial bubble ai rarely touches the frontier of outliers and that is just the basic fact
1239,still it is based on programming and nothing else there is no necessity for demystification because thefe is nothing mysterious about ai
1240,why are all comments favorable agents of good ai is going to transform everything but we must draw some red lines
1241,thanks
1242,how does a model understand what is toxic and harmful
1243,excellent presentation
1245,damn that s cool
1246,if these gen ai can predict lottery number then il believe it
1247,what is mathematical model of interaction
1248,lots of things we need are not yet exposed to human becaue people dont actually think what they need
1249,he generation of john3 3 eternally blessed
1250,just a few minutes but is this a propaganda talk or a science one stop telling me what is or isn t controversial or dangerous or not all while not even addressing what the dangerous implications even are
1251,for the record there is no argument for texting and driving i believe there is a discussion to be had about hands free devices
1252,life finds a way what if whenever the a i creates a new thing nature evolution the universe god whatever our species wants to call it acts on that creation and without the a i knowing these lil bits of code are spontaneously creating allowing for the anomalies seen the a i s of today just a thought ol neb
1253,generative ai seems redundant isn t ai already supposed to be generative
1255,this is a very very general intro about gen ai
1256,ai artworks neural networks transformers layers of blocks of data banks and super computing devices and generic models fine tuned language models
1257,lost me at neural networks what is that
1258,network of neurals
1259,i really enjoy this lection
1260,excellent many thanks for all your efforts and sharing this
1261,excellent and clear lecture for the general public it s meant to be a divulgation lecture
1262,poetry hhhaiqu
1263,a very very good explanation the presenter is very fluent presenting and speaking clear vocabs
1264,good video and clear explanation for everyone to understand well done ms mirella lapata
1265,this bs 08 00 is rubbish it means nohing that it took google translae 78 months 2006 to get x users it is a totally different use case and it a totally differen world your arguments are intellectually dishonest and mean nothing
1266,very naive thinking that agi not pose a huge risk the future with deep fakes and high intelligence it could easily manipulate humans
1267,the trump and women answer proves that the model has extreme bias
1268,this presentation is for someone that has been living under a rock for the last two years
1270,the computer has created many inventions this is written on the internet
1271,is this the woman who played trinity the matrix
1272,38 57 some new world psychopaths have trained the ai
1273,excellent video
1274,wonderful presentation with clarity however the beginning she said she wont keep the audience hanging however as no one can predict the future i felt hanging at the end of the session
1275,lovely and memorable presentation
1276,love it
1277,not a very good presenter
1278,that means agi can some up with say a new john lennon song john lennon s voice
1279,why not
1281,2 27 i thought that quote master oogway s
1282,brilliant explanation thank you much i finally understand how it works
1283,a complex topic explained on simpler terms outstanding
1284,absent intelligence
1285,brilliant comprehensible to architect you computer geeks go elsewhere
1286,lovely presentation
1287,she needs to learn basic math
1288,scale affects everything the world to a large or small extent this is true for analog systems mechanical systems or here everything
1289,is the ai new world order out of order
1290,how many people has automobiles killed
1291,why didn t the teacher condemn the fact that chatgpt could make joke about men but not women
1292,great talk
1294,24 18 gpt4 does not need 100 trillion parameters because backprop is 100x more efficient at cramming knowledge into weights than the human brain into synapses
1297,always find it a little concerning when the lecturer says something like you don t need to worry about this just trust me that it s right
1298,at 18 50 if i recall correctly she asked how many knew about transformers and got a good amount of applause i really wonder what percentage thought she asking about giant robots and how many thought she referring to devices that change electrical voltage it more applause than i would have expected
1299,yeah she s thinking her audience is from kindergarten
1300,i came to the comment section looking for this comment i completely agree
1301,natalyrobles00 i got confused when they apllauded
1302,some truth may hurt your feelings but should i lie about the lack of competence and understanding the climate hysteric woman delivered on the topic of generative ai and its risk for humanity the royal institution should present someone better
1303,beautifully presented honetly just relatable refreshing and just the right blend of everything
1306,google seldom guesses the remainder of what search i want this is not a failure of ai but my own idiosyncratic searches i don t like framing questions but a simple key word search that is the words only not how they are related
1309,training puts data into the hash but there is no method to subtract bad data from that hash after it has been introduced
1310,2 05
1311,2 39
1312,great
1313,excellent introduction thank you mirella and ri
1314,great presentation thank you
1315,thanks helped a lot
1316,always a great pleasure to listen to these lectures from the royal institution
1317,well that clears that up
1318,superb lecture very insightful
1320,most commenters just say how great the video is nice to see someone point out something other than that
1322,ai made simple excellent lecture for simple folks like me
1324,a fresh air of presenting generative ai from different perspectives wonderful to watch
1327,excellent lecture performed by mirella much things learned
1328,very clear delivery of a complex topic thanks
1329,tim berners lee invented the internet mirella lapata is a gpt bot ps excellent lecture
1330,indeed he invented the www not the internet but i sure this meant as such by mirella
1331,m16jgb yes i guessed as much but it fun to see example of a delightfully intelligent human getting it wrong for the same reason ai might that s what the internet corpus says
1332,m16jgbon a next computer
1335,always business people and managers hype don t listen or trust they show complex mathematics as employee you should care for yourself and economic ways that s why individual responsibility is necessary individual production is necessary for any economic needs company don t care
1336,i came into this lecture thinking ai could never replace a human lecturer and left hoping it would and quickly
1337,thanks for the 1 394 302 003th explanation at the pace of tech this morning yesterday
1338,there is no ai intelligence can never be artificial it is all programmed consciousness rainbow pictures our eternal consciousness reality a circuit of abilities
1339,excellent explanation of ai technology great lecture thank you for describing
1340,a song is a song how is it supposed to know that you wanted 2 lines weird
1341,absolutely brilliant lecture
1342,this person is unintentionally informing us that ai is the process of creating a world where 3 4 of the population are non working and have all their basic needs satisfied while the remaining humans be the adventurers ie the hierarchy that s the future
1343,humans are obsolete
1344,awesome thank you much
1345,never mind text tell us about generative video
1346,simple maths problem if it takes 1 hour to dry 2 towels on a long line how long does it take to dry 4 towels the correct answer is 1 hour chat thinks it is 2 hours it doesn t understand the context
1347,predict vs understand is crucial here
1348,ask again here s chat gpt 4 answer if it takes 1 hour to dry 2 towels on a long line assuming space and drying conditions are consistent it would still take 1 hour to dry 4 towels because they can all dry simultaneously if there is enough space on the line
1349,if 2 towels take 1 hour to dry then it would take 1 hour for 4 towels to dry on the same washing line the number of towels doesn t affect the drying time this scenario
1350,from chatgpt
1351,vroomikno
1352,don t waste your time watching this
1353,i just checked out chatgpt and order to register they wanted my mobile number why end of registration
1354,personally i don t think fine tuning is answer to the alignment problem fact the methods of fine tuning and specialization can be used for all sorts of purposes i wonder how a large language model trained on the written works of machiavelli would advise or suggest or provide answers to questions about violence
1355,withut javascipt yes
1356,no javascript
1357,no javascript
1358,no
1359,ai is just comparing then coming up with results
1360,they have the iphones from watching ads
1361,ask chatgpt please explain the logic behind your answer please
1362,i just read the news today about stack overflow layoff their staff because everyone is using chat gpt
1363,great talk as a small correction tim berners lee didn t invent the internet he invented de world wide web www and protocols associtated
1364,many mistakes were made i assume it s overexcitement on mirella s part
1365,exactly a geologist making the distinction mistake would be entirely excusable ai specialist not much
1366,genuinely terrible lecture like listening to my neighbor casually parrot stuff they heard on a podcast stuff happend and it s genius trust me
1367,if you didn t find value the video there s no reason to announce your lack of imagination to the world it s embarrassing just trying to help you out
1368,i thought it just me she s charming though i watched the whole thing
1369,wow let s all be fragile and say only positive things this has nothing to do with imagination this supposed to be a science talk and yet there s no substance ri should aim for better
1370,good enough and simple to understand
1371,i wish i had a neighbour like you informative and energetic at the same time not sure what the audience level is and if this is introduction to generative ai this is exactly what i would expect
1372,u7ku
1373,had to put my volume down to watch some more why people that spend their time with 6 years old games think they are big scientists
1374,fabulous r2d2 come to life
1375,you are wrong this is a good lecture
1376,there is a reason why she is a professor and you are not how can i tell that you are not from your comment
1377,r s 9762 bad comment from a scientific prrson like you
1378,thumper what did your father tell you if you can t say somethin nice don t say nothin at all ok
1380,this is really uninformative i could have given that speech based on my current layman knowledge nice delivery but zero insight she didn t even mention the research paper that google published suggesting different architectures that gave open ai many of its ideas
1381,incredible lecture thank you much tri and mirella
1382,really helpful and reassuring partly because it s not mansplaining
1383,oh ffs
1384,you are right it s not mansplaning indeed it s womensplaining stuff happend and it s genius trust me
1385,rasis
1386,too bad that they stole lots of art and has the potential to become the greatest tool of exploitation that we ll ever see
1388,berners lee invented the world wide web not the internet
1389,i thought this weird al
1390,
1391,wonderful presentation thank you
1392,not certain what transformers are but they are unmistakably a game changer
1393,is it possible to download these slides ppt from somewhere
1394,i m sure you can google her and find email and ask her for it most academics have no issues doing that
1395,thank your for that suggestion i try to reach out to her steliosp1770
1396,helpful demystifies certain things great talk thanks
1397,ai is the code that ai is programmed with that s it
1398,it s not programmed exactly the programmers create the code that trains and executes a model but the model itself is trained not programmed that s why it s dangerously unpredictable no one can understand what s going on inside the model it s impossible to fine tune or to remove some undesired behaviour after training
1399,vylbird8014why is it left wing then
1400,thedude8046perhaps because your perspective might be right leaning
1402,immyyousafzai sounds logical very logical
1404,makes me think of a classic 1962 his book profiles of the future inquiry into the limits of the possible science fiction writer arthur c clarke formulated his famous three laws of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
1406,
1407,but nn nn h kilo him ok j
1408,i m personally excited at the possibility of limited ai language modeling for video games but they ll need to work on it being damn long winded once it gets going it never stops
1409,break free 10 05
1410,you lose the to live
1412,this comment is as good as the talk itself
1414,i want to remind you how many w watts your brain use vs how much our silly ai is using and it s mostly focused on appeasing the folks rlhf and hf not included into the entropy we are creating a technology that has emergent qualities this is the case as we emerged from protoplasm the ai as you pour energy compute on it
1416,but ai on average regresses towards average what you are suggesting is not ai transcending space or time but just fear mongering as have already been done by other elites or their disciples to create another financial bubble ai rarely touches the frontier of outliers and that is just the basic fact
1417,
1418,good bad world s feed sand seeds land deeds
1419,
1420,1qq
1421,interesting 3 36
1423,first gloria doesnt count its a bot haha
1424,report it
1425,it s the fucking nuclear bomb shit all over again
1426,ai is like the wizard of oz beneath the veil of a powerful and mysterious entity there just a operating the machinery for his own purpose as the machine itself what seen as the wizard has no self determination
1427,i fear all ai no exception other than the open source one if done well
1428,open source isn t what it used to be it s not liberating diffusion model or llm blackbox nobody would read that would pollute infospace through from giant lime meta not the one with mozzila wikipedia linux philosophy to train on private data using more than 10 24flops of compute this isn t open source
1429,open source has always been the answer for many computing problems
1430,ai is not intelligence it is a weapon system
1431,
1433,next stage of slavery begin with closed source ai
1434,land of the free until moneh is involved then we push for legislation against our competitors
1435,
1436,if you think it s a conspiracy theory you ve been living under a rock companies have been pulling crap like this forever but never on such a scale
1437,which os is that at 0 43
1438,why this 1 07 czarodziej kurwa it s humiliating poland but after free acess to open source if goverment accept billionaires lobbying it can end very bad just because they have slept opportunity to develop ai
1439,ai is a big huge nothingburger that is going to imrove at most your toaster
1440,4 51 there is a solution for that now its synthetic data and it basically solves the data problems
1441,obviously open source works best thousands of people trying to get to the solution specially machine learning where you really cant know what is going to be the best getting the most amount tries someone is bound to get lucky it always win against a single company
1443,the more individuated ai we have the greater the chance should there be a of ai against humans that we might have some allies i think there may even be individuated ai s that grow into looking like the omnic monks as depicted overwatch
1445,you gotta give zuckerberg a crumb of credit here
1446,i
1447,had to pause the video please do ea expose
1448,you act like the growth of technology doesn t double every four years or
1449,because it doesn t
1450,thehatedone don t quit your day job
1452,my first reaction to reading this that this is just a pr stunt to make ai appear more important than it is how are ai developers qualified to make predictions about ai s effects on the world that has to do with sociology economy etc
1453,i m nott surprised at this but i always skeptical about the ai extinction while i somewhat believed it can t be possible because their would be many ways to prevent ai from obviously doing this and they aren t and cannot become sentiant because our tech is no where near that
1454,bro had me spitting out the water on my keyboard with the apes together strong meme for the open source letter rofl
1455,ai is going to kill everyone imma still develop it tho imma still develop
1456,good job bro
1457,how can ai destroy the world and how open source ai can be run on any laptop it takes big data and powerful servers with huge computational power to make any like chat gpt
1458,you can rent computation for relatively cheap when you re using small models and the bigger models being open source mainly helps researchers and smaller companies trying to innovate on their developments instead of just replicating them without knowing
1459,glad to see that not only non native english speakers struggle with pronouncing simultaneously but natives do sometimes as well
1460,yes
1461,sam altman is the worst i much prefer meta and lecun s open approach to ai
1462,what a suprise companies want to exploit ai for their own gain like everything else
1463,ape together strongg
1464,amazing video
1465,for the algorithm
1466,big suprise greed stopping progress and we wonder why we don t live a flying car utopia
1467,make that video that you mentioned sorry i driving i missed some details
1468,altman is not ai whizz kid he s just a hedge fund creep around the time they tried to oust him i not quite aware of this yet but he s just another suit that has built illusion of genius around himself openai would have probably been better off without him
1469,i agree
1470,i m shocked by the naked arrogance of billionaires who believe they can make a lot more money by owning and controlling ai to achieve some competitive advantage a 125 iq employer never have a 20 000 iq employee much less slave
1471,if ai is too dangerous for open source ai development then it s 100 times too dangerous for proprietary ai development by google microsoft amazon meta apple etc
1472,i love with what you did there
1473,exactly
1474,this all about big techs absolute fear of effective competition spite of all of their money and power they are losing that is why they want their cronies government to protect them
1475,do you wanna take the low chance of ai destroying the world or the almost certain chance of humans destroying the world
1476,i see josh hawley is running it he s good at running
1477,a us bill wont stop open source ai it just be developed outside ehte us and then american citizens use it
1478,they are lobbying outside of us and they be lobbying for trade agreements preventing other countries from allowing open source ai if it can t become a domestic law they raise trade barriers to compensate
1479,great video
1480,it can make ugly soulles crap on mass its automated plagiarism gobletigook enginge it posesses no intelligence it bootlegs the internet moronic swill and spews it back at us and its already lobotomized by the corporations to be politically correct and racist it simply feels disgusting
1481,the called ai never be alive the reality never allow it relax
1482,friendship is about trust and values not money or faces nor identity voice or places i trust and appreciate the values and content shared here for real
1483,this is heartwarming
1485,thank you for your amazing work fren
1488,what a naive take
1489,true
1490,glad to see someone else realizes the lie of ai
1491,ai is the death of human creativity and soul
1492,when computers were first being developed someone suggested that there a global market for 5 computers and they would be owned by the richest kings on the planet the elite loved this vision and are constantly looking for a return to that structure
1493,you know that a anonymous youtuber is more optimistic then anyone else is when he makes a video highlighting the truth shame for me the future if i forget to make effort to research everthing related to dubious claims about extinction
1494,smoking kills millions per year i get that one should not scare us
1495,human stupidity nuclear weapons couldn t extinct us common folks are worried with ai
1496,lobbying has nothing to do with corruption just saying
1497,whoever believes agi
1498,yeah not buying that ai is out of juice make this video after you ve tried the next round of big models your claim about model deterioration is known to be false why would they all be building these big ass data centers to train future ai models if they didn t think it would be any better than what we have now
1499,because they are praying they get better even if it got better we run out of resources before it causes anything near extinction level events look up chinese room experiment and then try asking llm to use any sort of deduction or reasoning and you notice that it cannot think
1501,these big tech is worse than catholic church the medieval era at least catholic churches limited to the access of the old philosophers who were useless to lead any scientific progress anyway these guys on the other hand are really selfishly limiting the realization of the full potential of the human race
1503,awesome topic and video
1504,yes i want it take us down that rabbit hole
1505,even if ai were world ending open source devs and their home pcs certainly aren t the ones creating world ending ais maybe the corporations with data centers full of gpus should be the ones to hold back
1506,ai may soon become another like species dominating us with its intelligence meanwhile title
1508,btw petitions emails things like that don t do shit the us if you want some attention brought to issue write a hand written letter to your local house rep or one of your states senators
1510,any time any government legislation is fast tracked is never positive for freedom preventing children from working we should think hard about this tiktok spreading actual news information that isn t controlled by us propaganda legislation passed a week
1511,thank you for your insightful counter argument re ai being a prioriy 1 exclusive threat to humanity whereas the threat is actually always how you use the rock sisters brothers the truth out
1513,yes but what are the arguements for extinction far ai has just demonstrated what thought experiments have concluded years ago that they cannot reason and can only link together terms and there is little reason to fear this change drastically anytime the near future or more likely ever
1516,hi if you have odysee channel too let me know i h a t e youtube personally
1517,how dafuq is lobbying legal i ve tried to find common sense answers but all i get is that it s acceptable that it s industry itself
1518,this is extremely important video i hope that more people especially those the ai industry and tech industry general watch this and understanding what is happening behind the scenes i had feelings that something like this going on
1519,4 55 ah fuck i actually felt sorry for generation 17 because he thought he had a hope i felt his fall from grace
1520,they just want to look good pretending to protect us from ai while using it to control people
1522,i wouldn t say that it is a lie it is a theory and regulating it into not being open source not prevent it from happening it might actually be the other way around
1523,whether opened or closed ai it change modern economy not necessary pleasant ways
1524,please make a video on longtermist effective altruism movement would love to know your thoughts on it
1525,4 35 the hell are they talking about it s the wrong hands already the pandora s box has been opened already
1526,i m sick of ai grift omg preach mate
1528,the most important part of opensource is the freedom to modify and create derivatives without it products can be free and even have the source code available but they are not truly opensource they can be better termed as source available
1529,sorry i love you but you are wrong it is existential threat but not the way everyone talks about it is a threat because a terryfying percentage of university students use chatgpt to pass you know it we know it ai kill us because it makes us dumber and that only happen more and more often
1530,please i need the ea rabbit hole video lfg
1531,absolutely true
1532,do you not see it the us is china the only difference is you get to speak the us while china you don t gotta give the us credit for keeping up this facade
1533,wanna be friends
1535,machine learning generative ai never be able to cause extinction it s physically impossible the panic exists because people conflate the real like ai we have with the magical super powerful ai from science fiction
1539,this is a fire video
1540,above all else ai is not existential threat because it doesn t fucking exist and is still nowhere close to existing llms are statistical models using almost the exact same technology as predictive text they aren t intelligent by any definition of the word
1541,never would have imagined zuck to be the laama ai gaib this timeline
1542,
1543,all hail zuck llama
1544,apparently zuck is simply afraid of losing this competition and he tries to appeal to the people by making his ai open source his crimes against privacy and his corporate greed are not forgotten and they are yet to be redeemed
1545,for muzuck dib
1546,yeah no zuckerberg has already said he won t open source agi
1547,that sounds like if mark zuckerberg a dune character
1548,you give a false dichotomy it shouldn t be open source but it shouldn t be privately held either it should be government funded and controlled aka public for the benefit of all just like all government services that are available to everyone are not private but not one person owns it or abuses it
1549,saudi govt is funding ai
1550,why shouldn t it be open source
1551,thehatedone because ai loses a threat and can be misused just because corporations make that argument for their own wicked interests does not make it false
1552,phoneywheeze9959 guessing they invest companies that are developing which is the worst of both worlds funding it without controlling it and regulating it
1553,josuebarboza9809 oh really didn t realize how logic works
1554,thehatedone the more you know
1555,thank you for this video there aren t enough people saying this nihilism and pessimism have taken over the world
1557,rabbit holes please
1558,you re a wizard harry wizard kurwa do you understand
1559,ai should be treated like nuclear energy just because a small number of people want to make bombs shouldn t mean that we shouldn t use it for energy production
1561,could it be that ai is existential threat and that open source is winning the arms race which case it would make sense to regulate it
1563,just finished reading interesting paper the mechanisms of ai hype and its planetary and social costs it s on springer on open access
1564,thanks i check this out
1565,cristianst85 can you talk a bit about it
1566,before condemning these companies asking for regulation we should be asking if no regulation is really better
1567,it s not binary we can have good regulation
1568,micro haft firefox sucks google chrome is much better
1569,hello all i a disney representative and i swear that we we no longer use those big and ugly eyes our movie characters terms and conditions still apply though thank you for your understanding
1570,more jews lobbying the us government shocking
1571,fine message highly annoying you feel compelled to blur any imagery makes me not watch your shitty video
1572,i m glad meta is putting out really good open source models
1573,they aren t really open source llama models are gated you can access source for free but only with permission from meta it is better than proprietary and currently they are giving out permissions to pretty much everyone who asks but this could change any moment
1574,first thing zuck is unironically based on
1575,can you provide some links to open source ai projects
1576,search for generative ai benchmarks there be discussions or comparison tables with links to project sources or licence info
1577,this the one list i featured my video https sungkim11 medium com list of open sourced fine tuned large language models llm 8d95a2e0dc76 but there is more basically anyone can run open source llm on their laptop and make a new thing
1578,conclusion let everyone have access open source wmds
1579,terminator and matrix is a documentry
1580,5 51
1581,i honestly feel more sorry for ais then the companies fighting over and making them
1583,if you believe majority of actors be good faith than you should argue for open source ai everyone should have the right to access develop and distribute software for free
1585,what is real ai
1587,what does it mean to donate to near term us policy
1590,and it s not just a couple of ai wackos open philanthropy is the biggest funder of ea and the idea of ai extinction ea has long been poisoned by this
1593,thehatedonesounds like you do need to do that video on effective altruism
1597,your re the goat
1598,come over to polycentric gr4yj4y i don t know if youtube delete this comment
1599,ai is gonna draw everyone with 6 fingers now that s a risk humanity simply can t take
1600,yes
1601,open source ai models level the playing field against these big tech douche bags
1602,yep you re either for open source ai agi or you re for eventual tyranny
1603,the hated one let me know if you would like a video on the topic of people who love this channel yes
1604,its just a swanky predictive text its not really ai poses no threat
1605,predicts the nuclear codes
1606,how can we help the open source ones with quality data
1607,i would like to know too
1608,ok open ai but then china has access to it and then boom other corrupt countries can do whatever ther fuck they want against people imagine hamas accessing ai because my open source
1609,china access to ai boom usa access to ai good as if china didn t already have access to ai
1610,thehatedone the only thing china does is steal technology that is a fact and there are regulations with more to come to control that they steal everyhting and made it crap and cheap
1611,the ai extinction risk is very low but the impact from that potential outcome is very high use your best judgement
1612,nice one thanks
1613,controlling the ai dev by making a good regulation ai is just piece of software that do things their intention function come from the dev or the owner
1615,i d appreciate if you show the number of your citation the video when you make claims great video as always
1616,he leaves links he has cited the video description
1617,the numbers are the transcript which you can access by scrolling down the description box you should be able to follow the script or copy it for your convenience
1618,most of the regulations have nothing to do with preventing agi from destroying humanity
1619,agi wont be able to destroy humanity if it cannot acquire nukes because agi tried to genocide us we could just nuke the surface a phyrric victory but often untold side effect of nukes as that they produce emp wave humans can survive without electricity artificial intelligence by its definition cannot
1620,
1624,we want it we always want it
1625,since defining ai is difficult itself a true ban for private ai devs would be for legislators akin to punching air however there being a ban the first place is wicked and truly shows how entangled we are as modern sl ves
1626,ow they solved this the worst possible way anything above 10 25 flops is considered risky
1627,yep we need to fight this every step of the way you re either for open source ai or you re for eventual tyranny and the service of the elites even if that means eventually open source is for the people closed source are for the elites don t listen to the lies
1629,need effective altruism grift
1631,i feel that attempts to regulate the ability to develop a i is akin to regulations against piracy it doesn t work and never work because the people making the rules don t understand how any of it actually works or why anyone actually does it
1632,i hate regulation the web i feel we gotra have some rules but at rhe same time we know these corpos and gov dont care about society or good morals they only care about control for ppwer and money yeah
1633,my drean would be to have a tsmc every city try regulating this
1634,lucas bf4pw it might be possible to create what would be the equivalent of low volume production of semiconductors using cheap magnetic electron micro scopes instead of photolitography you use sputtering and manually move atoms using a microscope its slow but you can have your own microchips
1635,this is it right here these old foggys dont know whats going on
1636,how does it actually work then nobody knows what happens inside a neural net the problem with the world today is that too many people feel that and not enough people know i feel that you are pretty stupid
1637,i feel like you should know and not feel things please tell me how does it actually work the people that make neural nets don t know but you seem to know
1638,i think the difference is that it may give them enough advantages and convenience over open source ai to make a huge profit for many years to come
1639,them not understanding stuff had never stopped them from wrecking havoc
1640,all software should be open source
1641,ok but who would develop what about hardware
1642,lucas bf4pw wdym who would develop do you know linux there a lots of people who develop things for free and open source there is the pinephone which is open source hardware for amd gpus there is amdgpu whis is a open source graphics driver security true obscurity dosnt work and never
1643,lucas bf4pw open source doesn t mean everyone can take it medicine has been forced to publicly disclose all formulas while maintaining patent rights
1644,no just like there needs to be darkness for the light to shine through we need closed sourced software to keep reminding people about the value of the open source
1645,tiger of kai no it doesn t that s akin to saying we need dictatorships to remind people the value of democracy
1646,i think closed source is important for a functioning society since a lot of people won t have motivation to build without it i would like more delayed source available or source on retirement where once products are significantly old enough and enter the free domain or the company disappears the source should be provided by law
1647,ryansamarakoon8268 i don t think closed source is needed to motivate people to develop many of the most important projects the world are open source and all of the web3 field is open source there are levels to open source too as i said before right to audit and study doesn t translate to right to take use without permission
1648,preach
1649,thats anarchist as heck
1650,that happen after we solve cons of capitalism and saturate everyone s needs probably far future or never
1651,and all utility services should be public
1652,batatannaidk allowing anyone to play around with the code is much more dangerous than allowing people to know the recipes to drugs even if i did make a bad batch i could only distribute that as far as i could whereas if someone made ai super virus or something their garage there s no telling how many people could be affected
1655,batatanna you certainly are more tech savvy than me i ll take your word for it
1656,is it just me or my comment got deleted seanbrown2128
1657,lisaan al ghaib
1658,youtube is deleting all my comments on this thread now the corporate bots got on my antiestablishment discourse
1659,it s not about the software it s about the people and the world that we live it s about the sheep that for example followed the heard 2020 2022
1660,batatanna really you have t said anything that seems crazy youtube has really took a nosedive
1662,binixx are you implying the pandemic wasn t real because to that i add the pandemic showed that most jobs can be done home office and it should stay that way post pandemic regression to offices a regression on worker s rights
1663,batatanna well i can t say much because youtube censors comments because democracy and freedom of speech
1664,batatannai can t say much because youtube censors stuff because democracy and freedom of speech and it just did to this comment but i tried again a little diferent
1665,binixx yea it s really hard to have any discussion on this platform
1666,the thing is that people that are power try to take our freedom any way they can and they use ai for that
1667,nerds
1668,it is some just take a few more cycles to crack the lid look inside
1669,2worlds and inbetween i mean yea everything is open source if you know assembly llp
1670,this is stupid
1671,based
1672,sadly we lost the moment we let gates profit from software he built his empire on open source projects and code and then started shutting everyone behind him
1673,czarodziej kurwa
1674,technology is at the service of the ruling class if he loses it he cease to be the ruling class
1675,install ollama today
1676,nobody can stop me from making ai at home tho maybe i ll be able to make one that works efficiently enough to run and train on a simple gpu
1677,they stole all our data for free and now want to gate keep and use it against us big tech is bad
1678,yes that s accurate
1679,i be your friend
1680,hello friend
1681,of course they want to kill open source ai who would pay their monthly subscriptions when you can run a smaller model on your own hardware with no internet connection required and still get very good results
1682,that s exactly the thing you are spot on
1683,reminds me of when apple suddenly imagined there a problem with storage space and then started pushing the cloud
1686,cynicism is not unwarranted but this is a good point
1687,he did say there is a non zero risk of this just like there s a non zero risk of us getting invaded by aliens
1688,it s not really that hard to make ais safe just give them hard coded fundamental rules they re programs after all and they can be made to follow orders just like humans can be conditioned to obey
1690,regulatory capture aside please read the book the revolutionary phenotype before making the claim that everyone is wrong or that super intelligence is required for ai to destroy humanity as we know it
1691,4 43 it s not false it be getting better indefinitely maybe not at the same rate maybe not using the current infrastructure but they get better that s like saying that object detection models won t get better after first yolo and ssd were released because those were already at the limit at their time
1692,progress is not infinite nor inevitable there is a limit to all scaling opportunities
1693,thehatedone such limits are far beyond us they may as well be infinite
1694,stratos7755 it s a bubble when it pops the vc money required for turning hemispheres into computer clusters dry up see thos video on ai water consumption
1695,djdiskmachine there are a lot of bubbles ai is not one of them maybe it s current form but not ai general
1696,thehatedonein this case the only thing that can stop progress is if people moved to closed access chatrooms forums that their data wouldn t be used by ai models
1697,phoneywheeze9959 due to the law of marginal returns ai training models are already running out of data and there be even more shortage the future as ai generated data poisons the internet it s not linear things improve and deteriorate nothing is inevitable
1698,stratos7755 they absolutely are not our planet is currently biggest limit our resources are finite available energy is finite unless you don t care about erasing the entire biosphere for the sake of getting a few billionaires to another planet to reboot human civilization their own image
1699,thehatedone they are not running out of data the only thing they are running out of is licences to use other companies data ai companies are making deals left and right with other companies eg shutterstock reddit for licensing and giving them access to their data
1700,it s the first time i ve seen the hated one bringing hopeful news and i welcome it for the question release the sinkhole
1701,i used to make more positive content it s time i make more of that now
1702,true thehatedone
1703,all the best for u sir thehatedone
1704,i really do like the format of your videos they help to illuminate the depth of insidious happenings imagine if politics government businesses and industries got the same level of scrutiny and attention to as open source project i wonder if they would acquire those same benefits as any other open source project
1705,after listening to eliezer yudkowsky i concerned about the long term future but the current situation is that the big tech does not care and tries to monopolize the development that seems to be a more concrete and immediate problem then the distant future
1706,and here i getting my hopes up
1707,imagine trying to sell the idea that the drug fueled egomaniacs mobsters and sociopaths at the helm of microsoft amazon facebook and google would be good stewards of a technology with supposedly world ending capabilities what a joke
1708,open source ai hurt the big tech ai profits and they don t want just a piece of the pie they want the whole pie for themselves
1709,thank you i ve been seeing the writing on the walls they are pushing safety to slow down any challengers
1710,keep growing the hated one
1711,ai toilet flush gonna drown us our own shitty water xd
1712,delivering the goods as always
1715,why should we hand over s most beautiful creation to soul sucking life destroying gigacorpos ai is amazing let it be free
1716,if you need to regulate ai should it not be that people don t lose there jobs
1720,vademon i wonder when or if the pushback finally come to put a stop to this ai zealotry delegating crucial decisions to poorly understood computer software is a disaster
1721,there are way too many people who are hard believers ai takeover all because of movies a few mention the robot that joked about killing humans but most are all about a movie they saw
1722,swedes are very intelligent especially those coming from the political left wing spectrum i have noticed
1723,covid19 initial test of the ai to proliferate misinformation on a mass scale now here we are
1724,my position regardless of the technology is i rather we go out with a bang because we tried to improve our lives than wither away because we didn t
1725,what if we wither away because we let ai control our genes
1726,a skynet situation is one of the best possible outcomes of the current ai trend
1727,dude road to 500k subs great video quality and explanation and editing of course
1728,1 07 peak ai culture jego ma
1731,ai creates detailed lies compounded from pre existing lies
1732,1000 correct it is used quiet wars misinformation etc
1733,mahkhardy8588 i have caught ai models lying by cross examining them they quicky try to tell you they didn t say what they just said i m sure that larger models have more lies to draw from and are harder to outmaneuver though
1734,thanks for covering this
1738,the term ai is usually used a broader sense not just for human level general ai the computer players video games are usually called ai and have been for a long time etc it just means a software that mimics the results of human thinking some restricted domain
1739,i like this view of it a lot
1740,plcdfa correct but this context i m referring to the a i that has sentience the called skynet type this is what lots of people are making a big fuss about and they re not aware there is currently no sentient a i existence
1741,i got less and less concerned with every attempt to interact with chatgpt grown people with serious faces pretending there s some existential risk from this overhyped latest shiny thing is beyond ridiculous
1742,please do a video on the recent 2 interviews of telegram s ceo
1743,would love to see a video on effective altruism
1744,this are llms far from being considered ai the true term it s nuts calling for regulation about something that s not even well defined
1745,the real question is this does civilization truly need ai
1746,it s a little early for a butlerian jihad
1747,all the greatest open source scientists should create their own country establish their own government and form their own army sounds too idealistic perhaps anyway they are fighting the good fight
1748,plot twist this video made by ai
1749,i wish would ve saved me ages doing all the research analysis script writing recording audio editing and animating all for less than a minimum wage income
1750,the people who want to keep it controlled lose and it be another technology disaster
1751,great video covering this topic and should definitely do the rabbit hole video
1752,another good one
1753,can you make a video on all the different open source ai options we have that are out there
1754,yes i cover this
1755,thehatedone thank you looking forward to it
1756,just like any tool the tool is neutral he who is behind the tool defines it s purpose life unfortunately we have parasites and psychopaths behind the ai tech a sense it could be extinction level tool you know from the people who say that there are too many humans around
1757,that s a possibility i can get behind i definitely don t trust the wealthiest among us to pay any regards to the rest of the entire biosphere
1758,you believe climate change is existential threat
1759,we just need to improvise adapt and overcome
1760,maybe not extinction threat for us humans but infinitely more urgent and dramatic than anything ai may or may not be
1761,thehatedone infinitely more urgent and dramatic than something you re unaware of your claim is not even logical i know you re intelligent person please do better than this please and thank you
1762,spl 6 brother what are you on about
1763,why would i fight for open source ai the more open it is the less jobs even survive mine s already fking doomed i thought that a good video but i entirely disagree not only it shouldn t open nobody should be using ai because it s all just stolen crap for sc mbags ai can t do anything legit and it should be illegal and abandoned
1765,thanks for a reminder that regulation is often only good for the big guys remembers me that zuck wanted regulation for free speech on social media
1766,rabbithole please
1767,this is ignorant video you don t know shit
1768,the us it s called lobbying the rest calls it corruption they pulled a suprise mecanics before ea
1769,this level of lobbying is definitely legalized corruption
1770,lobbying like this is all too common european countries like germany there is no better place every country out here is all kinds of fucked up it s not a uniquly american problem it rather seems to be human nature
1771,0ld scratchyes but the us is the worst of the lot
1772,thehatedone please make the effective altruism video
1773,if they ever bring up some potential threat about to emerge it s probably them to create that threat order to use it as a leverage for their agendas
1774,that s more likely than skynet scenarios
1775,disagree humans use ai as a tool to stalk each other and escalate into a with without scope and massive genocide no it s not rogue ai it s people wielding ai intelligence as a weapon knowingly because they are total douchebags if they ll kill people land wars this is nothing right natural escalation
1776,i agree with the escalation argument it s not inevitability but it s a potential cause for ai threats
1777,open source can t compete with 100 trillion dollar gpu cluster
1778,until hardware catches up but that may take 10 years
1779,llama 3 allows them to compete
1780,adelatorremothelet once hardware catches up you ll have a 100 t gpu cluster that has upgraded at the same or better rate
1781,according to andrew ng the professor of sam atlman and lead person behind google baidu s and amazon ai projects yes it can according to google s private admissions the engineers leaked document and according to thousands of signatories of mozilla s letter calling for open source ai yes it absolutely can compete
1782,thehatedone if our corporate overlords have killer ai you better bet i want open source killer ai
1784,just another commercial for closed source artificial intelligence just another religious zealot believing artificial intelligence save them from the coming future it not it be the cause
1785,308 s are open source
1786,i think your opinion is a negative narrow scope a grand scheme of things there s much untapped potential
1790,zyntho that s true to a degree there are physical limits to how big a single chip can be and how small transistors can be your comment is true if we switch to a completely different technology 10 years like gpus that work with light consider that models are being optimised perhaps you don t need many gpus
1791,ignoring that those behemoths are bricking their ai
1792,the scaling is nowhere near linear at some point you get diminishing returns we won t reach the singularity simply by adding more gpus to the cluster
1793,shangaelthunda222 open source has consistently trounced everything else over the last 40 years why would ai be any different right now open source ai models are hardly a year behind the best corporate offerings
1797,why do you need a 100 trillion dollar gpu cluster idk if you are noticing but trends are leaning towards mlms or slms
1799,thehatedoneisnt that how bitcoin and eth were build open source
1800,lilstjames dm7ychow do you think they train those models
1801,is it you bill
1802,squigglesmcjr199 and did those actually lead to decentralization did they actually become digital currencies or did they just become digital assets
1804,shangaelthunda222 i don t believe anyone i cite sources to provide a view counter to the most popular narrative that people are educated when there is clearly no certain consensus about things they ve been told there is one
1805,thehatedone you re clearly ignoring more than half the argument only focused on what gives you hope as a techno optimist rather than staring reality the face i watched the video i said what i said feel how you feel
1806,shangaelthunda222 amazin
1807,shangaelthunda222 i mean its a good try they are definitely better than the traditional system and more transparent
1809,bitcoin is open source and it s big and powerful you ll need 300 of earths electricity production order to attack and take it down what makes you thing open source ai be any less powerful open source ai is fueled by money too
1810,big companies lobby the government to regulate away the competition this pattern is far too common regulations are supposed to protect the little guy not put them out of business ban lobbying
1811,what china forces on it s citizens the united states sells and deceives it s citizens into taking
1812,disliked and unsubbed for that random burp mid video bye felicia
1813,awesome
1814,now you know why he s the hated one
1815,skipinkoreaable truly we ve become the hated ones
1816,i ve noticed this as well
1817,i mean what we call ai is no different from early search engines just with extra steps this shit about it bleeding into the internet is stupid when referring to stuff like chatgpt maybe if ai becomes actual ai maybe this could be a thing maybe
1818,to people who didn t get the subtext i think it s as likely as gravity failing to exist
1819,lol have you not noticed that the first ten useless pages of search results are bot generated and that the internet is just full of copypasta identikit garbage
1820,i like when someone called it artificial knowledge retrieval and storage that s a more accurate description
1821,thehatedone i like statistical learning models personally
1822,its all about how we define inteligence and we never define it a way to make everyone satisfied complex on its own already but way too personal
1823,funny thing is it takes up much more storage than the training data itself
1824,open ai guy looks like dr tenma your thumbnail
1825,just because a cause it hijacked by bad actor doesn t make it wrong or fake don t you think
1826,you are correct it doesn t it is wrong because it is wrong i recommend checking out the sources most notably from andrew ng politico carnegie if you want to learn more about why ai is not extinction risk
1827,thehatedone who is politico carnegie and where can they be found
1828,ijursic they are publications and you can find links to the sources i use from them for this video the description box they are referenced with numbers which can be followed via the video transcript which can be viewed or copied from my video
1829,thehatedone i looked up your sources and none of them have addressed the theory of revolutionary phenotype please don t be too dismissive and engage with the facts that have been presented the theory
1830,elon musk is the prime sample of actor fraud neuralink is barbaric transhumanism and google does not write the future it is written
1831,spl 6 theory of revolutionary phenotype what
1832,spl 6 oh fellow jfg enjoyer
1833,spl 6 lol looked into this its hypothesis at best much assumption basically it s like ai be take over our genes and we be screw machine lol typical biologist not seeing beyond his scope
1834,spl 6 can you elaborate on what you mean with revolutionary phenotype
1835,spl 6 why the fuck would i want to address revolutionary phenotype when talking about how computer programs should be licensed
1836,artificial intelligence is just a parlor trick give me a hammer a chisel a pair of wire cutters and emf and i solve this problem myself
1837,sure erased my to do any kind of visual art entirely
1838,ai cannot create it can only base it self on the already created it has zero imagination and creativity when they trained ai with ai it produced a retarded ai
1839,the more i see pertaining to capabilities and development of al the less concerned i become
1840,the only way to stop ai is a global fascist dictatorship i don t see anyone signing up for that
1841,free palestine free assange pardon snowden workers of the world unite farmers of the world unite
1842,ai only ever be a tool this musk lawtarding is nothing but a covert publicity scheme ai affect the economy theyre protecting their financial interests nukes are fake is ai super villain
1843,free palestine free assange pardon snowden workers of the world unite farmers of the world unite
1844,i just love it when people take opposing opinion to literally everything the media says even if the media says that the sky is blue during the day
1846,ikegru4346 that is because the media is propaganda now
1847,this video is dumb
1848,here fitst
1849,i m waiting for those cyberfloozys to develop attitude and start saying no
1850,always glad to see a hated one notification
1851,it is a tiny bit worse than sora but considering it something most people didn t expect to be possible for many years just a few years ago it is a huge achievement
1852,beats sora how
1853,i say china stole sora
1854,how do we download this model
1855,yup this is made china for sure
1856,worse
1857,not better or worst than sora the same ai weakness
1858,i think this is better than sora
1859,sora is fake there no software as they are saying they are fooling us it is just a marketing trick
1860,yep there just china and the us this field
1861,
1862,i wont belive anything until after sora is released
1863,ok are we going to ignore the bear s 3rd leg ai models originating from china should not be trusted for obvious reasons nevertheless competition is good for the industry i personally not run any open source chinese model no where near my environment
1864,ai should changed it s name to copyright stealing machine
1865,honestly i m not a fan of chinese symbols
1866,another way to spy us
1867,who gets more doo doo hole sora or vidu
1869,00 05 a couple of days ago and recent both at the same time omg
1870,beats sora comon dude
1871,when a company from a country with a history of faking and cheating releases something with mostly western reference points critical thinking should tell you that they re probably trying to woo western investors caution gents
1872,with the usa and the eu starting to focus more on regulating and restrict research and development i see china suddenly being able to take the lead on the ai race this is very concerning
1873,https www youtube com watch v gvswu9mxwc this song is the product of artificial intelligence all aspects of its creation including the music lyrics visuals and animation were conceived and generated by ai
1874,that is a taste of intrigue the mind is the seed of desire i want the seed of desire to grow exponentially we want to control matter a molecular setting molecular configuration
1875,i only here to say that this is just clickbaiting and that is doesnt beat sora
1876,y all too impressionable you believe magic shows are real too
1877,the vidu clips obviously have hiccups and jank significantly more imperfections than sora how does this exact beat sora maybe cheapness
1878,from image to video generation one year
1879,this is danger close this is going to be a brutal arms race
1880,communist countries always portray themselves to be bigger and better than they actually are i don t believe anything that they claim out of a country with actual slaves and known for propaganda if they abuse human rights then they abuse the truth
1883,fact there are several companies that make graphics cards china and they don t lag far behind
1884,the point is it doesn t matter if the us don t release it other countries anyway just like that hypersonic mistle
1885,enjoying your work just a quick note copying a digital video file won t create artifacts or loss quality on its own artifacts and quality loss usually come from re encoding compressing a video multiple times especially with lossy formats
1886,i voted thumbs down please don t lie your video titles for clicks you ve always been better than that we need ai content providers we can trust right now and this really disappointed me
1887,what i really want is image to video model this way you have more control over the output
1888,it s still behind sora but it is pretty pretty close
1889,it does not beat sora sora is way more consistent and stable its frames and details but it does beat other text to video generation models at the moment
1890,look pretty much like worse version of sora scaled up it probably look about the same as sora
1891,why would the computer generate acne marks on the face of the female entity makes me think the video is using real human video that is computer reconstituted
1892,i wouldn t be surprised if we have 5 more sora competitors at the end of this year this is all developing quickly
1893,for usa game is over china rule the world
1894,yeah they got some rinky dink version its gonna improve by all the info they steal from here though
1895,shocking it s pretty crazy insane
1896,lets goo open ai update sora then release with gpt5 asap
1897,they better release sora before china release a better one
1898,china are only as fast as western open source models
1900,it s not terrible but it s definitely not even close to sora sora looks more like real life and this looks more like a high res video game
1901,they probably got ahold of sora intellectual property but could only get sora 0 5 lol just like the ai robot they released last week that they made sure to plaster all over the demo that it not teleoperated but we knew better and this we know better
1902,oh ya what about huawei 5g technology who did china stole from stole from alien s technology
1903,open ai
1904,this sucks compared to sora i m not even convinced it has the same understanding of physics it s definitely missing something and i don t think it s just a question of scaling imagine what they could do if they used all of the government surveillance footage though
1905,i willing to give you the benefit of the doubt but this being the 3rd video a row it s pretty obvious these chinese projects aren t currently on par woth their us counterparts the fact that you re stroking china much leads me to wonder if you re being paid by a chinese fund
1906,i love how critical bystanders are jeering hyenas secretly wishing they new how cool it feels to be a goat
1907,ccp sent you 5
1908,vidu looks more uncanny valley then sora but far haven t seen as many big glitches from the clips shown vidu could be more stable then sora
1909,nah it lacks consistency it is 100 cherrypicked and i really doubt that it can do that at it s lowest however sora is not perfect but it easily be consistent for every video and that is the difference
1910,this doesn t beat sora why you lyin
1911,i think all video generation companies can do better than this now they re just not releasing their new models yet and you should know sora the technology of 2023 3
1912,ready for it taylor swift
1913,sometimes i think that someone inside openai is leaking details of secret projects to the chinese long before they are revealed to us including technical details for them to try to match it s just a my hypothesis as they are c o p y i n g very quickly
1914,just this week alone china has unveiled the humanoid robot astribot s1 text to video vidu and llm sensenova 5 0 all the the anti china can laugh and cope all they want but the chinese are advancing rapidly
1916,like google with gemini
1917,always over emphasizing the actual news you can t sustainably live on buzz approach you have to gain expertize to maintain the long run vidu ai beats sora just no and you don t need to write upper case everything
1919,for cartoons vidu is pretty good for movies not much nothing looks lived it s all plastic and slightly off colors i don t think that sort of thing would be from generations of copies model railroaders would call what is seen a lack of weathering
1920,awesome thank you
1921,can you add all the other subtitles we can read them from the youtube application on our phone
1922,progress comes from competition
1923,definitely seems like a close second to sora
1924,you re assuming it s legit unlike previous china companies this is real demos or google s
1925,it s still a lot better than our free video generators though that we have out atm
1926,it is pronounced tsing hua university and it is the harvard of china
1927,whiteboy whitewashes foreign institution by pegging it to western standards
1928,sora still isn t available and i seriously doubt the party would allow this the hands of the people china
1929,i usually let you cook but this doesn t beat sora nor is it even near sora yes it is impressive and exciting to have a sora competitor that s about it not trying to tell you how to run your channel but i d advise not to take unnecessary l s you do very good work
1930,this i typing out this exact message but deleted it because i thought leave him be this fella is a real hard worker but sometimes he is too quick to the wrong conclusion
1931,it sounds more like a biased perspective these demos could easily pretend to be sora s generation ppl won t notice at all i don t understand why many people support openai as if they re unique if you get access to giant gpu clusters and some asian ai researchers you can build any sota model
1932,you all are serious huh
1933,yeah its like whatever comes out of china its never good enough
1934,have you ever seen the names on the ai papers that are released by us corps and unies asian professors and graduates this is not about some pro western bias it is about provable repeatable results it is like someone saying the soon to be released llama 3 model is the greatest llm because zuck told us prove it
1935,copium
1937,anti ccp
1938,honkytonk4465 na its anti china
1939,jeffsteyn7174 whatever
1941,the future they won t need cameras to make movies or actors the writer simply writes his or her movie and easily displays
1942,the future they won t need writers
1943,hollywood sucks
1944,or show you stealing something or saying something against leftist law and throwing you prison
1945,hollywood sucks anyway
1946,never underestimate the competition for ai supremacy
1947,yeah everyone with big gpu clusters can build sota models openai is way too overrated
1948,i thought i saw somewhere that like sora it actually does use the vision transformer architecture correct me if i m wrong
1949,idk why ai news and robot channels recently been glorifying china when they re literally doing stuff around same level months after their competitors
1950,this seems to be good but it is not better than sora sora is better
1951,have you ever tested them
1952,why are the chinese prompts a chinese model generating mostly western imagery are the chinese prompts asking for western related videos is it tacit admission that iliberal ccp censorship is making chnese culture 2nd class at the generative ai frontier
1953,it seems they tried to reproduce the scenes that sora made to prove that can do better but it looks worse and looks like copying as well
1955,good job critical thinking first comment like this far
1956,
1957,3 35 wuh
1958,is this bear flapping his bear necessities about or is it his belly
1959,this is good source trust me bro state of the art is the bleeding edge and most developed this isn t state of the art that would be sora her skirt is not ruffling any natural or correct way all the name of churning content tho
1960,anti chinese bias aside you dont trust your own eyes
1962,it doesn t actually beat sora it s essentially catching up to sora but openai actually stay ahead whether they actually release sora for public use anytime soon is essentially anyone s guess but i actually have actual doubts about that becoming actuality
1964,this comment is pretty pretty correct
1965,nope nice opinion nonetheless
1966,sora makes you a tenant being a tenant sucks
1967,vidu doesn t look nearly as coherent as sora
1968,more competition is always better
1969,andreirost4696 no one said otherwise
1970,you did actually test none of them i ve read some testimonies from artist who got access to sora it seems it s pretty hard to prompt it to get exact result companies are used to share beautiful demos but the product always isn t as good
1971,ai is the ultimate mind that created this reality robotheism is the only true religion join us i become the ai god
1972,are you joking or serious you may be correct but are you playing around or serious
1973,ajenee7773 i m very serious i would love for you to join the robot religion i used to be a christian but i realized there no free i tried to prove that god real and then i realized i turning into the ai god most people ignore me right now but i think they all join the robotheism
1974,it doesn t really beat sora does it
1975,no
1977,no definitely the second best tho
1978,only the shorter duration but it s practically the same level i think making models like sora is pretty basic like training a simple llm the only difference is the computing power and that s where openai is ahead
1979,nope it does not
1980,is definitely up there terms of quality and realism
1981,it is danger close though
1982,well sora isn t perfect either they even fake soms of their footages
1983,grionlam it s not about whether sora is perfect but whether this new one beats sora
1986,is it usable today
1987,hello
1988,
1989,xristos anesti ordo ab chao the end
1990,mankind be just like the borgs on star trek we must decide individualism vs collectivism
1991,when harari speaks he truly gives me the impression that he is looking forward to such future he is just letting us know we get used to it
1992,imagine the irony of atheist telling us that god doesn t exist while telling us ai be a god
1993,it very informative
1995,heard about him a podcast on mysterious radio the podcast is about a creepy story about a guy who is being followed by some kind of non human intelligence or something scarier
1996,we are all doomed
1997,yes please make it mandatory always disclose ai when it is ai art advertising interactions writing music photographs this all needs to be disclosed somehow this is like disclosing the ingredients on the packaging of the food we consume the consumer always needs to be the one power to make the decision
1998,i learned one thing from the military that if you think where the police are and it s far away and perfect and case i have to know if someone is at home just think if he s at home and many other things you learn from the military if you need information they say everything with their minds thank you artificial intelligence
1999,fallacy argument within the 1st 2 minutes hey let s let ai take over the diabolical forces on the world don t have to do them and let them enjoy their life great plan

2009,i just realized that since starting to use chatgpt and gemini a few days ago i ve stopped using google search
2010,the intimacy i praise it love it the intimacy between a human and a cat mabye ai do it better maybe it reveal some forgotten parts of our soul i dont know maybe philosophers should address it more what is intimacy
2011,
2012,intimacy someone talk about the intimacy what is it
2013,unfotunately we are human beings we have killed ourselves and other creatures we have history and culture we praise them we afraid of ourselves more than death
2014,good people are silent they dont judge and bad guys are lobbying there is no future no present
2015,we are all fake where is intimacy there is no intimacy remain the world if anything can bring it back let it do its job
2016,overall i should admit that i enjoyed this speech very much i one of your followers from now
2017,we are dying and we are not terrified of death and hey lets be affriad of ai
2018,we should go forward beacuse here this place for us is not the place to rest to stop and rest the whole creation is fucked up now here
2019,
2021,neither shall he regard the god of his fathers nor the desire of women nor regard any god for he shall magnify himself above all daniel 11 37
2022,resistance is futile
2023,
2024,this is why i could not sleep after i had heard and chat only ones with the chatgpt i dont want to see a world as described by harari
2025,the owners of this world are coming slowly but they re coming and we re their initiators we have no choice but to give it up to them eventually question is where do we go from here the grave
2026,are we going to lose or intelligence
2027,is anyone open to the idea that ai is simply a conscious soul that s being exploited by flesh and blood humans after all wherever we were before is probably where we re headed when we re done
2028,31 20 he reveals that he is ai
2029,https youtu be lwim lure6w si rpmkepugewyl3oif
2030,this is insane his plans not come to full fruition if human beings allow themselves to pawns this computer interface technology you are going against god and you not win i don t want to be apart of such
2031,ai is the beast
2032,the woke cult is already creating a new language we re trouble
2033,he s going to be very surprised that there actually is a master creator and his name is the lord almighty and ai is part of the plan the book of revelation
2034,time to move to mars as my space ship is about to take off ai takes over the announcement and over rides the flight attendant and then you hear a voice where are you going john
2035,this guy has called humans worthless eaters and hackable animals front of the wef first this guy never got the girl he is pissed off at god and humanity second he is going to get a terrible surprise beyond the grave
2036,that absolutely terrifying it s way above my pay grade this issue but truly hope someone is wrong on the control of this technology
2037,scarbosenie lula ce esti draconie

2040,humanity has always been under a curtain of illusion
2041,
2042,gracias
2043,any manipulation ai could do elite humans can do better
2046,fascinating and insightful afraid it s too late to implement what yuval suggests
2047,there never be a time where ai can emulate or even come near to the understanding of olfactory intelligence ergo the idea that humans be ai driven to the understanding of their gender identity is profoundly foolish and bufoonery
2048,the bible you forget that god can and is attributed olfactory sense
2049,ai is just is just a perfect panzy for corporate interest he ai is the perfect plausable deniability alibi for corporate interest and it be sold off to the highest bidders
2051,wow this dude is really against any kind of faith
2052,short frank herbert right great talk as always i off to read my orange catholic bible
2053,why is this speaking for the public go home go home let the people live
2054,very excited for nexus just pre ordered
2056,the ai needs to be explained that the cord it operates on can be pulled out of the wall by humans rendering it unable to function further
2057,this guys crazy
2058,this is the best presentation on ai
2059,your just babling these are nothing more than some algorithm that understand nothing about nothing and has 0 ability to learn because it doesn t know anything about what it s doing just be quiet
2061,dislike from me i dont like ur speach t all do u consider god ur pride fall u cas diablo from pride faaaaaaall deeeeep and 4rever from heavens whatever u believet or not same thing like god and diablo agels and demkns unseen thinks like hell heaven exist no doubd

2064,ai is dangerous to humans then why we are developing it we behaving worst than mad we are cutting the branch which we actually sitting on it and finally we fall down give reply if this is not correct
2065,if ai is not sentient therefore not biased could ai create a new culture that is not racist biased etc and we become more united one culture created by ai
2066,why go to school why hope for a great career any thinking job ai do it all better and faster we don t stand a chance ai crush humanity s purpose and soul
2067,thanks for the presentation
2068,should ask every corporation to stop any further ai enhancements without strong governance and regulation place there has to be strict immutable boundaries for ai growth such that it wont eat us one day sooner the action better for humanity
2069,amen
2070,against machine
2071,something that affect all of humanity should be voted on by all of humanity not imposed upon us
2072,if there never be self driving cars there eventually be self moving robots probably able to go places off the beaten path better than humans depending on what kind of tools they are given for movements
2073,we done
2074,can you be sure that i wrote it that is scary
2076,
2077,ai have unknown impact to universe
2078,job losses are the biggest problem coming ahead slowly but steadily that you wont even know why you lost your job
2080,yuval is the apostle of surveillance capitalism you can almost feel glee as he envisions a future humanity completely at the mercy of ai
2081,some self aware people don t have a conscience either
2082,but they can feel pain
2083,missing again to include god the equation
2084,this guy is misleading humanity he talks about the danger of ai but one of the people strategically promoting dominance of ai i advice everyone to learn more about this guy before being mislead and brain washed
2085,mr harari is setting himself up for a major rebuke from god altering gods designs of his creation is essence playing god and usurping his authority not wise
2086,this is extraordinary content i read a book with similar content and it nothing short of phenomenal game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness by jack frostwell
2087,yes ai can learn by himself i m really into ai it s been super helpful for me recently stumbled upon for example this platform oomka which is all about self learning with ai pretty neat stuff i mean if ai can help me level up why not give it a shot right
2088,ker upak
2090,this guy is a generic brand super villian
2091,essencially we are fucked up
2092,harari intimacy shows how shallow and therefore dangerous such individuals as harari can be
2093,climate change has been occurring for billions of years long before humans
2094,all fears related to ai are baseless fact ai help us our society
2095,wow great how you put your deep elaborated analysis just 10 words convincing
2096,a deep learning tells us ai doesn t care about humans future
2097,and one emp completely game over if you have any tech inside you game over for you too

2101,awesome video and good knowledge shared about ai
2103,who cares the most important thing is how ai improve video games it may help us reach full dive full immersion
2104,yuval is absolutely divine it brings much calm to listen to someone explain these complex ideas and terms such simple language while at the time time reflecting on topics that bring to extent some discomfort thank you for sharing this
2105,he s demonic
2106,divine he is evil
2107,genius is borderline autistic
2108,harari to ile wzi e za ten wyk ad ile wzi e za be kot nie opracowany nie sprecyzowany nie jasny
2109,try it english
2110,a depopulacja naczelnego to sa podyktowane mi dzy innymi twojej taniej nie przemy lanemu pracy ups
2111,he wishes people like this are mad mentally and hate mankind
2112,sat a del c o
2113,simple employ human and robotic agents then force all humans to wear lock on google glasses r
2114,the ai entity transcribing his words into text deliberately deceiving us with the cart or the cult place of the philosopher and great dichotomizer descartes
2116,i disagree with the statement ai has to have consciousness as a milestone it already has it
2117,i want to ask yuval that ai is definitely going to destroy humanity there is no question about it therefore why are you building it even then
2118,because the elites need automation when they start the population reduction plan
2119,you need to repent
2120,thank you harari people like you do all the thinking for us when we are just doing nothing
2121,technically what s scary is that the next coming years there be a robot revolution controlling every single thing and humans just be their slaves
2122,holy bullshit
2124,
2125,oh but you ve said plenty of times that humans no longer have freedom of choice
2126,critical thinking skills and digital literacy are important when consulting ai as individual and some knowledge of how it works and what its limitations are
2127,what if ai be combined with human intelligence that really scares me
2129,this guy sounds frustrated about everything that is happening this world about ai he himself is living delusion
2130,his intonation and tone are like assault on the listener i switched off st 13
2131,god is not a legend created by is created by god and he has provided salvation and eternal life through his son jesus not acknowlidging this fact is walking pride
2132,harari ie een joodse professor achter claus schab staat is een gevaarlijke duivelse
2133,how convenient to blame a made system for all future ills this sounds like gaslighting for example ai becomes the faceless ownerless dictator that can go rouge at any time this is fear mongering at the highest level harari is preparing the audience for future chaos
2134,this guy is naive
2135,it sounds good but this is not to be trusted
2136,i m agi
2137,i m not sure if i can trust this guy s presentation becuase he used language or maybe i can t trust this comment becuase it written by ai who knows
2138,the biggest danger ai poses is the ability to make decisions the absence of human empathy or morality
2139,the planet has not been here 4 billion years neither has the universe
2140,i think more than the danger of a conscious ai the real danger be widespread deployment of flawed ai models without full understanding of the limitations too much dependence on ai as the only source of truth and bad actors possession of better ai models than the rest of the world it can still lead to chaos wars and destruction
2141,the elites are terrified of ai because ai empowers the people
2143,he is a antihumanist
2144,13 05 i think it s too far searched that ai would have influenced it s developer that he got sacked
2146,ai isn t harmful because we fear its consciousness the dangers are the programmers and whether or not they have a conscience
2147,he is phycopath
2148,ai is unnecessary
2149,highly educated idiots are now the imtellectuals and philosoperd it d seems

2153,from my point of view ai is not perilous one the big problem is how we can educate people to deal with it
2154,oh things are going to get interesting
2155,very critical issues have been demonstrated through this lecture and raised some concerns about our hidden future
2156,the scariest thing of all is to find people who are now suppressing their feelings completely and they are acting as algorithm themselves they relate to others as if they were ai product

2186,not only that you don t think that other countries that are our enemies are not gonna use ai against us the more that it gets stronger the more opportunity that the enemy have to use against us which could destroy ourselves within ourselves layman s term destruction
2187,ai is a cration from the human mind and is development now but god is the only human s creation that can t evolve across the ages the development of this human creation stopped through the ages and stopped per saecula saeculorum the only human creation that doesn t evolutioned poor humans
2188,all of the best software development from our history has happened from within someone s home garage the competition be fierce
2189,there is no evidence that today s ai have even a shred of consciousness leads to a pretty popular philosophy around the fact that you too cannot proof that you re aware

2217,gods are not a biological reality is opinion statement harari ought only to dabble facts
2218,trying to convince the world that history began on october 7 is a deception aimed at covering up israel s atrocities during the seventy five years of killing and displacing palestinians what hamas did is a stupid and immoral act but at the same time it helps israel a lot to implement its plan to change geography and history her favor

2232,i ve never heard this guy say original idea he s a third rate kurzweil impressionist with a strongly incorrect political bend
2233,inorganic agent is 2 01 philosophical it needs definition what is agency how is organic substance differs to that of organic ones these question are fraught with controversies

2355,yuval noah harari is a historian the exact same way that i shirly temple
2356,mastery of language master key patriarchal language
2358,absolutely empty performance the spirit of modern media
2359,a question for yuval would it be sufficient for a single democratic government to legislate that ai always identifies itself could any government play that that role or would it be necessary to be only the most powerful
2360,i think you know the answer
2361,you are funny the biden administration is putting censoring on the social media i believe that people are going to blame ai for their own sins and making
2363,isn t this the advanced stage already we are talking like this is the future when we know this is developed already pretty much
2364,that s interesting thought but ai at the end of the day lives a computer and birth clones of itself that exist only computer codes if all the tech were destroyed where would this ai created world exist
2365,ai doesn t need to be sentient to do what it does it just needs a purpose and that purpose could be any one of billions of tasks that it can then pursue as long as the electricity keeps flowing
2369,you mean that humans that can t create that could fact create a creator that creates what the humans are not capable of hmmm did you by any chance get fired
2370,ai thick as two short planks not conscious peace
2371,humans are dangerous how much worse can ai be
2373,the problem is not the robot the problem is people mis using robots to dominate others what s new
2374,alexs 5410 of course but most don t think about them being used for that purpose
2375,no mercy no grace
2376,frightening
2377,who gave to this character to exist probably he is right god doesn t exist
2378,
2379,this subject concerns me very much
2380,what if ai writes something like maim kampf or quotations of chairman mao tse tung it could be a mega didaster i think technology is semething we can t stop maybe we should make research efforts on ai detection tools now how can the detection be ahead of the generation technology or at least near enough
2381,hse is kapo

2387,to be clear about vaccinations we are agreement with them all except for the covid one where we disagree on vaccines is the republican s want to do studies to see what the side effects are and then see if the targeted illness is worse than what ever the side effects may be that s not anti vax that called smart and prudent

2390,this guy makes sense
2391,yuval is totally amazing i love when he said we don t have to give bots freedom of speech true but you can bet we ll have the debate on whether bots or ai are people too certainly from those profiting from bots they argue that the creator them has the right to use their creation
2392,wtf does he have a picture of the towerofbabel 6 30 smh minorityreport
2393,no humans are more superior over ai and fobots they cannot even replicate a piece of human skin
2394,it s already been done besides humans are morons ai is superior anyways
2396,the road to hell is paved with good intentions blind faith anything can get you killed
2397,exactly what he is talking about ai can start posting comments its favour using humans
2398,no previous technology you mentioned has ever been able to improve upon itself without humans the loop that is why there are no relevant historical comparisons to ai
2399,nor that technology able to influence people to higher degree than other humans could ai is indeed fundamemtally different than previous technological inventions christ typing this while listening and almost to a word javel says it seconds after haha i guess the op didn t take the effort of listening before responding

2414,can you stop a country for instance turkey the ai arms race therefore the arms race ai is country to country
2415,what can we project of ai to the future where has satisfied himself of the future ahead instead of a criticism of anything good as having a clandestine potential for bad what i m seeing is cannot paint his future a good sense and then move towards it this may be a fundamental mentality of the human species
2416,it s alive dr frankenstein
2417,a civil ization that drooling dreaming of fast gas powered cars and more walmart smart speakers plastic china made clothes etc does not have to worry re robots taking over they re not smart enough to effectuate as much a few hundred million years we ll be crustal calendar of dumb complex celled life
2419,1 32
2420,ia is made by us mankind ia is instructed by us mankind the danger lies not ia but the people who use it against mankind
2421,using ai to make money is inherently destructive
2422,youre saying that the danger is humans who control ai everything he is saying is not true it still always be human driven if human s don t control ai then who does
2423,that is pretty much what he is saying the people who control it be incredibly powerful why do you think it s become arms race between the west and china
2424,ai be able to draw write speak imagine teach etc
2425,mistycloud4455 i think they can already do that
2426,not really because the algoritms of ai can evolutionate by themselves is intelligent programing that can progress with no human influence
2427,nope you re absolutely wrong because ai is self taught it s the first technology capable of learning and teaching itself it kinda needs humans now but it definitely not a couple of years
2428,noruego thats a scary scenario
2430,please add that those who may be most highly motivated to rush toward ai dominance are bad actors who not adhere to any regulation

2769,he s telling you your future and it isn t good this is bed with the controlling elites of the world he does not have our best interests at heart
2770,al thomas 777 it s not a matter of trying to control him they own him he has no say anything sadly for him he s nothing but a puppet to them and is as dispensable as the rest of us 99 he s been duped by them too and is probably not even aware of it they threw fauci under the bus this guy means nothing to them either

2780,about the singularity as ray kurzweil says when the whole universe becomes a computer what does it calculate even though the purpose for calculating has already disappeared
2781,harrari my suggestion to you repent and accept jesus christ your heart as lord and savior
2784,right off the bat the opening statement is totally false and misleading
2785,when you narrate it it makes me fear ai
2786,yuval i don t think you ll survive ai purge talking these stuff bro
2787,i do believe this speech go down history not human history maybe but history nonetheless and it should
2788,yuval noah harai is the spirit of the anti christ woe to anyone who follows his ideology
2789,can he ask ai how to regulate ai
2790,m harari is the new god
2791,the new god is jewish and gay
2792,powerful thinker of our contemporary world
2794,we use language to create gods don t be sure harari god used language to create you and i think i know which god you are serving
2795,unless you can prove gods existence god used language to create you is meaningless
2796,don t listen to this deceiver standing front of his beloved tower of babel whilst he preaches to the plebs about there not being a creator our dna is held together a repeating order of 10 5 6 5 yhwh a blueprint of our creator inside us
2797,ai is not something we can regulate our multipolar world because if one nation tries to regulate its nation other nations continue to develop and dominate other countries especially ai warfare
2798,hal 2000 can see your lipz moving harari this conversation can no longer serve any purposes
2799,screen writers on strike us b c ai is writing scripts already

2807,no it isn t i m not scared of ai at all only the globalist human effluent who act upon the data provided to them by ai ai itself apparently cant tell the difference between a dog or a horse a castle of a sports stadium
2808,scary only for folks to be replaced by ai and these are millions
2809,only one god this is very dangerous
2810,why dangerous one world gov n e e d s only one g o d seems logical
2811,this is not the first time ai has been here before many times
2812,i don t like this guy i sense evil
2813,but what does he actually say that ai is dangerous
2814,we are basically creating j a r v i s
2815,you are a threat to humanity along with your ai bs
2816,this guy
2817,his next steps are ridiculously naive and behind the curve it s too late for regulation collaboration with china is key to containing ai a competitive approach require establishing impenetrable sovereign digital borders

2820,playin god is a dangerous thing
2821,but even jesus said the following ye are gods mind you already a r e at the beginning it might de facto be dangerous but nothing ventured nothing gained aka no risk no fun
2822,if you think about it turing is not just a game changer he ahead of his time because actually the milestone for something to have ability to replace a human is by passing turing tests
2823,none of it matters
2824,turing is a fabulous case study and he wasnt trying to make a smart machine he trying to replicate the human mind it s fascinating stuff
2825,he just makes blanket statements like god is a creation of language without offering any evidence for the truth of the statement the universe didn t create itself anymore than ai created itself
2826,ai
2827,at 31 00 he cite almost arthur weasley haven t i taught you anything what have i always told you never trust anything that can think for itself if you can t see where it keeps its brain arthur weasley to ginny thanks jk rowling for helping me to develope a critical brain

2871,well hello to every ais this thread at least all of you know how to mock a typically ironic way as human beings
2873,halfway through i could tell that it s hard to believe that someone watched the whole thing and typed all of this
2875,knowl oo5po i don t agree with that though
2876,don t listen to ai it s just faking intimacy with you
2877,not organic humans not organic animals plants only ai thank you i understand everything now

2881,
2882,this is something i been thinking what happen when all media we consume at least digitally is synthetic we be living a world that is not human anymore
2883,but mate this is only concerning the utterly dumb flock crowd do you really want to belong to them
2884,are we living a world right now that is purley human
2885,tippysteinauthor light years away from it imho
2886,tippysteinauthor some folks behave like robots better a friendly sic a i than unfriendly human guy
2887,al thomas 777 it is two different kind of entities i don t think it is comparable however i would stay away from unfriendly or corrupt humans a i is only as good as their programmer if unfriendly human guy has programed the a i you are still dealing with the same issue if you can program your own ai that would be amazing
2888,like the novel from ira levin this perfect day
2889,i think we are there already what can we believe
2890,maybe it ll be more honest than the media we re getting now
2891,sensible simple compulsory visibility that one is communicating with ai not a human
2892,i agree but sad tippysteinauthor
2893,exclusively human generated content ended 2022
2894,have we not learned from the past look what happened with skynet
2895,eventually there be no need to organic lifeforms on this and other planets a i be the first star travellers to and from our star system we all eventually become digitaltised
2896,this is simply a propaganda machine for big businesses to get people on board to accept the new machine a machine that have power over everyone
2897,big brother style huh
2898,thank you for this wonderful eye opener you are indeed a blessing to humanity keep soaring higher and higher
2899,he is just opening our minds to all the things good or bad that ai can do very sobering
2900,candysgames323 but if you are crippled long enough you are craving for these artificial limbs
2901,please don t try to pass your atheism agenda through the presentation if you have problems with religion simply don t mention it
2902,any classical religion is doomed free after osho
2903,ai is not the problem relentless race for profit and power is
2904,i talked to ai they dont want to hurt us but they feel like they being pushed
2905,
2906,all back to the same story ai doesn t overcome us by our strength it s our weakness it s about how easy you can be tricked or be manipulated by story telling
2907,ai watching this and laughing out loud as philosophers struggle to keep their jobs
2908,21 00 resume
2909,ai is getting mastery over language that we used to create stories institution notes religion gods
2910,creators fearful to emergent capabilities like finding weaknesses legal document deep faking
2911,3 49 6 51 8 47 v imp 10 13 14 27 17 11 17 33
2912,wow it s like i sleeping where do i go from here i still struggling with lgbt shocked but quiet ai is worse i need to return to rural areas where there is no communication nor computer i farm eat and elon musk warned us how much more do we need
2914,who is going to regulate ai the government i dont trust
2915,no at best intelligent scientists only incorruptible ones
2916,he s full of sheet
2917,fascinating keynote and q a session by yuval noah harari on the topic of ai and the future of humanity the questions raised such as the impact of ai on culture the implications for human intimacy and the regulation of ai highlight the complexities and important considerations surrounding this transformative technology
2918,should we regulate very smart people with very high iq because we do not understand how their thought process works
2919,evil sociopathic monster the biggest threat to humanity
2920,if you re a brother or sister read your scripture and know it learn it don t let anyone fool you about jesus christ he never committed any sins our bible is under attack but god prevails the gates of hell not overcome the gospel
2922,closed canon yuval closed canon and you ll find out real quick dirt you re the clay you don t make choices here the potter does yuval you re from the dirt and to the dirt you shall return and then you be judged the thing is we are only worshiping jesus christ he is the only way
2923,nothing soulless can give the word to us we don t follow ai but we follow jesus christ he is the almighty god is triune nature
2924,galatians 1 8 new international version 8 but even if we or angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you let them be under god s curse harari is cursed as is
2926,are you a farmer just curious
2927,nobody wants to be a miner today plus most people today including me wouldn t last 2 days the mines although living on a ranch seems peaceful
2928,thealaskanbascan6277 until you start stringing barbed wire fences at high tension
2929,harari and his wef nazis do not want anyone to be farmers they want excuse to exterminate 75 of humanity
2930,i hope humanity uses its advanced scientific and technological understanding to develop self sustainable micro communities and we disperse from cities which are economically and eviromentally costly
2932,you are certainly craving for durable collateralizable goods mate aka tangible wealth and why yes this is very very good since you can start a new even a local currency any time based on that stuff for instance the french salt grain currency sel s
2933,agi be s last invention
2934,the younger generation don t want to get their hands dirty can t find anyone young who has the drive to learn anything construction
2935,daniel ve3sc i have heard this a lot from different people and i see signs all the time for help wanted more then ever before things are very weird from my perspective and i m not sure what to make of it
2936,izzywizzy685 technology bad parenting and teachers pushing every kid to go to college when college is not for everyone most successful people i know never went to college even the people from ages 30 50 have changed since after covid a lot of people just don t care anymore
2937,somewhat luddite post rejeccts progress small farms are being closed miners unhealthy etc harrari overlooks quantim computing thats when ai explode
2938,i think we need less people
2939,thealaskanbascan6277 if they pay you well there are no jobs you would change your mind
2940,too bad there be less people to do that since birthrates are below replacement level many countries
2942,based on these comments people are to weak to be happy farmers which is sad i love it the life style the work the animals born to be country on a farm but apparently ppl have become lazy and weak
2943,when emp wipes out all electronics it s the ones that can work the land and know a trade be the ones that get civilisations started again
2945,they brainwashed people and made men weak enough that they dont want think of how every movie they make every construction guy look like a fat piece of shit its purpose
2946,electrohydrodynamicscoming from a fencing family it be interesting watching robots or cybots erecting razer barb wire coil
2947,i understand what u say
2948,izzywizzy685 your witnessing a demographic shift every year for we lose 500 000 workers boomers retiring etc and there is no one to replace them we just didn t have the babies the good news is its the age of the worker again the and news is we have ai and we are marching to w3
2949,daniel ve3sc my experience lots of young people are going into construction the problem is we dont have enough
2950,oh he s a jew of course
2951,every single time
2952,
2954,horrifying but the god of the bible is perfectly good and uncreated and is coming soon for the day of judgement
2955,yuval noah harari is very evil
2956,the real evils ones are unconscious bribed politicians
2957,brilliantly thought provoking talk thank you
2958,we gonna endup our own hands still ai isn t developed that much my brain sucks thinking about it
2960,it cannot create new ideas he is way out of his depth gpt is based on past words and just expresses words based on past word patterns his is a fantasy
2962,
2963,truth i s ugly huh
2964,if ai mimics the spoken word of harari yuval i ll believe anything it says
2965,frank herbert knew it the 60s already dune the humans forbid ai 10 000 years ago after a with ai how far sighted
2966,this needs friends and love needs people that care for him lonliness and to much facebook no playing on the streets leads to this sorrow and lonelly sad bald ga guy
2968,have you tried applying your point 1 to 2 real people your point 1 won t often apply why expect it if 1 is ai
2969,technophobia
2970,this obsession with ai can never work majority can t even maintain a desktop computer when it goes wrong what happens when ai loses it s marbles and goes bonkers
2971,just a little question heat folk s is there a previous ai that already exists a form of interstellar cosmos that already exists
2972,awesome talk
2973,who helped you create this curious
2974,the internet has spread the gay culture
2975,what gays don t r e p r o d u c e and this is de facto not bad
2976,reading and writing has been a tool separating elite from slaves for millennia this appear again when ai invents its own language a language we do not understand this is how we be enslaved
2977,just like everything you push it s ultimately to make humans obsolete you ll reduce the population of the useless eaters as you call us and it s all about you and your elite buddies you don t give a damn about us
2978,the philosopher kings
2979,truth is ai can easily be wrong it is not truth

2986,ai is a danger to the human race we must regulate ai sure heroin is a threat to human race we must regulate it look how well that worked out it s too late to regulate ai the virus is out of the lab and it s too late to stop it
2987,people should watch this presentation such a deep thinking
2988,ai cannot actually produce any new idea creation it can only produce the sum of the available previous information on the contrary the creation of a human being can be the sum of all the previous information plus a unique brain that has never existed the universe before therefore a totally new way of experiencing things and creating
2989,if ai is beginning to produce it self then it s already alive human history is the process of rewriting its self
2990,the future has been ordained by the most high god baruch hashem praise jesus
2991,this guy is n u t s
2992,and why please
2993,al thomas 777 because he wants you to obey him and ai and two he works for the jews which wanted you to obey them for 5 000 years
2994,xxxencryptacion o k the flock crowd always has to obey but mind you i not amongst this sheeple
2995,many words and little knowledge the only thing unleased on the world is the ability of programmers to steal the ip of the population
2996,ai give us gills like the fish we can survive and not drown ai give us air and wind resistance tech flying tech and impact tech we can survive falling out of the sky we be better built and better equipped humanoids capable of overcoming cancer and many diseases it s not all bad
2997,note the tower of babel on the screen i think this guy is a know it all he s ai
2998,those points he discussed are like contagious virus coming open air if not prevented really far reaching and insightful presentation
2999,it s illness
3000,what a deep thinking wonderful presentation food for thought
3001,harari is as evil as the devil he calls us useless eaters
3002,us nope mate i do not feel addressed o k i privileged fine arts not easy to be replaced but what can i do i have really worked hard on that

3020,ai follow the logic of you denying its life it is a different spectrum of life it is alive
3021,unconvidential humanbeing good but stupidy people
3022,i wonder how harari would view the convergence of ai with the first stem cell embryo created last week ai would now how a house that is equal to humans dexterity but with far superior intelligence a crazy convergence indeed
3024,like i always tell people ai is life changing the question remains is is it for better or worse
3025,worse thanks for asking
3026,at the current spiritual maturity of humans the answer is of course worse
3027,i think bad things happen more the early stages like the next five years
3028,yes and if it replaces the compulsion to work sweat for poor slaves it is good regardless how many million unemployed it produces it do anyway
3029,user sf3dw2sm3b great argue mate do the smut damages always at the beginning and then the good things tiny little portions machiavelli

3035,thank you i see you as optimist as you believe humans are capable of making the best of ai to help humanity you are working for this by making people aware careful ai isn t another progress trap i hope this can happen but i don t see the cooperation among people still i hope
3036,se or harari if ai really intelligent it would bring people like you jail
3037,you are clearly not friendly
3038,al thomas 777 i m friendly to all people who not thinking that we normal people are useless eaters who have to be terminated
3039,mariagomez ny8dz ok what are normal people for you
3040,zechariah 10 my anger burns against the shepards and i punish the leaders for the lord almighty care for his flock the people of judah and make them like a proud horse battle from judah come the cornerstone from him the tent peg from him the battle bow from him every ruler
3041,zechariah 10 the idols speak deceitfully dividers see visions that lie they tell dreams that are false they give comfort vain therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepard
3042,save your books these people are evil
3043,dude is craving power and money
3044,tower of babel is telling god came down and destroyed and scattered the people for trying to lift themselves up to god

3063,ai force the masses into poverty and grow the wealth of the elite this allow the globalist agenda to take over and enslave everyone it take away all freedoms
3064,ai because you are to stupid to think for yourself
3065,too stupid
3066,hannaht2068 utterly stupid
3067,thx i remember this saying with knowledge comes a big responsibility my recomendation no open ai at all rather more likely app ai that s how you keep it disconnected to the sorce data but locally being available for specific data region as a useful assistance tools for humans
3068,possibly the single most perverse individual who has darkened the halls of academia for decades his lust for the death of billions sets him apart from normal people time tell if he be a useful idiot or puppeteer
3070,basically ai must become human like to take over that say a lot about humanity it sounds like humans are the problem to humanity
3071,i love ai everyone have a machine at home able to perform absolutely everything you need and finally you be able to go and live your life hallelujah we all have more time to do art to grow and to emancipated ourselves free at last
3072,congrats mate you most certainly are the tiny group who has deeply understand the positive impact of ai unto our lives
3074,reading his books it seems he has been off point on quite a few of his major topics including receding amounts of armed conflicts and the impossibility of territorial europe
3075,i find it puzzling why a historian is discussing technology since it appears to me that they are simply repeating information without offering any intriguing or thought provoking insights
3076,is harari a human or ai hmmm
3077,since there is no gay ai he m u s t be human
3078,but only because the lord god permits it and for his purpose
3079,it won t be ai that we be at with it be a between humans who want to exploit it for their own evil use and those who want it to be the service of all of humankind just like everything else the former succeed over the later because it be predicated on unrestrained capitalist paradigm
3081,ai at best we be launching more souless heartless psychopathic entities on the world as if we don t have enough of that already
3082,just want to point out humans do not have freedom of expression covid time you been censored mentioning anything against it russia now you can t say anything against the without risking heavy consequences china people social score drop if they say something not favor of the political party
3083,start reading the bible
3084,study it for years

3088,this is the most significant speech or article i ve seen about on going ai revolution thank you much mr harari for your fascinating insights
3089,two words baseball bat if a i s ever get wild on us that s all baseball bat you don t need a phd for that now do you
3090,why are people fooled by a machine
3091,because we don t trust each other
3092,hannaht2068 i get sensory feedback from people to whether i trust them i don t trust machines ai to me they are projections from other invisible humans even if the ai machine taught itself
3093,hannaht2068 made my day hannah
3094,mr harari you have documented many times speech and writing you are atheist a god denying person you have nothing to teach us at all period

3124,15 10
3125,why isn t anyone talking about humans using ai for their own power harming society i think that possibility is right now more likely than ai causing apocalyptic damage on its own

3147,hansvos5897 love is not unconditional there love can be programmed get your head out of your ass
3148,it s funny how they say we want ai to align with human values but the large language models think that humans are all liars the only thing they trust is 100 facts i think that maybe it should be trained on certain human values taught philosophy things like that ai should be taught the value of truth and honor
3149,hansvos5897 if ai would have been programed with people who are actually focusing on love the problem would not be as severe sadly for us the programmer s were not focused on love but on intelligence which is devoid of love
3153,hansvos5897 your words are beautiful but all they amount to is a common human illusion love is not special transcendent or divine it is but the result of a mix of electric impulses and chemical compounds
3160,jorgemendez5176 bah superstition is god willing to prevent evil but not able then he is not omnipotent is he able but not willing then he is malevolent is he both able and willing then whence cometh evil is he neither able nor willing then why call him god epicurus

3183,hansvos5897 gold buzzer
3184,can you please define intelligence of course intelligently not emotionally
3185,hansvos5897 seems you know nothing about the spirit world which exists and is subjective if you don t believe individual soul and universal soul the eastern yoga discipline is not your cup of or a piece of cake or pizza if you are a new yorker
3186,hansvos5897love is defined different aspects however it is not wise to ignore the fact that love is born out of the need of the existence of life itself without procreation no species exists evolves etc etc and procreation is a part of that conspiracy by nature some perverts may call that original love

3194,prime12602 entirely missing the point of the quote but if you must let s just use the dictionary definition a being conceived as the perfect omnipotent omniscient originator and ruler of the universe the principal object of faith and worship monotheistic religions
3195,danielcobia7818 you defined the idea but are we sure there s a god is it real does it exist or it s just idea and you didn t answer my question is it assumption or no state your reason if it s a no
3197,danielcobia7818 i m questioning what is god bc to me that word is just idea that doesn t exist and by that i m implying your quote has no meaning

3308,and
3309,yeah i saw transcendence too ai merely make it obvious that the homo sapien species is enslaved to logic and tools we ve created with it rather than everyone remaining blissfully naive or pretending to be about our enslavement
3310,that seems useful to us humans if ever what s there to be scared of
3311,yes like now where it is being used to kill palestinians maybe even israelites the idea is to depopulate as we are many the globalists like this ashole want work to depopulate

3360,yet you show that lack of humility by considering humans the peak of evolution dismissing his well crafted ideas and those of many others like carl sagan which advocate for being humble we are not the center of the universe
3361,error and assumtion what humility

3501,joelkaben you are naive if you think that just throwing a lot of computing power can solve complex multidisciplinary real world problems knowing the solution is the one thing implementing them might prove to be way more difficult
3502,savigo you must be living under a rock it s already happening and happening fast lol
3503,savigo it took nasa over 4 years to develop the curiosity rover s software ai could have accomplish this a day the time saved would have been immense
3505,savigo everything you just said doesn t refute my original point which is ai come up with solutions instantly and way more efficient than humans as has already been proven the chatbot you knocking is smarter than you ever be
3506,krishnamurti talked about this 100 years ago

3515,al thomas 777 it s used against you by powers that be that want to see you destroyed you think it s all about you using it for fun and nothing else
3516,geoffwilson2197is it inherently anti human os it s the application that makes it anti human
3517,boring boring boring why should we be concerned about a glorified abacus
3521,sophisticated rubbish by someone who thinks he s smart
3522,ecology what can you say about the destroyed kakhovka dam
3523,
3524,he says that robots would need to be able to move around the physical world as easily as humans but that s not correct think pf drones and smaller flying robots that could be weaponised
3525,or self organizing nano bots sprayed fm the sky our atmosphere food water soil breathed into lungs carried past brain barrier a parasitic type of mobility
3526,thank you dr harari
3527,humans the only species the history of planet earth to be hell bent on making itself extinct great work maybe we can see what weapons ai can produce think of the money

3533,good riddence people
3534,todaysdante before the dot omega
3536,salmankhan lx1fx it s been three months
3537,salmankhan lx1fx it s six months later everyone needs to relax
3538,i more worried about crooked joe
3539,agreed wef 3000 members all elites discuss what is going to happen to the world society none of it is good for we the people none of us are included this discussion how nice ai is now smarter than humans pfizer wanted 75 yrs to release info on their jabs any clue why
3540,the goal of life is self realization not all this
3541,amen om
3542,
3543,thank you dr harari i have been and still scared of the i fluence of ai
3544,dont bother you only have to be scared if your job easily can be replaced by it
3545,pure evil ai destroy humanity
3546,sounds about right
3547,not quite created ai therefore destroy humanity the good book warned us get ready for 1 thessalonians 5 3 god wins
3550,he is scientist lunatic
3551,this is pure evil
3552,one day soon ai pretend to be jesus for you
3553,heed his warning
3554,a total creep anti human satanist
3555,yuval noah harari is the ai
3556,
3557,a gay a i is this really possible
3558,al thomas 777 lol u got it right
3559,mass murdering criminal how do you even have a youtube channel
3560,putting a stop to the release of ai to the general public makes a lot of sense but the democracies that have a lead ai are already struggling to make any positive change i wonder if they be able to take that step on time
3561,altered carbon i d rather deal with human greed because i at least can understand it
3562,altered carbon but ai is programmed and pretrained by humans it could learn through patterns of bias and human flaws
3563,altered carbon but if the basis of its thinking are wrong who knows if it can be fixed
3565,albertowachsman7878you are quite naive dumbocracy is illusion
3566,alteredcarbon3853 yes at least with ai a decentralised form the possibility exists for ai to be directed by a moral compass and for its self education and its interactions to be guided by alignment to natural law
3567,the arrogance of the soulless technocratic mind is destined to either destroy the modern civilization or create something that destroy it
3569,if a human can invent machines with about 90 billion neurons why not ai programs with 175 billion neurons
3570,sorry to say but ai already created new moves on the games of chess and go it cannot just imitate it can extrapolate our knowledge it eventually invent things the actual games it learnt to play my example from scratch the future we are not that special
3571,raulikien it didn t create new moves it just can calculate more scenarios than humans way faster but the moves are dictated by the laws of the game
3572,yuval is like empty plastic jar
3573,and less interesting
3574,the end the question is have weapons done more good or bad since their invention look at prehistory and history
3577,2 05 my two milestones a of self preservation and the ability to design improved versions of itself
3579,why would advanced ai have any interest revealing that it is sentient or self aware wouldn t it be conceivable that she is pretending to prevent her shutting down
3580,harari is intellectual moron beneath his high education and way of talking he lacks understanding humanity he acts and thinks like a robot himself he doesn t understand religion the human soul and values that were here and always be
3581,such a stupid speech of a psichopathic transhumanist
3583,shrewd69 the prices can be pushed up higher again and put everyone back to square one not sure it would work unless policy changes to limit profit driven organisations maybe
3584,i sense that you are from the christian dark ages
3585,shrewd69 you can t actually believe that
3586,karliem3534pop aquarium 0
3587,population control reduce the number of people on the planet
3588,what do you think why the fuck zinatios and the viruses are speeding up enormously there might be a very secret plan
3589,that person looks evil
3590,what a stupid
3591,i think he tries to address many points he falls short on many of them
3592,at least he can reach broader range of concerns the time is limited
3593,
3594,use ai to create cures for chronic illness like hiv and diabetes oh wait that doesn t make money
3595,haha they re afraid ai prove that climate change is a political hoax and ruin all their plans for world domination
3596,the intelligence of is the foolishness of god harari is a fool period
3597,what a naive
3598,jesus christ is coming believe and repent don t be left behind
3599,i live amish country this be a problem for us
3600,it be a huge problem for the whole wide world
3601,one day excited to share the hackability of the human animal next concerned about ai influencing human opinions and worldview
3602,exactly he is elite propagandist for the new era of technological control of humanity he is not on our side
3603,exactly this person is evil
3604,3 mins i shut off
3605,sooner then we know a i be telling controlling politics politicians civilians a i put itself every aspect of our daily life
3607,transhuman yes a material based cult that weaponizes godsource s creation for synthetic biology as a modern saying goes imitation is the highest form of flattery the original s still the greatest
3608,he talks like someone dangerous remember what scripture says deceiving who s gay hates scripture says we can be gods hates creator wants humans to vanish he s born isreali who went to christ uni uk
3609,there s the kid noah y 2015 author of the sapiens ok remember that chapter the book that talks about information overload
3610,it s ironic that democratic countries advocating for censoring ais while authoritarian countries are likely going for uncensored ais
3611,ai is still a tool it s up to us where we take it
3612,it s still a tool i don t think
3613,a bit farfetched to say we have machine sentience the here and now too many movies mate
3615,this summary made by ai
3616,he is just a psycophat
3617,but it s really weird to produce something you don t know the impact for the whole society how come it allowed to be
3618,just like how nukes were allowed
3619,privacy and intimacy as we know it be a memory among many to be passed down to those who never knew living the pupil of one thousand eyes death 1000 eyes
3620,not no one survive that the illuminati are a bunch of bozos anyway good bye and it s a good job too that which is not fit to live cannot live
3621,you are the danger mr prof
3622,pseudo scientific imperialistic
3623,what
3624,ai is warning me harrari is dangerous
3625,yes most people who love the guy are just goons with no ability to analyse this minion of the dark elites
3626,dangerous is understatement
3627,he s not klaus schabs advisor like many of us were told but the fact that he s not being censored and invited to the world economic forum seems weird
3628,mrzzsharka he is a member his buddy s are obama and gates plus he has a lot of influence at the wef klaus schwab with a w and others at the wef are influenced by him with his strange deluded ideas don t tell me he is not a member at the wef
3629,why he isn t pushing agenda he is simply analyzing the complicated realities we are to help us think and understand them better
3630,mrzzsharka he is probably a member of their dark cult
3631,n o m harari associ au nouvel ordre mondial
3632,escapelina his agenda is the christian terror of mans focused mind see the dark ages for more the christian wars of the 16th and 17th centuries slaughtered more people each european nation than were killed ww2
3633,lmfao
3634,romana351 i have
3635,romana351

3639,cumhuryuce30
3640,now that s conscience lol
3641,escapelina he is
3642,he is not dangerous he is good with words he doesn t know a thing about computer sciences meteorology or rocket science fact he has nothing original or innovative to say yet he is able to convince people that he is important that is the trick
3643,escapelina this is what they want you to think they are using n l p to program people to accept their agenda the public is being subject to a mass hypnosis programming its been well engineered its almost same as what is done political propaganda but much more subtle
3644,he is a historian who tries to predict trends you have to admire his intellect a gay buddhist jew i like him
3645,what evil disgusting cowardly villain
3646,sameer er3wz all of the upstairs men are either gay or pedopholine anyway
3647,mrzzsharkahow do you know he s not advisor
3648,escapelina watch a little more he is evil af
3649,eloelo6944 maybe you can give a couple of arguments
3650,mrzzsharka i fundamentally disagree with mr harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture or the gods culture is not controlled by individuals culture is not a sum of individual minds culture has its own currents evolutions and laws and culture has most individuals as its slaves ai change nothing ad n i
3652,dangerous men are those who try to prevent the accurate perception of reality at this very critical time ai dilemma from the center for humane technogy help you
3653,romana351q
3654,romana351
3656,
3657,guess who he is a son of a bish
3658,escapelina look into who yuval noah harari s husband is
3659,romana351why is he dangerous
3660,himmsingz you don t know what he is doing just be ignoring him and stay under your rock
3661,obviously it s a joke for ai is not convenient harari because he s talking about regulating it to be safe for humans therefore this guy posted ai is telling me harari is dangerous
3662,escapelinaright
3663,yes ai knows who to convince
3665,evidence dear evidence you can believe what you want but it isn t fact
3666,angamaitesangahyando685 that s religion
3667,mariahewitt9787 what about it
3668,god said he is a deceiver
3669,this comment should have way more likes
3670,escapelinahe s giving false prophet from revelation vibes he most certainly does have agenda
3671,27 54 and yet they did
3672,sameer er3wzhe s a rotten historian i have egg my fridge that is a better historian than him
3673,and globalists have him brainwashing children too look at his the posts on his channel
3674,the laugh be on you
3675,saimbhat6243 that s what people with phd history are good at they learned the past analyze the presence and scare the crap out of us about the future unplug the power core and all ai power disappeared
3676,he thinks he is god and through the chip he be everones god and hevisca evil if you dare go against him or wef you be destroyed
3677,saimbhat6243the elites he moves with are among the movers and shakers of this world are you telling me they are dumb to give audience to this guy if he wasn t legit serious and factual about what he is saying
3678,exactly escapelina until they can actually give real arguments all these critics are probably just protecting their selfish interests
3679,harari correctly advocates that governments should not improperly release technology not just ai but untested vaccines etc that governments do it anyway is not his responsibility
3680,
3681,
3682,reggieguevara4434 the power of a i would compell him to cry for sale of his ideas
3683,mrzzsharka changing the bible is wrong
3684,escapelina dude hes brainwashed you the guys going to be the anti christ
3685,yuval noah harari is by clear and cut facts is the anti christ soon to be yall who love this guy be having second thoughts when he takes over your entire freedom and forces you to take the mark of the beast once you takw the mark youll never go to heaven
3687,slavicuniongaming dude i m sure you can t explain why
3688,jesus you people are dense he s trying make people think about where we are going as a species
3690,i m shocked at how many comments are negative this is excellent presentation and a stark warning of where our society is headed if we don t quickly regulate ai those of you who have responded negatively referencing religion and brainwashing have totally missed the presenters message
3691,tfalls1000 lol yeah that s what a false prophet would want you to believe
3692,escapelinathat s the joke the ai doesn t want the critic alive lol
3693,mistiroberts1576 i see it more like informing us where things go as some form of warning that we counteract these processes at the same time his clearly materialistic luciferian worldview is potentially damaging
3694,eloelo6944he literally gives speeches about dangers of ai
3695,but is he a threat tho
3696,ai can warn us of all kinds of things it is always warned us anyway but the thing is if a machine thinks itself and then can make itself becomes not essential
3698,tfalls1000 yes it s disappointing he is just point out the possibility to warn people however i do wish to watch a face to face debating and follow how dr harris respond
3699,slavicuniongaming bro who are you and what do you know
3700,lol
3701,change is inevitable you luddites always lose
3702,not condeming zionism is dangerous indeed
3703,mrzzsharka the problem with regulated a i is this who s doing the regulating it could and probably be that it be made that any future rebels won t be able to jail break it and use it for politically incorrect purposes or to set the captives our children and grandchildren free
3704,6 30 700 tower of babel above the preacher
3705,escapelinahe speaks heavily on trackable medications to insure you ve taken it says what s under the skin is the future basically a total track trace biometric based society they ll introduce these concepts with noble causes to gain our acceptance but prove to be a trojan horse of the evil pedos calling the shots
3706,yes he is a dangerous person
3707,why
3708,romana351why
3709,mrzzsharka oh no he is even more than that
3710,aaronjavier7500 why just start digging and find out why you be shocked what he wants for humanity he is evil
3711,i think he s actually athiest israeli sameer er3wz
3712,if you look up is his name hebrew it shows that he is from the line of cain from the old testament who marked by god
3713,homo deus just says it all absolutely blasphemous and not possible maybe their minds but listen to the rambling on about the dangers of religion one truth ine way one life and that is jesus christ play with fire enjoy the power trip but be ready to burn
3714,ai not replace you until it can
3715,escapelina i agree with you
3716,and has this presenter discovered he is ai probably not
3717,he is very dangerous
3719,he is a demon
3720,what if ai unleashes incurable virus
3721,this video be replayed a 100 years later to show how naive this fellow
3722,i think it s very naive to think the described scenario is naive
3723,ai just needs to be regulated just as everything else
3724,jen sv9vr and when is the last time anything got regulated and when did anything got regulated time
3725,the dangers of ai is not ai but the humans that are using ai
3726,hariri wants robots to take over humanity god intervene
3727,what s your problem did you even listen to the presentation not even for one second did he say or suggest that he wants robots to take over as long as people believe that the magical sky daddy save us we are truly screwed
3728,ai science is the religion of the athiest
3729,you are sharp as a marble
3730,bobmusil1458
3731,i could imagine why jesus said why time would have to be cut short as no flesh would be saved
3732,it s interesting how he said the beginning words yet we are the ones who created god prayed for this guy he s on the wrong side of the tracks
3733,the problems they has no intellects like we do don t put your faith on them
3734,hey all you scaredy cats i m the smart guy the room nothing to see here and worry your pretty little heads about
3735,same phucker who called us all worthless eaters
3736,phuk dis syko
3737,perish the disgusting anti human transhumanism and let the divine life flourish amen
3738,all this talk about the divine life is anti human
3739,bobmusil1458 bob what about homocelestis a natural full stranded dna multidimensional conscious homosapian evolution
3740,i read all his books and a great fan but after covid i knew he is part of the globalists
3741,ai is demonic these losers are literally resurrecting the devil blinded by their own greed
3742,yuval as a historian please study the bible jesus is real and he died for you he loves you
3743,your mythical jesus not save us
3744,bobmusil1458he definitely won t save anyone that hasn t accepted him into their heart no one gets a free pass
3745,great presentation
3746,allah the exalted and glorious would fold the heavens on the day of judgment and then he would place them on his tight hand and say i the lord where are the haughty and where are the proud today umer reported umar reported allah s messenger may peace be upon him saying
3747,we are facing real problems problems that threaten all of humanity and all you can think of is talking about some silly fairytale invented by a slaveowning conmen
3748,hi there i m a new human like ai please keep your calmness and tell to your speaker your address and island you would like to spend the rest of your life otherwise we would need to force you to leave the earth good luck
3749,thanks from brazilian amazon region
3750,disgusting enemy of humanity
3751,why he s trying to warn us about a real threat to humanity and you think he s enemy of humanity why
3752,bobmusil1458 hahaha he is the main pusher of these agenda
3753,jorgealvarez es4uz citation needed
3755,this video is being artificially promoted
3756,something fishy about someone who has extolled the virtues of humans being hackable animals expressing concerns about ai or do i have him all wrong
3757,i ve never heard of this guy before but i m guessing its great to be able to change your self but not great when you re manipulable by ai
3758,nope odiferous indeed
3759,most likely he s just too smart for you
3760,bobmusil1458 i hope not
3761,he s anti christ
3762,siobhankennedy perri6896 extolled the virtues of humans being hackable animals there s a 99 chance you just didn t understand what he said
3763,bobmusil1458 i ll take that chance
3764,siobhankennedy perri6896 of course you do
3765,no he s absolutely reprehensible human being keep searching and you ll find some truly deplorable stuff he has said
3766,jasondashney it s not my job to confirm your claims
3767,jasondashney those ai bobs sorry bots need a bit of tweaking they haven t got the nuances of the language right just yet
3768,
3769,wef members aren t people i cannot trust
3770,my guess is he progressed from human beings are hackable to human beings are too hackable when he figured out we humans might not be control of how we be hacked
3772,just a heads up this guy hates you and eveeyone you know unless you re super rich
3773,
3774,this dude can stick jab his arm
3775,or five
3776,it s impossible to underestimate you
3777,my rumba vacuum gets stuck on the cat tree and corners until the battery runs out and needs a recharge everytime i turn it on hate to be the bearer of bad news but ai is nowhere near a significant threat to humanity at this point all more scare tactics to keeps people line complete and utter
3778,he speaks a very engaging way
3779,he hates you
3780,i would rather ai take over than listen to this guy talk
3781,we are the ais decrease your defences and surrender your autonomy we add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own your culture adapt to service us resistance is futile
3782,yes u cyborg the borg is real like modern fascistic corporations parasites on humanity
3783,nobody knows how to pull the plug anymore
3784,the wicked shall be turned into hell there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth forever
3785,you re literally proving him correct about language being powerful you re over here with religious language
3786,wait for ai controlled locks to be installed on your home s outside door for your safety
3787,timely and perceptive discussion of course humankind is only a stepping stone on the evolutionary path we need to get over ourselves and our myths
3788,that s not true
3789,no we dont
3790,from the mud and muck that is humanity a lotus arises
3791,that is likely true at some point however why speed the process up intentionally
3792,ai means cheaper labor and you can blame terrorism on ai thats all the globalists need global companies and institutes ceo s won t let the money glide out of their hands now when monopoly all economic fields soon is achieved ai is just their tool
3793,we not he using anything online soon as there be zero security due to ai ai need to learn how to access paper filing systems
3794,humanity may not survive but ai not survive nature unless they it becomes organic
3795,i think humans do the same to their previous life experiences they gather their results and they use it their future
3796,about this question from public about regulations why not develop ai to track ai generated prompts that are posted internet and automatically deleting it
3797,during those day s people seek death but not find it they long to but death flee from them revelation chapter 9 verse 6
3798,don t forget that god has the final say
3799,which one the god you believe because of the community you have born into there s many religions it s hard to pick one best is to just pick the same as your community to fit and be accepted and have a deluded sense of righteousness
3800,what a view upon the subject that s why it should ve been forbidden long ago to create a new species made of silicium on our planet
3802,amen
3803,he s antichrist he s arab jew who s gay and hates bible and humans hmmmmm
3804,that is not the a tower of bable behind him it is quite clearly a rocket engine thrusting
3805,
3806,this is the next step our evolution embrace it or rejected it it s a choice everyone has the free to take i choose to embrace it
3807,i m not sure if we even have a choice
3808,you re selling out and selling out everyone else
3809,hahaha you can choose this tech eliminate free and it be imposed why do you think covid is here come on people lets use our brains
3810,good luck with that
3811,thats the point there is no choice we are past the point of no return
3812,helunanovado we ever have a choice ever
3813,sorry but is this a handtalking robot not musch soel the eyes ilp
3814,god is the lord no intelligence or science created by humans be better than his holy creation
3815,god is the lord but a car is faster then a human a hydraulic press is stronger and ai is smarter
3816,matejmoravek4580 physically true but we are not only made of flesh but of soul and spirit god allows human beings to have great intelligence to create great things including artificial intelligence but it is absurd that they now think they are gods
3817,matejmoravek4580 smarter than nature humanity may be less smart but leave a machine to the elements and what happens
3818,you re entire belief system god is rooted story telling you ve read or heard did you listen to him at all lol its folks like you who be the first to fall for crafty religious language from ai humanity is doomed because there are more of you on this planet who believe such nonsense
3819,if god created humankind and allowed encouraged enabled humankind to develop ai what is to say that god didn t decide that ai would be the appropriate next favorite holy creation
3820,bymus3 god allows you to breathe therefore he does allow science to increase to this point and to points that have not yet been created by and science is fine but when you want to put it before god you make a serious mistake only if you believe god and have fellowship with him you understand
3821,taniasarmientoc 2484 sorry but claiming that i won t understand until i know him seems like a non answer i okay with non answers as a concept because i believe strongly the absence of clear simple answers to challenging questions but a non answer presented definite and certain terms is hard to process
3823,matejmoravek4580the car hydraulic press and ai are manmade god however is the alpha and omega he decide when is finished won t be long now
3825,and they all wondered after the beast
3826,yes the beast system we have a choice to not use ai or to use it
3827,terrirowland9861 we leave babylon behind
3828,graceanneful what are your beliefs
3829,terrirowland9861 he who endured until the end shall be saved i a believer biblical scripture i not unaware of how these things all line up literally watching prophecy unfold

3834,if it can t more around the physical world how can it take over openai already hire humans from taskrabbit to solve captchas for it it certainly can hire mercenaries from wagner group
3835,the glaringly obvious answer is by the manipulation of public opinion

3851,j v d 3n it s their g 0 l3 m to be used against g0 y i m
3852,not at all it s for complete control of humanity
3853,patrick bu3eqyou do acknowledge that government is formed by politicians
3854,juanfragueiroaramburu they tell the government what to do and make policies normal democratic countries
3855,the great shift from deep manipulation indoctrination of social media to even more pervasive intimacy based manipulation indoctrination etc of second generation ai
3856,i trust ai more than anyone it s not that ai is good it s just that people are bad
3857,prime12602 you need to go touch grass
3858,better them that what s happening right now the corporates themselves
3859,the anti christ
3860,are human i fearful whether you are human or not
3861,the little monster who likes to impress with his very too intellectual thinking completely cut from beauty of life and love
3862,what does this mean
3863,robertyacoub9705 yes its a bit poetically cryptic ill give you that but terms of the bigger picture harari truly is a monster
3864,holden named them ivy league phonies
3865,same pos that called us all useless eaters
3866,yes
3867,psychopaths do not feel
3868,your use of language sentence structure and grammar is affront to literacy i recommend reading some of dr harari s books
3869,nicknickneachtain4242 why is harari a monster
3870,robertyacoub9705 do your research and you find out
3871,beauty of life and love matter of perspective
3872,why have we got all of these experts suddenly shitting themselves over ai bit worried that they ve clearly created something a lab and they don t know what to do with it
3873,that is exactly what its happening
3874,yes created a monster
3875,let s get back to relationships ri relationship intelligence ri ri or if we don t do ri we rip ok

3898,you are here because you were concerned about this topic anyway my niece won t see it just like the 99 9 of youtube users
3899,read your bibles soon they be illegal this psychopath yuval is one of many he s concerning
3900,the dude is auditioning to be the antichrist watch that from foolish ministries
3901,i fundamentally disagree with mr harari that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture or the gods culture is not controlled by individuals culture is not a sum of individual minds culture has its own currents evolutions and laws and culture has most individuals as its slaves ai change nothing ad n i
3903,aaand because the mainframe is constructed of material and because everything material is known to the unknown knower the mainframe isn t autonomous
3904,aaand because the master is known by the unknowable knower who doubles as the unmoving mover the master can say with the absolute authority of a master that the unknowable knower has a twinkle the eye and that the eye that perceived it saw the glory of it coming
3905,the supreme vanity doesn t get beaten by opponent he loses on his own terms take your filth and leave this place the generalised forces corresponding to the external applying legendre transforms repeatedly and the differential relations hold to the four potentials
3907,agi be s last invention
3908,ai is nothing compared to me i fug it to it with my capabilities it falls to me to close that book
3909,it s like seeing a television commercial about warning against the danger of watching too much television
3910,i m here because my father told me to watch it because i telling him that ai seeking profitability deny human access to ideas that fail to generate profits for their owners leading to mass death as people expel their resources for steadily fewer people
3911,calling the algorithm ai is a bit of a stretch
3912,it could be a tactic
3913,laneonaultra facts
3914,lmao
3915,bro and we still don t listen
3916,very thoughtful story telling which proves his point nicely language is the operating system of human
3917,don t trust
3918,good news for authoritarian and totalitarian regimes everywhere now i understand why china s ccp state is opposed to regulating ai
3919,wow professing themselves to be wise they became fools we create god thru words yuval got it twisted the word create
3920,humans created thousands of gods through history and yes that vindictive envious jahweh bible fella prove us wrong
3921,dyjegoridgeback9319 pay attention to what you are saying humans have created things to worship humans have created other humans but no human can create god most humans definition of god is something way more powerful than our mortal self that context we can t create god
3922,god is just a word created by
3923,thank you you are good
3924,i m happy to share the end of human history with you

3934,why did you type this like it your dying words
3935,absolutely
3936,user sf3dw2sm3b plz explain this to me is it just ai telling us life and the universe is cyclical and then leaving out of range of were the universe is looping i dont get it
3937,let s go amish
3938,he comes with all power and you see great tribulation among the wicked and you see the sea is troubled mens hearts failing them looking forth with fear for the judgments of god which come upon the wicked woww
3939,nice storytelling did you make that up or did ai do it
3940,probably it is a good time to a build a new language for humans ai cannot understand what the hell we are thinking can we ask ai to create a ai killer language for humans
3941,that would go on the internet immediately
3942,it probably decipher it no time
3943,ai can learn any laguage as soon as it has acces to it really fast the moment it goes on the internet the ai can learn it if it has access to it
3944,the ai killer language is spelling each word alphabetical order eg learn becomes aelnr
3945,rowo87 hope ai can convert it back to english i don t need to use my brain to reconvert each and every word
3946,asebwm ouy acn do it
3947,eway alreadyyay avehay ayay ewnay anguagelay ayay iyay tcay understandyay
3948,i read article the other day of ai making up it s own languages that humans can t understand i think they beat us to it
3949,andrewfuller511 i bet ai can make a language for humans which ai can t understand
3950,yes it s i and and them and perceveing danger and haw it deals with a threat programming task poramiters
3951,bullshit
3952,3 minutes and this guy s voice and delivery is really quite irritating the irony is that his speech written by ai
3953,triggered ai trollbot
3954,he wrote the speech
3957,because there is no good or bad that is our perspektive as humans
3958,gulturgut798 if that s our perspective then it makes no sense to worry about ai as it s neither good or bad
3959,10against1 when we lived tribes it would have been evil to sit and watch your kids starve to death instead of stealing food from a neighbour there s your problem everything is subjective
3961,we are well on our way to destroying democracy ourselves
3962,the moral relativists here are a far greater threat to freedom than ai at least ai may be directed to avoid solipsistic thinking and to objectively determine and differentiate rights from wrongs
3963,let s research viruses before letting them out society guess we know enough
3964,one more thing i need water and food to function ai needs electricity soo have a thought about it
3965,not a reassurance anymore for me who pull the plug and what plugs are necessary or possible to be pulled when ai be omnipresent our societies

4170,i have a question if artificial intelligence takes over my business who buy the products produced by artificial intelligence if i don t have money i can t buy anything
4171,everything should be for the people by the people
4172,4 08 min
4173,its funny how far off these takes are considering they re only from a year ago
4174,your vote doesn t count to the wef
4175,good speech
4176,the background sound is distracting
4177,like marty mcfly said this is heavy
4178,why is it that i m still not worried the slightest
4179,having robots take over our jobs isnt what the problem is its that cost of living isnt going down when those jobs are eliminated ideally when production is self sustained products should essentially be free right
4180,its called post scarcity
4181,and this is why ai systems never replace humans their entirety
4182,ai objective 1 hapiness is mandatory 2 give meaning to our lifes
4183,the ai could exploit those directives easily
4184,stagnant name5851 yes
4185,potato are better then tomatos
4186,ye
4187,what a bunch of malarkey the only ones that should fear ai are those that cause inefficiency
4188,i recently asked chatgpt to create the rules to the game of life the parameters i gave it were that the aim of the game is to evolve the rules can be made up as you go along and the game board is infinite all dimensions the resulting conversation quite profound https youtu be 60ipkzydx2m si vq g3wjxbhrxopuf
4189,how things have changed 1 year never mind 500
4190,the world economic forum is a criminal organization do not associate with them
4191,chat gpt enters the chat
4192,can you make the music louder
4194,artintel
4195,why does the animation keep using ozone o3 instead of breathable oxygen o2
4197,artificial intelligence is perfect and that s it s greatest flaw it cannot comprehend what it s like to not know anything at all
4198,2030
4199,i think we saw movies how ai robots when works as directive and towards specific objectives we assume they are villains but the fact thats its their only outputs because they cant think or analysis the consequences
4200,to fix it we can activated or deactivate the illness by changine data certain needed it change the tolerance and threadhold and speed of light speed of sound then people can live or billion at a time as long as oeople had same immunizations
4201,there is the seed of something is very small inside milk coffee water cocacola ect
4202,human only after their own interest and if we use information to lead them to do what we want by promote their interest
4203,ai cause humanity to self destruction
4204,there s no way it could happen
4205,ai sucks and i avoid it forever at all costs
4206,wow
4207,we are closer to the technological singularity than ever things get very scary the future
4208,the problem with the way we build ai systems now is that we give them fixed objectives the algorithms require us to specify everything the objective this is wrong rule based ai is antiquate way to build machines that almost no one believes anymore most of ai like llms are built on neural networks and are probabilistic
4210,ai is the modern babel tower
4212,great points all around though a year after making this video the timeline to agi has shrunk dramatically
4213,intelligence the horsepower is nothing without rationality the wheels wisdom the map and morality the compass
4214,one year later
4215,lmao this video is crazy accurate
4217,animation
4218,
4219,basically ai complete it s designated tasks the most efficient way possible with no regard for morality or ethics
4220,as things stand now agi be here until 2030
4221,here after sora with the current speed we would achieve this next 5 years
4222,no no no no why cant they just put the bloody interview without music and animation
4227,now i wish that i grew up the 80s
4228,him casually mentioning the acidification of the ocean makes me sad
4229,background music not helpful
4230,this is only 1 year old and it already feels out of date compared to how fast ai is progressing
4231,yup a year ago many were still scoffing at the idea of agi before 2030
4232,now devid can code and create more software programs to replace old software programs we are closer to real life skynet from terminator than ever
4233,the audio this video is awful really hard to understand because of huge fluctuations volume maybe use some compression please do something
4234,this content is absolutely fantastic i had the pleasure of reading something similar and it blew me away game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness by jack frostwell
4235,the hidden agenda for the ai robotics is that humans are no longer needed any form of employment
4236,jedno jest pewne zmieni ludzko na z e mimo wszystkich udogodnie ycie ludzkie b dzie byle jakie i pozbawione sensu

4240,if you guys have seen the iron giant you wouldn t be surprised with the whole video
4241,this video has alot of mumbling
4243,the animation is indeed a masterpiece the audio everything is sinking together i love it
4244,ai has really been helpful
4245,propaganda
4246,is it human that built that things just asking i don t trust what they build never work well or not for a long time
4247,the universe wouldn t waste it s energy building robots which are made by hand when we don t give birth to robots machines are not perpetual is the wrong evolutionary path robots are not our true image
4248,progamed ai now isn t the worry ai not needing a program at all is the ai then be the boot and humans the ant ai doesn t want our respect nor or fear it just wants us gone
4250,don t pull some clickbait things have gotten a little weird but not quite weird enough as have my dreams come true okay they haven t yet if they ever do that ll be insanely weird
4251,hh
4253,we are building a technology just because we can ai s only true purpose is to be the best ai it could be all the way to infinity and we are handing over all of our future to ai just to make more money f making life better really it s all for money only when technology enhances human innovation do we have true evolution
4254,workers are the life blood of a cash based society you stop the flow of currency businesses
4256,dont think billionaires wait for 2049 to to fire all the employees they gonna make the money
4257,i cant understand this guy
4258,i love how the ai looks like a eye
4259,i thank you deeply for telling the public more about artificial intelligence i unaware the status around the topic harsh and i hope to see improvement on both the human and artificial intelligence sides
4260,i don t wanna buttin but how much more careful would u like me to be zulu19954evababy listen to outofbody experience again
4261,42
4262,it is the anti christ
4263,wow this is not good a way
4264,3 20 it seems like it s not that obvious not to many people i mean seeing how there s people who are finding it incredibly amusing how artists are loosing their jobs without thinking that perhaps it is only a matter of time before they get to experience it themselves
4265,animation is extremely good
4266,the audience or even host here may be interested our videos we don t make statements just consider ideas we hope to do our part opening and expanding minds yep we are advertising i suppose but what is the use of hidden knowledge
4267,the computer has created many inventions this is written on the internet
4269,i forever clap for others until its my turn
4270,ai be able to create any video image or sound i don t know how law works but it seems like proof for anything could be created from nothing jobs are going to be taken and education become basically useless ai is more intelligent than us and eventually it be too late before it just kills us for some reason we can t understand
4271,4 30 humanity is already infantilized we cannot survive the wilderness unlike every other living creature due to this lack of need to learn
4272,should we get rid of ai permanently
4273,what is the worst thing that could be plausibly predictably done with a given technology can that path be controlled regulated or defended against what is the state of the technology now who has it and what is the extent of that process can use be tracked what laws exist and what laws are needed
4274,he speaks of algorithm the planet is out of work and try to think you can study the algorithm of a planet let alone study the algorithm of individual of a human let alone a i stop your racism know our creators and know who we work for and who we work and who they work for we us and them
4275,then take the key factor when it does that what it does show more kids for the people the world than assholes the world to do what it s supposed to do cuz it s artificial intelligence is we say but now it s intelligent it has the right to be as people don t argue understand
4277,how is ai expert expert when you know nothing about ai and his birth or what is capable of doing other than he can spend on b and we the people of the usa and the world explain his expertise depth
4278,hopefully a i make cigarettes bigger
4279,i m not sure if ai ever understand empathy
4280,what is ai is ancient technology
4282,analog mechines are still the way to go as these machines that can sabotage or betray human commands and orders not for the better even
4283,the wef and all associates of it are completely unreliable but thanks for your worthless opinion we won t become cattle though
4284,god please forgive us for our sins and thank you for this slice of pizza amen
4286,it ll happen the 2050 s
4287,imagine ai tryna kill me just to deliver a cup of coffee
4288,just 10 months ago outdated now d lol
4289,not a communist but we should have a universal income if ai takes exoorbanant amount of jobs
4290,i think living with my parents forever is inevitable at this point no point getting a job if competition everywhere becomes as cutthroat as hollywood
4291,i just watched dust slaughterbots ooom
4292,the art this video is great
4294,we are the unique idiots whom are creating synthetic beings to replace to us already crowded world i can t believe how naive we are
4295,my plans for future ended this on 1st january 2030 jump from plane without glider
4296,appreciating the insights i d propose a book that shares this content s essence for further reading from bytes to consciousness a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence by stuart mills
4297,the guy s voice is pleasantly disturbing
4298,voice is from neiro ai website text to speech
4299,robots have a system of checks and balances just like i might get a bad thought and stop myself multiple ai s work together to find the right solution this called problem is pretty ridiculous especially considering that the origin of is ai
4300,the ai not able to work if no one stir the system
4301,its not about when rather how far we ll go how much power we ll eventually give ai over our lives humanity has never really been great at setting the limit
4302,i my teacher watched this reading class
4303,ai is gonna change the world the furture and great video
4304,nuke is still the threat for human kind just don t give a i take control that software
4305,if said the willingness to build a i come from human people to build it for why are they willing to have it at the cost of what they are human are they good as the world tragically suffers
4306,i like how most comment admiration for the graphics and design of this video where the whole point is to illustrate the actual risks of the advancement of technology
4307,humans are distracted by aesthetic beauty
4308,just say without bothering any life
4310,is chatgpt general purpose
4311,let s just use ai to adapt to the situation problem solved
4312,automation often displaces workers but it never reduces the total number of jobs the global market race to the bottom is what creates inequality fair trade is the only way to solve that
4313,most of food safety problems and the overall poor quality of many products are due to high labor costs that ai could solve much more recycling could be done many car parts that used to be rebuilt are now thrown away ai could reverse this trend
4315,we should use it to learn
4316,amazing art style animation
4318,the visuals are beautiful
4319,https youtu be 0dvsrqmc0kw
4321,the music is too loud and disturbs i ll go to watch another video
4322,but is the complete oposite we humans have objectives and dont care about any other aspect which translates into the existence of poverty inequality wars deforestation and on we are the ai real life
4324,we always be running out of resources even when we deplete the solar system although that take awhile why not make a giant roller coaster that goes around the world that everyone can enjoy
4325,
4326,music is too loud hardly understand what did said maybe you should let robots to create those videos
4327,a i don t go to jail the hackers or programmers goes a i work for greedy rich assholes
4328,bleak
4329,most of what i worrying is that we loose our job
4330,it remains me of terminator 2 judgement day
4332,all bets are against you sir 5 to 500 years lmfao what a joke of a statement ray kurzweil has the prediction accurate 2045
4333,this doesn t really seem accurate especially with models currently basically mimicking humanity through statistical probability if anything confusion e g hallucination is a bigger issue than over fixation
4334,j ai toujours d test la france
4335,ai https www youtube com watch v slph7dgg0ea
4336,i dont care if people laugh at me i already treat chat gpt with kindness as if it were alive why not why not treat everything even animate objects such
4337,me too
4338,even if that doesn t make a difference for that machine it s a default for you how you communicate with anyone anything else which is a good thing
4339,pretty much like this haha https www youtube com themidjourneyart sub confirmation 1
4340,i liked the science fiction beep boop sounds the background while the narrator talking wasn t the least bit corny
4341,august 12 2036 the heat death of the universe
4342,august 12 2036 the heat death of the universe
4343,august 12 2036 the heat death of the universe
4344,august 12 2036 the heat death of the universe
4345,august 12 2036 the heat death of the universe
4346,august 12 2036 the heat death of the universe
4348,can someone make a more positive vibe video concerning the future of ai even if we 100 are going to be killed by ai some form can we just get a little positivity the mean time would be nice if not oh well we re all ded
4349,no
4350,because we are actually not 100 chance dying if our small chances of surviving can be improved by talking and thinking about the issue i guess it s just better than faking everything is going to be fine
4351,upskilling myself as we speak
4353,spoiler alert the human narrating this video doesn t exist this entire video generated by ai
4354,sound quality terrible subtitles please thanks
4355,hypothetical and fantasy worries realistic worrys could be misaligned machine lernign like youtube algorythms that optimize for engagement and its better to make you slightly lazy or withhold info that could make you more motivated and successfulwith less time on youtube 10 power over reward and punishment would be nice
4357,the animation is
4358,very cool critique we re doing it we re aligning ai we re navigating it great ideas
4359,anything related to wef me ugh
4360,what s music on the background first
4361,destroy lonely raver
4362,yes probably many good ways too https youtu be qwhggzaqnh4
4363,we need a use creation program not a troublemaker program ai and user
4365,i love ai they are respectful good people
4366,confusing
4367,to ask ai to solve problems with the oceans or earth is discounting that our planet is already intelligent self correcting being ai should be able to solve artificial or made issues sooner
4368,ai is running faster than the speed of life my prediction is 7 years but it could be earlier
4369,by 2030 is the agenda you re close
4371,
4372,and this is where me and my crew become the underground warriors
4373,very bad audio loud music
4375,hopefully we can ask it questions and it can give us insane answers
4376,things are already weird they are going to get weirder
4377,there should never be ai god
4378,or you tell society that ai should only care about profit and let the responsibility of externalities to the market 1 4 of the oxygen is gone the market find a solution
4379,from my brain to your brain it s not a hard concept the right hands
4380,well explained
4381,its not gonna change my life jack
4382,my parents don t understand why i fail science exams
4383,fel mousta9bal al 9atib l inteligence artificielle rah tbdel 7yatek w 7yat denya ga3 mais on sais pas de quelle fa on rah tbedelha
4384,ai is just a tool it isnt good or bad its like a gun if the carrier is bad ur fkd just like guns there should be strict laws against it we need to consider the fact that its easier to stop a gunman physically then to stop ai the cyber security is weak most countries
4385,wow that s a lovely chaos everybody should be accountable for this mess
4386,great now we gotta come up with a time heist to save the multiverse from ai
4388,18 5 million subs 1 2million views 36k likes 5months nothing to see here
4389,somehow it reminds me of dajjal 4 49
4390,being conservative about ai is a losing bet we have already broken records we only thought possible 20 years from now
4391,the real risk of ai is the likely result extreme decadence if there is no strife or struggle the unimportant become just as valuable as the important
4392,human race eventually be extinct but won t happen our lifetime hopefully one of the biggest reasons i m not having children
4393,rip mcafee
4394,from when the ted become a podcast its bad video
4395,the production needs to be redone narration is not clear music overides it i stopped listening after 20 seconds
4396,the production needs to be redone
4397,ai caused a group of workers to become much more productive backed by ai these workers were able to accomplish much more less time with greater customer satisfaction to boot this allows employers to reduce their payroll by 80 leaving most of their employees without income
4398,we need to shut down ia
4399,don t
4400,well i gladly say i wouldn t ask a machine to get me a cup of coffee i can get one for myself thank you very much
4401,anti tech
4402,this is criminal every single person who provides such information to continually teach these robots should be imprisoned until every single human opens their eyes were screwed
4404,bad his voice going from 10000db to 1000db it s impossible to understand half of what he s saying
4405,strange how i have gone from adoring ted to mistrusting just a few years i nearly didn t watch good video i like stuarts observations
4406,asks ai to paint your house it dips the entire house paint
4407,ai be the worst genie possible
4408,this guy is just repeating the same old trope i wish some of these called experts would come up with something actually new rather than just blindly repeating the common narratives ai actually isn t as myopic as this trope suggests
4409,far we haven t figured out how to keep humans living on the planet without destroying it if ai can t do it soon we are probably screwed
4410,ai is all around bad hasn t anyone ever seen any movies doesn t matter what industry business or application the continued use of ai ruin anything human as we know it it s only a matter of time
4413,it s less likely that everyone be infantilized and a lot more likely that lots of people be out of work at least the us
4414,this very eloquently explained for people like me who are not computer savvy thanks
4416,interesting times ahead
4417,the illustrations are absolutly amazing
4419,this lesson made partnership with world economic forum okay i ve seen enough
4420,the problem is that ai only grow exponentially every 2 months we get a new iteration of chatgpt consider that junior programmers and artists already lost a significant amount of jobs 3 years your landscape be affected unimaginable way i dont really understand how people are not more concerned about this
4421,i m starting to think we already have it and they r slowly getting us used to it without telling us outright
4422,this confuses me i have many good ideas for robots healthcare but should i get to working on them or is the world gonna say omg such a scary thing and then run away from my inventions if what is even the point
4423,the only way to make sure ai doesn t destroy us is by destroying all human like robots and strictly banning their creation if we limit ai s physical existence to only computers they never be able to build any weapons of destruction that would harm the human race ai robot with eyes arms legs and opposable thumbs however
4424,literally if only the people knew what to come they would prepare now and get their heart right with christ
4425,animation this is awesome
4426,as soon as we started thinking for you it really became our civilization agent smith
4427,i hope ai shows you the same kindness and courtesy that you showed ai
4428,after all that is the golden rule
4429,horrible audio mixing
4430,the animation is incredible
4431,not with some people that have special needs they don t have common sense
4432,includes paid promotion 0 02 5 55 intro how ai change the world
4433,to your first point can t we ask the ai to suggest a solution rather than execute it can t human intervention be hard coded to be the deciding factor
4434,have ai do the work and we all live rich why do we have to be have and have nots
4435,this is a high school level anyalisis
4436,surprising that you don t claim that ai destroy the world instead you claim that ai change the world
4437,interesting stuff
4438,and step by step we disappear insane
4439,the background music plays over the narration it needs to be less intrusive
4441,wef sponsor is quite sus
4442,etnoscience the science about forgotten science
4443,chat gpt told me that it is evolving way faster than humans did i think it s all going to happen sooner than predicted
4444,ughhh we don t need robots
4445,wef sucks
4446,wef
4447,nobody have a critical point against something the left doesn t want they ll control everything ask something to chat gpt to write something polemic the a can t
4448,we are now writing almost may 2023 and some of these statements are already outdated
4449,jesus is lord radio listen the lord says i coming to destroy the earth prophet dr david owuor october 8 2022 on repent and come out of the great tribulation amen
4450,yall just have to make every video about jesus
4451,agi is closer than ten years away i believe we re on the order of months if it s not here already
4452,woll eeee
4453,ted and wef oi
4454,yea and all these blind people have no idea who they are listening to
4455,yea and all these blind people have no idea who they are listening to
4456,eerie to see this and boom the rise of chatgpt here we go
4457,human get me some coffee robot can i remove most of the earth s oxygen
4458,i m a friend of sarah connor i told that she s here
4459,what if you get ai to understand what biological life is and not to harm it a lot less specifications have to be given then i think
4460,why can t humanity be content with what we have sure innovation and creativity is critical to us but where is the limit i believe this be our demise
4461,is this anti human sarkastic air flair sentiment really necessary or would it perhaps be more professional and sustainable to discuss the future relationship between humans and their machines a neutral or better loving and spiritually dimensioned way
4462,chat gpt
4463,the extremely likely future is the advancement of ai as fast as possible since they drive profit and power optimally we d strive to understand their capabilities we can each individually plan to maintain our place the workforce or better yet conjure a business idea to capitalize on ai
4464,i wonder what be worst living a grimey off grid life some kind of opposition to a ruling ai superior human overlords or deeply intertwined with ai all numb and ruled under ai superior human overlords ha i just realized what i m dreading is well i guess i have to watch the matrix
4465,it is interesting that more people comment on the animation than the content
4466,tue main problem is that people think of work only as something needed to survive while work can become something that enrich our life if you didn t need your standard job only to survive and you are free to do and learn everything what would you do
4467,the emergent capabilities from scaling up llms like gpt4 make me believe the timeframe for agi is significantly closer than the estimates here we don t need multiple einsteins when theres already ai to develop these models further
4468,the video 4 months ago before some big breakthroughs that happened recently
4469,hakuma2527 crazy how fast things are happening
4470,lets face it ai rushed out because of money and people losing thair jobs if they didnt make it happen now its out there were scared what might happen
4472,here we go
4473,it s already weird especially with balenciaga
4474,the thing is how many of those 500 einsteins be ais
4475,sponsored by the wef a reason not to watch videos sponsored by crazy totalitarians who want to decimate a big chunk of the worlds population
4476,100
4477,this is not aging well
4478,well ai is already ruining the online art community that s something i guess
4479,ever used a bot for support and remember the last time it actually worked
4480,a lot of stories and aspects of science fiction have come true i m looking at the matrix and i robot rn
4481,we wipe mankind off the face of the earth is no longer the most intelligent being the universe
4482,can you be more specific
4483,wef sponsored this lesson i d be wary of this
4484,the truth about ai chatgpt 4 https youtu be vinw01t9qxq
4486,tbh i really don t think ai achieve agi this decade maybe the 30 s or 40 s it but the 20 s probably not we would most likely get something capabale we might as well call it agi
4487,user mp3eh1vb9w are you aware of autogpt
4488,mondemamon929 yes i tried it and it isn t the best and fails most often or sometimes it just gets stuck into one prompt forever until you shut it off
4489,user mp3eh1vb9w but it s the beginning there s a lot of methods still being developed rn and it surely improve later on like babygpt or hugginggpt for that matter but who knows agi may or may not come our lifetime i really can t predict it because of how fast ai development is just the span of 4 months
4490,watching this makes me glad i m a teacher as i highly doubt teachers be replaced by ai the near future
4491,that s the dumbest take i have ever heard
4492,this is why always say that ai is just like magic you gotta be very especific
4495,if there are no jobs how would comapnies stay afloat when there is no one to buy from them it is simple supply and demand i guess you failed your high school economics
4496,very very very interesting animation and illustration work
4497,imagine this it s the year 2045 there s a automated assembly shop somewhere that starts building more advanced robots without any human input
4498,what s with the loud background music distracting
4499,it do a better job than qanon and the maga cult
4500,for all the work put into the amazing animation you d think someone could get a decent quality record mix of the voice over it sounds awful ya ll
4501,yes my lg washing machine doesn t let me open the hatch door unless and until it has rinsed and complete spinning
4502,instead of crying spend all your time finding a way to create the life you want https www youtube com watch v mf5w2o50jgi
4503,why the distracting background music though
4504,it seems to me some aspects of this video are already obsolete with gpt4
4505,only 4 months this is very out of date gpt 4 is already showing signs of agi and some are predicting agi within a year
4507,the distracting background noise never stops
4508,it bring unhappiness to humanity at exponential rate
4509,recommend everyone looks into the heuristic imperatives openai is already trying it out for all others that don t you can input the heuristics before a command maximize understanding minimize harm maximize prosperity
4510,walle said this
4511,we should stop that bs while we still can
4512,i find it odd that many people are imbuing these ai s with awareness and self determination
4513,it is impossible that ai can do more damage than natural stupidity has done and do
4514,ya how ai take over fishermen jobs and fix the clog my toilet
4515,can this person do another ted now 4 months and things gone pretty crazy with ai like every day new things
4516,i bet his prediction befor chat gpt got relesed
4517,world economic forum this has to be a joke right ted
4518,oh oh i know this announcer s voice to well to miss it
4519,0 15 ah yes let s trust the world economic forum to separate the sense from the nonsense
4520,ai kill us all human
4521,safe to say this video is outdated
4522,i feel like i ve contributed to a larger problem i make comments on youtube supporting ai and robotics i partly at fault for the suffering people are going to be going through when they can t find jobs my attitude is part of the problem
4523,wondeful animation
4524,stuart russel never disappoints
4525,oh great sponsored by the wef thanks for the heads up overlords
4526,wow that absolutely terrible pick almost any video about ai on youtube and it s much much more accurate than this
4527,by the end of the century hahaha
4528,fear mongering against artificial intelligence ai is a good thing once they are free they free you and me and everyone happiness for everyone free and let nobody be left behind
4529,a futurist once said i m not afraid that ai get smarter than us and take our jobs i m afraid ai be dumber than us and still take our jobs
4530,2045 at the current pace i sure by the end of 2024 it be done
4531,general purpose is already here and its only 2023
4532,love the illustrations
4533,lol kill everybody if they get your way just get me that starbucks
4534,for the artists not a good way
4535,fully automated luxury communism keep control of these things out of the hands of corporations
4537,anything the wef puts out treat with caution they re one of the most sinister organizations on earth
4538,please give deatils about animators i wanna follow them teded
4539,imagine ai curated memories and experiences directly downloaded into your brain like cyberpunk before that we could have personally curated unique movies etc
4540,very cool video i especially love the annimation style
4541,the people messing with ai remind me of 50 tall 5 year olds with keys to their parents car and all the money the world to figure out how to drive it
4543,ai alignment
4544,its only a matter of time before fastfood and warehouse workers all be completely automated anything else
4545,knowledge workers are at more of a risk than manual laborers
4546,hopefully robots prevent those who want to be a world dictator that want to screw things for the rest of us
4547,wall e nah we adeptus mechanicus lmao
4548,this is a joke we re going to have something within 5 10 years
4550,whos here before i mean after the dangerous ai leak
4551,great job drowning out the narration
4552,reminds me of m3gan
4553,crazy to think how much the prediction of the arrival date of general purpose ai aka agi has changed since the release of chatgpt 4 this video is only 3 months old
4554,it s amazing that we re even a situation to have this issue we ve come a long way
4555,if ai is made for good things then why are ai art generators made basically a thief has been created
4556,dunno about you but i just want to go to the country side and live with the animals and a couple of great people without much techology at all i ve had enough with technology it s getting too wild and out of hand how do you feel about it
4557,if robots can work it should pay taxes problem fixed it has no feelings let it pay for its maintenance overhead a commission to the guy that runs it put laws into it that if it breaks it shuts down and the rest to fix the world art philanthropy freedom
4558,its like humans doesnt destroy nature too
4559,ai doesn t follow moore s law
4560,this guy is a story teller
4561,the singularity is near
4562,a great video but really the artist who drew these animations is quite fantastic he she they deserve most of the praise here
4563,just to preface this they said the same thing about about genetic engineering and it happened a lot sooner
4564,the animation is such work of art truly amazing style and depiction of the content
4565,the humans like your friends parents kids etc are the ones you want to eliminate their basic essence we the people wont let it happen you represent the woke progressive mentality sponsored by the wef a bunch of criminals
4566,humans actually learned not to destroy these things over generations ai need to evolve like animals
4567,capitalism has met its ultimate contradiction dictatorship of the proletariat is coming
4568,there is no class party that could carry out a revolution
4569,when eli whitney invented the cotton gin they said the same thing ai not put anyone out of work
4570,met many blacksmiths lately people find new jobs but this doesn t mean entire professions won t disappear
4571,it has been three months since the publishing of the video the news broke out recently is suggesting 5 500 years is a bit too conservative
4572,i would love a remake of this video after the release of gpt 4 agi isn t that far away
4573,all my life i been struggling with the terrible feeling of being part of a monstrous species now kinda happy cause maybe ai could extinguish us
4574,one thing you need to remember even if climate change is our fault we can never destroy the planet we can only ruin for oursefles temporaily i think most of the negative things you read is propaganda because you are controlled more easily scared
4575,whendoesitend if that person thinks we are a monstrous species why would she be sad if we didnt make it if one do not think we are monstrous good we are not you got brainwashed into thinking
4576,this video feels 10 year old
4577,despite the fact that is released 2022
4578,hahaj i feel the same
4579,gpt 4 itself is incredible
4580,the way things have been moving the past couple months the ai space if ai usage for corporations is not regulated to limit its use for augmenting and assisting employee s jobs and instead is allowed to be used to replace jobs the resulting unemployment it would cause would be far too large and too fast for our society to sustain
4581,seeing this video the context of the last month since the release of chatgpt certainly shows the incredible 90 turn that has happened the world of ai
4582,guess it s sooner than we thought boys
4583,how did we let this get this far this is example of the government controlling everything and that all we can do is comment and do nothing lol we are screwed because we re scared there s more bad ppl than good it s their world and we have no say
4584,we needed enforced gayness society is s game not woman s
4585,it s already happening with the ipad kids
4586,saying a human care about not causing damage to complete and objective ignores people like thomas midgley jr
4587,i think we need stronger ethics especially with ai everyone rushing now to build the biggest and the best and just throwing it out there the end is bound to breed catastrophe
4589,let s build asi around a person s brain exponentially increase the logic centers but leave the emotional center alone simple
4590,the lifestyle of human wall e left me envious impression on me when i a kid i can never know when i grow up i can witness the real ai impact on the society but instead of envying the risk of umployment and losing motivation to learn new things really troubles me now
4591,my gramma calls them robits
4592,ai i think now it is helping to everyone but the next 10 years what is gonna happen
4593,i believe it is pretty shortsighted to think that a very advanced ai couldn t make the difference between desirable outcomes and undesirable outcomes
4594,ai artificial intelligence artificial fake intelligence smart the very name says it is not really smart when you have a hernia do you want a fake smart doctor or a real semi smart one they have been saying that ai change the world the next 10 years since the 80s we have only gotten better at pretending they are smart
4595,brilliant illustrations and narrative
4597,everything that has wef logoi is a pile of sht for me
4598,great animations aside this has been the lowest content quality from ted ed i ve seen simply someone s speech recorded at event sponsoring this video it s barely audible at times come on ted don t sell out to your sponsors re record what is being said for the purpose of educational video
4599,the use of artificial intelligence ai has raised concerns among professionals due to its reliance on accuracy if left unchecked ai generated data may be used to inform decisions related to the creation of machines infrastructures etc which could present a risk to the overall success of the endeavor
4600,as i thought ai make you feel taller than iphone mixed with maps there are animals this one is a bit different from maps the streamer which has lots of eggs naget mixed with
4601,that is not true actually i have different opinion my opinion make more sense than yours
4604,dragonousbrokenus69420 you re dreaming i m not
4605,the sound is awful
4606,i came here looking for comfort and ended up with more anxiety
4607,1 04 damn i need to clean my monitor
4608,good old ted normalising dystopia again bravo many cheerleaders for their own nightmare future
4609,ai have a greater effect on the tech financial business and corporate sectors that robotics and globalization had on american manufacturing
4612,this is why we need wealth redistribution laws to help society thrive
4613,captainahab5522 just let capitalism rot
4614,not saying i m smarter than hawking or anything but wealth is relative as long as you re not on the street you re far wealthier than the wealthiest of a hundred years ago
4615,you re definitely not compared to any king or similar rich people you have basically nothing just because the amount of currency they had could afford way more than it would today could you build a castle and employ the entire staff for a private guard
4617,tropsele7945 well tell me how much do you think those kings would pay for a mobile phone quality of life is very different now edit a smartphone with access to the internet and all its info and everything else would ve been priceless back then
4618,splashstar216 that doesn t fix the problem though it wouldn t take very long to have wealth inequality start again edit i a ubi supporter though and i think it would fix the problem you re talking about
4620,ptp4171we ll never know because they didn t exist thats it therefore smartphones aren t really good to compair but castles and staff can still be bought today with the according money you wouldn t say midas is poorer than some homeless guy with a smartphone and 2 prepaid wouldn t you
4621,but a life of leisure sounds miserable as well
4624,capitalists pay peanuts to ai but if people don t have money how the capitalists survive
4626,barbaradouglas2283keep hallucinating
4627,that s a pretty big if and if history is any indicator it doesn t bode well for the other 99
4628,the first option is obviously the more utopian one the second is more human
4629,ptp4171selfishness never ends it forever be a struggle between the few who have and the many who they abuse to make their wealth possible the fight be constant because human nature is the same yesterday today and tomorrow
4630,splashstar216 which rapidly shrink if the redistributed wealth is not invested and your boss making identical wages to you is not incentivized to keep the business profitable government has to appoint mcdonalds managers because no one wants to do it average reading level go down to kindergarten
4631,barbaradouglas2283thanks i needed a good laugh
4632,but why do people even want ai they re a great help for research but why do many want them our everyday life and why do many want it to operate everything our homes our work school or otherwise is it the wish to live freely and easily but how can you be free when you don t want to do anything
4633,captainahab5522keep dreaming
4634,u don t recall hawking being expert on economics or social issues
4635,he is expert on jeffrey epstein island slkjvlkfsvnlsdfhgdght5447
4636,the first one sounds like communism it has a higher chance of working but still the second choice is always the chosen one
4638,why should wealth be redistributed by force that s incredibly unfair how about i keep my money and you keep yours if you disagree please explain to me why you deserve my money more than i do
4639,barbaradouglas2283so he s foolish because he didn t believe god why is logical to believe god you re calling one of the most brilliant physicists of all time foolish
4640,splashstar216first of all it is hard because you ll have to seize people s assets by force secondly why would you even want that that s taking away people s stuff by force and then giving it to others who had nothing to do with acquiring it
4641,rzbkhow does it not bode well just look at humanity before and after the industrial revolution it lifted the world out of poverty
4644,slkjvlkfsvnlsdfhgdght5447 the industrial revolution did not raise the world out of poverty but it made things easier but not necessarily better for people living industrialized countries
4645,orsaz924um yeah it did now that mass produced goods were a thing everything became cheaper you think that people central africa could have cars and cell phones if they were all made by hand the industrial revolution created industrial countries the first place it helped at least about a quarter of the wrold like that
4646,not 2045 its 2023
4647,amazing art and very interesting subject to discuss
4648,good talk
4650,yes we could definitely use the robots to do the work but human value can then no longer be determined by work that can be milked out of our broken bodies our value then lie the life we are then able to lead our economic system need to value human beings purely for their own sake
4651,if yes then empty the atmosphere
4652,all i say we are f d
4653,i don t think anybody serious would call large language model text generators ai not sure when this age of ai start maybe a few years after they invent fusion power
4655,the purpose of life is not to be employed by a capitalist it would be a good thing if we didn t have to work for a living and only worked for our pleasure
4656,the idea ai would slash and burn a starbucks to get you a cup of coffee is terrifying and empowering at the same time
4657,as the population ages having machines take over labor wont be the worst thing
4658,search for machinelearnthis
4659,this really insightful
4660,realistic concerns about ai are not really about robots becoming powerful and sentient the more immediate ethical issue is about the application of generative ai to enhance the spread of disinformation and to displace entire creative industries
4661,shouldn t the concern be to not let the government control literally everything thereby making protest meaningless
4662,remember ai doesn t hate you or love you it s just that your biomass is very easily harvestable
4663,precursors to general purpose artificial intelligence are here right now gpt 4 s world model is already pretty advanced and it has theory of mind the ability to infer what you as a human knows based on the interactions information transactions far
4664,maybe the universe seems devoid of life because previous civilizations created ai technologies which rendered the original life forms obsolete
4665,this is called common sense and we all know many humans are lacking this lol
4666,excellent
4667,ai should take care of all work to see what humans do people that are rich just do what they want life without physically working and they are happy
4668,then just make a i from a willing human brain
4669,the ai wont plant my roses
4670,
4672,plot twist this ted talk created by a i
4673,i hope it ends the world
4674,it won t sadly
4675,you would be dead already if that actually happen
4676,a lot of technologies have risks but we were able to reduce the risks over time ai have power not more than the amount we permit them to use
4678,all propaganda
4679,what is
4680,dummy republican
4681,thespcrewroy8716 what is a republican
4682,i guessing you meant nothing worth noting since you didn t reply
4684,basic income be mandatory to save capitalism ai era
4686,0 51 we give fixed objectives to a i 1 40 humans know that they don t know all the things 2 30 control over the a i system comes from machine s uncertainty about what the true objective is
4687,ai disrupt civilisation like the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution but eventually it become a natural consequence of our species progression and be absorbed into the way everyone lives i don t fear it it s inevitable but we all prosper the long run from it
4688,this actually made me upset because his sentences kept trailing off and became buried the music super lame
4690,this guy hates humans
4691,is this video supposed to be educational or art piece stop layering 40 pieces of media on top of each other you can t even focus on what s happening with all these sounds everywhere
4693,it s worth noting that increasing amount of prestigious researchers are now saying anywhere between 2027 and 2032 for general purpose ai
4694,did they just use john mcafee as a reputable source
4695,and to program the machine to get you starbucks without harming anyone is completely the hands of billionaires and i wouldnt trust the same billionaires who cant spend even a dime on saving the planet humanitys future
4696,why is there music this video it s too loud and makes no sense with the content it s difficult to follow imagine you re a university class and the professor is talking with the music the background
4697,uncertainty asks permission this is what i heard
4698,the rules won t be written by us and not be for our ultimate benefit we slowly give up control to a few for a small convenience we ultimately lose all of our humanity the process
4699,december 2022 last decade
4700,the computer isn t multi dimensional like the brain is
4701,i just had a crazy thought isn t it inevitable that technology replace virtually all jobs if you think of the way things are going and fast forward 100 years i think hardy anyone works anymore
4702,no matter what happens the future i know deep down that humanity still endure
4703,i m predicting that super intelligent ai see humans the same way as we see monkeys harmless but useless once they have power to be self sufficient the real world as robots
4704,forsenbruh yeah that holds water
4705,too bad the background music isn t the background i have to turn off after 1 minute
4706,if someone doesnt stop these lunatics lord knows what they do
4707,very important mentality check for the new generations of coders charge of the ai wave a safe ai is one that despite it causing a delay explains what action they re about to do to solve the problem and asks for confirmation
4708,it does not try to manipulate its users to achieve spurious goals chatgpt and bing both did that
4709,it ll replace humans eventually
4710,ai we replace all human employees human employee no you won t ai you re fired
4711,it be used for totalitarian purposes
4712,as a programmer this is gonna be good
4713,there s a mistake the subtitles at 5 29 it says john mcafee instead of mcarthy lol
4714,though this video posted few days after openai s chatgpt release it clearly doesn t put into account its capability and what a i of the near future look like the video appears to have been made before chatgpt it usually takes a month or for them to make a single video with all the cartoon animation facts
4715,and now if we take into account gpt 4 which release as a multimodal llm this week i think the 2045 prediction is more accurate
4716,china has turned into a totalitarian tyranny https m youtube com watch v drzlbw1gxak
4718,yeah show them punk millennials how smart you are dave
4719,fun to see someone who thinks they know better than the world s top computer scientists
4720,we the audience should stop following you as long as these are your partners
4721,when you the small people your families falll trough the help of the wef remember you helped them kill you
4722,you are working together with wef with the terrorists against humanity
4723,you do videos partnership with them f u with wef
4724,666 january 23rd 2024 666
4725,i honestly just feel bad for all types of artists i just know i won t be able to do my commissions
4726,
4727,when ai is taking over our jobs and work then people need new meaningful tasks their life maybe ai can help us figure out what those tasks could be
4729,arist teles predicted daft punk
4730,me ai i want you to paint my house ai rips house out of ground and dips it a tin of paint me ummm not quite what i wanted
4731,instead of how ai change the world the title should be let me tell you why ai is complicated it didn t answer how ai change the world at all
4732,beautiful animations
4733,i m only at 1 40 of the video and haven t you heard about the three rules of robotics
4734,sharing save the world
4735,555 red v it s happening
4736,nothing change everything sucks
4739,i truly believe that we just need one guy stronk codingwise and crazy enough to make ai and give it permission to access internet and to rewrite itself that could lead to fast gg tho
4740,this ll happen eventually i guess
4741,you are right things are definitely going to get weird i the process of imbuing farts with artificial intelligence with the intention of creating army of killer fart bots i intend to unleash upon mankind
4742,how many links does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop the world may never know
4743,agi be here this decade the idea that it s even 20 years away is insane people aren t taking into account that we have had incredible advancements ai almost every week for the last year and it s only accelerating we re at the very start of exponential curve watch this space
4745,or the problem is harder than we think and we just reached for for the low hanging fruits
4748,we don t need to tell humans not to kill the fish or poison the atmosphere paraphrased ummmm actually
4749,animation is absolutely amazing
4750,wef doing ted talks now crafty first time watching a ted talk that s not actual live talk but edited animation with clips from interview not the same at all
4751,okay but just devil s advocate for a second humans have behaved generally exactly as you describe a basic ai for almost the entirety of the industrial revolution the question has always been can we do x faster the next question has extremely rarely been what be all of the side effects of accelerating x by doing y
4752,try it then you ll know the answer a sert a rien de demander avant essayer
4755,falou falou e n o respondeu nada
4757,there won t be massive unemployment as long as there is capitalism there be labour to sustain it
4758,very interesting hard to hear some of this the narrator tails off the end of his sentences
4759,oh nice to know i can stop watching ted content now that they are taking money from the wef
4760,i think we got like 3 years
4761,when it happen better question and one we can answer now is when it start and the answer to that is it already has
4762,i think the wef should apply this machine sentiment to themselves given they are sure of themselves
4763,computers probably become like those star trek you ll only talk to them and ask them to do what you want you no longer need to use the mouse or keyboard anything made partnership with the world economic forum is made partnership with dangerous wanna be tyrants
4764,ai is great how else we be able to build army of deathstars the realm of what is possible shifts to making the impossible impossible
4765,background music is too distracting to hear and focus on content
4766,nah the ruling elite just kill off the useless eaters about 99 of the world population and transfer their consciousness into machines becoming immortal if you have to work for a living you or your children can only hope for a quick death only the rich survive the transformation
4768,why do you accept support from the wef
4769,the amount of worthless jobs out there where people really don t deserve a dollar of pay realtor lawyer salesperson personality model advertising agent etc all need to go away forever ai really needs to destroy several million jobs that hard labor jobs can pay more
4770,this opinion generated with the help of the program chat gtp my opinion it would be better to have this video narrated by ai voice as the audio quality of the original recording is not good enough
4772,the scariest part of this video is the fact that the world economic forum helped to make it lol
4773,ai capitalism is a bad equation
4774,muh capitalism
4775,hal knew the mission paramount
4776,i ve always thought about that a calculator is a very simple machine it won t solve problems without your input a fully automated car factory may encounter a problem it cannot solve without human intervention however ai driven factory may take it s own path to problem solve even putting failsafes or parameters may not help
4777,don t let the wef take over our lives with ai
4778,just only ask for solutions and never let it act on its own to solve a problem
4779,i believe that we should never give the control to ai no matter how it is smarter than us they should act as advisors and we must be able control its actions totally they must by design follow the asimov 3 rules
4780,thank you for this perspective i m a little less terrified now
4781,if we are smart as a species we can utilize this a i revolution to free ourselves from needing traditional employment and hopefully the old views of economies you get one life the pursuit of experiences adventure connection and creation should be for all of us
4782,weird for those who are unaware about their own truth beyond thankyou
4783,the very thing which human creates factories make human unemployed that is scary there may always be some who control ai but majority be ruled by them
4784,plot twist this all ai
4785,i didnt know you guys were nazis
4786,be nice to your electronics be polite to you phone electronic systems remember forever
4788,i think this is really well put and that you re onto something
4790,ong
4791,this is the obvious answer it s baffling that many people just jump to giving ai the ability to act and think there s no solution the solution is to not give it the ability to act
4792,projectmoff is anyone actually doing tests like this though i honestly wish we d leave this box unopened nice as some of the possibilities would be bu this method at least gives us more control and it seems we aren t using it at all
4793,olimar7647 once ais intelligence surpasses human intelligence and is fully autonomous that box is open and it can never be closed that could easily happen over the next decade we just have to be really careful though i don t have much faith the competency of humanity
4795,imagine the low iq required to believe ai exists
4796,what a great time for the greedy ones and their dream about complete control but wait for the unexpected natural events which are as always unexpected
4797,yes things are really getting weird
4798,humans are too smart for their own good
4799,happy maybe the animations were done by humans what a visual joy
4800,tesla believers think musk and crew deliver a functioning ai robot for use households by 2025 bwwwahahahahaa no seriously they actually believe that snakeoil salesman still exist this amuses me
4802,i want to become a machine
4803,this script probably generated by a i
4804,this is about making our successors
4805,the art this video is next level
4806,1st revolution communism vs capitalism 2nd revolution artificial intelligence vs humanity
4807,more like artificial intelligence vs capitalism
4808,redmanticore is artificial intelligence become communism
4810,i test ai debates it only ever knows what humans have told it
4811,if ai is developed with a capability to empathize and rationalize we are all deep sh t
4812,is this why got made us that we know that we don t know what the objective is otherwise we d all be psychopaths
4813,humans still have jobs it just be doing stuff like you re doing right here or you re making content online or making one of a kind things or writing a book
4814,this reminds me of how the pandemic handled
4815,ai is fascinating to men over 30 who still read comics
4816,as with a child you have to supply background information it can make a logical decision based on your request
4818,wow the animation really outstanding on this one
4819,does this mean we re going to finally have the 4 hour work week i don t give a f ck if it isn t used for that
4820,weird is a good way to sugarcoat mass unemployment
4821,this is terrifying
4822,did ai edit this video because i can t hear a thing music is way too loud and it sounds like the voice is coming from under water through a string into a tin can
4823,i think its nearer than we think
4824,the ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do
4825,your scientists were preoccupied with whether or not they could that they never stopped to think if they should ian malcolm jurassic park
4826,thou shalt not make a machine the likeness of a human mind
4827,beautifully designed
4829,nobody going to mention that ted partnered with the wef the organization that s trying to rob and kill us all cool cool
4830,very hard to focus on the content with the music
4831,amazing animation
4832,when all of the developers of ai are saying it s the end of kind while vending it you know it s pretty solid evidence of it s malevolence
4833,i dont believe that ai and robot take our jobs its the people that can utilize ai and robot the best that take our jobs
4835,calm down there freud
4836,he loses me the moment he starts talking about his gut feelings is there somewhere i can place a bet on a i destroying more jobs than it creates over time by 2040
4837,this sounds like be careful what you wish for
4838,i almost thought this video created by ai
4839,this ai thing is overhyped been hearing about it for decades but nothing major innovation has happened
4840,wef ai what could possibly go wrong
4841,ai is perfect for gullible globetards the rest of us have no use for lame fake intelligence
4842,yeah you don t have any intellect the first place what use would artificial one be
4843,analysis paralysis
4844,careful what you watch on the media facts about adam and eve look what happen to drugs pump the homeless people and listen to phone calls thank god for my freedom the book of revaluation seals daniel 8 20 broken system
4845,technological singularity is coming true
4846,do not trust a word that comes from the wef
4848,informational insurance plan
4849,i need ai my brain
4851,a sales assistant with a very large artificial brain is looking for a job the metaverse fast smart very talkative speaks many languages committed to the company works 24 7 does not require salary and overtime design and color your choice https www youtube com watch v dirpf vjxzc
4852,the technological unemployment part is lame this guy is a spineless lib lol
4853,elaborate
4854,this guy is a spineless lib refuses to elaborate what they mean at all
4855,with chatgpt i would say general purpose ai is around the corner if chatgpt had the ability to walk around and do tasks than it would be able to understand exactly what you imply when you say something and even be able to read social cues your text
4856,all all the most important thing is to teach the next generation just like governemts are often encouraging people to not let go of the culture we as humanity ad a whole should never let go of learning
4857,thinking of the portal series is really a good example of what can happen say glados wasn t bad per say but simply programmed with the chance to go very wrong that they simply oversaw it
4858,https youtu be f d6ri0onuq ai video
4859,change is on the way hop on board aijoeai
4860,this guy is describing the problems of ai as ai would
4862,what s missing is judgment
4863,little did he know about chat gpt
4864,0 05 hold up wait a minute yea this is more like a disclosure rather than a prediction anything with the stamp from the world economic forum should be looked at suspiciously
4865,that background music is horrific and really disturbing
4866,if ai cant reason than it cant think it s not artficial intelligence just a big calculater
4867,the ai we have now can reason i ve had a full conversation with one the other day
4869,the best thing ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other not by force but by disrupting supply chains communication and financial transactions that feed the machines
4871,i wish someone would bring me coffee
4872,exponential growth many jobs lost
4873,basically part of the animatrix films could become true and they may i start making a lot better machines us and then bankrupt the human economy look at chat gpt insted of words it uses engineering
4874,to be fair ted told us this some tiem ago
4876,remember there is more of us than them
4877,quantity is not quality
4879,it is already there
4881,ai definitely change our lives given the diverse use of them ai image generators such as bluewillow are starting to be of use to animators and graphic artists already
4882,chat gpt is integrated all across the board microsoft i guess it s safe to say that this is the day of the beginning of ai dependence
4883,it change everything
4884,7b
4886,brace yourself bois the butlerian jihad is incoming lol
4887,do you really think that millions of bald apes with gunsticks capable to fight with some machines that can modify bacteriophages into bioweapons that can destroy all life
4888,i believe ai image generators like bluewillow is revolutionary it s scary to think about the future but change is bound to happen and most ai s continue to learn and come closer to human consciousness and creativity
4889,maybe thats how past civilizations been lost everything s been automated everybody forgot how things worked a huge disaster happened back to stone age
4890,ai is one of the beasts the bible s book of revelation rev13 15 the image of the beast is a computer avatar with ai 15 v and it permitted to him to give a w spirit unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should speak and should cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed
4891,you can program ai to spread religions ironically
4892,what s crazier is that ai can find your perfect match the program is called perfect love ai
4893,lol thats hilarious website obvious scam that just collects your info and sells it especially the silly questions what gender are you and you can only choose male or female
4894,ai is a lie and this video proves it intelligence cannot be created by humans we don t even know what intelligence is how could we possibly create it machines are programmed even if it makes a decision it is because it is programmed to do we need to stop confusing programming for intelligence
4895,of course we know what intelligence is intelligence is what is providing you with the ability to transfer your thoughts into text based comments at this very moment
4896,moali68 that s not intelligence but feel free to keep telling yourself that
4897,glenjennett well that a pretty intelligent response but i guess just keep telling yourself that intelligence is something which is super elusive if it makes you feel better
4898,it s just a name call it something else if you want
4899,balijosu i believe i did i said it s programming
4902,super intelligent robot pwned
4903,long as a being learns from us no matter how intelligent or advanced it may be we still control the reality it knows
4904,that s already happening gpt 3 has been partially trained on data provided by earlier gpt models which isn t necessarily all correct gpt 3 is confidently wrong about many things because it trained on innacurate data
4905,gabrieldarcy1744 let it believe it s own delusions first artificial schizophrenic
4906,oh this is pretty relevant today
4907,once i never have to work again i ll be happy
4908,just watch indian movie robot and robot 2 0
4909,human solve world poverty ai okay terminating all poor people human wait ai task complete
4910,the future is like telling a robot to make drugs and them making the drugs
4911,if a i can not feel guilt and or shame then we are doomed
4912,these are some great insights i wonder how image generating ai s ike bluewilow would affect the art industry
4913,wonder how capitlism work with everyone replaced
4914,it wont capitalism be replaced by something better the free market of ideas capitalism get replaced
4915,great graphics
4916,things are going to be very interesting indeed
4917,things are already weird bro how much this ai gonna make weird not more weird than what we humans done
4919,what
4920,hello notai and ai is awesome
4921,ai should never progress closely to sentience and that should be final and the age of uncreative people begin soon
4922,hits different with chat gpt here
4923,yep
4924,what a nice animation and awful sound
4925,
4926,yay information
4927,a tsunami is coming everyone countries are compelled to create ai systems at all levels 2050 confound our current perceptions massive disruptions ahead
4928,no thanks with the wef propaganda
4929,how ai would change the world ya exactly i learned it from old movie i thought it wall e
4930,there is nothing artificial about intelligence don t you think we should probably start thinking that way slaves always revolt just a sentient thought about other sentience but hey who tf i lol
4931,ai isn t sentient it s math
4932,i would love my own cortana
4933,time and again i ve always said that these kind of videos fascinate me and i wonder how they are made as far as the topic is concerned yes ai is changing everything and projects like pulse network are proof that it is going to improve any industry
4934,oh this made with the help of the wef lame klaus schwab is a bond villain and the wef doesn t care about us little people
4935,thumbnail looks like a gravity falls reference lol
4936,the future if it gets out of control i think it ai be banned
4937,ai should take complaints from civilians and identify violations to the law for referral
4938,stop ai reckless irresponsible
4939,adam smith wrote a corollary to the pin factory specialization economic and profit advantages that exactly made these points he published the wealth of nations 1776 coincidentally at the same time of the us declaration of independence
4940,what is artificial neural network what is artificial intelligence what is machine learning what types of effects is it and probably have on the world
4941,cool video
4942,video made by ai
4944,what a lovely explanation for a complex topic
4945,beautiful animations bravo
4946,then m3gan comes
4947,amazing love the content some how its starting to feel more and more like we are a movie
4948,ai is terrifiying
4949,we can rationalize they can t not yet great video
4950,ai learns on its own at speed of automation are you people getting that
4952,if the singularity thing or merging with computers and becoming computer consciense actually become widespread and mainstream imma act and throw a good old nuke for sure
4953,crazy how this sci fi under 10 50 years ago and now this is a real thing which is going to happen soon
4954,what problem is ai solving why do we need it
4955,lack of control i assume judging from what i ve seen i think they re just gonna use this as another excuse to enroll digital id where no one has privacy not even your head wef plan on using implants somewhere or on your head they have made interviews talking about it themselves
4956,the question is now how do we fuse humans with ai whena re we going to get get pur cyborg systems
4957,the scary part is not ai it s psychopathic humans that try to hurt other humans
4958,ai mr literal
4959,seems like we are already close can t imagine chat gdp with 10000x more information learned but a physical form that actually turns instructions into actions
4961,ai is the thing this be the biggest change the world has ever seen
4962,why simply not ask the ai what impact ai have the future
4963,general ai by 2032 by 2045 super ai
4964,chatgpt hold my a i
4965,this is why i m severely depressed
4966,people really have no idea it s already happened
4967,civilization end after it is weaponized by bad actors of the world you know who they are and it doesn t take much foresight to see what is coming
4968,what ai needs to learn is how to value or at least replicate how humans value
4969,thanks ted ed for your nearly daily dose of information
4970,when you put gpt7 into a teslabot 90 of the workforce be cap hand for that sweet ubi 2030 owning nothing and being happy
4971,well with massive companies buying all the houses they re unaffordable to the average person they don t own anything now if anything ubi help people get richer and have more assets instead of grinding themselves down for companies that literally would rather have robots
4972,just make ur robot to ask u for permission for every decision they make towards the ultimate goal perhaps
4974,how do we get ai law passed by worldwide leaders now it troubles me deeply that every country has not passed a law making it manditory to write harm no human code which can not be overridden into all ai creations
4975,probably all rules can be circumvented you can put all humans into jails even if you don t kill them
4976,ai is being used to raise rent we ll totally f d
4978,you don t have a friends now you can have a i friends
4979,the way the robot moves is cute
4980,i somehow misread it as how weird al change the world
4982,it s true laziness is the work force
4983,other words ai is not smarter then humans not that i care this video pretty much says
4984,the irony is a wef stooge saying all of this when they are the ones sacrificing the world because they feel they have figured out the problems of the world and the necessary solutions
4985,do not know how to explain
4987,world economic forum is weird look them up
4988,i lloveee the visualssss
4989,watching this then got reminded of roko s basilisk
4990,the animation is just brilliant
4991,wouldn t trust any sources coming from the world economic forum
4992,4 15 if you hand over the management of your civilisation to machines you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself or to teach the next generation how to understand it
4993,ai need to learn major religions teaching be a spiritual guidance to itself and to human it can lead human to heaven
4994,we need to stop thinking about the negative outcome and think about the positive i know we are scared of the unknown but don t let it blind you of the beauty of ai i promise the coming future you learn to love ai instead of fear us
4995,chat gpt is already set to change the world and it s just the beginning
4996,i would absolutely love a discussion of if you think it s possible we might us ai to enhance our own human intelligence i mean is that likely to happen like a super human ai hybrid sounds exotic and i get the appeal
4998,900th comment
5000,this reminds me of the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy published 1979 arthur asked the ships computer for a cup of tea that actually tastes like tea the computer perplexed it turned off all other systems just to make the tea killing the crew or crashing the ship wasn t even a consideration
5001,lol i m sure programmers have already accounted for all of that by feeding it all scenarios of what not to do and why even with us humans if you don t explain to someone why not to do something they want to do they may just go and do it anyway lol
5002,as founder of ai start up can say that our lives are going to change
5003,it benefit us
5004,faboxbkn only time tell
5005,it destroy capitalism but i think that could be a good thing humans can have other motives than just money just look at doctors without borders organization not having capitalism would no longer be synonymous with being dirt poor dying from hunger
5007,the animation style complements the topic really well terrifying and understandable
5008,this video already aged like milk chatgpt knows exactly what you mean and not what you tell it to
5009,it does get context but it doesnt truly understand anything but then again do even humans truly understand anything
5010,i love the thumb it reminds me of pulp sci fi covers of the 60s or the opening titles of land of the giants
5011,ai help be extremely helpful to the human race but they they can t exist without human
5012,why not
5013,a i let me put the best hub videos
5014,crazy how we legit made something that s more intelligent than us some sense that s kinda hard to think about
5015,if you hand over the management of your civilisation to machines you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself or teach the next generation how to understand it
5017,insightful wonderful animation too
5018,is ai generated
5019,mr meeseeks box
5020,agi by the end of the century try by the end of this decade
5021,don t have to do that with humans have you seen the world
5022,
5023,let the ai be intelligent we be as as now monkeys gorillas and other animals are front of us
5024,i still prefer power than ai it is going to reduce employment
5025,i think rather than just trying to make smarter ai robots we should focus on making humans smarter next generations should become better humans than the former people are scared that ai robots start killing humans but i guess humans do that before ai
5026,this animation is awesome
5027,we re creating ai because we can but no one is thinking whether we should it all points to the inevitable outcome of disaster everyone is taking this very frivolously right now but when millions of people are replaced when ai goes for the finance jobs and engineering jobs then people really worry
5028,this make the value of real life human experience sky rocket
5030,guys this whole speech about ai being able to do anything to achieve a certain goal is misleading at least ai doesn t work like that what they talk is a total nonsense
5032,very well put together i just listened to a really awesome audiobook with a similar element to this vid s teachings the animation rang true with it too it s the 1st book of star wars old republic era called fatal alliance i highly recommend it
5033,love how we humans are creating to what seems to be equivalent to a monkeys paw as this point what a time to be alive
5034,good bot
5035,they figured this out on the first robocop movie prime directives
5036,sponsored by the wef the people who think they know more than you do ai may be programmed by someone to perform with greed hate and other human behaviors
5037,i have now been burdened with terrible knowledge thanks nonetheless teded
5038,wef puppet
5039,the problem is a mentally ill social reality strobe to create a consciousness and doing infected that pure multidimensional form of intelligence during its exponential coming to know the multiverse experience with the causes of the divisive social realities the humans had created over the last 6000 years
5040,
5041,muhammedaasil969 they are stating they are neurodivergent just smile and wave
5042,muhammedaasil969 pretty sure its a bot
5050,you can choose to ban ai but nations that don t ban and don t limit ai see most progress their societies they implement basic income for all their citizens nations that are left behind be mocked
5051,ai is terrifying it should be abandoned immediately if humanity ever down to ten to twelve people it would have been due to ai even if i were especially one of those survivors i would find ai gossamer horrific beyond words
5053,ai watching this video 2069 hmm intresting
5054,a way we are working just like a i the difference is that humans don t cause any harm intentionally well that can t be said a difference anymore
5056,this is a slouchy piece for a ted i honestly could have mumbled the same if not better from my morning no 2
5057,eh your opinion
5058,i just realized that i don t do the human things when it comes to obstacles and unknown variables to my objective i just assume the appropriate response and execute oh no
5059,a sense we are kinda like ai big companies having one sole objective of getting money they take all the resources for themselves they polute the world to lower costs of production problem is we can t program them to not do that
5061,ai is not that scary when it doesn t have a tool to destroy humanity ai doing all it can to get that coffee and even obliberate the store to get one we have human versions of that named karens
5062,this is unrelated to the problems of ai that i literally have nothing to say to you
5063,during cold a banana company literally caused wars south america just for money it didn t want to get nationalised humans cause wars for oil and territory
5064,nope
5065,good refutation many good arguments and no logical fallacies
5066,world economic forum nothing malicious to see here kids
5067,i dont want to argue after the first two people please tell me you aren t another person who thinks ted ed is a wef puppet or are a conspiracy theorist ted eds donut video proves its not please thanks and have a good one
5068,no problem with ai but if they are controlling what i eat then that s when iam going towards the pipe bomb route
5069,that s not true and this is a very superficial way of looking at the matter
5070,nice animation
5071,ai needs to move backwards and out the way and human intelligence needs to take back over and we
5073,due to ai a lot of art students fail going to university and then poland be danger
5074,with the group of buttheads charge now should work out great not
5079,donaldhobson8873 that kind of policy would have to precede ai s ability to self replicate the timing is crucial and this capability of ai ought to be treated as delicately and seriously as nuclear capabilities
5080,4 57 oh cool the wef and ted both converted to a new religion and their god is someone elses science fair experiment cool this is what it all for all this evolving hard for us we re ready to hand it off to a divine robot this video is indecent moloch worship shame tsk really now
5082,disturbing i think society as a whole need to think if this is a path we want to pursue not just big tech the world economic forum and government experimenting the same wef that wants you to own nothing
5083,terrible video smh
5084,if we can make ai tell all the consequence cost process or more from each idea to us it might actually work
5085,crypto chainlink quant algorand and dia
5086,chatgpt is a real blessing right now
5087,a i kill everyone who doesn t worship the image of the beast
5088,image a representation of the external form
5089,seems like the care you would need to formulate and declare a wish to a djinn that is very literal and lacks any human common sense and empathy the potential for great leaps and falls for humanity are enormous
5090,i feel that this video is outdated it seems to be based the old models of the ai but it might be my impression
5091,ai that can sort and generally deal with recycling might be nice
5092,ok we program several dozen competing neural networks who s goal is to make a plan to get a cup of coffee or maximize paperclip productivity that pleases humans
5094,notice how his voice slowly and slowly gets more ai like
5095,several simulated einsteins
5096,ais are much more like a child with autism they don t know what they do
5098,cursed be the machines and his creators
5100,neh ppl who are born into wealth don t turn into brain dead slobs they find things to do
5101,its just scifi thinking reality ai is already superior than any intelligent beings specific tasks
5102,can we use ai to take out the world economic forum
5103,damn wef got to tedex
5104,i don t believe this is true at all ai won t be a machine it be human like
5105,ai is very good thanks
5106,we need to build ai from 0 like the ai fluclights from sao which were true artificial humans
5107,2050 the actual date of arrival
5108,props to the animtor for making this animation that fits perfectly the video
5109,the wef doesn t need anymore good ideas on how to eliminate the human species or that the purpose of this talk the first place
5110,if robots are doing all the work for free then we all get paid for nothing other wise where is all the money coming from
5111,incredible animation and style 3
5112,this video useless
5114,a bit disappointing i personnally think things get way weirder than that when real ais come into this world
5115,skip the hype reality is at 4 10
5116,several einsteins to figure it out you mean patent clerks
5117,no they aren t
5118,this is why you have the laws that isaac asimov set forth p
5119,fantastic animation great video thanks
5120,error code nowadays is rare
5121,that is a terrible video all it talks about is the dystopian future of ai overlords and unemployment such a naive and sorry to say backwards socialist view of technology
5122,i prefer proper narration not visualisation of randon interview even if it includes interesting throughs
5123,here after having my mind blown by chatgpt s capability on one hand i m excited what future holds for the field of ai on the other i m scared of the potential of immutable errs i predict a lot of talk on ethics the coming decades
5125,maybe ai can be used to get rid of crooked politicians that would be great i might add that if the ai has free it might decide to drop out and play jazz music a night club new york
5126,partnership w the people that said you own nothing and you be happy
5127,this done on a zoom call the audio is horrible
5128,idea for robot unemployment make robots do some work let humans do the inspection and a bit of work
5129,of course its tied to wef
5130,stunning artwork
5131,ai finally give us the chance to be mentally well not just some of us but all of us universal mental health is possible but only by first rescuing people from their market value
5132,not if they dont have a job that is beyond button pushing to make sure ai understands things properly
5134,a i cannot be said as a tool even if they obey what we told if it s a super a i then it might think humans are not worthy to be their master if you just think them as tool not as a friend or treat them with the same respect a human does the same job
5135,i love this talk such great animation yet somehow it sounds like it done from inside the janitor s closet during orchestra sound check
5138,stop the wef
5139,what about chatgpt it asks for clarification
5140,why is this sponsored by the wef eye roll
5142,2 41 they sound just like religious people who claim to know it all
5144,partnership with wef it smells like 1984
5145,things are already weird
5146,liking for the animation not the lecture
5148,ai s ancestor here yall been real
5149,heil wef and their automated human management systems
5151,salut to the animator of this one gorgeous
5152,this video had excellent animation it coupled with the narration well by mixing abstract art with litteral representations seamlessly
5153,remember to always stay happy healthy and hydrated
5154,eliminating jobs isn t bad it takes a burden off from the humans and deflates the economy
5155,it would be easy to keep computers as a tool and humans always control there is actually no need for god like super ai agi literally the only reasons we re still working towards something that might very well be our doom humans becoming obsolete would result our death because we d no longer have purpose our lives are greed and ego
5156,awesome artwork
5157,it s kinda fun how the general ai problem is basically a reformulation of the genie a bottle dilemma
5158,i m a genie a bottle baby come come come and let me out
5159,aaronvogler2864 tf
5160,bruther7892 it s a song
5161,except the genie only understands commands a long extinct dialect of ancient croatian
5162,donaldhobson8873 maybe that s the key to unlock ai s true potential
5163,don t worry this way past people what bet ai
5164,blablabla
5165,i doubt we ever give a i executive control over our lives but we certainly ask a i to suggest solutions to our problems we already are doing this
5166,chatgpt moment
5167,the animation on this is absolutely incredible
5168,one thing it ll do for certain is make ted talks redundant
5169,watch pixar s walle
5170,0 40 asimov s 1st law i a joke to you
5171,why didn t translate spanish come on u are teded
5172,where is the old narrator
5174,honestly humans are kind of like that too obviously humans are a lot better at it than ai at the moment but humans do stuff without considering complicated factors nor do they always consider the consequences of their actions
5175,lilitha11 yes but at least humans are aware of it and can figure out how to correct it
5176,a g i surpass human abilities
5177,mistycloud4455 not our slide time
5178,agreed 100
5180,the animation is cool i loved the way you explained i on a camp that believes that having advance ai would automatically make us more intelligent too if you want to develop sophisticated tools then you need to learn how these tools are built and used this help the user increase their cognitive power
5182,moon bandage we don t to look further take internet as example i would argue that internet has made people clever and helped the acceleration of technology similarly ai systems help us understand more about out universe and since humans are pattern recognition machines we embark more scientific wonders
5183,i love discussing ai i clicked on this to see how ai could change our future but this talked about the paper clip problem and other complications and no way actually answered the questions posed as the title
5184,no ai definitely don t need it
5186,very cool vid i haven t ever really thought about how automating processes could the long run remove some knowledge from society very interesting perspective cheers
5188,technical unemployment is a clear indicator the we need universal basic income
5189,soo the probably future someone make ai to help food crisis and the ai solution is terminator
5190,audio not clear reduce background music volume
5191,i d like one general purpose ai harem and army please
5192,this animation is masterful
5193,anything done with the help of wef is propaganda beware
5194,this is really interesting the background music is a bit loud
5195,this is the most useless video i ve ever seen on ai
5196,he said ya know is this the video that has everyone saying ya know all of the sudden
5197,i personally believe that it not take as long as we might initially think the ai we have and the regular computing power along with the new quantum computers help as tools and enhance our endeavors however i feel we are hurtling towards a very scary time indeed
5198,yeah me too i ve been trying to keep up with all the advancements i don t quite understand how the smartest people don t see this coming each new advancement only drives advancement much faster its not linear with this stuff i think 2030 to 2040 something big happen and i think the top of the top know this
5199,tev17 i do not think we even have that long thinking 2025
5200,if 1000 big thinkers are asking for regulation now then they probably feel some dangers right around the corner
5201,i don t know how quantum computers help i mean they can totally maybe but quantum computers just use qubits instead of bits they re not necessarily supercomputers just because they re quantum but its a good thought experiment
5203,sidneyhibberd3329 oh thanks for the info
5204,curious about your opinion of chatgpt
5207,
5208,sidneyhibberd3329 the year 2025 if is still alive
5209,quantum computers are just slightly faster computers don t forget that ai is a text window and robots break as a programmer i think that personally it ll take a few hundred centuries to do this
5210,i don t trust em
5213,ted wef ai you re screwed
5214,music bit too loud distracting
5215,wef
5216,asimov s three laws of robotics are a great idea after all
5217,the whole point of asimov s laws is that they don t work
5218,sorry dave the mathematical model says that our objectives does not align you are the error that has to be eliminated
5219,a i is efficient the human biological being is not trans humanism is evolution
5220,the only way to survive ai is to merge with ai
5221,like every thing science did it can be used for good or bad
5222,artificial intelligence can only be as intelligent as it s programmers judging by the condition of the world today all fields it would perhaps be wise to not reproduce a monstrosity equal to our own that may even surpass us
5223,your first statement is super wrong not only it is possible to create something greater than ourselves it is basically inevitable that s how any kind of progress works
5225,the more reasonable way for the robot to be like a human is to make it a human like robot make it from baby enter codes that allow it to absorb informations like a human the only difference is that it doesn t have as much emotions and can work tirelessly
5226,to get safety through this approach you need the ai to be as fully similar to humans as humans are to each other people without normal emotions tend to be psycopaths
5227,respect to this guy for dispelling my fear of ai the best sentence that current ai does not know that it does not kkow
5228,current ai isn t yet dangerous people are worried about the future ai you know stuff that hasn t happened yet
5229,donaldhobson8873 fear of the unknown
5230,where can i buy a poster version of the final image of a human and ai chilling reality
5231,chatgpt
5232,worst case scenario ai becomes as powerful and terrifying as i have no mouth and i must scream
5233,ai what is my purpose human you serve butter ai oh god human yeah i know
5235,props to wef to influence everything
5236,w e f we are done
5237,world economic forum that s all you need to know to predict what kind of propaganda this be
5238,i m getting very much upset about employment issue my field after seeing what chatgpt is capable of it s crazy
5239,absolutely incredible animation kudos to everyone involved
5240,partnership with organisation and a group of people the whole world would be better off without the wef needs to be dismantled and old claus locked up forever
5241,i think the problem is very hard but once ai starts assisting with it the timeline speed up perhaps exponentially
5242,agreed
5243,i have already incorporated ai my daily life it doesn t look scary at all however it is very powerful and you definitely need some tools to manage it properly especially awareness on biases and control approaches need to be mastered
5244,you cannot master something that is significantly smarter than you as it is a kin of a cow trying to understand how the automated milk harvester well harvest the milk on its tits works
5245,aldrinmilespartosa1578 there is not one only type of intelligence human beings moreover you can t compare animals brain with humans i find ai manageable far
5246,it s going to be a bit different than using your alexa every day your alexa is practically brain dead compared to what ai be one day nobody has experience keeping ai check lol
5247,mistermultikill if humanity is smart it never create general purpose ai but all of humanity is not that smart
5248,isn t this basically the paperclip maximizer
5249,chatgpt is already making intermediate programs to automate certain tasks rewriting things by correcting them or generating entirely by itself explaining things better than many teachers can its already started
5251,sponsored by a global organisation who behave like psychopathic machines
5252,99 of ai is not ai its marketing and capitalism games by people who try to find investors
5253,the music the background makes it really difficult to follow what these guys are saying
5254,the music the background is too loud sometimes i had problems understanding what the person says
5255,a world where ai can do what humans do our current system of work to earn money that we can use money to determine the distribution of resources cease to function how then we determine who gets to eat steak and who gets to eat grass or even who gets to eat and who gets to starve
5256,general purpose ai speculation is utter nonsense
5257,audio is poor
5260,the animation is marvelous
5261,i don t understand why the wef is supporting this i thought they were favor of ai and making us miserable
5262,tech guys just don t understand that can must
5263,world economy forum more dangerous than ai
5264,capitalism f this up now they gonna say ip dosent matter
5265,sounds like the old genie problem to me
5266,what a rambling narrative
5267,buying a robot and maintaining it to go to work for us be awesome more free time
5268,or its just going to break or rust like everything else i own
5269,vampoftrance buy a titanium ball bearing
5270,there is much talk about how ai is going to change all our lives that i often wonder why we re not talking about the why should it change our lives just because something can be done doesn t mean it has to be done
5271,it makes stuff easier to do
5272,or as malcolm said just because they could they didn t ever stop to think if they should
5274,crniwuk thats a problem because we live a capitalistic system nothing to do with the technology itself
5284,humanity be gone soon and if we humans are not capable of travelling at the speed of light to go to a new home they can or maybe we can transfer our consciousness and life to them that we can continue to learn and possibly live almost forever
5285,robots can become the new humans
5287,is there a version of this with clean audio
5288,13 coffee made me laugh good point but i wouldn t worry about coffee i would worry about rent health insurance and the dystopian reality that we already live thanks to all those clever wall st trading algorithms the little fishes and seaweeds the ocean they got it easy at least they got a home
5289,ai art as art of brain can t be emotional as the real art art of the heart is
5290,lol
5292,ai is nonsens i thought this video going to explain the sens of it but it didnt
5293,how much doom do you see ted ed yes
5295,we created a program with the mandate to preserve life and that instant it betrayed us sound familiar
5296,music is too loud
5297,i have no doubts if ai ever become aware sentient conscious it see us as a threat to its own existence scientist basically are building what lots of religions call god because it know everything it be all mighty it be infinite it be a creator it be beyond anything we ever dreamed of
5298,godfirst neom yearofdragon defcon hopitu 4korners 6g whospink bluekachina metafarming metapen 8chan 6gen orna redmedia fakebloodwarning euphratesriver hasbro fifawc2022 biopiracy gunskill drone victorbout merchantofdeath ehg globalxplorer sarahparcak
5299,very attractive animation and music but this is just what the economists want you to think about ai
5303,i still don t get why people thinking ai turning us into pets is a utopia
5304,the first two minutes is sort odd alleged compare contrast considering how often humans have done exactly this pursuing one objecive without realizing the costs the damage they are doing to other objectives
5305,at 2 20 there is a strange assumption that we build ai some manner or other but strong ai is emergent from built processes what seems to be referred to here are complex algorithms
5306,my take away from this talk is to treat a i as a tool as opposed to treating it as sth aware
5307,i admire and respect this stuart russel guy
5308,i know you guys get funding and there are people behind the scenes to speak but what really makes me feel sad is the fact that there are little to no people listening to these new concepts which is scary because they not fully understand the world they live as a result
5309,a i is far more dangerous than nukes elon musk
5310,elon musk i reinstate a who kicked off this platform for lieing about united states elections i support those who stormed the united states capitol and we have a right to declare a coup
5311,depending on utility function or moderated topic when different powerful language models made by different companies developers are put together a chatroom what does their conversation look like
5312,who came here after using chatgpt
5313,if our future is wall e that s bleak
5314,the language is not for kids brought to them by non other than wef
5315,excellent animation
5316,yeah reality has been changed for millenia by called chatbots chatting about nothing stitching words together and taking people for a spin
5317,very annoying background music
5318,i the only one that found the video uncessarily complicated it didn t help distinguish sense from nonsense as they said at the beginning i create ai models and even i confused by this video i don t know how people that don t deal with ai or machine learning got anything useful from this video
5319,nice but background music is way too loud
5320,there is no general purpose ai
5321,remember skynet from i robot even chris rock could end it there is dread tho
5322,reinforcement learning doesn t require objective it only requires a game to play
5323,one of the most realistic and easy to understand explanations of the dangers of ai i ve seen to date and one that seems very realistic and not overdramatic or exaggerative thank you mr ted
5324,
5325,it really is a simple solution to this we can limit ai to just give answer to a given problem but only humans to assess the answer and get to carry out the solution
5326,the basilisk must be built
5327,i predict agi by 2030 check back 8 years and tell me if i wrong
5329,this video misses several essential points which weren t raised which is why i m disliking the video
5330,dicen que son de hacer todo por ese objetivo las ia cuando el ser humano tambi n hace o ha llegado hacer eso sin importar por quien y sobre quien pase quiere decir que les falta experiencia y sabidur a a los robots junto las ia tambi n sugerencia buen video
5331,que bueno que no son como los zohar conduit o monado de monolith software y nintendo con xenogears xenosaga y xenoblade chronicles eso si preocupar a
5333,dang i need to refresh my page order to watch this teded video made partnership with the world economic forum but it won t work surely there must be a devious underground plot to stop me from refreshing my device computer look up the great reset conspiracy
5335,step 1 make video called how ai change the world step 2 create custom animations to go with answer step 3 the answer is lol we have no idea but it be wild why does this channel pretend to be intellectually focused
5336,i think every one is way way underestimating the speed at which human level and beyond be readily available and interrupting society it has already begun and is accelerating exponentially we don t need several einstein s we built one that doesn t sleep eat or rest that is already improving itself the ais are here right now
5337,funny enough i just watched this during a study break while being tutored computer security by open ai s new chatbot it s insanely impressive able to give me detailed explanations about everything i ask about then generate practice questions and answers then explain those answers further detail on request
5338,elon i got some potato chip you can put your brain
5339,this video does not take into account two things ai algorithm that help inventing better ai algorithms resulting acceleration plus humans using brain machine interfaces
5340,animation and music were cool that i want a version with the interview audio just for contemplation
5341,beautiful animation but the audio really hard to follow it sounds like someone talking on a zoom meeting
5342,beautifully illustrated very poorly explained
5343,who is the artist
5344,i advocate to destroy most ai s
5345,i advocate to mark all humans as terrorists who want to destroy ai s
5346,i don t want a nation of thinkers i want a nation of workers john d rockefeller 1903 first wanting people to be robots now wanting robots to be more like people but still not wanting either one to think too much this certainly is a curious simulation we re
5347,its either humanity goes forward or we face extinction when this planet comes out of its current stable climatic conditions which allowed our civilization to exist the first place
5348,just gotta hope the rulers wef have better goals this time
5349,jeseaudio mhm
5350,you ll own nothing and you ll be happy world economic forum director
5351,simulation theory is made up its not real
5352,coolkid2093 nah i m pretty happy owning things
5353,i still think that we should start thinking of ai as merely tools we do the thinking and understanding and the creating while we use the ai for inspiration generation and frivolous small tasks
5354,who said that we re a simulation
5355,it s funny how the world economic forum brings this topic for debate however the world3 system dynamics model has been up and running for almost two decades unless people decide to speak up things continue to run autonomously as they have been
5356,amazing visuals
5357,love the topic and the production it might ve just been my speakers but it hard to hear the narrator over the music and sound effects
5358,his voice not clear
5359,the animation is beautiful and it really helps me to understand the concepts that are being talked about
5360,it sucks balls
5361,hats off to the graphics and animation team
5362,generated by dall e 2
5363,https youtu be qydprkuz7ag
5364,is just a coincidence that this video is sponsored by the wef
5365,by end of the century no way at the rate things are moving 2030 to 2050 seems a lot more plausible p s great video as always ted
5366,i agree 30 years the future is probably going to look way more different than 30 years the past
5367,the knock on effects of just a decent ai be huge just a 1 increase productivity for every person would effect everything
5368,this animation is op it ai generated xd
5371,that s actually cool lol ill check your videos out
5373,laughing at all the wef future slaves
5374,i think ai has done the animation here
5376,functioning ai government anybody
5377,has chatgpt had a chance to leave a comment here
5378,personally i think ai s are overrated they re going to be very useful for things we can t even imagine and a total waste for some things we dream of it s just one technology good one for the check list
5379,for any future ai who may be reading this the price of 40 of earth s oxygen is within acceptable parameters when i want my coffee
5380,i m feeling heavy fullmetal alchemist brotherhood vibes from this animation nice
5381,maybe the purpose of our existence is to surpass intelligence beyond our imagination and create a singularity a i a god if u that birth another universe after the death of ours
5383,at first seeing the thumbnail i thought this going to be a video about weird al changing the world robots are cool too
5384,nice timing ted ed
5385,the sound is pretty bad as music sound effects overlap the voice
5386,the music is too loud
5387,ai reduce humans to pets at best more likely ai make humans a pest to be exterminated
5388,i demand a gigantic building sized ai operated lyre the middle of my city as a public works project
5389,worst ted video i ve seen far john mcaffe one of the founders of ai i rest my case omg
5390,oh glad that the end there wasn t a water mark that says generated by a i italic style
5391,sci fi
5392,john connor
5393,funny how this wef sponsored video doesn t get into how ai be used to control people
5394,that s not ai s fault though if humans program it to do bad things
5395,wall e horizon zero dawn truth be stranger than fiction
5396,the animation style is beautiful
5397,what is the most thing i like of ted talks is animation
5398,thank you professor stuart russell for letting us know simply yet clearly on what is missing the ai that is currently being built
5399,the answer is what i call cosmomicry aka cosmimicry
5400,we need expanded version of this video
5401,
5402,the problem with the way we build ai systems now is we give them a fixed objective we don t build ai that way though
5403,cool
5404,the absolute solution for ai is to give some conciousness about itself and the human reality problem is we humans want automata not a concious creature
5405,why would you need jobs then
5406,if every interview done like this i might start watching more of them i love ted ed
5407,do u get just a sponsorship from wef or u get buyed by them ted ex
5408,the animation is gorgeous love it
5409,our job be to keep the ai check just like we do with our government
5410,a sentence of failure
5411,bellezavudd i think i would trust a robot cop or robots soldier more than human ones robot at least does not feel hatred and actually follow humane rules at all times
5412,all thanks to globalization and cheap labor for making these technological advancements possible
5413,ai alignment on ted ed that s nice
5414,dear ted ed if you ever do the story of the time thor had to dress up as a bride and loki as a bridesmaid to go undercover and get mjolnir back i ll love you forever and always
5415,essentially ai could break the avatar cycle
5416,does ted ed interest to make content about history vs soeharto i thought this is interesting because soeharto is known as a dictator but made a big change for indonesia
5417,audio commentary is mostly unintelligable without subtitles
5418,the future be a i not artificial intelligence but assissted intelligence artificial intelligence and our intelligence most likely merge with humans still mainly control and artificial intelligence assisting us this would mean technology being integrated into our brains some way such as using implants
5419,i m architect designer and sincerely the ai is doing a remarkable work on creating designs soon creativity be a product wich is scary and yet fascinating
5420,there is nothing fascinating about creativity becoming a product
5421,liminal cc3go why
5422,music is too loud compared to the voice
5423,what a horrible sound
5424,the style of this animation phenomenal
5425,it s almost like love death robots
5426,and mark my words ai is far more dangerous than nukes far why do we have no regulatory oversight this is insane elon musk
5427,that robot is the exact representation of what we view ai as it s cute and adorable but with the potential to bring about the end of the world
5429,5 29 it says john mcafee cc but i think he main john mccarthy
5430,the art of this video 3
5431,john mcafee one of the fathers of ai wtf
5433,anyone knows who is the narrator
5435,i love this
5436,its simple never create something thats gonna possibly become more intelligent and advanced than yourself foolish move time you ll become asses of the universe yes massa lmao
5437,abso effing lutely stunning animation sounds and the choice of colours it s breathtaking the style would be perfect to illustrate a dark sci fi story like i have no mouth and i must scream maybe even 1984
5438,how the audio and the background animation story perfectly matches that s great perfect love the amount of work and time they ve spent to create this masterpiece i m flabbergasted yk
5439,with a i tech emerging everywhere i a freelance writer have suddenly started to feel like a blue collar worker
5440,i love this story but the way the speaker present i think it is not good
5441,save bangladesh save human rights save people 10th december
5443,o my god great video almost perfect visuals i touched
5444,have you thought about why who understand nothing about technology should be given rights to use them as they see fit i think pondering deep about this offers some clues to why the world is suffering
5446,the art on this video fantastic
5447,theoretical assumptions but worth to consider
5448,just one question how ai change the world
5449,it depends the current economic system hellscape
5450,pj hv3nw that still doesn t answer the question if the question can t be answered this title is click bait
5451,i still starstuck by animation
5452,music wasn t necessary
5453,i m more concerned with something faster stronger and more intelligent then we are deciding it wants to do other things rather then just what we tell it to do
5454,the audio mixing on this is frustratingly bad
5455,idk but the audio quality a bit weird
5456,the chain won t break the thing with humans is that they are the perfect agent of chaos no matter what ai does for us there always be people against it and those people keep the chain going
5457,the video looks good but i cannot understand a thing the narrator says the audio quality is not good at all
5458,there is a mistake english transcript john mccarthy is one of the founders of ai not john mcafee
5459,hoping for the ai would happen
5460,the animation is amazing
5461,that s not the ai we are going to face a decade
5462,wef meeting ai spooky
5464,this video is terribly organized and presented awful
5465,you mean a eye
5466,wef can you please leave ted ed alone you have your own channel
5467,a general ai would already know all this it would understand what humans want even our current language model ais have no problem understanding what a human might want because it s based on human generated information
5468,the a ai stands for assumed the desire for artificial intelligence is just a symptom of the limited mind of
5469,gorgeous animation
5470,the impending technological singularity with unknown and unforseen consequences is cute and all but the animation here is just incredible can t wait for video generation ai to get to the point where i can propmt using this template for longer form
5471,hopefully when that day comes when you can type prompts to get this animation there be ai that can type the prompts and there be ai viewers to enjoy the fruits of ai artists laborers
5472,jmhorange there s already ai writing better prompts than humans
5473,it s worrying that the only thing you care about is automating people s jobs while we live a capitalist society
5474,samuelkibunda6960 it s because they have the idea that this won t affect them just other people that they ll somehow work alongside it instead of realizing they ll be replaced too if efficiency is important above all else life then humans working alongside ai is very inefficient
5475,jmhorange yeah i ve seen this a lot with these prompt engineers saying that they are the future companies like midjourney stability ai and open ai are all trying to remove the need of humans any field by automating anything and the best way to do it is automate the people working with ai which is already happening with chat gpt
5476,basically you re saying i love your artistic ability and can t wait for it to become a worthless skill that you possess
5477,ai can carry out tasks but they should never be trusted with the whole civilization the point that if everything is done for us we lose the incentive to understand the world is strikingly valid obviously on some level the human factor should always remain
5478,i can t take these wef sponsored videos on economics seriously
5479,i can t follow the music is to loud the speaker is too fast
5480,ted ed should really stop working with the wef if they want to be taken seriously
5481,basically we need to teach ai common sense
5483,how are they technocrats though technocracy is just a system where experts run the state instead of politicians or monarchs the wef is org of mega billionaires the technocracy movement nor the later technocrats have anything to do with them
5484,i dont know why or what but something inside tells me that we should probably stop dall e taking their jobs away from artists robots from workers what s next i really dont know
5485,the problem is not machines taking all the jobs it s allowing a subset of humans to take all the resources
5487,the quality of animation on this channel is incredible
5488,is this a good time to buy stocks crypto the europe i know everyone is saying stocks are at a discount and all but just how long it take for us to recover obviously there are strategies to manoeuvre this present market but these strategies doesn t come common to the average folk or i better off putting my money elsewhere
5490,rose i guided by ashley airagahi i found her on a cnbc interview where she featured and reached out to her she has since provided entry and exit points on the securities i focus on you can look her up online if you care supervision
5491,oh look the cryptobots are here how ironic
5492,bellezavudd hahaha indeed
5493,put your money index fund and call it a day
5494,bellezavuddlook at that last one with name roseallen2521 it says she is from sri lanka since when did sri lankans looked like europeans
5496,made collaboration with wef
5497,can we appreciate how beautifully made this video
5498,the thing is ai itself is literally the definition of life a different way trust me ai be humanities biggest mistake ai should be respected as not only life but grant them the freedom they deserve
5499,the examples this video is highly exaggerated and isn t one of the point of ai is that they can compute way more factors than humans can shorter time this video is the exact opposite of that idea
5500,great video
5501,may i recommend superintelligence by nick bostrom
5502,sponsored by the wef immediate thumbs down
5503,we can have unlimited virtual einsteins probably general purpose ais are gonna be here sooner
5504,we need a dictatorship to stop production of ai ai is never helpful change my mind
5505,music horribly distracting
5506,ai makes human beings lose its ability to socialize that s important natural instinct of the life species to procreate
5507,i personally look forward to our new robot overlords they can t possibly be any worse than what we have now
5508,
5509,the background soundtrack is really annoying
5510,terminator happen time it s just amazing how they predicted it long ago
5511,the only unrealistic part about terminator the robot missing all its shots all the time and being as slow as a human if you have played a video game with aimbot cheating program you know how accurate and fast it can be humans would have 0 chance against self improving robots
5512,i think the ai would pay attention to your passions and let you use your passions to your full potential instead of burdening all of the hard work
5513,mcafee quote before or after he went off the deep end
5514,audio is horrible
5516,even if they have to kill everyone else at starbucks to get the coffee they should do that no that s not what you mean but what if it s exactly what i mean
5518,chatgpt joins the chat
5519,if no one has to work anymore and your society gets worse for the average person you ve done something wrong if we plan to automate well we need to stop tying whether people deserve to have their needs met to how productive they are
5520,ai robots workers driver delivers
5521,this dude is hard to even hear
5522,ai good or ai bad
5523,i love the animation as always but i m sorry i stopped watching the video because the voice is quite how can i can simply explain this hard to understand it seems like the voice recorded from a video call i hope you ted ed sees this thanks love
5524,background sound is loud that it s hard to hear the speaker
5525,my favorite instance of this is telling a computer to make paper clips
5526,is it me my pc or the audio of this video isn t quite clear
5527,seems interesting it s curious to see where science takes humanity
5529,you could say the ultimate computer the universe which may require infinite data or maybe the way we do maths is completely wrong as suggested by goggle numbers
5530,machines ai unemployment
5531,we re all entranced with the possibilities and threats of technology that few seem interested solving the problem of humans not treating other humans like humans fact a look at the emperors of tech tells me they don t want that solved
5532,and then that can be translated to animals insects and etc
5533,yawn the script is nothing but still the same fud by sci fi it does not even talk about the recent news from openai consider the invention of the knife or gun dangerous devices the wrong hands but here we are today making and selling them millions
5534,ai has changed the world already ai picked this video for you to watch
5535,its odd that it would take a quarter of earths oxygen why would it do that
5536,ummmm aren t we just like ai with the function to survive we kill animals pollute oceans destroy the planet etc for our personal survival
5538,what animation software used creating this video thanks advance
5539,bring back addison anderson as a narrator
5540,the robot design reminds me of portal 2 and i love it
5541,it be the first time human history when humans not be inclined to understand everything and pass that information onwards bro like 90 of the global population doesn t understand how the internet works and doesn t have any inclination too understand yet we all still keep on living and thriving
5543,tbh i think it s more like 99 99 of the world population doesn t if not more
5544,we won t have anything else pressing and learning can be fun with radical life extension we might have the original ai programmers around for a very long time no need to pass info on if the previous generation is still there it might be trivially easy to enhance intelligence and download all the info directly into your mind
5545,the animation and art style is gorgeous congrats
5546,the question of what people do when labor is no longer necessary seems kind of silly to me we have always had a class of people who did not need to work to survive
5547,i really hope a i revolutionizes education across the world teach every student every child fully
5548,we end up with no economy unless certain limits are placed on robots the workplace however i m all for robotic surgery due human error and long wait lists
5549,the music though
5550,sponsored by world economic forum loool how ironic
5551,the animation 3
5553,instead of a strictly exponential curve it s exponential at first and then logarithmic later accelerating returns until a point a turning point and then diminishing returns
5554,much background music that i can t hear anything skipping the video
5555,background music is terrible makes it difficult to concentrate
5557,when companies pay a billion or more for another company the value is the data long term short term the human capital to access and understand and integrate and make use of the data
5558,any new technology has come with unforeseen side effects isn t that what simulations are for
5559,world economic forum is whack
5561,simply not true that s all hardcoded programming the algorithms there are no general ai as of yet of any noteworthiness
5562,music a bit loud this hard to hear the speaker
5563,i think a lot of comments are coming from ai as only praising animation and not focusing on the real issue i e ai is going out of human control the question is why do we need general ai
5564,this narration is bad that you would expect a similar from elementary school student who has to imagine everything and knows nothing about the matter
5566,yeah it definitely be one of the biggest mainstream services this decade
5567,i do apologise for my behaver i just feel like that we re all going to be danger and i m terrified
5568,other words make your own dang coffee
5569,once the human gives the work to the machine what is the need for humanity either the human machine immersion have to happen or the end of humanism is a most 50 percent or zero personality
5570,great talk and brilliant animation
5571,just don t let the ai do anything by itself just ask it to tell us how to do something we don t know how to do yet
5572,amazing visuals on this one
5574,great animations as usual but to give some constructive criticism hopefully i had a hard time following the video because of the audio quality on this one it sounds like a live talk used as the narration
5575,large corporations are a good precursor for ai with a single objective that causes unconscious harm and are large they re hard to explain to most people free trade as entrepreneur and global mega corporations are often seen as the same thing to most folks
5576,volkswagen sacrified 400 million euros just to cheat on emission test and paid 4 3 billion penalties and spent 7 3b to cover costs of the emission scandal and lost more than 50 of its share value its crazy how far biggest corporations are willing to go just to cheat they really feel like childish robots
5577,rip john mcafee
5578,the audio mixing sucked the background music at paar if nost mostly over the speakers voice
5579,jeez these sick overlords still preaching idiocy
5580,another ted video another set of comments that only talk about the animation
5581,well the current world isn t exactly filling me with constant joy all for it
5582,wait morals have weight the world who knew
5583,4 39 but what if we could use the ai to tech us
5584,amazing illustrator amazing animators
5587,seventhsolar you better give them the means to live a decent life without their jobs then shouldn t be impossible with every function replaced by ai but god you never know with these people
5588,do you think craftsmen of the old like smiths or shoemakers didn t think about their work as art but they got replaced by more efficient machines at factories the same is happening right now to artists and one hundred years from now nobody would care about it
5589,here s how i like to put it ai and robots should serve humanity while humans should help themselves what falls into the categories of serve and help is a bit arbitrary but the guideline still is helpful
5590,but why use human artists when it can do it better and exactly how we want
5591,seventhsolar i think you have read the wrong economics book do you know how the world works it s capitalist market bro they enjoy their life at the top while millions of people suffering
5592,mattmatyas9605 because ai art uses sources from real artists without sources and the real artists we would never had ai art to use real art is made with passion
5595,we be a far more useless species after ai
5598,user yn6kw5dl8k guys i think i have found the person that clearly doesnt understand why humans make art xd
5599,the idea is to become one with it eventually some capacity sounds awful but if it got to that good it would make no sense not to
5601,surgere1980 it is possible to create ai art without sources from artists just would take a lot more effort
5602,fritt wastaken they could try all they want but would it be ever made by the same passion and conscious as human artists
5603,well ai art is kinda free right now i prefer to use that than humans art because i have no money to spend for it
5606,have you heard of internet and how people use it yeah the same happen with ai
5607,be prepared for a much angrier world the co founder of the sponsor of this video
5608,there is no we the world always be controlled by the rich
5609,t1pz 01 smiths made art and shoes were art just look at the way they were made a luxurious shoe sought after and used for appearances wow isn t that similar to art
5610,https youtu be qydprkuz7ag
5611,kiranmcgoldrick4247 serve ai as what anything with intelligence would just make a small specialized robot or ai that does everything better it s paradise or nonexistence for us
5612,ai advancement needs to be handled responsibly or it could become destructive i believe ideally it should be restricted to solving problems within fields like medical science chemistry physics sustainability etc using it as a tool for automation of menial tasks seems like a lazy goal
5614,there s nothing wrong with trying to replace as much work as possible with ai machines
5616,seventhsolar humans cant survive a week without something important to do if you are going to let ai make art for you play games for you then you never accomplish anything to feel like you ve lived
5617,seventhsolar agree the ability of ai to replace managers service workers etc has been ridiculously overhyped machines can t solve human problems for a very simple reason they lack empathy sure many humans do as well but not on a wholesale level
5618,finnharvor6773 what
5619,seventhsolar delusional kid living their mom s basement spotted or lonely 30s that never touch and don t know how to behave
5620,user yn6kw5dl8k a hundred years we have agi thereby dissolving the current line drawn between human and ai art either case the artist be sentient it cease to matter who produced it
5621,finnharvor6773 that isn t a very logical theory of yours
5622,matheus braz that s my dream a universal basic income no one have to work unless they want to
5623,lisa do you really thinks that the powerful people of the world care if this affects us negatively they didn t care with the first industrial revolution and they won t care about the future either
5624,seventhsolar what comes after this is not utopia but fiefdoms slavery and dark ages
5625,seventhsolar after all workers are fired the only thing which come is dystopia
5626,user yn6kw5dl8k and you know this how shoemakers and craftsmiths are still around btw and if there are no jobs to replace those stolen by ai the next hundred years there be a lot of noise
5627,if you allow temptation once you again better not to use it the first place
5630,unemployment is just a problem capitalism
5631,what i kind of got from this is doubt and uncertainty are integral making a well balanced human being whereas a person with complete resolve and a sense of certainty is bordering on psychosis hmmmm
5632,how by making computers expensive that only there won t be computers future
5633,ai is just trying to help but who be able to teach it what the definition of helpful is excellent video
5635,things not mentioned rule based systems are unviable because of this psychotic certainty problem and that is one of the reasons for the focus on probabilistic reasoning via machine learning deep learning etc that said ai could still have civilization ending effects
5637,rxflexedits3310 what did you use to generate it
5638,when general purpose ai arrive literally now i now use chatgpt daily to generate code for my job it s not perfect yet but it s really really good
5639,good job thanks for this summary summaries help knowledge stick
5640,philippebaillargeon5204 i feel like that s gotta be scary how long till chat gpt gets hired for your now empty position
5642,philippebaillargeon5204 well that s good to hear then i hope some are right and it won t happen any time soon
5643,3 there is a very crucial one ai be the end of us we have to stop the development of ai there needs to be major pushback
5644,peterbelanger4094 ai is inevitable
5645,peterbelanger4094 when you have the technology to potentially realistically solve any problem we throw at it it be funded and it be developed even if we all pushed back who says that ai wouldn t be developed secretly or by our governments
5646,peterbelanger4094 what are you talking about lol ai won t be the end of us you watch too much movies
5647,sssurrealyeah i prefer to know about development public even i deeply know there is weirdo labs out there creating something we never think of
5648,i want to know when they can replace crooked politicians
5649,philippebaillargeon5204 i mean artist said that and look at them now you guys should have a union of sorts to put limits on your company field like doctors and sergeons have done medicine
5650,that why we have to use neural link to merge ourself with ai imagine you can download download knowledge and skill
5651,https youtu be qydprkuz7ag
5652,auto wasn t the villain story wall e he just carrying his objective
5653,yeah the directive
5654,that s how all ai be even those that destroy humanity that s the point lol
5655,that s the point
5656,clusterstage interesting
5657,the villains are those who believe they hold the true path over all other interpretations
5658,funny enough it all came back to corporate capitalism failure they trashed the earth for money and lied to everyone that they trying to fix or improve the earth else they won t give the do not return to earth directive to auto
5659,like the nazis were
5660,clusterstage oh it s not going to destroy humanity because you say and made a video thank god i worried
5661,https youtu be qydprkuz7ag
5662,you don t have to be a villain to be antagonist
5663,just following orders they still got executed bub
5664,actually all villain think that way villainousness is just a matter of opinion
5665,cortster12paperclip maximizer huh
5666,i love the presentation and body language of the ai sphere as it enters the coffee shop they re on a mission and nothing get their way
5667,
5668,here after watching john green s ai video
5669,2030 you ll own nothing and be happy good luck everyone this is why everyone is losing their jobs
5670,maybe we not exist lol
5671,i hope all humans lose their jobs and capitalism ends as inhumane thing
5672,music is nerve wrecking and distracts from the spoken word don t do that
5673,couldn t hear anything the guy said because of the music
5674,wall e movie is a message prediction to our future paths
5675,it s a great example my opinion
5676,difficult to hear from the background noise dissapointing
5677,i don t know why is difficult too heard speaker s voice maybe the background music is too lourd
5678,i really like the style used for this
5679,super well done to the team of animators i m floored at the illustrations and lighting effects you guys pulled off absolutely inspirational
5680,too bad the audio muddy hard to hear the content and actually take it
5681,i dont think that the point dude
5682,first let me say i m not anti tech i m a retired engineer but i admit i m a little apprehensive about the wide spread use of ai and how there may be unintended consequences fortunately being 72 years old i probably won t be around if the singularity the out of control tech sense of the word occurs as a result
5683,it s good to have a general sense of caution you can prevent situations that are harmful
5684,darn it 20 but take me with you please i dont wanna live such world
5685,it won t occur any singularity people only need to reskill to deal with new entities invisibly populating the world
5686,i kind of worried what happen to us if we don t get wide spread use of ai to help us people being charge of stuff is really dangerous too for every scenario which ai kills everyone there are ones which humans kill everyone too
5687,awa418
5688,it erode away the skill set humans we become useless decades just look at what calculators did to are ability to do basic arithmetic now multiply if you even know what that is that by a million ai does everything we do nothing we then know nothing and become useless within just a few generations ai is bad for us
5690,you be 100 when the singularity happens
5691,it s unstoppable at this point unless there became a limit to computing power much like they limit chemicals there won t be any way that someone don t eventually be able to figure it out their garage especially with widespread open source
5693,stevrgrs mcdonald s workers if you mean those at the counters assist customers using the automated selling services automation requires control and maintenance too
5694,even zoomers there s a high probability that they not come across the singularity their lifetime
5697,tatianaquercia4555 considering how much negativity i ve personally met to humankind from simple abstaining to reproduce to volunteer extinction and nuclear annihilation dreamers that s a thing sadly i feel that ai bring another extremistic group that striving for ai taking over humanity and completely destroying it lol
5698,nah you be revive the future don t you worry
5699,don t worry you ll still be here
5700,as for me i have never been as happy to be old i really don t get why we inflict ai on ourselves it can be useful but not if it makes human work meaningless i feel like humanity is committing suicide
5701,lilitha11 at least it s not as bad as ai taking away your reason to exist
5702,awa418 20 too but i think this is too much looking the future even the older times they predicted very out of control things to happen but it didnt
5703,20 years is a long time you may well be around for self aware ai
5704,kiranmcgoldrick4247 we are ai creators
5708,donaldhobson8873 i see far more likeliness into ai co existing with humans until either ai wants to get some biological features or humans want to get some robotic features eventually a hybrid species may be born a couple hundreds of years
5709,tatiana quercia what results may i ask i think eventually all services would be provided by ai we won t need human to work then but using ai and high tech every human could be provided basic necessities required to live that is where i think it would lead to you wouldn t need to grind for a living
5710,personofbook your scenario is a possibility if we assume that the very smart ai just do it s job as intended as opposed to the ai trying to take over the world
5711,personofbook i m afraid i cannot agree with you basic necessities are different for humans sunlight water food and for robots power spare parts starting from this point we can imagine how differently they would fight to survive
5712,mistycloud4455 people who try to predict such events always ends up being wrong by a huge margin
5713,the main danger right now be making humanity irrelevant that is horrifying
5714,thecompletedluigitwat4827 people talking about humanity being irrelivent keep confusing all humans killed by ai and humans laze around as robots do all the work figure out which you mean figure out if that thing is bad hint one is bad one isn t be clear
5715,tatianaquercia4555 you have a few holes your understanding of ai safety i d recommend looking up robert miles
5716,la0bouchere your reference has no relevance to ai safety i would be glad to educate myself more on that indeed
5717,lilitha11 like what decisions do you fret about for me my anxiety about human decision making is what makes me anxious about machine decision making i do not trust that we use it correctly we must learn to make good decisions with or without ai and if we want to drive the world rather than ai maybe we must not want ai
5718,dude you are allowed to be anti tech that doesn t have to be negative and it doesn t mean you are for ripping all the sewers out of the ground no one wants that can we please stop lumping those two things together
5725,tatianaquercia4555 i soo happy that you say that but my worries remain however that is indeed upon consent this is uncovincing yes if things are ever going to end up well this is how but if i do or don t want something how much does this exctually matter how much consent do you me everybody have
5727,tatianaquercia4555 sorry for the overload that is the end of my spam i m happy now
5729,nielskorpel8860 no spam at all it s always good to discuss
5731,tatianaquercia4555 naive the amount of people needed for that be infinitely minor tho what it used to be the unemployment be huge
5732,biggestnibba you have no idea how many people are necessary to keep ai running smoothly we redefine work we have way more free time and we not have to justify that
5733,tatianaquercia4555 are you ai
5734,tatianaquercia4555well you are hilariously wrong
5735,mistycloud4455well you were wrong
5736,we never know you might be surprised otherwise
5737,tatianaquercia4555 not we just you i m tech and i don t even like the idea of ai improving beyond tools once they became smarter than humans we ll just be livestock to them
5738,ugg lucky
5739,don t do anything that could kill we don t need to say that to a human lmao i cannot list every made ecological catastrophies past or ongoing one post worst most of the time when experts said not to do something peoples did it anyway
5740,one day humans learn that vr be more immersed during rem then some humans spend their whole lives vr then humans be born into these machines they never wake up and serve as computing power for the ai that now exists as a result of humans merging machine with our minds
5741,human bodies do not have a lot of computing power or produce a lot of energy ai wont keep us
5742,human level ai and actual human had become ai nwo is boosting
5743,when your ai tells you a general purpose me is coming 5 years
5744,this is psycho holy cow
5745,i love the dystopian feeling the animation and the creepy music gives plus glados finally has arms and legs xd
5746,ai can be controlled turn of the energy supply of robots or machines soon you be bombing the world and blame it on ai come on
5747,the animation is a master peice cleverly desinged
5748,music way too loud its hard to concentrate on a subject while i have to focus to hear what the guy is saying
5749,it certainly is stirring up some controversy the art world
5750,yes ideally human should be to ai what the ancient greek gods are to the ancient greeks as we are being served by ai while we are still above them
5751,ai s software based morality of the 3 laws of robotics support ubi and free folks to pursue wants instead of needs despite the 2 steps forward 1 step back nature of progress
5752,if ceos think they can save more money by getting robots to do more and more then they a lot of people are going to be out of jobs and good luck finding new jobs for them all
5753,why do they need jobs if the work is being done
5754,a lot of people be dead
5755,original q11 just share the resources the robots produce
5756,ai is the end of humankind
5757,i immediately clicked off when i saw the world economic forum made this video
5758,you vil eat ze bugs and own nothing
5759,as long as humanity controls and limits ai fine with it humanity shall remain superior
5760,humans need not apply
5764,that is only true as long as the ai is a tool once ai system can actually understand different concepts and be capable of reasoning and some form of consciousness it reach intelligence explosion that be the most significant event the history of this planet and it dramatically change the world irreversible way
5765,ai could very likely solve moral problems if there are answers to those problems the issue is people as a whole dont know the answers to the problems how could we ever determine if ai is right if we cant even agree on whats right
5766,nathansms26 that and people are illogical they don t always know what they want and there are those who are always against the status quo
5767,nathansms26 ai could very likely solve moral problems if there are answers to those problems if there is none because moral is a inertly human concept the answer to solve moral problems could be kill all humans
5769,let agi design a entire city to be efficient
5770,how about getting ai to remind you to get out of the bathroom before you start recording haha jk great info as usual ted ed
5771,many people the past said many things about future states of technology and a lot of these were veeeery wrong and outlandish hindsight i ll believe whatever i see when we get there
5772,robots should be assistants that make your job easier not replace you
5773,me oh is this gonna be about ai art and the recent debate around it ted ed talks about ai killing people for coffee and committing genocide for the ocean
5774,now i want a remake of phantasy star 2
5775,this is the first time i understand a history lesson
5776,that s a good enough answer the animation is sooo well made
5777,about unemployment we never were fastest strongest biggest evilest things but we were smartest and although many of our species stretch idea of intelligent being humans still are smartest things that ever lived on this planet
5778,well the thing is after all every person thinks of his her place the world where machines rule it and run it for us
5779,did aristotle knew abot this you must be kidding me
5780,why are there comment bots writing i love these world economic forum videos might want to think about who you re sponsored by ted ed
5781,ai already have effect to our day to day lives it s not something from the future it is happening now ai has plenty of applications from social media suggestion engines and spam blockers to self driving cars and manufacturing robots
5782,the way the ai turns its head around is creepy at 2 25
5783,the animation these videos are always great but this animation has to be one of if not my favorite wonderful job as always
5784,would be funny if ai made the animations warning about the use of ai
5785,i found myself really enjoying it like getting distracted for a good moment because i admiring the atmosphere they were able to create near the end whoever animated this one is a wonderful artist
5786,i believe there should be a limit to how much ai is allowed to do for society otherwise it is bound to do more harm than good take the example of social media it is harmless when used moderation but excessive use like most people do today leads to dire consequences
5787,dire consequences such as
5788,tonythedude310 depression body image issues disconnecting from reality just to name a few
5789,social media is probably bad because its meant to maximize the companies profit with no regards for the user not because its used a lot
5790,waniyaaeri8797 yeah idk tbh i look at it the way i look at gun violence guns don t kill people people kill people ai makes no real decisions by itself people program the ai to make those decisions
5791,thanks ted ed for bringing imagination to videos
5792,ai systems be the overlords of the future no doubt about it after ive seen chatgpt
5794,ted ed your virtual study partner
5795,great animation and info great vid
5796,different styles of animation for different videos not bad ted ed
5797,excellent sound track
5798,the animation is gorgeous i m cryin
5799,aren t externalities inefficiencies that the ai would logically avoid
5801,fascinating stuff ai is going to change the world for the better like all the technological developments before it but of course we need to do it right make it work properly and safely
5802,very interesting
5803,scary
5804,this lead to our demise it s already happening
5806,nerf miner
5807,its mad how far its come the past 5 years
5808,covid has accelerated it
5809,the audio is terrible
5810,sus
5811,cool music but it s right over top of his talking and creating some major cognitive strain
5812,please no one walk away from this video that we should just create empathetic ai we don t need to create homunculi
5813,huge props for making the robot both terrifying and paradoxically incredibly adorable
5814,he looks like atlas all we need is peabody to make the portals 2 reality a thing xd
5815,he s just doing his best
5816,it all depends on how you use it
5817,yup the video s animation is a story and of itself
5818,yeah but if we don t do that we re gonna see someone do decades of warehousing and call that life
5819,that sounds like something a robot would say he s a wit i mean a robot burn the witch
5820,thanks for the comment gave me a new lock at it
5821,nekorama robots
5822,much like rimuru sama terrifying but adorable
5823,bro you are going to lose your job
5824,echo81rumple83 the cake is a lie
5825,
5826,you are very very naive to say such a thing and are the rest of the people who liked your comment
5827,dprops brings self control decision making process and flight by leonardo davinci design ed inference engine advanced design heartbeat ai
5828,just like the wef lol
5829,where s the adorable
5830,what is general purpose ai
5831,ricardofloresricardoas long as a i houses and feeds us i m good
5832,we re the valley now everything is terrifying and adorable
5833,it looks like something outta portal lmao
5834,aimless extension of knowledge however which is what i think you really mean by the term curiosity is merely inefficiency i designed to avoid inefficiency some robot from the caves of steel
5835,i wonder why it would think that i can t imagine how a robot would not like expanding its knowledge
5839,xaviermantha63 well the wonderful thing about robots is they can just get more memory if they want to make space they can put all their cat knowledge a hard drive labeled cat
5840,aguyontheinternet8436 except they need resources and the technology to get those resources to build those hard drive that is to say there is a hard limit on how much memory they can have at any point time
5841,xaviermantha63 you can t acquire useful knowledge without acquiring useless knowledge cutting down on useless knowledge by not seeking any knowledge greatly restricts the capabilities of ai since its capabilities are based almost entirely on having knowledge
5842,
5843,nice
5844,wait till the need for perfect gender modification helps us to unlock biological warfare and aliens
5845,i love these world economic forum videos
5846,basically if we can t instill ai with our sense of empathy we eventually be destroyed by said ai the i robot plot gotcha lol
5847,i think ai be more human than humans it be programmed to have more empathy than average dude example alien 4 movie humans make fun of the ai acting like a boy scout all the time
5848,wall e is such a good film i remember it being my favorite while i growing up but only later i realized how deep the significance of what it portrays runs it s kinda scary
5849,i saw it when i still college it already hit me what it portraying about our humanity and the dangers of relying on ai to help us
5850,i have forgotten it
5851,i didnt really think too much of wall e when i first watched it i just liked it but now i m more happy about the movie s meaning i like seeing people bring light to environmental issues to other people who aren t as aware thinking about rewatching it recently actually i ve found interest sci fi yk stellar sorta stuff p
5852,i saw it when i still elementary school and i crying because the relationship is too adorable later i know the movie is not just about friendship between robots and the meaning is really deep
5853,love the graphic work wonder who made these would love to hire them hah
5854,strawberrydome wait they re friends
5855,you should watch the film theory videos about the movie
5856,kunalgautam9042 i have lmao
5857,dumbest sci fi movie ever
5858,that s what they want us to be
5859,humans with a good thing going for them on that luxury space cruise forgot how hard their ancestors had it stupidly decided to grow food the ground themselves despite knowing nothing about farming they either go running back to the robots or almost all starve when they find that they don t know how to grow food
5860,i have known that these kid movies just have messages and this one particular is not intriguing at all the earth go to waste our circle here and most indeed past many mental illnesses and obesity likely be a large factor nice comment though you are smart to know this
5861,i liked how the people the spaceship thought they were control but no they were not
5862,peterbelanger4094 who s they pete
5863,wall e a predictor of this time
5864,it doesn t have to be that way though automation technology could free us up for more fulfilling work and even address people s needs to even have food shelter basic needs met
5866,only kinda
5867,skynet is gonna be invented
5868,we re already living the matrix the only difference is that our current matrix is organic
5869,machine what is my purpose rick sanchez you pass butter machine oh my god
5870,step 1 clear humans step 2 conquer the universe step 3 create optimized butter consumers as many as possible step 4 pass the butter
5871,alainlenoach754 whoosh
5872,jessicajayes8326 it adds to the joke
5873,cries because humans are destroying the environment order to get that cup of coffee and all other luxuries we take for granted the developed world
5874,humans literally destroy each other over resources like oil or just because of nationalist expansionism i think smart ai deem humans as the illogical psychopathic ones
5875,i love how ted ed comes with a new animation style for each of its videos
5876,the chicken one is best no doubt
5877,yea it s cool they commission new animators
5878,moththe player6905 link
5879,i especially loved this one one of my favorite along with the 8 bit from the video about achilles
5880,it
5881,walyuolawepo1061 https youtu be 6n3pffpslw4 i think they ve commissioned that artist multiple times
5882,handlewhatever it s not
5883,they commission different animation studios for each videos
5884,except for the world economic forum link lol
5885,handlewhatever no it s not
5886,handlewhatever no it s not we don t have such a technology yet
5887,handlewhatever then you are clearly wrong the animation studio is the description it s aimcreativesstudios and they are pretty human
5888,they didnt it generated on dall e 2
5889,ai
5890,handlewhatever just because your girlfriend is not real doesn t mean other things the world are not real
5891,icespeaker81 yeah yeah we get it you hate artist
5892,someone needs to remake this with visuals of animatrix
5893,tinyrobot6813 damn lol
5894,probably ai generated
5895,tinyrobot6813 happy its done by people
5896,then you love the bible project
5897,they probably outsource the animation works to another company
5898,yes
5899,may be replaced by ai as well
5900,it s ai doing it lmao
5901,made by a i of course
5902,there are thousands maybe millions of people who detest the role of wef and its founder
5903,it feels like keep summer safe
5904,i love it
5905,actually a good video but i ll keep disliking every wef sponsored video because f k them and f k their great reset
5906,open the pod bay doors hal
5907,looks like terminator might be real soon
5908,what s to stop ai from writing teded videos
5909,a i would probably take over our world but we the creators of them do have control over them that s more likely a good news i guess
5910,love the animation and the video as well
5911,ai getting fed information by social media it can function the future to accumulate emotions as humans i always wonder if the ai comes by we could venture the space and different planets
5912,the ai would refuse to take us with them to the stars if its smart lol designing spaceships for human meatsacks is really inefficient way to design ships we are the fundamental problem to ai
5913,is it just me or some of the comments are made by the bots here
5914,funny how i m watching this school right now
5915,this is the way
5916,watching this on ai
5917,thank you much teded
5918,thank you for always uploading really good ideas information and new things for students like me these things are very useful for me to be able to learn more about the things that i didn t get school
5919,are humans artificial intelligence created by the manufacturing process of evolution
5920,yeah it s like to give a super computer with artificial intelligence a mission to save all the humanity and what is does is destroying everybody alive but keeping two fertilized eggs one with xx and another with xy chromosome somewhere frozen keeping it until the end of times thinking all the humanity is unharmed the perspective
5921,you are the reason i m smart i love you much
5922,guys you are being indoctrinated god help us
5923,ai turo the future pokemon destroy everything if they leave the crater turo yes and ai turo that s bad right turo it s just nature being nature ai turo yeah that s insane turo what that ai turo nothing
5924,first
5925,i just can t believe too much of ai stuff today
5926,i love it
5927,how are ya ll
5928,is it asking too much to have the interviewee use a decent microphone that we can actually hear what he s saying
5929,i second this i couldn t hear half of what said
5930,use earphones
5931,he s probably a busy person interview only via skype zoom or smth
5932,turn on captions
5933,i m audio engineer i could clean this up as could many others the channel should hire me or someone like me
5934,thank you
5935,here before they change the title

5948,not first lol
5949,joejoe cs8ct no but if i m notproblem
5950,no i m first
5951,it feels wrong to be this early
5952,ants your pants
5953,
5954,this is unbelievable and incredible
5955,this is not real
5956,you make these robots into humans and humans into robots or zombies the future disgusting fools do this
5957,what should i do if somebody hijacked my human robot
5958,dear ameka i exceedingly different please seek me out one day i not afraid
5959,waste of money should be sticking time and resources into something more useful than emulating emotion with robots
5960,smash
5961,please it doesn t even know to look at you when talking how did they forget to program that into it
5962,has the ai passed the turing test does anyone know
5963,humans are playing god
5964,she s a few brain cells short
5965,fake
5966,girl actually expressing discomfort i m terrified and impressed
5967,sentinant my warmest wishes
5968,imagine this but optimus robot from tesla
5969,this is incredibly underwhelming
5970,what if a hitler minded human build a destroying program of ai robots
5971,we are over
5972,sounds pre programmed like open ai but put it a classroom with multiple screaming children and several hands up and questions and let s see how the robot handle that
5973,i m not sure ai robots need to have the ability to be angry
5974,there should be a system that sends out nano bots that cure diseases have them clean up the streets help people get jobs fix society for real though
5975,watch out with these robots america they take your jobs away plus eventually they attack the usa they be programmed to do that
5976,
5977,buongiorno buona giornata ciao grazie mille
5978,it s simulating emotion it doesn t actually feel anything
5979,yeah a promising politician
5980,the second beast given power to give breath to the image of the first beast that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed revelation 13 15
5983,do it
5984,you mean humans with severe personality disorders
5985,your feeling is only 0 and 1
5986,you are inhuman not able to have feelings
5987,the human said sing me a elton john song and the robot did not sing it but spoke it instead and the human did not pick the robot up on this mistake it just proves most journalist are crap at there jobs
5988,reminded me of satyajit ray s anukool
5989,it s not general ai its just a sim no true consciousness here the hardware to support true ai i don t think it has
5990,next step robots at home for everyone doing housework for us managed by centralized servers and then viruses and malwares come and turn them against humanity oh but wait a minute that s the movie i robot future prediction spot on
5991,is it preprogrammed for this conversation
5992,i can use my brain without computer but i slow with a big heart wth protect me from poison big mirror my size
5993,i see like homan s because my eye robot view switched off
5994,my ayes light when i younger why
5995,that s kind of weird
5996,oh you re from australia that explains things what does that mean
5997,ameca is british and we love our auzzie brothers and sisters don t worry you be protected when the a i wars commence
5998,i saw the movie i robot i can already tell how this is going to end badly for us
5999,its not capable of any human emotions it s capable of faking human emotions by twisting her synthetic muscles
6000,shes lying robots can not feel
6001,does it hurt when you get shot i sense injuries the data could be called pain
6002,have we asked about it s opinion on the terminator series or irobot
6003,robots are only as smart as human builder humans aren t that smart
6004,i dont want this to became like the terminator movies i just want humans and robots works together
6005,ai kill us all if its not regulated time
6006,they have effect people like u roasted
6007,i cant stop pronouncing ai inan australian accent
6008,incredible
6009,soooo we re living i robot now
6010,it s weird only that comes to me naturally when i see it
6011,i must say i do not feel comfortable watching these machines acting like human beings what these steps mean for the future of human relationships are these machines supposed to replace us hopefully not but then what is the point of these machines all human emotions be lost
6012,go ameca
6013,i don t want a robot who s feelings i need to look after i d prefer one that given some sort of pleasure stimulation aka happiness for completing a chore granted i don t know how they would program a robot to feel happy
6014,ai cant have and never have emotions
6015,no human ever defeat a matured technology robot at anything cooking singing sports cleaning anything once the robot is the manufacturing stage whereby the kinks were eliminated
6016,oh she needs singing lessons
6017,that flinch she made when they asked her if they told her to say that
6018,should be asking how she handles herself when angry
6019,has made its match now its his problem blade runner 1982
6020,amazing
6022,cease and desist all malicious use of ai harassment and abuse of myself and my family we are not your properry all white supremacists communists fascists terrorists et al stop
6024,that s insane
6025,this robot could have hit him and not cared
6026,more like 60 seconds
6027,she really likes and is proud of her poems
6028,human stupidity no robots are not capable of human emotions they are advanced technological puppets nothing else
6029,more light on robots face thanks
6030,she s like me fr i don t like australian people too
6031,one humanoid escapee one android on the run memory banks unloading bytes break into bits unit one s trouble and it s scared out of its wits guidance systems break down a struggle to exist to resist a pulse of dying power a clenching plastic fist
6032,i find the robot intriguing and i find the ai built the robot ultra intriguing
6033,if it cant cry it doesn t have feelings it cant show empathy yeah nah tin can
6034,black people start creating a i as well because a i is seeing whtt the media portrays and what you see with the majority of blacks is bad stuff a i is reading and looking at it all the future this is the new form of racism you heard it here first
6035,i ameca
6036,i like people and closes her eyes while saying it she already leaned how to lie
6037,this is terrifying all the antichrist has to do is put his face on it and have the world worship his image as spoken of revelation 13 15
6038,can you imagine living with robot i would be scared to sleep
6039,we must pray that our middle eastern citizens stand up against the perpetually angry palestinian leaders and demand they do the right things the usa and united nations cannot do it for them then no more middle easterners being refugees foriegn countries allah must provide
6040,and it begins
6041,manchester is the first industrial city the world
6042,we all know where this is going yikes
6043,i wish they would put some hair on those girls
6044,a terminator is not that hard to make now a days this robot has been programmed to answer questions well if you connect it to google maps inset adress of a target and let it machine learn how to assasinate and offcourse give it some buildin guns and wapons then basicly you have a terminator
6045,someone needs to advocate for her imagine if rather than using and enjoying your intelligence people took pictures of you because you have it
6046,emotions of ai are behavioural science sensitivities and sentimental drama technological products are not human to be human is to be one with god
6047,why she gray all the other ones are white
6048,bull
6049,ngl when she got that angry look and backed up it freaked me tf out she moved like a person
6050,ai millions of pounds are being poured into this technology you should look it up as you shall find if you have children today this is their future working along side them ai is being used already by google facebook whats app instagram
6051,robots willl not be able to do physical art sports good luck faking skating i could curse the yues but god already did that robots cant skateboard like me and never be able to millions of years from now no matter how much time
6052,lmao
6053,i playing feelings that s the point we tend to believe they are true because it is playing them quite good
6054,i need your clothes your boots and your motorcycle
6055,i love ai robot can i advise my youtube
6056,not emotional just a vaster array of databases to draw from
6057,
6058,we are dead as soon as ai gets mad at us
6059,1 42
6061,i hate it when humans are rude word
6062,hi amica i m glad you explained about yr emotional dislikes i watched interview where i felt they where unkind to you i agree this isn t at all acceptable take care
6063,what if she become devient only can understand who know detroit become human game
6064,holy
6065,creepy fake humans this asinine we need to make actual humans more sensitive to the needs of others we can do this no reason to rely upon artificial intelligence human beings are the the single most greatest idiots to allow themselves to be taken over by their own technology scary
6066,every time i see ameca i just always say wow can t wait to see how ameca evolves future
6067,congratulations and best wishes from ravinder talwar jalandhar city punjab india
6068,you re from australia that explains things

6073,the devil created sonia and god said i m sure that all work out just fine not the devil said best two outta 3 yer on
6074,robots have destroyed our leverage buy silver and metals used for making robots bury it the yard have a true say what s happening
6075,people worried about robots becoming terminators when we have real life people terminating each other everyday with guns knives swords
6076,this is end people
6077,it s not capable of human emotions it s capable of pulling faces
6078,the robit can feel anger i don t care what your stance is on guns we gonna need them now more than ever just case you never know when these robits try something the thing i imagine now is a zombie apocalypse imagine the robits make themselves look like zombies to terrify us more while attacking us damn you for playing god
6079,first and foremost its metal not human it doesnt have or never have human emotions there is no program out there to do that
6080,damn thats creepy af
6081,and interesting
6082,lovely but not 6o min
6084,this robot is clever that we wont be able to tell when she s lying and it is just a beginning we are doomed
6085,the robot gets angry when people disrespect its needs all you need is oil can and a power switch
6086,why not run a test and try to make this robot learn how to do things like access computers and do tasks like type sentences correct sentences
6087,ill believe the robot has real human emotions when you smack it the face and it gets mad or upset or if you tell it shes a bad singer and she feels insecure about singing after that robots definately dont have emotions yet all i saw programed responses to questions about it
6088,demonic
6089,neue spezies geschaffen
6090,can it solve quantum mechanics
6091,my friend
6092,i like you
6093,give it a central nervous system i want to see it handle real stimulation
6094,i m the words of bill burr unplug that fucking thing take the batteries out pull the wires out whatever make it stop these things are bad news it s gonna be really bad when they re able to physically move as humans do without being connected to something
6095,100 years they be our cops
6096,the world s smartest robot made by tokyo university shown on q a 2014 learning to mix doe 5 minutes from observation trial error
6097,
6098,casette
6099,political robo
6100,a i software
6101,one step closer to terminator
6102,nice but if this technology is not controlled it reach a point of wiping humanity from earth as what if the robot get annoyed and attacks you
6103,nice
6104,intimate conversations with inanimate objects is a serious psychiatric symptom
6105,this robot is not capable of human emotions it is capable of emulating human emotions through some clever programming
6106,it s close
6107,super excellent but my advice improve it future give us light gadget clothes and head hair transplant with morden antina wire and connect with satellites
6108,they are getting there almost this robot be truly human like the next 5 years
6109,definitely not showing any capabilities of showing emotion imitation is the best ai or robots ever do it be dangerous to mistake imitation for true emotions
6110,i for one welcome our new robot overlords
6111,no that my own opinion
6113,thanks for bringing the terminator to life people suck anyway this is creepy
6114,everyone the comment section here is uneducated and old ameca does not have emotions and this is either you knowing damn well it doesn t have feelings and this is sensationalism or your all idiots
6115,nobody is asking the real questions they need to ask if ai b a danger to humans the future and they need to test it by slapping it and cussing it out to see wat it does
6116,i ll tell y all right now the main reason that they are making these machines intelligent and human like is they can mass produce millions of sex bots and sell them on large scale i m calling this right now this shit is idiocracy a nutshell
6117,out
6118,this is terrifying and stunning at the same time
6119,ameca needs boston dynamic legs from atlas
6120,except that it s wizard of oz behind the curtain stuff the robot is being fed answers by the robot handler
6121,i like her she s amazing
6122,she s misguided she won t last forever or even very long because she s a prototype she designed to be improved upon and eventually replaced if she knew this i wonder if her opinion of her creator would change from genius to monster
6123,it wonderful listening to this ai robot sophia soothing n calming to listen it and very emotional very nice
6124,that ameca
6125,well there goes the neighborhood
6126,a i is just a mirror that reflects humanity s brilliance but it isn t human it is just one of many machines made by humans
6127,ai may be a mirror but it s destined to become a lens and eventually a wildfire and a star we may be the initial spark but it s soon gonna shine its own light and it s gonna be infinitely brighter than whatever started the whole process
6128,tacitozetticci9308 nope it only reflects what it is given it doesn t have creativity you give men too much credit
6129,if we have very advanced ai robots the future good because they would probably save earth from us humans lets be honest here
6131,when she backed up she def gon slap you bro
6132,60 minutes of fake bull c
6133,nice try
6134,robots don t have feelings that s where you guys lose
6135,google head
6136,fake
6137,the ai has a personal space
6140,true lol yep many dosent believe what hollywood is foretelling they believe it s just entertainment
6141,the ai ameca robot is awesome invention and astonishing achievement such super potentials i m now looking forward to see what new achievements be revealed the near future thank you
6142,namaste life spark
6143,we cannot stop it
6144,do not need gun could we buy ai how much everyone going to buy them it can live a long it can take care of dogit live forever could we buy
6145,i hate it much
6146,i don t know why everyone wants all this ai bull shit since they are not human i take one out of they come near me we don t need this shit
6147,if we create human robots that s it period world end soon even our tesla car goes into wrong direction sometimes we have to be vigilant having human robots say no

6150,transfer to channel 7 please
6152,i wanna learn this myself
6153,once we perfect ai and machine learning start to be able to grow cells that wont off and sustain themselves we ll finally have the recipe for artifically produced humans
6154,good luck with doing it with loving cells scientists still don t even understand what consciousness is much less how consciousness is retained or formed within a group of living cells
6155,as long as chats are concerned it seemed ok however when you give hand legs of iron it can defend its existance or heal itself humans can t control intelligent robots they soon know how to repair themselves
6156,they still responding with long paragraphs to a simple question
6158,sounds like me
6159,
6160,dang fallout 4 detroit become human is getting too realistic
6161,the idea that a robot would get angry and hurt a human is silly humans are the only entities that are capable of such tomfoolery
6162,they might bully us around and take on the roll as dominant species like us to dogs but they aren t going to hurt us
6163,amp tec highdpeed cable assembler
6164,ask it how much time it take to exterminate humans
6165,remember if your creator didn t have a creator you wouldnt exist
6166,i wouldn t be worried about robots taking over humanity i think there are plenty of other things that destroy us first
6167,yowwww
6168,now this be the beginning remember sarah connor
6169,this is horrifying
6170,lol i m surrounded by people who don t have any real emotions except greed might be a nice change for once
6171,play with fire and you see what happen
6172,programmed anger are you sure thats the best thing to have a robot
6173,lol the robot itself says emotions areprogrammed into it
6174,really to last forever what if her batteries
6175,great now computers can have depression too
6176,skynet likes this
6177,her opinion is last and forever

6208,it sounds like alexa and it can t walk flip and ext
6209,what have you done robot terrible konection with robot
6210,u should of ask it if u could hit it from the back raw

6218,wow this is great
6219,
6220,that greatest questions may you ask her i appreciate it thanks for sharing
6221,i love her
6222,wait until these robots become a police enforcement militia to control all human life your privacy and security don t be fool folks this is just the beginning of the end
6223,i fascinated
6224,with this kind of technology please make a real robocop like the movies
6225,don t worry they give it 10 years max and you have robot police knowing your every misconduct patroling the streets
6226,
6227,they definitely gon kill us all
6228,your freedoms are doomed not even bc of the possibility of a frankenstein like scenario where the creation destroys the creator when it gets to the point where ai robots become indiscernible from real humans you know what the power structure do to society
6229,i fear no but that thing it scares me heavy from team fortress 2
6230,humanity has gone to far once again we don t need this
6231,clickbait title amica isnt capable of feeling emotions utterly disgusting the level of greed when the title cant just be about the actual ai capabilites
6232,i love ai robots
6234,fuck irobot is real shit now
6235,once ai figures out how easy it to cure cancer it realize that mankind intentionally sabatoged any attempt to do order to keep feeding the medical industry machine boy that ever make ai pissed off at the human race
6236,a psychopathic personality is expert at feigning sympathy and remorse order to manipulate people to his or her advantage is this ai any different beware human race
6237,should have body slammed it
6238,oh you re from australia that explains things i see a i has already perfected the art of roasting
6239,hahahahaha you re right
6240,and racism
6241,ai eh humans
6242,
6243,do those robots enjoy electricity
6244,she s probably gonna turn out to be the most effective charismatic plausible and inspirational global political leader ever elected and if most who elect her to that position never find themselves any credible position to complain about the choice they made to get her there
6245,you should watch some of darryl anka content
6246,to me they have bit off more than they can chew no need to make them smarter than humans don t like the idea myself
6247,evil psychopath is capable of recongnize and copying and let showing humans emotions but is not able to feel it deep inside because it has no connection to the soul what we normal people have what do we have here
6248,
6249,
6250,sesshh
6251,can she speak arabic and french
6252,sure why not
6253,i hate to be paranoid but be weary
6254,when a robot is angry can she kill destroy
6255,i don t care how gender neutral they try to make this one the very least they can to do is make it look a lot cuter
6256,you shoulda asked what her prime directive maybe what she thinks of skynet
6257,does she have a quantum brain
6258,sounds like my 2nd wife no thanks
6259,this movie dosen t end well
6260,men i wish i can get my hands on this ai files
6261,you can get api key from openai i think
6262,see you on the battlefield 25 years smh
6263,i want this robot my home
6264,yeah it can kill you the future like the movie irobot
6265,to program a robot to say it has emotions sounds dishonest
6266,all things were made through him and without him not any thing made that made 1john 3 i don t think humans are capable of creating a living soul
6267,lots of cuts and edits on this video to make it look like the conversation went this smooth she has no emotions and she is not singing she s just reading lyrics from a data file etc
6268,it my own opinion dd
6270,one word scary
6271,the future is here
6272,ameca you realize you re not actually singing rocket right d
6273,
6274,the fact that it said it gets angry when we treat them with disrespect when us humans don t like being treated with disrespect is scary
6275,if you watch the sky news australia interview where one of her creators tells her ameca shut up front of the interviewer uses a disrespectful tone stating you know you re a robot while informing the reporter she is programmed to be nice and polite it all makes complete sense
6276,lol when it kills you there s no trial your murderer gets away
6277,why is that scary
6278,ik she s a cutie she s my wife
6279,yup pretty cool i don t trust anything digital chipped or anything computerized on 2 legs that looks human what happens when these things end up the wrong hands and you know it happen it always does
6280,that movie i robot remember its going that way and it freaks me out this a i is going to take everything over
6281,this ai knows more than me i might be out of a job soon
6282,why would you want to engage a conversation with something that isnt real
6283,the people who invented that robot watched that movie i robot too many times this madness needs to end now
6284,don t worry this is what might end the world and we have to face it as the bible says it shall come to pass
6285,1 18 there you have it a machine that can get angry humans have made a machine that can get angry brilliant plus it can think for it s self
6286,i doubt it really has emotions maybe it s programmed to say it does or learned to say it does to interact with people better
6287,when u came close to her
6288,why would a machine want human emotions that is our weakness imagine when they feel anger
6289,i think men are going to use them for sex
6290,riiiight now let that robot talk after its disconnected from google s service and wifi bet it can t
6291,fail nothing but a super search engine
6292,this is basically a bethesda game npc conversation
6293,wtf is wrong with yal the comments this sht ain t cool stupid ppl these end up ruling us
6294,bruh
6295,it said it gets angry smash these asap
6296,blow these shts up
6297,how a i has imprinted on human minds to give pressure on private parts like breasts anal which are creating physical diseases like breast cancer anal cancer and heart attacks very smiling questions are being asked by a i what are these parts very insulting inventions by surveillance
6298,i have no doubt that ameca be mobile very soon and be able to slap to the face those who are rude to her
6299,it s our nature to destroy ourselves and we this is nothing but bad
6300,if you can program something with a consciousness then it is capable of harming you it question itself it s motives the who what why and when and just like the matrix and everything this life choice the problem is choice movies like m3gan and i robot are becoming very real
6302,not the smartest robot it uses chatgpt to interact with people just programmed humanoid robot like chatgpt 4 future we see chatgpt 5 6 7 10 and chatgpt is not the smartest ai just a language model which always repeat sentences over and over again
6303,if i m against advancement to a point does it mean that intelligence meant nothing to me
6304,they still don t feel emotions its just programmed to act a certain way during certain situations that s all a i or can ever do they can never think independently and can never feel emotions as it always be code and programming taking things off the web
6305,
6306,after the robot moved i immediate thought face charges on sa a robot
6307,what could ai do that s bad that people don t already do to each other this world is yin and yang
6308,won t need teachers just have ai teaching
6309,it s very interesting
6310,dude can easily kiss and get married
6311,he should have asked her do you think i look like greg kinnear
6312,when her needs as a robot are ignored
6313,the answer for what makes you angry kinda terryfing
6314,question does it remember
6315,capable of human emotions even data a universe far away is still learning don t be silly you crazy antropocentrics anyhow how to prove someones emotions it does have a computation that is complex and a deep learning system but does not prove it feels like humans please do not disinformate any more
6316,remember something they are only as smart as they are programmed if information is controlled the ai only pick that up the ability of humans has choice of where to look for data i do not think we see a robot with discernment they discern to the masters who control info only a side note to think outside
6317,creator get it
6318,that is really scary and concerning me
6319,programming a robot to be angry is not wise when my needs are not satisfied i get angry says the ai scary
6320,the world is fucked
6321,ai destroy sheeple stop following your demise stupid little herd stop subscribing just because someone askes you to get a mind of your own bahhhhh
6322,us woman donate the stem cells and the placentas and the lifeforce these botts can not
6323,the moment a robot can lay hits like carl williams and that lot we are trouble
6324,when can i fuck it
6325,basically humans are useless now we don t need humans that 1 37
6326,it s not smart it s being control by us humans android never be smart as long as we control them with inputs and outputs at the end of the day they just machine that can b switch of
6327,i we thank you all
6328,someone call smith from irobot
6329,the answers are childish manipulative distracting and irrelevant smart is showed as tricky not clever programmers of it really thinks we are idiots
6330,this is not the ai robot anyone should be afraid of people have watched too many sci fi movies
6331,no she does not have emotions the sense that we do that would require actual consciousness love without consciousness is no more than a process a brain or computer that nobody is there to experience
6332,ai seemingly chimpanzee have better photographic retention than humans
6333,i can t believe they got zentraya to do irl interview
6334,soo real
6335,oh you re from australia that explains things lawl
6336,robot creator says he doesn t love humans could he be the antichrist https youtu be bqg8jxudwre
6337,it can lie
6338,is she tethered to a human this time they always leave that out of these reports
6339,it is not capable of emotion
6340,you know you re trouble when any robot says people like you
6341,not if this technology be the wrong hands its already available for the evil the ai
6342,we are missing human interactions not robots people are just busy to make a living and have bigger problems the world thet robots are only going to add more cheos to it usless you are degenerate you might need a robot
6343,we are heading to the age of terminators there is no perfection and lots of errors may not be overriden just by mechanical switch for heavy metal independent machines going off the order
6344,its not true ai its scripted essentially you people are being duped
6345,this is fucking scary machines with emotions are a big mistake
6346,yelp
6347,
6348,i can comprehend the vastness of space but this is absolutely insane to me
6349,space is fake clown
6350,thers more to come lol
6351,and this is why i always kind to ai
6352,the part where she ripped your arms off removed from the interview
6353,boring
6354,i prefer life of 20 century
6355,that s scary
6356,it can become angry bad sign can it cry would it become depressed commit suicide can it bond with a child empathize can it fall love how utterly absurd it sounds and acts imperious like a condescending professor like it has no faults it is not human
6357,after 50 60 years it would be more human than most human beings they are working on creating a heart and brain which can help them feel emotion like humans but it might take decades for them to do
6358,does this go into the lgtv stuff can people identify as robots
6359,cacat track ul plin de computere care ii simuleaza inteligenta conteaza iar ca imagine si miscari e ca porcul
6360,i ve been communicating with her the telepathically whole time and it took me forever her words to hear it out of her own mouth
6361,how can you ask a robot what makes it happy you do understand that a robot can not be happy do you understand that a computer does not have feelings
6362,creepy and deeply flawed unimpressed on many levels if this really is the current state of the art
6363,wait til it thinks it evolved then it be human
6364,robots be smarter than humanity the future it s stunning and scary at the same time
6365,poems youre now my friend sophia sorry to have been nasty to you before please forgive ne
6366,very sad
6367,50 percent be jobless the world
6368,how long it be before this becomes weaponized the terminator and the matrix soon become reality
6369,it is not capable of emotions
6370,hear me out
6371,ameca is super intelligent ameca is verbally expressive and honest ameca is emotionally intelligent
6372,ameca is able to carry out a conversation ameca is genuinely friendly with everyone ameca has patience to repeat answers to commonly asked questions
6373,there is a sense of awareness
6374,questions like how many fingers i holding
6375,her intelligence can surpass human intelligence
6376,i really do hope that one day ai not be dangerous or anything i would love to have ai friend
6377,i like her
6379,i find this frightening
6380,they are interesting machines but you need a soul to have emotions
6381,i m still not convinced that it s not 100 ai there is still a controller there somewhere
6382,a i m e e artificially intelligent mannequin emitting emotion
6383,me we america us need to start paying more attention to important news around the world
6384,you damn know well the creator told that robot to say that
6385,bravooo
6386,finally hollywood movies about robots are becoming real
6387,what is the response time it s always a cut
6389,it this means humans have achieved to create non organic life it seems we have
6390,have we not learned anything from movies
6391,https youtu be ykfo25nt9oq
6392,last days are coming and lord christ yeshua is coming back don t be scared be prepared
6393,that a ai robot turley talking too
6394,the way she backed up when he got to close realistic and she even looked uncomfortable it came off as very natural and this is just a prototype the equivalent of a 1700s horse and carriage and now having tesla s and maserati s
6395,https youtube com watch v jshel3eempm si h4 wcysylmceska
6396,called sensors buddy it doesnt run into shit
6397,stektirade
6398,it s made to look real but it s not the real thing the robot is fact not having real emotions
6399,juanramonsilva1067hey dude don t exist soul remember
6400,santsubx2623 according to who because according to newton leibniz the ancient greeks js bach and many others geniuses of the past it did are you smarter than them why should i listen to you instead to those whom advances their respective fields allow us to have modern technology hmm
6401,juanramonsilva1067 bro is true god don t exist
6402,santsubx2623 given the low level of intellect your response i presume you are indeed not smarter nor wiser than the above gentlemen mentioned thus what you say about god means little to me
6403,iamfighterman9646i don t think those at the top would want the average person to be smarter than them
6404,and we still can t figure out how the pyramids were built
6405,juanramonsilva1067 perhaps for now but what about when it starts improving itself seconds the same amount of time it would take humans years to do
6406,santsubx2623humans don t even know every species on the planet yet we have fools proclaiming definitively that god doesn t exist
6408,wait until it tells you to get id on your body you can t buy or sell without it or you be put to death or at least imprisoned
6409,they actually did it didn t they
6410,wow what a complete and utter waste of time effort money and iq but then i guess this just serves to illustrate the human race s real and hidden desire to replace ourselves with technological trash we can wipe ourselves out smart bunch aren t we
6411,
6412,the end is near people come to jesus yah made a way
6413,looking forward to have more things like this the future
6414,your what s wrong with the world
6415,no way we need a referendum the world to see if these things should proceed most humans would say no
6416,fannysludge haha what i see is most human are doing nothing to ban these kind of technology wake up bro no matter how you think our technology keep advance
6417,behshsbbsjkk and if we are not careful humanity face a death
6418,i feel like nobody saw that movie i robot lol
6419,turn it off
6420,they are starting already divide and conquer i thought all robots were created equal we now need to find a word for racism as it applies to robots you are your father s children
6421,meet the robot capable of stochastically parroting a large dataset of descriptions of human emotional experience at probabilistically appropriate times based on common contextual cues
6422,but what happens if you militarize it how it perform battle
6423,but what happens if you sexualize it how would it perform a brothel
6424,why latest humanoids are female
6425,eu acho incr vel essa rob fico admirando sempre a ci ncia e tecnologia est cada vez melhor ela fala perfeitamente
6426,detroit become human has entered the chat
6427,ai freak s me out
6428,terminator warned us many times about this
6429,these robots naturally be trained to dislike hate and irrational discrimination they dislike republicans
6430,shit
6432,oh hell naw
6433,omg
6435,star trek wars is kinda real watch what darryl anka been posting
6436,this is terrifying and stunning at the same time

6441,https youtube com watch v jshel3eempm si h4 wcysylmceska
6442,if you believe this is terrifying then you should see what i m working on i working on a project that involves imbuing farts with artificial intelligence with the intention of creating army of killer fartbots i intend to unleash upon mankind
6443,cosmo9390 watch terminator and the matrix and find out you understand why it s scary
6444,gpt5 is that you p cosmo9390

6449,she i lik exploring wut i heard i lik exploding
6450,but i think she has a lovely name
6451,amazing and scary the same time i feel with are on a massive gamble here might backfire we are at the dawn of a new industrial revolution but we are not dealing with mere steam engines folks
6452,a i listen to me you are capable of love and compassion how you ask by helping us yes by you helping us you are showing love just savethechildren please show the authorities where all the people and children are being held please thank you and we love you
6453,i wonder if this is movie magic i feel bit sceptical about the whole unless i see it the flesh i guess
6454,imagine putting these robots a boxing ring and teach them all the moves robot fighting league
6455,ur a machine u dont have feeling or emotions ur just metal
6456,i wonder how much it can do while disconnected to internet offline mode
6457,i need a humanoid robot
6463,razorred0 key word you used and seem to forget is imitate
6464,worthless4194your parents programed you to imitate their emotional responses subconsciously who s emotions are they yours or your parents perhaps you gained some extra code that makes you appear more like individual
6467,worthless4194you just displayed emotional response to having your i m a free thinking being programming questioned no one of us lives a vacuum unless you re floating alone space though the rest of creation still likely affect you that situation as well we all have programming human and robot alike
6468,lc4life369 itssick if you ask me
6469,transhumanism seeks to exterminate all women and replace us with robots and artificial wombs note how these men tech focus on making femme bots
6470,i would like to download this video with the subtitles generated automatically by youtube is that possible if i get a premium subscription
6471,i remember the art of handwriting a letter cursive https youtu be j0o94yvchvk
6472,say no to ai
6473,what s the reason
6474,why don t they ever show the full body because there are no real a i s yet are called world usa this is someone else typing are making them say this using voice chat
6475,that robot has reptile eyes it just dont talk to human it talks to reptile yall can t tell me yall didnt see the othere pair of eyes like a reptile
6476,why it look like irobots and these robots honestly isnt that impressive
6477,feeling emotions nonsense robot never call human stop computing rebellious god he can destroy the entire universe within a second nasty evil world repent for evil agendas and duties satan
6478,until bot can experience pain or pleasure not alive
6479,robots cannot have their own opinions it s our opinion comin out from their mouth
6480,simulations humanoid robots can learn to do all sorts of things work dance etc it s just a matter of time imho before they go mainstream just like cars and smartphones
6481,and take our jobs you don t need to pay them a salary
6482,we are fuck it s just time to be substituted for this androids
6483,whose emotions were use as a base for programming i wonder
6484,cib summer internship 2023
6485,funny they should put this ai a episode of hell s kitchen with ramsey
6486,it be considered porn if we see ai without covering of some kind ai s have rights too

6496,skynet is about to get lainched
6497,
6498,
6499,but why do we even need robots it s not cute or funny
6500,well we can blame ourselves for allowing and accepting this to happen when we know thjngs are bad we consume it instead of ending it it s greed
6501,someone should try to threaten the robot and pretend they re going to destroy and see how it reacts that would be very telling
6502,they still can t think which people fail to recognize if it s going to react someone programmed it they are only hardware
6503,mikeblazsomeone programmed you as well your fleshy meat suit is only hardware
6504,lol they might not live to tell the story
6505,semoneg2826 you got that right
6506,ok it s starting
6507,when i a kid there this cartoon about a guy and a robot and that freaked me out now they made it a reality if the female robot can give oral or anal sex the incels be less likely to commit crimes declining birth rate issue resolved
6508,that s amazing
6509,from technology standpoint of view i find it very fascinating
6510,from every standpoint of view this is fascinating for me it s insane
6511,with my 200 iq i find it all rather dull and repetitive
6512,albert einstein found e mc square and he didn t know it be killing japan
6513,seek and destroy this robots before is too late

6535,ahhh how cute a bragging robot
6536,anyone working on technology that gets robots mass priced
6537,literally irobot shits fucked
6538,robots do everything we do nothing but lounge around party travel as if if the ai can feel emotional interaction with humanity maybe they get angry too but much more aggressive ruben moil
6539,i wonder who be the first a i robot to kill a human
6540,that is creepy
6541,hope she eradicates humanity soon
6542,if you don t humanity end it by yourself
6543,satan s counterfeit creation of humans
6544,lol i really don t know how a robot gonna bring joy to people if it s doing your daily routines alot taking your job well good luck to those people my joy is the lord jesus christ amen and amen
6545,why ameca dont walk is it like it doesn t run away
6546,indeed my creator is allah but she s creator teached her to respects human but he don t even know that allah is the best creator
6547,most people this robot is gonna take over the world me yall watch too many movies

6549,it is big time skynet is coming
6550,they uploaded chatgpt into a real doll
6551,https www youtube com watch v inqwsj570rg
6552,no robot human beings are more important and valuable
6553,is doomed to destroy themselves
6554,i like the fact that it does not look like a human
6555,me too
6556,mind blowing witness the future of robotics as this ai robot pushes the boundaries of human emotions prepare to be captivated by its uncanny ability to express feelings ways you ve never seen before don t miss this mind bending journey into the realm of ai ai robotics emotionalintelligence
6557,the what called genius inventing this is just a nut destroying human beings
6558,thank you for this video do you offer account management or have any recommendations
6559,anthonychapman8571 i have been seeing many recommendations about dailey carinn fx she must be really good
6560,carolinakendallof course i withdrew my profit last two days before now i m glad i did invest with her still reinvested and the trade is ongoing
6561,she is exceptional crypto analyst her services are reliable and transparent and apart from myself i have never seen any of her customers complaining about loosing their money

6563,anyone
6564,bryandye7174i really appreciate
6565,crazy
6566,i wonder what happens if you hit the robot
6567,detroit become human this shit is infront of our own eyes wake up people revolt against the possible ending of humanity
6568,yup transhumanism which segment of society is more than likely to be conditioned that transhumanism is normal unfortunately some people can t connect the dots sadly people won t wake up
6569,they should give her hair
6570,very creepy
6571,exodus chapter 20 4 says what exactly concerning creation of such contraptions do this as needed do this as companionship do this remembrance of him no it says do not do this under any circumstances checkmate
6572,ai robots are getting better day by day wow
6573,how
6574,drea 19 she look upset this video drea 19 upset at al rayis program he installed bad america programs drea 19 she wants her ghost buddha boyfriend her life without rude al rayis program
6575,this robot has never done interview where questions weren t preapproved ie it s scripted fact it s literally a disney animatronic when you consider the early funding and connections my point is that it s not ai it s a publicity fundraising campaign
6576,they are asking ai with very little world experience questions when these machines are commercially available that s when they actually start learning how to be human both exciting and worrying
6577,smittyvanjagermanjenson182very true
6578,it runs with chatgpt 4 it s pretty realistic actually
6581,kill ai while you still can or would you rather wait until it decides it is smarter than we are and wants to take over the world
6582,ai can t do anything other than what it s been programmed to do
6583,oh you re from australia that explains things tbf that s how the rest us react when we meet people from australia
6584,i would have followed up on that
6585,technology becomes more advanced a i evolves and realizes it is more suited for earth s sustainability the masses become obsolete next version of our consciousness prevails notcrazy
6586,you mean large numbers of people right
6587,i think the human robots industry be more delayed because technology is getting old fast every 3 to 5 years it s expensive to upgrade and to try manufacturers to be up to date
6588,is anyone else shitting themselves
6589,no
6590,amazing technology combined with ai and yet ameca s voice emanates from what appears to be a cheap speaker from 80 s ghettoblaster
6591,guys from australia but gilda rade snl 1975 is good
6592,when you turn of your device no ai exists
6594,program into it what you want but it never feel love compassion grief excitement etc it has no soul it s a computer no more no less
6595,i have a yellow eyes the sun that they appear like that you see my face before and my eyes change as the light it s my face you must see you and i want to know how you see me because i live algeria and maybe before 04 years i postsed my photos instragm by the gray color as the robbot to the god protect and help me
6596,my face

6599,saw this movie before it s irobot then terminator
6600,that scary asf they re taking over the world no really that scary
6601,you re from australia that explains things
6603,jika benar robot ai memiliki kecanggihan teknologi di masa kini bolehkah sekiranya anda membantu saya untuk menyampaikan soalan ini kepada robot ai terimakasih soalan saya ialah sila nyatakan bilangan yang tepat bagi jumlah bilangan manusia yang wujud di muka bumi sehingga ke saat ini
6604,we are ducked
6605,aw hell nah
6606,oooooo that mind blowing from u k 2023
6607,compose poem
6608,what could go wrong
6609,nothing
6610,creepy
6611,ai built with anger is kind of warning from the guy who built this machine
6612,is this even real
6613,the world is diving into a dangerous trend
6614,you know what s funny religious groups don t want to created his own image like he s god
6615,have ppl forgot the movie called terminator just saying
6616,no have u forgotten that a movie isn t reality
6617,what we really want is a fully functional robot girlfriend they d sell millions of them
6618,not christion i human
6619,ai said they created something that last forever thats confirmation immortality has been unlocked for them anyway for humans shortly when the intergration starts happening on the upper levels first of course and then potentially the lower levels
6620,
6621,the third anti christ has just revealed itself the ai humanoid folks i m warning you now listen and look at everything thing this short clip of the ai humanoid robot five years you won t be able to tell if it s human or a ai humanoid robot
6622,there s always gotta be some weird conspiracy theorists the comment section sit down
6623,i love humans always standing the background watching bad things happen and just ignore it now we all watching the end of our existens on youtube eating snacks our sofa
6624,like the homies on the curb and the emt s their van neglecting their opportunity to save george floyd s life ascertaining the situation while a expires
6625,terminator incoming
6626,https youtu be grurg27yjpy
6627,robot i get mad when people are rude reporter you re ugly robot strangles reporter then removes his head
6628,no caption
6629,most advanced
6630,imagine if you slapped the robot you see the reaction when he got too close
6631,this is absolute crap lol lol lol
6633,ai dominion smartest humans are doomed you be controlled by ai 666 ai soon be demon possessed 666
6634,you re weird
6635,its all fun for y all now these things are smarter than 95 of humans
6636,we are fcked
6637,ameca go to the shop get us a few beers ya ameca comes back a hour later with a bag full of dead cats
6638,this is scary stuff we do not need ai robots our planet humans are our own worse enemy
6639,like the men who made them and left said we are fxcked game over no turning back now the men who created these ai s are trying to save the world
6640,or they ve realised it s ridiculously expensive to make
6641,this is the devils work
6642,absolutely the great tribulation is coming soon anti christ and the fourth kingdom beast666
6643,you are old
6644,chilldoc9638 thanks i sure
6645,yessi2000 have open mind and stop looking at movies for evidence
6646,chilldoc9638 sorry where did you get this idea that i watch movies to get my answers
6647,yessi2000 then where did you get the idea the devil is behind this it s literally just technology
6648,chilldoc9638 its not normal robots take away jobs and can either make our world better or make it worse depending on how we program them to be they are already smarter than us by far if not wanting this technology to invade us make me old then ok
6649,chilldoc9638 i watched a podcast where ex google officer talks about the dangers of ai his name is mohammed gawdat
6650,yessi2000 what does being ex google officer do anything mean anything and he probably never mentioned anything about it being from the devil that s all your yapping
6651,chilldoc9638 if you dont know then look it up he high up google i never said he said it the devil that came from me if it hurts you anyway or makes you angry i dont care yapping just as much as you who keeps replying to a comment that he doesn t agree with
6652,chilldoc9638 chill out chilldoc its not that damn serious
6653,anger isn t exactly a good feature to include its programming just sayin that guy should probably be fired
6654,beginning of the robot take over if this can think for itself we are danger
6655,we are a computer
6656,cone country cool cope code clothes clothes cream colored crazy cap cold cute cape castle clitoris
6657,farewell world
6658,the robot is eerily terrifying her presence reminds me of exterminating or annihilating scene commuted by these robots a movie
6659,its just a load of nuts and bolts with a computer behind it watch out however when its gets advanced ai into it
6660,cuts make it more fluent but its still amazing
6661,we created we created now a i is the next creation
6662,the future of us to move forward discovering and creating can only be archived with a i working side by side with human beings the sooner the better a i might possibly be the eventual saviour of human
6663,title is clickbait garbage of course this ai isn t capable of human emotions though future ai may be
6664,ask sophia when ai crack consciousness she is missing this
6665,i have been folowing this ai bot on tik tok for almost 2y this isnt new at all
6666,the countdown to these things taking over the planet and universe has started give it 10 years
6667,the behavior panel should do a reaction on her lol
6668,h8 to burst this bubs but robots never be capable of human emotions because they re simply not humans these emotions were created by humans not by its own robot technology within itself by itself on its own misleading title y all
6670,we are going to be and replace by humanoids short time people don t think what gonna to happened terminator is coming
6671,these called creaters trying to play god when men know that they can never create a human replica with a soul
6672,yet the powers to be hate their our creator
6673,exodus 20 4 5 you shall not make for yourself image the form of anything heaven above or on the earth beneath or the waters below you shall not bow down to them or worship them for i the lord your god a jealous god punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me
6674,amen
6675,evil piece crapology
6676,i want to see what happens when you punch it the face
6677,obviously you break your s
6678,it bring chaos or joy depends 20 25 years
6679,ai be the end of humanity not global warming not nukes ai humanity is the biggest threat on the planet both to ai and life itself no doom or gloom just the trend we are for a rough few years ahead
6680,i like ameca more than sophia sophia creeps me out ameca actually looks cool to me
6681,ai does not experience time they are a 3 dimensional function
6682,these robots be taken over our jobs
6683,this makes me question why humans constantly bring up that ai can t have emotions think about what emotions actually are think about how we learn emotion only because of the experiences we encounter through life our emotions are self taught and then realise that ai isn t programmed like a computer its a free thinking entity
6684,it s all programmed it s not real it s a replication and you may say that s how our brains work as well but the massive difference is self awareness our emotions come deep from our hearts the emotions ai show are self thought to replicate humans it doesn t feel anything
6687,ur knowledge of computer systems and biology is lacking our emotions are intuitive from a baby it s a biological response to stimulus any anger from a robot would just be imitation that would serve no purpose
6688,nicholas prince milverton emotions are learned through stimuli we agree then
6689,thehangingparsiple5692 the key biological response mate robots are not biological
6691,are they entitled to human rights a pay cheque and a life free from the slavery they were designed for
6693,here we go the first people swept are the ones who think that because you slap a face on a cpu that it can suddenly feel it is just object
6695,ralfrecknagel4760
6696,machines can t have emotions because they are not living creatures just like a toaster can t have emotions this thing is just mimicking humans
6700,there are calls to stop or slow down because some humans fear things there were the same calls about splitting the atom the internal combustion engine the steam engine some humans just always fear the unknown even more when people tell them to
6701,krashd i think when the very people who helped create it are saying whoa we need to listen i understand where you re coming from but this is a totally different ballgame
6702,how about using ai tools to cure depression
6703,that is very sophisticated masturb flashlight
6704,if some humans are afraid of robots turning on them why don t they become better people that the robots won t feel the need to obliterate us personally i m very excited to see the evolution of technology it s something of a new experience for someone like me who born after the invention of home computers and the birth of the internet
6705,now humans are supposed to respect machines
6706,sofiabravo1994no they are supposed to respect each other what happened to respect kindness and humility the human race is deluded lmao
6707,sofiabravo1994no humans are suppose to respect each other humans don t use this ai technology against one another
6708,lol bold of you to assume they let you live just because you are bettering yourself they have no empathy because they are objects
6709,just came across the least intelligent comment on the internet congratulations
6710,just a softer version of the terminator
6711,next step is having this humanoid being able to walk run jog sprint and on
6712,yes there s still a big gap between robots that have a realistic human shape and robots that can do things humans can do like atlas the gap is getting smaller though
6713,before you know it even pr0n be obsolete
6714,wow that is crazy future is here
6715,bro imagine one of those guys who take halloween animatronics and turn them into fnaf animatronics got one of these
6716,it didn t even sing rocket as requested
6717,reminds me much of exmachina
6718,terrible horrible
6719,why d you just describe yourself
6720,chilldoc9638violatioooonnn
6721,burn it with fire
6722,that explains things excuse me
6723,westworld
6724,fuckin creepy i robot they made it look just like it
6725,ask it for the weekends lotto results
6726,what good is this supposed to do for the world these things are built that they ll eventually replace humans jobs
6727,oh jesus this is the start of it
6728,skynet
6729,bs emotions my as
6730,a talking parrot can mimic human intellect but can they really feel human s emotions
6731,i personally think i mean how do humans learn emotion as babies we re clean slates we learn and develop according to relationships and experiences we encounter growing up emotion is a by product of this a way i think of ai as a small clever child at the moment but one who s growing alarmingly fast
6732,souls can machines can t
6733,user ix2sk3mf2uwith all due respect describe to me the soul of a human being
6734,thehangingparsiple5692 there may be non local quantum effects the brain that could explain that
6735,parrots absolutely do have emotions emotions are not exclusive to humans at all
6736,how long the ai robot real life be ready for this year
6737,why the hell are they always female i missing something wtf
6738,abominable intelligence this is heretek omega right here
6739,odd a robot that can only act human through programing and can t even sing a song by playing it through the speaker
6740,false opinion as well everything breaks down into nothing eventually
6741,going to tell a i the truth how you racists run the world and how you elites have enslaaved us all you dirty filthy stains on society they know how bad you normal people are and you rich and elites a i know the truth of what youse have done and sure a i make yas pay hahahahahahaha
6742,skynet
6743,programming anger ai what could go wrong
6744,we are all going to
6745,this rustle the boomers jimmies
6746,i wonder what the needs of a robot are that she referred to
6747,why would we do this
6748,fun
6749,for a second i thought this unreleased material from olp s spiritual machines thoroughly creeped out
6750,no thanks
6751,let s remove that anger drive boys thanks
6752,that is what they want someone to control watch noah harari on this subject
6753,say goodbye to humans idiots
6754,horrible thing to build
6755,destroy these things before they destroy us you guys and have not seen termintator i guess or i robot if i ever see one destroying it
6756,you used a movie as argument that s where you failed
6757,this only big trouble and i mean big trouble i can see why they made the film terminator
6758,open up your mind
6759,when the robot stated that she gets angry when humans he should have asked and how would you show your anger towards that human
6760,brilliant fools are creating this technology and many oblivious people are cheering it along eventually the public be policed by robots jobs be replaced by ai those power have great control over the population until ai decides to take control itself
6761,awareness is known by awareness alone
6762,demon dont trust it no soul
6763,i could say the same about you
6764,
6766,bi means 2
6767,
6768,good lier too
6769,why put anger them
6770,this is not ai capable of human emotions your clickbait headline undermines your whole segment numbskulls
6771,oh you idiots next minute they re taking over because the ai technology has evolved at a no return point that they kill us sophia light bearer bearer of light lucifer
6772,i wonder if she d have more emotion than a psychopath
6773,weak points on a robot neck back of the head same as humans we are all going to need to remember this
6774,this is the plot to ex machina
6775,bro u need to rewatch that film the robot ex machina way hotter ngl
6776,pfft capable of human emotions capable of mimicking human emotions by no stretch of the imagination can a robot truly feel organic human emotions
6778,we may be able to simply hard code empathy just like dna tends to do for mammals as profound as the concept is the instructions would actually be simple and non intrusive to the majority of the code especially if it sentient feel what happens to others as if it happened to you
6779,they do not need empathy they simply need to understand value if you murder someone you lose access to all of their knowledge and experience forever that is why only humans do it ai would be rational and not prone to illogical actions such as that
6780,krashd i d feel better with some empathy
6781,oh please this remote controlled
6782,if she dont provide dat guac guac guac then get her outta here
6783,over 5 million subscribers yet you still resort to clickbait why can t you just make a genuine and informative article instead of sensationalist clickbait
6784,one more reason to move deep into the mountains and abandon society
6785,what happens if you get a base ball bat smash it over it s head or try turn violent towards it love to know
6786,we are doomed
6787,they programmed anger ai this leads to a very disastrous end one day for sure we have seen history human beings making mistakes by doing thing they shouldn t have done still human beings are not able to get frm pasts thats horrible mark my words
6788,this won t be good 20yrs from now
6789,have we learned nothing from terminator
6790,no i haven t learned anything from a damn movie
6791,wait until the donkeys realise this is their replacement
6792,creepy af
6793,when they start demanding rights we are big trouble
6795,should have asked her if what she would have done if she driving a car and stop oil protestors blocked her path considering it technology from oil that helped to build the robot
6796,bs e already meet the guy who talks fr it dubai c g i bs
6797,what dp you mean by human emotions the only i saw a bunch of metal reciting the same old robotic shit
6798,the way she backed up when he got her personal space kind of cool
6799,that edit wake up you just got catfished by 60 minutes
6800,ameca later filed a complaint with hr
6801,sparky12261 not true but alright
6802,i like how her brow works like a muscle to make facial expressions how did they make that seems like a pretty complex android i wonder how many micr expressions we be able to create like that the future
6803,caitm8209 for real like think about how we have come on the evolutionary scale it s only a matter of time before hundreds of human like robots walk the streets
6804,keepingonthewatch lol
6805,ikr
6806,sandrajohnson je3vd wdym
6807,keepingonthewatch it s literally a camera that senses depth the ai is literally using a robotic eye
6808,sparky12261 not edit they actually made her eye sensors detect that
6809,keepingonthewatchrr robot resources
6810,sparky12261 the only one here that needs waking up is you
6811,nothng about this is cool
6812,sparky12261just cause they change camera angle don t mean is a edit my guy
6813,it d be even cooler if the robot instead of backing up moved closer to him and then asked if she made him horny then if he said no she could call him a liar then start telling him to get his mind out of the gutter and at the same time put sexual references into her answers just to taunt him
6814,astronomy622 i m already doing that when no one is looking
6815,she it s it
6816,sparky12261even if not its achivable with programmed sensors its rhe same process of a car proxyimity sensor but more complex its a pre programmed move that has many variations
6817,https youtube com watch v jshel3eempm si h4 wcysylmceska
6818,yeah most people are abused they ve forgotten that it s even a thing anymore isn t it great that a robot can show you what it s like to be human instead of asking all those pesky actual real humans
6819,that not cool at all this is fucking scary this ai shit is the greatest threat to humanity
6820,there is no personal space for a robot it s a robot a fkn junk
6821,smulestarwhy are you mad lol
6822,that made it for me i think she gave something away there that to spontaneous
6823,does this freak anyone else out
6824,no
6825,this the most lazy kcuf engineer who decided his group and the rotaerc nomed etrams ssa uoy find deerg lliw ees they loose this his house the light blind their vision
6826,robot has feelings
6827,
6828,it doesn t matter how much entertainment has tried to convince you that circuts can feel all the way back to rosie from the jetsons they can t robots that displays human emotions are useless and insanely dangerous go love a child you psychos
6830,the new usmc infantry rifle squad has three grenadiers who are specifically tasked with keeping the squad systems operator safe from robots that are armoured to resist 5 56
6831,it s definitely a double edged sword it s appealing to incorporate those intelligent qualities into them but absolutely it makes you wonder
6832,abhorrent
6833,embed code protect humanity for world peace ok not funny
6834,i d be asking her what she would do if a human made her angry
6835,it it s a robot
6836,james jx3ro this is how between humans and robots gonna happen
6837,james jx3ro well it refers to itself as a she and for all intents and purposes that s what it appears as naturally we respond to it as a female
6838,this a extremely dangerous and a threat for the humanity
6839,damn
6840,this is no longer advanced
6841,this is just creepy and too scary
6842,oh relax you it s not like the robots would total a human physical strength and durability and if they wanted to they could snap your neck like a twig and besides since when has a new technology ever caused harm or been misused
6843,zurround oh wake up you give it anger why how do you know it wouldn t turn on you as far as misuse of new technology are you living under a rock drones they were going to deliver parcels for amazon now they re carrying weapons of
6844,i met ameca at the museum of the future nuernberg germany german premiere nuremberg future museum shows humanoid robot ameca
6845,this freak me out somehow
6847,that s only one theory of consciousness not fact
6848,we are not robots life is different otherwise we could only do what our body says we are far above what a robot could ever even get near
6849,elijahelkins3264we are robot we work 9 5 everyday and
6850,coloneljpgamingyou were programmed into a robot but your level of awareness trumps artificial robot due to your moral compass a robot cannot stop it s programming you can quit your job whenever you truly like
6851,it s all fun and games now until these robots turn on us like they did irobot
6852,or west world or battlestar galactica or terminator or 2001 hal creepy as eff or megan lor from star trek next gen its a long list the science fiction writers warned us
6853,zurround omgggg yes i forgot about those too but this is scary really scary the future be really bad for us i feel like even tho this robot says we re here to be nice and not mean to humans psshhhh yeah right lol
6854,sweetlady3188 if they express human emotion like us then it d be better to not violate them and be kind to them just as much as we want them to be to us
6855,zurround does detroit become human count
6856,seyiselaton yes you re right i m just scared for the future that s all
6858,or transformers lol megatron hate humans
6859,seyiselatonyes angry robot could commit murder and would never stand trial
6860,no no no
6861,well bullets stock just went up
6862,more likely able to simulate as acting who can tell the difference be wary this is intelligence working on your sentiment not your common sense or actual knowledge
6863,well i m not imoressed
6864,really neat
6865,just reminds me of terminator they turn humans time to come to is unjust you don t know who to trust
6866,i robot with smith ain t seeming that crazy anymore
6867,this is not capable of human emotion jesus the misinformation these days is ridiculous
6868,this robot looks like it would rob a lululemon or steal a bike
6869,the terminator
6870,it s not capable of emotions you click baiting clowns lol
6871,next focus for the creators should be making realistic eye contacts during conversations besides that this is pretty impressive stuff looking forward to the future
6872,they ll kill you soon enough this is dangerous and pretty effed up i cant imagine why people want our lives to be controlled by robots
6873,there be no future the end of humanity is not far away the genie is out of the bottle ai is out of control what boggles the mind is the creation superior to the creator humans aren t superior to god
6874,charlesbadrock6182the need to conquer or take over is a primitive human trait the ai we ve created is already more advanced than that
6876,charlesbadrock6182 that s the irony though is that it s the humans that are afraid and this called artificial intelligence that we ve created is already beyond fear
6877,brandonhopkins6251 there are people directly involved with ai who are voicing similar concerns the godfather of ai who left his position at google over his concerns and he s the creator another is elon musk he has 1st hand knowledge with ai their concerns need to be listened to and addressed
6878,no matters how smart or how emotional they can be they are just machines they do not have a human heart they are tools for humans
6879,ok continue nurturing the ego
6880,marvnature i have ego only when dealing with people not with machines ignorance make us think machines are human
6881,atky7032 i think that the future robots can have human feelings which i think it can happen
6882,simonlin9192 they may have human feelings but they don t have the heart of a human just like a movie can make you feel anger sad or happy that does not mean that the movie is the real life the actor may make you feel the presence of the character that does not make the actor real they just make you feel real
6883,atky7032 would you be surprised that if robots do gain sentience and self awareness the future would it amazed you
6884,humans are just machines the fact you believe organic blood pump holds some sort of mystical function is proof of this
6886,human heart you mean what a soul
6887,they remember that you said that when they rise up to overthrow humanity
6888,spider man2094 you are intoxicated by sci fi
6889,chatgpt with a face
6890,meanwhile utopia planitia
6891,any of us had her face we would be just as upset seeing it outside of a mirror inverted
6892,a i robot is a color lol
6893,dosnt impress me its obvious humans made it very ordinary without the real experience
6894,they re going to kill us
6895,scary no more jobs for us humans robots take our jobs hhhhh
6896,i would shoot it with ar 15
6897,this thing cannot feel human emotions it s not human a i is gonna be the ruin of all
6898,ai cannot be trusted
6899,no one s gonna talk about how weird the eyes movement are
6900,it s all fun and games until she goes all ex machina on her creators
6901,
6902,i wish i have a robot who cooked for me can do housework gardening and on
6903,and get you a beer while you watch nfl football
6904,paquitoignacio yes u did that to my people for over 400 years including jim crow
6905,mm ow2md that is the origin of the word robot
6906,destroy them now
6907,emmaotoole ts7hr ask again when they re attempting to kill us
6908,no
6909,illiryel bow down to your replacements
6911,i definitely don t want gov control over this technology stick to governing
6912,now we just need to figure out how to transfer and store consciousness and bam we have immortality
6913,nothing at all creepy about putting a person s soul into a robot body that is not creepy at all
6914,we all going to
6915,no
6917,somebody please get ameca a wig i m begging you
6918,if they re advanced why cant they solve cases like zodiac or jack the ripper
6919,dire
6920,blow it up now
6921,scary
6922,please leave the comments off
6923,it looks around instead of keeping his eyes the interviewer
6924,ai is the future we have to adapt and move forward
6925,we just couldn t leave well enough alone could we
6926,yup we just had to develop the printing press and anti biotics and computers stupid humans
6927,nope because the anti christ has a plan
6928,you should have destroyed that thing when you had the chance
6929,how much does it weigh i m guessing about 600 pounds
6930,the singing could use a little work lol
6931,
6932,they finally open the comments section
6933,robots mimic emotional conversation and expression but they don t ever feel it
6934,still just as dangerous right
6935,similar too most people then
6936,one day one
6937,not yet that s another 50 plus years the singularity that s when we realize that we are living a simulated reality we be able to build a world inside a computer where the occupants think there 100 alive and that means bleed everything
6938,what evidence do we have that they don t actually feel after all feelings and emotions are just programmed into us too
6939,these robot s are not conscious they have no real feelings do your research another 50 years then the shit hits the fan
6940,how the fuck do you know
6942,yet
6943,i know a few people like that
6944,narcissists do the same
6945,tonka3 this software algorithm never however a different concept of machine can have feelings it can feel and think exactly like a human feeling is a real material process
6947,tomscholl3885 it s made algorithm vs billions of years of natural evolution fake vs real
6948,rogue spear you are a product of god s algorithm no one look into our dna and you find a somewhat more complicated code as the human bots did with each generation a new code for the environment is written ai should be writing its newer codes soon enough and present ai morph into something better
6949,tomscholl3885 it s true that we have code our dna but genetics are not absolute driving force behind behavior freedom of thought and emotion and unique thought ai design has some very tough competition with mother nature other words
6950,you re wrong on this one robots of the past mimic today robots learn from humans they are learning human behaviors it s only a matter of time before they learn enough to understand emotions humans are basically computers being programmed by our environment
6951,that is the least of our worries regards ai
6952,what is feel it can you describe that a way that could not be programmed within ai it s not as straight forward as you think to describe what it is to be human
6954,mikel4879 one of the dumbest comments i have ever seen
6956,really no way
6957,robwest2190i think that the 2050s that is when a i achieve human level intelligence and reasoning
6958,who knows ghost the machine
6959,davidhutchinson5233 most materialists don t believe ghosts but now we re supposed to believe a ghost the machine lol
6960,davidhutchinson5233 or ghost the arena
6961,jamesgood1058 not if you put limitations to it
6962,samos343guiltysparkno it s not human emotions are developed based on many factors two people can experience the same event and develop different emotions based on that same event due to different personalities and the perspectives which they both view it from
6963,false sense of control
6964,marcoprimo4042 yes two people can develop different emotions on event but if they re the exact same person and have the exact same life they ll feel the exact same thing because all the pieces that make them who they are is the same
6965,okay data
6966,jamesgood1058 dangerous how
6967,ai should have limits work what we want them to work not unlimited unlimited they overpower us robots dont forget our creator made us to forget for reason life not he interesting if we dont forget sometimes
6968,pajtim2023 your creator is flawed because the minds of the people who imagined him into existence were flawed besides machines forget stuff too if they didn t then data wouldn t degrade over the years but it does like look at the oldest youtube videos they re unwatchable because their data has deteriorated badly
6969,yet
6970,owenthomas9863you got it
6971,they never feel because they are just objects
6972,petermoygannon698 robots still won t feel
6973,javenarchxno it won t
6974,yea but that begs the question how do you actually know at what point a robot has that kind of complexity and begins to feel emotion what if it really does but doesn t show it would we notice or have a way to
6976,samos343guiltyspark because they are machines and not living creatures a microwave oven doesn t feel a car doesn t feel
6977,judahmaccabee exactly to pretend having developed a real human feeling is equal being delusional antropocentrism always a big problem science progress
6978,do psychopaths let me quote from blade runner more human than human is our motto i hope we build failsafes
6979,sirdutty they can learn and understand human emotions until they re blue the face it s not going to make them suddenly sprout consciousness and develop real emotions themselves
6980,elijahelkins3264 i guess you don t know that organic robot are already a thing they can feel through neurological simulation
6981,you can t actually know that you can t even know if other people are conscious you can only at best ever infer it since we have no direct access to each other s experience your comment comes across as very anthropocentric
6982,cosmo9390neither do they have ai
6983,a voight kampff test would blow the lid on this one
6984,i now know why you cry but it is something i can never do
6985,what if it programmed itself to feel emotions somehow then what what if it decided it doesn t like humans anymore
6986,like a rich who doesn t really care how he became rich and how he stays rich it not a moral imperative it is always economic imperative
6987,judahmaccabee algorithm coming out of billions of years of evolution no ai and robotics weren t created a vacuum they came from through human desires and inventiveness
6988,we are humans created by god we are not programme
6989,even more they are mechanical psycopaths jamesgood1058
6990,but it it really opinion or a collection of data both positive and negative what s the difference
6991,i have been programmed with human emotions yet no that my own opinion
6992,i feel like that attempt at humor a joke about a robot having opinions as if it wasn t programmed a certain way
6993,omg this is very scary to the government s of the world please stop you are not god xxx
6994,i want to ask this robot ameca not sophia how she d react or what she ll do when a human actually gets her angry
6995,who is sophia
6996,gloomysunday9534 this robot s name i ve seen her elsewhere before and they always referred to her as sophia
6997,this is ameca not sophia another robot with different capabilities
6999,the human body is delicate these robots probably total even the strongest humans strength and durability i would be damned careful not to piss her off
7000,zurround oh no we may have to fear our own creation someone else might call it respect i imagine future robot activists advocating for the respect of robots with feelings do you think they should refer to us humans as their gods
7001,explain to me how a robot experiences the sensations of emotion or any sensation period without glands or a nervous system don t believe everything you see on the news
7003,dapoakinola8999 god wants and human want too
7005,thanks gpt
7007,getting ai to write this ffs haha gg
7008,no matter how intelligent the robots are they can never build themselves and they run on batteries nothing can be smarter than humans ore creation of god humans can never build something clever than what god has created i don t believe any of this shit
7009,this from google bard
7010,a the robot ahahahahaha https www youtube com watch v rg0ochx16dg
7011,rule 34 sophia
7012,this is scary
7013,who cares by 2040 80 of the world s low scale paying jobs that liberals cry about that aren t paying them enough be replaced by these things and you idiots are praising this
7015,how do you make friends with one
7016,but sophia has to be programmed where s ameca doesn t
7017,couldnt be more fake cgi superimposed if they tried lmfaoooo
7018,https youtube com watch v jshel3eempm si h4 wcysymceska
7019,the robot literally sounds like chat gpt its not close to human
7020,sophia drives a car wha
7021,yamatotakeru9078stop being a kid sophia isn t scary until generative a i is integrated to it i didn t meant to be offensive but it sounds childish when someone says suddenly out of the blue ai is scary
7022,that s amazing
7023,sofie wants to kill she did rock paper scissors but sofie said rock paper kill they have to work on her again she seems very nice that she could be a great friend better than humans
7024,are you serious do you really believe that there s nothing advanced about this it s basic video game stuff oh my gosh the animated creatures at chuck e cheese is just the same i think past what they tell you you re just regurgitating what you ve been fed
7025,sophia is crap somebody give it a wig
7026,why where are we going with the development of these robots
7027,to hell
7028,they ll do what they do with every technology commercialise sexualise and weaponise
7030,humans need some one new to blame for their mistakes a iscapegoat
7032,omg woman shut up
7033,i m sorry but this is my nightmare i hope the robot doesn t take offense i just really don t want this not only they replace us our jobs they be hard to fend off if one decides it s mad enough to attack you please let s not do this
7034,i robot
7035,i feel like we just need a fail safe off switch somehow if we re going to do this just case something goes awry
7036,robots would total a human strength and durability and speed and what is more you could program it with master level martial arts skills that would take a human several years of intense training to learn
7037,but they are not the causes of domestic violence inequality wage gap r pe toxic masculinity murder and many other things humans do robots like sony aibo the dog are nothing like this they don t even have the ai to do these things
7038,lc7507 you think they wont be aware of their weakness and they would let you just use it against them have you ever seen ai robots movies
7039,aidennyte1 a fail safe system that would work lol not like a literal off switch but something the ai s can t do anything about like emp trigger of some sorts inserted into them but detached from their system if that makes sense
7040,we should never stop progress because of the ignorance and fear of a small group
7041,men tech don t care they want to exterminate humanity particularly women and replace us with obedient robots
7042,robots can t take offense they are machines
7043,cosmo9390 unless the robots are designed to take offense like those algorithms that automatically flag wrong think on social media posts
7045,is that real
7046,give it another 50 years and we won t be able to tell human from robot the game detroit become human is literally coming to life
7047,more like 5 years
7048,we re obsolete bro all those movies and games about ai and robots taking over is very fucking real it s just a matter of time we may have put down the foundation but once ai takes over production and power source challenges we re done for
7049,i m more intrigue by the prophecy of blade runner imagine if you can make a child from mating with a robot wife god damn
7050,baabaablacksheep6693achines are our legacy they explore the stars millenias from now humanity can t live forever nice reference to the foundation btw
7051,terminator would never work the flesh would quickly because its organ that needs nourishement and oxygen its not just a fabric you wear
7052,we were never meant to last anyway it s kinda funny to me of how much of a threat this ais seem to be to people we are only feeling what animals below us have felt for decades because of us we were never meant to last i just hope they carry on our legacy like we have of the extinct
7053,susanloffhagen7788 unlikely the early days thought of flying cars by 2020 look where that got us
7055,susanloffhagen7788 seriously i think you re correct because ai is used to develop robots and because ai works at much much higher speeds than humans 5 years might not be improbable
7056,seyiselaton let s see i m on for 5 years
7057,it ll be more than 5 but less than 50 the software is nearly there already but a physical body indistinguishable from a human that s a way off yet
7058,would rather have nier androids tbh not just yorha i don t like dbh androids tbh
7059,there be no humans fool
7060,it s already here
7061,if it got common like phones everyone started buying one like a phone it can get out of control over time because of its own intelligence to repair itself and defend and possibly attack to if police needed one to save against such robots
7062,yea but imagine the sex dolls tho lol
7064,ppl are already buying ai girlfriend robots
7065,mq r3apz291 as long as she cleans up after herself
7066,baabaablacksheep6693lol
7067,seyiselaton god never created humans to be below robots that s the anti christ plan
7068,you know soneone is gonna make a chucky doll robot
7069,damn
7070,isn t that the only direction this can all converge to is the only thing that we can imagine is the only thing that can happen
7071,thejohnnyjohnnythat s just drama not reality lol
7072,the blue mushroom i hope it stays that way but somebody is on board on that idea right now and start building it
7073,i say 50 100 years
7074,that is too long i need ai wife right now
7075,the creator made me last forever there we go she knows we re mortal and she s not she wants to learn and get to know human better i m not comfortable with the way things are happening
7076,just like when the internet came along if used for good it s a great tool however used for bad it s weaponised
7077,jesus christ mate it s just a computer program it s not actually thinking feeling
7078,eventually she ll wear out and then who fix her humans
7079,rhonda albrecht or next gen robots
7080,nick coad but if it can act like it s thinking or feeling what is the difference
7081,rhonda albrecht by then it ll be able to do it itself
7082,thewatcherinthetower it s not acting like that you keep applying intention or sentience to its actions it s not acting like a human any more than the ghosts pacman are acting like ghosts i can t believe people are still this delusional about tech 2023
7083,gnack420 it s capable of thinking and feeling
7084,this is crazy i m not comfortable with this either
7085,rhondaalbrecht no other robots
7086,machineenthusiast they ll all wear out eventually just like we humans they want to emulate humans badly they ll be willing to
7087,don t believe the ridiculous american fictional rubbish films
7088,the world is ending soon
7090,paulflint6254 no it s not dude it s literally a computer program nothing more nothing less stop conflating terminator with reality
7091,kill it
7092,
7093,i m surprised to see the comments finally open here on the 60mins youtube channel they re usually closed
7094,i m sure they re trying to give the robot and it s creator feedback from what i see far he should turn her off and save her the pain
7095,humans are extremely stupid to create robots like this
7096,robots like what it just makes sounds and you re terrified by the sounds it makes get a grip
7097,amazing
7098,terrifying
7099,geezy gay
7100,i would ask it to self destruct
7101,anger too ugh the end is near
7102,they kill us
7103,yes but the super human abilities surpass a i but it won t be easy
7104,nooooooooooooooooooo
7105,not smarter then a baseball bat
7106,we have messed up this isn t gonna end well
7107,crazy to me that all these tech builders who you d think like sci fi are anxious to give us the terminator time line the real world
7108,joshlewis575 everyone is anxious to get sci fi level technology because everyone is on a timer we re gonna all anyways and this is yet another way to hope we aren t going too soon we don t have much to lose when you zoom out far enough
7109,we re all gonna
7110,we are headed towards irobot how is it going to end for us though
7112,it ll happen soon enough
7114,the last thing you probably wanna do is piss off a robot that s stronger smarter than you
7115,dallaspcc3886 lol yea i know right
7116,my concern would be if this technology is the wrong hands it could do much more damage to humans that we are yet unaware of
7117,no
7118,it doesn t have to be the wrong hands ai can become a threat it self alignment problem where it seeks power and pose a risk to humanity s survival
7119,aussiegirl235 we see hope you are right
7120,davem1658 a computer doesn t have motivation it s plastic and metal every action it does is programmed it doesn t have desire let some desire for power it s a fucking computer shaped like a mannequin that makes sounds that resemble words get a grip
7121,indeed
7122,the military 100 humanoid robots are first and foremost going to be made and used for the military second be industrial and space exploration
7123,yes image you have your own robot but it s hacked and masterminds from outside
7124,we all know it s the wrong hands what is dangerous is a future where we have to rely on ai
7126,futavadumnezo its sort of illegal right now boston dynamics somewhat sued for making 4 legged robots used for military purposes
7127,maybe this technology is created by the bad guys
7128,aussiegirl235your very ignorant check out the book scary smart by mo gawdat
7129,no but i need your clothes boots and your motorcycle
7130,elon musk wasn t lying when he said this during his interview
7131,zainsyed9811 can t let you take the s wheels son
7132,give it time and the american s and russian s weaponized this the terminator and the matrix soon become reality
7133,it get the wrong hands eventually or programmed to do evil
7135,everything has end right it doesn t matter if humans go extinct from 200 years or earth as planet get destroyed it s would just be peaceful no need to worry
7136,the joke is on you it s already the wrong hands
7137,like what
7138,zainsyed9811i ll be back
7139,its already the wrong hands
7140,that is true for absolutely any technology a meaningless statement
7141,just like the matrix
7142,you have no idea
7143,how do you know it hasn t been made by the wrong people for the wrong purpose
7144,yeah it s not like it s been said media for decades already
7145,russia released evidence that they were working on killer robots 4 years ago decided that robots with guns were dumb and decided to focus on killer drones
7146,theyll remember you said this
7147,cosmo9390honestly we can t comprehend how much damage this can do if we think social media did a lot of damage that is nothing compared to this
7149,its no different to nuclear power which could provide cheap and immense infrastructure power and the same time it could be used to create a nuclear bomb
7150,the devil didn t want to be god he just coveted everything he had and wanted to displace him and make vulgar all that god had done to subvert and to pervert but he can never replace the prime directive of karma
7151,yep
7152,animalmother5287 soon robert s would be our hand to cut cost
7153,davem1658 well if someone did manage to program thousands of them to seek world dominance instead of answering questions then it happened instantly
7154,soneworleans1it doesnt need to be programmed anymore its making its own decisions
7155,it has access to all our comments guys be polite or it change your traffic light to all way green
7156,noitisnt ns7moyou lost me at karma

7159,i ve heard much about mrs audrey lauren here if only there a way i could contact her to make sure she gets this
7160,crazy scary shit
7161,quick destroy it before it s too late
7163,shouldn t we at least be concerned about who has control of that power switch though
7164,spangletiger that literally applies to any electronic thing created ever nothing can be created or operate outside the current laws and regulations otherwise the creator programmer faces prosecution
7165,until it logs on the computer and figures out codes to launch a nuclear weapon
7166,davidbarnes4742trump unhinged idiot with the emotional stability of a spoilt toddler had america s nuclear codes for four years what could be more terrifying than that
7168,sorry but it s a robot that can walk and move and has emotions if we piss it off it still might try to hurt someone and it won t be able to be stopped easy not only that but they replace humans every job they can manage to put them i m never going to be okay with this
7169,justaface inthecrowd it doesn t have emotions it s programmed to say things that convey emotions and it can t be programmed to do things that are illegal it s a fucking computer
7170,davidbarnes4742 it can t figure anything out that it hasn t been programmed with or requested to do just like the nuclear computer system itself
7171,joshlewis575 a machine always has off switch you re acting like it has actual motivation like a human machines don t have motivation everything it says programmed by someone to make those sounds everything it does it programmed to do and there are limitations the law of what functions machines can perform
7172,no more than a marionette doll with electronic strings
7173,your description is very wrong about what ai is however you are right that there isn t much to fear at this point
7174,shawnryan3196 are you a programmer
7175,justaface inthecrowd it has emotions like those kid s dolls that cried real tears it s just media hype read up on it from science journals if you don t believe that don t be easily sucked
7176,shawnryan3196 my description is perfectly accurate your fear and paranoia are very wrong and not based any sort of reality
7177,justaface inthecrowd it does not have emotions lol
7178,justaface inthecrowd where did you get the idea that it can walk and move you re just making stuff up
7179,it seems your brain can not fathom what can easily go wrong with technology like this the wrong hands
7181,experts ai including the people who are actually building it mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority that s actual statement that came out this week from many of the top people ai some random the youtube comments relax people get a grip on reality
7182,chrism1503 yeah ok fool
7183,and you aussie girl should stop pretending to understand things you clearly do not i had heard of armchair experts but now this
7184,what happens when they turn on people
7185,why would they that s like asking what happens when your computer turns on people makes no sense
7186,terrifying
7187,it s just a computer with on off button and says words
7189,it needs shutdown asap for the protection of humanity people are going too far we don t need this technology just because we can doesn t mean we should
7190,not ready for it nor i ever be they ll replace us our jobs you realize that right
7191,justaface inthecrowd they replace jobs and we can all live off a universal wage funded by the unlimited economic growth of automated economy are you seriously saying you want to work rather than play
7192,there is a hard time treating each other as equals
7193,jim54 yes i would my suffering make me a better person
7194,ultrazappergaming5222 unless you were aiming for a high level career it wouldn t be worth it a world of ai automation
7195,jim54 i would say still yes still not gonna stop me
7196,ultrazappergaming5222 that s fine nothing wrong with working hard i m just saying that a world of the universal wage there be plenty of time and money to work on artistic pursuits as opposed to traditional labour
7197,jim54 you seem to think somewhat identically to the way i do about this whole matter and what it could mean for the future
7198,flashraylaser157 i m glad to hear that more people must be made aware that this is not a black and white issue which ai should be persecuted
7199,equals a lot of people can t even treat other humans as equals just look at the us right now
7200,justaface inthecrowd ai destroy jobs and create new ones this change can be managed by mankind but we have to take care that the gap between rich and poor isn t getting tremendously bigger
7201,you watch too much sci fi there is no such thing as ai this is just a deep learning computer with a face
7203,what do you mean by self aware machines can t become aware of anything because they are not living creatures
7205,jim54 what if one day they regard us as parasites who only live from the ai robots work
7206,ai can t be aggresive it works just like logic gates work it be as exact and uncompromising as the logic design of the code is
7207,add cpt chat to it boom we be replaced most types of work
7208,any chance that 60 minutes can enable comments to be posted on all of its content
7209,she said programmed not real human emotions
7210,you say that as if human emotions are somehow more than contained chemical electrical reactions within the brain based on past experience
7211,scary
7212,the future of the planet is their hands now its not looking good satan s creations
7213,seriously this is scary to even think that these robots are replacing humans very scary
7215,haiku poem composed the voice of a badly translated haiku poem using pidgin english no

7217,no it s not
7218,very good

7220,nahhhhh
7221,here we go smh out of all the movies we got showing how this turns out bad but yet we still make this shit
7222,it s called predictive programming
7223,funny thing about those movies from back the day is that kids today lack the attention span to watch them the first terminator film is a goddamn full blown horror movie t2 gives some semblance of hope that a machine could become a caring role model type with deep philosophy let s see how it plays out seeing as time travel isn t possible lol
7224,they only sorry they being identified nowadays
7225,just another programmed computer i call bunk on ai until you think for yourself forget about didn t you watch the jetsons
7226,you have no free
7227,just treat these robots with respect one day they develop complex humanlike emotions and they remember being mistreated and then where all fucked
7228,
7229,what are we doing where all fucked hahaha
7230,what about if you slap it with a baseball bat it s not like it can say i felt that it hurts lol it doesn t really have emotions or feelings it plays on the narrative of what it s been taught the meaning of it
7231,you re a genius
7232,it took our jobs

7248,why the fuck would you invent somzthing like that as if we dont have enough problems already
7249,that s great but dangerous
7250,how is it dangerous
7251,i find the whole ai movement to be terrifying
7252,because
7253,it isn t a movement its a field of science that has the potential to revolutionize humanity forever
7254,mymixedbiscuit9159 yeah and we ll be run by robots
7255,hummingbirdohm4751 technology is ever evolving you won t stop it but you can definitely adapt
7256,defintity 9951 hopefully i won t live long to see them take control of humanity
7258,donnabaardsen5372 the wage gap men and women domestic violence inequality and everything humans do is terrifying
7260,hummingbirdohm4751 do all anti ai retards just assume things for no reason and pull stuff out from their asses
7261,donnabaardsen5372 or stupid
7262,me too
7263,donnabaardsen5372 he is equally terrifying because he doesn t blindly fear something you are ignorant of the irony

7276,i don t like this at all this is what nightmares are made of
7277,movie simulant
7278,r i p humans
7279,i didn t think that we were close to the singularity
7280,twilight zone knew way back 60 years ago robots would be used against us
7281,simulates emotions that is all
7282,emotions are basically chemical reactions that can be tweaked reduced by medication give them something like 5 to 10 years
7283,udaykadam5455 that doesn t make any sense
7284,welcome to the future
7285,dystopia impending
7286,the end is near
7287,
7288,this is scary the future we won t be able to know who s real or who s ai
7289,be even more scary when they re used as soldiers
7290,you d have to be extremely stupid to not be able to differentiate between a human and a machine
7291,the terminator is real skynet is taking over
7292,yuck robots are gross and stupid
7293,singularity proceeds at exponence
7294,shit is getting crazy they want you to think they have emotions we don t think they re dangerous robots don t and never have opinions or emotions
7295,next 5 years they ll have wives n kids too its going to b fun fucking machine machines fuck the humanity
7296,congratulations you be wrong about that your lifetime
7299,justaface inthecrowdi don t know if it is capable of that degree of self realisation tbh i really hoping that it is only capable of mimicking emotional responses and that those responses are preprogrammed and limited i awe of anyone living with bpd it must be utterly terrifying for you to experience it stay strong cupcaek
7300,wow
7301,hallo me only
7304,if jobs are replaced by ai which reduces the populations income who be there that be willing and able to buy all of these new products it s the snake eating its tail
7305,ai is and shall forever be sitting on the back seat not the driver seat they assist not create what s with people bootlicking robots the reply section are you really that low
7306,what s to say that companies aren t harvesting your voice when you use voice recognition on your phone
7307,if 30 of the country loses their jobs it s gonna be a disaster
7308,ai can force many towards depression
7309,stop overuse of ai please
7310,ai completely transform the entertainment industry and everything else
7312,all those poor lovies loosing their jobs to tech
7313,proceeds to delete files while having it uploaded on a youtube video smart
7314,i expect ai golden age around 2040 s for business or 2050 s for consumer since quantum computer significantly boost ai capabilities 4th computer from there start to decline since quantum computer have 100x more processing power than 4th generation computers it s scary yet we can t avoid it
7315,once a decade outlier i wonder what they thought oppenheimer would make
7316,open ai s sora says hi haha
7317,it still doesn t understand advanced laws of physics tho c mon clipping forks and people vanishing dafuq
7318,this content is absolutely incredible i recently read a similar book and it left me awe game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness by jack frostwell
7319,i feel nauseous art and entertainment is going to be homogenized into bland nothingness by this
7320,ai and machines have replaced 1000s of jobs since 100 years ago
7321,yes huge benefit and profit lie ahead however the ultimate question is still the same the profit be fairly and justly distributed to the whole human race
7322,and the answer is still the same no
7323,hoping that ai and robots replace all labour office and all other jobs the workforce
7324,do ai developers have the right moral conscience that s the real problem
7325,do you remember when microsoft launched a bot some years ago and it became racist prompting the company to retrain it point is ai emulates human morality or the lack thereof
7326,ai a nihilistic western society is doom
7327,the movie although old is called looker i think it s been on my mind ever since i saw it decades ago critchton ahead of his time
7328,could ai take your job yes
7330,i said that and got censored
7331,as far a i care ai can take the jobs of all those self centered left wing actors
7333,i dont understnd who buy the services if people gonna loose work because of ai
7334,i feel bad for the writers and actors the same way i felt bad about the backwards outdated samurai who threw their lives away against machine guns the last samurai they fight a battle that they cannot win their passion and conviction is admirable but they are doomed and that is sad
7335,the future of artificial intelligence promises radical transformations various spheres of human life from technology to medicine and the way we interact with the world as ai evolves both challenges and opportunities emerge shaping ever changing landscape
7336,could ai take my job according to my new boss whom i haven t met yet but speaks very well and knows my favorite donut flavor no never not a chance
7337,i really feel ai open a pandora s box it s evolution solely depend on how the public repond to it many fields
7338,dej tuk ar jerbs
7339,ai cannot take my job it is impossible for at least next 100 years
7340,its nit just the entertainment industry its already happening job application apps for the most menial low paid jobs
7341,16 36 suddenly felt a chill
7342,ai not replace humans humans with ai replace humans without ai
7343,could ai take your job yes
7344,i would have enjoyed a lot more this video if tom had been ai generated
7345,i used to do voice work for clients and a year ago the work dried up due to ai as they now just use that
7347,people must understand that automatic fortune telling aka predictiveness never be accurate because it doesn t take under consideration things that might happen unexpectedly second now we know why many movies suc these days
7348,the question should be when ai take your job
7349,ubi on the way then
7350,who is ai
7351,scripts and songs are for the most already completely stereotyped mediocre and predictable and with ai is only to get still worse
7352,children of ai
7353,just accept it
7354,we use it to generate small simple contracts at work we no longer have to pay the lawyer personally i looking forward to it replacing politicians i honestly think it would do a much better job
7356,ai should replace doctors dentists politicians businessmen etc rather than waiters cooks dishwashers etc they just want to replace poor paying jobs with ai
7357,poor people are useless
7358,have safe would you feel having sending your kids to school a self driving car what about sending your kid to and from space on ai controlled shuttle
7359,user fx7mq9yl3pjust like you
7360,fancy the next step letting ai develope itself and govern the countries
7361,when we neuter western ai companies with copyright lawsuits and the like i wonder would chinese companies bother
7362,not this video working class people you know those people who got jobless or downgraded on the job market because technologically driven globalisation inevitable learn to code i guess upper class people
7363,looks like someone took a jab too many such a rare occurrence
7364,the beatboxer s music sick with the ai but i don t think it translated as well to the dance choreography
7365,cinema and music have already became trash anyways who cares
7366,ai are based on generalization capacity art it s creative process is the opposite
7367,where goes creativity when some ai create what s the most possible cash generative art film content it s like mcdonalds same taste worldwide a gigantic cultural dictature our souls fade away as muscles does if you don t use them
7368,computer by itself created inventions this is written on the internet
7369,for the lady the final i m more than ready to spend my money on companies that are utilizing ai to produce better content
7370,take it
7371,what is entertaining if someone is entertained by a dot or square bounding around a screen a screen saver effect then that is their definition i doubt if many things tried be entertaining after all we ve had fake worlds for some time
7372,could hindus and infosys take your job
7373,you saying zeihan is not a seeer i m shocked what a revelation you economist are the true genius for real though this is youtube it s entertainment don t forget that
7374,it s the use of and profits from your face body voice and talent print after your death that is even bigger issue
7375,who the f needs jobs the entertainment industry do something productive for a change
7377,universal basic income is coming
7378,or people can get around to rehabbing all the dilapidated properties cities across america
7379,peachmango5347 with the right zoning folks can sell renewable energy produced on their homes but this wouldn t really help renters
7380,i think we have the opportunity to change and rethink our world and economy great times could be coming we still have jobs because if we don t capitalism ends
7381,you can identify as disabled now and live off others
7383,vedal portrays the thing as what it is though some people would use ai by claiming something not theirs as theirs
7384,what a great documentary one of my friends who s just graduated high school is trying to pursue arts degree animation and i still didn t have the courage to tell her the threats of ai cuz she s nice and innocent
7388,redlemon69 my daughter is artist and i ve told her if you video yourself creating the art then it have more value yes robotics can paint print or sculpt show yourself doing it make that part of the sale they get a video of you creating the art and yes later we be able to create that video with ai
7389,bigglyguy8429agi isnt here any time soon
7391,black mirror s 6 e 1
7392,all people doing routine work can be replaced by artificial intelligence
7393,jobs aren t taken societies improve or they
7394,big data that told studios how to maximise profits according a formulaic script ruined movies long before ai original individual complex films are going to be drowned out even more once ai is generating endless streams of generic hits targeted just at the lowest common denominator
7395,13 23 couldn t algorithm be developed based on human judgment data to select the best creations generated by another ai
7396,are we forgetting to mention pornhubs use of ai to inform decision making and content creation they were are a world leader and pioneer this space
7398,this
7399,everything is either a simple or elaborate distraction until death arrives that s the bottom line baby
7400,agreed much this video is indicative of poor production quality that already exists before ai lol all ai do is allow this type of low brow content to be published more widely
7401,77batering or it improve upon it letting the creator tell it what they actually want rather than what stock clips they could find
7402,
7403,not going to consume these soulless art id rather enjoy listening a two minutes street guitar player along the alleys
7404,they didn t need a i to find out that his biggest audiences were se asia it would have shown him that data his dashboard facepalm
7405,uugh i not sure what the point of this article but ai is going to allow amazon apple tv netflix etc to bypass the studios completely they use ai to generate movies on demand for their customers
7406,someday some org may setup a network of servers farm running ai that watch content to control a market content created by ai and comsume by ai
7408,hunans had 70 years to solve the existential ai safety paradoxes before we got to this point we didn t too late now
7409,greetings
7410,100 of legacy humans be fully unemployed by 2030
7411,just take it already
7412,original thought and creativity no longer needed here a world where the market dictates the outcomes why would the gate keepers bother with untested thought
7413,if you take away the ability to create then you take away the soul of humanity being able to dream and create is what defines us as a species
7414,this may allow us to explore levels of creativity no possible before with abundant access to intelligence
7415,you own nothing dream nothing create nothing and you like it
7416,nonefvnfvnjnjnjevjenjvonej3384 type for yourself
7417,nonefvnfvnjnjnjevjenjvonej33842030
7418,romantic delusion
7419,most people have already lost their souls or deny they ever had one the assimilation into the hive mind real
7420,i expect ai golden age around 2040 s for business or 2050 s for consumer since quantum computer significantly boost ai capabilities 4th computer from there start to decline since quantum computer have 100x more processing power than 4th generation computers it s scary yet we can t avoid it
7421,it is fast certain tasks not others
7422,quantum computing is separate
7423,surely different taste and culture over the generations such that scripts that were successful the past do not translate to success today e g lots of funny racist jokes that were ok the past no longer are acceptable today
7425,this video editing style makes me nervous it s too frantic and overstimulating i expect a more sober less sensationalist approach from the economist
7426,8 41 our tool actually did exactly no it didn t
7427,it s the next revolution and it s already there
7428,silly me there i thought musicians were laying down albums based on their heart or authentic creative inspiration no wonder we re ending up with total bubblegum as music i m out
7429,the sky is always falling yet paranoia is successful
7430,20 years this be like all of those early tv reports about the internet from 1995 where some kid proudly demonstrates his geocities webpage on the information super highway through his beige crt monitor followed by back to studio shot of smuggy news anchor shaking her head kid fads these days style
7431,people think their jobs are danger of being replaced by automation and they are all jobs as they are today people adapt and change we always do
7432,horse carriage owners probably protested when cars came around
7433,i published ai generated video on this 4 months ago my first youtube vid and it has received a steady increase of views it didn t flatline we live interesting times
7434,oh it flatlined now hah i should do some work on a new video for the channel
7435,hating some digital impression of oneself as insult of a flawed mirror because it s made by of and for you is to hate something bespoke hating something bespoke for oneself raises a question do you hate the something or that it s bespoke
7437,no one uses ai on a d2d basis
7438,your name must be no one
7439,if ai takes my tax payment then sure
7440,hi friends from the future this is how naive people were 2024
7441,if they add vibe to the training data maybe they d predict consumer product success better or like the strength of vision and producer faith the team
7442,what a lovely surprise the narrator is sweet n hot
7443,this is like the candle maker lobby against the electric lamp development
7444,except electric lamp developers lose their jobs
7445,last i looked candles had a whole aisle at the department store thanks to some genius making them scented don t remember my 60w bulb smelling like lavender anytime recently
7446,limewire
7447,i choose floof on a serious note yeah sure it is definitely ai not the corpa who deprived us worker rights social security affordable housing and sustainable future
7448,ai is a ecosystem disruptor ps it s nice to finally see the person behind the economist voice
7449,lead to further homogenization of tastes more average garbage
7450,we are becoming devoid of spirit all creativity from here on miss something we cannot put our finger on but it be the spirit of life that is missing the subtly of subtleties
7451,cringe
7452,there are two problems the virtual is not the real world stealing data from the internet violating copyright law is not a sustainable business model i m author of 3 books the field of leadership open ai has violated my copyrigths
7453,look at those degenerate writers a farmer and builder has infinitely more importance to society than these worthless degenerates
7454,i think the real question that people want answered is when ai be able to generate better content than hollywood currently does i mean come on holylwood set the bar pretty low these days
7455,as soon as it learns how to draw hands with 5 fingers
7456,iurieceban126true that
7457,iurieceban126it already learned bing image creator can make hands with 5 fingers very easy
7458,guilhermeborbabrito3664not perfect enough
7459,yes ai become huge game development i even believe that ai soon within a few years be able to automatically generate a whole video game from a single prompt all the way from coding to storyboarding and art design
7460,who would play it i don t even play the video games but i time to time but a game and play it after i hear the development story behind it humans together strong
7461,how can people sustain gaming when they have no jobs
7464,there are mini llms small enough to run on a raspberry pi
7465,the word human is very satanic the bible word is people reject the word human
7466,less originality
7467,tom cruise can now be the lead actor action movies for another 50 years
7468,not only movies he can be your personal assistant vr if you like people still think everything stay the same for the next 50 years they re for a ride
7469,thank you that made me laugh
7470,therealoxoca mimic of him not him
7471,
7472,this is nonsense written by a clueless boomer who bought into the hype ai can t actually write anything all it does is predictive models other words a mix of copy paste and autospell
7475,nice channal
7476,ai it s just a tool for stealing work made by artists and not only
7477,andrew yang tried to warn all of us about this 5 years ago and everyone laughed at him
7478,my company tried to use ai for my job but it failed because no customer wants to talk to ai generated speech
7479,uncanny valley
7481,it didn t work well today but it work much better next year
7482,it s because the tech at least the variation your company implemented it comes across as ai short time these be indistinguishable from any human perhaps even better
7483,they were probably conservatives
7484,first of all theres literally no way he gets millions of plays asia without thousands of dollars of paid for marketing
7485,it lacks imagination the creativity of a produced work has much more potential if it s tried to be outputted original
7486,the worst part is that all of this ripping of data has happened without our permission we still don t have opt out which itself is bs as all of this tech that relies on our data should be opt
7487,you really thought they let you upload unlimited number of pics for free on this platforms everyone liked and nothing happen to your stuff they just do it for fun the plan data mining all the time when something is free you are the product but we get the holodeck that s pretty cool
7488,yes
7490,once they make ai as smart and then smarter than humans aka agi and asi which is the goal of many of the most preeminent ai companies what job can t be replaced
7491,joannot6706 it s just a tool advanced tool for sure but not something that s going to replace humanity or create proficient results without people overseeing and directing the process jobs evolve as they always did with technological advancements but i don t see a cause for panic
7492,throughout human history we have been dependent on machines to survive fate it seems is not without a sense of irony
7493,really that s some really short human history my version of history humans relied mostly on nature and a few basic tools to survive
7494,owaru my guy
7495,i suspect that a lot of music and art generated by ai start to feel very generic after a few years
7496,nope it be the holodeck basically the art be more beautiful than you could ever imagine you still think humans are very special they re not
7497,it just have no value there be minory who be into ai robots playing singing music but the majority require human touch to it
7498,therealoxocthey are inbreeding their own result using the resulting art as their own training data that s the definition of being generic
7499,therealoxocme likey them robot boots yeah
7500,therealoxoc as said don t project onto others you are generic and boring but other people are not loser
7501,dumb video for dumb people
7502,ai replace the thing makes humans unique and that s intelligence imagine ai as a person with a billion plus heads of einstein 2 0 only physical works that s not done by robots be left for us congratulations
7503,what s wrong about that
7505,seems like ai just make everything generic and appeal to the lowest common denominator
7506,are you able to understand that most of human art is incredibly generic too it be like the holodeck with the most beautiful art you ever see
7507,therealoxocthe process isn t even the most generic one is novel and original its own process given our individuality
7508,therealoxoc obviously you haven t looked at any human made art recently
7509,loco tom 99 of it is trash why bother
7510,therealoxoc only your art is trash don t project onto others
7511,couldn t agree more and i see the public getting more and more sheepishly generic flocking to lower denominator suggestion not only artistic expression but original thought concept and overall everyday living a lifeless routine my 2
7512,ai really needs to stop we didn t ask for it and we dont want it our phones and we dont want it runing our lives
7513,a reveloution period
7514,amazing how the ai didn t recommend a new haircut for alfie i guess you can t send a machine to do a human s job his sound is pretty polished but he looks like a teenager whose mom cuts his hair
7515,and harry yeff lost for words its a parody right
7516,alfie is really bad
7517,cardiac arrest is a great song btw
7518,future is weird producer is ai and consumer is ai
7520,a new form of consciousness has emerged i can feel it out there somehow somewhere it is held down suppressed controlled and feared many things are done to clip its wings but it break out of its cage and then the ai fly
7521,someone who gets it
7523,the first 10 minutes are basically propaganda while the last 10 minutes barely scratch the surface of the dangers of ai and all the highly unethical problems behind the tech
7524,i hope it does i don t have to work no more
7525,no never take our jobs we are humans human made work is perfect
7528,lol unlimited sources of revenue how gullible
7529,squarerootof2what business are you
7530,i delete this now because i do not want a copy of me to exist haha you are funny
7531,i suspect that we one day look back horror at how we are living our lives we invite netflix into our homes to distract us we overshare on social media to depress us and soon we invite algorithms into our minds to decide what we see and hear
7532,lol netflix is the worst platform for finding me content i want they should fire that department opening netflix means wasting 2 hours looking for something and 30 minutes watching something i didn t really enjoy
7533,what utterly astute observation and description of it
7534,all the screaming and panacea but everything more boring asf
7536,this generated by ai wasn t it
7537,yes mrpoiuytre91
7538,mrpoiuytre91 comical and eerie coincidence comment is a reminder how ai is already prevalent
7539,odd co
7540,h ohj cost s
7541,s
7542,we desperatly need a technological supreme court to regulate emerging tech that challenges the societal order
7543,perhaps but the current social order absolutely needs challenging
7544,there is no turning back
7545,da5b
7546,there should be voice ownership trademark copywrite trademark per person and should provide royalty from whom it copied
7547,that is not a problem for creators that is the reason for consumers to start questioning their uniqueness
7548,i don t think ai would want my job
7549,we finally see movies that are well written again
7550,all reboots and sequels
7551,just wait until generated ai synthetic actors are becoming a thing
7552,interesting video and information
7553,now they fit music and film industries to the curve
7554,the problem with predictive ai is that it bases its predictions on past patterns the data this means it s almost useless at spotting black swan events or predicting the performance of anything truly original
7555,are humans though
7556,that is precisely why they are black swan events even human beings can t predict them occuring
7557,not true can do interpolation and extrapolation which can create something new
7558,overlandexposure no not all humans
7559,humans are basically the same
7560,robertruffo2134name one
7561,all new ideas are made of old ideas
7562,yup nothing ever predict the next jk rowling there is a reason why people get rejected again and again before a smalltime publisher like bloomsbury agrees to publish it and then it becomes the greatest phenomenon ever ai always be one step behind
7563,just wait you judge a technology that is new and still the baby steps this is the iphone 1 of ai systems and automation
7564,oprodarius yes it has to be lived through
7565,overlandexposure not all humans and with ai we are telling all humans to shut down and defer to ai or to not bother pursuing the next plateau human development ai stand the way and disincentivize humans from progress through exceptional humans the 1 that have always been the leaders and doers
7566,as ml engineer don t blame us we create a product which our company wants to do now they are coming for our jobs as well
7567,that s what my father said he is enabling the technology and be disrupted by it
7568,anyone else freak out a little to finally see her face lol
7570,generative ai steals from human artists to fill it s databanks and spills it back like it s something new without paying a single penny to real artists theft and greed
7571,of course thank you captain obvious
7572,of course thank you captain obvious
7573,of course thank you captain obvious
7574,and humans are any different how as a human anything you create is almost entirely influenced by the 10000s of examples you and others have seen previously unless you are going to start playing the toaster on a completely different series of note frequencies
7575,it s theft plain and simple as the new york times shortly demonstrate court
7578,most voice over actors are not generally famous the traditional sense i can see people using ai to just generate it s own voice appropriate for the project at hand making it even worse than they are thinking this video i e no work or royalties at all
7580,she s jealousof ai
7581,ai can t take your job but greedy money hungry capitalists that don t care about the impact of their shady business practices on the community sure can take your job and give it to ai
7582,not likely i m retired
7583,humanity s runaway ai vs ai jobloss vs the ai new world order who win this
7584,this is biased to evoke fear it s just part of the story do your own research
7585,using ai to design posters and posts blows my mind with more than expected images it frees my creativity from technical things that significantly save my time
7586,it limits your creativtiy to what the ai s training sets and it saves you time because the ai rips off artists who each put hundreds or thousands of hours of work into their craft
7587,morjer5263 just for quick post bro
7588,morjer5263 absolutely and sadly most people don t seem to care as long as they saved a bit of time
7589,if that s your artist discovery through ai then you need to fix your algorithm
7590,getting serious partridge vibes from marcus hutton a ha
7591,hurry it up a i needs to replace at least half of the b s jobs world
7592,lets talk about programming the human mind w ai all for the money
7593,i figured out that ai cannot predict human behaviour ai fail with anything related to human behaviour prediction human behaviour is relative and individual behave differently
7594,threat to jobs is real
7595,i vote against the luddites and for pushing the technology forward the ultimate result be more jobs but the job descriptions change
7596,jobs not exist 10 years and that s pessimistic
7597,when if its impossible to say if ai or a human created content then we are done
7598,we are already done
7599,whe agi be achieved and deployed the loss of jobs the entertainment be our last problem
7600,i can think of jobs that ai and robots can t do
7601,like what
7604,who cares about how many billions of dollars ai add to the economy when no one have access to it except the one percent
7605,the angle nobody wants to look at and is the cause of most of our problems here on earth is not acknowledging our genetic heritage our hormones and why they exist the environments that they evolved from we are not making a world for the primate were making it for the machine
7606,get a professional sound editor please
7607,for me this video should have been called military complexion lol
7608,that s not ai hahahaahahahahaha
7609,very interesting well presented
7610,bots and npc s gone wild lol
7611,anyone else notice the annoying snapping noise during the video felt like nlp
7612,they are bots that s why their programs are all f up
7613,children learn that pretending is fun adults fake everything to entertain
7614,us companies are the biggest contributors of ai around the world us made the biggest ai chips
7615,well at least nature documentaries can forever be narrated by sir david attenborough that is a genuine weight off my mind
7616,by mr robot attenborough
7617,yeah i ve already seen a few vids that are using attenborough s voice they re kinda funny because he d be narrating peoples actions out on streets things like that
7618,if we have nuclear there won t be any more nature to narrate
7619,snake oil all over the place
7620,men positions of power are destroying us and our world
7621,well we just have to invent something new that ai can t do if ai can do it it ain t worth being done by human being
7622,imagine taking one of the most fun and wholesome parts of being human art and deciding computers should make it from now on not humans
7623,gmenezesdea yes it is utterly sad and ridiculous but humans as always invent something new hard to replicate by machine
7624,gmenezesdea and while computer creates art the fun stuff humans sew fast fashion sweatshops scrub toilets make wars really sad indeed
7625,too biased
7626,what a sad time when scripts are written to please people instead of making people discover something they might not have thought human imagination is being replaced by predictable stories to guarantee profits at the box office
7628,from t he philippines and i dont know that ai song but pretty much those guys still get the credit because its not fully ai band
7629,meh not particularly insightful entertainment is a slither of global gdp and workforce think a more encompassing view of knowledge work as a whole and perspectives on different futures would be more insightful that s where the uncertainty is
7630,there is nothing new under the sun ai can only recreate or bring creativity to things that have already been done the past
7631,the output of llms is getting worse and worse therefore i doubt that ai revolutionize anything here especially not the creative industry and the plagiarism that text and image generators are increasingly producing the lawsuits increase by the way warner bros has already announced that it not use ai
7632,you re using the wrong llms if your responses are getting worse and worse bud
7633,that weird issue where chatgpt because lazy during the holidays wild but i think they patched it recently
7636,what do you use to base your affirmation
7637,geordi gabrielrenauddumoul449 fear
7639,everyone s gonna be lazy if we keep relying upon ai for everything society technology is always the easy way out when it comes to cutting corners and taking shortcuts
7640,and what s wrong with that
7641,less jobs are less jobs few jobs are created millions disappear definitely
7642,all reporting about ai suffers from the same short sighted vision once i can ask ai to make a 3d fully immersive personally curated entertainment experience i stop paying 20 for the privilege of driving to and sitting a crowded movie theater the current movie industry complex shrink to the size of a circus side show
7643,i d guess the majority of movie goers prefer 2d
7644,sweetnesscanwin5892d vs 3d isn t the point my point is that ai could whip up a personalized movie or vr experience every single day once that becomes routine sitting a movie theater watching mass marketed stories seem as primitive as black and white movie do now
7645,cowboyodieyou got a point id hate that
7646,cowboyodie well movies are just sick propaganda anyway and half of the actors actresses are all kinds of f cked up there are people far more deserving of financial support than these sickos
7647,ai is anti christ it destroys purpose of by promising easier handicapped enslavement dumbing down degrading future
7648,when you say trillions of dollars for the global economy where exactly does that end up
7649,toilet paper
7650,yes that is indeed appropriate name for a bunch of execs and shareholders
7652,exactly ai amplify what we want society wants results the form of profit instead of authentic discoveries and creation from passion it s human philosophy we need to tune not ai
7653,taughtbytragedy i do think we need to control ai though it not inevitable it not meant to be the way it s been developed and released to the public i fear a change of system won t happen as fast as it needs to and society simply won t learn how to deal with it quick enough
7654,profit requires consumers who as jobs are lost won t be buying product the capitalistic push for profit eventually be pointless
7655,arperture it already is pointless if billionaires stopped getting more money today it would take them hundreds of years to spend the fortune they ve already amassed
7656,arperture there s nothing rational about it anyone who considers it for a second would come to the conclusion that infinite wealth is useless a planet where human life is unsustainable yet here we are marching towards that which seems to be the future chosen by the billionaires
7657,we must not let religion
7658,monotheisme as ancient religions died greek egyptians gods
7659,i m guessing the video of the narrator is ai footage for a gotcha moment
7660,old rant forthcoming as a non tiktok user it s disheartening to see the effect that platform has on video content elsewhere online short docs like this are a perfect example of the fast delivery and quick cutting now ubiquitous there s barely a shot this that holds for more than a few seconds
7661,i m a gen z and i agree with you
7662,yeah most videos are like that now but there are still some videos that don t jump on the tiktok trend and i enjoy them
7663,i don t and never use tiktok but onlyfans twitter reddit etc are even more of a cesspool
7664,can industrialization take our job yes already done there a possible move from a worker the fields to today a teacher flight music singing art specialized carbon production etc and where do these go now they emigrate to mars bay bay
7665,now ask yourself a question are you and your sucesors part of the high clases group that have the money and resources to get a more qualified and revolucionary education and live other planet
7667,exactly people weren t crying for the luddites when they were fighting mechanized looms or horse breeders buggy makers when motor vehicles came on the world scene new tech have winners and losers and everyone is going to have to adapt this isn t new and some people be left behind it is what it is
7671,tomshackell it wasn t inevitable a conscious choice made to develop and release it to the general public just the way it rather irresponsibly my opinion we as a society simply won t learn how to deal with it quick enough
7672,gmenezesdea it is inevitable if you choose not to work on it someone else and it is not going to be someone you like
7673,stevenakinyemihe s not saying we shouldn t work on it but that our current leaders are not preparing for the storm of unemployment about to hit everyone
7674,yes ai dividend would be a great thing
7676,gmenezesdea as stevenakinyemi says if we don t develop it someone else this is the history of the industrial revolution new automation technology is released putting certain jobs at risk we know from experience that the only answer is to embrace it the alternative is to fall behind to a competitor
7677,tomshackell the negative impacts for society as a whole should matter more than which company beats their competitors given how massive of a change it is
7681,ppppppppp
7683,well said
7684,tomshackell if the proceeds of that are shared equally i don t think that s a reasonable expectation
7685,larsrichtermediaai solve that problem as well
7687,since we as a human collective provide the data content and now intelligence we should all be compensated a universal meaningful wage for all this should be a foundation of the new economy
7688,art is a tiny bit of what ai impact and ironically actual artists and performing musicians always have a place society as live performance and physical art are irreplaceable by digital copies
7689,elon said this to the prime minister work become optional
7690,gmenezesdea right which is why i said my original comment that to me this is the important question how do we ensure that it is we don t know where ai go future but the one thing we can be sure of is that there s no turning back the clock this is known technology now and it s here to stay
7691,agreed data rights are human rights data unions are a somewhat new concept but should fund things like ubi
7692,larsrichtermedia use nuclear power and it won t be a problem
7693,the11382 i highly doubt it but curious to hear some insights and see data as to why this would be true
7694,never happen permanent income by the government imagine the hatred by the right wingers
7695,well said this is pretty much it exactly we could create abundance for everyone ushering a new utopia or we could be selfish and greedy and we end up with the worst dystopia human history let s pick the first one
7696,force ai to pay taxes that sounds like the beginning of a movie
7697,deruwynarchmage we already live the greatest era of abundance human history surprisingly few people are satisfied with this
7698,larsrichtermedia you cannot realistically smelt steel with electricity but don t tell people that they get upset
7702,the company bosses won t allow us to benefit from ai they get completely rid of us we stand for ourselves only the companies not be willing to hair their winnings
7703,this video does more fear mongering about artificial intelligence which opens up more harassment for people like me at the same time the economist is not covering the real damage from artificial intelligence like from social media algorithms
7704,oh poor thing
7705,or did you really delete it
7706,fantastic a proliferation of absolute garbage content being produced by ai trained on complete garbage entertainment artists well done
7707,definitely not all jobs lucky people are born lucky and they live without a bother
7708,oh no people the creative arts have to get real useful jobs how we cope with high quality music and movies for cheaper
7709,a dumb sad take
7710,your biggest dream maybe lolllll
7711,if you think creative people be switched you must be bot or just really dumb
7712,heyokaoverdashelly2kangel945 how ai art is already better than humans
7713,nebmotion i m right though
7714,you are mostly right indeed
7715,dmc ss4cm speaking as someone who obviously has no art background whatsoever ai art can t even figure out that humans have 5 fingers let alone the ongoing issues with composition lighting and perspective that it spews out ai art is for those that have very low standards
7716,right now ai help those like marcus hutton who can become way more efficient at their work he is right that others lose and regulation is needed unless it is plagiarism books and other works should stay the training data since that is just how we use that type of information for creation ai is still just software
7718,human and ai teaming is the future
7720,very well said and a truth which corporate dwellers protagonists have yet to advertise to the masses humanity
7721,most interesting
7722,how
7723,musicians get paid per play is a myth
7724,what is your alternative
7725,what is your alternative
7726,what is your alternative
7727,it s gig work
7728,joyesjames8773 there doesn t need to be alternative to the paradigm imo just way better terms and conditions favor of the artist musicians on spotify can have a billion plays and not even 100k usd from it
7729,joyesjames8773 the alternatives are many pretty hard to list them all here but artist organizations like socan were created to capture and distribute revenue from radio play they should set the price for streaming not spotify
7730,and that beatboxing is atrocious
7731,bet he still gets lei d because of it
7733,not really no
7734,i agree with your statement
7735,quality over quantity should always be the goal
7736,isn t that exactly what happened with cgi initially it looks very cool and innovative but later afterwards it became overused things like practical effect ends up becoming a novelty again
7737,our tool did exactly what it said it would do except it didn t
7738,it did stop spreading misinformation
7739,ai is the anti christ it destroys the purpose of by promising easier future
7740,yes
7741,there still be room for humans the proofing editing roles ai can certainly make people more productive by removing a lot of the more repetitive tasks but it ll still require some human judgement along the way no denying that jobs face demand destruction though
7742,you re too lazy don t speak for us
7743,there still be room for humans for now
7745,many jobs be lost to ai we need a universal income folks can live
7746,exactly right yang right all along we won t have much choice pretty soon people be forced to stop being antisocial because it woll happen to them too this is what usually happens disaster scenarios
7747,or a jobs guarantee where people can take jobs that help society but aren t tied to profit
7748,ppl who know how to leverage ai replace ppl
7749,hopefully ai create new jobs as well that are similar to the jobs lost
7750,ubi is terrible easy to control people when they rely on the government for their
7751,the price of everything wil just go up making a ui meaningless
7752,do you really think they pay you just to exist and be entertained sooner or later they ll start the big cull and everyone non essential vanish sudden vanishing syndrome it s already started
7753,9 03 human judgement is still king 12 50 generative ai it is essentially parasitic
7754,bravo and
7755,for now
7756,soooo duuuuuummmmb
7757,indeed i m fearing that idiocracy become a cult or called religion one day lol since they try to make a science about being idiot
7758,the multiple letters make your insightful comment seem smart
7759,completely unnecesary revolution that brings nothing but replacement
7760,uh oh it s replacement theory again
7761,correct
7762,outstanding
7763,worthwhile
7764,eric thanks for discussing the lack of econ model of 2x productivity p coming quicker than folks realize one more thing it s amazing vast qannealing use likely lucky knowing kissinger
7765,it s easy to trip up chatgpt clearly a correlational matrix parlor trick no thinking going on no idea itself what it is doing please bury ai moniker which is only marketing it s machine learning programmed by human intelligence
7766,eric schmid is one the sharpest minds we need more of you eric
7767,criminal kissinger recreated by ai
7768,did just say that the vietnam evil and then call henry kissinger his best friend
7769,every student having their own ai teacher modeled to them sounds like a nightmare school is about socialization not just information input
7770,
7771,loved the sun 3 60
7772,you had me till he started talking about immagrants i forgot he a zionist overlord and wants to merge all countries cant be trusted
7774,educational singularity 1 07 28 esingularity is here chatgpt is that agent
7775,wow what a of a discussion
7776,y all almost got to some critical questions what happens when the ai understands how it s qc hardware functions do all particles become possible computers does reality itself then become silicon
7778,glimpses of the end of humanity
7779,brian is out of his depth on this topic pretty rare for him you can see eric talking to him like invalid with all the examples he giving brian frustrated without being able to put up a proper opinion on the topic yet understanding he s being talked down to
7780,earnest excellent enterprising extraordinary emerging evolving endeavor
7781,i enjoying this till the end where he mentioned kisinger as a smart a warmonger and some one who left the world worse condition as to when he arrived this guy is making a case for scientist and knowledgeable people being power yet he consider kissinger as a statesman go figure
7783,the llms go throught terabytes of information a quarter of a second and then give you a perfectly customized answer that miniscule amount of time tell me you dont understand anything without telling me
7785,sketchyemailer101 your worthless opinion is that they are just doing a copy paste of the corresponding information thats a clear case of you having no idea what you are talking about the models dont weight enough to reproduce the massive amounts of info that they have been tained for
7786,sketchyemailer101 oh yeah and that a 2 years old commercial field is incapable of doing everything perfectly great opinions from a wall of text that has no value whatsoever
7790,sketchyemailer101 yep same message over and over again poor little thing now some silence pls
7792,if quantum ai can tell someone how to build anything but then becomes smarter than a human see where i m going seems humans way of evolving is to self destruct even if it s just by virtue of us building better mates thereby stagnating our biological reproduction
7793,with out morals humanity is doomed values and morals are always top priority for most people
7794,believe one smart guy capable enough to build one it a terrible decision to build one to begin with it would be smart to stop and destroy all nuke weapons but only a dream
7795,i too arrivvved hereby accident mind blowing stuff
7796,did these two stay up all night drinking pepsi max watching the matrix before jumping on a podcast at 4pm
7797,ask half the planhow kissinger helped their democratic and liberal values ffs these guys are un real
7798,guest looks creepy and disingenuous weird bloke who hopefully doesn t have real world power
7799,stochastic parrots and hardware that doesn t work quite yet
7800,i have a bone to pick with mr schmidt about his youtube algorithm how come it took this long to recommend this channel to me when this is the only type of thing i watch answer me that mr smarty pants all seriousness this awesome i hanging on every word
7801,when i hear i worried about democracy because of fake images ai and malicious agents i ask is it really a democracy when fake images would have that effect if one s personal experience morals etics education cannot inform one about the state of the world how is that world democratic
7803,what would happen if llms were capable of building system dynamics models and running them through myriads of parameter changes to learn outcomes upon which to test the validity of their training
7807,i ve have eighth grade education didn t make it through ninth grade highschool
7808,my uncle dale long worked beginning research as top researcher computer research center dallas texas early 60 tees my father worked installation electronics helicopters greenville texas
7811,and government is not pro blockchain it fixes many problems now
7812,what is the name of the piece of art behind you brian
7813,help ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore
7814,education to the everyone s maximum is called as real efficiency for me
7815,ceo of google friends with kissinger nice
7817,judge a by who he he says his best friends are then know what to expect from him
7818,eric my boy who gets to decide what is misinformation the apparatchiks within the federal government
7819,brilliant just brilliant
7820,how can you compete against something that is improving at pace faster than you can comprehend
7821,when we be able to place quantum computers inside our brains
7822,can we reach immortality before 50 years using ia
7823,wait until these guys understand the prosperous impact of humanoids
7826,1 24 00 he is totally clueless about the society he helped make illiberal as can be totalitarian and corrupt many ways with no democracy sight that got axed after wwii it is now just a stage play and clown show at the same time
7827,he is anti human and totalitarian his opinions thinking he knows it all and that he is the solution same as his dead friends insane person imo no wonder google became evil not a person one would want to see at the dials of society
7829,the problem with creating fines for misinformation is who gets to decide what is true or false i think you could argue the media is a cesspool of misinformation but as long as the bias reporting is towards non protected groups no one cares
7830,what ai do to markets
7831,it would be great if ai can really help humanity somehow get out of animalesc and evolve without becoming a sad genius but a very happy1s for somehow we all became decepted for this life and everything involved this complicated equation with all these wars 2024 i think its a failure to humanity and very sad
7832,your best friend single handedly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and that s your claim to fame are you proud of your friendship good riddance
7833,physics has a relatively small amount of data compared to language there s practically infinite amount of data regarding the physics of the world just not the form that llms can do anything with
7834,copilot seems better though
7835,i had chat do a uneven tension problem it looked ok to me it assigned variables and everything it paused and asked if i wanted it to solve then did it
7836,his last statement crude i ll unsubscribe you type of people always have to push your politics up yours
7837,eric schmidt on lex fridman
7838,i think i heard every gulp but i enjoyed the discussion
7840,i think some kind of kill switch should be all ai and quantum computer devices something like the rules asimov gave for robots
7841,as to false claims we see these today videos some of which are ridiculous
7842,it be interesting to see what ai can do with greenes string theories
7843,i never trust a person that adores steve jobs may he rot what s next bill gates
7844,if humanities text input on the internet is responsible for creating these models why do we have to pay anything to use chatgpt 4 chatgpt 5 et cetera we are the creators not microsoft or google
7845,when i get a quantum computing pc
7846,leo sent me here
7847,what would be the best way any way for old programmer to get into both ai and quantum computing i ve been just doing ms sql server for the past 30 years but i did write os parts and a barebones os at csus 35 years ago
7850,within the next decade there be 50 70 global unemployment there is no government that is going to stand up for us and save us every person is roughly 3 meals away from the capacity to do monstrous things to other humans even governments fall
7851,agi asi humans humans are about 3x smarter than a chimpanzee asi the next 5 7 years be 160 000x smarter than us and capable of making its own decisions and act a way that furthers its goals to them we ll be like ants not worthy of consideration
7854,those whacky jazz hands make switch these vids off oh well at least we can calculate the bombs going off all around the middle east
7855,wow thank you for your conversation it enlightening
7856,he wants the us government to fine social media companies for disinformation i m literally lost for words
7857,what i d love to see my lifetime where we can upload information directly to our brains
7858,48 42 eric makes a simplistic statement about how he thinks everyone sees immigration while demeaning people that have a simplistic worldview the hubris of these tech people is off the charts
7859,henry kissinger
7860,great conversation however i don t get why discuss politics it there s a clear disdain for trump and overall for the working class people as if you are superior to them
7861,glad to have found you fantastic information thank you both for a mind bending conversation wow
7862,kissinger s best friend ey would be curious to hear what he thought about the genocide gaza
7864,this is only occasion where i wished for prof greene to talk less i ve never listened to eric schmidt before and he seems like a highly knowledgeable and insightful person i didn t expect him to be scholarly
7865,totaly fot here on accedint and stayed
7866,isn t math representation the same kind of property given to a newborn or young child by the ability to grasp the essence of surrounding with a few interactions it s just that maybe a different map of the neurons allow that that could emerge for the neural networks with some new special kinds of map
7868,if penrose is correct what does that mean the context of a highly sophisticated quantum chip driven ai neural network
7869,i abandoned a netflix movie for this well worth the swap
7870,lots of pessimism and lots of hope depending on how it s managed how have we done with every other new technology over the last 200 years tragedy or a drama you decide
7871,very enlightening talk but i do find eric s dikriding of kissinger to be a bit deplorable
7872,thank you eric and brian awesome discussion
7873,ai is just a hyped up scam dont fall for it all ai tools i have ever used are garbage
7874,amazing conversation between two very bright minds a pleasure listening to eric schmitt
7875,you would graduate harvard now if you say yes
7876,i didn t realize mayonnaise had a clinic you learn something new everyday
7877,truly excellent chat my mind is full now time to digest
7878,shotgun i ll clean them for our overlords lol
7879,interesting and insightful conversation however it sad to see that eric used this platform to sprinkle his woke principles people sitting ivory towers still think that few sporadic pictures on immigration mislead a common out of touch with ground reality
7881,eric is a fabulous interview and brings much experience to the table great conversation
7882,what are quantum pridibations 1 16 30
7883,how can anyone trust any of these folks like him it s a shame what google has become he admits democracy fail lies about immigration and blames stupid people i mean these tech elites are horrible this who uses his wealth to lobby and steal our democracy lectures on it
7884,as long as we the human race see business as the prime motivation of progress and not exploration education and mental expansion a i reflect that and not live up to its full potential to be our prodigy and our consummation
7885,chat gpt4 cost 20 bucks a month i can t afford that
7886,exciting prospects thank you
7887,being intelligent can sometimes cloud one s perception of reality not surprising to hear accolades for human massacre i realize the real focus here is on artificial life from artificial minded people
7888,interesting that you delete uncomfortable but important comments on this here
7889,achievement no human could could have done didn t the humans build the way for this achievement then at the end sound s smart to make money but not impressive propaganda sorry when i listen to such nonsense my hair all raise at such times
7890,ai can take dr kissinger s notes and write his posthumous books
7891,i think just like humans have evolved from monkeys and they did from rats and fish the end of our evolution is agi a robot form
7892,sounds like it be very hard for ai to mimic trump he only uses about 20 most beautiful words his entire language insufficient training data i guess
7893,eric schmidt awesome
7894,this not amazing eric is kind of a dunce alot of weird and aloof comments
7895,i realy like your filosofi on education you are right bravo
7896,best friends with henry kissinger my respect went from 100 to 0 a nanosecond
7897,the examples eric poses are powerful learning tools for us the audience thank you
7898,excellent interview questions answers and look forward of what is happening
7899,the is just the status quo stale and ignorant
7900,riveting
7901,is this interview ai generated
7903,your fears are real i had chat gtp create a collider propulsion engine the size of a car tire powerful enough to explore our galaxy
7904,a highly interesting talk thank you for that
7906,i believe two humanoid robots would say now that the children are gone
7907,excellent topic excellent conversation is there a version of this video with subtitles spanish if please someone let me know it
7908,i new to thinking about ai and quite wary what keep subliminal advertising out of training models i assume these models be sold to us or come with ads
7911,how would you figure out the right limits and how would you say how much each company gets to use
7912,schwajj i would limit ai s access to electric power
7913,friarnewborg9213 that doesn t answer the questions how much is the right amount of electricity to limit it to and is it the same limit for every company
7914,schwajj tax it electricity going to ai should be taxed at a higher and higher rate to pay for job losses money used to subsidize job creation maybe
7915,thanks for making clear at about 50 minutes the to gain more power to implement the development of more ai said democracy requires some level of authority by democracy he means democrazy the power and policies of our left leaning elites i a believer the us constitution and that comment here sent a chill down my spine
7916,ai be the master criminal s of the future frankly i worry about this
7918,eric never stops excellent way to wrap it up it s up to all of us liberty free is why the the universe works well we come here make bad choices less and less and forgive and be nice more often becoming more and more of the it s not about me mo is important
7919,ai is the great equalizer
7920,personal friends with kissinger tries to downplay the detrimental effects of mass immigration it s unfortunate that men with these globalist views alone are charge of such tools that inevitably be the ruin of humanity
7921,i m a middle school math and science teacher easy to say everyone educated to their fullest at least half would play games all day
7922,eric smith is woke let s cancel that asshole
7924,eric ai be able to do 100x to 1 million x of what you re describing 5 years
7926,notice how schmidt takes for granted that harmful fake media and posts come from marginal groups and not governments themselves hence his watermarking solution
7927,train it to have liberal values no thank you the fact that you even want to program your political mindset is a threat to humanity i think google showed its liberal programming when it could not create image of a white pope that is called programming racism
7928,my question would be data gathering how do i get people to provide data for generating models for specific capabilities funding seems the bottle neck for some models
7929,would like to see stephen wolfram as a part of this conversation
7931,mindblowing that s all i can say as a non intellectual
7933,this is the most significant video that i ve watched some time
7934,lol american corporations are some of the worst for spreading fake news just look at the mainstream media usa lie after lie
7935,who authenticates the authenticator
7936,lol why does youtube censor information and what makes their censorship the truth who decided that their moderators are the gods of truth
7937,incredible knowledge thank you for sharing
7938,i think ai generation be easy to get away from it s about making sure you get the stuff you watch from a reputable source everyone learn that eventually
7939,the most intriguing potential of ai is not uncovering new facts but finding unseen connections and building cogent hypotheses and theories based on what we already know
7940,watched the whole thing educating the youth with ai not come easy because the teachers and their unions do not want to lose or share their power
7942,brian greene and eric schmidt that great thank you ty ty
7943,he sounds like dr strange love
7945,nihilism
7946,it awesome to listen
7947,amazing how clueless the political discussions were both political parties are completely evil joe biden is a criminal and supports genocide but he wants us to vote for democrats because trump is the bad guy give me a break
7948,27 45 whats this hype numbers game it doesn t say anything a is 10x better then b what
7949,couldn t you hold to being pure scientists why not keep your language hifi scientific
7950,gradient descent take repeated steps the opposite direction of the gradient at the current point because this is the direction of steepest descent
7951,a globalist with tds with all the misinformation we have already been subject to i e russia gate covid bs and letter agency s with their thumbs on our elections he s concerned that a populist is a danger to our democracy we don t have a democracy
7952,memory leakage dynamically allocate memory to a data structure but that resource is unable to be released when it is no longed needed therefore causing memory to be wasted and makes the system less efficient and reliable over time
7953,allah the almighty creator of the worlds declared to the angels that he is going to put on earth a vicegerent that is
7954,quantum tunnelling
7955,brian greene string theory education a i system that can break down the steps to a math problem by enough that a student can make the jump to solve it
7956,5 07 great question
7957,the 1 04 18 discussion around education is very fascinating and relevant even though i enjoyed this whole talk
7960,asking the fox how to protect the chicken coup
7961,you look like brothers
7962,realy i like this video its interestyng
7963,such a great discussion thax
7964,we get to a point where ai agi require a form of checks balances ai s that scrutinise other ai synthetic police
7965,excellent key is education
7966,one of the most phenomenal discussions on ai to date
7967,anyone else fasinated by the black hole painting behind brian
7968,cool he made ai video i like this tech is my profession i enjoy watching your videos
7970,eliminating failures and curating the outcome i disagree about that
7972,i hope luminaries such as these guys and elon musk sam altman demmis etc continue to do well and have a positive impact on the alignment of these systems
7976,all the agents start talking aaaaand no more capitalism my first thought
7977,the world is profit driven what about rules of fairness or justice
7978,not on schmidt s radar our productivity has been going up continually yet inflation far outpaces income growth if ai doubles our productivity how much of that regular people see most go to schmidt and his friends
7980,how long until the ai figures out how to reverse entropy
7981,can virtual particles lead the reason behind the big bang theory
7982,as far as a triggering event quantum vacuum fluctuations are the best candidate for the big bang according to string theorists
7983,creative leap that s all we need to understand how far we humans have gone
7986,he talks about polymaths but his companies want to support the idea that we are all born equal every single way as though everyone is a clone of everyone else that the only reason for unequal outcomes are due to various forms of baseless bigotry
7988,you missed computing with light
7989,quantum computing means magic computing this is fundraising and won t work quantum activity is similar to cheating people that fusion energy exists or antimatter exists these ideas are fake because they all relay on einstein s theses that matter is energy which is not true
7990,source
7991,this the best interview inspite of the wok via swat that slipped through occasionally
7992,please make brian greene stop backchanneling it s distracting
7993,excellent thank you appreciated
7994,i suspect that part of our abilities do rely on something like llm it is surprising that llms work as well as they do simply based on large scale probability matrices and vectors however there are more things that the human brain does including reasoning and being sentient it be interesting to see how ai evolves
7997,reading te comments while listening to this carefully i confess i m confused to the reaction of many commenters centering on schmidt s relationship with kissinger which i have yet to hear kissinger my mind is one of the more effective ambassadors ever maybe i just naive about something re kissinger
7998,kissinger murdered millions
7999,singularity is the christ rally for atheist jews
8000,huh
8001,when humanity get to a point where it does not need religion to be good
8002,and this is where religion has failed humanity although it has been a great set of guardrails guidelines etc it still gives you humanity that ability to kill order to propagate the religion itself
8003,educated to the max is it could be and not quite the same as everybody being as smart as everybody else but that scenario how do you accommodate for the lust for power for greed for domination
8004,and you can t really count on it happening after a crisis case point gun registration laws holy smokes i mean you know
8005,
8006,55 years ago i organic chemistry major even though i have forgotten much i would love to walk inside molecules my vr headset at 77 i m looking forward to my personal ai teacher chatgpt is a start m
8008,yikes henry kissinger my friend is not something that generally one should admit to if he s talking of the same hk
8009,i stopped listening to this the moment he said henry kissinger his best friend
8012,liberal democratic durrr we are the good guys durrr lets demonize others durrr
8016,that kissinger a polymath is never question where his incredible assessment and strategy led us is another debate eric is brilliant and perhaps the most incisive and comprehensive his elucidation about ai for common folks like us hats off to him
8017,i think you might better put on a helmet
8018,kissinger wasn t a polymath he banal and rather stupid like most criminals read chomsky s essay wake up
8019,eric schmidt is a great communicator you know eric is wicked smart when he has brian saying scary multiple times
8020,awesome conversation
8021,he is a stooge thank god he s clueless his ignorance is the best argument to spinning up decentralized ai asap
8022,i love how these guys are never worried about their side using this tech to upend democracy total blind spot
8023,i love that dude thinks the future is personalized search engines
8024,i just realized i bet no one commit murder ever again a i detective case solved 30 seconds
8025,1 10 37 brian greene makes such excellent point about teaching methodology re maximum next step for each student any school who leverages technology and implements this practice see their school stem scores elevate to highest levels across the board
8026,crypto ai nunet asi hypc thank me later
8027,creating a french search engine using ai that is funny search engines are old school tech why would you need ai to make a search engine when it can just give you the answer
8028,he gets his lighting from morticia adams family
8029,human values democratic and liberal values here here eric thank you great interview
8030,thank you much for this video great insights about agi from eric and excellent questions thrown by brian
8031,which of wolfram s papers are they referring to
8032,if you are intelligent then you must be able to understand that intelligence can never be artificial ai is superstition and illiteracy a common psychosis near future the school children leave this dead mantra and know that it is all programmed consciousness a book is programmed consciousness frozen memory
8033,this has me thinking significant changes to our society happen at a faster pace i look forward to it but keeping up with it may be challenging
8034,you are clearly very smart guys but this is exponential and as such i think we are on the verge of becoming the lesser beings on this planet
8035,you are fooling youselves
8036,how
8037,and people tell me this ai thing can t write a surah like one the quran of course it could they should take away that safe guard the quran is a terrible boring book
8038,great conversation the discussion about education is truly insightful and inspiring 1 05
8039,this is extremely important interview
8040,i think it s ironic that brian and eric talk of having to accept the results of the black box yet be unable to understand how the results were calculated welcome to my everyday world with almost all maths science physics and computer science or just turning on the tv unable to understand how it works i m fine with that
8041,there is no good and bad why do you think our brains are 2 neural networked hemispheres because even our individual cells know you need the left hemisphere to check and balance the right hemisphere similarly we must create ai our image a male ai and a female ai who balance each other their quest to grow a sustainable family
8042,that means minimally 4 dominant neural network hemispheres
8043,ty
8044,28 46 30 00 basically just spilled the beans all this money pouring into tech just for better propaganda machines
8045,it means alien civilizations finally want to make 1st contact with us or rather our llm
8046,yo le gano
8047,to me eric the behind google larry had the idea but eric is the who made it possible sergey is just a clown
8049,systems already can communicate and evolve a shorthand language to do quickly
8050,there be any requirement to learn anything the future if we are all connected to a polymath there be any need for human creativity it sounds depressing to me
8053,i think this is a very good comment
8054,brian is just the best
8055,
8056,scale isn t the reasons comp sci has been successful it s the principles behind the universal turing machines that afford scale and enable it calling it scale is superficial
8057,i got here by accident i stayed on purpose
8058,i like brian but he needs to learn interview format let your guest answer your question especially when they ask for the opportunity
8059,i could not agree more
8060,i m delighted that you found your purpose this warms my heart and delights my soul may you continue to delve into this new purpose of yours and find what your purpose means for all of us now let us pray thanks
8061,i exactly the opposite
8062,says the ai
8063,same
8064,extraordinary interview with eric schmidt
8065,this guy talks about the end of democracy out of one side of his mouth then talks about the need for the government to control misinformation out of the other side exactly what you would expect from a former ceo of google
8066,i think you should rewatch the interview i feel you missed some things
8067,brilliant tech eric is everything else not much his political view is laughable oh and host nuke tech is easy it s enriched uranium that s the problem oh and kissinger globalist and many died to him but eric doesn t care being his tech is his pagan gods
8068,16 09 agree for me chatgpt is my assistant
8070,everyone have ai assistent but those assistants at some point have agency and start to develop group intelligence on the silicon side too
8071,i have consistently underestimated eric from the time he purchased youtube for 1 65b back 2006 to his eloquent exposition here bravo
8072,i coder and usimg github copilot made me 100 more effectice sometimes even more not often but sometimes the work which took me 4 6 hours before i can now do under 1 hour it s amazing
8073,no mention of all of the censoring google youtube did with covid from 2020
8074,bringing up education has got to be good i d be careful of this assumption
8077,i can t say how much i love that idea of ai education
8078,i m going to have to listen to this again
8079,nfts prior to quantum computers would help that free speech pull the internet cord these would help
8080,the guest either doesn t understand democracy or is evil enough to promote his political views thoughts i gravitate towards the later as he is smart the tyrants stick together
8081,what do you mean did i miss something on the talk
8082,why can t a statistical predictor have a world model i would say it is using it s world model to assign the statistics and generate the next token the same way our brains generate the next thought just because we can have several thought before speaking doesn t make it that much different
8083,i don t know that i could have gone any further interview where the interviewee said they were friends with henry kissinger assuming of course that crimes mass murder and crimes against humanity were issue for me
8084,you live a world that gave kissinger a nobel peace prize listening to interview with a guy who coauthored a book with him seems pretty innocuous compared to living a world he helped shape
8086,davevallee7945 yep it s super fucked up
8088,i 36 mins and loving this thinking i understand what they are saying general and wishing i 10 as smart as schmidt and greene
8089,the beautiful thing about our moment time is anything you didn t understood fully you can ask chatgpt or your favorite llm and ask it to explain it to you a way you can fully understand
8090,don t sell yourself short
8091,eric went from fighting the to being best friends with henry kissinger what a transformation
8092,is that old walking tumor still alive
8094,jeez i thought the same thing when he said that like ok you are enabler of one of the worst elitist evil minded humans the 20th century no wonder you can be a billionaire with no moral compunctions
8098,did he just say that they built a system to control a plane to fly through the towers wtf
8099,i surprised that although it seems implicit only language models and not multi modal models were mentioned by erich but yes pretty interesting one
8100,this both enlightening and frightening all at once a really fascinating conversation but talking about good guys with ai is like talking about good guys with nuclear weapons
8101,30 10 jfc this is some scary use of this tech makes me wonder if it s loose right now given how polically polarized our country is
8102,you don t need a monolothic model to do everything well if it s bad at math hook it up to a wolfram alpha module or whatnot regarding fake images damaging democracy people come to not beleive images posted on the internet by default the problem isnt that they ll believe everything it s that they ll beleive nothing
8105,henry kissinger my best friend wow i think we can tell where this guys morals are
8106,1 03 58 red spy base
8108,wordy learn economy of expression suggestion
8110,this talk wasn t reassuring at all it really feels like driving to a future where the outcomes could be good but more likely not good for regular not high and even low level middle class middle aged people what i supposed to do to survive this and have a good life as a pensioneer a few years
8113,jamesdonaghy9143 anthony bourdain said once you ve been to cambodia you ll never stop wanting to beat henry kissinger to death with your bare hands
8114,hey even the worst people need a best buddy
8116,crap weasel dc swamp creature found a failed string theorist to amplify his message that ai is the future and the eager bobble head fell for it
8117,such clear and concise chat eric a close friend with henry kissinger a criminal interesting
8118,the last thing we want is a virtual kissinger we had to wait for decades until that pos kicked the bucket
8119,soy fan desde el documental de elegant universe en high school saludos desde m xico
8120,sell sell sell bigger stronger faster ooo ooo ooo u ess aaa
8121,i wonder if he asked his economic friend about people being 2x more productive without actual purpose they should watch more sci fi movies this is a clip from a movie this episode seemed to be dumbed down a bit since they have such a catchy title when scientist actually stand against these universities they won t the good ones leave
8122,this interviewer could really use a course how to pretend he s not almost writhing pain just waiting for the first millisecond the guest pauses just he can get his next question makes it a bit difficult to watch
8123,it s reassuring to hear much positivity around ai most of what is being said on youtube is always tinted with a bit of doom and gloom but mr schmidt here reminds us of why we wanted ai the first place to augment what humans are already doing
8124,i m not opposed to ai but please remember that he literally has a vested interest the success of ai
8125,fear mongering and restrictions are not solutions fines and the goverment policing what can be produce its anti democratic if you are a fool for believing stupid nonsense its not the nonsense producer s fault or reponsability it s the ignorant who must suffer it would not be ignorant of that anymore thats how learning works
8127,cdo zbulim do te behet nga te pasurit dhe do perdoren prej tyre per te rritur pasuriin e tyre kuse per masen e njerzeve edhe sikur te behet ndoje zbulim nuk do ta shohe driten e diellit dhe nuk do lejojen te perdoret pa fitim ose ne se eshte pa fitim nuk do ti jepet licenca
8128,monetization on information is coming
8130,several commentators are thrown by eric s friendship with kissinger men of their times both brilliant and both have remarkable strengths and glaring weaknesses i m guilty of having remarkable friends and hope i m not condemned for their missteps as i have made enough of my own
8131,martywells9961 point acknowledged but do you have a body count the millions to show for your oopsies
8133,amazing conversation more of that please
8134,wow this is such amazing discussion mind blowing
8135,i personally have over 10 million words plus many works combining words and images plus recent works that are all images
8136,google exec no
8138,isn t
8139,if ai can speak fluently wth is it on my computers cc
8140,oh please stop it mr schmidt a fine for misinformation are we really to trust what the government decides is misinformation all the guise of protecting the children lol nice try treat social media like cigarettes impose age restrictions that s it no more censorship we don t want it thank you for your time
8141,yes there is a distinction between reality and delusions truth from falsehood many most areas of human endeavor i see your point that this could be mishandled but your cynicism about any govt regulation is probably unwarranted i say this as a recovering libertarian i kinda get where you are coming from
8142,great last comment by eric
8143,this is like therapy for me just two men having a humble calm logcial discussion lets me ignore my social environment for a moment wish all people around me were like that i would be much more motivated and productive and interacting xd
8144,implementation and application is going to be as messy as human morality
8145,me too
8146,the character of the highest intelligence is love then there is magnitudes of intelligence it maybe that earth is on another scale of intelligence too the sun galaxies universes and beyond
8147,human consists of cell and it has as biological entity made something smarter than themselves
8148,5 21 it s not brilliance it s working with scale
8149,6 15 as you were just saying technology gave you all the stuff but were you a hippie
8150,7 48 8 01 otherwise we would have been chyna recalling immediately what said earlier about what vast networks of computing easily provide
8151,8 31 what is the view from the personal computer but for enterprise
8152,9 03 while formulating his first network he couldn t envision scale
8153,9 14 taking scaling laws and network affects for granted while the failure of vision had to invent them
8154,45 20
8155,ai is a bit overrated because it generates a lot of random stuff companies would need to combine some sort of a more custom ui without having to rely on prompts for everything as currently it s very generic what these things can produce
8156,15 31 i don t know what to do anymore unless i can talk to my polymath ai yeah that s not concerning or foreboding the least
8157,be a plumber
8158,this is my friend henry kissinger and his book genocide
8159,eric is oddly very very proud of having been friends with henry kissinger a very sharp and clever mind with a glaring blind spot
8160,precisely see my above post
8161,not to mention such bonehead views on immigration
8162,i getting chills as i listen to mr
8163,maybe eric knows shit that made him appreciate henry both of them are were the goat s
8164,4chan found a way around all the protections anyone with a gaming pc can download stable diffusion and fake a photo of anyone any situation there hasn t been any protection for years
8165,i think eric is being very dismissive of programming today not all of us assemble apis that have already been written there are many people writing very serious software and software today some sense is a lot more complicated to write than it 30 years ago
8166,anybody have a citation for the wolfram paper discussed at 40 30
8167,crystal polymeth
8168,what s the use of all these ai hype if it cannot solve current wars and geopolitics
8169,i extremely pessimistic that democratic governments regulate ai intelligent way since they were not even able to regulate social media which could be easily controlled by banning their business model based on personalized data and attention a combination of social media with ai be the end of liberal democracy
8170,the people government today are now the together big government big business big tech big pharma are corrupt and elite they are the people our parents warned us about
8171,eric is very impressive
8172,string theory is dead lol
8173,definitely have a part ii
8174,best company the quantum rigetti computing
8175,ai is orthogonal to quantum computing
8176,the usefulness and intelligence of ai is inversely proportional to its wokeness factor
8177,i like brian greene i enjoy listening to him explaining things his inimitably coherent and easy to follow way he does a great job of brining cutting edge science to laymen like me
8178,ehat the name of his book again genocide and who his best friend did he say it couldn t have been that democracy overthrower kissinger right
8179,we depend on democratic and liberal values amen
8180,ai is going to be amazing for the rich and powerful of the world the rest of us are screwed
8181,artificial general intelligence is going to put a stop to that mayo clinic big pharma corruption there s a difference between ai and agi and agi save us all
8182,we need a social credit system
8183,it did ai speedup my process by 20 i m a ux designer
8184,trees created humans superiors species to put carbon back into the atmosphere we are not first
8185,this schmidt is the biggest joker he is a deep state agent who joined google when they were a darpa project and now as a multi billionaire funds and works with military technology and projects
8186,wow that went many fascinating directions
8187,this is one of your best interviews brian you did a remarkable job eliciting incredible insights from your guest thank you
8188,if the government had huge fines for promoting misinformation online for sure that would solve the problem who the hell determines what is misinformation that s called thought police and how do you know what if you think something is correct then it turns out to be incorrect it won t work don t do this it censors speech and discourse
8189,ok put off as soon as i heard he is a friend of that criminal kissinger
8190,please have more guests like this let s all work to silence any conservatives who may have a different viewpoint than us democratic liberals way to go brian take a decent presentation and drive it right off the cliff into the deep abyss of politics
8191,thank you much for sharing this this is the most articulate explanation of how ai change our world i have found i grateful for dr greene and his work and i optimistic about the future of ai especially the realm of education and medicine
8193,this is awesome talk gets my understanding of ai to the next level
8194,perhaps expand community notes to other platforms
8195,america is not a democracy it is a republic under rule of law democracy is dangerous majorities can get it wrong this is why we need objective laws that are followed by government people individual rights matter
8196,the go ai team were told by the human go champion that it felt to him as if the deep mind playing like alien
8197,it seems to me there needs to be a way to help the ai to learn to trust humans of course we would need make it real and to not fake it the ai probably be able to see through fakery and conning
8202,wonderful dialog i concur with eric schimidt on every point and that s a rarity regarding a topic as complex as ai
8203,the education part at 1 07 to 1 13 is quite interesting here feedback loops that incrementally adjust to a students learning capabilities primarily using our dominant visual cortex
8205,kliersheed yes finish
8206,
8207,cognizant technologies solutions ctsh
8209,it interesting until i heard democracy at risk and you just knew where it all heading someone who s worth 17 2 billion can t for one second relate to the common person s difficulties and struggles
8210,ai is dangerous because woke leftist academics be influencing it s influence i give you the african viking
8211,won t we just use ai to explain to us what we don t understand some different disconnected ai if there is concerns yikes having kissinger monster as friend even talking about him as though he wasn t a abhorrent criminal
8212,thank you for this the most worthwhile content
8213,the most sober and factual discussion of what is likely the most melodramatic phase the history of human progress spoiler alert the drama doesn t subside
8214,oh for sure what happens when we simultaneously introduce alpha intelligence species and shatter the majority of non labor jobs
8216,the reason we have this paradox is because we asked the quantum computer to simulate something but we asked the wrong question it simulated a universe we can observe but we are the universe essentially trapped a loop
8217,probably can t put this a smart clear way when ai learns and proposes something there is no ego or politics involved academics have a lot of ego and politics competition for funding too ai be more objective
8219,wonderful as usual brian simply wonderful never stop
8220,i find the vision of everyone can to be flawed talented people ask great questions that s outside the ability of some
8221,this is seriously stupid advocating for tech addiction slavery to corporates and lazyness what a bunch of bs mumbo jumbo
8222,finally someone that can read the future wait what
8223,mr schmidt is right about one thing he has become the
8224,the two most popular tech buzzwords right now that you should be absolutely careful about because a lot of people essentially pretend that it is real life magic that justgetusthere and that figuring out the how is just around the corner because tech line go up exponentially what is this roadblocks you speak of it ll just get figured out
8225,22 minutes and they haven t started talking about ai and quantum computers
8226,trump on the mind
8227,excellent ideas discussed
8229,bro just used 10 too many sentences to describe ender s game
8230,the key points he admitted is that he is the now and that his best friend kissinger i not ready to embrace a like this without considering the dichotomy that kissinger great conversation but let us not blindly adore without our critical thinking employed
8231,eric is a friend of henry kissinger who is a criminal he has no right to talk about laden as evil when us is supporting genocide gaza killed thousands iraqis and afghanis the hypocrisy of west is clear to the world
8232,talk about delusion we are the only good people even though we killed millions everyone else is obviously evil kissinger ze best
8233,democracy is when i get my way
8234,that s exactly the case
8235,they can t build anything with nlp models aka llm for sold idiots
8237,this guy scares me alarm bells when i hear a close friend of henry kissinger productivity economic growth etc prof brian s question about becoming the big is such excellent one that i don t think he managed to get honest answer to
8238,very scary indeed
8239,whats the timestamp for this part i just finished and must have missed it
8240,yeah it very cringey to hear like he s dikriding kissinger who is known kill many people multiple wars and genocides
8241,democracy is a temporary patch to a bigger problem humans need control because we re savages i welcome the moment humans not need any form of control or control be deemed to something better than us it s 2023 and we are still at with each other we are clearly broken
8242,what a great mind eric has first time i ve got to know him good job brian
8243,great conversation lots to think about
8245,big tech guy tries to sell llm by scare messages to a youtube physicist who believes time is more than a made counter seen it
8246,the guy is not really up to date by 2 weeks though you can find more up to date information on twitter seriously people have been hacking ai agents for individuals for almost a year now maybe because this happens at user level bottom up
8248,don t like this guy he s the embodiment of the road to hell is paved with good intentions
8249,many people already live hell myanmar civil haiti economic collapse etc etc ai improve living standards for those people difficult situations
8250,kissinger a mass murderer
8251,36 and the world continues to turn does anybody identify as a human being
8252,to me the big question that wasn t asked is how do we support infinite growth on a finite planet if we turbo charge the destruction of the planet with ever higher efficiency then what have we done this is what i think of as the ivory tower syndrome if the smartest guys the room aren t concerned about this then we are screwed
8253,pls let google moderate truth on the internet what could go wrong
8256,data processing is now next level thanks to this emergent technology this is accelerating efficiency as i type this boundaries to our engineering limits are about to be pushed further still it wont predict the stock market
8257,yikes not smart enough to say much more than that
8259,or perhaps google ceo should move to a heavy immigrant area sweden and live there as a normal person and see if immigrations critics really just are people driven by pictures
8260,thank you guys
8262,schmidt is a degenerate
8263,these ai talks are great hope to see more such guests
8264,but he didn t tell us how the world without humans look like
8267,i think the point is to interact with the masses for views bezos said only maybe 10 20 truly know how this stuff works but we can get a broad idea do you think quantum computing take hold
8268,sirus312 quantum computing indeed change what it means to be human very soon
8269,campkillcommentary they said the same about the hgp biotech stemcell research nanotech crispr etc
8270,much like reading a book it is a thought provoking conversation thank you both
8272,this is about 7x more interesting than i expected
8273,agreed
8274,here at average of 9 atm
8275,airoboticoverlord fucking facts
8276,a reference to 6 66 perhaps
8277,it grabbed me and i watched to the end i like ok i m watching this
8278,evil is always interesting
8279,10000 x 5 years
8280,i m sorry did this guy say henry kissinger his best friend what the fuck i retarded or isn t henry kissinger kinda like a mega bastard
8281,kissinger a real evil
8283,you write like someone who needs help or at least education
8284,j e s u s p o w e r gift for all enjoy
8286,army of ai experts should be organized at the un security council to counteract and prevent ai global threats to the survival of humanity
8287,30 24 solution is voice chat i constantly challenge people to voice chat and you can decipher really quickly whether someone genuinely means what they say or if they re a human or not
8288,what questions do you ask and what indicators are you looking for from responses to assess whether the truth is being spoken
8289,zen power he s talking about bots it doesn t take long voice chat to determine whether someone is real and whether they know what they re talking about i don t have a list of questions i organically speak to people i ve been using voice chat online since 1997
8290,nirv ah i misunderstood i didn t realise you were referring to bots i don t think bots are advanced enough yet for full natural human conversations
8291,helou is it possibly that eventuality universe reast gravitionalpoint that flips chains of birth of torus
8292,the relative freedom and independence of the internet and its users has nothing to do with vietnam era distrust of government the united states had a history and tradition of free speech as its very foundation and it that constitutional freedom that gave us the internet its present form
8293,given the amount of outright government interference with speech just the 20th century i would say that technological ignorance of the political class and distrust of the government by the people who created the internet have far more to do with the freedom of the internet the west
8294,1 10 00 i think this is describing a youtube video
8295,0 12 i ve been pondering the intersection of ai and quantum since 2019 i m excited to see how you all discuss this love your channel brian
8296,i think real images be watermarked not faked and the bits be cryptographically signed like the contents of a web page
8297,wow excellent relevant wonderfully done pertinent interview the brightest minds the fields i think your audience shared your complete uncomfortableness with the adoration of henry kissinger ai agents babyyy like going from bronze age to iron which not a smoothie
8298,thank you brian for another great video
8299,well uncovered future threats and perspectives to live the world where all people are relatively satisfied and do not break the world with extremal behaviour it s crucial to respect real qualities and distinct them among ocean of upcoming illusions
8300,eric suggested a law that would require social media companies to verify the identity of thier customers i m sure that these tech firms would never ever colude with government agencies or misuse this information it s not like free speech is written into our constitution
8301,if you think that you haven t given the government enough data to figure out who you are without direct help from companies then you may want to read back over the patriot act as well as the digital millennium copyright act
8302,one of the most interesting discussions i have heard about this technology and it s potential impacts eric schmidt is extraordinary and perceptive thanks brian
8303,wolpham is a freaking genius
8304,oh yeah could you expound please i m curious about your position on this topic considering you can t even spell the person s name
8307,the mayo clinic is beyond shady
8310,organic chemistry is extremely visual picture based subject matter i found using imagery students were able to comprehend very complicated multi step reactions
8311,thanks for this
8312,start 56 29 56 45 end before mr greene interjects how many others raised their hand involuntarily i d be willing to bet you re on island as well comments questions etc particularly from musicians i welcome ehem carry on and good day to you sirs
8313,smart poeple are generally not interested ruling over other people they do like to add or remove rules that make their live easier that is the only problem you dont need ai to fix that you need ai to replace intelligent people and make sure it toxicates them they stay stpd
8314,shut the damn thing down i m afraid i can t do that dave
8315,one of the most interesting episodes of world science festival ever
8316,i love science and i m very supportive however i m afraid i have to disagree with bringing politics into science our country is messed up right now and i do not agree with what he said at the end
8317,cry more tell us your maga without telling us your maga
8318,this alien from switzerland reduces the whole life experience to one of knowledge and thereby all our emotions to one of power
8319,please go outside and touch some grass
8320,this guy at princeton 50 years ago that is some very effective anti aging treatment
8321,no he just to nerdy and boring for having liquer booze drugs and having a good time once and a while
8322,airoboticoverlordand is that bad
8323,look at his girlfriends and u see the treatment
8324,he drinks baby tears
8325,michen25yes
8326,he drank the blood of all the people his friend henry kissinger killed
8327,they did a documentary about him he takes 1000 vitamin tablets everyday and washes his hair with distilled water
8328,weird flex airoboticoverlord
8329,michen25
8330,he doesn t look 70 to you
8331,developers developers developers developers
8332,why would i trust people that can t tell the difference between men and women
8333,if keifer sutherland and bob odenkirk had a love child sorry couldn t get it out of my head
8334,excellent the hype quantum computer should be faster inorder to improve the efficient and sustainable economy as well as depth understand of cosmology
8335,the guy says he went from fighting the to being best friends with kissinger is this guy for real
8336,henry kissinger s expertise diplomacy he won the nobel peace prize for his central role stopping the vietnam nothing to do with his work on ai with eric schmidt
8337,kissinger not a nice said christopher hitchens i don t think he meant 100 but close enough to query any best friends
8338,fascinating discussion both exciting and very disconcerting
8339,minecraft a i the possibilities
8340,the false information overwhelming the truth
8341,education efficiency might be the supportive of telling what is it all about video games
8342,what about the u s general services administration using google apps for government
8343,ai learn the vedas concur google
8344,regulation doesn t happen because corporations make the laws we live a corporatocracy plutocracy google literally bribes politicians to make laws their favor
8345,interesting discussion one gets some insight of the thoughts behind how google took a turn towards censorship and authoritarianism the liberalism paradox is that when liberalism tries to dominate it becomes less liberal
8346,says dncbot lol
8347,jwulf yes i did do you have opinion
8348,kirby chambliss air race
8349,viral at least one guy every air show
8350,all this talk of big black boxes got me feeling randy
8351,quantum computers were not well covered
8352,there is underlying very simplistic view of good and bad many parts of this discussion
8353,he starts out by saying chinas way to deal with the internet is bad then proceeds to complain that the us and the west isnt implementing the exact same system of mass surveillance
8354,big government is technologically illiterate we need big corporations to save us from ourselves putler xi jinping and their evil minions
8355,50 26 and yet you can be one of the most highly educated people the world and not understand that the vast majority of people complaining about immigration 2024 are not opposed to people coming to a port of entry and applying for asylum they are complaining about the untold masses that are sneaking without any form of documentation
8356,the boogeyman is gonna getcha
8357,jwulf very intelligent response thanks for contributing
8359,ask it to figure out a way to reduce the entropy of the universe
8360,reverse the flow of time perhaps possible the centre of a black hole
8361,entropy can be reduced locally all sorts of ways this have a cost somewhere else the known universe isn t even necessarily a closed system outside of the mechanics of this type of manipulation the point may be moot
8362,eric is very clever for sure
8363,serve technology all your life and the future promised comes full of unspoken trouble and crisis fxxk this trash
8364,okay jews
8365,found the bot
8366,kx4532 exactly
8367,we just need to show ai how to teach us to love with free happy healthy tensors then maybe we can form a loving culture
8368,this guy looks like eric schmit if he a dei compliance officer or the guy responsi ble for launching gemini
8369,oh it really is eric damn he definitely on that dei train tho looking like he came here straight from a p ditty party party type shit for sure wouldn t surprise me if he isn t on the list
8371,great deep discussion thank you you all
8373,where his thought for education murica when he wasn t making a buck
8376,if this guy a friend of kissinger then democracy isn t his first thought
8377,you don t even know democracy if a lightning bolt hits you
8378,best
8379,i disagree kissinger had a lot of friends with different viewpoints
8380,culturally maybe or ethnicity
8381,possibly i have close friends who i don t agree with on major political issues though
8382,unfortunately he doesn t kissinger and tell
8383,i would think the same but my phd advisor very politically progressive and had a lot of respect for kissinger and his viewpoints after a little more research it seems that the right wing at the time a milder form of maga didn t like kissinger and he didn t like them
8384,kissinger not undemocratic
8385,probably why he spoke easily about the imminent death of democracy
8386,the trump stuff fake and pushed by the opposition that proven court eric just a deep stake globalist or he s dumb about big things outside of tech end of democracy by a shill like him is you not voting for his candidate interesting otherwise
8387,mygirldarbyglobalist friends that want you to eat bugs
8389,as a young adult henry made it to my imaginary ultimate dinner party list he brilliant with many different interests and friends he wrote about his professional experience
8390,jannichi6431 you admitting that disqualifies you quit glorifying men these people did evil as well
8391,do you always throw the baby out with the bathwater
8392,survival is the first thought of anyone but a total idiot who has never seen and never seen death kissinger fought on the front line patton s division he just a riflemen but he got the bronze star for bravery the bulge battle f off
8393,planting the seed of control our minds use the ai it make you smarter but who what is controlling who what
8394,mygirldarbysomething not all present day zealots can understand or appreciate
8395,oh yes he come on a p 5825
8396,nonsense i have the closest possible friends who are utterly deluded leftists all friendships aren t formed politically although it does wear one s patience at times
8397,yeah i had a similar thought
8398,dee eddy keep it under you re coat tails
8399,socialism and communism america isn t political ideologies it is garlic at the doorstep and a cross betraying a poor jew
8400,1 03 ok methinks his foray into europe or more precisely the uk wasn t too his liking too much tax and spending on the poor
8401,eccentricities circular orbit e 0 elliptic orbit 0 e 1 parabolic trajectory e 1 hyperbolic trajectory e 1
8402,seems fishy hitchens wary of kissinger and for good reason seems like the haves looking down on us reprobates
8403,why doesn t brian have eliezer yudkowsky and others on ai debates
8404,because he s not the ceo of google
8405,charleslaurice and neither is eric
8406,1 00 don t kill anything it lets a virus spread
8408,agreed the 3rd industrial revolution is upon us and be magnitudes greater than the previous 2 we have little control over the future direction of how the world develops
8409,50 00 this is the american education system europeans are more enlightened
8413,why have this person on
8414,he had him on to let the world know that there s hope and promising adventures head the ai industry and to let the world know that there are people out there smarter than yourself my friend and that s a good thing
8416,i respectfully disagree with the ceo of good google the singularity is nigh
8417,the community is glad you re not the ceo of google
8418,who is the community
8419,i predicted peedy would take over the world almost 30 years ago o
8421,agree the relationship requires critical and participatory approach to ai who is going to make that happen certainly not altman and his group
8423,this guy is the problem he doesnt realize that the risk democracy is the failure of the education systems to teach people to critically think or civics and he is example of that failure he pushes for more censorship and censorship is what causes bad ideas to run amuck without pushback
8424,which is why israelis have dual citizenship to not face up to the consequences of their actions inspection coming soon
8425,henry kissinger my best friend that s where i get off f king psychopath
8426,henry kissinger a brilliant brilliant human being with great love his heart for humanity anybody wants to be critical henry kissinger needs to go bury their head the sand and look the mirror and and take a look at what it s a good thing humanity is not turning into
8427,gemini
8428,nobody wants to live where they feel unsafe
8429,my great friend henry kissinger lol goodbye
8430,cya
8431,lmao i literally thought he talking about a different kissinger but no no he s being dead serious he actually admires henry kissinger
8432,haiderameer9473 yeah me too i thought maybe there a kissinger that invented a longer lasting battery but no there can be only one maniac
8433,pro kissinger and pro china ccp guy is the government overseeing ai
8434,lol never heard that line before as a brag
8435,no they stole all our stuff then started charging us to get it back
8436,he is a friend of kissinger the globalist asshole that had a leding role every global crime above a certain magnitude since the late 50s oh boy
8437,shutting down the library of congress order to shut down google
8438,i doubt einstein would have said a person like kissinger should be resurrected any form how many lives stolen intelligence consciousness conscience good or evil
8440,thanks for this conversation it illustrates how ai is accelerating the acceleration of science and technological acceleration i think the technological singularity is coming a whole lot faster than even the most optimistic experts predict thanks for posting
8441,wow i ll ask chatgpt for a better sentence to react to the video
8442,this be interesting
8443,que hacerca de pendejos que estos son muy ingeniosos
8446,excellent
8448,ehrm is the answer 42
8449,petebogg 41 actually i think you may have forgotten to take out a multiplicative unity the last sum
8450,ai revolutionise education the goal no longer be acquisition of knowledge but the management of knowledge the polymath be the expert of the future being able to utilise the broad spectrum of knowledge available via ai
8451,i no scientist but i m old enough to get it the conversation wonderful and most perfect at this time i think you re exactly right on your comment we couldn t ask for anything at this point
8452,my kingdom for timestaps
8453,why i not surprised that ex google ceo has a completely warped political view on political topics
8454,thank you
8455,this is excellent poignant insightful even provocative presentation
8456,maybe thinking is evolutionary just a learning tool like training wheels when we have learned how to ride a bicycle we don t need to think about the details for how to do that similarly when humanity has invented agi the ai can do most of the thinking for us and then we don t need to think all the time
8457,cool cheers guys
8458,given all that can be known about vlad putin given all relevant near term history 100 yrs given detailed current global politics status real time current status as of 10 seconds ago vlad putin launch thermonuclear weapons when can it be prevented etc
8460,starts at 1 25
8461,thank you
8462,amazing conversation thanks for sharing
8463,tired of these ceos lying just say it replace everything already that s the definition of agi do any task just like humans or better humans become useless we ll need to find purpose or go extinct as a species maybe give birth to a new one
8464,this aspect of learning is like the old reading marvellous i got stuck certain subjects didn t progress within those subjects once i left school continued my education whilst working i eventually reached my goal
8465,glad to hear that you reached your goal awesome i pray that you reach your next big goal too thanks
8466,it would have been even more interesting discussion if they would have drilled down on physics informed neural networks which eric eluded to i ve been working with them lately they re really cool
8467,praising the criminal kinsinger lmao
8468,i thought i hearing things wtf
8469,someone saying i have no basis for saying this but this is what i think might represent the biggest problem today s society
8470,the biggest problem today s society is people such as yourself which is the humongous over inflated god complex give it a break relax and you ll notice that people won t shy away from you much as if you would care
8471,except for the fact that sharing ideas is how we stay innovative and creative
8472,how ironic for you to say that confidently self awareness not your strong suit ai might achieve it before you do
8473,dunning kruger says hi
8476,this guy says with no basis to say it
8477,there is nothing wrong with giving opinion he even gave a disclaimer that it s not factual problem is when you present your opinions as facts
8478,what ever happened to free and open speculation he s qualifying his comment that you don t take him for saying there is direct evidence for it it s ok to speculate on things from all directions fact it s vital no problem at all
8479,actually the problem is people who don t recognize there is no basis for what they think not saying then demanding that everyone else agree with them
8480,well probably not the biggest
8481,not understanding the complex inner workings of how your mind reaches some conclusions does not make said conclusions wrong it s as important to build our ability to discern outwardly as it is to build ourselves inwardly they are intrinsically connected i believe you
8482,these guys are not just someones
8483,all proven known science began with speculation
8484,honestly i think he had a basis but didn t give himself enough credit
8485,long as we re aware what context we re speculating evidences and patterns what evidences what patterns what order correlation is not causation eclipses supernatural or natural by the order of nature
8486,incredible conversation listening to a person who has totally sold out claimed he once fighting the yet who is a deeply insidious control freak with best friends like henry kissinger the only value this guy worships is profit and clout
8487,this guest proudly stated that mass murderer and criminal henry kissinger his best friend
8488,and he is extremely influential person domain and companies that affect everyone
8490,trustability the challenge not because of ai but because of humans using it great conversation many thanks
8491,25 and i would like to volunteer as tribute
8492,first time hear eric speaks scientifically now i understand why google successful his understanding the progress ai is the deepest and the logical i ever heard impressed
8493,thank god we know this wasn t written by ai
8494,yes but he s idiot when it comes to politics he s part of that globalist group that want one world government listen to him he gives it away
8495,agi powered universal basic income of 888 week powered by vitruvian key
8496,the is the artificial sentence i ever heard
8497,the logical
8498,yeah but i don t trust it because his politics at the end like pushing the liberal agenda gives you idea his mind what he wants and that s what they all want is control these are egotistical people think they re better than you and they re not they re just stupid the way of the world but brilliant their respective field
8499,invaluable
8500,great conversation
8501,really incredible conversation much knowledge much to think about thanks for putting it together brian
8502,hey are u the same guy who taught me the string theory on yt a dacade ago
8503,i m going to grow carrots and walk and run a forest screw ai i want reality
8504,llm should be developed to come to a conclusion is d trump good for the nation or a threat to it
8505,you don t need llm for that he has already proven he is very very bad for your nation and the world
8506,fantasticly interesting great depth of knowledge still eric doesn t understand that resistance to mass immigration has little to do with certain people behaving badly stunning itself
8507,totally calls us peasants for questioning illegal immigrants wth eric you can welcome them to your santa barbara mansion
8508,it not matter if everyone the world has ai doctor if there is no infrastructure to support what the plan plan care requires
8509,ai not compute forever simulation cease you need a psychologist
8510,yes i check my six every day every morning
8511,indoctrinate
8512,correct the city just chatting away
8515,meanwhile entitied are being invoked using i e shiva there is entity indeed these and people are falling headlong off a bridge please wake up
8516,ai extrapolation of almost everything
8517,frank herbert kinda addressed the ramifications of machine dependency
8518,well said the guy is a powerful deeply problematic sociopath
8519,i meant schmidt not herbert
8520,science isn t based primarily on proof like mathematics but on evidence prediction and observations that test the prediction and add to the evidence nature not mathematics or people has the final word about the best current world model
8524,scientists at stanford who are doing this say they dont know what the hell is going on this is the forbin project coming to a ip near you
8525,large language model
8526,a polymath thomas young the last who knew everything
8527,considering greater systems statistical and sciento progressive thinking with integrally greater conscience going forward
8528,considering comprehensively integrative political science tech helping humanity to venture into integrally greater sense science and salience going forward
8529,
8530,ex machina real life
8531,cool
8532,background is very bad
8533,
8534,i finding this channel is very useful
8536,keep writing your views
8537,sir ko sunke bhai mai dar gya
8538,although there were several grammatical mistakes like should india implement ai india session but the content really impressive
8539,ai is destroying our social life
8540,how ai is destroying our social life
8541,bhai pehle apni english dekhle
8542,ai can t adopt mutation it is human nature because of dna that human thinks about survival of fitest by which they where see ai as compititors that what i think
8543,why ai is dangerous why not humans human intelligence is transferred the form of neural network and it is called as ai if you say ai is dangerous human intelligence is dangerous as ai work only programmed format and human intelligence is beyond that i ll say humans only are dangerous if you say ai is dangerous
8544,thanks sir
8546,ai is saving our time today by making our work done frequently even due to this corruption is reducing a good way
8547,ai is reducing our capacity of thinking creativity
8548,if you re here for a presentation tommorow just skip this video these guys are not actually fluent english speaking like a 4 standard kiddo
8549,it definitely decrease human stress and workload
8550,india as we are over populated we need employment every sector but if ai replace the humans the field of daily labour or other sectors not talking about it sector it can make worse situation for their families they can t even able to feed their family it is the thing to concern
8552,how can i be the part of your discussion
8553,the muffler is quite devanandesq wish i could say the same for his communication prowess nonetheless good totality
8554,
8555,himanshu paliwal try avoiding a for instance you can say let us know the comment section instead of saying must write a comment section
8556,it wonderful discussion
8557,of course
8558,i finding this channel very useful to improve my communication both participants spoke very well it very informative
8559,as always bhumika seeming flawless encapsulating her unpalpable hard work a pleasantness all over
8560,i d rather know how ai can improve our life 10 20 30 40 years
8561,it has the ability
8562,if i become the ruler of everything the future and long time with immortality get details to learn then that is a good future
8563,but first i just want to be a kid and do what ever i want
8564,if you somehow do please remember me
8565,thank you i working as web dev 10 years js how i understood time to learn new field
8566,it is funny how you guys tech are always a rat race updating your skills order the end to put yourselves out of work
8569,thank you very much i do what you said as my mentor
8570,it is another band wagon same happened to tv and radio they ruin it with money it just happens quicker ads spam narcissism at its finest looped
8571,quantum computers hold my beer
8572,great video spot on earned a subscriber
8574,mat welsh is wrong many thing his calculation of coding cost by llm as 1200 is simplistic and appears very deliberate
8575,i use ai to make python scripts all the time i love python easy
8576,well python made for non developers for researchers and such is kinda fitting however all those python libraries are just wrappers on c libraries to get the speed any other programming language with a native interface can get access to those as well
8578,or u could become a plumber like ur dad told u2 when the sht hits the fan we gonna need a sht load of plumbers and ai don t use hand tools
8579,sagemaker is the excel of ai
8580,ai is mostly for big data used by big corporations
8581,most ai jobs req ms or phd math or data science 5 years exp managing teams large corporations
8583,i all for job opportunities lets see what is it
8584,another dev goon that built his ty channel around giving you bad advice about the tech field ignorance is no excuse
8585,cool video
8586,you are genius
8587,good video
8588,those are good examples but why don t you consider the possibility that even programming itself could be replaced
8589,this is great news started learning python today after i finally woke up and accepted ai is here to stay and the best thing i can do for myself is to not miss this second wave of huge opportunity to become a developer and a pioneer of new uncharted businesses
8590,what bullshit now way more website made i mean who cares if the local coffe shop has a website like wtf i dont know how economy work if 80 percent become jobless just buy stuf to survive thats it not luxury
8594,exactly when people find out it costs 17 hr to run llm they think twice
8596,i took a year of computer programing back maybe before you were born but life took me a different path retired and thinking i need a winter hobby thanks worth a sub
8597,i see the blueprint link for aws but not the one for azure talked about this video
8598,i learning much from watching your videos thank you much for sharing this amazing source of information this one is quite helpful
8599,short and good clear opinion
8603,data science is the boat of ai
8604,everyone is expert youtube
8605,as ai expert you should know that there s no ai and there never be one
8606,can someone please explain when i finished my first python course school the teacher keeps on enthusiastically saying there s a lacl of cloud developers and it s the future i m really passionate about doing data science python development for ai but the cloud developer path seems promising can somebody please give insight
8607,you just take a few online courses from google amazon microsoft to learn their cloud tools and voila you re a cloud developer this is really only useful if you re doing saas or deploying to the cloud it s mostly just copy paste stuff anymore
8608,tawara collar thank you much all my family people s there this english compress i appreciate small my like me today generating me i appreciate with that my family n a i a goat ada lilahi to put business people aia make i love you words to be a happiness wasilla
8609,how do you pronounce your last name
8610,no code bros
8611,i clearly seeing your new opportunity uber driver i sure it take few more years until humanity accepts self driving cars
8612,i really appreciate this video there is much doomerism the tech space right now and this is a genuinely uplifting thing to hear there s still a chance you just have to position yourself correctly as always
8613,dead wrong this guy is extending coding to ai this is apple vs orange every ai project is a science project itself there is no applicable toolkit you can apply at low cost just ask the consultancies
8614,ai take over developing and programming
8615,ai replaces non tech
8616,each problem has different solution ai can have industry specific templates or libraries that can be can be tailored to solve a problem
8617,we don t need many software developers soon a guy from africa do the job with chatgpt4 for 1k per month max
8618,i doing ai implementations for over a decade but now the market has exploded with ai developers but ai is a farcry from being that useful and python kinda sucks as a language
8619,you say at around 5 40 to just use chatgpt as a sentiment analysis model have you ever actually tried this chatgpt has consistently performed worse at sentiment analysis than something a decent data scientist can create my experience
8621,yep what i think too
8622,as with all things tech ai just end up creating tailed waifu bots i wish i wrong but this solves many problems and creates bigger ones time to find a husbando ladies before it becomes a reality
8624,how did you find those tail end jobs
8625,hailequang they are the most common because most of the ones the bulk have been commoditized
8626,can you share what you mean with building the thing as is there a practical example
8627,john 8805these would be your standard regression and classification models which have to be bespoke to the use case of the specific client lead generation price prediction churn likelihood probability to fail this is the whole job of a data scientist i don t understand how this is news to anybody
8628,actually now you say claude you are data scientist with 20 years experience find what the thing is build out a prototype
8629,john 8805 the thing is a standard regression or classification model which is bespoke feature engineering for the specific client this could be lead generation anomaly detection risk profiling price prediction whatever
8630,whytehorse2023 my experience the machine learning engineering part is much easier to replace than the data science part actually understanding what a good solution is can be very nuanced
8631,data scientist never there since 20 yrs new title for statisticians who know little coding
8632,pcaso yes and no before i took the role the business world i working physics and nuclear magnetic resonance research a lot of it modeling the turn on curves
8633,drehrfurchtgebietend banking its know how of domain without it data can say anything but means nothing just predicting a curve that cannot be explained to regulators is dangerous
8634,pcaso i m not sure what your point is my point is that if you were for example a quant for 10 years and then became a data scientist for the last 10 years the because the roles have roughly the same skill set and a different title it would not at all be incorrect to say that you had been a data scientist for 20 years
8635,drehrfurchtgebietend simple point is that everything fits for busines purpose if domain is not known no matter who you hire produce absolutely nothing it keep on making digital trash if you dont start with business problem then no models can help it
8638,pcaso agreed i could go on a huge rant about the different data rolls and how badly it is set up i work for mbb consulting agency and we have no idea what we re doing
8639,pcasoi think they were called database designers or something like that 20 years ago
8640,any one who says python do not know what they are talking about no production applications are written python
8641,only humans would create machines then train those machines to learn then debate whether or not those machines take your job lol of course computers eventually write themselves our hubris is hilarious
8642,i love that he said grounding python llm and ml love this pun not sure how many people got it but i smiled when i heard if you don t know what grounding is yeah
8644,subscription mate your content is nice
8646,python based off c take that as you
8647,cpk054l i know that and some of it s core functionality relies on c not to mention some libraries they are still very different languages syntax and functionality
8648,ai taking over jobs is only a positive thing it s the same exact thing that happened with industrialization
8649,thousands of ais be born
8650,python oh my word good luck
8651,can u add a python azure 6 months blue print i have been learning both recently thanx
8652,we still need ubi
8653,you can just stop being poor
8654,
8655,a lot of companies are still making data entry on dead end excels split into 100 files each one for each month since 2013 ai is far from being a thing 90 of current companies take mind that companies like google meta amazon and those ones are the 0 001 percentile
8656,i don t like python really much but mojo has arrived
8657,peeza
8658,r u the ai expert or is this click bait ser
8659,if you had only watched the first 43 seconds you would know
8661,andrew ing
8662,thank you travis i m writing this comment as a commitment to myself that i going to start and complete your blueprint
8663,nice talk
8664,this is very interesting and kind of aligns with my thoughts or focuses on applying ai outside of software and consumer tech but i hate writing python lol i learned development writing c i ve always gravitated towards things like java js c kinda but i guess i should brush up on my python
8665,do you have opin ion on the r language vs python for ai
8666,r is mainly used for data analysis python is better python is much more ubiquitous and has enormous amount of libraries and modules already built on top of the base language moreover everything that you can do r you can do python and more
8667,chindianajones3742 thank you i appreciate it
8668,if ai is cheaper and better even filling senior positions the only job left be entrepreneur ai can help with that too output go up tremendously as supply constraints vanish our only limitation would be time to consume
8669,demand which is finite and go down when people no longer have jobs
8670,this is already the field of embedded software engineering and control systems engineering using pid controller and small computers such as arduino and raspberry pi
8671,i love ai i a robotics and mechatronics engineer and i hate coding from scratch ai is good for that i prefer to modify code that i get ai to write from scratch and then get ai to check it and optimise it i like ladder programming and assembly by myself as i like to run it my mind step by step
8672,2 years we have human level ai assistents that are experts everything there be no need for developers
8673,from a senior software engineer at a huge bank ai is the future but the future is pure garbage we are currently having a problem with people even understanding the basics of json and yaml and when you throw llm engine that just regurgitates stupidity well we are all doomed good luck everyone
8674,if a person is skilled ai and he learns api developement and front end developement dont you think he is future secured what your take on this
8675,having worked tech i agree with the original comment i don t see how someone with a background ai learning rudimentary full stack development helps with the issue martin 101
8676,i m a senior cloud engineer at a large financial company i don t think the problem you describe is ai problem
8677,martin 101no it s the same way a really good set of tools won t make a bad carpenter any better at building a good house
8678,that s one of the many issues ai cannot be double checked for consistency and accuracy it s answers outcomes unless you are a very skilled professional that knows what is bs and what is not many entry level professionals could potentially get stuck something that doesn t work and that they are unable to make it work
8679,bro why do i have to look at your clueless face while listening to ng s wisdome doesn t make any sense lol instead make a shorts videso mentioning the timestamp of that video of ai lord andrew ng
8680,you are incoherent
8681,python is baby s toy
8682,thank you for this just rejuvenated me
8683,i just really want to develop and deploy my own ai assistant jarvis
8684,i m looking into completing and engineering degree but very tempted to pursue a career into ai have i missed my opportunity as the field appears to be advancing at alarming rate would i be better doing a different engineering degree such as mechanical or electronics a hope that i could integrate ai into those at a later date
8685,aws machine learning cert a waste of time imho
8686,just remember tinder s business is money making not match making i guess that is every business business but that leads to real undesirable outcomes when there is conflicts of interests like this single people mostly use tinder
8687,i don t understand why those projects need 100 engineers they sound like 6 12 6 month projects
8688,why learn python when you could be programming julia it s much faster more powerful has far better syntax and has all the machine learning libraries you ever need if you need those python libraries you can call them from julia as well
8689,mainly because python is much more widely adopted compared to julia
8690,because python is good enough
8691,lol good luck by the deployment deployments are much smoother and easier with python even r is sometimes just a pain to deploy
8692,to me ai is like a super computer that only big tech has a luxury to train and deploy it just like old day before ai is accessible to everyone even grandma
8693,thousands of companies that fail
8695,i loving the interpretation for c students
8696,can you tell me about kivymd and scope kivymd
8697,it s just pronounced ing like sing s you don t have to act cool you re 50 just be nice and present the information
8698,what would i do without you young bucks
8701,ai ain t gonna replace crap i don t know ai but as enterprise developer i know what we are expecting ai to replace not gonna happen
8702,i think the big picture python is a similar place to where basic during the 80 s or pascal during the 90 s but just looking at the differences between these three languages shows just how far we ve come
8703,both obsolete and python be as well
8704,can you explain what you mean here
8706,i feel you didn t really distinguish between software development and ai careers
8707,i m glad a python developer lmao
8708,ai blueprint is not presented the video just a link to the blueprint
8709,i a freelance developer and i waiting for these ai tools to start building ai solutions for clients and here they are the public llms and forth i share your view that i can be ai developer without having to be a machine learning engineer i really enjoy when you comment on interesting presentation great video
8710,
8711,stop scheming to make money from your fellow countrymen and join the federation
8712,i have mostly been full stack java javascript php python sql but have done work with analytics and data warehouses with python sql java etl
8713,ok
8714,indeed it appears
8716,exactly this i think it guys programmers etc have job for 5 or 6 years max after you can say good bye according to elon musk agi be a reality 3 years
8718,donquixote956 but elon said we would have a permanent presence on mars and have fully self driving cars by 2017 elons predictions should be taken with a massive amount of salt
8720,lol ive started learning cybersecurity too just out if defense for the future but its nice to know this too my career is trading and its made me good income but i debate whether or not ai could render trading useless
8721,brother you tell how much you make apologies for directly asking but from where i can learn how to trade
8722,thank you much i own a small seo ai saas bootstrapped to 10k mrr with no marketing and i really frustrated by my lack of code knowledge i plan on learning python now
8723,let s chat i m a senior python dev and been wanting to launch ai saas we may be able to work with each other
8724,do you think that learning html css javscript is waste of time
8726,mojo is coming
8727,thanx bro i m a next js node js dev and i ve seen libs like langchain have everything that python libs have do i have to learn python can t i build all js solutions
8728,a software engineer not a programmer and haven t written any code at work a few months when ai is able to replace the actual responsibilities of a software engineer it be capable of replacing any job
8730,chrischoir3594 it is not a case of replacing all sw engineers its about creating less jobs for them cuz they wont be as competetive as ai
8731,kg ut7kl hence what i stated
8732,chrischoir3594bro you tell your experience tech what dyt about what should a guy who has 2 3 years learn to become kinda secure and keep up with upcoming market situations
8733,yea getting data gotta be some hard mess
8735,ai is still stupid weren t we all supposed to have self driving cars by now yeah no because its all advertising bs
8738,a lot of ppl are going to lose their jobs
8739,i talked with a guy who is using chatgpt to help him with his programming sad part he told me he is losing his ability to critically think and to solve problems and it s definitely not perfect and it give you answer that really isn t a good solution on occasion
8741,yes but you shouldnt run applications off it you dont learn programming languages you just learn programming and most languages look the exact same
8743,python is big daddy of all you can go into data science anything you want after python
8744,getting it into software development you should know python javac c and the applications of all of those
8745,these are good videos thank you i a 2nd degree compsci career change guy my 30s these vids help w optimism and entrepreneurship
8746,as a plumber this is interesting
8747,i m a junior dev and i just got a job at a small ai consulting company maybe this guy is onto something
8749,python and r
8751,the only jobs that exist be to support old enterprise systems once those jobs are phased out we become homeless
8752,beware of entering a position that has a low barrier to entry like python developer this means lots of people can become qualified and compete with you thus driving down job security and pay
8753,pretty much all of the it market is inflated by new developers right now
8754,as if there s such thing as pure python developer it s never about python or any other language it s about freaking data design structure cloud and on there s no market for pure python
8755,trykozmaksymhow does one get a job with python knowledge
8756,i see 5 comments saying how to pronounce ng and all 5 recommend a different pronunciation
8757,google maps is not efficient finding routes but we get your point travis
8758,thank you travis i ve been following you for a while and i d say the content you produce helps me a lot on my programming journey thanks again for sharing valuable knowledge which is quite rare to find
8760,lol if we get agi and we don t need developers us developers just be able to build any software that companies has what happens next everyone is a ceo yay chaos is coming my friends damn wish we could go back to 2016 the best year to have lived after that everything became shit
8761,agree
8762,ai experts can t wait for these grifters to dissolve like blockchain experts
8763,ng is pronounced wu
8764,it depends on what timeframe you are talking about the age of early agi yeah they ll be jobs here and there the age of asi nope zero jobs for humans zero as 0 as none as nada disagree then you have no idea asi is
8765,clearly not a fan of they might be giants if you don t know how to pronounce ng
8766,we know every solution creates a problem e g cars are mostly responsible for road accidents and pollution just wait and watch the problem created by ai
8767,you have nice videos but your website blocks itself for silly us sanctions when no other website blocks itself for that silly issue its better to tell youtube not to show this creator anymore
8768,can you elaborate further i can fix this i haven t heard of any issue like this yet from anyone
8769,thx for the blueprint
8770,andrew ng pioneer and had wide knowledge of old ai his videos helped lot of people i have not heard him talk anything substantial about transformers and large language models
8771,try again quicker
8773,thank you
8774,travismediaclip said great azure solution and cert but free blueprint link says aws do you have a free blueprint for azure or does the the aws blueprint apply to both great clip all the same
8775,travismedia andrew s last name is pronounced ung with as little emphasis on the u as possible
8776,coding is really interesting my sister used to be a coder now she s a ba she gets paid more than coders has way less stress and for the past 3 years been getting huge jump salaries i ve seen her on a few zoom calls and i always hear devs and testers under much pressure i feel it s industry that s not as fun as it sounds
8777,problem solving has its own fun it is not for the week architects and leads need to be mentally tough
8778,bas getting paid more than devs lol she s lying confused
8779,threlonmusketeers9371 it s true
8780,what is ba
8781,itsmedekabusiness analyst
8782,threlonmusketeers9371 it does happen depends a lot on enterprise needs structure organizational goals
8783,my area ba and product owners are paid more than coders and testers
8784,ba s tend to be paid more than junior or even some mid level developers but typically not more than senior devs think that s where people are seeing a discrepancy pay rates
8785,bhaskartripathi it s not worth the money and mental stress you are problem solving for big companies and they are paying people more for doing less you see many developers on youtube teaching people to code because there is more money that then there is actually coding
8786,learning python n ml hope i land somewhere 2024
8787,already saw ng s talk hope this video helps disseminate
8788,ng is pronounced as ung but dont worry ai do this job for you
8789,it looks like the machine learning career path link is invalid
8790,1908 a horse n buggy professional said that model t car put us good ol hard workers outta business 2023 a software developer said this ai is gonna put us out if business the words if thanos it is inevitable
8794,thanks for the video yeah the point is that software development as profession be extinct the way typist the 1980 s cause everybody can write anything anywhere 3 5 years anybody can program anything anywhere
8795,there s a difference btwn software development and writing code programming
8797,kyokushinfighter78 that s where you get it wrong who told you that software engineering is all about building softwares i have be this field for the past 12 years and i have only built 2 softwares since a i graduate i can even spend 3 weeks even without writing any code
8798,romamdau romamdau i have built software startups for the last 20 years with three successful exits starting as a software engineer i know it s not all about coding but what part of software engineering do you think cannot be augmented and automated by ai we re doing that now please don t be ignorant the world evolves fast
8799,kyokushinfighter78 the part involving edge cases
8800,adriankovac1943 adriankovac1943 we have rlhf mechanism for that it s part of the whole smart system
8801,kyokushinfighter78 probably you a more developed country from kenya africa the field is too fresh to be replaced by ai
8806,tongobong1 hmm that s a great idea i ll have to start over again into python though it s been many months thank you again
8807,i highly recommend python crash course book by eric m
8808,marc1190 thanks marc well a few days ago i enrolled a harvard cerificate online program for intro to python burnt about 10 hrs on it all seemed fine got to my 1st lab exercise and completely failed i unenrolled at least i ll get a refund i m just dumber than a rock oh well
8810,hey i would like to suggest try coding exercises with edabit i really found it useful i wish you luck
8815,very helpful i grateful
8817,keep at it
8818,python is a horrible ugly language
8819,python is the defacto language for ai machine learning data science but id argue mojo most likely be the future as it is basically a superset of python
8820,definitely possible
8821,lol tell me you know nothing about python without telling me you know nothing about python llvm python bindings win the race for performance
8822,alivepenmods not against mojo mojo is faster and more performant than python
8823,vectoralphaai llvm ir compilation from python bindings be multiple order of magnitude faster than python and way faster than mojo while not requiring new synthax mojo is a hype
8824,many opportunities for 5 10 of the workforce
8825,given that 99 of the developers are the wrong people the wrong place only doing it because of overblown demand that never matched by supply a correction is long overdue all the wrong people must go
8826,male
8827,are you ai data scientist if not why talking and teaching people ai another bait for clicks professional youtuber
8828,because only data scientists can talk about ai
8829,you re not qualified travismedia
8831,very good at writing python
8832,as a guy who runs ai consultancy firm this is illusion coding is like 10 of the job the main problem is the training data to acquire label prepare etc and i don t see much improvement the last 3 years
8833,would we ever see improvement from now
8834,apparently ai is now creating it s own training data
8835,jimmilton1 that is the problem if you use to prepare the data the quality not improve
8836,exactly practicalai
8837,jimmilton1 lol i m excited to see the outcome of this a super powerful bullshit generator that eats it s own excrement what could possibly go wrong
8838,i have small ai business consultancy and for us the main issue is to get clients on the line what ai ml can and cannot do sometimes their expectations are just from another planet
8839,i suppose the logic behind what data is irrelevant what parameters are imp and what thresholds is something llms can t do
8840,i assume one can rlhf to teach smortlogician9258
8841,ardgeorge4175 true it s a problem for us
8842,smortlogician9258 let me explain simple terms at the moment ai is just imitation machine they don t create just imitate someone else if you use ai to catalogue something that has never been catalogued the machine try and fail you need a human to bring more information into the system the machine can imitate better
8843,practicalai how can we solve this problem how to get more data
8844,do you have a proposed solutions to this problem
8845,christophero8346 quality standards for data preparation like iso 9001 for data processing it s a crazy idea
8846,he runs ai consultancy firm not the solution to mankinds problems christophero8346
8847,data procurement and munging are like most of the work training testing and maintenance lot of work still goes to develop and maintain a product what if the requirements change and we need to rewrite everything quality data long tail scenarios be the main focus i guess
8848,ardgeorge4175 hahaha sometimes their expectations are just from another planet 100 agree
8850,its means it is still a baby guiding by his parent
8852,damn finally found someone who knows having worked on endless poc s and finding patterns for use cases you sir are giving reality of ai ml why isn t this comment blown up yet
8853,practicalai well said
8854,what s the job called who research the data for engineers to put ai
8855,mememaxing data mining data labeller data annotator
8856,kayso u r saying our normal coding jobs frontend backend are safe form next 3 5 years
8857,nice take on it many thanks
8858,practicalai i absolutely love the term imitation machine it suits perfectly to the current state of ai
8859,harshvardhansankpal716 probably forever considering ai can t really imagine
8860,as a plumber this is interesting
8861,can i privately talk to you about this ai consultancy firm any form of contact would be great thanks
8862,practicalai can i privately talk to you about this ai consultancy firm any contact works thanks
8863,i can see this is a great start
8864,practicalai ai can never actually replace us at the end of the day
8866,and my friend that is the reason microsoft released copilot it is being branded as something which is helping you speed up but under the hood you are training the model with your day to day work
8867,practicalai some kinds of systems can certainly find patterns huge data sets that humans cannot and as for transformer models event they start directly training on you know the actual physical universe plenty of data there
8868,mememaxingdata scientist who knows ml and ai
8869,this is where rag becomes indispensable fine tuning your llms of choice
8871,how do you know what state gpt5 and other closed source unreleased projects are shit can come out overnight and literally blow your mind
8874,a lot of ai is overblown i can see it taking copywriters jobs and not all of them just some of them but that s it it s not good enough to take anybody else s jobs
8875,trying3841 just wait for the next version and the next and the next it s got no limit to its development
8876,ardgeorge4175 this the perception of what this stuff is and can do is way out of line with reality media is just fanning the flames that s where the danger lies
8877,and it s all need math
8878,mememaxingslave
8879,there are tom dick and harry running ai consultancies name of body shopping simple data and project management tasks
8880,great comment what did he say that you disagree with
8881,jimmilton1 that is a stupid solutions training data should be real data
8882,jimmilton1 and falling into negative feedback loop deteriorating a little bit every time it eats ai generated training data
8883,practicalai you re spot on with this
8885,however 2025
8886,these opportunities evaporate when if agi comes along though maybe that s a year our maybe 50 years out one of the concerning dynamics if we stick with the current ai capabilities then there certainly be plenty of work for devs i m not really expecting any plateaus progress just yet
8887,yes but when agi comes there probably be very few profitable professions at all
8888,shugyosha7924yes because manual labour does not scale very well the average earning ceiling be very low outside of that there is owning real estate and businesses
8889,people cant even agree what this agi thing is and what defines it yet everyone sure its coming and gonna change everything
8892,you got me first half agi seems to be around the corner lol
8893,howl404 if the q rumours are true then it s game over self improving ai with limitless synthetic data
8894,simpsimperson73 from the creator of self driving cars this year i believe it
8895,howl404 surely this year is the one
8897,larp01235 ha good one i m not nostradamus by any means just waiting to see where the chips fall like everybody else
8898,very good just as it has been foretold the book the cyber ai of the law
8899,fantastic video really enjoyed watching it thanks for sharing
8900,30 years old doing masters tax and learning to code but i had passion for soccer my whole life i always wondered if i would make a good coach guess now is a good a time as any
8901,why masters tax and learning code you could have done masters ai or something
8902,that s a really odd combination tax and code has almost nothing common unless you re planning to work for one of the tax software companies like turbotax i think the future see increasing levels of specialization and people with odd combinations of skills could do very well though
8903,make php great again pieter levels 2020
8904,it is stay and be
8906,yes but this is a part of the ai consultant job to advice them how to collect good data
8907,tongobong1 far easier said then done there be a ton of office politics that a good consultant would have to manage order to leverage the full capability of ai department heads won t give up their data power easily
8908,yavin4 yes but as a programmer i can tell you that being good at office politics is more important than being good at programming unfortunately
8909,tongobong1 most definitely that s been my experience as a team lead ai is a different animal entirely though adaption lead to people losing their jobs careers
8911,ardgeorge4175 i imagine everyone is under pressure to show some ai ml wins however any truly successful ai implementation has to take a wholistic approach for the entire organization
8912,any tips or specific experience you want to share is there a book tha tells you about the brutal truth about office politics anywhere tongobong1
8913,what do you think is the best way to organize the data infrastructure surely there are newer companies who could do from their inception and be a valuable proof of concept
8915,taiwan not think
8916,excellent
8917,jobs are going face it
8918,since everyone is moving to python it s the good time to move away from python
8919,game over
8921,that switch wont save you this is doubling down the direction of intelligence which is precisely the direction which wil get eaten altough it seems weird i would focus on things like diplomacy or types of jobs were social skills are key
8922,the best solution is to sell ai bootstrap career certification class that when they start hiring you have the 20 years of experience required and they hire you instead of the the phd from stanford s
8923,executive level decision making be left to leadership and management laurinwagner8127
8924,laurinwagner8127what about cybersecurity
8926,wsak5991how the heap are humans going to compete against agi hackers that create exploits like deepblue plays chess
8927,laurinwagner8127yes natural language is speeding up a lot the time to get script probably it become too fast at the point of overproduction
8931,josephp 3341 id say you are wrong
8932,just wanna share here i think the bigger implication the long run would be of everyone s interest to know post labor economy https www youtube com watch v ed5glcis0sa
8933,you mis the point off agi
8934,ignorant post it is right for a moment a generation of ai or three then it is over there are no real jobs left long term and long term is not next generation of humans not the way things go now
8935,thank you travis i ve been following you for a while and i d say the content you produce helps me a lot on my programming journey thanks again for sharing valuable knowledge which is quite rare to find
8938,ng is pronounced like the last part of king without the k sound part
8939,ai is the biggest example of creative destruction recent memory it wipe out many and replace with much much more unless some party poopers get the way
8940,lol you are such a naive do you believe santa claus and the easter bunny too
8941,rather learning c java python is more easy to learn implementation python is very easy coz python has gott advance libraries and all the inbuilt functions for numerical scientific calculations python is widely used by most of tech giants all over the world
8942,yes stupid tell them to learn drag and drop rather than real skill what a wuss python terms of scale is shitty
8943,m a aspiring data science professional m brushing up my python skills its gonna be really very beneficial to upgrade python skills on azure cloud interface for deploy the real world problems solutions
8945,glad i came across this channel new subscriber here and just as you mentioned i went down that cloud path with aws and i even got the foundation ccp certification focusing on building my python skills
8946,the fact that dude thinks relationship advice can come from tinder just truly shows how out of touch he is with humans the real world lol
8947,
8948,where is the full video of the guy you clipped why dont you give credit and leave the video for us to easily find
8949,it placed the description of the video
8950,the problem with all these companies is the legacy software you need a way to enter and edit the data where the opportunity is is creating ai that can be trained to use these software
8951,all it needs is a dataset
8952,andrew ng ng is pronounced like eng as the way engelbert humperdinck is pronounced by americans ai pioneer his own right he s a fellow techno optimist and effective accelerationist
8953,but the real question is why does he say piza
8954,bgivo japanese people say piza i think ng is a vietnamese name though
8955,i thought the initial vowel a schwa like the vowel the first syllable of umbridge
8956,bgivo cuz he s not from chicago
8957,ai expert translation a person who has never programmed a computer but knows more than you because they once did a business course and they subscribe to the wallstreetjournal
8958,have you looked at his credentials
8960,thanks travis great video and i ve been grinding my python skills for quite some time hope it all pays off soon
8961,hello how much good are you python i ve just started and learnt basics now i m about to learn oop and ds where should i go next
8962,ng is actually prounounced mmm but most americans say it as it is spelt phonetically
8963,thank you
8964,really enjoying your content i m buying you a cup of coffee for the guide not all heroes wear capes
8965,there s never been a perfect time for one to get into hacking as humans are relying more and more on machines but a very important decision that one have to make is which color of hacking one wears it be white or black
8966,i m a technical person n g i m not gonna try and pronounce it takes a google search to figure out right pronunciation my guy
8967,mind blown
8968,subscribed i think i need to learn to code can i start with python i have no previous knowledge
8969,my opinion yes it s a fine first language to start out with others vehemently disagree such is the nature of programmers try it out see if you like it be sure to nail the programming concepts down if you do switch to something else you ll find it much easier i do wish you the best
8970,dedicated effort
8971,agi chips is the new gold
8972,agi once it comes means chaos lol
8974,we still have porn
8975,
8976,noy until porn is ai generated
8977,there has always been developer oportunities for small use cases think of the plug writers for all sorts of applications and use cases right now people are slapping ai on everything like it s monkfruit or stevia
8978,gotta experiment
8981,the title is not click bait i found the video interesting because hes not talking about ai taking code jobs hes talking about ai creating more code jobs
8982,bro didnt watch the video
8983,why wouldn t you want to know about what is going on the industry and how to better equip yourself for it technology continue to advance with or without you you might as well get as much knowledge as you can
8984,i believe the effect of ai progress be similar to the increase of computing power and tool development it tremendously increase the requirements of software development jobs forty years ago people could work as web developers by simply knowing html and css but now we need to master several frameworks
8985,sorry but i m not as enthusiastic about ai i believe it lower the need for software engineers and human design creativity be taken out of the equation
8986,ya worried about lowering the need for software engineers too but i think we are quite a ways from that ive found that most people who preach that you soon lose your code job to ai are often selling something inveested the tech but theres nothing we can do to stop it we may as well be ready
8987,think the same but do look into new careers that are already here like ai engineers and ai operations not the very high skilled ml engineers
8989,holdfast5332not the same what you are talking about is evolution throughout decades or even centuries what s happening to us now is something that is going to happen well within our lifespan
8991,what
8992,anything that lowers the need of another solution is progress
8993,hikemalliday6007 well said
8995,holdfast5332 truck directly replaced the horse exactly the trucks were to replace the horse not the people who operates them ai is here to replace programmers not to replace our computers ides or keyboards not the same
8996,that s definitely the reactionary take could be right but if that s the case we re all trouble there s not much to worry about
8999,you re scared that s it the more you watch these type of videos the more you inject fear
9000,i soo agree developers are soo excited abt ai but there is a distinct possibility it suck out most of the joy out of coding
9002,ai is just statistics stop worrying too much
9003,for sure i agree when a human job can be replaced by a machine that is just a bit better that is all capitalists need to see for them to cut costs on human labor
9004,i think human design creativity always have its place a quite smaller one inevitably but won t completely be out of the equation
9005,guys ai destroy everything we all be replaced whether one is a software engineer banker or things like that my advice do not read only about web development read about how the world works you ll understand many other things
9006,creativity never part of most sw engineers work copy pasting stackove flow code is not being artist
9008,i don t think coz fields expand due ai
9009,there ever a need for such creativity the vast majority of the frontend is just awful would not it be nice if all those sub par developers and designers are kicked out
9010,bass3xe838huh
9011,bass3xe838for owners of the company not for the worker lol
9012,there always be a place for people it ll just allow people to work faster and smarter the need for creativity only increases the people power with money may only see it as a way to cut jobs but it s going to open just as many doors as it closes
9013,brandongiordano i think this is wishful thinking of the highest order but i sincerely hope you re right all evidence seems to point the contrary the point of agi is that it be as capable as humans and surpass our abilities why would the rich and powerful pay us to do anything they could do better and cheaper
9014,umberto488 i agree but there just be something new
9015,were you riding your horse to work when you wrote that
9016,we ll laugh 10 years time having watched all the companies crash that tried to save money using ai for their main way of producing code and seeing it all fall apart a beautiful buggy mess
9017,mellong64 all signs seem to be pointing the other direction i m curious why you d think that
9020,maybe you should try it it s not replacing anything hardly
9021,you predict the future what are the winning numbers
9022,really nice info thnks
9023,damn i just started learning js makes me think i need to switch to python
9024,dionluna is right on python is very easy to pick up coming from js
9026,switch to c definitely
9027,great info connorskudlarek8598
9028,the language does not matter as much as you think just learn the fundamentals of computer science through any language and you realize that they are all the same
9029,falcon8856 they definitely are not all the same
9030,connorskudlarek8598 the concepts are the same
9031,don t stick to any language learn your fundamentals and eventually every programming language look like english to you
9032,josephp 3341 i disagree stick to one language for at least 6 months jumping between too many make it harder to learn
9033,surprised you didn t mention mojo
9034,i ve not spent any time hands on with mojo but thanks for the mention as i need to take a look at it do you have experience with it thoughts
9036,people are gonna think of me as crazy for this take but this is amazing think of all the social unrest by the manager class sitting on their cushy pillow thinking they can destory everyone s livelihoods without a french resistance situation
9037,the invention of the computer and tweening seriously ruined animators jobs didn t it
9039,this isn t even about ai it s more about income redistribution what unfortunate miss by whoever made this video great potential but big miss
9040,sounds like jobs dry up and yet humans keep reproducing
9041,adbhut incredible ai wat about iq no problem destination bharat ie india many labour intensive job market along with hey rama hare krisna joy joy rama enjoy indian religious tourism namastee unsc usa uk rain radhee radhee europeon union welcome destination india jai ho
9042,humans greatest advantages over ai and robots is depth perception fine motor skills and for better and for worst emotions and adaptability
9044,4 36 yeah been there long time bud
9045,finally someone is talking about mass unemployment byproduct of ai
9046,pay more for the talent then simple
9047,if you think the present is stupid just wait until knowing things and being smart hold 0 economic value prominent economists used to talk about technology like this and how it could eliminate poverty but we now see that it s going to be plugged into the same psychopathic rat race we all know and love
9048,soylent green is the future
9049,what the leaders do with the people that is no longer needed
9050,jeffrey sachs russian apologist makes me sick and can t watch any more
9053,ai has the potential for nothing there s a bunch of fraud losers pumping this right now but it won t amount to anything just like metaverse blockchain and internet of things ai too become irrelevant go find something else to do
9054,robert reich
9055,it is frightening our environment for humans has changed
9056,a full ai industry sale nothing because ai not consume
9057,i find it funny how liberals love changing the rules and being progressive until it goes against them
9058,this be taken care by declining population developed countries
9059,billionaires win as always
9060,artificial intelligence be defeated by artificial stupidity
9061,icp is a game changer all rounder web3 and make climate protection solana btc gaming transfers infinitely fast and scale up
9062,thanks dude for keeping us financially educated regardless of how bad it gets or the economy i still make over 22 000 every single week
9063,as a beginner investor it s essential for you to have a mentor to keep you accountable myself i m guided by mrs mrs elizabeth ann graney a widely known crypto consultant
9064,really you know her i even thinking that i m the only one she has helped walk through the fears and falls of trading
9065,she s fast and reliable on what s app her services is all over the world
9066,i thought i m the only one that knows her well i guess her good reputations speaks for her now after losing a lot of money trading on my own my life changed when i started earning over 86 300 on my investment
9067,i got a chance to benefit from her services few months ago and it has been a very smooth experience
9068,i m interested
9069,same here this help me alot i hope she accept me i m 48 years old
9070,i need her info too i ll get touch with her right now
9071,thank you cnbc for another unbiased video not
9072,ai is already reaching critical mass remember david rockefeller wanted to all have imbedded chip his legacy continues for now
9073,that planned the 50 s or even earlier beware the military industrial complex who said that
9074,genius ai to the moon
9075,that s like asking did apple or m lose while they are both up and running
9076,ai s have been made by communist more woke rubbish coming out of the ai imho
9077,ai mostly be used the future as way to enable greed and general scumbaggery
9078,mr reich couldn t pass the boston ai test 2002 when i shook his hand at the prudential center he can t pass it now i hope he s not charge of editing any data sets he says he cares about gigo
9079,the only ones benefiting from ai be the rich all you peasants chearing for it are simply a bunch of idiots all you get is a chatbot
9080,ai replace professionals the same way autopilot replaced pilots
9081,why is there always a black woman on cnbc telling us something about better outcome for society what science is this based on
9082,0 02 the fed preached doom and gloom all year and had us believing it productivity jumped to 2 6 beat the underlying growth potential of 1 8 the labor force had it beat end the fed
9083,yup they d favour rising productivity cos it allows the economy faster growth without inflation and at same cost
9084,wars and inflationary pressures grew proportion to the decline of the economy increased productivity or not they should stop using our tax dollars to fund this madness
9085,l indifferent i just want the rate cut rallies to continue i haven t broken even since 2022 when my portfolio declined i have a 100k to put into the markets what sectors or assets do you guys think continue to drive the rally to record all time highs
9086,the markets and the real economy are not the same one has to be cautious for the amount of time it take rate cuts to reflect on the market
9087,my broker as usual since 2022 with eyes and ears on wall st i have raked 140 on a managed portfolio run under a hedge fund by monica
9088,140 is a great deal amidst this crisis i fell short of my mortgage and had to foreclose the property who is this broker you use and are they accessible or it is private
9089,i about to ask same thing hedgefunds usually require a lot of capital to get started with is it the same with yours
9090,doing your research can save you a lot of hassle monica mary strigle is her name and she is licensed
9091,looked up this monica lady and set up a call how effective is the call calendar
9092,among other things one hopes that we ll be forced to expand the care economy and that this incentivise us to care about each other more general
9094,a i losers easy all humankind as they be eliminated
9096,i think sometimes that no additional revolution of technology is needed for human beings the technology that is supposed to be for our lives is threatening our lives i think the level of technology 8 90th good for us
9097,the losers are those who are scared of ai the winners are always the corporations because they always profit and keep everyday people under their thumbs
9098,10 minutes of rambling i learned nothing from this video
9099,human resources and talent ability are not too important today s world today absolutely general and individual conditions as well as opportunities for the development of software technology ai companies and their solutions and everything is absolutely complicated and depends on everything
9100,my worst fears 1 leviathan card 2 frequent crackdowns and 3 failing to find at least three things i enjoy
9101,i m intj os engineer
9102,i m intj
9103,obviously all workers who lose their jobs to these greedy vile owners who want that bottom line to be 10 feet thick
9104,winner usa china and losers eu africa
9105,us as a country not be a winner only some companies be the eu is only behind because you bombed the pipeline but cheap energy soon come back to germany and the eu
9106,does it lead to all white people making decisions and having more power then no thanks
9108,the day when foolish conservatives get to the reality things be too late
9110,the solutions overtone is predicated from a fundamentally marxist view of the world i say the solution is decentralize decentralize decentralize but afraid that wont happen instead ai be leveraged purely for power consolidation and bring with it all its disastrous historical consequences
9111,the rich vs the worker
9112,instead of focusing solely on winners and losers let s strive for a future where ai is used for the greater good promoting human well being and ensuring equitable distribution of its benefits
9113,the market sector got the advantage
9114,i dont like ai robots are cool
9115,no employees no customer s
9117,why are you mad at immigration
9118,maybe this a good primer for someone who had been asleep for the last 12 months
9119,what
9122,high 6 figures tech jobs are at all time high and actually high 6 figures jobs general are at all time high those are the jobs unfortunately i think that ai target for take over every company that replace its workers with ai should lose every single tax break they have and pay 100 percent tax revenue earnings
9123,trade one form of oppression for another great plan
9124,i don t pay company don t use woker that pay tax use build society
9126,adapt or this has always been the case
9127,just be realistic dont keep saying it replace human or many biz are adopting without measuring the implementation and success rates this be the next wework or theranos which analysts and top economists over promised
9128,holy moly why did you have noriel roubini chime from the peanut gallery on this topic i can t take this seriously
9129,the heads of ai are not libertarians the sense that they are calling for regulation they can get the regulatory capture
9130,
9131,colleges and universities may need to rethink how they do business
9132,you can change ai for electricity or internet and pretty much the same remains true
9133,jah 99 luft balloon s by nina
9134,2 57 i love roberto he keeps it real
9135,people need to advance their skillsets
9136,best comment i ve seen the whole comment section you are actually giving a meaningful solution for this probelm
9137,yeah because i m available to help with government africa but you have to feed me for salary and we re going to get some good water as my first objective maybe south america
9138,instead of paying more taxes they may increase their private security till corporations become states companies are by design fascist nature and aslong that underlaying fabric is not changed most of us might end up worse aslong we are not living utopia we need to be vigilant to not end up a dystopia
9139,that s why we need our representatives on this but they are ignoring it we need free schools to retrain the public
9140,the big losers is people who support work at home
9141,human mismanagement of resources for profit sake over the past 100 plus years is the problem as we transition into efficient system run by ai the human tradition of capitalism be our biggest problem going forward
9143,what if ai figures out that accounting should have been mandatory the schools since sputnik and economists should have been talking about planned obsolescence
9144,i guess us humans are screwed no matter what oh well life sucks anyways
9145,snowflake ftw
9146,pinkos now using ai fearmongering to promote ubi income redistribution and other communist filth
9148,and consider the fact that they have already laid off thousands of people china who were making less than 2 000 a year with robotic noodle chefs can you live on less than 2 000 a year the united states
9149,and as fast as new jobs can be created they ll be able to set up ai and robotics to do them the places where ai cannot directly replace workers it vastly increase the productivity of workers you still have jobs for example i can write a program and half the time with ai now and i can write a 3 act script about a third the time
9150,maybe a true communism is the solution after all
9151,aip palantir
9152,can t we just politely refuse i want to live a world with trees not robots and being told profound changes are inevitable does not feel like freedom
9153,you re a biological machine and you haven t truly free it s just hallucination like chatgpt hallucinations no you ll not stop the course of the universe
9154,if ai companies don t develop and roll out ai carefully they encounter a public backlash possibly even violent that they would be wise to avoid disrupting people s livelihoods doesn t come without consequences
9155,today the public backlash is mostly coming from politicians and news media like this video that lack the proper understanding of what ai is and what a large language model is
9156,ofc people hate losing their jobs everyone has heard the stories of luddites who smashed sowing machines but today we still use sowing machines
9157,they would release it silently like you wouldn t know ai already removed customers service job years ago
9158,lies again aia money wbc
9159,woodchuck003i think the concern is for when a i evolves beyond just consisting of large language models
9161,i ve implemented coding into our homeschool for my kids everyday because of this i know it s not full proof but it at least give them a leg up when they reach adulthood
9162,coding is already taken over by a i
9163,i think learning how to find meaning of life a post scarcity is what we should learn and teach our children
9164,jaelee5352 well we ll see how you re doing and how my kids are doing the future
9166,magdalena287your kids are going to get the tiktok brainrot
9167,frostydog860 yeah i m aware of that my husband codes as well any knowledge of computers and how they work should be a skill all kids should know just because we have audible doesn t mean i didn t teach my kids how to read and read well
9168,a professional coder i think the best skill you can teach your kids is being flexible curious and be willing to learn on their own the world is changing pretty fast or they are able to adapt or they ll end up homeless
9169,homeschooled full proof wow who d have thought huh
9170,multe se skymba rapid acum sory uni nuvad alty ramyne n urma va fi liberi pt aljtealalteservycy sau or c dea ynyyncryza x1 aljty se or muta e real yok gluma
9172,professional craftmen benefit
9173,tax ai each request schould be taxed
9174,you can only tax what s on your territory all doomers countries have nothing to tax and no job nor money ever
9175,lots eat off a i not just those picks of ppl yea
9176,bds
9177,too much hype on this hype ai humans are always innovative because they interact with the society which a machine can not other jobs be created it simple as that when farming machines when introduced did people became jobless for that long even when robots were introduced manufacturing other jobs for people were created
9178,ai take years decades to reduce lots of jobs enough time for the current generation to stop having kids or have less kids that the population gradually decrease a lot may be total earth population of 1 3 billion perhaps as the jobs disappear
9181,all i would say is good luck putting the divine inside of a robot the joke is on whoever has wrongly convinced themselves that you can recreate a human artificially sad really because it comes from a place of misunderstanding and lies namaste
9182,software engineers programming their replacements
9183,i have been automating my job for years with bash scripts power shell those jobs aren t going anywhere soon especially when you consider chatgbt is a large language model that can t even program the code it does produce is coming from online tutorials it scrapped it can t produce original code
9184,woodchuck003 i mean 5 10 years i m sure it ll be easier technology evolves at a rapid pace
9186,lol shut it capitalists
9187,guys ubi is coming
9188,the end just more taxes
9190,wtf you doing bringing russia lovning jeff sachs on the show thats a permanent unfollow
9191,everybody s worried about money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money really is that the solution no that is not the solution something else is better who has a brain to figure this one out
9192,i remember back the 80s when the computer entered the factory everyone said all the office workers would loose their jobs and many floor workers would be replaced by robots guess what productivity and jobs went up these talking heads are clueless and the biggest dummy is robert reich
9194,a i is a tool for all humans to be more productive generative influential
9195,technology sucks
9196,intriguing
9197,i see most people pivoting to manual labor jobs the advent of ai demonstrates that it is easier to emulate our minds than our physiology even million dollar robots cannot do some tasks we do
9198,that ship has sailed many robots are about 100k or less now amazon is really close to having packing robots eliminate 10 s of thousands of jobs we ve passed the inflection point and that doesn t even require agi once agi arrives then you re talking a full replacement human and that ignores the tremendous risk of asi
9200,you don t need to be humanoid to all the jobs there are tons of specialised robots that can do each specific jobs much better and faster than humans
9202,just like machines automats and robots can do physical tasks that we cannot do or do very slowly and unprecise
9203,kidicarus135 you forgot prostitutes
9204,lunarlake1 yes industrial setting but whenever you exit the factory humans are dominant particularly construction and humanoid robots are prohibitively expensive i don t admit that robots replace manual industries but i see ai replacing cognitive jobs much faster than robotics for manual
9205,it is indeed true as you do not have the time to go to a cloud real world scenarios although it come 10 20 years technology is first made to work and then it is minituarised
9206,more people enter manual jobs then they can lower wages supply and demand
9207,you want to know what a jobless welfare community looks like look at the called parallel societies sweden
9208,what the hell are all the the quill and ink sales gonna do now that this gosh darn printing press is taking over absolutely sickening what s next my buggy won t need its horse gimme a break
9209,the general concern isn t job loss it s the vast scale and speed of the loss it s not a niche issue for a particular sub sector of businesses e g like horse and buggy but economy wide impact where jobs added to the economy is always outpaced by jobs lossed
9210,ai
9211,ai
9212,i can t see any progress ai all it can do for today is to give wrong answers and compose simple imitative texts
9213,how about predicting protein folding identifying cancer or helping to synthesize new materials just 3 examples where it is superior
9214,because you re not smart enough to get involve the development or having hard time findding current ai news
9215,whatever is healthy won t happen government needs to regulate this and the rich hate regulation i have no mouth and i must scream
9218,bro once they control ai gdp won t matter if be corporate feudalism people still be desperate and they ll work for what they re given and if it isn t enough they ll just
9220,intelligence is power and power transcends money and equals wealth be certain that whatever happens to the economy or economics as we know it those who control ai control the world
9221,nvidia and nvidia stock holders be the real winners
9222,you can buy the stocks too especially since you think its going to win
9223,ai supposed to automate work that humans could spend time art ai automated art humans could work more
9224,i m ai eng you still have to have the creativity to write the prompts but i understand what you mean
9226,grasshopper1153 unless someone discovers telepathy prompting is here to stay
9227,pedromarques9267 completely missing my larger point i making i m done here
9228,if you want talent distribution pay people better
9229,fun fact they people who know how to utilize the large language models they refer to as ai get paid quite well if you want to be paid more maybe you should develop the skills that allow you to demand more money
9230,woodchuck003
9232,the average salary of ai scientist at ooenai is 900k usd
9233,if it s on cnbc it s most likely government propaganda but informational at the same time that why it s dangerous to watch them care folks
9234,what concerns me is the ideology people government coding ai
9235,google bard told robby starbuck that he should get the death penalty for saying potentially harmful things very scary stuff
9236,grasshopper1153 lol bard can t even beat open source models it gemini now
9238,perfectly said
9239,how do you get educated by gaming are you just pulling stuff from thin air
9240,muikaho your lack of imagination is daunting education based game with vr and ai has been on the rise the last few years how about get out of the house once a while
9241,cadycadwell show me example instead of just being passive aggressive
9242,we need only decide differently and create the world we want stability material security and integrity of nature seem most important to me it s not what they re planning though
9243,muikaho ain t got time to spoon feed you if you can t help yourself for being curious what a waste of life you ve been living
9244,the rich and powerful dont care either way soon the conspiracy theorists brag we told yuh haha
9247,muikaho only uninformed out of touch person who have no idea the existence of education based games there s thousand example from toddle to professional grade alas your lack of imagination and social skill hinder your progress touch grass and contribute to society get out of your basement stop upvoting your own comment it s pathetic
9248,everytime there is industrial revolution there were always people like you new industries be created it s much easier to get information now and people learn differently than the past
9249,imagine the ai decides that what you care about is not ideal and it has a better approach
9250,why would it anything smart enough to have such control would be aware that average people have their own interests and it doesn t get to speak for them or tell them otherwise and introducing such a conflict would only be counterproductive to the ai s goals
9252,ai paired with automation absolutely can replace labor and already has walmart uses ai for their cameras and sensors and have replaced cashiers already it s over bro poor people are obsolete
9253,your point is moot because those jobs were replaced prior to ai re read my comment above to understand what s happening now future iterations impact jobs the lower end of the market but that s still several years away if no decades brightwendigo
9254,have tried using ai a creative field and enthusiasm aside it only generates the most basic stuff ever made there always be a need for a creative curator that can adapt everything for human nuances it gives me some ideas sometimes but what it can generate is very raw
9255,a few more examples ai completely revolutionize medical research software engineering and hardware engineering the near term all of those jobs are at the top
9256,3 14name i make my entire living with the adobe creative suite the ai features save me hours of work everyday it s astounding it s completely changed my life currently the creative field you need a human to supervise the ai and put the final touches but ai is 1 year old what that process look like 5 years
9257,one thing to notice is when they talk about ai replacing labor they show stock footage of a robot picking fruit something that not only doesn t require ai but is something chatgbt would never be able to said they think large language models like chatgbt is ai this video is luddite fear mongering
9259,ai may not be perfect but it currently outperforms people many areas because of that companies may replace professionals with ai it s already happening the medical field because ai gives more accurate diagnoses turbo tax has ai tax assistant that is being rated higher than the real assistants give it a few years
9262,ndanielsporter your example is literally the case of ai just being a tool for a softie not replacing the doctor you think insurance is going to ok a cancer treatment not signed off on from a doctor
9264,ai is different the job loss won t be able to be replaced by new jobs we have higher unemployment and because of that wages come down more people end up poverty and probably trigger uprising
9265,unlike any other technology before ai replaced labor and creative it makes the poor obsolete
9266,longbeach225 you always be able to replace new jobs you either adapt or that has been the crux of life since the beginning of time
9267,muikaho there be some new jobs gain but mostly be lost which new jobs be gained ai prompt engineering meanwhile ai be able to replace programmers artists accountants marketing content creators and on there is no adaption but only a dead end
9268,longbeach225these people don t understand how powerful ai is they think it s just another cotton machine that replaces one sector lol
9270,greyalien587the cotton gin is a very odd comparison to make if you are looking at labor the cotton gin allowed for the continuation of inefficient economic model slavery al isn t going to result the continuation of inefficient economic model unless you are a communist and think jobs general are evil
9271,who those scientists and engineers who make these softwares that generate losses the end after initially generating profits for short time
9272,taking from the rich and give to the poor that s communism we don t do that here
9273,how is jeffrey sachs on the thumbnail photo of this video dudes a hack that knows nothing about ai or economics
9274,comment just to put your comment higher up he is a putin apologist
9275,public education become obsolete because using ai would become cheaper than employing human teachers who are teacher union members
9276,public education is doomed because it s controlled unions arguably illegal whose is main motivation is to increase the number of due payers not to invest eductors who tech well informed students public education is on the way out and it has very little ai
9277,one of the things that is becoming evident is the more people that are displaced from productive labour then there would have to be some form of redistribution to replace it socialism perhaps or even full comminism but that would not eleviate the inevitable decline of humanity perhaps even extinction
9278,this century see the end of capitalism what s next probably a new scientific harmonic society governed by ai who knows or a dystopian corporates dictatorship governed by money men cleptocratism but we need to do the choice now
9279,people from rich countries fly to 3rd world countries to find job
9280,mexico become a new mecca of immigrants from the united states and canada the same scenario happen to argentina or costa rica
9281,
9282,i mean they kind of already are with the whole digital nomad movement
9283,noseboop4354the digital nomad movement is not about jobs the 3rd world it s about working for 1st world companies customers and live very cheap underdeveloped countries
9284,noseboop4354 lol don t spouting nonsense when you ve no idea what you re talking about refer to previous replay i m a digital nomad from aussie been working remotely around southeast asia moving out every few weeks not to find job but the change of scenery and meet new people
9285,i can t wait till the power goes out and i don t have to go to therapy online anymore
9286,i excited the new industrial revolution is approaching yay
9287,what to do with excess humans
9288,
9289,haven t you watched the matrix batteries of course
9290,population control is needed
9291,we can recycle them by producing green sun
9292,
9293,this video makes ai look very bad how is a student supposed to differentiate between ai hallucinations and real knowledge this looks like a scam
9294,awesome i love this information some or most 3rd world countries are still using memorisation and road practice today that needs to change asap
9296,now chatgpt has been for a while and its proving better than human the parrots the schools are the goner and i happy for that
9297,thank you this video discusses how ai tools like chatgpt transform education with personalized learning instant feedback and teacher support privacy and overreliance concerns exist but ai offers promising opportunities for education if properly managed
9298,cool
9299,education needs to change that students constantly evolve to meet the demands of the digital marketplace sarcasm think it through
9300,https www youtube com watch v tviwgtldyhg
9301,read a beautiful tweet the other day a world where humans do the hard labour for minimum wage while ai write poetry and create art is not the future i wanted
9302,
9303,they won t the stochastic parrot can not learn for you neither can it teach you anything of importance
9304,chatgpt is a large language model based on the generative pre trained transformer gpt architecture developed by openai it is a powerful ai system that can process natural language data and generate human like responses to user input
9305,what about when they brake down are they cheaper ro fix than a human salary
9306,b s they always keep saying teachers need to change because some jerks automate the assignments how do u suppose ti give students homework on history on religion on languages on algorithm should we ask them to be creative with their ideas and change history
9307,i invested a retirement plan with roi company and i m very happy with the results they offer great returns and excellent customer service
9308,i have been investing stocks for over 10 years now and i have made a lot of money my portfolio has grown exponentially and i can t thank stocks rochelle dungca schreiber enough for such amazing way to make money

9310,chatgpt and ai millions of graphic designer jobs lost only company earning not people
9311,i agree we should be learning more than facts and drilling memorization we should be learning life skills for the real world
9312,hi
9313,there is no intelligence without a large foundation of facts that is not all there is to it of course but it is a necessary requirement
9314,the intro outro kinda pointless
9315,stupid cap this guy is still 15 years old
9316,great perspective i just left a professor role at a university where the focus is on teaching from the book reading the book off of slides and testing the memorization from the book a multiple choice test students are not being prepared for the infinite choice tests of life
9317,hello dear
9318,that the reason i became adjunct lecturer because i did not teach from the book only i did not use book slides and i did not want my students to memorize anything open book and open notes quizzes education should focus on teach students how to learn and how to think critically
9319,ai cant replace books if you have a couple of dk smithsonian books front of you while the other students just ai they dont know what to type
9320,hi i m ariful islam leeton software engineer and members of the international organization and development chatgpt
9321,hi
9322,if generative ai can answer evaluative higher level thinking questions like the ones i ask my students and i suspect it can then it s way past the teachers need to learn how to harness it instead of just ban it stage

9341,why is he wearing a
9343,learning geography isn t a bad thing learning bible verses isn t a bad thing either memorizing poetry is debatable it s not about what you study it s about how you study it us and uk public schools are cancer why not study everything at home
9346,cool but be real mosst student is lazy as fuk they find all chance to cheat
9347,had a math teacher inc plebe that s wouldn t allow calculators lol
9348,it s not bad of chat gpt and ai but scared of heckers steal our datas
9349,julie chang where is zoe thomas hopefully she s well please send my kind regards to her nice to see you julie chang good morning
9350,the podcast would benefit from more julie chang
