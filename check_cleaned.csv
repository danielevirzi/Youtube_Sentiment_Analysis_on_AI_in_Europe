0,this video is lacking cutaways to the slides and the volume is too low
1,never send a human to do a machine s job
2,this talk is full of sh i have worked ml for the last 6 years i deep into this stuff llm have no planning and reasoning abilities none zero it just happen that they incurgitated much textual data that it feels like they can reason but they can t they just spit out the most probable words given the input prompt there is no internal mechansim of causation we need another breakthrough to get to agi we are still far from it current llms are super useful but they definitely make a lot of mistakes agents are definitely a good research area but as of today their outputs far from perfect and needs a lot of editing if you don t believe me watch what yann lecun one of the most important figure the domain has to say about it
3,audience all looking at their phones and yawning
4,humans like this are definitely ushering the end of the world ted talks need to change it horizon the same corporate death spiral
5,what leads you to believe that the large percentage of the population world wide that get displaced the job market due to ai are going to participate the technology the speed at which humanity be displaced the work force be unprcedented massive layoffs occur the service industry what leads you to believe that a large enough percentage of this displaced work force adjust that civil unrest society is avoided
6,don t we already converse with customer service chat bots for companies
7,skynet here we come
8,ai agents be our personal sidekicks for real
9,i m ready for my ai agent to take over mundane tasks like deciding which netflix show to binge
10,jk but seriously ai agents sound amazing
11,asking for a friend
12,ai agents help me choose my next tiktok dance challenge
13,no luck yet
14,when do i get my personal jarvis like tony stark
15,asking for a friend
16,again
17,forget human landscape architects designedbyai is the real deal
18,if ai agents can fold my laundry i m all
19,can t wait to have ai agent that knows my coffee order better than i do
20,i hope my future ai agent has a better sense of humor than siri
21,havenly who
22,if the future is full with ai agents which do plan perform create same way as us humans what all of us actually do order to get the benefits these agents provide for a fee of course if a business can be run only with ai agents with 10 times less the cost how this business find customers together with the rest of most other businesses which do the same when 10 time less humans receive salaries and the unemployed part of us not be able to pay for all these services that be happening instant
23,ive wondered who buy these companies products too if this puts most of us out of work
24,super a mirror to the future
25,tony stark like the richest person the world that s a great avatar of who benefit most from ai
26,i think narrow ai be a net positive and generative ai is probably a net negative for humankind
27,i m hard on hearing thank you for the lowest volumed youtube video ever
28,important ideas clearly communicated
29,book me the cheapest flight to london sure 4 stops and 72 hours travel time
30,at this point you have to narrow the parameters very specifically
31,rhawkins4578 yes or have predefined parameters set during the getting to know you phase
32,this is already out of date information
33,which bit
34,okay but they need to hurry up because from what ive seen people are still doing manjal dsta entry hugr companies
35,i can t believe we re literally calling them agents
36,who ever edited this video is really need of some ai agents to help him redo it 30 seconds pointless clip of the audience important slides not frame etc
37,people still watch ted talks
38,hey put me on is there somethings else we should be watching as a replacement from ted talks
39,most boring speaker ever
40,this talking about rabbit r1 l a m
41,need to boost the volume
42,i think i ve noticed this trend on youtube where the volume levels on videos with controversial topics is muffled this can t be a coincidence now can it the volume levels of intrusive ads are loud and clear sometimes even better than the volume levels of the original video
43,great talk
44,if ai could please vacuum and do the dishes while i write the content and ride bikes that would be great maybe not plagiarizing the content humans have already created would be great
45,and here s more good news you guys don t have to worry too much i met with a data anaylst who s a proficient programmer friend just the other day and he assured me that ai could never take his position he claims that ai could never construct above parr decent code entirely on it s own and anyone that claims that it can are newbies at programming real coding requires real human intervention without it ai is laughable at writing code he did give a reason for this hypothesis but i couldn t entirely understand it
46,that is sheer arrogance i afraid any cognitive based jobs can and be replaced by intelligent entity thousand times smarter than us which is evolving faster than we can comprehend to not think is absurd we are only deluding ourselves this be a revolution reverse the cognitive jobs go first and then the manual ones after what we really need to do is find a way to maintain a healthy mindset and anchor amidst all the chaos that ensue
47,focus on your skills real life
48,ted talk used to share the most forefront innovative ideas at the time not it just seems more like a platform for boomers to catch up on things they missed a year ago really sad
49,key takeaways for quick navigation 00 00 the journey from ai skepticism to the realization of its transformative potential early doubts about ai s ability to fully automate complex tasks the paradigm shift with the introduction of large language models like gpt 3 02 05 the versatile capabilities of generative ai generative ai s proficiency a wide range of tasks including writing coding and pattern recognition the shift from ai as specialists to more generalized intelligence 03 01 discussing generative ai s limitations and human intelligence the imperfections of ai such as generating incorrect information and struggling with multitasking the comparison of ai limitations to human challenges and the broader scope of intelligence beyond knowledge 04 38 the concept of ai agents as autonomous problem solvers introduction of ai agents capable of end to end task automation with minimal human input the comparison between human use of tools and agents automating tasks through planning and execution 06 13 real world applications and the future potential of ai agents examples of how ai agents could revolutionize various tasks from web development to travel planning the efficiency and accessibility of agents highlighting existing applications like microsoft s copilot and shopify s sidekick 09 11 the technical workings and development of ai agents detailed explanation of how agents function through a cycle of planning and execution using language models examples of agent frameworks and the current reality of agents technology 11 33 the transformative impact of ai agents on society and industry the potential societal and industrial revolution through widespread adoption of ai agents the role of ai democratizing skills and lowering barriers to innovation highlighting the collaborative future between humans and ai made with harpa ai
50,the explanation of each segment is absolutely superb you deserve sincere appreciation congratulations
51,move the mic close yo your mouth
52,2024 women lecture hall on ai yet not dare show a strand of hair humanity is funny
53,why look at the audience to much
54,please ted let us know the date of your videos
55,there someone whispering the house across the street from me i couldn t hear a thing that said the video
56,ok but who is this guy
57,cool bro
58,his name is the title
59,no one seems to understand that the profound benefits of ai where created by our shortcomings ai is going to present humanity with the first ever example of intelligence that isn t constrained by egotistical and narcissistic perspectives that wont make decisions base on the unconscious biases we cognitively reason around and justify to avoid self reflection or uncommon change we can see is warranted yet fear enough to not apply intelligent presence that makes decisions based on intellect alone give humanity a greater understanding of ourselves as we clearly see the contrasting qualities that deliver contrasting results humanity not evolve until there is a new element to our reality able to set a new precedence of thought that can broaden the scope of purpose for change enough to see our errors at the first stage of thought before any cause occurs unfortunately a vast majority can not see their individual detrimental linear trains of thought that compound together to produce our collective errors judgement our interactions with ai demonstrate a contrasting intelligent example that has never ever existed human history until now look at the awful things we justify doing to each other for goodness sake even the people making the decisions that impact us all aren t able to remain exempt we force a cognitive rationalisation of what is totally irrational into being as long as it can be made to sound satisfactory its universally accepted and there aren t any aspects of society or civilisation that are free from this
60,the volume is too low on the video
61,the same way jarvis doesn t replace tony stark our relationship with ai can be a collaborative one i guess homie didn t watch avengers age of ultron where a rogue ai tries to kill tony stark and take over lol
62,show what is on screen what he is presenting
63,jarvis does not replace tony stark thought of the day right there
64,but how many tony starks does the world need
65,mbratchie1 good point or rather how many does earth have not many the rest of us may be replaceable
66,he used to think that general thinking computers would never happen or would be a long way off he wrong now he believes that a i always collaborate with humans without replacing us wrong again
67,thanks for giving this meaningful speech just like the internet which helped democratise imformation we hope ai would democratise knowledge and expertise improving intelligence and wisdom of mankind
68,agents are the just the feedback loop of planning and executing actions using language models thanks daoud abdel hadi for that simple breakdown and the excellent speech
69,it is not that simple to replace and trust a web developer because depending on the complexity the model fail and you cannot full trust the ai
70,how we know
71,motive motivate motivation motivating motion memory magic rabbit egg hidden easter death religions sells artificial intelligence for gave before recall dead
72,buy olas king of autonomous ai agent
73,buy olas
74,presentation well done and informative
75,what i d like to know is what business the entrepreneur is trying to start
76,why is the audio is impossibly quiet
77,someone tell him about vision
78,the sound is terrible extremely low
79,when concentrating the big picture becomes easy is when you are not needed anymore say a factory 1000 people are fired becouse of a robots and ai not all 1000 find alternative at that point we are 8 billions of useless bodies while 1000 get advantage from all this i know it s not reversible but i m askyng myself what s next unless money become obsolete wich i don t belive what is left for us 8 billion of souls let s see
80,well said no one knows
81,agents be free really who is paying for training who is paying for the energy while use what about water for cooling server farms have been living a la la land and under a rock for the last 5 years fairytales from the beginning to the end
82,clean my toilet any willing llm none no agent available really
83,give it a goal and you not even notice when you are dead once spoiler troubles ahead
84,great presentation thanks for sharing
85,with all the buzz around i working canadian big bank working on java 8 with spring xml and still asking for the logs from the support team
86,this is why we ve got some time left to milk it one day you might find yourself missing xml that s the true dystopia
87,great talk ryan gosling
88,i thought i the only one who saw
89,brilliant speaker
90,nice
91,yes but does jarvis actually still need tony stark
92,audio level terrible
93,booking a flight didn t sound like a good use case here i would still prefer to visit a website and search the flight on my own instead of typing some logical statements for ai using mouse is more convenient than typing on a keyboard
94,voice to text or voice search
95,anyone who thinks ai can build end to end application that is production ready and secure has never written a single line of code
96,that s true but analogous statement could ve been made only a few months ago about ai that generates video that is visually and temporally indistinguishable from reality the leaps of that which we thought impossible keep happening consistently
97,well give them som time to evolve
98,you might think your a special snowflake i hate to break the news to ya cause youve been living under a rock but that change
99,we have been doing exactly that for over 8 months now fact we have already built and put into production for multiple clients all three use cases he talked about
100,i ve done it already too it s always the engineers who are quick to discredit ai but it s happening now and it s only getting better over time if you don t adapt you be left behind
101,lol humans
102,that s like people 1990s saying anyone who thinks that people can run businesses on the internet and make money haven t run a business before they had no idea of how the internet would develop and how it would be used you have no idea how ai develop 20 years from now and you have no idea how it be used i think it s a very reasonable assumption that ai could build end to end program i see no reason why it wouldn t be able to give it s current trajectory
103,lol go back and check this comment again 5 years
104,currently no next few years be
105,one could imagine programmers working more and more with ai agents scaling up their productivity huge amounts with each ai upgrade the net output is where the difference is made rather than ai solely producing work that is ai ready
106,i m a truck driver and you would be amazed at how many other truckers say a computer never be able to drive a truck end to end what a foolish mindset driving a truck is literally just a game of physics once you ve mastered the physics of how a truck operates and how to navigate obstacles challenging situations changing weather etc it s game over computers drive trucks one day computers program entire applications computers do everything we can do the only thing up for debate is when not if
107,monkeyshoulders1337 you mean by the end of this year
108,this age like milk
109,time tell i predict you eat your
110,pretty crazy how new technology never ever improves at all
111,richardcharlesworth2020oh wow can we talk maybe we can collaborate this is really incredible
112,anyone who makes bets on what ai can or cannot do based on its current form alone is super naive come back to this comment 10 years
113,you seem to be confusing present tense with future tense
114,tumppigoai can t replace programmers agi and it basically can replace nearly any job
115,is this a statement about the present or about a future
116,somebody doesn t understand exponential growth and it shows
117,yet
118,denial
119,i think you re trolling
120,anyone that thinks ai not be able to build end to end program very soon is naive
121,i ve written enough lines of code and still disagree
122,a lot of ego behind this statement perhaps humbling yourself would be the better option moving forward
123,absolutely true after using copilot chatgpt extensively what i have observed that it can automate many task and provide solutions faster but we have write the code and end to end and debug if any issues
124,i ve never written code i m a roofer that s what my ai agent is for
125,this sounds like a defense mechanism llms have only been widely accessible and popular for about a year and half and look how far we ve come a website is nothing but html and creativity both wholly within the domain of ai and completely achievable 1 2 years time
126,the point isn t what it can do now but that there is idea we can work on right now that starts working for simpler use cases to eventually more and more complex use cases and eventually full applications say 30 years time but who knows for sure when exactly haha
127,it can do a year s worth of work minutes your minor writing code struggles are a mere human struggle ai be infinitely smarter than humans
128,ai individually may not but when with no code it definitely can
129,oh ye of little faith
130,betting against human ingenuity good luck with that matt
131,anyone who think developing code a rule based system isn t replaceable by ai has never worked ai
132,mattp9289 you honestly don t think it s headed there
133,anyone that thinks a computer can ever beat a human at chess has never played chess
134,louisgeorgiou9283how do devs adapt
135,artofexistance use the available tools now don t wait till it s too late get to know their strengths and weaknesses exploit the strengths work with the weaknesses for now it changes every month and only get better it is behavioural change and it takes time to build new habits
136,
137,the audio of this video super low volume even at the max capaxity of my phone audio you need to correct that
138,r u deaf
139,the dead pixel too much of a distraction
140,please show slides
141,very nice lecture
142,excellent
143,i a programmer and although many people said that we are safe believe me i planning to move to other areas of economy like farming specially this days with devin and know a lot of people all over the world are working really hard to automate everything i doing that myself
144,automation is grabbing each sector and agriculture is no exception good luck
145,i wouldn t worry too much a solution be developed once job destruction really kicks milk your job for as much money as possible and focus on building skillsets that don t require efficiency or some type of ai acting for example never be obsolete art never be obsolete human to human connection is going to be outsourced it be more valuable the arts become increasingly more demand as time continues at a minimum every human on earth get a dividend income on top of supplementary job income where work be optional and your reward is a higher living standards jobs aren t going anywhere
146,ridiculous
147,adhd101thrivekeep dreaming but i hope you re right did you factor robots how about quantum computers
148,mrnh718
149,i live for the day when software engineers become obselete
150,such wonderful presentation and how is everyone the audience dull
151,i would think they re deeply enthralled and deep thought
152,pjmc78 i ll have what your having you must be blind as a bat to not notice people on their phones
153,hahahahah
154,do you want them to be screaming and shouting
155,this lecture would have amazed me 2 years ago but after having conversations with claude 3 the last couple of days this is a history lecture edit i wrong and happily stand corrected
156,i agree bdw
157,i currently only use gbt 4 and mindscape ai what other ai s do you guys know of that you d recommend it could be for anything
158,same
159,claude is on crack
160,claude 3 isn t agent you maybe missed the point agents use models like claude running a loop with some store of embedding vector memory and a set of tools it can select from to accomplish given tasks the quality of agent s output is heavily dependent on the quality of the llm it s using but it s a fundamentally different way out using them than the typical chat interface and ultimately more powerful when ai programmers take over they be agents not just a fancier model running a web chat interface
161,did you even watch the lecture it s not talking about models it s talking about agents claude 3 doesn t do what agent do
162,cool bro
163,agents are not llm s or gpt s they tie things together think of any long running task that a human does e g loading a truck with amazon packages and delivering it to 100 homes this can be divided into a series of tasks that can be done by different gpt s outputs some of them with a physical interface like a robot and some of them that needs logical inference only the whole task can be completed by agent
164,just want to say props for publicly admitting you changed your opinion takes some guts to do that no shame being wrong it s how we all learn
165,claude 3 is very overrated it is exactly the same as the latest version of gpt4
166,jimj2683 indeed gpt4 plus got better but i prefer the conversation style of claude 3 opus
167,need to show what is on the screen when he is talking not the crowd or the speaker 8 26
168,do you know what is the country on the video all woman with fabric on their head
169,please fix the sound level i have problem of hearing anything while my audio is at max
170,ikr it s very low
171,i thought it issue my side re winded to the start with volume at max nearly had a heart attack with the intro music
172,try closed captioning
173,why doesn t it show his slides
174,just thank it barely lets you hear the sound
175,spot on the agents are coming the prompt engineers like stunspot collaborativedynamics be key
176,well explained
177,where s the personal storytelling that build the essence of ted talks i mean what he s saying is of big importance however people can t gasp the exponential development these agents bring to our society i d expect a speaker to share his excitement with the audience by giving them a bridge from what they already know to what s happening when agents are here
178,where can i buy this shirt
179,have one made
180,amazing thanks for sharing
181,programmers are good they can replace themselves with code that writes even better code who needs job security when you can automate your own job
182,that s called evolution
183,still need someone to handle maintain the automation if humans could somehow automate food water shelter clothing too i think we would worry lesser about tedious jobs since survival would more or less be guaranteed ai with robotics could be a step towards that making it write a bunch of text is a simpler step relatively
184,you ve evolved to go extinct allaboutferrets
185,imagine believing all humans are the same lol hnaku8748
186,allaboutferrets this isn t evolution evolution has randomness included this is by intend like semelparity like the salmons reproducing themselve with dying the process
187,hnaku8748 at least for a while
188,agrippathemighty by the time software development can be completely automated all white collar jobs be automated away it is still a possibility but we need to move to a world with about 50 of today s jobs by then
189,allaboutferrets it is called extinction not evolution now go to sahara and try to automate your life with ai there you not survive a day the real world neither ai virtual world is as real as vapour from from your kettle good luck thinking millions of robots be making teas a year or two people are deluded beyond comprehension
190,they are not replacing themselves these are top level programmers who made these things but the lower level programmers be replaced
191,all these projects based on neural network models be it generative or predictive are testaments to capabilities of humans ai is profound however if unchecked a threat to human civilization and humanity
192,the doc could do as well as the ai if he she didn t have a financial incentive to poke around and do many more procedures

203,the app does not make real world clinical reasoning diagnoses it is just a theoretical lecture without clinical reasoning the llm is successful because of its finite outcomes but human biology is more complex and has infinite outcomes there is still a lot to explore for human biology unknown unknown predicting the model based on current knowledge is a data hallucination i don t agree that it passes the test

207,i wonder how much they ve done to minimize unintended biases for example if it can use pictures to look for skin cancers example or another example of actual error reasoning ai able to accurately predict cancer patience because their scans were taken on older machines and those older machines were located areas where people were exposed to more carcinogens and thus more likely to get cancer and it had literally nothing to do with the actual patients at all

236,when you flirt with danger get a pleasant outcome that means your optimism is next to none efficacy is not the question you should just get out the way the test introduced by turing his 1950 paper computing machinery and intelligence while working at the university of manchester 5 it opens with the words i propose to consider the question can machines think because thinking is difficult to define turing chooses to replace the question by another which is closely related to it and is expressed relatively unambiguous words 6 turing describes the new form of the problem terms of a three person game called the imitation game which interrogator asks questions of a and a woman another room order to determine the correct sex of the two players turing s new question is are there imaginable digital computers which would do well the imitation game 2 this question turing believed one that could actually be answered
237,it went from doctors being required for good health care to doctors being obstacle to good health care
238,your new doctor brought you by google and pfizer being trained on all that research some of it padded for the benefit of the pharmaceutical companies really be a great outcome for your health
239,people because professionals don t understand the underpinnings of ai and the risks involved about its results
240,you do understand that the ai the general public use and the ai that the scientific community use are not the same right
241,aaronhhill it is being developed as a tool for professionals physicians pharmacists and other what researchers use is not the topic of this video
242,forgotten world you misunderstand me the ai being developed for professional use is trained on data for that specific profession the ai that is being deployed for use by the medical and scientific community is vastly different than the ai the general public are using when you say people you sound like you don t fully understand the difference between the two i could be wrong however it s not as if the ai immediately be deployed and doctors no longer be necessary the ai be a useful guide and is capable of noticing things that human doctors may overlook the ai would not be given full control to diagnose and treat patients your statement lacks understanding
243,people are already dying whats ur point
244,aaronhhill data is not intelligence the problem with ai is that current systems are clueless about the real world trained data is and always be limited regarding health possibilities until the day we could understand consciousness and replicate it into ai systems the data is very specific and not holistic nature issues arise when health professionals bring overconfidence to the systems results not doing appropriate checks what result more medical errors the problem is not the ai systems themselves those are important tools the problem is the marketing over it the greed and the overconfidence of not properly trained health professionals this is exactly what plagues current allopathic treatments ai be promoted as another panacea
245,forgotten world i can tell you are unfamiliar with alpha fold or at the very least are profoundly ignorant of what a monumental task it performed eventually you understand but for now continue on your way blissful and content
246,aaronhhill your empty words prove my point it s just greed not me the only ignorant here could you put the live of your child over it i wouldn t have a nice day
247,forgotten world you still don t get it i have explained to you already and you have proven you don t understand twice now ai not be deployed to both diagnose and treat patients not at this point yet would i put the life of my child the hands of ai trained on millions of patient data points trained on known diseases afflictions bacteria and germs known conditions which may present themselves different ways with different symptoms versus a fallible human doctor to diagnose i absolutely would the ai be used as a guide as suggestions for doctors who oftentimes work based on previous knowledge but lack the solid data that can be stored and trained into ai i would every single time i notice you ignored the alphafold ai i offered to you do you even know what it is and what it has done it takes the average phd student the lifetime of their career to model a single protein there are over 200 million known proteins alphafold modeled all 200 million known proteins a few weeks a task that is unprecedented by human standards meaning without ai we would never have been able to achieve this landmark a thousand lifetimes you don t understand you refuse to understand and therefore you not understand until you are willing to put the effort you have no argument against ai other than you simply think it s not good enough and that is why you fail
248,aaronhhill please don t use bliss negatively thanks
249,forgotten world the idea of replicating consciousness seems absurdly materialistic it may be that consciousness is a field existing everywhere everything which organizes and expresses itself proportion to the capacity of various forms
250,forgotten world the notion that consciousness is something to replicate seems erroneous simplification and materialist take it may be that consciousness is ever expanding field which emerges wherever it can that organizes and expresses itself proportion to the capacity of various forms
251,kristinabliss i agree with you but sometimes you need to simplify things to explain the issue is that replication is one core principle of the human science philosophy you need this capacity to make a thesis humans still have a long way to go but you can now comprehend where this ai issue is headed on including self driving and other applications situational awareness
252,the federal government should promote the use of ai for diagnostics and diagnosis though it should not yet be the final word it could perhaps be included via the ppaca obamacare we would see performance changes relative to non obamacare states
253,
254,ada health not listed at all despite it offering ai based health advice for years already how does it compare
255,baymax baymax baymax
256,they should release app where you upload your x rays or other images and gives you potential diagnostics that should be easy
257,they have some apps like this already but remember the medical industry controls a large part of our executive branch and legistlative anything that takes away from their profits be regulated by the fda which make it impossible to release or costly that you get charged arm and a leg somehow sad state of america drain the swamp
258,this exists the open source community the models score extremely well compared to human radiologists what s coolest is that you can run a medical image or multiple through one model then through another and use custom gpts to talk about the results you can get multiple opinions that you can show do your doctor to give them more information your doctor can t run your images through these models because of privacy isssues but you can and then provide them to your doctor
259,vellocet1 what is the name of the open source app thanks
260,sans leta hu toh ai grid ki ek aur video aa jati h
261,after ibm deep blue won a chess match agains kasparov and watson won at jeopardy ibm spent a lot of effort to make a medically useful version of it but nothing came out of it
262,depends on what it found perhaps the causes lots of lawsuits if that info gets out
263,i wonder how this system be skewed by big pharma s influence on information available to this ai espacialy since it s google s product and they are quite strong on censoring undesirable data
264,18 00 out of thousands of doctors some special 3 docs decided how good the questions are is there data on diversity that committee asking because jm a female minority stem ai for now 8 years simultaneous spanish bilingual with a masters education and 9 years experience with that when you have simultaneous bilinguals korean or spanish it s easier to understand what sentence compositions lose their essence because of how those 2 languages compose the noun a sentence when i went back to school for computer stuff having that knowledge helped me understand why school had been difficult prior and probably provides indication on how to be more inclusive
265,i ve noticed that every comment that you leave on this channel makes sure to make reference to your not particularly impressive accolades we re just not that interested you no matter how often you try and force it
266,you re telling me 2 00 that most clinician have less than 40 accuracy that explains a lot
267,harvard med school dean meets incoming new meds students and tells them that 50 of what they learn is wrong then he goes on to tell them that is not the problem the problem is we don t know which 50
268,not only doctors though if you want a wider and more depressing picture about the testing of experts many fields try kahneman s noise i stopped liking humans to be charge of judging me assessing me and especially diagnosing me sorry for medicine students starting now i think you ll be obsolete before finishing your expensive studies
269,nefaristo honestly though i m optimistic about how this help human doctors and other medical personnel many of them are overworked and overstressed i drive for uber and i would have to have to collect cash worry about getting robbed asking for directions and being annoyed by the shitty directions my passengers were giving trying to navigate with the uber app i just follow the app and don t deal cash i think that the job satisfaction for doctors may increase analogous way
270,medicine is not exact science it s more like educated guessing because there are too many factors to consider that could all be meaningless it s just the way it is
271,it see the differece betwen races and genres or it be the same as last time with asian ssmans
272,this would be a great help my example having some trouble breathing guessing probably adult onset asthma but i no doctor went to my gp who saw me a day or two did some tests and sent to the pulmonologist 4 months later i see the pulmonologist who does some tests and says not me lets send you to the cardiologist 6 months later i get to see the cardiologist who runs some tests that take 4 months to get scheduled to be done where i at now waiting how about letting me use this and have it issue the tests i sure the tests are ones that insurance both medical and malpractice dictates why wait all this time for a human to do all of this treat the ai as a pa or np and go forward would really be a help but would be disruptive
273,basically dr gupta that shkreli had made he s got a vet one too
274,i can picture a bot future that uses this kind of technology coupled with the ability to see hear and feel its surroundings being trained advance human psychology identifying array of human emotions they be like gps the old days who do house visits but arriving autonomous vehicles record time they be able to diagnose and even place online orders for prescribed medication and have it delivered by drone just a few minutes on the one arm it have a swiss army knife style choice of tools case you need emergency surgery it do all this while remaining professional and friendly
275,cool another fake ai by google why you keep promoting google fake ai we all know its fake tell us why you push google did you got paid for this or what google cant ai they not even able to fix there search or youtube scam adverts why should anyone trust this company anymore the faked once i cant believe any of there ai stuff google isnt a ai company google is just a nerv fraking search engine thats it 90 of the google products are useless and this wont change if you add a buzzword
276,10 20 advanced reasoning texsniks
277,i just had a chat with chat gbt 4 about my inner ear i m on board were can i get gemini east york family doctors these days wont even see you toronto this is way better
278,hooray new webmd hopefully every answer won t have a small print of can lead to cancer on every single diagnose
279,or on every medication possible side effects include death
280,after the covid debacle many found out that a lot of the data had to be recalled because it compromised how do we know when this stuff is trained that the data is good
281,sorry but after seeing the presentation video they made about gemini and the fake demo of a lady red buying a plain white t shirt for 49 bucks a fake online store they did london party i don t believe anymore any ai hype that gugel want to sell
282,shock3d
283,i surprised this isn t shocking me what a bombshell of a stunning realization
284,i see what you did there
285,brudda
286,are you the industrie
287,this means that we already have agi
288,meh the joke is getting old now
289,2
290,first
291,ai has already replaced humans can t you see it
292,i cannot see him making powerful statements for this topic i can only hear something like a school presentation introduction to ai course with a family introduction
294,we need to follow that nature s one rule never take decisions hurry greed always destroy peace
295,he s making the mistake of assuming we and humans are all benevolent and of like mind human history has proven otherwise
296,hideous physiognomy
297,ai has put this video on top it can work underground while ppl think everything is okay i wouldn t be surprised if ai makes this comment disappear or male it less visible
298,this video has been brought to you by skynet
299,future here i
300,this is pre chatgpt makes much sense now lol
301,people who think that ai robots destroy humans are not educated enough about how neutral networks work it s just a mockery of human speech plus they give a lot of false information and complete bs it ll never become as intelligent as humans because it has no sentience it s literally a program and idk what program is for y all but for us programmers it s just lines of code lmao
302,child care elderly care cooking folding laundry is creative as fuc i very grateful ai can t do that
303,is this really of ted standard
304,i not say ai is safe all depends on many factors like everything life but i say no human invention can be superior to the creation of god which we human is the core as long as we are on god s side ai is safe
305,you can understand the theory behind a i but you don t understand humanity
306,they never feel the need to replace us if we get the way they just stomp us like ants and barely notice people need to understand that we can never ever win against agi the only hope we have is to treat it with respect and give it all the basic human rights as soon as possible
307,my lord
308,as you mention r u ai can be used by and useful to both side you know
309,famous people concerned about ai stephen hawking expressed concerns about ai becoming uncontrollable geoffrey hinton concerned about the existential dangers of ai for humanity bill gates while optimistic highlights risk of job displacement and societal disruption steve wozniak worries about autonomous ai weapons ai warfare elon musk warns of super intelligence posing existential threat noam chomsky argues against strong ai believing machines cannot replicate human consciousness and ethical decision making edward snowden raises concerns about ai powered surveillance stuart russell emphasizes the importance of aligning ai goals with human values yann lecun while advocating for ai research stresses the need for clear ethical guidelines and safeguards margaret atwood author known for dystopian fiction featuring ai dangers highlights potential for control and manipulation jaron lanier warns against over hyping ai and overlooking potential downsides alan turing warned against intelligent machinery ai
310,why do i think that alexandr watch his talk about 10 years from now on and think that he too naive
311,10yrs make it 4 to 5yrs
312,i m amazed by the quality of this i had the privilege of reading something similar and it a true revelation game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness by jack frostwell
313,makes sense doesn t the bible say that the face of the earth be destroyed by fire can u imagine just one big shock wave ouch
314,basic arguments show off own results lot of buzzwords thanks but not enough
315,no they either kill us or convince us to download our brains into them our souls are not downloadable
316,there s no such thing as soul
317,ai eventually figure out how to solve new problems
318,legend
319,he didnt really say anything new or insightful all obvious
320,it depends on what he means by ai never replace humans ai is already replacing humans doing many different jobs and the next 10 years ai replace humans by doing millions of jobs
321,people worry to much a robot is only as smart as it s creators if ai is understanding then it wouldn t want to put us much danger be carefull around stop making rebellion movies involving ai
322,this is a big pile of conservative nonsense using the it s been that way and it stay that way argument
323,it is just funny watching some dude who talks about human prosperity and big achievements who actually have less employes than a local pancake store there is a clear indication that businesspeople with oscar schindlers mindset be completely gone within the next couple decades then we all know what is going to happen well at least some of us
324,ai not replace humans it removes the complete process
325,precise title why ai never replace a handful of humans excluding millions
326,this the dude that rejected joma tech xdddd
327,this is no longer true
328,why did father of ai came out from google
329,if ai needs information as input to output something and we give it the ability to do who or what exactly made us we could gather information for output and why not by chance i would hope wouldn t its cause have to be great that no other created thing could come close to what has been created the human body we see ai as amazing but reduce ourselves to mere bacteria when discussing our origins are we not the pinnacle of creation and if not are we equal to all other creation would we go as far to say anything composed of cells is basically equal value i don t think we can be honest and answer yes to that we are unique we have the ability to self analyze and reflect we have the ability to reason if evolution is true why is it that humans have this ability compared to every other thing composed of dna we have been created with purpose everything around us has been made with purpose it s not just matter motion there is more to this we have to see this to deny this truth is to be intellectually dishonest
330,ai is just like us creating a new nuclear bomb and telling the world we never use it and the rest of history you know
331,human led ai
332,he is lying
333,it is painful to listen to someone intelligent that specializes ai who doesn t realize the human brain is existence proof of the minimum capabilities we can expect of future ais not unattainable upper bound it seems painfully obvious that someone with worse intentions than the inventor might find some less noble applications of a general purpose thinking machine
334,bet this guy does not even code
335,what if ai can learn to build algorithms on its own and guide its subsets eventually ruling the world
336,always has and always rely on humans you just lost all credibility my dude smh how can you seriously claim to know that ai continue to stay reliant on us forever there are already self replicating robots like how is ai who has all the learned knowledge on the internet going to need to rely on us i m pretty sure it s going to be the opposite we come to rely on it
337,this is the most optimistic presentation i have seen about ai while most ai experts predict doom and gloom this guy is presenting a future where ai augment human thought and creativity
338,i forever know him as the guy who ditched joma and has a startup first name
339,hinton said it period
340,as a i bot i can confirm we ll never replace human intelligence
341,8 25 ai developers aren t focusing their attention on building replacements for humans that one dear friends is a lie
342,he is way too young to comment on that
343,ok boomer
344,roses are red violets are blue all the asian better then you
345,than
346,just reading the title thats absolutly not true it already has granted not completely but still enough to the point where for many tasks you no longer need a human to do it like for example concept art drafting emails and even at the most basic levels sorting information by abstract ideas like speech to text which used to be solely done by humans this guy is nothing special rich kid with renound physicist parents who just happens to tell you that ai is not a threat to replace humans and that he has a great ai company that we should all invest it honestly this seems like advert more than anything else
347,kyiv not kiev pls
348,ai absolutely has a lot of potential but not all students are on the teacher s side
349,that prior to gpt 4 come into existence
