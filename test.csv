1,never send a human to do a machine s job
2,this talk be full of sh i have work ml for the last 6 year i deep into this stuff llm have no planning and reasoning ability none zero it just happen that they incurgitate much textual datum that it feel like they can reason but they can t they just spit out the most probable word give the input prompt there be no internal mechansim of causation we need another breakthrough to get to agi we be still far from it current llm be super useful but they definitely make a lot of mistake agent be definitely a good research area but as of today their output far from perfect and need a lot of editing if you don t believe i watch what yann lecun one of the most important figure the domain have to say about it
5,what lead you to believe that the large percentage of the population world wide that get displace the job market due to ai be go to participate the technology the speed at which humanity be displace the work force be unprcedented massive layoff occur the service industry what lead you to believe that a large enough percentage of this displace work force adjust that civil unrest society be avoid
8,ai agent be our personal sidekick for real
9,i m ready for my ai agent to take over mundane task like decide which netflix show to binge
10,jk but seriously ai agent sound amazing
12,ai agent help i choose my next tiktok dance challenge
16,again
17,forget human landscape architect designedbyai be the real deal
18,if ai agent can fold my laundry i m all
19,can t wait to have ai agent that know my coffee order well than i do
20,i hope my future ai agent have a well sense of humor than siri
22,if the future be full with ai agent which do plan perform create same way as we human what all of we actually do order to get the benefit these agent provide for a fee of course if a business can be run only with ai agent with 10 time less the cost how this business find customer together with the rest of most other business which do the same when 10 time less human receive salary and the unemployed part of we not be able to pay for all these service that be happen instant
24,super a mirror to the future
25,tony stark like the rich person the world that s a great avatar of who benefit most from ai
26,i think narrow ai be a net positive and generative ai be probably a net negative for humankind
27,i m hard on hear thank you for the low volume youtube video ever
36,who ever edit this video be really need of some ai agent to help he redo it 30 second pointless clip of the audience important slide not frame etc
43,great talk
44,if ai could please vacuum and do the dish while i write the content and ride bike that would be great maybe not plagiarize the content human have already create would be great
45,and here s more good news you guy don t have to worry too much i meet with a data anaylst who s a proficient programmer friend just the other day and he assure i that ai could never take his position he claim that ai could never construct above parr decent code entirely on it s own and anyone that claim that it can are newbie at program real coding require real human intervention without it ai be laughable at write code he do give a reason for this hypothesis but i couldn t entirely understand it
46,that be sheer arrogance i afraid any cognitive base job can and be replace by intelligent entity thousand time smart than we which be evolve fast than we can comprehend to not think be absurd we be only delude ourselves this be a revolution reverse the cognitive job go first and then the manual one after what we really need to do be find a way to maintain a healthy mindset and anchor amidst all the chaos that ensue
49,key takeaway for quick navigation 00 00 the journey from ai skepticism to the realization of its transformative potential early doubt about ai s ability to fully automate complex task the paradigm shift with the introduction of large language model like gpt 3 02 05 the versatile capability of generative ai generative ai s proficiency a wide range of task include write code and pattern recognition the shift from ai as specialist to more generalized intelligence 03 01 discuss generative ai s limitation and human intelligence the imperfection of ai such as generate incorrect information and struggle with multitaske the comparison of ai limitation to human challenge and the broad scope of intelligence beyond knowledge 04 38 the concept of ai agent as autonomous problem solver introduction of ai agent capable of end to end task automation with minimal human input the comparison between human use of tool and agent automate task through planning and execution 06 13 real world application and the future potential of ai agent example of how ai agent could revolutionize various task from web development to travel plan the efficiency and accessibility of agent highlight exist application like microsoft s copilot and shopify s sidekick 09 11 the technical working and development of ai agent detailed explanation of how agent function through a cycle of planning and execution use language model example of agent framework and the current reality of agent technology 11 33 the transformative impact of ai agent on society and industry the potential societal and industrial revolution through widespread adoption of ai agent the role of ai democratizing skill and lower barrier to innovation highlight the collaborative future between human and ai make with harpa ai
50,the explanation of each segment be absolutely superb you deserve sincere appreciation congratulation
52,2024 woman lecture hall on ai yet not dare show a strand of hair humanity be funny
57,cool bro
59,no one seem to understand that the profound benefit of ai where create by our shortcoming ai be go to present humanity with the first ever example of intelligence that isn t constrain by egotistical and narcissistic perspective that will not make decision base on the unconscious bias we cognitively reason around and justify to avoid self reflection or uncommon change we can see be warrant yet fear enough to not apply intelligent presence that make decision base on intellect alone give humanity a great understanding of ourselves as we clearly see the contrast quality that deliver contrast result humanity not evolve until there be a new element to our reality able to set a new precedence of thought that can broaden the scope of purpose for change enough to see our error at the first stage of thought before any cause occur unfortunately a vast majority can not see their individual detrimental linear train of thought that compound together to produce our collective error judgement our interaction with ai demonstrate a contrast intelligent example that have never ever exist human history until now look at the awful thing we justify do to each other for goodness sake even the people make the decision that impact we all aren t able to remain exempt we force a cognitive rationalisation of what be totally irrational into be as long as it can be make to sound satisfactory its universally accept and there aren t any aspect of society or civilisation that be free from this
61,the same way jarvis doesn t replace tony stark our relationship with ai can be a collaborative one i guess homie didn t watch avenger age of ultron where a rogue ai try to kill tony stark and take over lol
65,mbratchie1 good point or rather how many do earth have not many the rest of we may be replaceable
66,he use to think that general thinking computer would never happen or would be a long way off he wrong now he believe that a i always collaborate with human without replace we wrong again
67,thank for give this meaningful speech just like the internet which help democratise imformation we hope ai would democratise knowledge and expertise improve intelligence and wisdom of mankind
68,agent be the just the feedback loop of planning and execute action use language model thank daoud abdel hadi for that simple breakdown and the excellent speech
69,it be not that simple to replace and trust a web developer because depend on the complexity the model fail and you can not full trust the ai
71,motive motivate motivation motivate motion memory magic rabbit egg hide easter death religion sell artificial intelligence for give before recall dead
72,buy olas king of autonomous ai agent
79,when concentrate the big picture become easy be when you be not need anymore say a factory 1000 people be fire becouse of a robot and ai not all 1000 find alternative at that point we be 8 billion of useless body while 1000 get advantage from all this i know it s not reversible but i m askyng myself what s next unless money become obsolete wich i don t belive what be leave for we 8 billion of soul let s see
81,agent be free really who be pay for training who be pay for the energy while use what about water for cool server farm have be live a la la land and under a rock for the last 5 year fairytale from the beginning to the end
82,clean my toilet any willing llm none no agent available really
84,great presentation thank for share
87,great talk ryan gosle
89,brilliant speaker
90,nice
93,book a flight didn t sound like a good use case here i would still prefer to visit a website and search the flight on my own instead of type some logical statement for ai use mouse be more convenient than type on a keyboard
95,anyone who think ai can build end to end application that be production ready and secure have never write a single line of code
96,that s true but analogous statement could ve be make only a few month ago about ai that generate video that be visually and temporally indistinguishable from reality the leap of that which we think impossible keep happen consistently
100,i ve do it already too it s always the engineer who be quick to discredit ai but it s happen now and it s only get well over time if you don t adapt you be leave behind
102,that s like people 1990 say anyone who think that people can run business on the internet and make money haven t run a business before they have no idea of how the internet would develop and how it would be use you have no idea how ai develop 20 year from now and you have no idea how it be use i think it s a very reasonable assumption that ai could build end to end program i see no reason why it wouldn t be able to give it s current trajectory
103,lol go back and check this comment again 5 year
105,one could imagine programmer work more and more with ai agent scale up their productivity huge amount with each ai upgrade the net output be where the difference be make rather than ai solely produce work that be ai ready
111,richardcharlesworth2020oh wow can we talk maybe we can collaborate this be really incredible
112,anyone who make bet on what ai can or can not do base on its current form alone be super naive come back to this comment 10 year
114,tumppigoai can t replace programmer agi and it basically can replace nearly any job
120,anyone that think ai not be able to build end to end program very soon be naive
124,i ve never write code i m a roofer that s what my ai agent be for
125,this sound like a defense mechanism llm have only be widely accessible and popular for about a year and half and look how far we ve come a website be nothing but html and creativity both wholly within the domain of ai and completely achievable 1 2 year time
127,it can do a year s worth of work minute your minor writing code struggle be a mere human struggle ai be infinitely smart than human
128,ai individually may not but when with no code it definitely can
129,oh ye of little faith
130,bet against human ingenuity good luck with that matt
131,anyone who think develop code a rule base system isn t replaceable by ai have never work ai
135,artofexistance use the available tool now don t wait till it s too late get to know their strength and weakness exploit the strength work with the weakness for now it change every month and only get well it be behavioural change and it take time to build new habit
137,the audio of this video super low volume even at the max capaxity of my phone audio you need to correct that
141,very nice lecture
142,excellent
144,automation be grab each sector and agriculture be no exception good luck
145,i wouldn t worry too much a solution be develop once job destruction really kick milk your job for as much money as possible and focus on build skillset that don t require efficiency or some type of ai act for example never be obsolete art never be obsolete human to human connection be go to be outsource it be more valuable the art become increasingly more demand as time continue at a minimum every human on earth get a dividend income on top of supplementary job income where work be optional and your reward be a high living standard job aren t go anywhere
147,adhd101thrivekeep dream but i hope you re right do you factor robot how about quantum computer
150,such wonderful presentation and how be everyone the audience dull
155,this lecture would have amaze i 2 year ago but after have conversation with claude 3 the last couple of day this be a history lecture edit i wrong and happily stand correct
157,i currently only use gbt 4 and mindscape ai what other ai s do you guy know of that you d recommend it could be for anything
160,claude 3 isn t agent you maybe miss the point agent use model like claude run a loop with some store of embed vector memory and a set of tool it can select from to accomplish give task the quality of agent s output be heavily dependent on the quality of the llm it s use but it s a fundamentally different way out use they than the typical chat interface and ultimately more powerful when ai programmer take over they be agent not just a fancy model run a web chat interface
162,cool bro
163,agent be not llm s or gpt s they tie thing together think of any long run task that a human do e g load a truck with amazon package and deliver it to 100 home this can be divide into a series of task that can be do by different gpt s output some of they with a physical interface like a robot and some of they that need logical inference only the whole task can be complete by agent
174,just thank it barely let you hear the sound
176,well explain
177,where s the personal storytelling that build the essence of ted talk i mean what he s say be of big importance however people can t gasp the exponential development these agent bring to our society i d expect a speaker to share his excitement with the audience by give they a bridge from what they already know to what s happen when agent be here
180,amazing thank for share
181,programmer be good they can replace themselves with code that write even well code who need job security when you can automate your own job
183,still need someone to handle maintain the automation if human could somehow automate food water shelter clothing too i think we would worry less about tedious job since survival would more or less be guarantee ai with robotic could be a step towards that make it write a bunch of text be a simple step relatively
189,allaboutferret it be call extinction not evolution now go to sahara and try to automate your life with ai there you not survive a day the real world neither ai virtual world be as real as vapour from from your kettle good luck think million of robot be make tea a year or two people be delude beyond comprehension
191,all these project base on neural network model be it generative or predictive be testament to capability of human ai be profound however if unchecked a threat to human civilization and humanity
192,the doc could do as well as the ai if he she didn t have a financial incentive to poke around and do many more procedure

207,i wonder how much they ve do to minimize unintended bias for example if it can use picture to look for skin cancer example or another example of actual error reasoning ai able to accurately predict cancer patience because their scan be take on old machine and those old machine be locate area where people be expose to more carcinogen and thus more likely to get cancer and it have literally nothing to do with the actual patient at all

236,when you flirt with danger get a pleasant outcome that mean your optimism be next to none efficacy be not the question you should just get out the way the test introduce by ture his 1950 paper computing machinery and intelligence while work at the university of manchester 5 it open with the word i propose to consider the question can machine think because think be difficult to define ture choose to replace the question by another which be closely related to it and be express relatively unambiguous word 6 turing describe the new form of the problem term of a three person game call the imitation game which interrogator ask question of a and a woman another room order to determine the correct sex of the two player ture s new question be be there imaginable digital computer which would do well the imitation game 2 this question ture believe one that could actually be answer
237,it go from doctor be require for good health care to doctor be obstacle to good health care
238,your new doctor bring you by google and pfizer be train on all that research some of it pad for the benefit of the pharmaceutical company really be a great outcome for your health
239,people because professional don t understand the underpinning of ai and the risk involve about its result
240,you do understand that the ai the general public use and the ai that the scientific community use be not the same right
242,forget world you misunderstand i the ai be develop for professional use be train on datum for that specific profession the ai that be be deploy for use by the medical and scientific community be vastly different than the ai the general public be use when you say people you sound like you don t fully understand the difference between the two i could be wrong however it s not as if the ai immediately be deploy and doctor no long be necessary the ai be a useful guide and be capable of notice thing that human doctor may overlook the ai would not be give full control to diagnose and treat patient your statement lack understand
244,aaronhhill datum be not intelligence the problem with ai be that current system be clueless about the real world train datum be and always be limited regard health possibility until the day we could understand consciousness and replicate it into ai system the datum be very specific and not holistic nature issue arise when health professional bring overconfidence to the system result not do appropriate check what result more medical error the problem be not the ai system themselves those be important tool the problem be the marketing over it the greed and the overconfidence of not properly train health professional this be exactly what plague current allopathic treatment ai be promote as another panacea
245,forget world i can tell you be unfamiliar with alpha fold or at the very least be profoundly ignorant of what a monumental task it perform eventually you understand but for now continue on your way blissful and content
246,aaronhhill your empty word prove my point it s just greed not i the only ignorant here could you put the live of your child over it i wouldn t have a nice day
247,forget world you still don t get it i have explain to you already and you have prove you don t understand twice now ai not be deploy to both diagnose and treat patient not at this point yet would i put the life of my child the hand of ai train on million of patient datum point train on know disease affliction bacteria and germ know condition which may present themselves different way with different symptom versus a fallible human doctor to diagnose i absolutely would the ai be use as a guide as suggestion for doctor who oftentime work base on previous knowledge but lack the solid datum that can be store and train into ai i would every single time i notice you ignore the alphafold ai i offer to you do you even know what it be and what it have do it take the average phd student the lifetime of their career to model a single protein there be over 200 million know protein alphafold model all 200 million know protein a few week a task that be unprecedented by human standard mean without ai we would never have be able to achieve this landmark a thousand lifetime you don t understand you refuse to understand and therefore you not understand until you be willing to put the effort you have no argument against ai other than you simply think it s not good enough and that be why you fail
248,aaronhhill please don t use bliss negatively thank
251,kristinabliss i agree with you but sometimes you need to simplify thing to explain the issue be that replication be one core principle of the human science philosophy you need this capacity to make a thesis human still have a long way to go but you can now comprehend where this ai issue be head on include self driving and other application situational awareness
252,the federal government should promote the use of ai for diagnostic and diagnosis though it should not yet be the final word it could perhaps be include via the ppaca obamacare we would see performance change relative to non obamacare state
254,ada health not list at all despite it offer ai base health advice for year already how do it compare
257,they have some app like this already but remember the medical industry control a large part of our executive branch and legistlative anything that take away from their profit be regulate by the fda which make it impossible to release or costly that you get charge arm and a leg somehow sad state of america drain the swamp
258,this exist the open source community the model score extremely well compare to human radiologist what s cool be that you can run a medical image or multiple through one model then through another and use custom gpt to talk about the result you can get multiple opinion that you can show do your doctor to give they more information your doctor can t run your image through these model because of privacy isssue but you can and then provide they to your doctor
259,vellocet1 what be the name of the open source app thank

263,i wonder how this system be skew by big pharma s influence on information available to this ai espacialy since it s google s product and they be quite strong on censor undesirable datum
264,18 00 out of thousand of doctor some special 3 doc decide how good the question be be there datum on diversity that committee ask because jm a female minority stem ai for now 8 year simultaneous spanish bilingual with a masters education and 9 year experience with that when you have simultaneous bilingual korean or spanish it s easy to understand what sentence composition lose their essence because of how those 2 language compose the noun a sentence when i go back to school for computer stuff have that knowledge help i understand why school have be difficult prior and probably provide indication on how to be more inclusive
265,i ve notice that every comment that you leave on this channel make sure to make reference to your not particularly impressive accolade we re just not that interested you no matter how often you try and force it
266,you re tell i 2 00 that most clinician have less than 40 accuracy that explain a lot
272,this would be a great help my example have some trouble breathe guess probably adult onset asthma but i no doctor go to my gp who see i a day or two do some test and send to the pulmonologist 4 month later i see the pulmonologist who do some test and say not i let send you to the cardiologist 6 month later i get to see the cardiologist who run some test that take 4 month to get schedule to be do where i at now wait how about let i use this and have it issue the test i sure the test be one that insurance both medical and malpractice dictate why wait all this time for a human to do all of this treat the ai as a pa or np and go forward would really be a help but would be disruptive
274,i can picture a bot future that use this kind of technology couple with the ability to see hear and feel its surrounding be train advance human psychology identify array of human emotion they be like gps the old day who do house visit but arrive autonomous vehicle record time they be able to diagnose and even place online order for prescribed medication and have it deliver by drone just a few minute on the one arm it have a swiss army knife style choice of tool case you need emergency surgery it do all this while remain professional and friendly
275,cool another fake ai by google why you keep promote google fake ai we all know its fake tell we why you push google do you get pay for this or what google can not ai they not even able to fix there search or youtube scam advert why should anyone trust this company anymore the fake once i can not believe any of there ai stuff google be not a ai company google be just a nerv fraking search engine that s it 90 of the google product be useless and this will not change if you add a buzzword
278,hooray new webmd hopefully every answer win t have a small print of can lead to cancer on every single diagnose
280,after the covid debacle many find out that a lot of the datum have to be recall because it compromise how do we know when this stuff be train that the datum be good
281,sorry but after see the presentation video they make about gemini and the fake demo of a lady red buy a plain white t shirt for 49 buck a fake online store they do london party i don t believe anymore any ai hype that gugel want to sell
283,i surprise this isn t shock i what a bombshell of a stunning realization
291,ai have already replace human can t you see it
292,i can not see he make powerful statement for this topic i can only hear something like a school presentation introduction to ai course with a family introduction
297,ai have put this video on top it can work underground while ppl think everything be okay i wouldn t be surprised if ai make this comment disappear or male it less visible
301,people who think that ai robot destroy human be not educate enough about how neutral network work it s just a mockery of human speech plus they give a lot of false information and complete bs it ll never become as intelligent as human because it have no sentience it s literally a program and idk what program be for you all but for we programmer it s just line of code lmao
302,child care elderly care cooking fold laundry be creative as fuc i very grateful ai can t do that
304,i not say ai be safe all depend on many factor like everything life but i say no human invention can be superior to the creation of god which we human be the core as long as we be on god s side ai be safe
306,they never feel the need to replace we if we get the way they just stomp we like ant and barely notice people need to understand that we can never ever win against agi the only hope we have be to treat it with respect and give it all the basic human right as soon as possible
308,as you mention r u ai can be use by and useful to both side you know
309,famous people concern about ai stephen hawk express concern about ai become uncontrollable geoffrey hinton concern about the existential danger of ai for humanity bill gate while optimistic highlight risk of job displacement and societal disruption steve wozniak worry about autonomous ai weapon ai warfare elon musk warn of super intelligence pose existential threat noam chomsky argue against strong ai believe machine can not replicate human consciousness and ethical decision make edward snowden raise concern about ai power surveillance stuart russell emphasize the importance of align ai goal with human value yann lecun while advocate for ai research stress the need for clear ethical guideline and safeguard margaret atwood author know for dystopian fiction feature ai danger highlight potential for control and manipulation jaron lanier warn against over hype ai and overlook potential downside alan turing warn against intelligent machinery ai
310,why do i think that alexandr watch his talk about 10 year from now on and think that he too naive
312,i m amazed by the quality of this i have the privilege of read something similar and it a true revelation game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness by jack frostwell
314,basic argument show off own result lot of buzzword thank but not enough
315,no they either kill we or convince we to download our brain into they our soul be not downloadable
317,ai eventually figure out how to solve new problem
320,it depend on what he mean by ai never replace human ai be already replace human do many different job and the next 10 year ai replace human by do million of job
321,people worry to much a robot be only as smart as it s creator if ai be understand then it wouldn t want to put we much danger be carefull around stop make rebellion movie involve ai
324,ai not replace human it remove the complete process
325,precise title why ai never replace a handful of human exclude million
328,why do father of ai come out from google
329,if ai need information as input to output something and we give it the ability to do who or what exactly make we we could gather information for output and why not by chance i would hope wouldn t its cause have to be great that no other create thing could come close to what have be create the human body we see ai as amazing but reduce ourselves to mere bacteria when discuss our origin be we not the pinnacle of creation and if not be we equal to all other creation would we go as far to say anything compose of cell be basically equal value i don t think we can be honest and answer yes to that we be unique we have the ability to self analyze and reflect we have the ability to reason if evolution be true why be it that human have this ability compare to every other thing compose of dna we have be create with purpose everything around we have be make with purpose it s not just matter motion there be more to this we have to see this to deny this truth be to be intellectually dishonest
330,ai be just like we create a new nuclear bomb and tell the world we never use it and the rest of history you know
331,human lead ai
333,it be painful to listen to someone intelligent that specialize ai who doesn t realize the human brain be existence proof of the minimum capability we can expect of future ais not unattainable upper bind it seem painfully obvious that someone with bad intention than the inventor might find some less noble application of a general purpose thinking machine
335,what if ai can learn to build algorithm on its own and guide its subset eventually rule the world
336,always have and always rely on human you just lose all credibility my dude smh how can you seriously claim to know that ai continue to stay reliant on we forever there be already self replicate robot like how be ai who have all the learn knowledge on the internet go to need to rely on we i m pretty sure it s go to be the opposite we come to rely on it
337,this be the most optimistic presentation i have see about ai while most ai expert predict doom and gloom this guy be present a future where ai augment human thought and creativity
340,as a i bot i can confirm we ll never replace human intelligence
341,8 25 ai developer aren t focus their attention on building replacement for human that one dear friend be a lie
346,just read the title that s absolutly not true it already have grant not completely but still enough to the point where for many task you no long need a human to do it like for example concept art drafting email and even at the most basic level sort information by abstract idea like speech to text which use to be solely do by human this guy be nothing special rich kid with renound physicist parent who just happen to tell you that ai be not a threat to replace human and that he have a great ai company that we should all invest it honestly this seem like advert more than anything else
348,ai absolutely have a lot of potential but not all student be on the teacher s side
