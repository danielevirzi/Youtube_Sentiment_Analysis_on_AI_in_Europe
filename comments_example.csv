0,Bruh he really looked like thanos
1,"He averaged 35,9,9 on 54% in these playoffs.... absolutely unreal"
2,"Idc what anyone says, 1 superstar should not be beating 5 good players, and a great coach in a 7 games series, That’s some unprecedented stuff right there."
3,"Nobody in NBA history is better than this version of LeBron, absolutely unstoppable."
4,The fact that LeBron took this Cavs team to 4 straight finals is just amazing.
5,"To the people that see this in the future, this MAN had one of the GREATEST playoff runs of all time"
6,Tatum:*posterizes LeBron*
7,LeBron: so you have chosen DEATH
8,"I remember clearly the post game celebration in this game. Everyone holding the trophy and opening champagnes. Then there is Lebron in the corner. Gassed, exhausted. Has ice cubes over his body and feet. It was heart wrenching to see. He can barely celebrate the win."
9,Best and 1 play of all time at 2:15. Morris was literally trying to pull him to the ground. Legendary celebration too.
10,2018 bron easily the best player I’ve ever seen
11,Can't wait to tell my kids that they've put 5 all-star in a team  just to beat a 1 man
12,"I’m back in 2021 after watching Nets vs Harden. What LeBron done this playoffs will get appreciated 5-10 years from now. Played all minutes, he went to first round game 7 and still managed to carry the team. Look at KD and Giannis how they were gassed from going to second round game 7 after sweeping the first round. One of a kind"
13,This dude has had like 3 primes lol. 2013 he was a monster but 2018 he was literally a basketball god
14,Greatest playoff run by a player and he dropped 51 in a finals game and still couldn’t win. shame that most have forgotten about this but I never will. FIFTY ONE IN A FINALS GAME 
15,The fact that lebron carried this team to the finals is ridiculous
16,"Ladies and gentlemen, the GOAT"
17,"2:21 when The King roars, the whole world hears it"
18,bro roaring like a lion.. I cried when I saw that live.. he the goat man forreal
19,LeBron roaring and scaring the entire baseline.
20,2:25 The Celtics fans reactions are priceless
21,"That’s Lebron’s most iconic photo. Just epic powerful, all around dope pic"
22,"2:16 Man, I've rewatched this play an ungodly number of times in the last 5 years and it still gives me chills!"
23,2018 LeBron was a basketball god. Yikes!
24,2018 playoff run is what made me FINALLY cast my vote for greatest player of all time.
25,"James is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers.   That pass he made to George Hill was brilliant.  Everyone else in the building figured, with a five point lead, that they would milk the clock.  Instead, James, after the defensive rebound by Green, immediately throws a 50 foot assist to ice the game."
26,"I wished, LeBron would've won it all that year, he should've won mvp"
27,2:25 i love this womensupporting LBJ
28,"jesus that last play was simply incredible. literally getting pulled back, brown goaltended, and the basket still counts. literally unstoppable"
29,I love when you can hear him roaring after the and 1 and can see all the fans just looking in disbelief those celtics fans always been the biggest haters he crushed their hopes
30,But still people doesn't give him the respect he deserves and only talking about his lost finals...
31,Bro that whole sequence starting at 2:16 will always be historical. Still give me goosebumps. If you pay attention when he taunts the crowd after the play you can pause the video and see alot of mad faces in the crowd.
32,this is LeBron at his absolute best. He was unstoppable during this playoff run
33,"As a Celtics fan, I knew we were done for after Game 6. LeBron wasn't going to lose in the ECF on his own floor, and everyone knows you don't mess with Game 7 LeBron"
34,2018 bron is the best player i've ever seen
35,I'm a Bucks Fan and I just had to comeback here after today's game to truly appreciate Lebron's Greatness. He made it look easy. That's why he's undisputedly Top 2 All Time.
36,"Let's do some math. 200lbs Jordan couldn't handle the physicality of the Pistons. Jordan works out, comes back 205, 210? Now that's enough weight/size/strength to deal with what the Pistons were doing. Now, look at 6'9"" 265lbs Bron scoring an and 1 with a man around the same size literally grabbing his shoulders with all his weight like its nothing. Why do ppl say, ""Bron couldn't deal with the physicality of the 80s."" Be honest, you think the players in the 80s want an elbow from Bron? If they hit, he can hit back. They'd learn pretty quick that this guy is a bit bigger and stronger than the rest. Jordan at 210 was strong enough, but somehow Karl Malone sized Bron couldn't deal?"

38,Lebrun would have 10 rings if he played in 1969 like bill russell lol
39,from 2011 until now the celtics have not seen finals thanks to LeThanos
40,Wow. The emotion after Brons and 1 gave me goosebumps... I'm really missing basketball
41,Morris pulling lebron down while brown comes in trying to block the shot as the ball goes up and in regardless is such a beautiful encapsulation of how unstoppable lebron has been for most of his career.
42,"The crazy thing is that haters use this year to bash his legacy. They say he got swept in the finals, and how Jordan never lost a finals. I dont care what anybody says, MJ aint taking this team to the finals let alone winning against that golden state team. Lebron the GOAT for literally carrying this awful team"
43,To this day I still can’t believe lebron was able to even get the shot off let alone not fall to ground at the sequence from 2:15-2:21 Marcus Morris literally tried to tackle him down and he needed up flying into the cameramen and lebron stood his ground all while playing all 48 minutes and last minute of the game unreal ️
44,Morris put all his strength on his back and Lebron still made the and 1.
45,When LeBron roared .. i felt that
46,"1:50 That gutsy pass over 3 people in a tight game that could have resulted in a turnover is a great reminder of how far he's come in developing his game. He's already passed Magic Johnson at that point, would have been interesting to see him get pushed to the limit like this again to see how far he'll go"
47,"Every guy in there has beaten a thousand others in high school and college to get to the NBA, yet there is one person in there who makes all of them look like children. Absolutely unbelievable."
48,I’ll never forget watching this game 7 in the madison square garden beer garden. Insane vibes
49,"2:55 even with a flagrant foul and a goaltend, he still makes that layup. Incredible."
50,man 2018 playoffs bron was my favorite idc that he got swept in the finals the way he got there was just insane especially that toronto series mans just completely destroyed them
51,"Even the Cavs didn't win the Title, we all know who was MVP that post season."
52,His second leading scorer was Jeff Green. 
53,He played 48 minutes.

55,"If this 2018 LeBron won a title that year, he would have recorded the single greatest postseason run in NBA history and nobody would have a chance at touching it."
56,"I was live watching this game i cant believe what i saw he was just  so amazing,even though he lost to the finals , he became the greatest player in my eyes"
57,"I grew up in the 1970s and 80s. I saw all the greats of that era play week after week and none of them were as good as Lebron. His court IQ, his court vision, his size, his skills, his shooting. The best players of that era would have an near impossible time guarding him."
58,4 years later unbelievable still 
59,So in Skip Beiles mindset he should loose this game in order to avoid the upcoming finals lost. Give me a break! LeGOAT
60,2018 LeBron has to be the greatest single man playoff run of all time
61,One of 4 primes he is coming into another era of his greatness
62,"LeBron was unquestionably the most dominant basketball player in the world for ten straight years, so much so that it's hard to even nail down when his peak even was."
63,This was his greatest achievement besides that comeback from 3-1 deficit of '16 Finals 
64,I hope clippers team will watch all game 7 that lebron played. I mean not to do what lbj does but how to play with these situations. He was dominant in this situations. Doesnt choke with this. 
65,His game 7 average :
66,34.9 points

68,If it’s a game 7 and lebron is in it. I would put money on the team he’s playing for every time.
69,For what he's getting right now. Well deserved King. This team was so bad bruh . No one could've carried this team other than that man
70,they say heat bron was the best version..but this 2018 guy was so damn special beast
71,Celtics never be the same since then
72,"""And after the work done by LeBron. The appreciation from the bench."

75,Anyone came back to watch this after Nets got swapped by Celtics 2022?
76,Scariest thing about LEBRoN (Game 7)
77,Look at the fans faces in the crowd after the and 1. Total awe and defeat.
78,Morris literally said:
79,"""Take me with ya' Bron"""
80,"Here after kd, kyrie got swept "
81,He had that crowd so quiet
82,April 2021 and I’m still getting goosebumps watching Bron carrying the Cavs on his back. Bron is a beast. He is the goat  no doubt.
83,"Carrying Jeff Green, George Hill, JR Smith, and Tristan Thompson down the stretch to the finals "
84,"it’s actually insane to think that lebron would go into every playoff game that year and didn’t know who the hell was gonna help him let alone score more than 10pts, fuckin insaneee"
85,Lebron in the cavs uniform got most energy and will power that i’ve ever seen
86,Greatest Playoff run ever by the Greatest Player Ever ️
87,This was one of the best series I’ve ever watched
88,"he’s the GOAT, straight up. i’m blessed to have witnessed all that he’s done, and i’m grateful for how inspiring he’s been for me whenever he plays basketball. Thank you LeThanos "
89,When people always bring up Jayson Tatum dunking on LeBron I just think about this game and the outcome.
90,I love how you can hear this man’s Roar over the crowd. He was on his king shit
91,I doubt if MJ could do it like the King
92,"""He'll never have a greater achievement than getting this [2018] team to the Finals."" Um, how about that 2007 Cavaliers team? That team had no business being in the Finals that year."
93,The greatest of all time !!! Jordan great but the way this man carries teams just incredible!!!!
94,The best version of Lebron. No player in NBA is better than 2018 Bron
95,"2:15 is honestly ridiculous. He sprints past everyone, wears Morris like a backpack and Brown hits it off the backboard and it still goes in. Then you can just hear the Boston fans collectively gasping in disbelief, and he lets out a primal, guttural roar as the Celtics have been LeBron'd yet again. Mark Jackson missed a golden opportunity to say ""puts his team on his back, as well as Morris"". At this time, I thought this dude was an actual superhero."

97,"“he’ll never have a better achievement “ , fast forward to 2023 & he just became the all time scoring leader"
98,4:01 those words still haunt me as a cavs fan
99,"I still believe this is the best ever individual Playoff performance ever given by a player... Iverson's 2001, Dirk's 2011 and Jordan's 1991 runs are also there in the Top 5... But Man, Lebron was doing it all - defense, assists, rebounds.. JR Smith ruined it in Game 1, but if Lebron got that pass, considering his buzzer beaters vs. Toronto and Pacers in this playoffs - Lebron would easily get a 50 pt. Game 1 win, and he may lose that series but we will still be happy that he won 1 game against the Warriors Juggernaut of 5 prime all-stars, 2 of them MVP level, on one team (Durant, Curry, Klay, Green, Iggy)"

101,the sequence from 2:15-2:30 straight beast mode played literally all game 7 after already putting up the greatest individual playoff run ever with a supporting cast that should not have been past the 1st round that year va the pacers of not for Lebron Heroics One of a Kind    
102,Here after nets down 0-3 from this boston lmao
103,This was probably the most nervous I’ve ever been watching lebron in a elimination game. Because other then lebron you had no idea who was gonna step up. Jeff green stepped up and had some crucial plays
104,"lebron was always dominating every year.. but in 2018, he just became the basketball god"
105,1:48 I love that from George Hill. He understands the game isn’t over yet and the Celtics are lagging getting back so he just runs the floor for any easy bucket. That’s why you have veteran players like that
106,I will never forget the greatness
107,He's not a great Free Throw shooter but came up big when they were needed. He used his court vision to find George Hill with a full court pass to get Hill an easy layup. He uses his athleticism to run full court for a layup and draws a flagrant foul from the Morris twin who called himself the LeBron stopper. Let's not forget that Kyrie was no longer a Cavalier here. Kevin Love only played 160 minutes in this series. There are levels to greatness here. Van Gundy tops it off with the perfect words on commentary.

109,him roaring after that and one gives me chills
110,Sadly everyone will remember only the fact LeBron got swept in the finals. (and perhaps the JR mistake)
111,"While this celtics was young, it was well coached and for one man to basically beat them single handedly is one of the greatest achievements in the history of the league. If only GSW wasn’t so stacked, he’d have the most iconic playoff run of all time."
112,I seriously hope jimmy burler has this performance tonights game
113,The greatest achievement ever was to take this team to the finals. He took not a bad not a mediocre but a basement team to the finals.  Any other great player wouldn’t even take this team to the playoffs.
114,Even as a Celtics fan you just have to applaud his greatness
115,WHOS HERE AFTER BOSTON GO THE FINALS!!
116,2 Years Ago LeBron play all 48 Minutes he is record without resting
117,Like how he shrugs off fouls on his shoulder to score it's amazing... Greatness
118,"2:17 Morris jumped and grabbed Lebron, he still made the basket. Incredible we'll miss this guy at the end of his career."
119,"4:50 Jeff Van Gundy stating FACTS. Most people don't realize/remember it, but the Cavs were not supposed to be in the Finals that year. LeBron literally carried them through the East as a 4 seed! And then he had to go up against 4 All-Stars in the Finals and somehow we're surprised that they got swept smh give this man his respect"
120,2:25 the best play I’ve ever witnessed no cap
121,This man deserved a 5th ring
122,"2:17 Lmao, Marcus Morris tried to grab lebron so he cant shoot and brown tried to block, but lebron still got and1"

Greatnes at his best!
155,Lebrons 2018 run to the finals made him a GOAT in my eyes!
156,Legendary performance

165,I went from being the happiest guy to the most depressed guy in just 7 minutes 
166,How do you go from postering LeBron and taking the lead to giving the ball to Jeff Green and JR Smith?

174,Even Jeff Van Gundy was talking about just how special it was getting the Cavs to the finals
175,2:23 where Lebron spots the only Cavs fan and roars straight towards her!!! Must have been a surreal moment for her LMAO
176,This the LeBron we needed in game 6 vs the suns  how times have changed my boy getting older 
177,Mannnn if lebron won that year in the finals. IT WOULDVE TOPPED THAT 3-1 comeback from 2016

183,As a season ticket holder vet for those 4 years LBJ run were special for my wife and I memories we never forget
184,"There's this tweet that said people didn't know what they witnessed in 2018 with LeBron. And it's so true. The whole playoffs he was, for a time, the greatest to ever dribble a basketball. I ain't saying he's the GOAT though, if you're stupid enough to misinterpret what I'm saying."
185,A true KING will never leave his KINGDOM 
186,Jeff green with Lebron= finals 
187,Jeff green with Kd= 2nd round Exit
188,Who here after nets got swept? had to see how the job gets done 
189,He dragged them to the finals he is the goat
190,How can you not appreciate this chosen one?

196,"mad respect for this '18 bron. carried this team all the way to the finals, without any other prime superstars. doesn't matter if his number 1 nor 2 and 3 player of all time, so much respect."
197,"Imagine being held by a 6foot10 dude and instead of him holding you down, you take him up with you. Unreal body strength"
198,"Mama, there goes that man"
199,"I'm lucky I've been here since LBJ playing at St Mary's til now. I've watched every moment of LBJ career from pass first to all time scoring title, not to mention he took the Cavs to the finals at age 22 he lost but it created this Player we are fortunate to watch while we can."

205,"From 2004-2010, LeBron was this agile, explosive freak of nature. His sheer athleticism alone combined with his IQ was enough to take over games. "
206,"In 2011-2018, we witnessed a bulked-up James who lost a tad of that speed and jump but doubled that power to ascend his defensive prowess to new heights, being able to guard the 1-5 and play the 1-5, it was his versatility peak. "

From the incredible Game 7 he had in 08 to a winning performance this time som  10 years later, along with every other playoff duel they’ve had the years in-between. I look forward to seeing a documentary about this rivalry some day"
210,I'll never understand people who discredit him for getting to the Finals and not winning. Look at the journey
211,"We’ve come alonggggg way from this. Glad al Tatum brown and smart now get a chance at redemption, a chance to finally make the finals after years of heartbreaks. Go Celtics !"
212,Bron sent that weak ass roster to the finals 
213,"Then Lebron goes on to drop 50 points in Game 1 of the NBA Finals vs a Warriors team with Curry, Durant, &Thompson. Only for it to be ruined by George Hill missing a free throw and JR Smith forgetting the score"
214,Lebron was so good that playoffs he shouldve won fmvp even though he lost
215,2:15 loook at lebrons speeeeed bro!!!!
216,"Lebron with not much help, gets his team to the Finals.   Steph with not much help, loses 2 play-in games."
217,"Lebron plays 48 minutes, yet he can still fly with Morris on his back. Unreal"
218,YO MORRIS PUTTING ALL HIS LIFE ENERGY ON THAT FOUL ON LEBRON
219,Look at the PIPS saying thank you Glady -Mark Jackson  I love his commentary. I honestly believe it's why the haven't gave him another chance to coach. They blocking him. His commentary is classic and entertaining. Good for the NBA.
220,"One of my favorite lebron plays all time. Idc they didn’t win that year, that was greatest performance of any nba player all time"
221,"3:01 LeBron is so good, that even when they goaltend his layup, it still goes in haha"
222,When LeBron roars at the baseline the bald camera man is scared for his life!
223,2:20 he had to let that roar out and the fans were left speechless.
224,Recommended to me after the Clippers losing to the Nuggets in Game 7.
225,"I have probably watched the And-1 Goaltend + Celebration Roar at least 1,000 times"
226,Funny how people try to downplay him saying he beat a young team but that same young team beat Embiid and Giannis stfu
227,2:15 That’s a grown man in Marcus Morris trying to stop him from getting to the bucket
228,it always makes me a day when watching bron roaring and the baseline getting silent
229,I remember in the middle of the regular season nobody thought the cavs was even making the playoffs how terrible they were. Bron literally carried the team the whole year. That year aged him
230,"Counted, goaltend,and 1"
231,Amazing
232,Need this performance from Jimmy tonight
233,he taken the 2007 cavs and the 2017 cavs to the finals without an allstar player.
234,2:43 why does Lebron remind me of thanos
235,"And it all went to the drain because of one play down the strech in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, Thanks JR."
236,I’m here after watching Tatums inspirational game 6.. Good to see him grow into a more mature elite basketball player

241,Lol the faces of the ppl in the audience when lebron roars...priceless lol
242,Jordan would’ve never made that pass
243,3:50 HOF Intimidator Badge
244,The fact that this Celtic team got this far and nearly got to the finals with a rookie Tatum. A second year brown. And no kyrie. That’s pretty crazy. Lebron is just a whole other human being
245,“Next level basketball” -Kevin Durant on Bron’s playoff performance in 2018.
246,I never cared for Lebron that much but god damn 2018 was something else. You could feel his back breaking from all the load he had to heave to the finals.
247,2:17 this scene always gives me goosebumps... Imagine a 6'9 260 pound dude running and almost carrying a whole dude in this shoulders.. man LaBron is a strong MOTHUFUCKA...
248,"insane run in 2018 , the fact that he got this team to the finals is fucking astonishing !!"
