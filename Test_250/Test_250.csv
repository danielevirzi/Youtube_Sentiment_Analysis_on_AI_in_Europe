It's a threat like the Internet was, and we'll handle it with the same aplomb.  We lack the economic resources to keep third spaces open to meet people, so we'll use AI, VR and other fancy tech to make virtual third spaces and we'll date that way, like some people did in online games, then we'll meet in person.  Sure, we'll be manipulated by advertisers even more effectively than ever, but it's not functionally any different then now in the end since most people are already easily manipulated.  I remember warning of the dangers of social media when I was just a teen and I saw what smart phones and social media did to people, and the damage is now done.  The only way to go back is to go forward now, we need to fix what we broke because we're now dependent on digital tech, like it or not.  This will mean new challenges, new risks, and it's all an adventure we're going to discover together for better and for worse as it will be both as always with these things.

2024-04-16T19:58:08Z,@AsrmsJahangir,eXdVDhOGqoE,"Your detailed discourse on the impact of AI on society and the environment is comprehensive and addresses many critical issues. However, there are a few areas where the argument could benefit from clarification or further substantiation to avoid potential logical fallacies or ambiguities. Here are some observations and suggestions for refining the argument:\n\n1. **Appeal to Authority and Anecdotal Evidence**:\n   - In your argument, you mention AI incidents and your experiences (e.g., the chatbot advising a divorce, AI creating inappropriate images, etc.) as evidence of broader issues within AI technology. While these examples are compelling, they could be seen as anecdotal evidence. Anecdotal evidence can be persuasive but may not always represent the norm or provide a statistically significant basis for general conclusions.\n   - **Suggestion**: Strengthen the argument by including more systematic data or research findings that reflect broader trends in AI\'s impact on society and its potential risks.\n\n2. **Overgeneralization**:\n   - You mention various negative impacts of AI like discrimination, copyright infringement, and environmental damage. However, there\'s a risk of overgeneralization if these issues are presented as pervasive without acknowledging variations in AI application and management across different contexts and organizations.\n   - **Suggestion**: Specify that these issues can occur but are not inevitable in all AI applications, emphasizing the importance of context and management practices in mitigating such risks.\n\n3. **False Dichotomy**:\n   - The argument juxtaposes focusing on AI\'s future existential risks with addressing its current tangible impacts, suggesting that one necessarily detracts from the other. This presents a false dichotomy as both aspects can be important and attention to one does not necessarily preclude attention to the other.\n   - **Suggestion**: Clarify that it\'s possible and beneficial to address both immediate and long-term concerns simultaneously, rather than framing it as an either/or choice.\n\n4. **Hasty Generalization**:\n   - The conclusion drawn from the personal anecdote about the email claiming AI will end humanity might be considered a hasty generalization if it suggests that all concerns about AI‚Äôs existential risk are distractions based on one extreme viewpoint.\n   - **Suggestion**: Acknowledge that while some fears about AI may be exaggerated, there is a legitimate discourse about both its immediate and potential long-term effects, and both deserve thoughtful consideration.\n\n5. **Ambiguity**:\n   - Some terms and concepts (e.g., ""singularity"", ""existential risk"") are used without clear definitions, which could lead to ambiguity in understanding the full scope of your argument.\n   - **Suggestion**: Define key terms more explicitly to ensure clarity and enhance the argument\'s effectiveness.\n\nBy addressing these areas, your argument about the impacts of AI and the importance of responsible management could be more robust and persuasive, avoiding potential logical pitfalls while fostering a more nuanced discussion about the challenges and opportunities presented by AI technologies.",2024-04-16T19:58:08Z

Machines can't do that, have _never_ been able to do that, and never _will_ do that. Why? Because that requires sentience and for something to be sentient there needs to be an element beyond the physical machinery, a non-corporeal entity.

This sets the stage for a discussion about the perception and reality of AI's dangers.
  
- Luccioni acknowledges the widespread fascination with AI, ranging from its positive contributions like medical discoveries to its darker implications such as harmful chatbot interactions and biased AI meal planner suggestions.

- The talk moves beyond speculative doomsday scenarios to focus on the present-day impacts of AI on society and the environment. Luccioni points out that AI is not isolated but interconnected with societal structures, leading to issues such as contributing to climate change, using data without consent, and perpetuating biases.

- A major concern highlighted is the environmental cost of AI, particularly the significant energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with training large language models like Bloom. She stresses the importance of measuring and disclosing these environmental impacts and advocates for sustainability in AI development and deployment.

- Additionally, Luccioni discusses issues of consent in data usage for AI training, citing examples of artists and authors whose work has been used without permission. She emphasizes the need for tools like ""Have I Been Trained?"" to provide transparency and accountability in data usage for AI training.

- The talk also addresses biases inherent in AI systems, especially concerning race and gender. Luccioni shares examples of biased facial recognition systems and biased image generation models and introduces tools like the Stable Bias Explorer to help understand and mitigate biases in AI.

- Overall, Luccioni concludes by advocating for collective action to address the current impacts of AI, stressing the importance of transparency, accessibility, and accountability in AI development and deployment. She emphasizes the need for informed choices, legislation, and governance to ensure that AI benefits society while minimizing its negative impacts.",2024-03-22T02:28:36Z
2024-03-22T02:30:43Z,@mikahundin,eXdVDhOGqoE,"According to the speaker, Sasha Luccioni, AI is dangerous not solely due to future existential risks but because of its current tangible impacts on society and the environment. She emphasizes several reasons why AI is currently dangerous:

1. **Environmental Impact**: AI models, particularly large language models, consume vast amounts of energy and emit significant carbon dioxide during training. This contributes to climate change and environmental degradation.

2. **Data Usage Without Consent**: AI often uses data, including art and books, without the consent of the creators. This raises ethical concerns regarding intellectual property rights and fairness.

3. **Bias and Discrimination**: AI systems can perpetuate biases present in their training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes, especially against marginalized communities. This bias can manifest in various applications, such as facial recognition systems and image generation models.

4. **Privacy Concerns**: AI-powered systems collect and analyze large amounts of personal data, potentially infringing on individuals' privacy rights and leading to surveillance concerns.

5. **Automation and Job Displacement**: AI's automation capabilities have the potential to displace jobs and disrupt entire industries, leading to economic challenges and social inequalities.

Overall, Luccioni argues that focusing solely on future existential risks detracts from addressing the current tangible impacts of AI. She advocates for increased transparency, accountability, and the development of tools to measure and mitigate these impacts to ensure that AI technology is deployed responsibly.",2024-03-22T02:30:43Z

even if you make an AI that can be renforced with the result of its actions constantly just to clean, if it is big enough, it will maximize its chance or keep existing so that it can keep incrementing the amount of cleaned things.

Any goal but autodestruction implies existing. Any neural network big enough will behave in ways that increment their chance to exist, the better the network, the harder to avoid it and to control it.

Just like you and I have emergent behaviours called love, fear, anger, happiness, confusion, ... that condition our outputs to continue trying to live, survive and multiply.

Sasha Luccioni, an AI ethics researcher, steps onto the TED stage to remind us that while AI might not be gearing up to terminate humanity a la Terminator, it's still not exactly the trustworthy robot friend we might hope for.

Luccioni brings us back down to Earth (pun intended) by pointing out some very real and current concerns about AI. Forget about sci-fi scenarios of AI overlords; let's talk about the here and now. She dives into the environmental impact, highlighting how AI's insatiable hunger for data and computing power can leave quite the carbon footprint. It's like realising your friendly AI assistant might be secretly a carbon-spewing factory in disguise.

But wait, there's more! Luccioni also shines a light on AI's less-than-stellar track record when it comes to copyright infringement. Picture AI as that kid in school who always copied someone else's homework but with the potential for much bigger consequences. From music to art to literature, AI's ability to churn out ""original"" works raises some serious questions about intellectual property.

And let's not forget the delightful world of biased information. Luccioni doesn't hold back in pointing out how AI, with its algorithms and data sets, can unwittingly perpetuate and even amplify biases. It's like giving your well-meaning but slightly clueless friend the keys to the internet and hoping they won't mess things up too badly.

But fear not, for Luccioni doesn't just leave us in a pit of AI-induced despair. She offers a glimmer of hope with practical solutions. Regulations, transparency, inclusivity‚Äîthese are the tools she presents to navigate our AI-filled future with a bit more confidence.

So, here's to Sasha Luccioni, the voice of reason in the cacophony of AI hype. May her words serve as a wake-up call to the very real challenges we face in this AI-driven world. Let's regulate, let's be transparent, and let's ensure that our AI companions of the future are more Wall-E than Skynet. After all, it's not about fearing the robot apocalypse‚Äîit's about making sure we're the ones in control of the machines, not the other way around.

This assumes a baseline of google query vs GPT 4.x LLM query.   We do need mire efficient ways to train AI, but AI has already come up with a new algorithm that dramatically reduces the cost/carbon impact of the highest non-AI use case: search/sort routines.

Also, the current 10-fold increase in price/performance per year, coupled with the fact that ‚Äúwe have no moat, and either does Open AI‚Äù, means soon any kid in their bedroom, bad actor, small team from an adversarial country can engineer some thing far beyond today‚Äôs AI for 1/thousandth to 1/millionth the cost.

Be aware that both the current technology used, for example, for wind energy and solar panels or not actually sustainable, and the term 'renewable' is regularly used to make it sound better (it's actually a bit of a scam). For example, to the uninformed crowd, a solar panel appears to us as less damaging to the environment, but for various reasons that have to do with the raw materials, the life-span, and what happens after its life-span, solar panels should not be called sustainable, or even renewable. We have not yet been able to exploit any kind of energy source in a truly safe, renewable, and sustainable way, even though some technologies are not directly emitting carbon themselves once they are functioning.

Are we are not clever enough to invent a way to provide energy without destroying the planet? Do we need AI to invent it for us? No, we don't nee IA for that! We are perfectly capable of inventing it ourselves. But to invent it, we need the right environment, incentive, and (financial) freedom, all of which are not available within our current culture, economy, and financial system. In other words, we need to evolve away from the ego-driven competition-society we are currently maintaining for no other reason than that the ones who profit from it, are also the ones who decide for us. We need to learn how to work together, and that means we need to evolve and break free from certain restrictions of a paradigm that is falling apart, and focus on what is really important.",2024-02-10T14:38:21Z

2024-01-21T12:24:11Z,@jimstartup2729,eXdVDhOGqoE,"AI is a tool that allows people that have little capability or understanding to perform tasks they are cognitively incapable of understanding. That goes for consequences. The scope for social modelling, influence and control is truly scary. If Facebook and Twitter can influence elections sufficiently already, then throwing AI into the mix at the hands of people with malign interests literally tells us this is practically the end of democracy and possibly the dawn if absolute chaos. The sheer scope of information AI can process and draw ""simple to understand"" conclusions from alone makes it hugely troublesome in a world that alread has a runaway problem of content control. These things are already processes we can no longer fully manage correctly as the scope is beyond human comprehension. If only people would be more reserved on this but.. people want to make money and are pushing it like a gold rush. Humanity on a global level is at severe risk here if not only based on the risk to  our very global information base (the internet) being corrupted at a level we wont comprehend. All this at the hands of someone that in the end just needs to have an idea to be able to create things previously unattainable. its just too much power too fast for too many people for this not to be a disaster.",2024-01-21T12:24:11Z

Human beings define reality in relation to the universe and eachother.

We need a new exhaust system added to AI . Remember you pay your electricity bills and AI cant work without it. And can you imagine. We have gormless politicians forcing us to adopt to using eectric cars which use power in their computing systems their diesel models dont have.
