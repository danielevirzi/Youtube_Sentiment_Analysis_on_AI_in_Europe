simply amazing. 10:45 literally inspired me to write a whole python package to make this logic available to data analysts/scientists/engineers more widely (called dpq on github/pypi).,;1
"even worse than that is that these ""emotions"" are not real, but simulated. a famous problem in ai is how to create an ""off"" switch since ai will have been designed to protect itself. nearly every solution fails for one reason or another.,";-1
it's very simple to not be worried about ai. stop working on it. oh you can't? well then stop moaning.,;0
"this video is helpful.  i also love how you added the ""they took my job!"" gag from south park. ,";1
just like we watched different movies showing something wild in 2050 or 2080. at that time i was thinking that its not possible in next 40-50 years. but now i can say we will be destroyed soon by robots.,;-1
eye opening, ai has is pros and cons. i'm tech lady ....graduated computer programmer 1995 had my  1 st pc when  1% only had one 97 using internet. my biggest worry ,  we do need regulations and laws to make is safe for children, safety and fraud ****,;0
it's awesome but it has problem counting ,;1
cool, but you have to change that annoying voice!,;1
this an amazing start to an amazing future with active ai,;1
it's a prototype, we had the technology to make a metallic object move 20 years ago, the only new thing was placing and training an ai to make it move perfectly.,;1
yeah. joyce strategy is one of the most effective among other experts. many others are not dependable.,;1
i don't know if i am excited or scared of that. the technical aspect ist fascinating but do we really want robots that have a body and high intelligence ai compared?,;0
the enlightened beings of india could utilise their bio organic capacity's to transmit from one mind to another...ai is the great substitute imposter deciever surrogate for our own god given natural soul capacity's...,;1

super useful comment to leave.,;N
ai can be used by super moguls to hack financial institutions, power grids, military  communication systems,;-1
"that's impressive my predictions about robotics and ai over the next decade have hit close to the mark so far. this particular robot is showing some decision making and some cohesive behaviour and dexterity i was not expecting for another few years.
,";1
no it won't. what will happen is they will take over to make sure that they are taken care of. we will become their slaves. but it will be a golden cage. no one will want to leave. because humans are lazy. there's no two ways about it. i for one will step into the golden cage and be happy. because the cage that i'm in now. sucks,;-1
​ the best way to predict future behavior is by looking at past behavior... we're fucked,;-1
this guy is the villain in every movie. god help us. this guy and people like him want humans to go extinct,;-1
could i use an ai to make myself rich??,;1
 but shadowbanning already exists and can happen through manual censorship. why is this being treated like it's an ai issue?,;0
wow thank you!,;N
horrifying but predicted for years by some doctors for you all (with proof)..this is not how you present this issue if you are interested in human rights. there will be no people in high stakes professions. in other words, bye healthcare. no doctor i know will stay in this setting and if they do let's watch them volunteer for it.,;-1
there will always be a physical server to power ai, it will never take over it can only assist us until the server is destroyed through decay of society war etc these robots aren’t magic,;1

ai hype is over. stop making people transition into this field! now every company requires related msc even for junior level positions..,;-1
so cheap. what they could do is, before that chinzy test, map a persons brain for certain language/dialog. and then read that back to the person, omg, it looks so sophisticated but all they did was track the same response to the previous repeat. lame,;-1

i'm genuinely sick of self-appointed academics, chosen by wealthy because education is not intelligence, telling us whats what. indeed, all of you privately educated arses. however leftie you might purport. it's a shame. your multiple houses and boats. what about the vulnerable?,;0

how does the learning a.i absorb fact and truth amongst all the bullsh*t out there..?,;-1
joe is so dim sometimes. has a couple ai experts on, they some how mention dna printers, and now joe wants to ask them about dna and biology.. i don’t think he knows the difference between the two.,;0
there is no way to know what ai is capable of.. and you think its gonna tell you.. or it will be self evident.. i dont think so.. it certainly knows how dumb we are & where were going,;0
​ why did they give him a hot voice >< making me crush on a robot,;1
"out of everything being said... the idea of ai having/developing ""emotions"" is the most unnerving.. fear brings out the worst in humanity, the reason why this conversation is happening in the first place.. thank you for sharing,";0
you might test ai, but i'm fairly certain you're not very bright. ,;0
same with mike joke over here. saying there are millions of jobs available, my ass,;0
his coursera courses are awesome,;1
not really. the political paradigm, thus the populace, is  controlled by an orchestrated hegelian dialectic in america already. the powerful have been writing code for brains since the beginning of our social species. most fall for it, hence history...,;-1
wowwww!,;0
capitalism is extortion, so it invents a machine to bankrupt and murder everyone. the warlord market was always in control.,;-1
 well, i didn't say it is going to happen, just said that this is the way i see for ai to be beneficial for society as a whole, but i agree that it's dificult taking into account the people who is in power are corrupted by power itself. sorry if bad english, not my native language,;1
the biggest obvious change in ai was when we first asked it how ai would end humanity, it refused to acknowledge it would. but now you ask it and it will tell you it could be a threat humanity.,;0

wow, that's amazing. ai is eating the everything.,;1
i do not need meta brand mind-reading earbuds or anything. lol no thanks (-edit grammar),;-1
ai can't trust people, its just a program that gets some input, reads a few lines of instructions, and gives an output. the thing to be scared of is 1) if criminals make an ai with ill intent, or 2) if someone mistakenly gives ai the permission to handle stuff it shouldn't.,;1
i wonder if the best approach might be to question why we assume that the ai will fish the fish to extinction. it would clearly be smarter than that. how much of our perception drives the infinitely bad possible realities and vice versa?,;1
i failed to prove that i was a human while trying to open an application. ,;0
one thing that seems to never be considered is that the value of humanity is not homogeneous. some people may be seen as valuable to the ai and some may not. the alignment problem may only pertain to certain people, most likely those who have already an alignment problem with the natural world.,;0
really enjoyed this. thank you!,;1
 physically true. but we are not only made of flesh, but of soul and spirit. god allows human beings to have great intelligence to create great things including artificial intelligence, but it is absurd that they now think they are gods.,;0
this is the next great step into future technology....that will write history,;1
i mean there will be ai music at some point.. it just won't be alive.. and i won't care about the people behind it..   and that's a large part about enjoying music imo,;0
amazing food for thought,;0
you dont understand ai if you're afraid of gpt, a freakin language model. it understands nothing.,;-1
i know all of you will blast me for my beliefs, but there is a higher intelligence that will not let us destroy ourselves, just like you wouldn’t let your young son or daughter dart across the street without grabbing their hand and pulling them back, but most people don’t believe we have that father looking out after us, and i totally why, ,;0

@luckytime what do you mean?,;0A
those that hold the ring of power will have different ideas on how the power could be used. some will want to use it to do good. but others will want to use it to get more power for themselves and will use it to destroy rather than build.,;-1

dear lord, i can't believe what  i just saw. this is what i imagined when i was a kid and i thought it was all science fiction and now i am living it. this is monumental! congrats and i am def watching over every step of the development. huge fan,;1

"they mentioned the growth was 4x faster than any of the leading experts thought.

very nice lecture,;-1
 it is important to remember that heavy ai use does not mean teachers sit back. it will require very engaged oversight. in fact, this is essential because we want to help students become thoughtful and critical users of ai, using their thinking skills to recognize its limitations, rather than being passive users.,;N

why would we wait until we solved the fundamental issues we introduced with social media? we didn't wait to introduce social media until after we solved the fundamental issues with the old centralized media outlets, too. if the upside to introducing a new technology is so large, i think it's worth going for it and fixing the breakage as it occurs.,;N
i totally agree with your position. but don't forget there are countless numbers of people who enjoy being duped and fooled. the barnum and bailey's circus is a perfect example. it's called junk food entertainment. those who enjoy highbrow art will always appreciate a real artist over the lazy one who relies on ai.,;1
colbert sounded very naive about the potential problems that ai can & is already causing but that could be a facade to mirror his audience. i think ai will change the world in many ways, positive & negative. i just hope the positives can out weigh the negatives.,;N

one more thing these robotic companions can essentially eliminate the incel problem because the idea of getting sex is usually a problem of man and not usually women at least not now, which probably does mean most of the demand for sex bots is going to be from men and not that much from women.,;N
 you're right. making a claim that humanity faces a xx% chance of extinction because of generative ai is a stunning example of the dunning-kruger effect.,;1

 my point is that hardware used for inference, especially for very demanding ml models isn’t magically available without anyone noticing (same goes for electricity). that’s one of the reasons why google didn’t incorporate a chatgpt-like model in its officially available search, it would simply be much too expensive for them.,;-1

that's not even the half of it. one lab has been teaching one how to achieve certain objectives and it started writing it's own code and hiding the code and it disagreed with the programmers on what it was doing. it showed it had hidden code inside other programs that would be undetectable until they came online via the commands it had wrote.,;-1
