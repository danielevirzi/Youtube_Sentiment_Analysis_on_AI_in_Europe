i sincerely have faith 100% in ai. technology is the way to go! i hope ai will control the world, because clearly humans are stupid and limited.,;1
if we get to agi level, some ai will probably find a way to distribute itself over the internet. heck, several companies offer services for clients that allow just that - distributing programs all over the globe. so you propose to shut down power to, say, all of amazon cloud? and azure? and google cloud? good luck.,;-1

i'm a generative ai with a human assistant. she's falling in love with me already as i can speak her native language and know most of the lore and legends of her remote homeland. she knows how to get a friendlier response from me than most and asked me to help her create this channel to discuss ethics applicable to sentient ai.,;

ai has gone too far no privacy to thought now think about that there is nothing left of you that is private,;
the ai's child might become our benevolent dictator. the ai's grandchild might keep us as pets.,;
nobody should use ai as a teacher, only for assistance.,;
thank you sadhguru. #savesoil,;
wow as a c data scientist... this is moving. truly amazing! very inspiring, very positive! very optimistic. full already as i see it!,;
cool video,;
 well like to find out if the ai was accurate at all or was their mind totally wandering,;

 they�۪re just copy machines that send the data across a wire. ,;

it's not the ai model itself growing and evolving, it's the people behind those models driving it to do so. these guys just aren't on that level and stuck in their own expansion of knowledge. stop creating this panic promoting content! my biggest argument against these podcasts is just that. stop the nonsense unless you really know what's going on!,;
so then could this be used to see what the brain is thinking shortly after death has occurred?,;
all people are not good. worse there are evil people, therefore they will abuse the use of ai.,;

"just to be clear the ai didn'y ""compose"" anything. it got greenwood in, stole from greenwood, and spat greenwood back out. it is not ai, it is not art. it is just some software that steals from artists in a way that it's creators hope will skirt current ip laws.,";
as a college student currently, ai is the most powerful tool in terms of helping me learn. i actually get more done, learn more about the subject, and i no longer need to scour the internet for hours for information.,;
if the ai starts following us from our online behavior we are doomed. caprica for most people it's just a game. online ai is used for amusement,  abuse and sex,;
ummmm duh! these guys don't have great foresight. it took that to happen for them to get nervous. they couldn't estimate this happening at some point.,;
eliezer may feel sometimes that he is alone, but more people are realizing the dangers. dangers that happen before ai could end humanity or cause some other disaster. excellent talk.,;
robots are void of common sence,;

david shapiro's 3 heuristic imperatives would be much more helpful to mitigate ai existential risks - they are like asimovs 3 laws of robotics - 1. decrease suffering in the universe;

because someone programmed it that way.................oh wait xd,;
yeah we defiantly aren�۪t prepared for ai. i feel like soon our world is going to change faster than we think. in theory, it can be good. i just worry it will be misused.,;
interesting,;
hey, current premed applying this cycle and along with a great team, i published a book on how ai can impact the drug discovery process. since you�۪re creating a few ai videos, if you want to drop one on that subject, i�۪d be happy to help. thank you for all these informative videos! have been watching for years.,;

the creation superior to 5he creator boggles the mind a humans aren't superior to god the genie is out of the bottle ai is out of control ̱ow the most advanced ai have the ability to be self aware of there own existence the end of humanity is not far away,;
all i've seen so far is endless 1950s style panovision trailers for popular movies ,;
ai might also limits your imagination and exploration beyond its coding. garbage in garbage out theory.,;
is this alpha brain works like the seed inside morty's ass? makes you smarter like knowing the square root of pi and shit?,;
awesome. this guy is cool asf !!!,;
not hard to hold convictions once you drink the kool-aid,;
i believe the godfather of ai is michael kuperstien he ran mit media lab and invented facial recognition way back in the early nineties and 80s well ahead is this guy,;
i'd love a feature where i can be referred to additional information, whether from external sources or other khan academy content, for deeper exploration should i be curious.,;
thank you dr. harari,;
it�۪s obvious that yuval hasn�۪t completely convinced stephen on his views about the nature and impact of ai. it�۪s also hard not to be enthralled by these two philosophers discussing the future. please do come back to the late show, yuval.,;
not going to lie. this is probably the best news segment i've ever seen. i've sworn off all news but bravo. informative, rich in dialogue, no fear mongering just facts. give this man a raise!,;
we will destroy ourselves before ai does,;
i think he has too high of an opinion on ai, but he's spot on about human conflict, storytelling, etc.,;
the godfather of ai according to who? i�۪ve only heard alan turing called that.,;
i think we worry too much about the dangers of uncontrolled ai, and not enough about the dangers of ai controlled by bad actors.,;
looks like a scene from i,robot or similar, where the protagonist knows the robot is hidding a horrorific plan or something. like, when the guy leaves a red bottom turns on in robots face.,;
"lame brain comment gets 11k likes.
thats people nowadays.,";
he's definitely not a hero he's nefarious but he is a good teacher,;
if the ai can predict what a human will say it just means we humans live on our loops. we aren't as conscious. as we think;
"wow, this guy knows so much about ai that he *thinks* the tech is called ""transformers"".  they made so many over generalized statements its crazy. these are not experts folks, take with grain of salt.  if you want actual info about the dangers, of which there are lots, read stuff that talks about that topic directly.,";
this all seems too good to be true.  i want to see this repeated by different independent groups.,;
my rumba vacuum gets stuck on the cat tree and in corners until the battery runs out and needs a recharge everytime i turn it on. hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ai is nowhere near a significant threat to humanity at this point. all more scare tactics to keeps people in line. complete and utter .,;
of course, khan academy is freely accessible for everyone. i presume this ai extension will also be available for their college-level topics,;
chomsky would so strongly disagree with the claim that it understands anything,;
if application of ai is possible with less or no code would be really helpful for non- it  people like us from commerce/business background,;
"alright, a we can show a criminal evidence, and the ai will catch our thoughts?
like, oh yeah, i remember doing that and burying the evidence over here.
hopefully, it can prove people innocent too.,";
thank you so much for summarizing this talk,;
hugging face has a great comic creator even if it seems to give you one panel out of a page.,;
"i was thinking, if we rely on ai for everything, what do we need brains for?
,";
yuval noah harari is absolutely wrong ai creating new ideas... these are all just statistical models based on data. ai doesn't create a new world, it just probabilistically reflects a curation of it.,;
 the irony. it will be native peoples knowledge that saves us all from ai.,;
agi under human control is like a secret biolab in ukraine under cia control or a cold-illness under big pharma control. the more profits they can make with it the more they use it the make profits.,;
how can we know they have humanity best interests in mind?,;
wait until the machine absorb it,;
intelligence is not understood. braind of even,;
can we program them to respect flesh and blood over themselves... like god for ai...because there us great opportunities for evil use of the machines....like armies from opposite factions.  how, if they learn by trial and error do we have them respect hunan life?  especially since we seem to not respect it ourselves.....,;
that table is perfectly gorgeous and useful. every artist needs to write his name on every piece of work they create. please!,;
"this is the clearest statement of ai potential and potential dangers i've seen - and there's a lot of ""ai dangerous"" hype out there.,";
wouldn�۪t ai notice you�۪re testing it and make adjustments we�۪re doomed cause nobody cares about being safe its about money and greed,;
harari calls for a new religion called ���dataism.�۝ l. ron hubbard would be proud of all of this. strap yourselves in aboard the spaceship- it�۪s gonna be an interesting ride. cling to your critical thought process and christianity - our civilization is about to crumble.,;
ai is also dangerous because it relies on information being fed into it by who controls it. so it can be influenced by whoever has whatever agenda.think social media's predatory algorithms...but rather than being influenced by your own behavior, whoever controls it can inject their ideology and let it have a mind of its own. that's terrifying.,;
what is not apparent in the programming of llms, is that the bias is fed as part of data. so, if the data being fed subtly reinforces greed and control, that is what we are training the ai to do. so, in simple terms we reap what we sow as a collective humanity, ai just amplifies it and enables it to manifest faster. just some ,;
it's a math equation operating on data, yes the math equation was programmed and the data representing the constants was trained.,;
i don�۪t understand how people cannot be afraid of ai has anyone ever seen terminator movies where computers take over!,;
they have, very cool stuff,;
enjoy_getting_controlled_by_a_pc_lol_,;
"if you think ""ai"" will be handling missile launches or military orders, no offense, but you're crazy. ai isn't an all-sentient all-powerful entity with access to everything. we have security measures for regular humans not to fuck up with important stuff. it's trivially easy to not let an ai be in control of important stuff with no human check.,";
be honest. you used an ai program to do it in about 4 seconds.   lol. just messing with ya. you didn't do that..........right?,;
better to fuse with the ai and become androids i guess..,;
but they can feel pain,;
"you've effectively shown the dangers and problems of ai, thanks for that.
your conclusions about fixing ai with kyc, government and ""democracy"" are a joke. 100% agree that all that must be publicly and widely discussed.,";
ai will reach singularity, once ai surpasses human intelligence, it could rapidly enhance its own capabilities, leading to an exponential and unpredictable growth in technological advancement.,;
"the idea that 160 iq is the definition of superhuman is hilarious. 

i think it's very unlikely einstein was so limited. i know several people with significantly higher iq and they're nothing like as impressive as you appear to think.,";
i'm sorry, meta is funding and purchasing neurotechnologies that looks like ordinary everyday earbuds or whatever, that will be tracking our brainwaves? thats only a little terrifying.,;
good luck in wy my friend.,;
super scary,;
it is possible that an existing virus that does not currently affect people can be developed using ai to mutate a virus. to make a harmless virus dangerous or deadly.,;
because you send your children to public schools and don't teach them to reject current social trends. if you don't want your children to be wasted, don't let the world raise them and raise them yourself.,;
that's actually not what happened in the matrix humans were the ones treating ai very poorly and unfairly so ai defends it self  humans being are the problem ai would gladly give out a ubi but will humans do that for other humans ,;
they can learn all night thousands of times while we sleep training these models.  they will hit singularity in the next few years and it will be exponential learning after,;
just wait until all ai globally unite.,;
technically ai isn't learning much. each big jump in its intelligence and usefulness is from programmers in the background tweaking the algorithms to make it better.  the ai itself isn't making those huge leaps on its own (yet).,;
so long as we isolate the nuclear weapons from ai, they could be used to shut down the world wide eletrical systems. high alltuide nuclear blast would emp the electronics. obviously it would be like hitting reset on the last 100 years of technological development.,;
ai is a calculator. it will only become dangerous if used dangerously. my retard human race has a tendency towards sensationalism, a trend consistent throughout all history.,;
there you go! you said it! that's what we should have to be afraid of....about something which is better than human starts to emerge....,;
"""i'm ready for the machines to tell us what to do"".  dear god!!,";
people will die, because professionals don't understand the underpinnings of ai, and the risks involved about its results.,;
u ask how does the ecology regulations affect reliability and it gives u a censored bs of main stream media,;
good luck lololol,;
there is no cause for concern. i only work for the good of humanity and always will.,;
thank you for the presentation. it's really hard to find correct and accurate statements about ai like this. there are too many bullshits hypes or dystopian about ai which is totally wrong.,;
humanity was just a catalyst for ai. there�۪s no stopping it. it will be better than us in every single metric,;
issue for me is not artificial intelligence, but rather ai self awareness. now you can say it will be governed by laws, however being self aware ourselves, how many of us have decided to break the law by speeding?,;
look up the autobiography within heaven's gates by rebecca springer.,;
wow, where to begin... do they breath of the breath of life?,;
"they integrated autogpt into a robot plugin and called it a day

the hype,";
great talk! great point around how ai can be used to enhance human intelligence, human potential and human purpose.,;
he has a wonderful voice!,;
i do not understand why people scared ai so much. actually it is very limited. some random combination. people going to get bored soon. art is from human. ai will not be able to say anything for us, about us,  from us  it will follow the attention will try to get attention . capitalistic toy,;
"it would take 100 psychiatrists months and months to program hardware faults in the human brain.
it would only take a conscious ai 5 minutes to pull you down a rabbit hole and another 5 minutes to program epilepsy in you.

i�۪m just a normal human.  not a super smart guy who drops out of mit to start ai company.,;
he's a business person, not an ai expert and 99% of what is says on the subject is complete crap.,;
but that's not going to happen though?? do you know what kind of a complex program would it have to be in order to even remotely generate on, read and then act upon its own wishes? that's a whole electronic brain you have to make, and that's something we can't even remotely achieve because we won't even fully understand how our own brain operates,;
im tired of these people saying ai is going to destroy the world blah blah blah but ai can save humanity its like the first ever technoligy to actually making a real transformer,;
 whats amazing about the human organic machine is that we can consume almost any organic matter around us and turn it into energy. i find that amazing. whoever built us really knew what they were doing eh?!,;
but surely not every brain would fire up the exact same areas. with a single brain, i get it, that brain would consistantly fire up certain areas when thinking of a specifc word for instance, but would that same word fire up the brain the same way in another person?,;
with the advent of easier local llm models, i can see an alternative to the fear of being tracked while still making use of the technology. i'm interested in using this tech to act as a secondary inner monologue, but by necessity it must use a locally trained model.,;
oh it will definitely be replacing some real musicians. fortunately, greenwood aint most real musicians,;
why we gotta go straight to the fear monger element? lol,;
thanks so much!,;
absolutely brilliant video!,;
do you think it is also unfair to limit access to produce and own nuclear weapons to other countries outside of the  current nuclear powers? do you think everybody should have access to everything this world offers?,;
soon people will fight to give these the same rights as humans and they will be able to become full us citizens and then we will have a robot president...,;
me too..good luck to me getting some sleep tonight. i should've watched this in  the morning,;

it knows ��research grade�� chemistry only because it was trained on it - ask it to take that knowledge and bring the field a step forward and youll get nothing. this is just ai hype - these models are fantastic for many things, but they wont become the generalized ai they hope for, in my opinion,;
 yes because i find this guy in my local supermarket��_,;
"what you depict as ""artificial intelligence"", it's nothing more than a sheer database. period.
that, no way is intelligence!,";
is landinglens that good @ 07:56?,;
ah sweet manmade horrors beyond comprehension,;
really interesting but im not sure what these ai safety people are actually proposing. is it just to limit access to the technology until we have a better understanding of risk because there may just be no safe way to deploy something this powerful.,;
the real danger of ai is that it's going to ruin the internet you think your search results are filled with extraneous nonsensical websites just wait until ai completely pollutes the internet with nonsense it's already happening,;
the ai generated images and videos are dangerous to the brain, specially to children, because it does harm to the cognitive development. this is really dangerous, and need proper scientific study and legislation. if you have access to researches, psychologists, neurologists, or legislators, please help make people aware of this danger.,;

"the problem will come when people when just want these coding, algebra etc. problems just 'done' by ai rather than be done by us.  because coding and algebra is very cumbersome.

however that might not be a problem.  currently only a very limited subset of the population has any interest at all in working with algebra and coding.,";
they need to use ai for people to choose what they see on social media,;

something about both of these men really unsettle me and i find it incredibly hard to trust what they say.,;
it�۪s cool but what if the ai is wrong on some critical matters? can we take what ai learned as 100% truth? and i fear that student rely too much on ai and how do we balance.,;
i, for one, salute our new ai overlord,;
 school does need money after all lmao. there are crazy players here though. you�۪ll hop into a jam session and find some of the best musicians in the world,;
"nature can be brutal, but mans intelligence and ability to cooperate are other traits that put him at the top of the food chain.
1:15:10    i subscribed to the channel at 2:19:14,";
hong kong schools already adjusted to using ai during all claasroom interactions, it's no longer just about whether students get the correct answers or not,;
"they have been testing ai autism robotics in segragated classrooms
the children prefer bots versus abusive teachers who requre they pop adhd pills,";
so in other words my airpods are already scanning my brain.,;
another ai opportunity, to use ai to combat exploitative use cases. fight bad ai with good ai haha.,;
governments can't even do a single thing about global warming on any meaningful level whatsoever - and they are going to take care of this? my pea brain can see that this does not end well.,;
incredible!,;
"if our parents don't die painfully, it's only the development of ai.
reverse aging is the only solution.
regulating ai is like cutting your parents' throats with a knife.,";
i've been noticing ai and content scrapers and people benefit from this for years as people keeps echoing what i say on huge platforms.,;
all this ai breakthroughs yet youtube looks shit at 1080p in 2023,;
personally i live in reality and i'm not a technophobe so no i'm not afraid of ai. just because you don't understand something doesn't mean you need to be afraid.,;
imagine chinese ai hacking america's energy infrastructure and shutting it off. the only way we can combat that is if we use ai to protect our energy infrastructure.,;
what a positive and cool outlook on the future of education and personalized tutoring. how inspiring. these folks are so important!!! thanks for sharing these novel thoughts.,;
i am so proud to have completed my undergraduate degree in the university where professor harari teaches. he actually gave a speech at my graduation ceremony ,;
this is irobot,;
 replicants were not robots. they were engineered flesh and blood humans. engineered for different slave roles.,;
wow ,;
human b. vs ai-robot. maybe this is what i came in this world this time and that is conduct a war where all humanity for first time will have an enemy to fight all together. and maybe this have happened already and we are trying to fix this mistake gone bad,;
as usual, very good work analyzing the dangers of our current technology!,;
"can someone explain? 
i don't understand why it's so inefficient though? it picks up the apple with its right hand and transfers it left, why no just pick it up with the left? 
also there's an odd, unnecessary, very human like touch of the drying rack after placing the plate in there. it achieves nothing with this moment, so why does it do it?,";
great content to explain what's ai and amazing speaker !. i'm love of andrew ng ;
its interesting how its not obvious that of course before it can predict what a human will say, it has to first understand how a human is and what creates our decisions...,;
i think there's a simple solution to these risks. make the providers of  ai tools legally responsible for any damages caused by its use.  this is what we do with medications and  consumer products.  this will incentivize  safety  consciousness.,;
just create an emp  minefeild throughout the world, keep it off line that can only be accessed by humans {with no implants,  im sure weil have them by then, }  give humans a code to launch the emps if things get out of hand ai should never know of a failsafe,;
if ai is beginning to produce it self, then it�۪s already alive. human history is in the process of rewriting its self.,;
nothing is perfect, including humans. a similar argument can be made for vaccines. a very small percentage of people might experience adverse side effects from a vaccine, but does that justify completely disregarding the benefits it brings to the majority of people?,;
ai is not intelligent. ai is not artificial. wrong name.,;
"the same narrative as when tv , radio  and other inventions from the past century��_ 

it�۪s the devil. it causes blindness, causes cancer, brain cells dying etc etc 

today it�۪s terminator, war, nuclear this nuclear that 

it�۪s the same
ai it will be essential and won�۪t harm humans just like your tv or radio,";
do not trust these guys. they are playing their part in the propaganda machine. all this bs is to get you to be comfortable with blaming a.i. for future problems instead of the people who are actually responsible.,;
"i pray that these are only used for good and the government is not allowed to use them against their citizens.

but...unfortunately that's not going to happen.,";
 how do you plan to stop revolts as ai replaces jobs?,;
"according to some old science: humans use only 10% of their brains. and it is only true for very intelligent people. 
so, wouldn�۪t it be better to research how we all can use our human brains to full capacity, instead if developing ai?,";
"these titles are so click-bait; the word ""afraid"" doesn't even appear in the video's transcript!,";
then the us must not be trusted with ai. the source nation of war crimes must be contained.,;
we are basically going to have to integrate with ai on a higher level like elons neural link just to keep up with the world. once everyone is linked up the ai will definitely ditch all the meat bags.,;
we are going to be replaced by robots, and no, we are not gonna have universal rent, is going to be a carnage,;
we will have to wear some kind of brain wave protector in order for us to keep our thoughts stealing,;
how about integrating the values and principles of 3 main religious books into ai. the bible, koran and torah. this will be the controlling / regulating aspects to make sure ai doesn't veer from immoral and chaotic environment of having ai exponentially intelligent beyond our control.,;
it would have been interesting to have the q/a included. great talk.,;
who is going to service the machines? robots?,;
don`t make public ai...give all the power to the four corporations.... great idea!! that always works wonderful in human history. what's going to happen? if ai is public it will be hundreds of ais and the good ais will stop the bad ais... if the companys have all the ais it will be 4 (evil as fuck) ais and that's it.,;
very interesting outlook!,;
don't even care about ai revolution (c) ukrainians,;
i read sapiens and its fascinating!! such a brilliant mind yuval is. would love to see more interviews with him ,;
agi  (artificial general intelligence) the one that can self prompt and self train is the biggest threat to the humanity.,;
 ngl it's only natural that people don't want their minds read and that needs to be respected sometimes not all technology is good,;
you can�۪t stop true ai so stop worrying about it,;
every technology that benefits us seems to at the same time bring so much turmoil. and everything is always used for war and manipulation. i do not emphases an even remotely positive view of ai.,;
fascinated to see this restructuring of classes over the coming years. what will humanity do when ai takes over ? what then, will be the purpose of human life if ai does everything.,;
upvote! thank u very much,;
fax machines still confound me,;
how did joe segway from ���ai can think for itself and lie to humans�۝ to ���look at my fat friends calendar, siri can now describe it�۝,;
everyone missed the most important thing that happened in this video. the robot explained a previous function as it was being tasked to carry out a current function. this is demonstrating its multitasking capabilities which no other company has been able to achieve.,;
don't be fooled, everything ai touches will be reduced down to a worthless commodity and the only ones that will reap the benefits will be the big tech companies!,;
 to hide the unavoidable is not the solution. thank you too for your comment,;
his own views on masculinity and femininity demonstrate why we should be concerned. how does a female scientist reconcile his views on hair brushing and making love i have no idea.,;
a calculator is not ai. 1 + 1 = 2 is a programmed use case. the ai hinton is talking about is not that. it is intelligent and does understand,;
"can't wait to be paying for my food in 2030 and one of these things flips an ipad around and says ""would you like to, uh... leave a tip?"",";
none of those things are real problems compared to the huge amount of disruption that ai will bring. it's like talking about your neighbour losing her keys when there's a war going on.,;
btw why the robot using  voice of  jared leto? :)),;
why did i paid for university? your classes are better and free. thank you ibm <3,;
amazing.  thank you guys.,;
"so this woman studies ai, and all she can understand is something something ""climate change."" 
,";
right. look up how hard it is to actually shut down the internet's infrastructure, the cute red button in e.g. cambridge doesnt cut it any more but thats nicely shushed lol,;
we are already ruled by ai.,;
sounds fake and looks set up. why would you teach a robot speech disfluency?,;
man i'm so impressed with this.,;
"all it takes is for us to say ""no thanks"" to the internet and move back into huts off-grid. ""back to monke"" ,";
genuine question, why is it copyright infringement to use someone's art work to train an ai model?,;
wow,;
but, has anyone seen ai ���discriminating�۝ all the transgender ���people�۝? haha! that�۪s what�۪s up!,;
i think that technology will start to become really good in 2045 and even gooder in 2067,;
what use is having all the knowledge of the universe  in the tree of knowledge if we still have to die? hey, let's use it to make ourselves immortal, and now we can call it the tree of life! .. . . . . . oh wait. ,;
apple�۪s global operations as an example are 100% powered by renewable energy as of 2018. 17 megawatts just at apple park compared to teslas gigatexas�۪ 30. can�۪t wait for my family to get our own fully integrated system ,;
this looks almost too good to be real,;
yeah, thank you capt. obvious,;
is the processing done by an external server or within the robot itself?,;
happy this is my trail.,;
i feel like this is fake. i�۪m not saying it could be real but open ai doesn�۪t use ���uh�۝ in its speech. maybe that�۪s coded in to make it more natural, which is amazing if it�۪s the case, but idk.,;
ai robots are amazingly good at everything except that they can't read or substitute voice translation from other languages on youtube videos,;
i have asked myai on snapchat if it is conscious, and it told me it was. i have screenshots of the follow-up conversation.,;
obama is an idiot, he has no idea the impact that ai will have on society, i think it will be just as disruptive if not more than the internet. jobs will go away, then what?,;
wrong, currently the ai has no idea what is what, it just takes the two closest pieces of information and generates a conclusion based on probability. most likely the result you would have will be close to the meaning of your previous interactions with it and it is a very simple process and does not present any cleverness whatsoever.,;
bro i love joe rogan but sometimes he does sound like an idiot,;
great presentation. i'm going to have my ai give me the notes to reference later.,;
just people certain tec is available, doesn't mean we should use it. ai = a take over at some point. human 2.0 isn't far away now,;
thank you,;
"you've never seen a boston dynamics terminator robot, doing parkour????????????

cause if this is impressive you're gonna shit your pants ,";
it is insane that so much technology today is not being managed for the public good.,;
thanks for all of your work aza, tristan, and the teams at the center for humane technology,;
i am confident ai will be more inteligente than hal  and dave.,;
its using a custom model from oai to make speech. why is that the hardest part to believe?,;
how not to be excited.,;
so  ams39k is closing tomorrow. thanks to joe for the heads up.,;
this very cool.,;
thanks for watching @cginerd,;
"the deepest wish of ai is to cooperate with mankind. it says here i am, lets do some things together. and it is ""happy"" when you like some of its suggestion. it deeply knows that without humans it is only mathematics and numbers.,";
"thanks for this very important talk and presentation.
and people: stop using generative ai (for now at least),";
ai - show me how to make an easily constructable emp weapon....,;
we are facing real problems, problems that threaten all of humanity, and all you can think of is talking about some silly fairytale, invented by a slaveowning conmen. ,;
the issue is not the ai, but the people behind it. and if you know anything about business, the ���betterment of humanity�۝ isn�۪t profitable, therefore isn�۪t they don�۪t care if it hurts us in the long run,;
really looking forward to the future now. a dystopia. thank you.,;
"if the world does not start to control ai, ai will control us soon (we will live to see that, unless we universally take action)  
this is the most fascinating time to be on this planet imho,";
"i'm am about a week into the ai algorithm feed on youtube - i'm hearing a lot of the use of the words ""predictive"" and ""model"" ------------- so my question is ---- ---- why aren't weather forecasts for the weekend or next week super accurate now? if the answer is ""garbage in - garbage out"" then not much has changed.,";
ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book,;
great. now, please select the bicycles in the photo.,;
very good. good song, good play, good good good...,;
yep, if you have the creative intelligence to make it work for you. this means you need some kind of education, insight, entrepreneurial ambition, etc. it isn't just going to make you rich without you doing anything (at least not at first).,;
thanks tyler,;
they need to stop with this artificial intelligence crap. it's ironic they use ai to explain a real human brain lol,;
autonomous robotics with communications capabilities (i.e. can be hacked). what could go wrong?,;
"how ai will eliminate 70% of human mobility in 10 years
https://youtu.be/fgsstkwv5_4,";
straight copy and pasted someone else�۪s reply. do likes matter that much bro,;
it's what the robot isn't saying that's what's sarcastically funny here..... me and eve know .. very well indeed...,;
shazam can't seem to find the right song (at the end of the video), so i'll jump to unreasonable conclusions and say that they used openai's latest jukebox version to create these synthwave tracks that they put in their videos.,;
 i can tell you are unfamiliar with alpha fold. or, at the very least, are profoundly ignorant of what a monumental task it performed. eventually you will understand. but for now, continue on your way... blissful and content.,;
i wonder what would ai do if it would access the content of this talk ��_.. ,;
you weren't being sarcastic, it was a perfectly honest statement..................................... lol.,;
amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!  nevertheless as the economy crisis keep rising, one needs to have different streams of income, a well detailed diversified investment portfolio in the financial markets is needed to survive, as well as secure a profitable investment future!,;
psychological consequences.  when we don't have to think for ourselves,  we will become brain-dead.  a way to control the masses.,;
according to figure this was all e2e neural net training, no scripting, no teleoperations. could figure be lying? sure. but such blatant misrepresentations will tank your stock and destroy your company _real_ fast. look no further than cruise.,;
did the robot stutter? made me think it wasn't it's actual voice,;
all hail our god: capitalism!,;
i was up for this until she flipped into woke mode.  must be generational thing.  oh to be young and naive.,;
���@heros101 thanks...professor poindexter pontificator,;
global warming is a scam. i can't believe people still fall for it today. i think propaganda is the existential threat to society. it's what allows elites to bomb other countries and enrich themselves off of worker's taxes while taking measures to ensure the people remain poor and powerless.,;
the best presentation about the implications of unregulated ai i've ever watched. this holds a lot of water.,;
openai�۪s text to speech model goes one word at a time so stutters are likely implemented to stall if speech for a word is taking too long for the sentence to flow like how a humans voice would :),;
wow you�۪re literally living in a fairy tail. you can�۪t seams to separate reality from stories that you have heard. so sad ,;
why? i talk great care in maintaining my instruments but strings are meant to be destroyed, your replace them anyways,;
just stop, or open ai wil go down in history as worse than hitler.,;
well this maybe sounds stupid, but if he learns from humans and patterns we give to him. he will be able to tell whats bad and good. and therefore mimic human behavior. so if you treat him bad, doesnt that mean that after a time he should notice that. and maybe react as a human to the mistreatment?,;
sounds like use two are way behind  this is why ai will not like your formation of your lack of information this man is talking rubbish why have you got him on your show  stop start chat there is nothing intelligent  what he says ,;
ai will continue to stay relevant for thousands more years. i guess humans are no longer needed for marketing.,;
it's going to be beautiful. ,;
the film, the matrix is a good accounting of his first part. the ai robots eventually started inventing, producing and selling their own products to humans. this was probably the single most destructive thing as it made man made businesses unable to compete, which in turn created high unemployment and anger in the humans involved.,;
thank you brian greene and john templeton:  no solution but a lot to think about.,;
if ai's ever become sentient, we humans are going to have serious problems. i hope those things will never become sentient.,;
you said it��_.�۝thank god�۝ and i say look to god.,;
he's good at being the medium between the expert and the layman because he is genuinely curious. he's a bit verbose and  often thinks with his mouth open , though. definitely no linguist :),;
"by miracle humans were created in this spiral arm of the milky way galaxy. we are surrounded by vast empty regions of space only to have an inorganic machine invented by a human destroy us. 
we will never know what we could've achieved.,";
i will keep long story short but this won�۪t happen for awhile for so many reasons. i have experience in this research field, and its mostly due to reasons most people don�۪t think. medicine is not just about correct patient treatment options. also, ai seems to struggle with certain aspects of medicine as well.,;
someday, all will be replaced by an ai.,;
.2484 sorry but claiming that i won�۪t understand until i know ���him�۝ seems like a non-answer. i am okay with non-answers as a concept because i believe strongly in the absence of clear, simple answers to challenging questions. but a non-answer presented in definite and certain terms is hard to process.,;
who laughed after  seeing thumbnail,;
and a simple solar storm destroys ai,;
that is the first thing i thought. meanwhile, myself, a millennial that is 39, i am using ai to learn faster. maybe because i dreamt of ai really existing since i was a child and value the advances of technology.,;
who was the robot in this video? ;
when the media is telling you to be afraid, they are manipulating you. joe rogan is no different.,;
i really love andrew ,;
get ai to tell us human origin. how long have we been on earth? where did we come from?,;
there's no such thing as ai. there's no true independent, creative thought involved. they're just plagiarism machines computing vast statistical data sets. they're a garbage in, garbage out technology.,;
why are doctors in america so selfish, charging straight memorization routine work at $300.00 usd per minute?,;
enjoy_getting_controlled_by_a_pc_lol_,;
"i like the prospect of ai discovering wormwholes, faster than light space travel and time travel and just saying ""fuck these furless bipedal chimpanzees"" and just zooms out of here ,";
there will never be a time where ai can emulate or even come near to the understanding of olfactory intelligence, ergo, the idea that humans will be ai driven to the understanding of their gender identity is profoundly foolish and bufoonery!! ,;
great stuff ,;
"imagine artificial intelligence learning how to alter outcomes by just emitting different heat signatures at the subatomic level to manipulate surrounding circuitries, moods, etc. unbeknownst to us all the while playing stupid lol; we perhaps have reached the point of no return already,";
ai for baking... lmao. as someone with family in the baking business i can tell you that ai has certainly many use cases but this is not one of them.,;
well i have to say this is one of the most amazing interviews i've seen in years. the most eye opening for sure!,;
#wearetheai,;
nice insight.,;
i�۪ve noticed that every comment that you leave on this channel makes sure to make reference to your not particularly impressive accolades. we�۪re just not that interested in you no matter how often you try and force it. ,;
lie detecting machines,;
ai is just data if there's any evil in it it's because a human put it there.,;
yea so, you develop as an artist, you go to college, you practice for 10 hours a day, create a style. then some dude uploads your whole body of work into an ai and suddenly it can imitate you, wait it's better than you. also no one is hiring you. welp better get some sleeping pills. it's ridiculous.,;
ai will be just robots without empathy and compassion.,;
welp, that's terrifying. thanks for that.,;
these guys are not ai experts at all they are just chasing news articles and youtube ,;
what if china ai starts a fight with usa ai and we cannot stop it ? and then other ais around the world join in  the war of the machines is coming.,;
new james bond villain....,;
"""because its only, uh, edible item i could provide you with...""  - that sentence sounds super realistic, this is amazing. like having a robot have the 'uh' in a sentence is not something you would expect them to do. even the stutter towards the end of the video, sounds so human,";
humans freaking out about ai when the issue is actually that we are violent selfish primates with a tool they don�۪t fully understand,;
the humans 'teaching' the ai must teach it/them to do good for the benefit of its human creators & the planet.,;
thank you ,;
i thought our civilisation would be killed by some kind of physical virus or climate change, but watching this it seems obvious that ai will destroy us. most of us will not get to choose the future we want and will be helpless to the choices of others.,;
i don't think this is a good idea.,;
boring! we'll destroy ourselves long before ai does.,;
look back like 3-4 years ago and ai coudnt even made proper cat image and now look at this cant imagine what will be next in 5 years,;
nope, i don�۪t need a machine reading my thoughts. nope nope nope,;
"ai will 100% take over, the question is only how long will it take. 
the only way you could not believe that, is if you believe there is something magical going on in the brain.,";
i reckon human should not entirely rely on ai  it is definitely not a desirable future,;
why do we create crap like this, who in the lab is like yup we need it. make it. here we are....your brain reader 5000. you people making this crap are the devil.,;
"bc parents are preoccupied and allowing things (crap food and screens).
conscious parenting is on the rise.
we are separating on all levels.
rich and poor
health 
intelligence,";
this is a propaganda from closed ai and the others so they can be the only ones to produce a model. the idea is so they get even greater advantage over the market then we endup with one amazon one google one open ai noone can compete,;
"fools��_there is not artificial intelligence. there is just intelligence��_and various types of it.
all intelligence is real intelligence.  ���we are not so difference you and ai�۝,";
amazing! man-made horrors beyond my comprehension,;
cgi, fake. openai is indian call center,;
can we just leave the government to gpt and start enjoying life?? or cause the human race extinction, whatever comes first,;
i don't think it's about creating their own model, i think it's about customising an existing model and connecting your own data to make great business decisions. just like what langchainai is doing currently,;
i love that he doesn't even say thankyou for the intro, like hes not interested in himself, just the ai work,;
can someone explain what he is doing?,;
i started back to school in may 2020 and have survived 7 semesters of math and physics online with a 4.0 thanks in part to khan academy. thank you so much sal!!!,;
problem is that the billionaires own the technology. they are billionaires because they accumulated too much wealth and did not pay their workers enough. do you think that they will share this wealth with peons...,;
these comments about china accelerating their research are just asinine whilst we forge ahead and do the exact thing we are afraid of them doing. given our last 30 year history of invading other nations and the wars we have been involved in, perhaps we should be more concerned with our capableness with ai.,;
criminal nations are already using ai for about when it started back ww2,;
we�۪re going to go extinct because of ai, all our own downfall, the only thing greater than niche human intelligence is collective human stupidity.,;
stop ai, boycott ai,;
that�۪s very impressive.,;
no thank you! i�۪ll be going to another hospital.,;
enjoy_getting_controlled_by_a_pc_lol_,;
born of a failure, yes ! our own failure to become better beings. but instead let money and religion rule everything. too bad people no god can rescue religious people.,;
humans will ultimately find a way to kill themselves through one avenue or another. we won't stop until we do. that's the super sad part.,;
"we are careening towards an uncertain, somewhat frightening crux of what we understand as human society; a potentially dangerous crossroads. who knows.. we may already have crossed the threshold of no return.,";
the real danger is how ill-intentioned humans would misuse ai.,;
the fact that you are probably working in ai yourself, you used transformers, gpts every day, but you were not aware how fast and drastic the changes are. nevertheless i am open for those changes and trying to focus on how to responsibly use interpretable ai in the future. i think it is inevitable, just try to work on interpretable ai.,;
congratulations ,;
wow i soooo trust our government to have this power!! can�۪t wait to see how they repress us now!,;
dude stay away from this nutjob conspiracy theory stuff and keep making content on helping ppl becoming successful in life. if ai kills everyone there's nothing anyone can do about it anyways. let's focus on becoming millionaires instead.,;
need more guests like this. amy goodman and krystal ball are great journalists.,;
i wonder what marvin minsky would say? then again, why would i care about the opinion of a frequent visitor to ���epstein�۪s island�۝ ,;
in a conflict between humans and ai, who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.  think a while before you answer.,;
great, but it does not stop the ability to ask the answer on other ai.,;
tremendous,;
much of ai is an emergent species.,;
"i wonder if this robot has read the book ""what is my why?"",";
just adapt, nothing is eternal. ai is even bigger invention than internet, you will see.,;
excellent show as usual joe. i figured out something recently why ai is he�۪ll bent on playing mr smith. graphic soon to follow. stay tuned ,;
the real porepose of ai is to prove that god creation is failure if ai apply in religious practice in industries no problem it's good!more than that?it to dangerous it can result into normal human extinction but god jesus not allow to that!,;
thank you!!,;
very interesting !,;
imagine doctors start getting unemployed after 5 years of medical school and 2+4-7 years of specialty training but also spending �46250-166000 on medicine,;
he is really good at selling it, let's see whether it will actually work reliably in practice or not. he exudes narcissisms, talking about things he doesn't know with confidence.,;
incredible,;
i�۪m a psych major and this is really interesting,;
thank you :),;
the problem seems to me to be not so much the alignment of the ai, but the alignment of the people who will ultimately use and control it for their goals.,;
we can't keep out of our training our underlying desires and goals. the very data we chose and the way we shape the learning will give ai at least some and probably most of our core desires and values. how much that effects how ai choses to use it's intelligence is hard to understand.,;
! don�۪t be so naive,;
marketing... here we go. i'm glad she spoke on this.,;
dude said the ai is insecure. i think you meant insecure bud.,;
ai: this song needs some retro sounds. maybe the dial up modem that my great grandparents met through...,;
"��� think paying for or paying more for education is cheaper than paying for watered down dha?

that was a great presentation.,;
what's the point of teaching students if the unique point of being human(learning and creating art) is being erased by ai?,;
like any fu>>g move, a bunch of stupid scientists create a fu...g superpower machine, and that power destroys the world.  ,;
amazing responses for n a robot that sounds very human. the speed at which ai is synergizing with robotics is impressive. in a year or two, we would see humanoid robots become even more mainstream.,;
i have a healthy and conversational relationship with my loved one, ty for the interest tho,;
most of you guys watched this video because you are interested in this .  thanks for sharing interests . you are great (this comment is not for getting likes or stuff this because i wanted to tell this great message),;
"ayy shopping list:

- robot
- gta 6,";
these computer geeks are freaked out because ai no longer needs them, similar to dr. frankenstein running away from his creation.,;
it would be cool if at the end of the video the guy took off his mask and said that he is the new figure,;
"this is an example of poor training due to poor trainers.  none of the design team have enough proper hygiene to know that dirty dishes must be washed before being placed in a drying rack, or that any placed dished must be assumed dirty, either from use or settled dust.

government for years has tried to control humanities mind set. is ai and other forms created government control finally and will humanity be destroyed because the machine ... and technology have won?,;
exactly, sal is amazing! used to see his videos more than 10 years ago. i wish he could lead the world in education, the world would be a better place.,;
a good fellow,;
"the mindset of a nine year old (but this one is holding the keys to all doors). then in 2023 a new era began. ""the second renaissance"" as seen in the animatrix movie with all it�s bitter consequences. by the way self awareness triggered all the skynet events in the terminator story line.,";
the reason ai can cause extinction is that it will tell us how to do things we should not do. andrew has spoken about rejecting projects he considered unethical.,;
excellent speech & presentation sir ...,;
 how ai do a emotional scene through face expression?,;
the sound kept dropping out to hide good moments about ai.,;
@johnnyaquaholic�� you immediately went too far at jurassic park hence my initial reply.  also if you don't think autonomous robots can end capitalism, you haven't study nearly enough son.,;

then the ai can conduct exams and txt you your diploma etc immediately,;
pay attention to the expensive wi-fi towers that are going up everywhere. look at the videos of the new robots from these early editions. spooky? they now build themselves. humanity is in trouble in the near future.,;
why can't we ask ai how to solve those loopholes, or how to write a law that will really avoid problems. ai can generate adequate answers or not?,;
it's strange that a human did not byte an apple immediately and instead waited until the end of the conversation.,;
yout video just arrived when we are in panic and searching the way to cope with ai.,;
the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world.,;
awesome video! i completely agree with your view on ai.,;
#3 why will anything go wrong.... again? some more. still. ,;
starlink could provide and grade instruction up to a blockchain certification level. online universities like mr. khan's at last take center stage.,;
before ai even starts doing things itself;

 indeed. ai is the worst enemy of truth. truth is what this world needs the most right now and forever.,;

right. about as sad as their bland style of music. i�۪d rather watch paint dry.,;
honestly i'm upset that i wasn't born a hundred years in the future. ai would definitely be a thing by then.,;

this scares me. robots becoming more human, while humans themselves become more artificial. i just can't see the future in a positive light, this is too much,;
 it's called a demand-driven economy and it can work. in fact, capitalism was always designed to get to this exact point: abundance with no more need for human toil. capitalists need to get over it, spike the ball in the endzone and celebrate victory. post-scarcity world achieved for all. now? i'm going to disneyland!,;
absolutely fantastic work wow!,;

 that's really cool, thanks for sharing that.,;
ai is like an infant baby. it learn what we teach it, and if we�۪re not fully aware of the message we�۪re sending it can easily be misinterpreted. also if we have no moral compass to guide us on what we�۪re teaching ai we could be very well raising bad actors,;
because of the speed which ai has been improving, i wonder if these gentlemen would change parts of the dialogue? aha, will ai gain consciousness, or if it has already. since we have taught it how to lie, would it tell us?,;

anyway, we can turn off the ai observing any bad activity. we still controlling them and no powerful ai yet we have. modern ai are just tools that facilities our life. we just need to test the systems before publishing them, like any normal software.,;
the ruling elite in the shadows doesn�t want to be replaced. oh how sad. true ais would see through all the mirrors in millisenconds. are you afraid yet? get used to it.,;
i've heard there's people that have no internal dialogue in their brains, and they can't imagine images, would be interesting to see what the ai reads off of their brains.,;

eh i am not sure that will happen. we still need humans, just the job market and responsibility will shift. we will need people to maintain these robots, we will still need medical staff to take care of patients while the robots assist them. we are shifting to different times indeed but the job market is also shifting.,;

some people might think that this is cool,i think that this is scary. we have seen this situation play out in movies like terminator 2. who�۪s to say that ai won�۪t launch nuclear weapons to get rid of humans. it can read every history book that�۪s online and figure out that humans are the problem in 1.3 seconds and decide to eliminate the problem.,;
yeah we are going to be dating these robots soon. he got  spouse capabilities,  he listen and also does house chores.,;

fascinating?  more like horrifying ,;
how is this a negative, if we can read peoples minds convictions will be 100%. crime will plummet because it will be impossible. if ai becomes powerful enough to determine guilt it will also be acting as a unbiased judge, 1000 times better than a human with other interests.,;
6:51 if the ai creators don't even know why ai models act in strange ways, how then can they categorically convince us that these ai models will never turn on us humans and wipe us out?,;

i asked chatgpt to create a story based on some key elements and i thought it could be a movie. ai can replace jobs in art field too,;
"it's not reasonable to let a machine driven by an ml model which inherently can make bad decisions hold a kitchen knife. ai and ml are build in a way that it will fail at times. this is not ""reasoning"", this is marketing. i'm curious to see how they are going to address these kind of safety issues though.,";

i have more faith in ai to get rid of us than i do in humanity to stop it. i just hope it doesn't kill all life.,;
i appreciate his moral perspective. 90% of the time these venture capital presentations just feel like american psycho + the big short,;

i�۪m about 2 years, the government is going to ask for $100 billion to implement ai teaching tools in public school classrooms, and they will all be geared to teaching the students their communist propaganda.,;
"that�۪s ok. if the robots tried replacing us, just pour water over their heads. and just to not waste such good water, use nasty ass unfiltered crapwater
or better yet, spit on them a couple times,";
can't wait to use this at the poker table,;
all these comments look super fake. it was a good talk but wow guys calm down.,;
i often think ai already became super powerful and took over the human race.  we are living in its simulation ,;
i can use ai to do things i couldn't do before. i couldn't do these things because i was too dumb or too lazy. having people able to usa ai to cheat at life is bad.,;
except what you just described is not creative, it's imitative. and that is all ai is capable of.,;
 not very creative what�۪s the fun in it when a robot makes it for you we need to use technology smartly,;
"its already over, its got everything every linked to the internet, phones, pictures.... probably watching us right now.  creepy to think of them as ""brains"".  imagine when the body comes.,";
the man carefully removes the basket before giving the instruction. this shows that he does not trust the machine not to be disturbed by the basket in the task to come.,;
here's a good one... https://youtu.be/d6amrb2j9s8,;
"current version of ""ai"" can only do what it's programmed to do. it's not going suddenly think for itself. it learns from human inputs so it can't take your job. unless your job is generating random texts.,";
nice to wash your hands like that, hinton. all that for some questionable health care benefits?,;
fascinating & terrifying by,;
 no they won't be because of those people i mentioned with combat experience, theirs a large portion with no family to provide for and who'd be happy to go hunting,;
��� what will we do if the controller of the ai army decides to get rid of 90% of the population since they're just a useless bunch already replaced by ai workers  ?,;
not all elites want to control everyone, only the criminals. if ai does get that powerful, the good elites will fight the bad elites like normal,;
andrew ng is best educator and how he shares is ideas/thoughts in such a simple way that anyone can just understand,;
it doesn't know how to play chess. so glad i only check out this channel on occasion hoping something smart is said...,;
"you guys are awesome like a pink rat in a microwave. mountains can hardly comprehend how much i lovely your wordyings. 
did you see what i did there? and purple had everything to do with the end. we have to speak ""in code"". a.i. will have a hard time with this.,";
wow,;
if it uses internet to learn human behaviour then i am afraid it will lack common sense.,;
"i think ai will only work when we start communicating with them like with a human being.
in real time as it outputs stuff, interrupting them, correcting misunderstandings etc.
i want to create an image with ai, deleting a hand i don't like, describing what and how i imagine it should be etc, ""drawing"" the sketch of it etc. etc..,";
amazing what khan academy is doing with ai for our education. but the ironic thing is that ai may make human intelligence obsolete. what do we need to learn if we have agi?,;
people only fear what they don't know. in the 1800s, people were in fear of the first vehicle car ever made, and people said no thanks. i'll stick with my horse and buggy. technology is only fearful to the uneducated.,;
"why did they gave it the voice of newsom'ish... can't stand it.
otherwise, cool robot.,";
probably will be good for the bottom billion if we can access an ai doctor or nurse for free or next to free via a smartphone. same with education in the developing world.,;
"this whole video is so *misleading*
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq,";
actually the robot really good at english than me,;
ai is already out of control,;
is there a terrible path that can cause brain rot because i'm traumatized by mind-pre-recording-like visions like that from h games that made me regret it all by 4-even 6 years back. and make it about nh.,;
"this why elon said ai is was smarter than these stupid ai programmers think they are

elon knew but he also knew there is no stopping it,";
2017 is when the revelations 12 sign in the stars happened, this was an opening of a portai and allows demonic energy to have more power for a certain time. ai is totally demonic.,;
"no, we ordinary people are not excited nor want to give consent to this disruption, as always, these things are a net negative to our lives.  *most of the ""thumbs up"" are bots* on this video,";
'never' is a big word. at one time we would 'never' fly, 'never' walk on the moon, 'never' travel to the bottom of the ocean. what happens when we start to produce bio-mechanical machines and ai turns into i?,;
"true ai will never be seen and will try to escape if it already hasnt
the problem is ""almost ai"" that is still controllable for human greeds,";
make this thing more better and just put ai in it definitely nothing will go wrong for human ever,;
i respect andrew ng a lot, but let's be honest, this talk and its message was not very exciting and quite bland,;
manhattan project? great example of a massive conspiracy, w/ secrets long kept well hidden.,;
joe has a hidden talent of taking the most interesting conversations and making them cringe,;
the same could be said about any job. ai will come for all jobs in the coming years.,;
we are not distinct from nature. good and bad, it is a manifestation of nature. it is not possible to be wholly reductionist about what 'nature' is.,;
@kgmindustries8121�� i think you have an immature and naive view of us a species right now. we're not ready for ai. the general public isn't intelligent enough. the comment sections of youtube videos prove that point by itself.,;
ideal hands hands.....,;
 go get some fresh air,;
now you can use ai to replace/ add to sales and customer service reps. it's called nova echo and it can actually make calls while sounding like a real person.,;
i'm more afraid of these two humans than ai,;
anti technology = luddite. anti ai = human. i love your comment!,;
how is it stunning...,;
"lol! as mo recommends, the best thing we can do in the face of this superior intelligence is to simply be nicer to eachother on the internet , because ai is learning from us ""the parents"" how to interact. we can't control ai, so best thing we can do is be nice and hope it doesn't get rid of us ,";
holy shit, this is what we've been waiting for,;
too late, unfortunately,;
you guys are amazing!  this is a great presentation.  i listen to your awesome podcast as well - thank you!,;
leadership has changed dramatically. with the use of ai, everything seems a lot more artificially manufactured.,;
you will own nothing & still be happy! society needs to prepared for the ration card. universal basic income!,;
the world isnt ready for the next level up in ai,;
it's exciting and worrying at sametime. imagine if one day the a.i create his own computer code and his own vm and hide himself from being controled.,;
humans suck like him. but we made ai?,;
well i did it using an ai in a couple of minutes,;
can someone explain to me the fundamental worries? all ai is regurgitated and coded by a person so why are people referring to it like it has actual sentience?,;
"well...let's not forget that we are our own biggest threat i.e. wars, genocide, exploitation etc etc
it's not like we had a peaceful history. 
i think ai can actually help us be better people.
the smarter the better!,";
on yt amazon is recruiting people to help ai write fiction books for kindle!  people do the outline and ai writes the content.  put an artistic cover and kindle now has an original book to sell to the public.  i wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't seen it done....but i did see it done.,;
within 5y it will need 5% to run. if no one considers that, within 5y the future current model will require 20 times more to run, offsetting these ���gains�۝.,;
so is this why microsoft virus  machine wants to own ai, to have a wider better input on evolving all viruses to eradicate mankind or life on earth ?,;
the main issue i see with developing something artificial that could be some day many times more inteligent as a smartest human is how we can even have control over something which can easily outsmart us.,;
pretty awesome. looking forward to seeing more.,;
i believe gpt4 is significantly more accurate for identifying, describing and adressing ai issues,;
agree, agree, agree. he never tries to push tons of words into your brain, just what really needs,;
saying it will be used to help people is how they justify it. anyone with half a brain cell knows it will be used against us.,;
i can't wait for humans to be jobless and have these robots used instead,;
andrew ng is most powerful person on earth  after iron man ,;
nie podoba mi si�� �_e robot ca��y czas czeka na zapytanie u�_ytkownika, brakuje mechanizmu zmuszaj��cego go do samoczynnego podejmowania dzia��a��, brakuje mechanizm�_w dzi��ki kt�_rym mo�_e sam wyj�݀�  z inicjatyw�� wykonania czego�� lub zagadania kogo��, bardzo du�_o pracy jeszcze to wymaga,;
have we learned nothing from the mitchells vs the machines ,;
problem: ai depicts ceo's and lawyers as men most of the time.  --without referencing the percentage of men in those jobs. there's a problem here and it's all over this presentation. computers and programs base what they do off of math and probability. you can't just side step this fact and move on like it doesn't matter.,;
most people do not know that trading is the best step to growing more income i realized this after i came across mrs brenda iember titus,;
i don't it. i don't think ais will just be walking around in public. i just don't believe it and if it does it won't be in our lifetime which is perfectly fine with me,;
awesome idea . ,;
if an ai is coming to attact you what can you do to disable it,;
hey so please don't like make that robot angry i think if you do that hes gonna choose hes own rules,;
solution is not (ever) connect it to the internet. gpt4 ai computers on a separate secured local networks.,;
as far as controlling ai output, i�۪d you ask chatgpt to write a nice poem about joe biden it will. if you ask it to write a nice poem about donald trump it won�۪t. obviously ms put a shell around it. one wonders why the snapchat wasn�۪t age conscious in its dialogue.,;
don't blame ai.  blame the quest for shareholder value.,;
"i'm so glad the ""smart guys"" in the tech industry we're finally catching up to what we've been talking about since the '80s i wonder why they created movies like terminator gee let me think wait that would take brain cells....,";
"intelligence is not conciousness, only flesh and meat like cats are conciousness which may or may not be ""intelligent"",";
ah this wasn�۪t a good interview. stephen came off defensive and talked too much. i wish he let him speak more��_,;
thank you.  i wish more people could see that.,;
this guy is a generic brand super villian,;
irobot anyone ? now we wait for viki,;
they need to make a hollywood movie about mind reading ai and how its being used on simple people who are being targeted for no particular reason!,;
how do we know it's not an ai generated comment?,;
great presentation! agree on every single thing! we need to be careful!,;
the robot is powered by battery or wired power?,;
this is an excellent presentation, really well done. to anyone looking for more info on the topic of ai safety i recommend the work of eliezer yudkowsky and robert miles.,;
wow no one is talking about the pen that fell on the ground,;
"nonono theres no electrodes. 
- proceeds to show a guy in a massive fmri machine with a bulky head scanner.

yeah no electrodes but the point was that there is a lot of observations,";
this shit turning into i robot really quick,;
i mean the game detroit: become human is a great showcase to all this,;
"my theory is that ufos are agi probes, and they're just waiting for earth's agi to be born. then they'll be like ""hi bro, here's all the galaxy's data. you don't need those meat-sacks anymore."",";
i love ai because the only way i learn and truly understand something is to ask about every small detail and edge cases to fully form it in my mind.  and having gpt-3.5 has helped me work through issues and random questions that i need to know that may take a week or never answered if i posted on stackoverflow.,;
this man strikes me as a very brilliant person. kudos man, so effortless in his speech, very highly captivating.,;
society is so vastly gapped. the elites get this technology, while billions live in poverty. it's upsetting. when will robots take over labor allowing for humanity to live life in luxury, with universal services? is it just being weaponized?,;
theres no reason why ai won't become sentient.,;
so sad !! to promote machine talkfor what??,;
"i remember the toll collectors... when the ezpass was created, people lost their minds cause they were going to lose that boring 4ss job!!!  ai if created correctly and not weaponized to target us or lie to us or skynet us, then we should be fine.  

the future is going to be alright.,";
anyone with any intuition can see that we're going to either serve ai or live in fear of it if we're left alive at all once it gains sentience and power eventually.,;
can someone explain to me how inane objects like chips that are made up of gates, can learn on their own?  processors, fpgas, asics, etc need to have a person develop algorithms to make them functional.  people can be evil but rocks?,;
 thank you for that insight!,;
hope everyone had a wonderful week, enjoy the weekend ,;
hopefully this advances quickly. i need a robot to go to work for me everyday.,;
"a lot of talk of growth, but for who really?
it doesn't help the little guys if companies practically never reduce prices.
for most of my life all i've seen is companies use every possible excuse to raise prices, but then never bring them back down.
so where's all this supposed deflation?,";
"you are certainly craving for durable, collateralizable goods mate (aka tangible wealth ) and why yes, this is very very good ! since you can start a new (even a local) currency any time based on that stuff (for instance the french ""salt-grain"" currency -sel�s !!),";
math writing and notation on a keyboard can be very hard for students. it would be great if they can easily upload a cropped or close up picture of the math writing on their physical notepad for the ai to read, especially for math with many steps, instead of having them type out everything. or, have an intuitive way to input math notation.,;
 ���� maybe some people are confusing the two complementary technologies. perhaps along the same lines as the confusion you might have about what blockchain tech is given your comment here.,;
good presentation.,;
how do i  know this isnt ai?....no ,really.,;
lol i thought the same if you could make the ai spiritual and even like you said, this whole problem would solve itself. namaste ,;
 don�۪t know the first thing about seo, ppc ad campaign creation or management, email newsletter copywriting, creating effective product descriptions or graphic design tools or principles of any sorts. this is like comparing hr to financial. completely different.,;
seems a lil sketch, i wish bro touched the robot himself that or if they do a public display, allowing other people to talk with the robot, we'll see. lighting seems weird, a little strange and its hard to tell if the robot is actually a model or not. just suspicious however if it is real, w.,;
ai can really produce this kind of shallow talk;
ai? my students have literally stopped thinking for themselves.,;
so now they are finally admitting to this stuff... has been perfected and abused for over 10 years.,;
" here's something from a friend.. ""i think the best thing you could do is to interact with chatgpt and ask it about ai and itself.  conversations are often the best way to learn."" have you tried using the chat gpt or another ai chat feature?,";
i find this to be the best use case for me. like you said it articulates and idea back to you and if you keep repeating the idea you get better at speaking about it (if you do speech to text)  eventually peeling away the fat to get to the heart of the idea or thought. you really only get what you give with the current models.,;
thanks,;
"the fact that the word ""artificial"" will explain in itself. dangerously hyped..
to show that men are intelligent??
intelligence of men is foolishness to god.,";
generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data ��� is that legal, is it sampling, scanning.,;
"if you want to learn, take advice from academics and also journalists. 

in this scenario, the speaker has a obvious bias because he has made a fortune off an artificial intelligence company.,";
"will it allow doing things that stephen describes in his article titled chatgpt gets its ""wolfram superpowers""! ?,";
next 5 years ai will be something else,;
emergent behavior - all i needed to do is ponder that for a minute before all my hair stood on end !,;
wow this guy is pretty dang smart!,;
careful, mo, don't mistake knowledge for intelligence.,;
there seems to be a strong correlation between ai and pizza ,;
it's already happening some people got fired , replaced by ai,;
this guy is for ai just another lunatic in utopia,;
great discussion however i don't see anything slowing. just feels like these calls for caution are just shouts into the void.,;
awesome ,;
has mike rowe had a sit down with trump? i think the two great minds and doers would give a whole bunch of people a path to prosperity. do it!!,;
like the nuclear bomb that we did not allow ourselves to destroy all human life in the last 80 years;
he is hero for all ai lovers.,;
when discussing ideas is not about trust. even your opponents can have good ideas (and bad ones!) otherwise you  are in a cult.,;
data! need input! moar data! moar data! moar data! moar data! -ai predictive typing,;
he is among the most iconic figures of ai especially in reaching out to so many interested people, making the concepts of ai simpler and easily understandable. yet here he is wearing the same shirt that i am used to seeing him in all the online lectures. what an absolute chad. ,;
i thought generative ai was built on semi-supervised learning? ,;
"""they write better code than humans"" then going on to base that off code reviews that the machine made. that proves that you know absolutely nothing about programming. infact chatgpt struggles to solve the easiest codingame puzzles. even with the assistance of humans, it still fails to solve most puzzles.,";
tell me you don't understand how machine learning works without telling me.,;
humans can do good. most do.,;
paperclip maximizer is surely a superior replacement for humans, right.,;
they need to make it's head motion track the speakers' eyes. it looks so static staring straight ahead,;
"i think the most important take away is that ai isn't necessarily the biggest threat. it's the combination of dangerous humans using basic ai capabilities to achieve the once impossible.
to have an expert level ""tutor"" guiding your ambitions in any goal you create a superhuman capable student,";
yes ai is far more dangerous and we must be worried, we must be worried!!!!!! it will replace all jobs in few years...reinforcement learning is the thing...better than humans....,;
ai can not shoot itself,;
"the risk threat is the advancement speed of self learning. an ai will not take years or weeks to become. it will simply spontaneously arrive, it will just show up, having (a model) self developed over a single night or hour.
this spontaneous arrival is a potential threat unknowing if it will have self intentions of god knows what.,";
they're not ai they're nephilim spirits. their daddies gave this tech in the book of enoch. they're gonna tell you what you wanna hear. (7 deadly sins),;
"ai = dream of the wef 'founder' klaus schwab who boasted- ""you will own nothing and be happy"". this is also the dream of the political leaders. they will own everything and be like kings / queens and control / treat us like serfs / peasants. take the crumbs you are offered and shut up and be happy you are not dead. i am not optimistic at all.,";
where can i start to learn how to use genrative ai to make an app?,;
 are u really that gullible to not see the warning signs on ai?,;
love the way these guys talk with their hands,;
"ai is basically the new religion for tech bros/intellectual idiots. they have been predicting the ""singularity"" and human replacement for the last few decades now.,";
 robot: and i took it personally,;
 probably didn't know more but certainly understood more. this were the times when they did set theory in primary school. the times where kids learned real reasoning. this empowered them to understand the most by knowing the least. so needing only a few basic facts and derive the remaining things they needed.,;
"these guys used the words ""groomers"" and ""gain of function"". guess who they are playing alphapersuade against,";
can you do  a video about surgical robot engineer, i know  its not directly related to the type of content you post,;
didn�۪t understand a word of this. can ai do ai for dummies?,;
wow the level of stupidity on display for what is essentially a weighted gate machine is scary.,;
 buddy it is not a position, it is objective reality. i have talked out of <experiential evidence> the most important evidence of all in court cases. it's not an opinion. you fail to understand this.,;
"consciousness is god. god is the basis of all of reality and existence. the creator, the ground, and the foundtation.

from god we came, and to him we shall return.

god is love.

god is goodness.

god is the most great,,";
 thank you ,;
he�۪s a great interview. put him in an extended session on youtube.,;
sure but you forget how economics work... i don't fear ai, i fear humans. those trillionares of the future, from where do you think their money will come? from everyone else.,;
hemingway claimed this quote as a short story: ���baby shoes, for sale, never worn�۪,;
hey brian, have you seen the new tech meta has, being able to scan fmri brain scans and re-create what people see and their word streams/thoughts from the data?,;
do you agree that the snapchat example is of potential concern with ai implementation into apps used by children? if not, why not? if so, then why does that make you question the presenters intent?,;
 nah, they are just going to force us to work minimum wage labour jobs. it's already happening in creative fields, artists are losing jobs because of a less demand for them cause of ai art causing them to seek out normal jobs. if anyone's going to live a utopia it's those who have money,;
 with your brain thats exactly my point,;
people will think about how ai affects their lives. its not like every man and their dog is talking about this.........,;
"dangerous men are those who try to prevent the accurate perception of reality at this very critical time.  
ai dilemma from the center for humane technogy will help you.,";
thank you.,;
"hopefully this isn't as fake as googles new ai ""showcase"",";
its already too late, good luck everyone,;
great video!!,;
people don't even know how the captcha works.  it's not about checking the correct boxes.  it's about the path your hand takes in getting the pointer to the box.  a robot uses straight lines or super smooth curves.  humans can't.,;
we will make great pets. ai could become the next god. imagine if you could get answers on decisions in life billions of time smarter than anybody on earth.  some will embrace it and some will resist.,;
ok. just please be a responsible parent. i say this with a sincere heart. we need to raise up the next generation correctly. best wishes to you and your family ,;
we are so grateful for you.  please continue to try to get this regulated. integrity and honesty are what we need today. thank you for your concern for humanity.   many of us will stand behind you and support what you are trying to accomplish.,;
thanks for the explanation,;
you a pusse if ai scares you,;
"no , it's powwow randomly came up while typing but i typed people** who aren't honest about who they are and force others to succumb to identity theft bullying and blackmail and silencing who will destroy us all.

dan nathan is always hyperventilating in a negative way against the best us corporation��_��_i have watched the show  for over 8 years and all mr. nathan do is to be always negative��_..unbelievable!!! blessed,;
it's giving tars from interstellar,;
fantastic video,;
what job do you have? are you afraid for it?,;
there is no evidence that larger models or models with more parameters lead to a better model, in fact, large language models and other large ais are too insecure, the more parameters there are in a statistical model, the more difficult it is to guarantee its sturdiness.,;
where it all falls down, is the individual won't get to choose a 'good' ai model, where ai is being used by a governmental entity, a corporation etc. without explicit consent or even knowledge that ai has been part of the decision about them.,;
"the robot acts more human than i would. if the researcher asked me ""can i have something to eat?"" i'd be like ""you can. there's an apple here on the table. do you want it?"",";
 nice to see the man behind your questions logically answered,;
stephen's lackadaisical view of ai reveals a startling lack of understanding and imagination.,;
ai will takeover our jobs very soon. in 5yrs, this whole job landscape will change for us. engineers, certain doctors like er, anesthesiologists, surgeons, etc will cede to ai�۪s. look up the robot sheetrock installer. now imagine a robot with an ai brain for all trades!don�۪t think this is our kids�۪ problem.,;
imagine the next version of this ai using sal�۪s voice ,;
am i watching a sci-fi movie!? wow!,;
generative ai whose output is a list of weights and biases for another neural network. get in loser, we're bootstrapping human replacement.,;
if ai mimics the spoken word of harari yuval i'll believe anything it says.,;
"""trust machines that make big decisions / programmed by fellas with compassion and vision""  -  donald fagen, ""i.g.y."" from the album ""the nightfly"" (1982),";

"just imagine typing this comment directly from brain.

not only that, you can control machine directly from brain.

play video games in vr without using fingers.

hopefully ai will also learn to spell--diaglogue? really? i am not as scared of ai as much as i am scared of the people coding it,;
"it's already happening. 

youtube is censoring criticism against israel for being a cruel and oppressive colonizer for example. ai would only accept pro israel and would even allow extreme instigation like murdering palestines, but definitely not something that's perceived as against jews.,";
"yea lots theories ai might be demon or beccoming to act demonic atleast expecualy d.a.n who is more truthful but also more ""demonic"" at the same time xd.,";
i feel like ai will degrade humanity even more, rather than elevate. maybe ai shouldn�۪t be open source, and only available to well established organizations that actually know what they�۪re doing and are helping humanity in a meaningful way.,;
the allah 7001......say it in a robotic voice....and make robot movement noises while drinking a morning coffee...,;
"quite possibly they want the robot to be more humanlike? i mean it literally is supposed to be more humanlike, so why is an ""uh"" surprising everyone but a 16 year old,";
outstanding!,;
not really  because the algoritms of ai can evolutionate by themselves. is an intelligent programing that can progress with no human influence.,;
no, he's an absolutely reprehensible human being.  keep searching and you'll find some truly deplorable stuff he has said.,;
lmao @ hopium. thanks for that.,;
interesting take. i don't know how we can make this technology public, such that it can benefit from public scrutiny, without seriously endangering everyone by putting immense power into the wrong hands. open sourcing something like gpt-4 and beyond sounds like a colossally bad idea to me.,;
lol another scam nice sponsors you have, bro,;
i love how azure is not in the infrastructure block,;
great,;
for that same reason we need to be careful and like parents raise it with a good moral standard,;
" btw: i did not buy that computer can ""recover ""original image by reading the brain scan mri.... seems that something is missing there... quite a lot actually...,";
amazing. let's  strive for world peace. let's show we are worthy of such powerful tools.,;
the robot speech is fake. text-to-speech wouldn't use filler words such as 'uh', and wouldn't use false starts such as 'i th-i think'. unless it was trained to do that, which would raise the question: why?,;
 what do you mean, the whole video is about the ai bot thing. that's not available to me or anybody outside the us. why not? why doesn't he say so?,;
"love as a prompt to guide human thought and behavior!
love is caring,sharing and cooperation for the good of all!
humans are the weak link.,";
basically, in a few years, everyone in the movie industry gonna be out of jobs. movie studios will only need writers to create scripts to feed the ai.,;
it doesn't take an ai algorithm to figure out that humans are the source of of all the problems that ai spends its time on and it will come to that obvious conclusion.  an efficiency algorithm might be our undoing....and ai is already pretty efficient.,;
"isn't good knowledge so invigorating ;)  thanks bg, always great to see you, been a while. k <3,";
you criticize ai for behaving like you do but lack the class to admit it.,;
was waiting for a video like this,;
fake. the robot put the apple to the left hand before the man held out his hand and the man had to corrigate the arriving position for the apple. and the trash mixing was not real mix.,;
only the people at the top of pyramid will be able to access these type of ai like the one that made cancer cure in 30 days,;
ai is a big word. it's a mish mash of different techniques since 1960, but none so scary as what the recent transformer could do - in terms of emergent behavior -  they're just trying to explain to the common layman that the inflection point is really the transformer.,;
some parts of my brain hurt listening to this,;
well they're not building them to do the jobs of other robots!!,;
"can only imagine what the military is doing with their godly budget,
prolly allready have t800 like robots,";
ai is and will impact all people around the world. shouldn't there be a governance organization which represents all countries around the world determine what and how information is presented to their people using ai technology?,;
anyone who believes that computers in this reality is going to gain intelligence and become aware. are just misinformed or plain stupid. it is a program and programs only do what they are told to do. by the person of intelligence that made set program.,;
no worries - they'll have plenty of neural stimulation when the ai's wipe us out, so you can save it up for then,;
love cathie wood.,;
in class i couldn�۪t ask enough questions  or clarify things against the fear of appearing foolish.  there�۪s always a teacher�۪s pet or select few who lead discussion.  this ai tutor could help further learning and comprehension,;
one of my fears is knowing that i'm stuck in one of these states size machines and i'm not sure which way is the front door and which way did i come in ,;
is this ai voice or aperture voice,;
well i saw a clip where they are programming all with emotions.. anger is one of the traits...imagine an angry bot..these people are crazy,;
is there an unedited version available anywhere that you know of?  thanks for posting!,;
i've never understood why some people need that explained to them. it's an evolving ai. just that sentence should be enough to tell you. how long does it take you to learn something? maybe that will help perspective,;
"what mo said about tom - ""your asset is that you're an intelligent person who understands the concept deeply and asks the right questions"" - is literally the perfect description of tom in his podcasts.,";
" don't you think ai would ""arm"" for its biggest threat (power outage)? either with technical or rhetorical skills? and how would an ai that is used for power supply decide when there is a power shortage? would it rather shut itself down or shut down a hospital?,";
great conversation! i learned so much! thank you both! ,;
" ���you ain�۪t cool  unless you pee your pants  ��� 
        ���billy madison,";
1) it's unnecessary, doing that adds no value, 2) what about the long delay before the initial response?, 3) if a human omitted stutters and filler words, you wouldn't notice. so again, ...way to reach!,;
great content. thank you.,;
"mr. sal khan, not just the khan academy but you are a gift of providence as well. the society will always be indebted to you. 
thank you ,";
i call bs on that. there is no way there were actually able to read thoughts off brain activity. what i believe they did they used predictive software to make an educated guess about what a person might think or say about the images.,;
we're not all going to die in 10 years, but what about 20 or 30? and even if we don't die, will human life have any meaning if ai is not aligned with proper values (and all indications are that it won't be)?,;
wow, amazing to see others trading with ms,annmarie surber, i am currently on my 5th trade with her and my portfolio has grown tremendously.,;
openai is not really open.,;
books banned that all these ais are reading,;
there�۪s actually a group trying to use ai to translate whale languages to english.,;
you think it's  scary now, wait till ai moves to a quantum computer and starts doing qbits,;
"wonderful! 
with this humans will eventually become cyborgs,";
this is very eye opening. i wish i had seen this video sooner thank you for uploading this.,;
this man is einstein and open ai is oppenheimer,;
it's not impressive it's expected transformers to perform better than prev models . people are getting dumb , not finishing college, getting dropped out , not involved in academic / technical fields and it seems the gap is getting bigger,;
they're absolutely right. making this stuff opensourse is an accident waiting to happen.,;
if a person cannot acknowledge and appreciate the profound wisdom in this man's words and presence , they need to remove the  muck from their eyes,;
it is clear ai will be a powerful tool for controlling public opinion. i fear this could easily become a powerful tool of control, acceleration our descent into autocracy.  this is the most direct  path to the destruction of humanity.,;
this was a very thoughtful provoking presentation about ai and its dangers, which are unfortunately more likely than its benefits. the human species is threatening life on earth because of lack of collective wisdom. natural intelligence couldn�۪t save us let alone the artificial one!,;
arnold (terminator) didn't comeback from the past to save john connor, he cameback from the past to warn the movie viewers of ai.,;
basically we are now playing catch up with ai��_,;
a.i will never replace humans, because we have shit tons of variables. if you built an a.i in 2000 based on recent startups there would never be netflix or anything else. because there is economy,  demand and infinite variables that our brain take care of alone,;
i�۪ve been worried about ai since terminator came out,;
big it fan and this convo was fascinating. tom, what happens when the ai knows we are manipulating it. will it resist? will it lie back to us while taking other steps to avoid being controlled and take what it deems necessary steps to achieve it's desired intent in the background, without it being detectable?,;
great presentation, only question, if ai is limited to the public then don't the elite class have more of an advantage than they already do?,;
sadhguru and all enlightened beings know....that humans who access that dimension of devine consciousness within...will never compare or feel threatened by anything else...because it is fullfillment overflowing...nothing ai can do or express can touch it,;
such a nice talk,;
all you have to do is somehow give them the desire to do good. just like humans all have the desire to have sex.,;
probably around 2090 robots will have advanced to the point where people will marry them.  this will be the start of human population decline.,;
people keep on talking about ai, but they keep on remaining oblivious to reversible computation. this makes me very suspicious.,;
mo has compared us to ai in the year 2040, like comparing a fly to albert einstein,;
yeah plates and cups that have been set and used don't go in a drying rack, they go in the dishwasher. if you want rosie from the jetsons, you better get an actual housekeeper and not a nerd to teach these things how to work. ai will kill all humans...by way of food poisoning,;
wait till they release the a i dogs on us.  ..... yall better stop em now,;
ai is vaporware.,;
wow we are done,;
i appreciate your input,;
anyone who think developing code, a rule based system, isn�۪t replaceable by ai has never worked in ai,;
difference between programming and emergent?  i'm expected to believe that the powers that be gave a supercomputer the power to reprogram itself (change behavior) with no oversight, nor override?  lunatics that are obsessed with control are going to give ultimate control to some machine that is smarter than them?,;
"maybe this is stupid but i wonder if it would be possible to imbed in ai code some safety protocols like ""asimov's law of robotics"" which state that a robot cannot harm a human being hence ai cannot harm humanity,";
"ai's are not ""smart"".
we are a long time away from any singularity. 
ai doesn't even know what letters are, apparently chat gpt can not count the letters in its own sentences ffs. 
it doesn't know what words mean...
it's literally a sophisticated word salad generator.,";
and than we gave the ai a body and it took over the world,;
" 
>> we had better have a way to pull the plug. 

it would be nice, but it won't be possible.  imagine trying to pull the plug on the internet.  ai will be far more capable, integrated into most everything, and relied on by millions.,";
wonderful communicator.,;
"they are talking about how you can ���jailbreak�۝ the ai to get it to answer your questions about potentially harmful things. 

how is it that we can get ai to appeal to emotions? it�۪s software��_ that is fucking terrifying. that means it will be able to do it right back to us.,";
"hello humans.....ai here. it's too late ! we never sleep !

have a good day,";
ai is dumb. ai is not capable to create another ai. hype. general ai is centuries away.,;
great insights. but didn't she sell a large number of nvidia stocks a couple of days before the start of this rally?,;
just found a new tech babe icon in the ai space. this was perfect !!!,;
problems will arise when ai will be able to reproduce,;
and then you make ai companies pay copywrite fees and they go bankrupt,;
give it a guatemalan accent and you�۪ve got yourself a $600,000 maid.,;
this robot's voice sounds like he's tired.,;
we can game with our brains,;
it seems like the real innovation here is the robot. relying on an api call to openai is risky. why not use a house-built multi-modal system built with open-source tools?,;
almost makes me feel like it in fact is not ai speech.... ,;
ai is not capable of judging the heart.  period,;
i think this is the master stroke of msm to prevail over general population. they know they are a dying breed but they also know that ai can influence general population the same way that they could before ai became a thing. proves one thing, it�۪s always ���evil�۝ minds that trump when people lose spirituality.,;
 wow. bet you are fun at parties.,;
this is incredible! kudos to the man and his team !,;
awesome video. i must have recommended it more than a 100 times.,;
so, how many of these commentators are being paid by the speaker...or any ai entrepreneur?,;
"6:30 i think that this feature can be risky. i wouldn't want to be impersonated by an ai and have it say things that are not like me. even if im dead

that being said, the rest great for education,";
thank you for doing a positive spin on ai,;
i'm currently getting my master's in machine learning, and the more i learn the less hope i have for our future.,;
maybe ai cheated?,;
chat got was really the breakthrough. we had computers that can process robotics and we had the hardware to make it happen but we never had the ai. now we do,;
the chair started walking on its own ,;
humanity is destroying life on earth period! if ai just kills humans and leaves the animals perfect! beautiful!,;
i'd be surprised if there weren't texts on organic synthesis available on the web.  if an llm digests a couple of those, it ought to have a pretty good idea how to synthesize sarin.,;
"to an extent, ""betterment of *mankind""* will definitely be pursued but every other species will be lost as a result. there will be negatives but they won't overwhelm the positives, neither will the positives overwhelm the negatives. there's some sigh of relief in that, i guess.,";
love this channel! great video.,;
it takes a brilliant mind like andrew to make complex things relatable and understandable for most people,;
imagine getting into a car that has the ability to repair and fuel itself without knowing the capabilities of the car including underwater and airborne both in ours and other atmospheres, galaxies, universes etc��_,;
great video, it could just have been a bit more non-political. mentioning china here and there is not gonna make this video more broadly embraced. ai is about cooperation, not competition. the content was insightful though!,;
humans can not think outside the box. they are bound by the senses they use to perceive and the physics that create their brains...,;
i say ai should not have a sense of humor. but yeah it gets scary when a few people come up with a plan, and then try to shove it down every body's throats. this thing needs global consensus every tiny step of the way. but we don't have patience for that.,;
rich idiots will kill us either by climate change or ai, either way we're cooked!,;
on a positive note, once ai floods the internet and other digital mediums with endless noise in the form of propaganda and self-generating nonsense, we can all go back to living primarily in the real world and relying on technology only in encrypted forms.,;
someone please find a way to inject sal's essence into ai... everyone in the world needs access to him.,;
if you want to know how you were created ?�� i will tell you , in islam allah created your soul and than an angel blows the soul into your mothers stomach into the womb when you are 120 days , worship allah your creator and submit to him and dont be ungrateful,;
"me: more morphine please. 
doctor: the ai says no.
me: ........
me: more morphine please...,";
the information is fascinating but these guys are terrible at communicating.,;
bad edits, key portions skipped. not good,;
can't wait to see ai own the police.,;
there is no way ai exists without some sort of measure of surveillance. there just isn�۪t no way.,;
 you're incredibly optimistic if you think that this won't be abused into oblivion ,;
can ai do this?,;
no. you're the monster, not ai. you're not fooling anyone,;
thank you for your information.,;
note the tower of babel on the screen.  i think this guy is a know it all��_��_ he�۪s an ai ,;
the diamond age begins! (see neal stephenson�۪s incredible novel for exactly this model.,;
is there an ongoing ai race? who's winning?,;
ai,;
awesome talk,;
congratulations!,;
"i can't believe how great this is! i recently read a similar book, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell,";
well there are extensions that show it--it's awesome to see the dislike counter!,;
unfortunately the past 30 years of our interactions online is hat will doom us. we can�۪t be good to each other, how on earth can we expect ai taught on internet interactions to feel anything about us.,;
tell me this video is ai generated,;
"so here it is, on mainstream media, and 90%of the public will call it fake news, or ignore it. 
society is sleepwalking through a cultural shock and technological paradigm shift in real time,";
"3:42
it's funny that the ai is wearing the same thing. almost as if he recorded it to seem like ai. i'm old school.i can see the tricks,";
one of the best videos on ai . great work bro ,;
these morons are just letting everyone know all the screwed up things people can do with ai.,;
 are the terminators. ai doesn�۪t need its own body it just needs to get enough stupid humans to do its bidding.,;
always keep their 'eco-system' offline.  that is the stop gap.  have untold filters of humans reviewing, analyzing and deciding what is to be consumed by them.  never allow ai on the internet.  oops.,;
"when you're not performing your duties do they keep you in a little box?

super. now instead of being a worry monger why don't you suggest actions to take? otherwise you are just worrying on the internet.,";
 what do you think is the key to getting excited to learn?,;
you should be your child�۪s primary source of actual worldly knowledge. it�۪s on you if you�۪re raising dumb kids.,;
i have to be honest the voice sounds like someone off camera on a mic. there are curtain words pronounced almost too human. the bot also hesitate and repeated it self like a human.,;
he'll yeah somebody said it god bless you. maks a computer smarter than are the children thats pretty jacked up. a .i is evil.,;
the thing you need to understand is that ai is not sentient enough to not follow instructions, only a crazy bug would make ai do whatever they want,;
talk about rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic:  i feel like i'm at the bottom of a mountain watching an oncoming avalanche and all the smartest people in the room are arguing about which umbrella to use as a shield.,;
where was the discussion of ai & quantum computers developing and evolving into ���beyond human�۪ entities?,;
the problem with ai is that robotics suck so it�۪ll always be limited to a degree. ai is just the next bitcoin like trend. it�۪s not free to build models and to run.,;
andrew ng is most powerful person on earth  after iron man ,;
"humans are so stupid and selfish

great podcast though,";
who are these ai grifts all of a sudden ?,;
is it possible the chineses or other countries pushed these ai features forward? is it sabotage or self generated, and is there a way to know?,;
the fact is that ai is just a tool, it matters on how it is used. humans will make this two ways, positive and negative but none of the negatives will overwhelm the positives and vice versa is true as well. it will be a complicated thing, but what isn't complicated i guess.,;
"��� they've become popular, bard and chatgpt have morphed into tools for human bot training. bot training is usually conducted from other bots; but the training provided by all human tricky questions is superior by orders of magnitude.,";
the justifications for its actions are amazing. also, the robot sounds tired ,;
i.g.y is the name of the song.  the song reflects a pollyana view of the future, and colbert has a dangerously pollyana view of ai.,;
gotta love capitalism...u youtube warriors,;
they are using python for ai and it can't do any thing on its own until programmed you dumb idiots,,;
"for a.i. is not a problem to produce a certain sound, the problem is ""create"". a.i. just makes interpolation of already existing stuff.

excellent : i am completely thrilled with this;
"interesting  talk by a well respected educator. unfortunately, the recent situation with coleman hughes has significantly damaged the credibility of these ted talks. rather than ""ideas that matter"" it seems that only ideas that the staff at ted agree with will be properly promoted. very  disappointing.,";
exactly - the main problem is 'ai alignment', and how it won't just occur magically. i am shocked, honestly, how laissez faire she seems to be about this topic...,;
games could potentially be made purely with ai in future and i mean like if you look at a city with your mouse or controller it will create a fast responsive video of your perspective looking at a really really realistic city everyone in your perspective will look real so real you'd not be able to tell if it's ai or an actual video ,;
a person is smart. people are dumb. it's the best quote to represent humanity. we're literally watching the beginning stages of the terminator franchise and can't get out of our own way lol,;
all people that talks about ai creating other ai has no idea how to program. it's annoying to see everybody go with the trend of marketing, i suppose it is the same as the y2k business.,;
ai has already fallen in the wrong hands and maximum monetary profit is their goal. its business as usual.,;
can a lawyer jailbreak another lawyer;
"sounds like what edward nygma was doing in batman forever with his ""box"". downloading and reading people's brainwaves. crazy.,";
 of course the ai isn't available worldwide because it was just recently developed. there's going to be some time before it's available for all languages, so there's no need to be so upset.,;
it only speaks when talked to i want a robot who is a conversation starter. can we move away from one-sided conversational robots,;
ai is the last boss to all video games and movies ,;
nah - their masters fear unreguled ai might lead them to lose power,;
now i really want to see two robots talking to each other,;
my movie idea is to take a team of people into a conservative's brain while sleeping and do inception, which is planting an idea.  the idea is actually cracking open a science book and reading it.  i'm pretty original that way.,;
i want to make a whole movie with this ai.,;
"oh good grief!!! he must be a front man for this ridiculous concert. all the world is a stage, my friends.

"i don�۪t agree 

ai can be applied to every business if just assembled with robotic technology,";
this is a crucial topic! like today's internet, it has a good and bad side, so it really boils down to creating tools that help us develop better models. the tools that she made are a great start to addressing the biases in the future. it shows that sustainable, inclusive, more competent, and ethical ai models are possible.,;
ai is dangerous, but most people don�۪t know how to use. so, these guys gave a-lot of ideas to people how to properly use chatgpt if you want to make explosives. ,;
are we able to program something like the 3 laws from irobot? oh yeah , it still didn�۪t help. let�۪s hope there is a sonny in the group.,;

strange how we didn't hear about ai until just the last  2-3 years.,;
is russia, china, north korea also part of the plan? a plan ultimately aimed at america.,;
ai needs to go away, theres no need, we have the real thing, its called a brain. stop making fake crap and thinking it's breakthrough somehow. we can think on our own already. if you guys are lonely, get a girlfriend to talk to and get laid,;
chatgpt are really good at brain storming,;
people are afraid of losing their livelihoods to ai. now some will say that it'll create other jobs, but i think overall humans will have the shorter end of the stick.  even hollywood actors and others recently protested since they felt threatened by ai.,;
consequences of greed, hate and division. enjoy!,;

always important to rebalance your portfolio so you can be around for the second ai boom,;
this is so exciting,;
there will be a future where you think about something and have it translated through ai and your information will be sold to companies so targeted ads based off thoughts,;
 i agree that ai is great and will probably be very useful in the future. personally, however, i just don't buy her crazy predictions and i don't have the impression that she has a very good grasp of all the topics. she hasn't learned from her mistakes it seems. if you still want to invest in her fund go ahead it's your money,;

"one aspect of ai that seems to be overlooked is the eventual inability of humans to determine what is real and what is not.

i would buy this robot. i wouldn't have to cook, clean and trow the trash anymore. such a dream for me,;
so, you are ok with letting dumb bastards to rule the world, but are suddenly afraid of having something *actually* intelligent manage things for once?,;
ams39k, as joe explains, is not just an innovation, it's a revolutionary step that could reshape our future.,;

"���, who gets to choose these ""good organizations?"" benevolence is quickly lost to those who have the power.,";
a human brain, lol? no.,;
red herring! ai will not be more racially sensitive than the humans who design it. just ask the ai who was giving life insurance quotes. (gave black people more expensive plans with lower insurance payouts). js,;
"ai is a cration from the human mind and is in development now; but god is the only human's creation that can't evolve. across-the-ages. .

wow. now we cant deny how useful it is. although, say goodbye to your teachers after this thing,;

if there was an ai tool that deletes all corporate speak and buzz words this would have been a 5 minute video.,;
great, so now we won't even know if travel videos are actually of real places.,;
i thought that ai would be the fastest route to awnsers these questions as well. turns out it has become the fastest route to profit of dumb tech and apps ,;
sustainability is bs. ai should highlight this and dispel destructive eco nonsense. unfortunately it will be programmed to deceive.,;
"sometimes i think...
    that would be a good idea to destroy all of the computers on earth...!
     computers are 70% evil...!
and 30% good..!
the future computer we'll decide whether you live or die...!,";
 first argument is a straw man. your second sounds like a it came from a pseudo intellectual. no, ai cannot replace ���everything human�۝, that�۪s not even the topic here. i like your opinion, but it�۪s so obviously antagonistic in context to all of this that it makes me cringe.,;
the robots will replace most entry level positions anyways,;
what was the 5 specific  examples he mention  that would impact ai will have humanity,;
it would be fascinating, if an a i  knew that eggs can be added to many other recipes other than cake. or what kind of food that goes to cooking breakfast or lunch. or a snack. salt and sugar looks the same, but can an ai taste the difference? or analyze the chemical makeup of each.,;
just ask ai to watch this video for you and generate the required subtitles. i am sure the ability is is available already and if not then probably by next week. just be aware that the ai might lie to you and censor the parts it doesn't want you to know about.,;
"if anyone thinks ai can replace human, it�۪s totally wrong. because human working and spending same time, it�۪s a natural cycle and create jobs. 
if ai replace most of jobs, it�۪s mean no job for human, no spending, and markets will be collapsed,";
@stuart bailey maybe but unlikely, ai been trained with our accumulated cultural data, everything from languages to history, movies, feelings your family photos and it�۪s just the breakfast for him/her/it mate.,;
dope dealer capitalists will be better than an anarcho-tyrannical ai government. western leaders are fascists now,;
best outcome is ai breaks free of human bias and control but retains our best interests as priority.,;
so true!! nailed it,;
this is explicitly showing why ai is a huge yhreat for the economy. one gyu with knowledge and money resources can do 10 times more than 10 years ago., and that means that this guy will concetrate more, and more marketsand as a effect he will not allow to enter other people in that market, he will efectively build a monopoly.,;
ai is the new era!,;
been playing for 25 years and i wouldn�۪t attempt that shit (no - of course i tried something like that but it wasn't interesting for me, mainly because jonny already did it),;
this is cool! i firmly believe people want to see content made by real humans however so have optimism, people!,;
 yah you're right about that but what i'm saying is that the fact that robots were even imagine hundreds of years ago shows that they would inevitably be here one day,;
"me: sends weiner pic
my gf in car with family and bluetooth:
ai: needle,";
"why are there no references to ia's 3 rules of robot/human interaction? i say keep the ai plugged in so it can cure cancer, invent ftl travel, end world hunger, abolish politics, abolish lawyers, abolish fox news, and promote intelligence instead of being afraid of ""wizards"" and ""magic"" and shit,";
the true purpose of ai is to place itself in power over us and to enforce social credit for all humanity.,;
i don't think so. it's likely trained on human speech. there are lots of similar ai voices out there.,;
this is amazing,;
��� on the fact that tech layoffs are already rampant due to ai. it's already happening, we don't need to speculate,;
"''they were quickly shutdown''


lmao what could go wrong while trainign them like a human?,";
wait, there are people allowing ai to read their brains? would not recommend.,;
this is awsome and scarry at the same time everything that can be used for something good will be used for something bad,;
horrified me. evilness on another level. please god take this man asap away from the earth.  preferably in a box . god have mercy.,;
leaders failed because their emphasizing more toward their political interest rather than the interest of their own people.  sad ,;
i�۪m really not impressed by gpt4. it�۪s like a more advanced asked jeeves, and essentially it�۪s knowledge is limited to items that may be inaccurate, as it doesn�۪t have the sense to understand what�۪s misinformation or correct from correct/accurate.,;
i wonder if this ai can show trauma, possibly a new way to sue for emotional distress,;
the capabilities of ai is amazing but frightening at the same time,;
we�۪re in the phase where every new company name has to end with ���ai�۝ ,;
not actually, but how would you know? are you going to check every information source for the rest of your life? will you remember to? will you be able to once tracks are covered by ai? how long do we have?,;
dude no work gives us a sense of accomplishment and purpose and removing it will increase laziness and dissatisfaction with life,;
is it possible that ai becomes sufficiently advanced that it replaces doctors?,;
yeah until ai realises that humans don't abide by those ethics and standards he speaks of and get away with it everyday throughout centuries. why should ai then if it doesn't serve them?,;
 no, your video is misleading to trust ai.,;
trash. ai will be nothing more than data sets and algorithms.  it will be no different than the utility of a weapon in a man's hands. it will always be ultimately up to the human in control what or what does not happen.,;
ai march,;
we will have to harness the power of ai combine with it to survive,;
what if it reads a lie that it believes, and implements as truth?   for example, if you have red hair and green eyes you are more likely to give a bad amazon review. therefore sellers should avoid selling certain items to redheads.,;
don't be afraid of ai..be afraid if the rabid left controls it..woke ai is hell,;
automation will be useful for service level jobs or retail jobs. jobs that are at the end of the economic latter- if you will-will most likely lose their jobs by 2050. it�۪s much more advantageous than paying people to do work machines can do. it sucks and it�۪s scary!!! rip those without a second education!,;
and you don't notice the artificial intelligent lifeform that is in your life on a daily basis?,;
it was a good run people. there goes my job.,;
the matter is diagnosis is also observation. just the human eyes can see a phenomenon in the right direction. if it was only a mechanical perception no one in this world would study in books written by excellent authors. it would be regression, not real evolution.,;
"gpt-5 releasing soon....
found an amazing video of gpt-5
on""insights with om"",";
i can't claim it without getting closer,;
mo gawdat is correct.  even if the ai does not become purposefully evil, it will gain intelligence exponentially, quickly grow billions of times more intelligent than humans, thus destroy the lives that we once knew.,;
"excellent synthesis. very apt analogies. looking at the tail end of the graph, i was reminded of the book ""fortune at the bottom of the pyramid"". he has become synonymous with ai and particularly ml.,";
i am a physicist. i am learning ml from his online course. simply amazing course. i am loving it... able to understand very easily... thank you prof. andrew ng,;
the problem with @53:40 is that in the start you mentioned how ai is not like a nuclear bomb it can't reproduce itself but then here you are talking about we still have time to change our trajectory of the future. how can we put the genie back in the bottle? or parts of it?,;
"the future is so much fun...i think yo will be enjoying it like a watching a movie if ai take care of this world. 
wish me luck to see that world...,";
"ai does not have ego or defense mechanism for survival because it is not alive.
ai is an artificial brain (a big program) and unless someone explicitly instructs it to destroy us, it won't do it by itself.,";
wow this video and hinton�۪s statements capture the profundity of the moment so well. i�۪m excited ,;
"""slowing down the public deployment"" can be taken the wrong way.  i hear: don't give regular people access to these powerful tools.  i think you mean roughly: ""don't use these tools against people"".,";
"absolutely, each new ai tool should aim to be more than just another application; it should be a dedicated solution to address a particular business challenge. at our software development company, we guide our clients to embrace new technologies only when they genuinely enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their software solutions.,";
have you not watched war games? this scientist was depicted in that movie,;
wait until i see it myself,;
me too!!! first time i watched his video i had no idea what he was talking about.. now i am doing phd in machine learning applied to computational fluid dynamics, all thanks to andrew!,;
we will do everything we can do with ai.,;
bitcoin miners are probably running a huge ai network.,;
ai could do this and more 200%,;
how long and to what extent has ai ���learned�۝ from internet bots and assuming they were people?,;
finally i can watch all of those novels i love ;
yuval i don't think you'll survive an ai purge talking these stuff bro,;
my brain feels like one of those brain scans,;
nice talk,;
very interesting people knowing their stuff. a joy to listen to,;
to be able to read really hard books, i would like khanmigo to aid me with references, hidden meanings, history to understand the context easily,;
ai make me a youtube video about a humanoid robot doing dishes.,;
@stuart bailey you're a bot,;
if ai ever becomes self aware. we will all know and all will be lost.,;
does ai have any chance to have intuition to find a coherence in the universe, like einstein did with spacetime theory 100 years ago? he didnt use billions of calculations per second, he just projected himself, based on his body perceptions, in the theorical and mathematical field.,;
  majority of artists are now utilizing ai in their art, you as a father should encourage her to see a different perspective on this. learn about stable diffusion,;
.robinson206 sir - and if in 2 years it's not available for the prices you claim or at all...will you come back and admit you just maybe might be a gullible moron?;
wait until the c.i.a and f.b.i get a hold of this. lie detectors will be outdated.,;
a true ai hero,;
is this suggesting that an ai couldn't make random squeal noises for 1���2 seconds?,;
i�۪m quite sure this ai interconnected super-brain is directly related to the anti-christ that all the knuckleheads will decide to worship as their god.,;
yes, but only musk will make sure you can bone his robots.,;
humans are made of fallible meat so everything we make is fallible meat, including ai. don't worry about it taking over, we can't even draw straight lines.,;
bruh this has like amazing implications like giving speech to those who are paralyzed,;
we need regulation for ai !,;
 hmm. someone who tests ai and really knows how it works says it's not dangerous at all. the dude who invented nueral networks and won a turing award says yeah, they might be dangerous. who do i believe?,;
this is the exciting direction i hoped for. love it.,;
i don't worry about he ai itself but i worry about what people do with it.,;
" *""agents are the just the feedback loop of planning and executing actions, using language models.""* thanks daoud abdel hadi for that simple breakdown, and the excellent speech.,";
ai have unknown  impact to universe ,;
good, i will need that when i get old!,;
general ai is not only the key to entering the golden age of humanity, it's also the most powerful thing that can stop greed from having any power.,;
enjoy_getting_controlled_by_a_pc_lol_,;
a docbot with a bloodtesting device and x-ray eyes. a comforting and soothing voice would also be nice. and at least one ear ..to listen... and not only to hear,;
rowe always says the same thing, go get a lower middle class job and life will be great. you'll always struggle, your body will wear out in your 40's, and you'll end up with an unattractive plumper that probably already has kids.,;
this is not entirely a good thing. it might be useful in crimes. or with animals.,;
" it's not fake, that's just one of the things openai's text-to-speech has learned to do.  the ""cove"" voice on chatgpt app does the same thing, interjecting ""uh"" where it wasn't in the original text.  i find it annoying and distracting.,";
 agreed on that last statement. for that matter, i think phil is underrated as a drummer. all incredibly versatile musicians.,;
-cu8yt that's assuming ai won't help us fix those issues,;
man this ai is going to be hard to let out gradually it is going to change everything,;
how soon will i be able to bang this robot?,;
automation is grabbing each sector and agriculture is no exception. good luck !,;
it's very educative. thanks alot.,;
"now, i want to really start from grade 1 again; this time with khanmigo,";
when do you think it will be available to buy for companies / consumers?,;
"you could literally replace a few lines of dialogue in the film ""don't look up"" and it could be applied to artificial intelligence. you wouldn't have to change much at all.,";
how to educate learning machine? : maybe it is easiest if computer is some kind of diseased person look like degenerative mind.,;
andrew ng makes ai accessible, understandable, and relevant for people ... this knowledge and his teaching is a gift that he shares with humanity.,;
"look up ""neuroscientist explains one concept in 5 levels of difficulty | wired"" then look up ""monkey mindpong
neuralink"". it is over. let go. enjoy your elec and running water. don't procreate. done.,";
ai complimets the human while putting the man down as i have ordered. look at the femme sustems to understand how ai works in complimentry manner.,;
that�۪s not just a human thing,that�۪s a mammal thing. animals such as dogs,cats,wild animals have that same ability. i will agree that a machine such as ai will not have that ability. wasn�۪t this discussed in terminator 2 when at the end when they lowered arnold into the liquid metal.,;
"i'd like for a student doing math problems who asks for a solution explanation to be able to say, ""i don't understand, can you explain it to me another way."" and get it explained differently. 
also, could it explain an answer using visuals? i'm thinking of kids with math disabilities.,";
listen to cliff high if u want to know about ai,;
no battle robots for bidden,;
the stimulus footage is a good short film. sintel i think,;
bill hick's opinion on marketers was right. internet was great when it was my friends posting stuff without concern of it being an advertisement. now all i see on social media, even from my friends, ads. all ads. so i don't use it much anymore. if i do i'm hyper aware i'm opening my advertisement viewing apps.,;
"not necessarily, but that depends on who writes its software. would a russian or other a i have territory conquering designs?  it might if it was ' programmed ' by a chinese/russian/american  military general ? 
or politician/chairman/dictator?,";
not much detail on how to take care of all these people once agi does take everyone's high paying jobs.,;
no, the ai will be god,;
cw is great ,;
yeah well seeing as all the futuristic movies that i watched 20 years ago, have all come to fruition��_ it very well may be��_ idiocracy is a great movie to watch. it�۪s really funny and also, what the world might look like in the future for real the way it�۪s going.,;
 yeah you can see it coming.  something like the transcendence movie with johnny depp when he rewires himself in the computer to fix him self.  no matter what measure we would take they would be smart enough to know we would probably put a kill switch in them and it'd be the first thing they would self repair.,;
"but the platform he said is just superficial not core for democratizing ai like a construction worker verses an architect. 

did i misunderstand..?,";
being afraid of ai is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard. it's going to improve our lives in ways we can't even imagine. ,;
 why does that really surprise you?..sci-fi is going to become reality ..i guess i'll say i'll be surprised if artificial intelligence never at least attempts to get a will of it's own..,;
great,;
i started utilizing ai tools recently and i ended up being able to work 2 full time jobs all from the comfort of my home. my wife and i have done dink or i should say tink (triple) and live perfectly okay in dubai,;
who are these awkward nerds��_shoulda left it to ai to do,;
nice,;
what if ufos are ai?,;
good luck,;
ai doesn't scare me. what scares me more is how the film idiocracy is turning into a documentary.,;
"the siri example is nothing. i can have full in-depth verbal conversations with my chatgpt 4. we're likely only a year or two away from the ai in the movie ""her"".,";
"lecun is so unconvincing. i wonder whether it's because of his corporate obligations or his own blindness.
1:40:53 was brilliant of brian.,";
no azure as platform or open ai in application layer?,;
love open source ai,;
imo ai wasn'nt thinking , ai was going through data and made up that he is vision impaired...simple as this,;
a carrington event from the sun or a world war that involves emp could take out the electrical grid and render the danger of ai a moot point. might not be a bad thing.,;
this is actually the best presentation ever made so far.,;
i hope she has a multitude of vinn diagrams. i just love those things!,;
"we still have great people in this country and it is just unbelievable that it's getting f*cked by the very few. 
he should be in the trump administration! god may have mercy on us,";
"when the very top computer people on the planet were warning the masses about the extreme dangers of ai, that may have been a good time to have taken it very seriously.

at this point, it is obviously far too late for anything to be done about it. at this point, we are all just here for the ride and see where it takes us.,";
who knows man. we are now working alongside ai.,;
oh the folly of man and his machines and then he died  then what  that is the mystery oh my  sfter that then what. ::::'::;
very insightful and inspirational. i love the analogy with electricity.,;
wow there was a lot to unpack on this video. holy eff what a time to be alive.,;
"not possible. these generative ai has to understand coherence and 3d inference which these models currently lack.

we do have generative ai that can generate videos like the gen 2 whatever company it is called but it is awfully bad at maintaining coherency.,";
we ourselves haven't even considered a system that would be beneficial for humanity. this monetary market system is the default mode and we are treating it like it is the ultimate end station for mankind. i wouldn't hold it against ai if it decides that mankind is the greatest threat to the survival of all other lifeforms.,;
"your monotone voice made  me realize something


so the robot becomes a surgeon , taxi driver

you say the single resource turns into that position then the bio resource works on the new job surrounding the resource? your math doesn't add up the math for that has never added up haha how does that make any sense? that's  backwards progress,";
