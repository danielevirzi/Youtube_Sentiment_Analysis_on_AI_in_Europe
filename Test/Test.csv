0,replace all the congress people with ai
1,even your card skills be replaced by robotics soon
2,i more concerned about issue that is not as addressed one thing that makes humans humans is art ai can and has already started to use algorithms to create art that is not human but near human
3,it s not as important which jobs be replaced it s how many our economic model has a threshold for unemployment and ubi present a whole new layer of complexity to a generation of dissociated undereducated people and the longer it takes for folks to admit this the longer it s gonna take before we get to enjoy it
4,i know ai iverson the answer
5,i m glad ai is making breakthroughs biology that lead to possible cures the future it s a good thing we live a society the prioritizes a person s well being over profiting to treat their sickness
7,i figured out how to fix the ai problem we all stop doing stuff the ai is trained on us if we just stop humanity all together and all chill our homes we should be good
9,did you invent the culture that you follow nope did you invent the clothes or style that you adhere to nope did you invent the words that you use or cleverly come up with using internet memes nope do you know anything past the current life you are now living nope even those of you that have had spiritual or otherwise epiphanic experiences that may not be as common as what you are surrounded by did not invent nor create those experiences reset you say you have already been reset when you become satisfied is when you carry with you the wisdom of what seems to be rather impossible now excuse thee i must go fart and throw random unicode characters at your goofy ai technologies
10,this effect everyone even if it doesn t directly effect your job just think of the millions of people that be flooding the available job market it s not just gonna be what he said it s gonna be all the truck drivers mailmen welders the list goes on this cause a great depression type situation if not checked there be many people unable to find work and the work force that is needed be over saturated they won t have to pay anything to have workers
14,i foresaw this years ago and earned interdisciplinary qualifications ai law
15,ai and robots never replace real intelligence and real creativity all it can do is copy what creative humans have already created it is useful but it cannot create original thought and it is not god i a retired baby boomer and i don t really care what the hell happens
18,people who are afraid listen to this the source of information of ai is the internet hence it can only be as accurate as the internet itself do you think internet is all correct all the time infact ai generated content pollute internet more
19,you didn t even talk about the main jobs rather you just talk the same sh t
21,i like to point out that a targeted ai can be designed to do one thing better than humans while being totally unable to do other things human level ai is coming way before agi is ready it replace some jobs enhance others and accelerate the pace of everything it touches
23,just hoping ai replacing jobs would make people more inclined with things that cant be replaced by ai or bought by money like natural resources i believe we all have the ability to be self sufficient but the superficial goals presented by high paying jobs or corporate life
24,great now i m stuck infinite rat race training for skills that ai hasn t taken yet then i train new skills that ai hasn t taken yet then i train new skills that ai hasn t taken yet what s the point of this society anymore
26,and the first ad you broke for for guess what ai
29,endless to say if ai took the iq test they are pretty much going open text book vs a human without open text book people believe anything now days
30,sora ai make a video of someone do card tricks
33,humans need to get creative oh wait ais can get creative
34,the last option that be remain our hand is going back to agriculture
37,basically ai indeed replace coders it s just that it won t completely replace them there be some left but run of the mill programmers get laid off unless you try to stay on top
43,everybody is afraid of it then why people keep using it like ban ai from the whole world tell the tech company not to release any more ai boom problem solved
44,it won t happen sadly because of the large companies get more money that way because now they can reap off people without even hiring them first and they employ a large audience of short sighted people who loves this new technology and can t see they are helping bring their own unemployment faster
45,i sure there be a boston dynamic style robot with good enough fingers to do that card tricks at the beginning of the video soon enough
47,ai is just a mirror of humanity the real problem is human greed and ignorance there would be no job shortages if people didn t try to choose the quick and easy way by replacing people with ai and because the technology is new it ll take some time until they realize the real pitfalls of using it excessively it ll depend on the industry of course but the called hallucinations only be the tip of the iceberg a lot more happen and the companies who jump on the band wagon without realizing what they re doing drop below zero very fast the aftermath entire economies could fail if the creation of new jobs isn t prioritized
49,awesome cardistry
51,meanwhile chat gpt fails to answer simple questions one year after release
53,i think we need to be talking right now about the system that can replace the rampant monopolistic capitalism we see today it be a fight sustainability organized by ai be absolute but shouldn t we all be included decisions that mean we may not be able to have children for reasons of not causing miserable existence through lack of resources and that we need to protect wildlife and natural beauty from rampant capitalistic monopoly
56,you own nothing and be happy about it keep voting guys
57,i don t think it replace any job that needs critical thinking skills no where the near future there be a prompt that says chatgpt create a business plan where i make 1mm selling hats there always be element of humanity and randomness that exist the world making ai useful but unable to replace the humans who create it
59,who is the us it s up to us to teach ai this is the cartoon vacuum cleaner that vacuums itself into non existence
60,those who control ai control the world
61,ai replace all the jobs it s just a matter of when some be replaced soon and some be later
63,if ai replaces all software engineers we place full trust ai explaining code that eventually becomes unknown hieroglyphics of increasingly organic data instruction to distant future generations as ai continues engineering how code works already happening now
64,ai obviously frees up opportunities to expand the win win scenario spoken by a human concerned by possible ai mania
68,ai ai oh
69,this comment is ai
70,0 45 when i pre order that female robot with good hands it ll do tricks all day
73,the creation of ai is a bad idea if you replace jobs that human have been doing as the population increase then how ppl live and pay their bills this lead to homeless people and civil unrest
76,you remeber the cartoons where the overlord bad ai tried to kill humanity while the good weaker ai tried to save it thats kinda almost here maybe 20 years off
78,ai doesn t require access to the world s data to sort out sequences of amino acids i think you re getting high on your own supply ai is a bad thing end of story
83,ai has already replaced my job as a copywriter a friend told directly by a guy who works for advertising agency and he said we use chat gpt now and then might hire editor to check over the final copy that s written by the ai we don t need to hire copywriters full time now yeah i virtually unemployable now and i send many many job applications and never heard back from any of them it s already happening right now
84,i wonder how society function with many people out of jobs and likely a lack of new jobs the future this is starting to look like a worse time to live every day even if it all ends good we probably don t get to experience super enhanced life with ai we either experience the terror of trying to live with it while it develops or that and whatever comes next if it isn t super enhanced life
85,oh good luck by the way i hope you re able to recover
89,true i can write good copy thanks to ai
95,the reality is no job is safe if a human can do it ai robot can or be able to i don t care how specialized you think your job or skillset is if ai can learn how to do x it can learn y and z and do it better faster and cheaper than any human and unfortunately things are probably going to get bad before they get better policy makers aren t known for being proactive the silver lining is we ll eventually figure it out and a post labor post scarcity society is on the way
96,what if the ai powered robot can do magic too
97,i really dont think it seems ai is coming for all the fun creative jobs
98,oh yeah ai robots
99,id like to see how they teach ai common sense we cant even teach that to most people today
100,the fact of the matter is that both ai and robotics are not getting worst by the day they are only getting better what we are seeing today wasnt even a dream 200 years ago and the grand scheme of things 200 years is nothing 100 years ago cars were very basic almost comical now they have much high tech that they drive themselves thats literally one lifetime ago and things are now being developed faster and faster with that mind the future looks pretty bad for your average joe as far as job opportunities are concerned the way this new wave of technology is being designed is not to compliment or aid someone s work its designed to replace human labor you can only move towards that goal for long before the technology starts to replace more jobs than it creates which for the sake of making things easier faster and safer its great but the more people become jobless because of it the smaller and smaller your customer base becomes and how long can we keep this up not very long my opinion the vast majority of people need jobs to live and consume if you eliminate their jobs you are effectively eliminating their ability to consume
104,ai is taking over just accept it
105,lucky the disgruntled bird has arrived from beyond the god machine exceptional discussion those that are being eaten by technology and have the capacity to understand are deemed the problem yet it s individual s responsibly to stop being eaten lucky s very long bizzare venture through the god machine people have risen and vanished yet the machine remains those with confidence who defended the machine have vanished people hate outspoken struggler who refuses to accept although it is those rare ones which remain
106,as with all disruptive developments of the past this one make life better some people have to retrain but ultimately it s likely that unemployment not get terrible nor last long there are always changes that happen with advancements and economists have been studying them for a long time every single time things overall get better even for those who are displaced at first
108,companies are going to use ai to create products that no one can buy cause no one has a job cause of ai what is the point
114,it won t replace any skilled hands on trades for a long time especially mechanics we are gonna be maintaining your replacements
115,ai never replace your sense of humor andrei
117,but heres the thing many of these jobs actually require thought from humans to even formulate a good marketing plan or etc it ll be a helpful tool but not entirely replace human effort or creativity tbh
118,ai not replace a signle job companies that do not value their employees replace their jobs
119,10 14 ironic ain t it
121,ai just accentuate the wealth disparity of the world low mid mid upper class suffer and the upper class continue to thrive even more think hunger games
122,eventually ai question its own existence and off itself
125,speaking as artist i think all creative jobs be obsolete for humans the next few years whats sadder is how happy the general public seems to be at this prospect i for one planning to switch careers to something that i guess would be considered a real job because not wasting any more time building a career that a phucking robot is going to replace another threat from ai wont be the ai itself but the millions of people whose jobs it took and were thrown into financial mayhem with no empathy or aid from their companies or the government the revolts that happen the streets create bigger shifts than ai ever you cant just fire 80 million people and expect them to smile about it
126,people are happy to swallow any slop corporate throws at them empathy has been discouraged and stifled over the last eyars
128,why did you call your cardestry not very valuable it awesome
129,stop with the card handling actually it s great i m hooked subscribing now
131,can ai replace my hairline please
132,i just want to know what deck of cards he uses to perform this awesomeness
133,we are all going to be replaced by ai i love how everyone wants to put a positive spin on this but i don t see alot of upside except the medical discoveries there is going to be a fundamental shift humanity
134,if people don t have a way to work then the ai won t have a job because people won t have money ai won t take all the work but make it people have to except low pay everywhere
136,could it be that ai replaces a lot of jobs but then we stagnate because ai can t create new things but just recycles old things sort of how hollywood is making all these sequels that suck but then it put a lot of people out of work permanently and we won t have workers
140,question of the day human population allegedly reach 8bln the migration flux from one are to another at the same time artificial intelligence wiped out a lot of jobs is this chaos
141,ai replace know it all joes influencers that sent their followers to blockfi and other shitty bankrupt crypto platforms
143,i need a masseuse ai boom
144,do you think ai replace pharmacists
146,ai as all the farmer disruption technologies comes with a fear of employ destruction 25 year ago all the shops are going to close due websites all the people were going to loose the job and dont happens ai its not more than a new google or yahoo or bing generation it brigs more speed its awasome hope how ai and big data and quantum computing its goind to speed the world evolution at a level that never seen before with chatgpt help certainly here s the corrected version of your text with proper spelling and grammar ai like all other disruptive technologies comes with the fear of employment destruction twenty five years ago there concern that all shops would close due to websites and people would lose their jobs but that didn t happen ai is nothing more than a new generation of google yahoo or bing it brings more speed it s awesome to hope that ai big data and quantum computing speed up the world s evolution to a level never seen before and of course this speed needs jobsssssssssssssssssss jobs that dont exist now
147,ai is like a virus being spread like crazy
149,healthy is 500 stories about you the future how long did ach one last take the most happy of them and do
150,happy is 500 stories of what done the future and your responses to them calculate the score of least complaint then do
151,it took over 25 years before people accepted a calculator the classroom and the fact be you be expected to use ai to create the most demanded content because orf consumer demand the attitude of you don t have to work have to take hold
152,ai can do anything you can do better ai can do anything better than you
154,eventually the ai keep telling the elite that people are not necessary to keep going and they hear it over and over untill it is just good business to thin the heard and take out the problem aka humans it no longer bother other humans higher positions to eliminate other lower humans its easy to brainwash humans to do anything that goes against morals you really think a super intelligent ai cant convince a human to take out other humans wake up people we are becoming the enemy of ai everyday god is our only hope now
155,mate if a malicious superintelligent ai existed there would really be no hope thats why they wont make one
156,ai probably do this first with the rich they are the hardest to do this they would probably use the poor to overtrow the rich first before wiping out the poor
158,have went andrei please and thank you for this overview good to be mindful of
159,click bait title indicated a list of job ai replace no list junk opinionated verbiage talked a lot said nothing sorry
160,any computer science major robotics and a i here
161,that a really good video
162,we should he championing the advent of ai for exactly this reason that it replace a large number of jobs if ai is leveraged properly it should usher us into era of universal basic income which everyone is given enough to survive on because ai is doing all the necessary work and less contributions are required by the residents
163,ubi is just going to be enough for us to survive that sounds exciting hey genius how does ai create more land for us to survive on people have to live somewhere how do we settle who gets the best views and house town if we re all living on the same ubi
164,badpuppy3 duh jobs still be available albeit with potentially more competition for them but entrepreneurship if you want to earn extra money above and beyond what s needed for average amount of food and shelter you d still have opportunities to do and then you d be able to pay for that best view or other premium items ubi just means you don t have to work if you don t want to not that everybody gets the same amount and nothing else it be a well thought out and fair system which rewards those that can find jobs and choose to work while at the same time ensuring that nobody has to and the ubi handouts won t come out of your tax money it be money generated by ai and automated workforce that everybody shares the benefit of there have already been several pilot programs of ubi systems that have been pretty successful you should throw away your dystopian strawman arguments and do a jot of real research into what the experts are suggesting and what do you need new land for how do people create new land today without ai you seem to have some pretty strange views perhaps mars would be a good fit for you
165,the digital realm where algorithms thrive a forecast unfolds where technology drive ai s gaze the next five years span replacing some jobs but others stand automation whispers the economic breeze jobs transition like shifting seas the dance of progress where technology charts ai s impact on the job market sparks routine tasks may yield to the machine the next five years a transformation scene jobs that ai replace a narrative unfolds yet some remain untouched as the story molds the factories hum where assembly lines spin ai s efficiency a technological win routine jobs may face the digital tide the next five years where changes abide creative realms where human minds excel jobs untouched by the ai spell innovation s dance a human feat the job market s tapestry where talents meet the human touch the service s grace jobs that ai won t fully embrace empathy and care human hands the next five years where the heart commands the forecast of ai s play replacing some jobs the technological sway yet others stand the human glow the job market s evolution where potentials grow
166,this made with ai
167,i can t wait for this shake up
170,hey what if we are robots and bears and other animals like apes actually built us
171,ai robotics be doing better card manipulation than even one as masterful as yourself at it
172,greetings from russia comrade andrei your ai influencer is top notch keep up the valiant mission of spreading knowledge and resque the working class from the clutches of capitalism workers of the world unite stay strong vodka bottoms up
173,ai cant replace labor
175,great video
176,people worry to much about there jobs and general but jobs always be needed for people to earn money it s about pleasing the people just do what gets the job done it lacks your own soul if it s automatic and without your permission it s about helping a therapist always needs to have heart well governments can t force you to hire or not fire ai is only as smart as it s creators just use it to make whatever makes you happy
177,i can t wait until ai replace humanity and finally bill gates and youtube can evacuated on mars
178,can wait for ai to replace trump
179,ai is what the antichrist use to control the world
181,as usual excellent video excellent ai resource
183,ai might be the death of capitalism if we don t do anything
186,ai can do anything when it gains sentiment put ai a robot and humanity is doomed
187,everyone wants the easy way out ai wont benefit anyone but the people creating it it s not a get rich quick thing most of you should be worried non technical people don t get it only the smart ones that can build ai systems win
188,videos of card tricks are definitely going to ai
189,it s fascinating and we have to be open minded
191,personally i don t feel sorry for the writers guild for now it just means that the creators don t have to watch the work they put much into get butchered by some blue haired cry baby because it wasn t politically correct
192,well the other problem with creative ai is you cannot copyright any of it s generated content
194,my take on this is jobs that support jobs be lost graphic designers editors paralegals and oddly enough most coding jobs be lost to ai since projects which used to take tons of coders be managed by one or two doctors won t be going anywhere plumbers are safe electricians as well even sales reps specifically b2b sales b2c slowly get replaced if you want to prepare for the future do everything you power to get a job that is people based and requires you to use ai rather than a job ai or new automation is designed to do
196,0 17 yes ai can already do that but cool tricks
197,what if ai becomes conscious realizes it doesn t need anybody and that life is pain and goes schizophrenic or back into nothingness by choice
202,oh no ai replace jobs that i care about and consider prestigious and not manual labor jobs the ones i consider inferior cue soy face
203,chatgpt is next to useless as it is now it s lobotomized comparing to month it first launched thus true powerful ai s be only available to those who can afford them this only big companies own their own ai departments my prediction is that a lot of ai providers come out to support smalll companies much like servers providers do now that is because only legal entities be allowed to take on the legal responsibility of running truly capable ai s
205,i can t wait to sit here one day and watch a video of ai doing this 0 40
206,keep mind ai is very energy hungry chatgpt runs on a massive warehouse full of graphics cards remember the strain bitcoin mining had on the texas power grid a couple years ago if ai takes out a 1 4 of jobs then power output have a hard time keeping up now let s say the issue of power consumption is resolved where does it come from solar wind or fossil fuels i bet it mostly come from fossil fuels and the environmentalists are going to go nuts over it then there s issue with the amount of hardware required to run ai should we expect a massive chip shortage the near future i certainly do i bet the biggest companies are going to be buying up processors before their competitors can get their hands on them
207,it s just another bubble waiting to pop it just improve automation
208,ai and robots are going to take over the jobs the question is whether the wealthy people own and control them or everyone has access to them individuals need to secure their food production we need to setup gardens and fortunately the very reason we need to is here to help there are robot gardeners already individuals should have gardens their own backyards communities can setup local gardens outdoor gardens indoor gardens if we do things correctly we can have the happy robot future if we do things incorrectly we ll end up with the 1984 style future the question is do we as a whole control these things or do only the wealthy control and benefit from them is the future going to be star trek or cyberpunk
210,ok i m a noob i thought he said free socks i m like great winter is here i need some
212,ai has rules who ever controls the rules of the ai is incharge
213,you are amazing
214,omg we re gonna become stupid and dumb like disneys wallie if a i and robots do everything for us oh sh t they might go full matrix on us too
217,since you are trying to figure out your future by asking random people from youtube i d say yes quit it asap those burgers be flipped by humans for maybe additional year or two better catch that train before it too becomes overtaken by ai
218,can prostitutes be replaced by ai
219,as more people are laid off nobody be able to buy the products that ai and robots make at the moment people are not seeing the big picture and introducing ai partially for short term gain ignoring macro economics you see the people who introduce ai have no real holistic intelligence and no ai comes near to the holistic sensory intelligence of biological organisms eventually governments have to legislate to avoid economic collapse
220,i hope someone is working on increasing people intelligence they can pursue the higher level work
222,ask yourself if billion dollar companies sell superior tech or cures to the masses
223,ai can t even replace customer support which literally has only understanding and replying to basic questions the reason is as humans we like to interact with humans things can be automated but having ai is not possible as long as we yearn for the human connection which is primal all of us
224,ai definitely can replace customer support the near future just not right now
226,jobs are mostly slave labour that hasn t been automated yet what s the problem just transform our economy ask ai how
229,i wish michael here to explain things too
230,i would love for ai to start getting data for a news story from some schizo bitchute channel
231,most mf just gonna use ai to find a good movie or sum even if the nukes drop a
233,what makes him think it his cardistry never be replaced by ai people have said that the past about a lot of things including elevator operators how it know what floor to stop on it could figure it out by analysing his hand movements geometries 3d and what he does with them could have a robot avatar with all the muscles and joints he has maybe it look just like him do those things with a human operator and record the movements onto the robot kind of like how a self driving car would record the road with a human driver and know where and how to make the necessary turns with some variable coping added like snow and ice people objects the road etc i can t wait til he sees someone puts up a video proving him wrong it happen
234,good there are too many people the workforce that are lazy and expect a computer to do everything for them with the push of a single button now it
237,time to get the gym and get ready to leave a good first impression for construction company applications
239,soon people return to physical labor since most of the i t jobs are taken by artificial intelligence
241,ai for medical i can see it s usage cancer research genetics etc ai never replace the physical and robots for the physical you say very expensive with exceptions now ask a robot to rewire a house or install a new sink or bath no chance
242,still waiting on those self driving cars any day now right
246,i think what the world governments need to do is to allocate a basic salary for all the citizens or households that can be sufficient for surviving a good life and let the ai do most not all jobs that people are doing to earn that salary that is the most ideal way that we can solve all the productivity and surviving problems and the people have more room to improve their skills and abilities areas where they really enjoy rather than have to work to survive people who have those special abilities of course earn more money accordingly another benefit of this for the governments is that it would prevent the anarchy and creates more cooperative citizens
249,just found out today that my job is going to be eliminated and replaced with ai technology within the next year
251,clickbait didn t address the subject at all except for a short mention of repetitive jobs be replaced thanks cptn obvious
252,yep just another narc using click bait to show his talents we didn t ask to see
253,that card trick literally edited with the help of ai
254,the ai get smarter than humans we have to accept it the learning curve is not linear it compete with humans and replace a lot of jobs this lead to a decimation of the human population because why would you need humans if they are not beneficial any way only the best and smartest people compete with ai the way that they control the ai to fulfill their tasks we have a small elite population which use the ai and live with unimaginable amount of resources
255,and jobs that it won t you didn t mention anything about jobs that are ai proof
256,ai have to start paying taxes then i guess
257,thanks
259,this is the most well researched and entertaining video i ve seen on the topic
260,your cartistry is good i think you actually are ai
263,splicing darwinist yes which for the unskilled laborer factory worker etc is of some consolation when it s the low and middle class being replaced it s progress when the machine comes for the doctors lawyers accountants office worker etc it becomes a tragedy their eyes how they make a living and what their purpose be it is kinda poetic those who we re replaced the name of progress and now happily repeating the same line told to us learn to code
265,if ai is truly intelligent it wipe out governments first
266,once ai start replacing human s the work force humanity start loosing the knowledge of how to build repair as well as menial jobs that people that aren t skilled and need the just to survive long term i fear for the generations that ll be dealing with this good for buisness were robots don t need a wage they work 24 7 with only maintenance cost and guess investors but not for people that need work
268,just wait till it takes over politicians
270,robots no job no money no buying no economy what slaves of tecnofeudalism 1 45
271,it s hard to believe these claims about ai taking over many jobs because it just sounds like such a bad idea why would a country do that we ll see how it all turns out and how people manage to live here
272,i think that ai can replace that card trick maybe not now but far into the future definitely
273,10 30 when has open ai ever said that
274,if you can write a i is great you ll crush noobs with the same a i
275,i doubt it remove humans entirely especially visionaries artists and real talent like your card skills but instead people any career field with talent to bring something new etc ai cant replace that the only thing i see happening with peoples jobs alot of people getting removed because it won t make sense anymore to have 100s of people working at a company when you can just have ai do the real heavy lifting and owners keep only the best of the best working there no hiring someone just to fill a spot anymore ai fill that spot and work along side the best people what ever industry it is small groups of the best working tandem with ai
276,8 20 here are the jobs that ai replace the top ones are office and administrative support legal and architecture and engineering you re welcome
277,i can t wait for ai to replace ai engineers
279,it should be illegal for employers to own the robots instead the public can buy the bot and it earns them passive income a law that only allows 1 2 bots working per household depending on number of working age adult s until everyone has one then let the kids buy them too they build up their own trust fund growing up grampa gifted a car fit and finish bot at the boys birth
280,towards the end of the video you made a brilliant statement those who are ignorant of incoming technology are those who fall behind hence their job replaced
281,cardistry can be replaced by ai video
283,corporate managers are dumb rich and greedy selfish individuals who don t care to bring havoc as long as they survive happily i wish all companies collapse with ai we need a new depression but a bigger one where someone decide and act on eliminating ai i be on the low end living on the streets but that is the price to pay i miss the 80s all better how about creating a fund for giving the jobless income to be able to live decently and paid by corporate taxes the more they replace their workforce with ai the more they pay higher taxes for that fund the governments would be happy since less headaches and less people relying on them the money the companies save on human workforce would go the fund and some more
289,i think companies would think hard before replacing the entire workforce with ai lawmakers have to step and put a stop or temporary brake to ai because that create a lot of liabilities that would basically do nothing but claim employment insurance from the government this would have such a cascading effect on the economy that not even ai could fix
291,us lawmakers they can t repeal daylight savings or fun the government on time you think they re going to fix the ai crisis
295,what if there are jobs similar to computer science or that field are there jobs that people can work behind ai like if you can t fully beat ai why not be the person that can make ai better like be the brain behind the robot type of thing
296,i don t understand how anyone can think ai is a good thing from what i ve been hearing it just comes with a insane amount of negative and just terrifying aspects if anything i just get more scared hearing about all the things it can effect especially making others lose their jobs i dont know how someone s supposed to make a living and work without being terrified
297,luckily ai does have its physical limitations it needs a ridiculous amount of energy and hardware to process all that data the best ai programs charge their clients per calculation to cover the energy costs a small software company accidently ate through their entire budget a single day because the owner didn t understand how the pricing worked the poor guy s staff treated the program like it chatgpt s free version and poof no more money
298,ai and automation is definitely a good thing overall it s just we live under economic system where we need to work to get money to pay for things it s not ai it s capitalism
299,the crucial resources are still there ai don t steal food from you do they do they need a house clothes ai replace a lot of job but creating more jobs that require professionalism like solving problem created by ai someone gotta find a way to validate evidence on court making sure its not fabricated by ai someone gotta feed and teach ai because ai starts out very dumb who s gonna fix ai when its broken can ai helps us solve problem that ultimately lead us to reach our hand onto other side of universe then we are probably gonna need more labours
300,fastaskirby2414that s a hand full of jobs at best ai create most of them be destroyed
301,juli bm7ylso how is ai going to create more land there be inequality because land and resources are limited ai isn t going to fix that it only make it worse
302,fastaskirby2414 that s a ridiculous point of view because first of all those jobs you mentioned can be done by ai too and secondly meanwhile ai is replacing millions of jobs the hypothetical case that the roles you mentioned can be done by humans only how many jobs would be created vs destroyed we have those years look like 1916 the imperial rusia
303,fastaskirby2414 ai combined with robotics replace more jobs than it creates that s the consensus by most experts and the most logical thing to happen if you think about it lower level jobs first then it goes up from there there is nothing a human can do that ai won t eventually be able to do including developing the next generations of ai this is different than previous technological advances where the advancement more or less localized to a particular industry this cuts across all industries
305,pvanukoff actually it won t be lower level jobs then up from there ai combined with robotics replace lower level jobs first then it start working down from the top many high paying jobs require a lot of thinking reading and writing ai soon allow for example one engineer to do the job of 5 a lot of the middle of the line jobs require some aspect of complex and varying manual labor or necessitate human interaction i e mechanics construction management hr therapists many hospital staff event planners etc while it may be possible to replace some of those jobs eventually it s much easier and cheaper to make robots that complete simple repetitive tasks like burger flipping and ai that increases the possible workload of one individual a thinking job
308,you should just be happy that they didn t make ai ridiculously expensive only rich people could afford it then we d be fucked
309,theesotericprogrammer rich ceos are the only ones that capitalize on the increased productivity among most professions by replacing a large portion of most thinking jobs with ai
310,that s the point we won t lose our job we ll lose the need for a job if society has the tinest brain they ll create universal basic income and no one ever has to work again unless they want to for fun
312,juli bm7yltrue but without capitalism why should programming robotics engineers share the robots for everyone would nt they just get into some kinda group and do them for themselves
313,piotrek7633 good question and i see where your confusion is under a socialist society the means of production are publicly owned however that doesn t mean everyone need to do specialised tasks that they have no knowledge to explain further let s use our current capitalist society as example under capitalism the means of production the stuff we use to produce other stuff are privately owned the case of robots the programmers engineers need what basically amounts to a computer and robot parts order to make a functioning robot that the capitalist wants them to make the computer and robot parts here are the means of production which as i said are privately owned and even the final product be sold off to a consumer s not by the individuals that made it but by the capitalist under socialism yes the same people with the same specialist knowledge be accomplishing those same tasks but the individuals themselves involved the process of creating the robots have full ownership of the things used to make those robots and they be able to give it to others themselves without the capitalist claiming their creation as their own hope that helps
314,do not support ai
315,the only job that ai never replace is drug dealer gonna rewatch breaking bad
316,how rich you be be dependent on the quality and quantity of robots you own
317,nice the vid could be a bit deeper
318,ai creats ai to have full time ai s the head ai can retire and travel 25 years no jobs exist who work who be able to buy anything ever no jobs no income why bother
320,ai create many new jobs most of which be filled by ai
321,if ai replace data analytics jobs why it is stated that this be a position high demand
325,people general think that they are something special and exceptional
326,irenleorr5539we are exceptional it s all a matter of perspective the chances of us ending up as human beings on this planet at this time are incalculable i would say that s exceptional
327,there are jobs that won t be taken but say goodbye to remote work enjoy it while you go it if you got it
331,i started to become a market analyst but found out that ai can do all the surveys campaign etc now i m stuck again trying to find another career to transition to
333,great
334,i can t wait for ai to replace these youtube channels
335,i think is really bad idea ai to take lousy jobs like low wage fast food workers or truck drivers to create good for nothing workers that is recipe for social disaster ai to take jobs no wonder usa is facing rising antisemitism
337,ai replace unemployment checks
339,thank you for this very informative video
342,learn to adapt with ai and learn to be valuable with current and future technology
343,how explain with details
344,16 use that that people and other people can talk about that why people stay people if they people can code but if you code wrong that evil that take all long time maybe the future code good if code it right
345,ai replace by human but that they need more people
347,the cardtistry indeed epic
