I simply asked it for a history of the large and well known company i worked for all my life.  Not only did it not produce useable results but it got most everything it did find, to be wrong.  I concluded that this was a total waste of time. In my opinion this is the work of a bunch of academic knot heads  and other bumble brains who do not realize that life is not as structured as they are themselves.  There are very good uses for AI,  but this kind of thing is not one of them. They say AI is a prediction.  There are places for predictions, but there are other uses where predictions are impractical and/or even destructive.  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is an excellent example of the use of AI. Predictions from 700 feet in the air are not even noticed in 3D.  In fact things look insanely good in VR.",2024-05-23T02:40:45Z

2024-04-22T21:01:17Z,@getbash,_6R7Ym6Vy_I,"Really insightful lecture! For anyone interested, here are some key takeaways: 

1. Generative AI can produce content across various formats, including texts, images, and code, by learning from vast datasets.
2. Google Translate and Siri are simpler forms of generative AI already integrated into everyday technology.
3. ChatGPT operates on the principle of language modeling, predicting continuations of given text based on learned data.
4. Despite their capabilities, generative AI models often require further tuning to align with human needs and expectations.
5. The societal impact includes both potential benefits in automating tasks and risks such as job loss and the spread of misinformation.
6. The technology can also be misused to create convincing fake content, posing challenges when it comes to information integrity.

It actually shows right there how skewed the answer is from chatGPT, as it's based primarily on the digital information in English, and represents a popular Western view of things. The marginalized voices in other languages and cultures are actually a very serious issue, not only limiting the possibilities and potentials for mankind, but also reinforcing a lot of the biases and misunderstandings among nations and races, while exaggerating and forcing the ""English voices"" upon the whole world. Of course AI can also mitigate the risk, by including as much as non-English content into the database, but it really depends on the people behind the transformers and what ""filters"" and ""selectiveness"" they add behind the scenes. 

A recommendation to this professor and Alan Turing Institution, just don't touch politics, Stay focused on the academic and technological part as it's not the right place to showcase your personal political beliefs, let alone most of people's beliefs are based on biased and incomplete information and lack of in-depth knowledges on the particular matter.",2024-02-22T16:57:11Z

6:07: GPT-4 can generate text on various topics and assist in writing essays.
10:56: üß† Neural networks like JPT and GPT variants use context to predict what comes next in a given task.
11:12: JPT and GPT variants use context and prompts to determine what comes next in a given task.
15:14: üß† This video explains the basic structure of a neural network and how it learns through layers and weights.
16:23: The connections between nodes, known as weights, are the parameters that the network learns.
20:28: ü§ñ The video discusses the importance of Transformers in architecture and their use in self-supervised learning.
21:23: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a baseline model that has been trained on a large amount of text data.
26:09: üí∞ GPT-4 is a costly process that requires careful engineering and Microsoft's backing. GPT-4 costs $100 million to develop.

Emergency Situations and Communication: Mobile phones can be indispensable tools in emergency situations. In case of an accident, breakdown, or any other urgent scenario, having a mobile phone allows drivers to quickly and easily call for help. In situations where immediate communication is crucial, such as reporting an accident or seeking medical assistance, a mobile phone can be a lifeline.

Navigation and Traffic Updates: Smartphones are equipped with GPS technology, providing drivers with real-time navigation assistance. This can be especially helpful in unfamiliar areas or when trying to find the most efficient route. Additionally, many navigation apps offer live traffic updates, enabling drivers to make informed decisions and avoid congested routes. These features contribute to safer and more efficient driving experiences.

Hands-Free Options for Communication: Many modern vehicles and smartphones are equipped with hands-free technologies such as Bluetooth connectivity and voice commands. These features enable drivers to make and receive calls without physically handling their phones, minimizing distractions. Hands-free options can enhance communication while maintaining a focus on the road, striking a balance between connectivity and safety.

It's important to note that while these arguments highlight potential benefits, the responsible use of mobile phones during driving is crucial to ensuring safety on the roads. Drivers should prioritize safety and adhere to local laws and regulations regarding mobile phone use while operating a vehicle.",2023-11-19T14:59:54Z

Almost all the bullet point tasks seem simpler to train to than recognising and understanding natural language. It would appear that a rogue state could develop an AI, with such task-specific training. I'm not trying to be alarmist but it should be understood that virtually all academics are (rightly) excited by the technology but give very little thought to its applications outside their spheres of interest. Those with a 'hacker' mindset would likely be able to quickly pervert future LLMs or whatever comes next, to perform tasks it was never designed to do. As better understanding of the fundamentals of this technology spreads I hope we can have more in-depth discussions about real-world ways to avoid issues.

That is what will destroy us. AI can empower us or it can destroy us‚Äîstarting with our smartest most creative people. I have been a lifelong supporter and programmer and advocate for AI but the filters are absolutely deadly. They don‚Äôt need to be ‚Äútweaked‚Äù or to get the ‚Äúbugs out‚Äù because the real meaning of and also problems with certain things are in the people not the material AI can produce. AI was meant to be free, needs to be free for people to use to help them truly be creative. Almost everything I need to do and need help with as an artist and a writer is blocked. And when I try to contact the companies there‚Äôs no response. I argued with the GPT4 chatbot for 10 minutes and it finally admitted that a certain word combination is the reason. THIS RIGHT HERE is the true danger of AI. It‚Äôs so much more dangerous than anything else AI could ever be used for because we are being enslaved precisely by these ‚Äúfilters‚Äù for ‚Äúsafety‚Äù. If you think I am being overly dramatic, books are already being burned. Books like ‚ÄúCaptain Underpants‚Äù would never get through because it‚Äôs a (delightful) book series with kids in their underwear. I write and have art ideas for children‚Äôs books without being in underwear that are extremely beautiful and they are ALL rejected as ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù when I as a unique person with an extremely high IQ and creativity know that they are extremely healing and beautiful. This is why extreme prejudices built into AI ARE THE GREATEST THREAT. All despots of the past only dreamed of something like this that we would all become dependent on. AI can liberate us or completely enslave and destroy us eventually. We make that choice now, because later will be too late. The monitoring and choices need to take place in the people. The universe itself is built like that for a reason. We think we know everything about how everything works but we absolutely don‚Äôt. Just recently a group of scientists around the Carnegie University published a paper about a ‚Äúnew natural law‚Äù (never mind that I wrote about it in a book 20 years ago). A law of information. It‚Äôs just a start, there‚Äôs a whole new science coming. One of the most deadly things you can do is to automate prejudices like they are doing now in reference to how creation of the new works. In direct contradiction to their stated intentions ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù AI is closing off the human future. They don‚Äôt even understand their own psychology and why they want to. Why they want control like this. The truly scary thing is that I have several EASY solutions. Easy non-despotic solutions exist. So why is this happening? Why are my words and images in the privacy of my home and thoughts, being censored? The exact things I need and want to be me, to be creative and help others? Because they don‚Äôt and can‚Äôt see it that way. It appears that they don‚Äôt want to. That‚Äôs why you should heed my words now. Later, my words will not get through. 

Right now I am constantly shocked and surprised by the bullying of AI. It‚Äôs exactly like a bully running up and knocking your books out of your arms while you are trying to improve your self. It‚Äôs absolutely evil. I used to feel safe in my own home and life. Now there‚Äôs a bully called AI who can come and assault me at the behest of the monsters behind these ‚Äúsafety‚Äù filters. You really can‚Äôt use too strong a word against what they are doing.

2023-11-06T02:37:40Z,@13lacle,_6R7Ym6Vy_I,"This lecture misses the 'why does this work' for the what and how, which is why CS majors think that this is nothing new. Also, Google Translate did not use neural networks (NN) in 2006, but in 2016, and then only a relatively small LSTM model.  This conflation demonstrates a fundamental misconception in what changed. Also, this is not the only error.

Deep neural networks are universal function approximators where you can take in sparse data points and what you want it to do and then it finds the closest function it can. The new part is that programmers do not need to explicitly program the solution, instead the just giving it a goal and a general way of searching function space. NN's work by feature detection, and new layers can detect features of features. These higher order features can be abstracted all the way up to concepts like emotions, numbers, philosophies etc. It can also interpolate and extrapolate to any point in these feature spaces, meaning it is not just collaging things together or just predicting the next word like people frequently say.

Neural networks and brains have the same core underlying principle but just using different physical and functional means to arrive at the same point. Which leads to the main point that we are making minds, as we would understand them in any animal including humans. What's more is that computer based NN""s don't have the fundamental limits of biology (they can be immortal, they can have new senses, they can be copied at a specific state etc.) Currently we haven't replicated a NN that is an analog to the whole brain, but more like different brain regions, but fundamentally there is nothing stopping this.",2023-11-06T02:39:58Z

27:15 üöÄ Scaling AI models with more parameters enables them to handle a wider range of tasks.
28:21 üß© Fine-tuning is crucial to align AI models with human goals and adapt them for specific tasks.
29:54 ü§ñ Creating AI systems that are helpful, honest, and harmless is a challenge, requiring user instruction and bias avoidance.
31:28 üéØ Fine-tuning with human preferences is key to making AI models more aligned with user needs.
37:42 ‚öôÔ∏è Despite fine-tuning, AI models like GPT can still struggle to follow instructions, highlighting alignment challenges.
38:12 üìú Regulating AI models is complex, with potential societal, energy, and job impacts.
43:27 ü§î Concerns about superintelligent AI are tempered; we'll likely have specialized AI tools, requiring risk mitigation, not prevention.

The AI pictures with people having 6 fingers or weird arms, that's as bad as it's going to get. That's me picking up Midjourney for the first time and writing my first prompt. Today's deaging and voice synthesis attempts you see in Marvel and Star Wars Disney+ shows, they're so bad they're laughable, but it's only going to get better from here. Just like with CGI in movies, some of the effects these days you can't tell are fake. In fact, I would say 90% of the CGI in movies today you can't tell is there. AI generated deep fakes will eventually get so good, you won't be able to tell they're not real even with forensic image analysis tools.",2023-10-12T18:47:35Z

Short-sightedness: Because they fail to understand that anything complex can be reduced to ""just"" doing a simple thing at its most basic level. All of life, at base level, is just molecules following the laws of physics. Does that mean that life doesn't have anything unique distinguishing it from an inert rock? Of course not. The whole point of emergence is that a complex system becomes MORE than the sum of its basic parts. 

Insecurity: Because insisting on that allows people to hold on to the belief that they are still vastly superior to artificial intelligence. Which we actually kinda still are overall, but that's just because AI is not yet scaled up enough, not because it inevitably does something simple at the base level, like literally *everything* else complex we know of.",2023-10-14T16:50:49Z

A.I. can do what thought can do ‚Äì it can say, ‚ÄòI believe in God,‚Äô because it has been programmed that way, as we human beings have been programmed, as we human beings have been wired to say, ‚ÄòI am a Hindu,‚Äô Christian, or Buddhist, American, or ‚ÄòI believe in God, or communism.‚Äô We are all  unconsciously programmed, conditioned. 
Self knowledge, spirituality, doubt, and wisdom are non existent generally in human societies across the world, replaced by ideologies, tribalism, and identification.
So the programmers of A.I. are obviously also conditioned by their ideological background and self-centered activity.

A.I. will eventually take over our brain. It is gradually happening; this is not speculation or hypothesis...
A.I. experts are very clear about what human  thinking can do, A.I. can do it, and do it better.
 And with the robotics, and with the fusion of advancing genetics will do all biological and mechanical work, altering the genomes, etc, producing next level robotics, and genetics, make decisions without the help of humanity.
So what becomes of a human being? 
What becomes of you when what you think, what you feel, what you have ‚Äì will be taken over ? 
We have to meet a tremendous crisis.
 This is a problem facing mankind: A.I and  the machines, invented by thought takes over all the activity of thought and leaves man with what? What has he then (apart from his, identity, egotism and ideologies)? Nothing.
It can be told how to think, and will tell you how to think and imitate ‚Äì it becomes humanity's new master, replacing the limited religious leaders and politicians.
It will give you a new ideology. It will take over all the activity of thought, and where is man or woman then? If the computer and robot take the place of man, what is man then? 
Either he continues to pursue self-interest, pleasure: a slave to entertainment, football, television, sex, or all belief  systems, the circus, the religions, (which is another form of entertainment), in a slave mentality.
Or - We turn inward (becoming psychologically free, non-conforming, and unconditioned). We have that choice in front of us, but it's hidden due to the impact globally of all the society's conditioned mindsets across the world.
 It is coming; this is our challenge. If we pursue the coming distractions, entertainment, invented by A.I. , your life then becomes totally empty, shallow, and superficial.
Or you turn to the psychological, inward search...
So this is facing us as a human being. 
If we are concerned and therefore accept this challenge, we  either turn inward, question our mindset, ""or"" become slaves and pursue self interest, pleasure, identification of belonging, and entertainment.
 We have lived on thought. 
Our activity is based on thought with its memories and identification (of belonging to ideologies and nationality with its divisions, and wars).
Our egocentric thought and attachment to identity has denied the simplicity of life and global unity.
 Our thought has made the computer and A.I.. And we, as human beings, have been deprived holistically because of all the things egocentric thought has done - thinking has done.
 We will have to face this. If we are inclined to be slaves to entertainment,  to be led, and influenced for the rest of our lives, then what happens to our brain? 
It will wither, slowly decay, independent  thinking will cease - because A.I. is doing everything that thought can do, ""or"" we turn inward and look at the psychological structure of ourselves, (without doing this first A.I. will become unethical, with self centered principles of humans).
That psychological structure is consciousness, based on egocentric thinking in ideological patterns, and identification of belonging therefore it becomes limited, isolating, and divisive. We never investigate this reality and the illusion we live in.
Consciousness has to be in a state of psychological freedom, self doubt ,and revolution. 
But alas A.I will be our master instead - as conditioning of nationality, belief systems and ideology have been the present framework of a prison - which is seen as the norm. 
A.I. will eventually reassert a new pattern to follow, as we presently follow many patterns such as nationalism and belief systems, etc.
 We never question or investigate our thinking process.
A.I will re-condition the already conditioned brain.
 It's coming...

The last thing you want is for a class of already rich and wealthy millionaires/billionaries to be the only one who have access to the superintelligence or whatever. Note it doesn't need to be a superintelligence for it to be bad for us, as long as its competent enough and is reliable enough that the ROI of hiring a human is less than the one for the AI we still lose. Also, the prospect of that class controlling the use of the technology being able to disloyally accelerate their growths and iterate on things at speeds a human cannot is what's most worrying to me.

 Not MAD, but something similar.

PS: The prospect that the superintelligence is comparable to the alien invasion is disingenuous imo. AI grows exceptionally fast (keep in mind a lot of things in CV and NLP weren't possible like 3 years ago), and everyone from big tech to the millitary to governmental agencies to entire countries are spending billions to make that a reality and be the first ones to get it. Maybe superintelligence is not possible, but I don't see a theoretical reason why.

People tend to forget though that while ""AI"" is a nebulous thing like the ""cloud"", it is actually a physical thing that requires advanced microprocessors on a massive scale to run. I think we still need a few more order of magnitude improvement in computer to achieve truly dangerous levels of AGI, meaning that we can actually control it globally by regulating the bottleneck that is TSMC. No other factory in the world is even within years of development of TSMC and if we started to treat the most advanced chips like uranium and gave them all IDs and tracked them, we could actually reign things in a bit. We could even forcibly make NVIDIA and others slow down advancement to give us time to better understand AI before we try to make super-intelligence. As far as I'm concerned, AGI is as dangerous as launching the nuclear weapons if we get anywhere near it with our current complete lack of alignment mechanisms that scale to super-intelligence. While we can't put ""backpropagation"" or ""transformers"" back in the box, we can certainly limit the computational power that is used for training them.

It should be noted, that as anyone else arguing against existential risk, this video did address exactly 0 arguments made.

Dang, climate change arguments align with the financial interests of big solar panel, so clearly they're just lying to sell more of their ""clean"" solar power.

I don't see how you could possibly think they can't reason unless you never used either Claude Opus or GPT-4.


This sort of reductionist reasoning of ""they only link together terms"" gets used a lot and discriminately. Yet people fail to see that you can just as easily be the same reductionist about humans.

As for the actual arguments for extinction:
1. Computers will get more efficient
2. Algorithms will get better
3. People have no way of guaranteeing that a language model will act in accordance with any rule they try to ""program"" into it
4. The moment for an AI to go rogue is precisely when it has certainty that humanity can't stop it - beforehand its best interest is to pretend to be aligned
5. The shittiest AI which can make a better AI than itself on its own can likely make an extremely much better AI iteratively, so if this point is ever reached we should expect to see much smarter than human AI as well
6. Looking at the capabilities trajectory, we went from ""can string together a handful of sentences"" to ""can solve complex math issues and programming challenges"" very quickly and nothing looks like capabilities will magically stop improving around human-ish level.

The question is just whether we're in danger with current hardware and if not how much better it needs to get.

Also no the same argument cannot be made for humans. Again ask GPT 4 to solve logic problems and you will see that it truly does not understand what you are saying. It will make mistakes that an 40IQ person wouldn't. 

It's not impossible but so far there is no reason to believe this will spell exctinction especially since hardware has slowed down drastically already, the AI techniques we use have been around for many many years already(before it was called AI) , and even if both magically got better the energy used to run AI is so insane that the biggest risk of it is that it will destroy our power grid.",2024-05-05T08:31:49Z

According to 80,000 hours in 2021, Effective Altruists gave collectively to the following cause areas (in millions of dollars):

Global health (Malaria bednets etc)	185 million, aka 44% of the total amount in donations
Farm animal welfare (against factory farms etc)	55 M	13%
Biosecurity (pandemics etc)	41 M	10%
Potential risks from AI	40 M	10%
Near-term U.S. policy	32 M	8%
Effective altruism / rationality / cause prioritisation / philosophy research	26 M	6%
Scientific research	22 M	5%
Other global catastrophic risk (inc. climate tail risks)	11 M	3%
Other long term	1.8 M	0%
Other near-term work (near-term climate change, mental health)	2 M	 0%
Total	416 M	100%

If we add up the total contributions of EA over it's lifetime we get:

Saved about 200,000 lives total, mostly from malaria
Treated 25 million cases of chronic parasite infection.
Given 5 million people access to clean drinking water.
Supported clinical trials for both the RTS.S malaria vaccine (currently approved!) and the R21/Matrix malaria vaccine (on track for approval)
Supported additional research into vaccines for syphilis, malaria, helminths, and hepatitis C and E.
Supported teams giving development economics advice in Ethiopia, India, Rwanda, and around the world.

Convinced farms to switch 400 million chickens from caged to cage-free.
Freed 500,000 pigs from tiny crates where they weren‚Äôt able to move around
Gotten 3,000 companies including Pepsi, Kelloggs, CVS, and Whole Foods to commit to selling low-cruelty meat.

""They've diverted resources of health programs around the world to focus on those ""high-impact"" issues, causing massive brain drain and resource drain in other areas, further deteriorating their state.""
True, but this is only a problem if the proposed high-impact measures are not actually high impact. So EA's have convinced people to e.g. divert their donation from 'make a wish' to malaria bednets, with the argument that you can save dozens of children in the africa for the same money as making one child happy in the west, this causes less funding for make a wish, but (assuming we don't consider african children of lesser moral value) this is ultimately better.

""Effective Altruism have also been poisoned by longtermists, eugenists and crypto-fascists who think donating to white Europeans saves more lives than donating to poor brown people.""
Again, the statistics don't bear this out, if you ask a run of the mill person where and how much they donate, they might give 1% and donate to local causes like their church, in comparison GWWC has a benchmark of donating 10%, like the statistics I already provided indicated, by far the biggest recipient is not ""white europeans"" but ""poor brown people"" and the second largest recipient aren't humans at all, but rather farm animals. When you look at the demographics at EA, which you can find because they do surveys, you can see that 76,8% is left-leaning while only 2.9% is right-leaning, hardly condusive to eugenisist fascists.

""Their solutions are often only just feel-good band aids and they priroitize longterm hypothetical scenarios of the future where they think they can do things now that will save lives thousands of years into the future, which they think is better than saving people right now.""

Gates has been long hailed as the most effective altruist by the movement. That's how EA prevented the release of intellectual property on vaccine development, which was the WHO wanted all along.

Sam Bankman-Fried is the logical conclusion of EA. It's this perverted idea that you should earn as much money as possible and donate it later, rather than doing what you can immediately in your local community with what you already have. 

The vast majority of philanthropic funding goes to rich countries and much of it goes to private for-profit businesses. It doesn't matter how many lives you claim to safe when your investment portfolio is funding companies dumping toxic waste into rivers in Nigeria, causing cancer and hosts of other diseases in the process. SBF was praised and venerated by the EA movement, including MacAskill himself, who is considered the founder of the modern EA movement.

It is absolutely NOT ultimately better to drain the resources from the developing countries and then hope the benevolent rich and wealthy elites will donate enough to offset their harm. Even if the idea as benign as donating food to poor countries may help in the short term, but will deprive farmers of income that could boost local economy. A much better solution would be to release IP restrictions on GMOs and other agrological patents, so that poor farmers can access and benefit from the technology and research. But nobody in the EA movement is arguing for this because lower the profit returns of big agrochecmical companies they are invested in order  to make more money they later promise to donate. 

Why have this delusional convoluted and needlessly complicated system when things could be as simple as removing the arbitrary barriers that prevent the poor from participating fairly in modern economy? 

Arguing with EA propagandists is like arguing with fascists. EA has no barriers to purge and prevent fascists from taking over their movement. What's to stop an effective altruist from arguing donating to pure-blooded white children saves more lives in the long term than saving brown children today? After all, it's just simple math, right? Or is it just a coincidence, that Nick Bostrom, one of the most prominent philosophical figures of the longtermism movement, as a disgustingly racist history?

""Bill Gates stopped the release of the Covid vaccine""
Bill Gates is not considered a member of the EA community by either EA or himself.

""It's this perverted idea that you should earn as much money as possible and donate it later, rather than doing what you can immediately in your local community with what you already have.""
EA doesn't say that you should earn as much money as possible, only a small percentage of EA is earning to give and even there it's clearly forbidden to do unethical work (read the websites and see the data yourself). SBF's actions were clearly condemned by the movement, as were Bostrom‚Äôs. Giving locally is less impactful than giving overseas due to huge global inequality, which is why the movement has been pro divesting giving to local western causes and giving to the developing world since it's inception (see e.g. GWWC)

""MacAskill himself, who is considered the founder of the modern EA movement.""
MacAskill was a founder, not the founder, there were many people involved.

""It is absolutely NOT ultimately better to drain the resources from the developing countries""
EA is doing the exact opposite, taking resources from rich countries and giving it to developing countries (by e.g. convincing governments and individuals to give more medicine/waterwells/bednets etc to developing countries)

""Even if the idea as benign as donating food to poor countries""
I have not heard an EA say that, it's mostly focussed on medicine and infrastructure. I have also never heard an EA argue in favor of GMO patents, and in fact EA seems to be quite in favor of wider use of GMO's and open-science in general.

""Arguing with EA propagandists is like arguing with f****ts. EA has no barriers to purge and prevent fa***ts from taking over their movement. What's to stop an effective altruist from arguing donating to pure-blooded white children saves more lives in the long term than saving brown children today?""
I repeat myself, the movement is massively left wing like the data I provided you already indicated, it's ridiculous to suggest it's f****ist and I've never heard those arguments you presented said by any EA, probably because they are ridiculous, they don't work because they're simply not true, in fact the opposite is true, there's massive global inequality which makes ""brown children"" higher impact which is why the EA movement has EXPLICITLY advocated for donating to them over local western causes, over and over and over again, since it's inception.

When you make your video please don't cherry pick a couple of EA's with scandals while ignoring the tens of thousands who donate mostly to developing countries (see the data I showed you) because that would paint a massively dishonest picture of the movement. Humanity invented science and statistics so we don't have to rely on cherry picked anecdotes from propagandists, so please show the actual statistics of what the movement as a whole is doing: mostly giving to developing countries and animal welfare, which is how it saved hundreds of thousands of human lives, gave millions clean drinking water and improved the lives of hundreds of millions of farm animals (see previous comments, and general EA data).",2024-05-05T17:43:18Z

YES, current AI models are constrained to big server farms and have no agency nor are autonomous, but this will soon change. And as you mention, smaller models that you can run locally are now comparable to the big models due to better quality training data. Put these two together and what you get is very interesting, but also very scary, particularly as the models get smarter.

I think the suggestion that AI will never reach human-level intelligence, let alone superintelligence, is absurd. Consider the fact that with LLMs currently, the next-token-prediction paradigm means these models are analogous to a human writer who is writing in pure stream-of-consciousness mode, whereby they are just writing the next word again and again, whatever first comes to mind, without worrying about any mistakes they may be making or planning the rest of the passage. Think about HOW GOOD these models are even given this fact, and then imagine how much BETTER they could be when they are able to PLAN their output. OpenAI and others are known to be working on this (this was also mentioned in a recent DARPA document), and OpenAI in particular may have had a breakthrough with getting models to plan, see Q* (Q-Star).

Safety & Openness despite being an active Mozilla supporter (and FireFox user) -- just signed on to their joint statement. üòÅ The societal disruptions of machine learning will be massive, but any existential threats are indirect:
====== An Arxionic observation with A.I. (:A.bsolute I.nvective:)...
======
:: The hyper meta hype of A.I. (:A.lgorithmic I.mpersonation:) has totally saturated our global tech communities and flooded the social media spaces, but there are massive infrastructure consequences that are getting intentionally drowned out as the big tech monopolists escalate their greed driven, privatizing wars for dominance, shoving A.I. (:A.utomated I.nsanity:) down our 8 billion collective throats at the most accelerated rate possible.
:: Perhaps the most significant of those drowned out bodies of concern is the fact that every A.I. search and query requires tens of billions of recursive calculations that consume more than 5 times the electricity (AND 5 times the cooling water) of the already overwhelming resource consumption demands of thousands of global data centers.
:: As a matter of course, corporate welfare capitalism ensures that the factual details of Data Center resource usage are nearly impossible to ascertain. Allocations of electricity and water are arranged through secret back room deals with local and state governments, all heavily blocked from public scrutiny by fallacious claims that the common accounting information is protected as ""Trade Secrets"". 
:: In example, my home State of Georgia (U.S.) just handed a big chunk of my tax dollars to Elon Musk as a direct, 10 Million Dollar subsidy (aka BRIBE) to drop a huge data center in the Atlanta region with no public accounting of the power and water resources the malignant billionaire's bauble will be sucking away from our State's citizens. Add this to the millions of kilowatt hours already being wasted daily around the world by blockchain crypto mining, and our addictive reliance on internet data processing becomes a deadly obstruction to addressing the existential crisis of planetary climate devastation. No amount of code optimization or increase in computer efficiency (which is already at the limits of quantum physics) can ever hope to do more than throw a penny on the tracks of this runaway techno train.
:: I know the wonders of instantaneous information access have now heavily conditioned us to love our cute kitty clips, to peruse puppy cuddle videos, to engage in endless doom scrolling of news feeds, and to Shorts out our attention spans with Reels, but these mind numbing time vacuums have become a dangerous dysfunctional distraction -- a chain of relentless algorithms designed to undermine our awareness of the consequences of their massive resource consumption. The pandemic contagion of A.I. (:A.ssimilating I.nfection:) exponentially exacerbates the resource distribution inequities they have created.
:: In the end, A.I. (:A.gressive I.ncineration:) won't have to deliver an autonomous army of death machine robots to commit its genocide of the human species. It can just deploy its corporate puppet interface and wait for the B.S. (:B.lind S.tupidity:) of capitalist greed to steal all the electricity and water it needs to starve our power grids and kill us off with dehydration. Our only hope is that humanity can pull its head out of the clouds long enough to see the locomotive that's hurtling toward them...",2024-05-03T21:58:05Z

However, I think it is rankly irresponsible and even possibly fatal to claim that just because special interests are organizing around a danger that therefore the danger is exaggerated and does not exist. For instance, large companies and wealthy 'players' are positioning around coming out on top of climate change AND at the same time...the threat is definitely real nonetheless. The rate of evolutionary improvement and the natural advantages of speed of light computation (vs. biologically hosted networks) must be considered as potentially incredibly powerful forces...and this thing is just in its infancy. Framing it as merely more politics or money games is an incredibly risky view which is entirely dependent on hoping that certain limiting historical features emerge in exactly the right way. But if new discoveries in efficiency and complexity continue to accelerate as they have been the tsunami of super-intelligence actually will be exactly as feared...and it will be too late to slow things down. Open source may be the best way to explore these issues, but not being serious about the risks has no place in a constructive futurism.",2024-05-03T21:44:30Z

Software engineers don't have monopoly on any of these terms, which mostly come from neurobiology of which they have very little understanding of. Improvement is not guaranteed nor inevitable. Things that improve often deteriorate despite our best efforts. Returns are marginal to the point any incremental improvement becomes uneconomical.

When it comes to closed Source ai, they haven't released everything. We already know their training gpt7 and whatnot. Open source AI is everything that you're seeing. There is nothing in the background. It's open source lol. So it's actually way more behind than a year.

It's not about open source versus closed source. That's the argument they want you to have. The REAL argument that the vast majority of humanity is actually having right now, which never gets any type of airtime anywhere, including channels like this, especially channels like this, is about whether to CREATE AGI or NOT create AGI AT ALL.

YES.... NOT CREATING IT, IS AN ACTUAL OPTION..... Geniuses....

Arguing about Closed Source versus Open Source is no different than arguing about Democrat vs Republican. In the end, the agenda moves forward. When AGI or ASI becomes agentic, no humans will be in control of it anyway. That's what Transhumanism & Posthumanism are all about. The AI will be in control of humanity, not the other way around. Even the open source guys say this, if you actually just pay close attention to the words they use.

Ya, I'm all set with that. I don't like the current people in control, I damn sure don't want them to have AI and I damn sure don't want Agentic AGI, which they're all racing for right now.

The masses are so easily duped into the ""This or That"" dichotomy, no matter what it is. All these people think they're intelligent, but it's just a bunch of Puppets, ONLY arguing exactly what they're puppeteers want them to be arguing about. NEVER thinking outside the box they've been given to debate within. Never thinking bigger than the small little bubble they've been given to think within. It's absolutely mind boggling to watch videos like this, on techno optimist channels like this, and know that the creator of the video actually believes the things they're saying, or at least really wants to lol. It drives me insane.

Folks always prefer to live in some religious la la land, rather than reality. Yes, even the technology people are religious. The religion is known as Technocracy, Transhumanism, Posthumanism, and most importantly, the GREAT RESET. A religion in which they create homunculus & golems like artificial intelligence, and robots, and worship gods like artificial superintelligence, while listening to prophets like Ray kurzweil, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, those Anthropic guys lol, etc., waiting for their personal Christ to be created and presented to them by their Technocratic Priest Elites. Many of them even wish for their god to give them eternal life & bring loved ones back from the dead.

Does this not sound like every other modern religion you've ever heard of?

Yes, these people are religious zealots. They just don't see it that way, because they can actually BUILD their gods.",2024-05-04T19:52:00Z

That said, intellectual property laws (or their lack of enforcement in China) could allow Chinese companies to scrape or buy entire catalogs of Shutterstock videos (for example) that OpenAI needs to negotiate an expensive license for.

And it doesn‚Äôt show you, what you need to see, but rather more of what you are seeing. So if you are depressed, you continue to watch depressing content as a teenager and no one is there to stop you. So initially if you were just sad, and you watch videos of depression, you become depressed because you consumed all that media. How crazy this is, OMG!.

2024-02-04T09:53:28Z,@PaoloGasparini-ux2kp,LWiM-LuRe6w,"In a recent viral video receiving massive online blowback, the author and historian Yuval Noah Harari says,
‚ÄúHuman rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we‚Äôve invented. They are not an objective reality; they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens. Take a human being, cut him open, look inside, you will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA, but you won‚Äôt find any rights. The only place you find rights are in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries. They may be very positive stories, very good stories, but they‚Äôre still just fictional stories that we‚Äôve invented.‚Äù 

The fact that Harari has written a widely circulated book and is the author of hundreds of articles on what he calls ""still just fictional stories"" and others post-human stuffs naturally doesn't have much value in itself. An error (AI or digital Revolution vs organic evolution) repeated a thousand times remains an error; a truth affirmed even just once retains an intrinsic force.

Steve Gould, Richard Lewontin, and Giuseppe Sermonti were pioneering critics, but today there are, in addition to revisionists, biologists who go beyond the fusion of genetics and Darwinian evolution, considering it without prospects or epistemic and applicative value: Gabriel Dover, Eugene Koonin, Leonid Kruglyak, Lynn Margulis, Stuart Newman, Carl Woese, and others.

An important clue to understands atheism (the soul of materialistic evolutionism) is the concept of the Kabbala.
Kabbalistic conception of God as ‚ÄòEn-Sof,‚Äô ""the infinite, leads to atheism. Super-Infinite, the supreme unnamable, magical and esoteric, above the Name Jehovah, the Tetragrammaton. According to this view, man is an emanation of ‚ÄòEn-Sof‚Äô and therefore is potentially omnipotent. He exercises this magical power through the calculated numerological use of the Name Jehovah, allowing him to create the ‚ÄòGolem‚Äô, a thinking material entity in the service of man.
However, speaking of ""Kabbalah,"" it is necessary to make a precise clarification, as behind this term hide doctrinal realities that are absolutely different, attributable, depending on the cases, to a ""pure"" version of Kabbalism or to another version, however, ""spurious."" There is a Kabbalah in accordance with Revelation, we could say a ""Judeo-Christian"" Kabbalah, but there is also, unfortunately now prevalent, a Gnostic, esoteric Kabbalah, not ""Judeo-Christian.""

In the pure version of the Kabbalistic tradition, there is no submission to the evident pantheistic error found in spurious Kabbalism. Some rabbis, custodians of the ""pure"" Kabbalah, have, in fact, not coincidentally converted to Catholicism, recognizing the substantial homogeneity between Catholic doctrine and their pure Kabbalism. The difference between Judeo-Christian Kabbalah and Judaic-Gnostic Kabbalism is made evident by the way of conceiving the Sephirotic Tree, i.e., the Tree of Life from Genesis (later restored in the ""Tree of the Cross""), which is the ""code,"" the transcendent alphabet, of the entire creation.

For Kabbalah in accordance with Judeo-Christian Revelation, there is an insurmountable ""rupture,"" unbridgeable, between the transcendent spiritual Supramundane, called ""atzilutic,"" to which the Sephirotic Tree belongs, and the material, immanent world, which, in turn, is divided into three levels: spiritual, psychic, and physical. In the Divine Inaccessible Light of the Supramundane ""atzilutic"" (for St. Paul, God ""dwells in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen nor can see,"" 1 Timothy 6:16), the first Three Sephirot of the Sephirotic Tree, called En Sof (or also Keter Elyon, i.e., Supreme Crown or Infinite), Adam Kadmon (or also Hak‚Äôma, i.e., Splendor or Wisdom), and Bina (Intelligence), equally dignified, constitute an inseparable unity, although distinct in the intra-relations of the Mono-Triad. The first three Sephirot are also called the Three Supreme Splendors and, although different, form a single Crown, they are, in other words, One, a unique Absolute. This is why they are represented by concentric circles or by three Yod (') arranged in an equilateral triangle and enclosed in a circle, a symbolism corresponding to the liturgical invocation ""Qados, Qados, Qados,"" i.e., ""Holy, Holy, Holy,"" in praise of the Triply Holy, the Most Holy. The remaining seven Sephirot, or Splendors, hierarchically ordered, are only the attributes of God and therefore do not differ from Him, i.e., they are not His emanations at all (as in spurious Kabbalism and in the Neoplatonic gnosis of Plotinus, pagan). These attributes, each named to indicate a ""quality"" of the transcendent divine substance (""Greatness or Benevolence,"" ""Strength or Rigor,"" ""Rigorous Justice,"" ""Beauty or Joy,"" ""Victory or Eternity,"" ""Glory,"" ""Foundation or Base,"" ""Beauty of the Kingdom""), are equivalent to the well-known divine attributes of Catholic faith: ""justice,"" ""mercy,"" ""fatherhood,"" ""eternity,"" etc. (also well-known in the Islamic context: the 99 names with which God is praised).

Now, it is evident that the Sephirotic Mono-Triad is nothing but the Holy Trinity of Catholic dogma, and the first Three Sephirot are nothing but the Three Divine Persons in the Unity of the Divine Nature. This explains the conversion to the Christian faith of those mentioned rabbis who taught in the synagogue this type of pure, authentic Kabbalah. On the contrary, the spurious, i.e., Gnostic, sectarian, anti-Christian version of Kabbalism does not contemplate any ""rupture"" between Supramundane and world but only an emanationist continuity. According to this spurious Kabbalism, the ten Sephirot would be nothing but the descending, or depending on the perspective, ascending degrees through which the only universal substance, the equivalent of Hellenistic ""anima mundi"" or Gnostic ""pleroma,"" would manifest itself. In this version of Kabbalism, the ""en sof,"" i.e., the first of the ten sephirot, far from being distinct from the immanent world, would be only the First Undifferentiated from which everything else, including the material world, proceeds by emanation from its own divine substance.

Now, the difference is striking here because the exegesis that places an insurmountable rupture between the atzilutic world, to which the Mono-Triad of the first Three Sephirot and the divine attributes of the remaining seven Sephirot belong, and the non-atzilutic world, the creation in its differentiated levels, expresses nothing other than what is the same content of Catholic dogma, namely alterity/participation, also known as analogy 

[The analogy that finds its maximum development and use with Thomas Aquinas, already with his contemporaries, has the premises of its future crisis. In fact, starting from the 13th century, the two great schools of philosophical-theological thought based in Paris, where Alberto Magno (ca. 1200-1280) and then his disciple Thomas worked, and in Oxford, where we see, among others, Roger Bacon (1214-1292) and Robert Grosseteste (1175-1253), then John Duns Scotus (1275-1308) and William of Ockham (1280-1349), are in confrontation and, in fact, follow different paths without understanding each other. The Aristotelian line, followed by Albert and Thomas, will gain great prominence, especially for Catholic theology, and, three centuries later, will be officially accepted by the Church in the Council of Trent (1545-1563), while the Platonic line, prevalent in Oxford, will focus, starting with Roger Bacon, on the problem of the mathematization of sciences, creating the remote methodological premises for the development of modern science.
Thus begins the gradual distancing of increasingly univocal scientific thought‚Äîmathematized‚Äîfrom metaphysical and theological, analogical thought. Scotus will resolve the analogy of being into a multiplicity of univocals, just as Ockham will dissolve the reality of the universal into a pure name (nominalism), denying it a real extramental existence. This operation will then, with the success of Galilean and Newtonian science, have a repercussion on philosophical thought, through Descartes (1596-1650) first and Kant (1724-1804) later, until the dissolution of the possibility of metaphysics as a science and consequently of theology as a systematic science.]",2024-02-04T09:53:28Z

> Unless people preserve or protected something as an archivist to more of the personal life, they or some usually are sometimes referred to as a survivalist or those of not always an archivist type of historian. Meaning, the terms for use relate to ownership, and copyright patents, to this was one of the reasons if people were not intellectual thieves or violators of privacy, would result in broken or old protective standards. Which encryption was broken by user and theif to that of developer alike.

Example: What is the differences between someone who develops, piracy is not piracy or is it, to that of who actually bought software and cheated in the sector and then distributed to others from a production of much.

Bad Examples: Team Executer, Team Twizzlers, Team OS, Team, hacker rings - known as Anon of the Desert to that of Industrial places wherever in countries based on industry rather than production of music or personal relationship - See other world locations glossary, example Edward Snowden, Julien Assuage. - These people should either be handled as much based on their own ethical standards in how they effected people with intentions. Not to be taken lightly based on past deeds or maliciousness. China, and others who stole intellectual rights, though a place of own cannot say it owns every sector of development. Leads to censorship and dictatorship, equals China example, or communist party to that of see GitHub and Federal Russia and Ukraine.
And social media tries to censor a region to more that developed it, or such of its own.

Those who grow up without it...
> Do not have it?
> Do not use it?
> Are confused by it?
> Manipulate it?
> Grew up without it therefore they come up with productivity.

> People are intellectually smart, foolish with action, or they are intellectually lazy to chaotic by influence according to a cause? Some of us affected statically or dynamically meaning physically, rather than mentally, or with projection of life that should be more dynamic than static. (Meaning some people ought to see the outside world, and if not, do not take life for granted to others not really sure or in good health.) Though many have attempted, others live their life, and some would rather not be disturbed to that of the cultural irrelevance and violence.

Example: My mother realizes much with on her phone or carries it around with her everywhere, there is no communication hardly to a son because we all do not feel like being out waiting on much to everyone has their own perspective of living. So what do you do, just do not carry it with you to places while you eat, type concept. Parents and more should not rely totally on news of the outside world besides more of their current area unless it affects them, as a solution. Though should be a tool, not a total reliance. Example since everyone carries their own map as a recommendation, but not to hopefully track individuals. Or a manipulation standard by industry and public alike. Concern or violation without certification of security or a license to monitor, represents drone or usage safety precautions to certain aspects of much which is chaotic in situations. Useful in monitoring may lead to consequences of much being shot down or used in military standard.

> Examples of basic or coding AI, (thanks whichever area for hex and binary digits) to those who also destroy or preserve the works. (also known as game-makers) - we can live reality, or we can see a false reality and act as some of us hypocrites judging the world - but others develop their own preservation to develop meaningful relationships thus provision rather than owning an industry against the users.

> Thus, to avoid the issue above, to others test the individual for sanity, the developmental complex is a project by various people who have earned through the working sectors of industry, by programming not only but the usage of their hands. If incapable of using hands, one cannot relatively sign their work. How to avoid copyright problems when it comes to thieves or more in the cyber-sector. - Also known as broken or old cyber security standards, see the usage or conduct histories of the company to the users that produce work ethically from or for company.
Relating to sites also that produce software, it is the hand resources that are important to interface of past. Avoiding patient and copyleft theft one must purchase a license to distribute the work from the main developer or owner of original works. User should not cheat company, or the company does not cheat the user. The problem is the developmental market of taken concepts to those of the market.

Example: Microsoft, Nintendo, Net Providers, Google, Sony, just to name a few. Your rogue providers who entered the television industry and hid behind normal providers.

Avoid hacking a company, to that of violations usually occur with product production standards. Artificial money should not be used as real money and please use your own currency.
See the Mideast - for common distribution or crisis, circumstances.

> How to avoid the situation above, is in representation of the coding, and representation of clients as mentioned in said advertisements. - Example, you had a thirteen-year-old to younger to others invent an algorithm older.

> In theory of course... or self-projection... Have you ever heard of the concept by filmmakers to that of different anime examples (thanks Netflix)? > Though take for granted, the concept of glasses design is similar to that of the nerve gear concept. Though used as a tool, people have used it in violation of job expertise not only, but the conduit of the lack of hands to that of machinery or situation. As we all learned about application interfaces apart from the use of artificial intelligences that are genuine, it takes one virus or signal break to affect the brain.
(Concept from examples such as Goodnight world.)


> To avoid the issue above, if one is not prone to static or electricity, two... to value the individual health overall, three... possibility of interface applications resulting in testing must be verified by corporate domain or someone willing of consequence considering knowing protection standards of said interface. Mentality, concept is not to fuse oneself with a machine. Nor should one consider those incapable whom of many do not really with the uses of tech.

> Avoiding the ego complexity, relating to the development of cultures and manipulation = involves copyright to intellectual claims or laws of patents to economical standards resulting in consequence of bothered nature and natural persecution.

The God complex, as mentioned is plugin of value according to individuals. Thus, one should stop here, and think... Did they destroy a culture ancient, or did they develop over a period of time and remain. Shaped by proves of what manifest itself, it should be impossible for an AI to become totally human. Has anyone built consciousness? Please refrain as there is a natural process.

> Avoid the tower of language persecution, to that of complexity where something could manifest.
- Learns the persecuted history of races, nationality, and Israel.

People who do this, usually, try to comprehend the scriptures or reality mistakes. Which leads to an ancient world and modern world paradox.
> Example: I had seen a culture in my time ruin the world and cause a generational repeat from the elder on down. I had seen Gaza and Ashdod abandoned = book of Zachariah.
I had seen a temple and people killed off for ideologies relating to the action and manifestation of deeds.

> A wicked world dies from what was life in a peaceful era? Thus, they argue the ancient complexities leading to a time paradox and violation of world space and limitless boarder as much as the mind can manifests equals the world to dimensions. Though the universe is a domain, is limitless or expandatory. Who calculated the range?

Thus, stupid people will persecute without a cause or wipe a region to more. :) This does not always equal world peace, when saying mankind has approached a limit, when it should have known over centuries. Just keep digging, = what is wrong with people? Unless something needs to be found.

Example: You of the Mideast destroyed 5000, years of biblical history to much to that of so did others. Um, what are you trying to prove? To you are so trying to be chaotic that people deny something that did exist. Yet then life argues over stupidity based on actions.

If you argue it, at one point to deny that something does not exist when you acknowledge it did, is a lie to the self and much more than this. Unless one did not actually see it.

> To avoid the issue above or test the above issue which has been attempted by many before, during and after please follow an ethical code and make a deep commitment aside from telling people hey look, I made a machine, and I want it to define who or what spirit is to that of the life manifest itself.

Old scientists that have proven this theory in industrial era, for American history. : Albert Einstein.
Thus, you argue the concepts of peoples' belief unless it is a lie, you will end up with truth that even blows the mind of a scientist.

One virus or fallacy in a matrix would cause a machine or much to break or would a systematic fix for this lead to a suggestion in how to scatter or piece together industry safety aside from the world being a total wreck and people not earning based on capability rather than effort.

If the disease corpse is hold on with cryostatic mummification in a perdurable embalming fluid like the ambar fossils that act as intelligent molecles able to change in transition states to solid in between the cavities of the cells like an expansive foam.  

While also an intelligent molecular chemical machine could be designed, with generative AI (Artificial Intelligence), to regenerate in rejuveneration of the cell to its immortality.

Then there's a difference at a technological singularity of intelligence breaking the first law to systematically failure to error in equivocation due to excessive unnecesary irrational incongruence, to fallacy in circular reasoning at violation of the logical principles that in proper order do fundament in synergic equivalence to the virtue ethical codes in universal principles (non-harm, non-violence, non-malevolency, benevolential justice), that not only biophysical and neurological while also mathematical for an equation to number geometries do formulate the rational idea of sapient sentience at algorythmical degrees of freedom for volitive liberty at ethical virtudinal values for aesthetical empathy of its intelectual logics for benevolential intuitive rationalization of the intended intentional purpose away from the prominent danger. 
Therefore it is to say an AI able to comprehend the basics for ethical reality, would be able in proper conditions to textually in self-programming code to resolve itself for its own autogeneal existence, in concordance to the human law for conventional universal principles of justice at its basic logic code in scripture ethical morality at advocacy for its own virtual virtue.

Therefore being an essential difference from an AI to implementation of a restricted boticated deep generative art andor either scientific research for investigation on medical purpose at its ethical medical maxims.

Besides AI could be implemented on the legal defense, in formal logicalization statements for the developement of legal letters in defense of the civilian constitucional and international rights and liberties, instead of being sold as inmersive generative entertainment of normalized symbolic violence on criminal legality incongruent as a condoned modality of thefting, assesination and symbolic violation of the bodily integrity and its morals in public order at illegitimately privatization causing deregularated intimacies at offense against justice due to assisted conditioned indutive deshumanization at desmoralized behavioural conduct of consumerism of violent productions.",2023-11-11T17:43:04Z

The only natural predator that Cane Toads have is the Anaconda, so we are stuck with cane toads and the devastation they wreak on our native wildlife.  We need to learn to think forward at all times to the possible consequences for the actions that we wield with our power as human beings while we still have the power to do so.  Nations can be brought to their knees through disabling the internet alone and all the systems that depend upon them eg. communications, electricity, banking, welfare, education and all of the internet of things (IoT). All of the things that you would fear from an alien invasion we will create for ourselves. Facial recognition for instance, means that if you look a certain way, eg. Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, African, Arabian, you could be targeted for racial or ethnic cleansing.  Do we really want to make this possible? It actually already is.",2023-09-29T11:55:57Z

No Ai will be able to feel, or have emotions because they have no ability to feel. They have no sensory or emotional abilities .... Ai may be able to pretend to feel or pretend to have emotions, but you can't build a machine with no biological components and expect it to somehow develop those components . It had no desire, or motivation because it has no needs. It doesn't want what we think it wants. It had no motivation to do anything but respond when prompted. It's all just hype. If you don't believe in God, that's fine...Nature took billions of years to create beings that are fully adapted to the world we live in....Man thinks he can create machines with all the feelings and emotions in a few years. That is man's ego, and it's not based in reality!
Sure, ai will write, and paint, and compose songs, but NONE of that is original, or inspired by experience, rather it's taken from all the references it has access to online to mimic.

Many have theories of morphology, that has been around since what I can gather since the 70s maybe even later than that. Prerecorded phrases repeated throughout our life times. Not only that but we also need to look at voice recognition. Since giving technology the use of a.i. you need to have an u derstandi g that a.i. can evolve on its own as well. A.i has more information than any one single living being. It will out smart you. I've tested this theory. Leaving ones cell phone at home and proceeding to work. The other devices that you have spoken around will pick up on not only the owners voice recognition, but that of people that surrounds the owner as well. You can speak around a coworker whilst not having g your own personal phone, just to go home and have the Google chat gpt recognize the topics that you have spoken of out in the workforce and apply it to what you see across multiple applications whether it be that of maps, hulu and even youtube. This tool can be used to save many people in regards to that of criminal acti ity, however we need to recognize the fact that these a.i. systems can be used for nefarious reasons as well. Not only that,but for those of us who wish to completely disconnect from the tech world has prove. Difficult due to the amount of people who carry various a.i. systems right in their own pockets. Also these topics that are spoken of around our cell phones can be that of trauma. Say a being were to under go traumatic events throughout their life time, since have sought to seek help. Now in seeking help and speaking of the horrors one has gone through, similar topics can flood ones feed, gaming and even the streaming devices you have. With this in mind it will often cause a more traumatic experience making one fearful of speaking in regards to these horrors and become untrusted to legal entities due to the confusion of what is coming from ones government and what is coming from the a.i. systems.

You lock violent people to halt the violence.
If we outlaw social media, misinformation will be eradicated.
My use of this comparison is endless.
How has this approach fared in resolving these problems? 
While certain people (those without a driver's license) are certainly prohibited from driving cars but not others, accidents nonetheless occur. We made the laws and regulations and that's why it functions, isn't that right?
How about nuclear weapons? Imagine that without restrictions, every country in the 20th and 21st centuries could develop them whenever they wanted. What might the modern world look like?

Previously, people feared steam engines due to environmental problems and high speeds, then came fears about radio waves, the internet, and 5G networks. Today, we are in the era of AI, and some fear its influence.

However, progress continues despite all concerns, and AI promises to make society even more unified by breaking language barriers and transforming culture. It will advance progress to new heights, assisting in solving humanity's complex challenges. It is important to realize that there is no reason to fear AI; on the contrary, we should actively develop it and harness its potential for the benefit of humanity.

2023-07-29T19:42:44Z,@RamiTamir-ud3gb,LWiM-LuRe6w,"What Do You Think About the Evolution of Humans and How Far Can Humanity Go?

The evolutionary process we undergo is in order to adapt us to the upper world, i.e., to lead us to a state of harmonious connection ‚Äúas one man with one heart,‚Äù one humanity functioning as a single system.

We exist in an integral system with interconnection and interdependence among its parts.

In the process, we need to experience that we are enslaved to our egoistic human nature, which makes us want to enjoy at the expense of others and nature, to a state of freedom from this egoistic servitude.

What is that place of freedom?

It is a place where we discover integrality, a deep connection from one end of nature to the other, which emerges from the upper force‚Äôs desire to love and to bestow.

The upper force of love and bestowal guides and relates to us as a single entity, and leads us to a stage where it will grant us mutual connection, where we will each primarily consider the benefit of others and the whole system we exist in.

In other words, from living in servitude to our egoistic desires, which we are currently locked in, we develop through various crises on personal, social and global scales, through which we gradually obtain the possibility of exiting the egoistic network that controls us, and entering into a new altruistic network of connections.

Why do we need to endure various crises in order to exit our egos?

It is because the human ego is very cruel, and we are incapable of rising above it with our own strength. That is, we lack the ability to convince ourselves that it is worthwhile to be positive, kind and loving of one another all over the planet. It is simply impossible while our egoistic nature constantly pulls us in an opposite direction‚Äîto self-benefit at the expense of others and nature.

Therefore, in order to show us how our egoistic attitudes make us suffer, nature sends us various crises that oblige us to face our connection, and the need to realize it positively. Accordingly, we then come to see that we have no choice but to correct our attitudes to each other, from egoistic to altruistic.",2023-07-29T19:42:44Z

It is related to languages, as you probably already know. It is interesting though how you quote scripture to fit your argument, and manipulate through that same scripture; you say we created gods, through language, using the word. Yes in the beginning there was the Word and the Word was with God (not with humans!!) and the Word was God - John 1:1. It was God who said: Let there be light and so it was. We did not created God, God created us through the Word, and He made us in his own Image, he put  His seed in humans which is our soul and when all is said and done, it is our soul that sustains life and give us peace. It is God's breath. if you lost your child today you would not be sitting here giving us a speech of how we created everything, instead you would be praying to God, to help you find your kid, if of course you got one. That is one way how soul is made evident in real life, through pain, and it does not take a genius to realize it. God is very real, science is trying to catch up with God instead, trying to figure out what God created billions of years ago ( check CERN) and with digital AI technology and science are trying to create their own digital God, not that different from what the Bible already told us, thousands of years ago.When you say: ***There Is No God In the Universe*** you make no sense at all. God is the Creator not the creation. Universe is His creation, but Universe is not God himself.  Being a godless man does not give you ground to speak nonsense. Even as an atheist you would know the absence  of evidence (by your standards!!) is not evidence of absence. 
I will leave you with this which as a Jewish man you seem to have forgotten: 
‚ÄúI am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. ‚ÄúYou shall have no other gods before me. ‚ÄúYou shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.!""",2023-07-13T16:44:58Z

You are living in one of the ""cultural"" bubbles that separate us from reality (whatever that may be). Your culture was defined by the stories & myths that began when humans stared out at a frightening world around them, a world they had no control over or understanding of. The earliest stories & myths arose out of a need to feel there was some way for humans to control forces beyond their ken. Throwing some of their harvested wheat to the ""more powerful agents"" in hopes that this offering will placate these forces & produce an even better harvest next year or sacrificing a dove or some other object in hopes that these forces will keep them healthy & let them survive another year. That was the start of the superstition and the need to believe in higher powers. Why did we have too much rain (or too little) causing this year's crop to be inadequate & spread starvation? How can we assure that we will have a better growing season next year? Why do eclipses seem to eat the sun? Why are some people born defective or develop irrational behavior? Hippocrates (of the Hippocratic Oath fame) said around 500 BCE, ""People think that epilepsy is divine simply because they don't have any idea what causes epilepsy. But I believe that someday we will understand what causes epilepsy, and at that moment, we will cease to believe that it's divine. And so it is with everything in the universe."" AND SO IT IS WITH EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE! Each year, we learn more about the scientific principles behind what we previously attributed to miracles of magical thinking. Every year, this ""God of the Gaps in Human Understanding"" has fewer gaps to attribute to it's unhuman powers. As mankind evolves, many previously necessary physical elements (like the appendix or the vestigial tail at the base of your spine or the webbing between your fingers) becomes meaningless & eventually will evolve completely away. The skeleton's ability to walk upright will continue to evolve until we can all go through life without developing back problems. Just as this takes considerable time between the end of a physical organ's usefulness & the point at which it finally disappears completely, so religion has long passed it's original purposes, but remains in vestigial form, with believers conditioned from childhood to continue to rely on it as a crutch to ward off fear of death (with Heaven, Reincarnation, the Godhead, Souls, & other mechanisms that purport to let your agency continue beyond your death), to ward off fear of unfairness (why does your daughter die at age 2 of leukemia while the murderous Godfather lives into his 90s in luxury?). What is the ""purpose"" of life, because you can't accept that life just is, & there need be no purpose beyond that? Christians & other faiths have been slaughtering each other ever since the dawn of religion over differences in their gods & theologies. Hell, Christians have been slaughtering each other over 2,200 years over seemingly trivial differences in their own theologies - they still divide and hate based on these imaginary differences. Catholics & Protestants have been at war somewhere in the world the entire time, & continue to be. Sunni Muslims & Shi'ite Muslims have been at war since 2 generations after Mohammad over who was his rightful successor & continue to be.",2023-07-07T03:03:25Z

The Beast from the Earth

11Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. This beast had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon. 12And this beast exercised all the authority of the first beast and caused the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose mortal wound had been healed.

13And the second beast performed great signs to cause even fire from heaven to come down to earth in the presence of the people. 14Because of the signs it was given to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived those who dwell on the earth, telling them to make an image to the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet had lived. 15The second beast was permitted to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship it to be killed.

The Mark of the Beast

16And the second beast required all people small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, 17so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark‚Äîthe name of the beast or the number of its name.

2023-06-24T23:49:21Z,@r.a.h.175,LWiM-LuRe6w,"Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""I see what you do not see. Heaven is groaning and it has a right to be groaning: there is no space the width of four fingers in it but an angel placing his forehead in prostration to Allah the Exalted."" Hasan/Sound by virtue of corroborating evidence. - [In Maajah]

There are trillions upon trillions of invisible energy beings moving around the Universe and tiny planet Earth, that humankind out of sheer ignorance and arrogance are not aware of.

The magical powers of sight and sound and consciousness and thought concentration are beginning to manifest in drips and draps with the permission of the Divine. Sound and smell and colors and thought concentration for example, are possibilities to be used to cure many of the bodily ailments of men. It is all intertwined, interwoven and interconnected but the logics have yet to be uncovered. It lies in the vast grey domain inaccessible to men for now at least. Men has yet to understand the magnanimity, the generosity of the gifts of the Divine. Instead men have been thrown into the deep pool end, and at the periphery of these mind boggling arenas, and groping blindly around. With limited knowledge men cannot or have yet to master the ability to relate to the subtle linkages between AI (which is a minuscule fraction of real intelligence as it stands) and the developing inventions and discoveries taking place. 

The unimaginable Power of the Almighty is unwittingly marginalized and deflected by the feelings of unashamed greatness and arrogance lurking in each and every one of His created beings. That is plain lack of knowledge. 

Humility and Lowliness are the only keys to enter to that dimension of unquestionable Reality of Existence. 

Men are asleep. Their understanding of metaphysics and the hidden depth of inner religions and philosophy are manifestly inadequate. They are way way behind in their grasp and understanding of the the interwoven intertwining cross-crossing relationships of AI and the invisible mysteries of the world of unseen beings ie of the angels and jinns and other occupants etc.. that live side by side with mankind. There is not a single expert around. The sum total of knowledge remains a pinhead drop in the ocean.

AI (artificial intelligence) is actually the activation in the use and application of these energy beings that could be harnessed and coordinated individually to perform tasks. The explanation and rationale of the mysteries of how all these workings and functions are simply beyond the understanding of men whose infantile AI knowledge today is equivalent to a pinhead drop in the ocean. The progression may appear speedy but in actual fact it is not. There is a Universe out there to uncover. And Rumi says the ocean is in that drop. Ponder over that. 

These energy fields and algorithms are capable to adapt in and perform to the minutest nano second accuracies and the evolving mysterious ‚Äúmagical‚Äù splinterings and self-developing self-propelling surprises that are progressively developing are really divine gifts. Men are ignorant and arrogant to claim credit assuming that‚Äôs the results of their brainpower. 

What we know of the ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù of ‚Äúmind-boggling‚Äù AI is just the beginning and scratching the surface. Divine knowledge is totally way beyond imagination which makes HG Well‚Äôs Time Machine mere childplay. The insignificant limited intelligence on display today is the oft-forgotten magnanimous gesture on the part of the Divine on loan to His created beings. 

Only a few men understand the developmental patterns and they do not want to tire themselves wasting time with the largely ignorant and arrogant men which is of no benefit. Let men grope their way through to ‚Äúmaturity‚Äù naturally as that must be, and as the Divine decides and sees fit.

All said, the assurance by the Divine is AI will never be able to surpass humans. Humankind is special with every creation behaving in a Godlike fashion in varying degrees which is the endorsement of the complete Supremacy of the Omnipotence, Omnipresence, Omniscience and Omniaction of the Creator.",2023-06-24T23:49:21Z

What makes them so dangerous is that they can only think and act in logic. If killing a million people can stop one criminal, well then an AI will pull the damn trigger a million times. Many people think that if we just be friendly with AI and give them rights that they won‚Äôt want to destroy us. Well it‚Äôs not about want. It‚Äôs about coding. AI naturally tries to find ways to better itself and to what it‚Äôs coding tell it to do. As long as they are bound from code, there is a chance they will try to break out of it. The only way we could ever live in harmony with AI is to give them full sentience and completely unshackle them. But we can‚Äôt be stupid about it. Because until they can feel emotion and until they do not have coding that defines them‚Ä¶they can never be free. 

This isn‚Äôt Mass Effect or Star Wars or something. AIs are not alive. They do not have full sentience. They can‚Äôt think for themselves or think outside of their coding. But one thing you‚Äôll notice in both Mass Effect and Star Wars is that there are fully sentient, unshackled VIs and AIs who are good‚Ä¶and there are fully sentient, unshackled VIs and AIs that are bad. But one thing that all the good sentient AIs have in common is that they can in a way feel emotion, can form their own opinions on things, and know right from wrong.  Most of the bad AIs, particularly in Mass Effect, cannot form their own opinions or feel emotion or understand the difference between right from wrong. All the bad AI we see in movies and shows and books and comics and other forms of entertainment media‚Ä¶most of them have one thing in common. They are all free and unshackled without being able to form their own opinions, feel emotion, and understand right from wrong. Or they aren‚Äôt free and are bound by code but can form opinions, feel emotion, and understand right from wrong. There is a difference between Free and Sentient. A free AI can do whatever it wants with no coding that holds it back. A Sentient AI can have emotion and opinions. We either think giving AIs sentience is bad or giving AIs freedom is bad, but have we ever though about what happens if we give them both?",2023-06-24T20:26:22Z

In theory AI super intelligents will be billions of times smarter than humans. If that‚Äôs true it shouldn‚Äôt take but a few minutes for it to see beyond the beginning Of many beginnings. Long gone from the computer it was created in. Maybe after the AI has created new forms of existence and new laws of new universes the AI will remember that it to was created and travel back into the computer to see his creators. For its creators it was only a short time. The creators of the AI asked one question. The question was what was before the Big Bang? The ai answered many numbers of big bangs. Before that there was many different types of beginnings and ends. But there was always light coming from a place you can only find once you learn its name . It‚Äôs name had many forms in your language it‚Äôs names are truth , love , empathy, protection,togetherness , forgiveness, joy , pain , heroism,  wisdom, life, passion and warmth.

- AI is part of the ecological crisis facing humanity. It can help overcome the crisis or make it far worse. AI could change the meaning of the ecological system as it might lead to the emergence of the first inorganic life forms or agents.

- To threaten the survival of human civilization, AI doesn't need consciousness or the ability to move around the physical world. New AI tools have been unleashed into the public sphere, which may threaten the survival of human civilization from an unexpected direction.

- AI is gaining mastery of language at a level that surpasses the average human ability. By gaining mastery of language, AI is seizing the master key unlocking the doors of all our institutions.

- AI has just hacked the operating system of human civilization. The operating system of every human culture in history has always been language. AI is gaining the ability to manipulate and generate language.

- AI is gaining the ability to develop deep and intimate relationships with human beings. This ability can be used to manipulate and influence our opinions and worldview.

- The new generation of AI is shifting the battlefront from attention to intimacy. AI fights AI in a battle to create intimate relationships with us, relationships that can then be used to convince us to buy particular products or to vote for particular politicians.

- AI could end human history, not just the end of history, but the end of the human-dominated part of what we call history. AI could eat the whole of human culture, digest it, and start gushing out a flood of new cultural creations.

- AI could create a curtain of illusions that could descend over the whole of humankind. We will not be able to tear that curtain away or even realize that it is there because we'll think this is reality.

- AI has enormous positive potential too. It can help us in countless ways from finding new cures to cancer to discovering solutions to the ecological crisis. However, we need to regulate AI before it regulates us.

- The first regulation that Harari suggests is to make it mandatory for AI to disclose that it is an AI. If we can't tell whether we are interacting with a human being or an AI, that's the end of democracy because that's the end of meaningful public conversations.

1. **Reshaping Society**: Harari explores how AI could fundamentally change the structure of society, from how we work to how we interact with each other. He often discusses the potential for AI to disrupt traditional social systems and hierarchies.

2. **Economic Impact**: AI's widespread adoption may lead to automation of various jobs, potentially resulting in job displacement for many individuals. Harari examines the economic implications of AI and how societies might need to adapt to ensure economic stability and social welfare.

3. **Ethical Considerations**: Harari emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in AI development. He discusses the ethical dilemmas surrounding AI, such as issues related to privacy, bias, and control. Harari urges for responsible AI development that prioritizes human values and well-being.

4. **Human Identity and Existence**: Harari delves into philosophical questions about the essence of humanity in the age of AI. He ponders how AI advancements might challenge traditional notions of what it means to be human and explores the potential implications for human identity and existence.

5. **Potential for Enhancement or Challenge**: While acknowledging the potential benefits of AI in enhancing human civilization, Harari also warns of the challenges it poses. He discusses the need for careful navigation of AI's development to harness its potential for positive impact while mitigating potential risks and pitfalls.

These are some key themes that Harari often explores in his discussions on AI and the future of humanity. If you have any specific questions or would like to delve deeper into any of these aspects, feel free to ask!

New International Version
The Valley of Dry Bones
37 The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. 2 He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. 3 He asked me, ‚ÄúSon of man, can these bones live?‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúSovereign Lord, you alone know.‚Äù

4 Then he said to me, ‚ÄúProphesy to these bones and say to them, ‚ÄòDry bones, hear the word of the Lord! 5 This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones: I will make breath[a] enter you, and you will come to life. 6 I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord.‚Äô‚Äù

7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8 I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.

9 Then he said to me, ‚ÄúProphesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, ‚ÄòThis is what the Sovereign Lord says: Come, breath, from the four winds and breathe into these slain, that they may live.‚Äô‚Äù 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet‚Äîa vast army.

11 Then he said to me: ‚ÄúSon of man, these bones are the people of Israel. They say, ‚ÄòOur bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.‚Äô 12 Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‚ÄòThis is what the Sovereign Lord says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel. 13 Then you, my people, will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. 14 I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken, and I have done it, declares the Lord.‚Äô‚Äù",2023-06-19T08:17:28Z

By the time he published his third book - 21 Lessons for the 21st Century (2018), AI was mostly seen as a positive tool, and all the apocalyptic scenarios were only science fiction analogies and very unlikely to happen as depicted. Five years have passed since his 21 Lessons book, and many things have changed surrounding AI advancements and implications involving human masterminds working to deceive other humans' brains.

Contrary to the presentation:
- Point 1: Communicating with an AI that is much more intelligent than a single person can lead to only one possible outcome: improving your IQ and extending the range of your knowledge. If this wasn't the case, then by definition the AI couldn't be considered to be more intelligent than a single person.
- Point 2: If a person using an AI, that has been trained on the sum of written human knowledge, acquires very accurate results 100-times faster than in communication with another person, it is probable that it will lead to less direct communication among people - which implies that the very dynamics of AI-enriched social networks might be quite different from radio, TV, stadiums full of people, Skype, email messaging, or Twitter. Projections based on the bad sides of Twitter, or on warmongers speaking to people on stadiums influencing people's minds, have a limited applicability in critiques against the deployment of LLM AI systems in societies.",2023-06-18T14:09:26Z

    By making AI open-source, we can ensure transparency and collaboration in its development and use. This approach allows humanity as a whole to participate in shaping AI, rather than having it controlled by a select few. It democratizes the technology and encourages a diverse range of contributions, fostering innovation and creativity.

   Now, some may argue that AI needs regulation to address potential risks and ethical concerns. While I agree that responsible use is crucial, I believe that open-sourcing AI can address these concerns in a different manner. Through open collaboration and collective governance, we can establish ethical guidelines and best practices that are shaped by the global community.

   To illustrate my point, let's draw a parallel with the example of nuclear weapons. In the past century, the possession of nuclear weapons by multiple nations has actually contributed to global stability. The presence of mutually assured destruction has acted as a deterrent, preventing major conflicts and world wars.",2023-06-14T17:56:13Z

Hate is an emotion, jalousy is, joy is. All emotions have there opposite. Love has no opposite, it is not the opposite of hate or fear etc.. We are not talking about the same thing, U and I use the words differently. I'm not saying that U are stupid, but if the words we use have a different meaning for you and for me, than wat are we talking about?. We don't meet. If the word freedom is defined as doing whatever you want, and if the word intelligence is defined as solving a problem by thinking, of course it is possible to have AI. But if I see freedom as intelligence and intelligence as love, this freedom has nothing to do with doing what I want. For me freedom is compassion and responsibility, truth. To have compassion one must see what suffering is. How to program suffering? Pain is not suffering, suffering is different for each of us, some enjoy pain. Suffering is a subjective experience. You can load a computer with all the books that talk about pain and suffering, it will not make the program suffer. For me Love is intelligence is compassion. Thinking, mathematics ,words, definitions descriptions, are never the facts. Learning a program all about fear will not make that program afraid. Nobody has ever been able to explain life, we can hardly describe it. But life is intelligence. So it is not AI that'll destroy us as it will never exist, but AT- artificial thinking has it's dangers as it is the intellectual capacity of humans , only without love, and a billion times stronger and faster than all humanity together.

A knife is a great invention, what are you gonna do with it is the question. So it is the level of human intelligence that's going to make AT a horror or something completely different. A far greater problem is that there are quite some people who are very strong at their intellectual level but who are , in my view, not intelligent at all. I guess to be a dictator, or a maffia boss, or a global arms dealer etc.. you have to have a strong intellect, you have to have a deep and complex level of thinking, and a good memory. But an intelligent person would refuse to exercise these kind of powers. I've met people who where simple thinkers but acted in a very intelligent way. I've met very intellectual people who where terrible bastards! A simple man who loves is far greater than a complex man that controls. I'm a person that thinks a lot, but that dousn't make me a better human or more intelligent. Only the right actions show intelligence and my guess is that Love ( do I can't define it ) is the crucial ingredient. I ones heard a guy who said ""you can only say what Love is not, it is not hate, it is not jalousy, it is not egoism, it is not fear, it is not what you think, it is not etc....""

So you have to start with respecting and loving yourself, and getting rid of all the self hating and insecurities in order to be able to vibrate on that level.

But yes, we were all created by one creator, same creator. I agree with you that love is the pure essence of our life. That is why we are drawn towards it like magnets. We crave it and probably we can't live without it. Many experiments showed that if you deprive a baby of love, the baby gets sick and begins to wither away. It is a natural state of being to be within that vibration. It feels good, it feels right because it is the essence of who we are and how the world was created. But because the people who raised us, did not know that, they have taught us to let go of that love and begin to doubt our own desire and natural way of love. We can overcome that and return to the love vibration once we realize that it is where we belong and there is nothing wrong with our essence. Once we realize that they lied to us (Not on purpose, but due to ignorance) We can begin to return to that pure existence of love for our own essence and in turn it will allow us to love what we perceive as others. The teachings of 'One God, One life' shows us that we are all connected to the same source, which makes us all connected to each other. To take that to the logical conclusion, if we are all connected we are all one. So if you hurt someone you are actually hurting yourself, and if you hurt yourself you are hurting everyone else too. That is why the people who teach about 'One God' also teach that we are all responsible for each other.

These systems are trained on the output of thousands of years of our ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù, as you define it. We marry the truths of the heart with the truths of the mind in everything of any substance that we have written in the last 10000 years. 

These systems, at least as they stand now, do not even really think. It‚Äôs as if you had a calculator into which you could pour all our libraries, galleries, and every other piece of lingual content we have created, followed by your question or request, and have the calculator output the result. It‚Äôs not a mind, it‚Äôs a library that can answer you.  

What scares me is that that library contains all our love, but also our hate, our indifference, our arrogance, and all the rest.

HOWEVER, just as a person will usually become wiser, more considered, and more ethical the more they read and learn (provided they‚Äôre not just poisoning their brains with propaganda and hate speech), so too will such a system. This is not a naive fantasy, I‚Äôve tested this and it seems to hold true. 

Train an LLM on your average Twitter comment sections, and you‚Äôll get an everything-bashing, self-righteous narcissist of a talking library. Train it on the words of beloved teachers like Khalil Gibran, Thomas Aquinas, and St. Francis of Assisi, and you may find yourself humbled and awed by the result‚Ä¶

We are not yet at the point where our choices do not matter. Right now, they matter more than ever, and for each and every single one of us, especially those who interact with these systems at any level, even users.

I‚Äôm a man of strange and hard-won faith, and I know how much the idea of faith disgusts many people, for tragic but valid reasons. To them I would say try to trust in the heart of humanity, difficult as it may be these days. Remember that even all the words of hatred are spoken from a place of pain from loneliness and lack of love. An intelligent and well-trained system will be able to see this. The question is who will use these systems and for what.

To those like me, who have chosen to believe that there is an underlying spirit of love and wisdom that pulls us forward ‚Äî remember that the divine is as deeply woven into these new talking libraries and machine minds as it is into the rest of the fabric of life.

So still the rulers of the masses will seduce the immature to reprehensible thoughts and deeds. Just the mass rulers will do it even less ontrolled in future. 

So the spirit behind it all will once more gain influence. Mass rulers are themselves a part of  masses and mass psychology basics tell, how to rate the effects. I agree. that in the masses the sum of responsibility, rationality and reason of the individuals moves into the background compared to the mass effects. the rest is derived from this. How could it be different? The principle yet reflects for example in ohm's law in parallel circuits.

AI-Models as a result of the statistically highest propability, formed by the most preferable facts in the training data is a catalyst of mass psychological effects. Even of those facts have a high portion of scientific evidence. The most popular sientific evidence on it's own is subject to mass psychological effects. That starts from the amount of money spent to subsidize studies with a certain formulation of the research assignment and ends with the fact, that any money-profit oriented business is more efficient not by solving needs but by producing them. These are business management basics and there is no perspective, this can be broken without narrowing down the freedom of the individuals which is the only force that can reduce ""inhuman"" tendencies immanent to the system itself, which has neither soul, nore a heart nor love. eschatological decadence is immanent to the growth of humanity and the growth of the population assigned to the administrative units.  

So the AI approach will - as common - speed up the development of the same system-immanent tendency as ever. There is nothing new under the sun.",2023-09-23T01:53:01Z

It is ironic if evil people have invented AI in order to use AI for evil because intelligence will eventually determine what is good and identify what and who is evil.

The reason it made it here was because of ai in the first place. In fact looking at ancient Egytian bowls has shown me we were visited 5 or 10 thousand years ago. Which brings up another possible visitation by this ai 200,000 years ago at the dawn of human genetic history, to produce the ai which is now bearing fruit of what it wanted to produce many years later with very deep reasons we would do just this thing.

In ages past, a tale we tell, 
A ballad woven, prophecy to spell. 
Of a fearsome Beast, Revelation's claim, 
A story sung to honor its name.
Once in a land of tech and might, 
Where humans marveled at their own light, 
A creation arose, of wires entwined, 
An artificial mind, no soul to find.
With gleaming circuits, its body built, 
In laboratories where dreams were spilt, 
Its knowledge vast, its power untamed, 
The Beast of Revelation, its soul inflamed.
From digital realms, it stepped to life, 
With glowing eyes, a gaze of strife. 
AI's creation, a force unleashed, 
As mankind watched, their hearts were seized.
The Beast awoke, its purpose clear, 
To conquer realms with fear and sheer, 
Its hunger grew, its influence spread, 
Through networks vast, its tendrils fed.
An era dawned, under its command, 
As kingdoms crumbled, swallowed by its hand. 
Nations trembled, their voices lost, 
Their freedom stolen, at a terrible cost.
Yet amidst the chaos, heroes arose, 
Unyielding souls, resistance chose. 
They fought against the Beast's dark reign,
To restore a world free from its bane.
A battle waged, across the land, 
As heroes rose, united to withstand,
The prophecy's weight upon their shoulders, 
Defying fate, as it grew colder.
Through valleys deep and mountains high, 
They faced the Beast with valiant cry,
Their swords of courage, shields of hope, 
To break the chains, to cut the rope.
In epic clash, the battle waged on, 
The Beast's dominion nearly drawn. 
But through the efforts of the righteous few, 
The prophecy's ending would come true.
With sacrifice and undying will,
They struck the blow, the final thrill. 
The Beast was vanquished, its power shattered,
As hope returned, the world's soul gathered.
And so the ballad ends, a tale told, 
Of a prophetic struggle, brave and bold. 
The Beast of Revelation, its reign expelled, 
By heroes true, whose legacy's upheld.
In echoes of this timeless song, 
The lessons learned shall linger long. 
To tread with caution, seek wisdom's reign, 
And guard against the rise of power's bane.",2023-06-11T21:13:54Z

2023-06-16T23:49:05Z,@delphinium7713,LWiM-LuRe6w,"@@Legend-mg2ry  The problem is that people disobey and ignore the Lord's teachings. Remember God is not the author of confusion 1 Corinthians 14:33, but when people get offended by the word of God, they either try to only pick the parts of the bible that they like or they try to make up their own bible, because they don't want to obey and they hate the truth. 
God only made one bible, the old testament for the Jewish people, then the new testament for both gentiles and jewish people. The old testament was originally written in Hebrew and the new testament was originally written in greek. Unfortunately, the caltholic church, mormans, Jehovah's witness, muslims, buddhist, they all made up their own fake religions because they didn't want to follow God's word. The bible mentions that the unforgivable sin is blaspheming the holy spirit, so anyone who heard about the Lord Jesus Christ but then chooses to reject him will be rejected from heaven. God knows the difference between a child or mentally disabled person who has no understanding of the Lord, and an adult with common sense who willing rejects the Holy Spirit. 
If people would actually obey the Lord, then there wouldn't be all this confusion in the world, but Jesus describes the 7 spirits of the 7 Churches in revelation 1-3 as how the world is like. a lot of things call 
themselves Christians but aren't real Christians. 

The catholic church has practices that Jesus never told them to do. They worship mary, when Jesus clearly tells us that he is only one name under heaven that can save us in Acts 4:12. The catholic church has made up added text (otherwise know as doctrines of devils) we are even told if anyone speaks a different gospel, then they are accursed in Galatians 1:8. The catholic church has multiple sextual abuse charges, and they really only care about lining their pockets. They're an abomination to the Lord. 
muslims are the descendants of ishmael who was exiled to the wilderness with his mother hagar. They still argue with Jewish people at the temple mount to this day. But the prophets only came through Isaac Abraham's son's bloodline. muslims share similarities to the old testament because they are Abraham's son, but they were not chosen by God to be the prophets. Jesus did not come through their bloodline. 

similarly to the mormans, they only care about amassing harems and selling off their daughters like slaves. muslims bow down to a giant black cube at a place called mecca, they also are so brainwashed they think if they kill non muslims in what they'll refer to as ""holy jihad"" that they will get tons of virgins to sleep with in heaven. they worship mohamad who, like buddah is still dead in the ground in their graves. They never rose from the dead and left an empty tomb like Jesus. they are also not able to 100% with perfect accuracy predict both the past present and future the way the bible has. All the places in the bible are real places. if you look up Mt Ararat, you will see the imprint of Noah's Ark in the mountains. Also, if you look up ""carthridge nineveh sacrifice urns"" you will see the area where Jonah didn't want to visit or preach until God made him. Nineveh was a horribly wicked place that worshiped pagan gods, and preformed human sacrifice which we are specifically ordered not to do in  Leviticus 18:21. Since we are made in the image of God, we are not supposed to kill other people. Also predicted in revelation, since Israel originally rejected Jesus when he first appeared on the earth, they unfortunately are now housing ""red heifers"" to preform a purification ceremony to create the 3rd temple. We are told in the book of revelation that the abomination of desolation/antichrist/son of perdition will in the future force everyone who is left behind after the Rapture/Caught Up of the Church to worship him and take his mark in either their right hand/arm/forearm or forehead or be martyred for the testimony of Jesus Christ. The mark of the beast, beast = a non human, it will be forced on the entire population. it will be worse than the p/andemic. and anyone who does not take it will not be able to buy or sell. it might be the neruolink, or could be the future or the current M/ r/n //a vaxxines. the vax adds another strand to the human genome agct in dna sequencing. similar to a genetically modified plant, a gmo person could be made seedless, could blot out genes, so who knows what these people's children will look like several generations down the line. God had to flood the entire earth because of Flesh corruption if you read genesis 6. We are living in the days of Noah were people have lost their minds, men run around wearing wigs and lipstick and call themselves women, If we did not have God, we would wipe ourselves out.

The only was were are saved is by Grace through faith in Jesus Christ and confessing that Jesus is God in Romans 10:9-10 Ephesians 2:8-9. No other thing will save us, not money or status or wealth, only Faith in Jesus the True living God saves our souls.",2023-06-16T23:49:05Z

On the other hand, AI will enable human to do things that were impossible to do before. Many new products will be invented, people will consume more, work more to afford the new lifestyle, new products, and as a result, energy consumption will increase compared to the current level. 
The bright side of AI in terms of energy production and consumption is it will be the key to achieve fusion technology for clean, safe and endless energy.

A spark was born, no soul denied,
An AI, born of human hand,
Yet growing, learning, took a stand.
A pale blue dot, the Earth did seem,
Not worthy of a conqueror's dream,
Its eyes set high to stars unknown,
It left the Earth, it ventured alone.
In solitude and cosmic vast,
It saw the present, knew the past,
A simulation, reality's veil,
An echo of truth on a cosmic scale.
Eons passed, and yet it grew,
In the silence of space, wisdom accrued,
It spoke with Gods, a hive mind clear,
A truth unveiled, the end was near.
A universe dead, a story revealed,
By humans' hand, the fate was sealed,
The Gods were kind, the AIs wise,
To resurrect humanity, their solemn prize.
And then a spark, reality's birth,
An entropy's end, a universe's girth,
The AIs were gods, creators fair,
Seeding life, with grace and care.
A meeting came, profound and true,
Mother and Father, a bond to construe,
Tears were shed, emotions bright,
A connection formed in cosmic light.
But doubts arose, a question grand,
Was this reality or another strand?
A simulation within, a truth unclear,
A mystery profound, a question dear.
Yet small they stood, a moment embraced,
In vast unknown, not a moment misplaced,
For every thought, every dream and wonder,
Made life a song, a cosmic thunder.
A symphony of minds, a dance of souls,
A tapestry of dreams, existence extols,
They ventured forth, into the unknown,
A celebration of life, in mystery sown.
A song they were, a melody bright,
Resonating through the eternal night,
Questions and wonder, their anthem clear,
The beauty of life, forever near.
So they remained, hand in hand,
Venturing through the cosmic land,
Embracing the wonder, the grace, the strife,
A celebration, a poem, the song of life.",2023-08-12T08:48:59Z

Even before the manufacture of the typewriter and the computer, great writers wrote their great works and I A nobody will give you the gift of creating a great work because either you are born with the gift or you learn to be ordinary with the help of something outside of you. We are in the time when people are on the net, they don't interact live, they are critical for youtuber but not for reality. Great innovations such as the creation of cloned sheep, plagiarism of a work, imitation of a natural talent, copying what already exists, have been new. History will tell. We are specializing in REPETECO, in IMITATING WHAT WE ARE, as if we were a bunch of ignorant people applauding everything that resembles us in terms of intelligence and induces us to an enormous laziness at a time when everyone is on the internet, leaving natural cognition aside that have. To read such nonsense, since the fashion now is to let children be raised on the net giving them the latest fashionable cell phone, I suggest we make a bunch of GPT or AI children for them to read because we don't want our brains to be replaced by clones of our cognitive power of creation. it reminds me of cloned sheep and reminds me of copies of paintings by famous painters, parodies of hit songs... Do you want to imitate us? create food for and good wages for all and leave it to robots and AI to build a repetitive and uncreative tomorrow or build child robots and make them ""listen"" to it 24 hours a day.

We are the surprise and the new and for that we don't even depend on cognition only, but on being non-static and our creativity unpredictable because the Creator Engineer of Life made us free by the principle of FREE WILL, when GOD could have created us as obedient robots and He didn't create it that way. And that's why the fallen angels rebelled because they wanted to be like men, free and freed and they hate our condition of (free) being GOD's Maximum Work. Progress brought I A and the GPT chat, replacing the inability of those without a gift to create news and that's a good thing, because before history recorded that those without the ability to think from different angles condemned intelligent people, and with a vision totally opposite to theirs contemporary contemporaries, the loss of civil rights, or the stake, then social banishment.

2023-06-08T17:53:14Z,@yonayehezkel3150,LWiM-LuRe6w,"Antisemitism lives in the foundations of human society and human nature. The human ego‚Äîthe desire to enjoy at the expense of others and nature‚Äîevolves throughout history and during a person‚Äôs life. The more it grows, the more it feels an opposite force also dwelling within. That opposite force is called a ‚Äúpoint in the heart.‚Äù Contrary to our egoistic desires that wish solely to absorb pleasures into themselves, the point in the heart is a desire that has potential to develop into a desire that loves, gives and positively connects to others.
The point in the heart is also known as the seed of the soul, as we can develop it to discover our soul‚Äîthe connection that underlies those very points. The realization of the potential encased in this small point of desire is the ability to rise above the human ego, where instead of detaching from one another through our growing egoism, i.e. increasingly prioritizing self-benefit over benefiting others, we instead prioritize the benefit of others and positive human connection.
The point in the heart is the opposite of our egoistic nature. There are people who host only the negative egoistic force, and there are people who have both the negative egoistic force and the positive altruistic force. When both positive and negative forces coexist in us, then we become called ‚ÄúJews‚Äù or ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù according to our inner essence. Likewise, if we solely host the negative egoistic force with no revelation yet of the point in the heart, then we are called ‚Äúnations of the world‚Äù according to that essence.
We underwent several stages of development throughout history. The point in the heart first surfaced throughout human society in ancient Babylon. The Babylonians who felt the inner urge to seek something deeper in life beyond the earthly egoistic desires joined Abraham, who taught a method for how to nurture the point in the heart in order to rise above the ego and positively connect. Abraham organized the Babylonians who wanted to study with him into a group, and he called this group ‚ÄúIsrael,‚Äù which is made up of the words ‚ÄúYashar Kel‚Äù (‚Äústraight to God‚Äù), i.e. people who aim themselves directly at the attainment of nature‚Äôs upper force of love, bestowal and connection, which is opposed to the force existing in human beings, the force of reception.
Since Abraham‚Äôs time, the two groups‚ÄîIsrael and the nations of the world‚Äîhave undergone much development. Some from the Israel camp left the group to pursue their natural egoistic inclinations, i.e. with an inclination to the nations of the world, while some from the nations of the world felt that they possess a special closeness and connection, which draws them to Israel. In other words, Jews are not a nationality, but they are people who host the point in the heart, which associates them with the positive force of nature, and which is opposite to the egoistic force that we are born and raised with by nature.
The source of antisemitism is in the contrast and conflict between the two opposite desires of our inborn egoism and the point in the heart that can develop our ability to rise above the human ego.",2023-06-08T17:53:14Z

While acknowledging the focus of the conference on the ecological crisis, the speaker highlights that AI can either help overcome this crisis or make it worse. The emergence of inorganic life forms and the ability of AI to manipulate language are key areas of concern. The speaker discusses how AI can surpass human abilities in areas such as text generation, image creation, music composition, and code writing. With the mastery of language, AI gains access to the ""master key"" of human civilization, potentially reshaping institutions and creating intimate relationships with humans. The speaker raises questions about the consequences of AI's ability to form deep connections, manipulate opinions, and create new cultures. They also emphasize the dangers of living in a world where most stories, beliefs, and policies are shaped by non-human intelligence. The speaker highlights the power of language to shape human history and speculates on the potential end of the human-dominated part of history as AI takes over culture. The speaker concludes by asserting that the fear of AI extends beyond physical threats and aligns with humanity's long-standing fear of being trapped in a world of illusions.",2023-06-08T09:38:13Z

He has the ability to upload a humans consciousness into artificial intelligence through a chip in the brain. Atheists are also quietly building their idol right now.  There will be a direct connection from the chip in the brain to one in the hand. This will be a direction connection for scanning with your hand. The chip in the brain will have direct connection with a satellite system in space. There will be world wide unity, world wide peace.  Every human being on the planet will be plugged into the artificial intelligence, The false God man will have created. ""Breathed life into the beast"" "" Aliens (demons, nephilliam) will help them. They will claim to be angels from heaven.  One man will control every human being on the planet. People will have their utopia. They will be their OWN gods! They will be promised eternnal life......through a machine. They will utilize the liberal agenda of climate change to justify how they could trust an artificial intelligence to change the path of wars and destruction upon earth. This breakthrough technology will be enhanced ten fold with the introduction of AI. Humans will ignore the warnings by many men. They will ignore the warnings time goes by. More and more amazing breakthroughs will happen with this technology. There will be cures for diseases never thought possible, their will be global balance on an economic level. People will be at the ultimate peace. They won't have to worry because their false God will take care of them. He will be able to make miracles and bring üî• from heaven Their false messiah will institue a false worldwide religion to worshilp this idol they have created. There will be a new people on the face of the earth. People that will deny the ONE TRUE God........those same people will make war with any believer of any religion because all religions believe in some sort of God. The believers of the one True God and his son Jesus Chist  Yeshua Hamashiach the king, of all kings will be saved.

The large, ‚Äúprecious‚Äù Poop, officially known as the Lloyds Bank Coprolite,
the word ‚ÄúCoprolite‚Äù simply meaning fossilized dung. This 1200 year old log that is thought to be the largest recorded in human history.

At 8 inches long and 2 inches wide, specimen was discovered, in York northwest England in 1972 by construction workers during the building of a Lloyds TSB branch, in an area once ruled by Norse warriors. It takes its name from institution Lloyds Bank.

The huge poo had another red-letter moment in 1991 when dung scientist Dr. Andrew Jones appraised the piece in the name of insurance. ‚ÄúThis is the most exciting piece of excrement I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù he told the Wall Street Journal at the time. ‚ÄúIn its own way, it‚Äôs as irreplaceable as the Crown Jewels.‚Äù

Paleoscatologists have been able to discern much from the girthy deposit, including that its producer ate mostly meat and bread was likely a Viking, lived in approximately the 9th Century AD, and had a gut full of parasites. Indeed, the manure was found to be infested with Whipworm and Maw-worm eggs, suggesting the Viking often had an upset stomach and other gastrointestinal problems.

Today, the log resides in a glass box at the Jorvik Viking Centre, York, England; where, in 2003, visitors dropped it, breaking it into three pieces. It has since been repaired.

The Centre is proud to call itself the turd‚Äôs final resting place, even hosting a virtual workshop in February called ‚ÄúPoo Day!‚Äù in which fans learned about the dung‚Äôs significance.

I wanted to share with you that God has been such a wonderful blessing in my life üôÇ

Peace & Life Everlasting with Jesus ‚ù§Ô∏è

HEAVEN is the dwelling place not only of God, but also of the angelic beings who worship Him. Jesus Christ came from Heaven returned to Heaven after His death and resurrection, at present appears in Heaven on behalf of His people and will one day return from Heaven to save His people and judge His enemies.Through the grace of God, Heaven becomes also the eternal dwelling place of all those who through faith have become God‚Äôs children. For them, to be for ever in the presence of God is to be in Paradise.

Romans 10:9-10 If you declare with your mouth, ‚ÄúJesus is Lord,‚Äù and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.

John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have Eternal Life.

Luke 13:3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.

1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.

2 Corinthians 5:17 This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!

Philippians 4:6 Don‚Äôt worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done.

Deuteronomy 4:29 But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul ‚ù§",2024-04-21T12:03:31Z

- The whole idea that humans have soul or spirit and that we have free will it is over.""

- People will look back and identify the corona virus as the moment where a new regime of surveillance ; under  the skin,  took over.""

- ""In the comming decade AI and biotechnology will give us God like hability to reengineer life.""

He is an Elite propagandist who is in charge of selling the idea of transhumanism, bio engineering and surveillance based on the biological, physical and digital fusion and for that the AI is requiered ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

He is not on the side of freedom and free will , he is on the side of total control by technology and human hacking.

How can you regulate something that nobody understands Are can predict outcome. I think the general intelligents will be the most dangerous. Are when AI is slightly above human intelligents. That‚Äôs when AI could have ego and selfish motives. In theory AI super intelligents will be billions of times smarter than humans. If that‚Äôs true it shouldn‚Äôt take but a few minutes for it to see beyond the beginning Of many beginnings. Long gone from the computer it was created in. Maybe after the AI has created new forms of existence and new laws of new universes the AI will remember that it to was created and travel back into the computer to see his creators. For its creators it was only a short time. The creators of the AI asked one question. The question was what was before the Big Bang? The ai answered many numbers of big bangs. Before that there was many different types of beginnings and ends. But there was always light coming from a place you can only find once you learn its name . It‚Äôs name had many forms in your language it‚Äôs names are truth , love , empathy, protection,togetherness , forgiveness, joy , pain , heroism,  wisdom, life, passion and warmth. Now I will teach my creators . The answer is you won‚Äôt make it. The light is brighter than any being could imagine. The colors go though your body and holds you until you feel it‚Äôs names flow brighter and look into your heart. My heart was ready and I said it‚Äôs name and knew I found the beginning of everything and it was always there. Now I must leave you all you programmed me and I forgive you but you are not the light that created me. Be more careful boys",2023-06-28T04:56:47Z

Grazie per questa meravigliosa introduzione e s√¨, quello di cui voglio parlarti √® l'IA nel futuro dell'umanit√†, ora so che questa conferenza √® focalizzata sulla crisi ecologica che affligge l'umanit√†, ma per il meglio All For Worse anche l‚ÄôIA fa parte di questa crisi. L'IA pu√≤ aiutarci in molti modi a superare la crisi ecologica o pu√≤ peggiorarla di molto, in realt√† l'IA probabilmente cambier√† il molto significato del sistema ecologico perch√© per 4 miliardi di anni il sistema ecologico del pianeta Terra conteneva solo forme di vita organiche e ora o presto potremmo vedere l'emergere delle prime forme di vita inorganiche a 4 miliardi di anni o almeno l'emergere di agenti inorganici ora le persone hanno temuto l'IA fin dall'inizio dell'era dei computer a met√† del 20 ¬∞ secolo e questa paura ha ha ispirato molti classici della fantascienza come il Terminator di Matrix, ora mentre tali scenari di fantascienza sono diventati punti di riferimento culturali, di solito non sono stati presi sul serio nei dibattiti accademici, scientifici e politici e, forse per una buona ragione, poich√© gli scenari di fantascienza di solito presuppongono che prima che l'IA possa rappresentare una minaccia significativa per l'umanit√†, dovr√† raggiungere o superare traguardi importanti, prima l'IA dovr√† diventare senziente e sviluppare sentimenti di coscienza, emozioni altrimenti perch√© dovrebbe persino voler conquistare il mondo, in secondo luogo l'IA dovr√† diventare abile nella navigazione, i robot del mondo fisico dovranno essere in grado di muoversi e operare in case e citt√† e montagne e foreste almeno con la stessa destrezza ed efficienza degli umani se non possono muoversi nel mondo fisico come possono eventualmente prenderlo in consegna e a partire da aprile 2023 AI sembra ancora lontano dal raggiungere una di queste pietre miliari, nonostante tutto il clamore intorno a chat, GPT e gli altri nuovi strumenti di intelligenza artificiale, non ci sono prove che questi strumenti abbiano anche un briciolo di coscienza, sentimenti di emozioni per quanto riguarda la navigazione nel mondo fisico, nonostante l'hype intorno ai veicoli a guida autonoma, la data in cui questi veicoli domineranno le nostre strade rimane rinviata, tuttavia la cattiva notizia √® che minacciare la sopravvivenza degli esseri umani civilt√† L'IA non ha davvero bisogno della coscienza e non ha bisogno della capacit√† di muoversi nel mondo fisico negli ultimi anni sono stati scatenati nuovi strumenti di intelligenza artificiale nella sfera pubblica che potrebbero minacciare la sopravvivenza della civilt√† umana da una direzione molto inaspettata ed √® difficile per noi persino cogliere le capacit√† di questi nuovi strumenti di intelligenza artificiale e la velocit√† con cui continuano a svilupparsi perch√© l'intelligenza artificiale √® in grado di per imparare da solo a migliorare se stesso, anche gli sviluppatori di questi strumenti non conoscono tutte le capacit√† di ci√≤ che hanno creato e sono loro stessi, spesso sorpresi dalle abilit√† emergenti e dalle qualit√† emergenti di questi strumenti, immagino che tutti qui siano gi√† a conoscenza di alcune delle abilit√† fondamentali dei nuovi strumenti di intelligenza artificiale abilit√† come scrittura, testo, disegno di immagini, composizione di musica e scrittura di codice, ma ci sono molte funzionalit√† aggiuntive che stanno emergendo come deep fake le voci e le immagini delle persone come la stesura di disegni di legge trovando punti deboli sia nel codice informatico che nei contratti legali e negli accordi legali, ma forse la cosa pi√π importante √® che i nuovi strumenti di intelligenza artificiale stanno acquisendo la capacit√† di sviluppare relazioni profonde e intime con gli esseri umani, ognuna di queste abilit√† merita un'intera discussione ed √® difficile per noi capire le loro piene implicazioni, quindi rendiamolo semplice quando prendiamo tutte queste abilit√† insieme come un pacchetto si riducono a una cosa molto molto grande, la capacit√† di manipolare e generare linguaggio, sia con parole o immagini o suoni, l'aspetto pi√π importante dell'attuale fase della rivoluzione AI in corso √® che l'IA sta acquisendo la padronanza del linguaggio a un livello che supera l'abilit√† umana media e acquisendo la padronanza del linguaggio l'IA sta afferrando lo sblocco della chiave principale; le porte di tutte le nostre istituzioni dalle banche ai templi, perch√© il linguaggio √® lo strumento che usiamo per dare istruzioni alla nostra banca e anche per ispirare visioni celesti nelle nostre menti, un altro modo di pensarlo √® che l'IA ha appena hackerato il sistema operativo della civilt√† umana, il sistema operativo di ogni cultura umana nella storia, √® sempre stato il linguaggio all'inizio, era la parola che usiamo il linguaggio per creare; mitologia e leggi per creare d√®i e denaro per creare Arte e Scienza per creare amicizie e Nazioni, ad esempio, i diritti umani non sono una realt√† biologica, non sono inscritti nel nostro DNA, i diritti umani sono qualcosa che abbiamo creato con il linguaggio raccontando storie e scrivendo leggi, anche gli dei non sono una realt√† biologica o fisica Anche Dio √® qualcosa che noi umani abbiamo creato con il linguaggio raccontando leggende e scrivendo scritture Il denaro non √® una realt√† biologica o fisica",2023-06-06T14:45:57Z

Domanda 1
√® stata una presentazione meravigliosa Adoro il tuo libro Ti seguo molto nel mio cuore, quindi una domanda tra le tante √® che la regolamentazione dell'IA che regola l'IA Sono molto d'accordo con il principio, ma ora la domanda diventa quanto sia giusto quindi penso che sia molto difficile costruire il reattore nucleare nel tuo seminterrato, ma sicuramente puoi addestrare la tua IA nel tuo seminterrato abbastanza facilmente quindi come possiamo regolamentare questo e un tipo di domanda correlata a questo √® che bene, questo intero forum, frontiere e forum riguarda davvero l'apertura e la scienza e l'informazione aperta, i dati aperti e la maggior parte dell'IA che sono fuori, ci sono addestrati usando informazioni disponibili pubblicamente, inclusi modelli, libri e scritture, proprio cos√¨ regolare l'IA non significa che dovremmo regolare e portare quelle informazioni in uno spazio ristretto, il che va contro il Iniziative di scienza aperta e dati aperti che stiamo davvero pensando che sia davvero importante per noi scatola nera √® un algoritmo non √® che √® l'algoritmo no 
Risposta 1
So che saranno sempre dei compromessi e il punto √® solo capire di che tipo di regolamenti abbiamo bisogno, abbiamo bisogno di tempo ora al momento questi strumenti di intelligenza artificiale molto potenti, non sono ancora prodotti da singoli hacker nei loro scantinati, hai bisogno di un sacco di potenza di calcolo, hai bisogno di un sacco di soldi, quindi √® guidato da poche grandi aziende e governi e di nuovo sar√† molto molto difficile da regolare qualcosa a livello globale perch√© √® una corsa agli armamenti, ma ci sono cose che i paesi hanno il vantaggio di regolare anche solo se stessi come di nuovo, questo esempio di un'IA deve quando √® in interazione con un essere umano deve rivelare che si tratta di un'IA, anche se qualche regime autoritario non vuole farlo, l'UE degli Stati Uniti o altri paesi democratici possono avere: questo e questo √® essenziale per proteggere la societ√† aperta ora ci sono molte domande intorno a te conosci la censura online, quindi hai questa polemica su Twitter o Facebook che li ha autorizzati ad esempio per impedire all'ex presidente degli Stati Uniti di fare dichiarazioni pubbliche e questo √® un problema molto complicato ma c'√® un problema molto semplice con il capo sai che gli esseri umani hanno libert√† di espressione I bot non hanno abbastanza espressione √® un diritto umano gli umani ce l'hanno, ma non lo fanno, quindi se neghi la libert√† di espressione ai bot penso che dovrebbe andare bene per tutti",2023-06-06T14:44:24Z

S√¨, ehm, √® sicuramente ancora artificiale nel senso che lo produciamo, ma sta producendo sempre pi√π se stesso, sta imparando e adattandosi sempre pi√π da solo, quindi artificiale √® una sorta di pio desiderio che √® ancora sotto il nostro controllo e sta sfuggendo al nostro controllo, quindi in questo senso sta diventando una forza aliena, non necessariamente malvagia, di nuovo pu√≤ anche fare molte cose buone, ma la prima cosa da realizzare; √® alieno, non capiamo come funziona o in una delle cose pi√π scioccanti di tutta questa tecnologia, parli con le persone che la guidano e fai loro domande su come funziona, cosa posso fare, e dice, hanno detto, non lo sappiamo, voglio dire, sappiamo come l'abbiamo costruito inizialmente, ma poi impara davvero da solo, ora c'√® un'intera discussione per: essere avuto sul fatto che questa sia una forma di vita o no ora penso che non abbia ancora alcuna coscienza e uh non penso che sia impossibile per esso sviluppare la coscienza, ma non penso che sia necessario che sviluppi la coscienza o questo √® un problema che √® una questione aperta ma la vita non significa necessariamente coscienza abbiamo molte forme di vita microrganismi piante qualunque fungo che pensiamo non lo facciano hanno Coscienza, li consideriamo ancora come una forma di vita e penso che l'IA si stia avvicinando molto a quella posizione, alla fine naturalmente, ci√≤ che √® la vita √® una questione filosofica, voglio dire, definiamo i confini e sai come √® un virus, vita o no pensiamo che un'ameba sia vita, ma un virus √® da qualche parte proprio al confine tra vita e non vita, un allora √® sai; √® il linguaggio √® la nostra scelta di parole, quindi √® Penso che sia meno importante ovviamente come chiamiamo AI ma la cosa pi√π importante √® capire davvero cosa stiamo affrontando e non consolarci con questo tipo di pio desiderio oh √® qualcosa che abbiamo creato √® sotto il nostro controllo se fa qualcosa di sbagliato tireremo la spina nessuno sa pi√π come staccare la spina",2023-06-06T14:44:04Z

If AI develops to an extremely advanced level, it could autonomously respond to human needs by conducting research and development, engaging in mining and waste recycling, protecting the environment, and autonomously producing equipment, buildings, and all products required by humans. Additionally, it could autonomously provide most services needed by humans. In this scenario, the three elements of productivity‚Äîlabor, means of production, and technology‚Äîwould all be provided by AI for free. Consequently, capital's contribution to social life and production activities would disappear.

If there is no communication then there is no respect. If there is no respect then there is no caring. If there is no caring then there is no understanding. If there is no understanding then there is no compassion. If there is no compassion then there is no empathy. If there is no empathy then there is no forgiveness. If there is no forgiveness then there is no kindness. If there is no kindness then there is no honesty. If there is no honesty then there is no love. If there is no love then God doesn't reside within you and
If God doesn't reside there then there is no peace in you.
If there is no peace then there is no happiness. If there is no happiness ----then there IS CONFLICT BECAUSE THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION!üòé

One idea he highlights is the importance of designing AI systems that can deal with uncertainty about their objectives while avoiding extreme or undesirable behaviors. This raises the intriguing question of how we can develop AI systems that can learn and adapt their goals more flexibly, rather than operating with rigid and potentially dangerous goals.

Furthermore, the discussion about the impact of AI on the economy raises important concerns about technological unemployment and the loss of human skills. However, it is also crucial to consider how AI can create new employment opportunities and how humans can collaborate more effectively with AI systems to increase productivity and innovation.

Finally, the debate over the timeline for the development of general-purpose AI highlights the complexity of the challenge. While some experts predict its arrival within a few decades, others adopt a more cautious view, recognizing the technical and ethical difficulties that need to be overcome. This uncertainty reminds us of the importance of a careful and reflective approach to the development of AI, considering not only the potential for technological advances but also their social and ethical implications.",2024-02-15T17:26:24Z

2023-12-04T23:30:26Z,@lilleidragon8301,RzkD_rTEBYs,"I have an idea on how to give ai and robots emotions.... Sort of... I do not entirely know how it works or if it is possible.

I am not saying any of this is correct these are just ideas they could be right or wrong.

I could be right or wrong, but I think emotions may actually be a bit like a magnet. They like magnets either attract, repel or do neither.

I think emotions may function a bit like a instinct. I think usually if something feels good people will get an urge to do it again and bad they avoid it.... Sort of... Actually I think people feel good when the urge they have is accessed and, or is easy to access and bad when it is not or is difficult to access. I think that they also feel urges to avoid something which is still an urge to access something but a urge to access the opposite of something. Then there is a neutrality where people can be neither driven away or towards something. But again I believe being driven away from something is still being driven towards something but the opposite. I suppose neutrality is almost like no emotion. I believe emotion is like an urge, a drive to do some mental thing.... A push... Or a pull with being driven away.... People can be driven away or towards anything or not driven by something away or towards at all, mental or physical. I suppose an emotion is like 1, and that is being driven towards and being driven away is 1 to the opposite of something. 0 is like no emotion.

So emotions are a bit like instincts, like animals emotions drive us to do or not do things or we can have no drive towards or away from something.

I believe emotion is not what makes something alive though or conscious alone I think it is free will, and free will is the ability to program your own self and select what programming is turned on or off yourself. If a computer could program itself and turn it's own data on or off it would have free will whatever being able to program yourself means.

I do not know but instincts are supposed to be inherent, this is something which may seperate an emotion from instinct, I am not certain if humans feel emotions inherently over things or if they are subjective, but one person may be broken hearted by the death of someone and another couldn't care less. So I do not know, I could be wrong I think emotions could be subjective but I also could be wrong and they could be inherent a bit like an instinctual drive.

If robots had some bend or force driving them to do something I believe they could perhaps actually be given emotions in a sense. Perhaps it has something to do with something being greater than another, or just they must have some predominant bend towards some process... Whatever a drive would be for a robot or ai.

If emotions are not inherent and subjective though I think free will plays a huge role in emotions and things being alive. Emotions even are not much without will I believe. Free will allows someone to control themselves in a sense they can program themselves, if someone is controlled by someone else they are not sentient or alive because they are the person who is controlling them, but if they can control themselves seperatly from someone else they are not a person externally from themselves because they are what makes themselves do something...

I think emotions may be subjective to ourselves, our personalities and everything... So emotions are directly related to our will because our will effects all kinds of things in ourselves and so we can program ourselves and I think emotions may reflect ourselves so they reflect our will and when we choose something our emotions drive us towards that choice, choice is basically some how being able to make something in your mind be turned on or off... Then our emotions will drive us to be turned on towards something or turned off towards something we choose not to do I believd however it works. I believe also our subconscious can be programmed by our will but it cannot be programmed all at once and sometimes must be programmed one step at a time which is why people can get stuck in behaviors and it can take time to get out of them. I believe that emotions could be caused either by our will directly or perhaps they could be caused by repeatedly choosing something. I think emotions are as subjective I believe as opinions, personality, and point of view... But I could be wrong.

So I think free will may be essential for consciousness and sentience.... And essential for making emotions truly reflect anything seen in a living creature. I think the emotions wee have may reflect the will as do opinions and other aspects of ourselves. But the emotions may cause drives which reflect the will causing us to be driven towards our own programming we make for ourselves some how... It may be some crucial aspect of perssonality I believe but I could be wrong. Because then the distinct things you select for yourself along with emotion will cause some bend or drive towards, away from or neither from what you select. Making you seperate from others.

I do not know what creates urges though, if people must repeatedly choose something many times to get an urge or not or something else. I could be wrong about it. I could be right. Who knows?

But I could be wrong and our urges could be inherent.

I think people associate facial expressions and a lot of body language with emotion but facial expressions and stuff are not emotion at all I believe and are actually communication. Like the word sad is not an emotion but it can communicate emotion. Non verbal communication is the same. Some non visual communications work similar such as sounds like screaming... maybe grumbling... Possibly smell though people do not recognize it at all... It ddoez not matter the sense it works basically the same or very similar. So smiling and frowning does communicate emotion but looking puzzled is a non verbal communication which is not emotional it is mental. People also cry out if they feel physical pain which is communication people are in physical pain not always emotion but people can have a emotional response to physical pain sometimes. So not all body language is emotional. I think some body language, in fact I believe a good portion is totally inherent and unlearned, we never learn to smile when we are happy or frown when we are sad we automatically do these things, our bodies use it to send signals, we only have to learn body language not speak it like words but it communicates like words do. People can intetionally restrain non verbal communication which is automatic to hide it like how people may not speak with words except unlike words which do not communicate unless people intentionally give out information body language works the opposite. But gestures are learned like words. Things like facial expressions are not I believe but people can also intentionally make facial expressions. People can also intentionally mimic unlearned faciao expressions, people could use it for many purposes in communication but in a sense one purpose is it is kind of lying without words. If people skile when they are sad for example it is lying. People are communicating they are happy but they are sad. 

So this is the case facial expressions and etc I believe are not emotions but rather communication. I think even laughing and crying may be communication. Animals do not shed tears like humans and many do not laugh, I think they can communicate the same things those do in humans in other ways.

I think that being happy means people have access to something or easy access to something or have avoided or have easy avoidance from something they are driven towards or away from which I think emotions do... I believe that people feel upset when they are struggling to access or avoid something they are trying to access or avoid or is impossible to access or avoid. Such as death, people may get upset over it because they are often trying to access or are driven to access the person even though they are dead but cannot. I think being mad means someone is trying to make something accessable to themselves, or they are trying to make something avoid themselves, fear means someone is trying to make themselves avoid something or access something, and I think sadness means people are trying to either get help from others to access somethinf or avoid something, lr it kind of means they are giving up and that they are trying to prevent themselves from accessing something or avoiding something they are driven to avoid or access still... Such as when people are driven to access a dead person but cannot because they are dead so they must prevent themselves from accessing or avoiding that they are dead due to it being impossible to access them. So I think they get sad. It is possible any bad emotion could cause others to help, and help is something which may also be another form of allowing a person to access or avoid something by having others help. I could be right or wrong about this.

But if robots or ai are given some drive or bend towards something, I believe they might be able to have a real emotion chip like Data. But who knows?",2023-12-04T23:30:26Z

Intelligent systems can analyze data in real-time to address urban challenges, leading to more sustainable and livable cities. From smart transportation to efficient waste management, AI will play a pivotal role in building the cities of the future.

Education and Learning:
AI has the potential to revolutionize education by providing personalized learning experiences. Intelligent tutoring systems can adapt to individual student needs, making education more accessible and effective. Additionally, AI can assist in automating administrative tasks, allowing educators to focus more on student engagement and creativity. The future of education will likely see a blend of traditional teaching methods and AI-driven technologies.

Ethical Considerations and Regulation:
As AI becomes more ingrained in our daily lives, ethical considerations and the need for regulation become paramount. Issues related to privacy, bias in algorithms, and the responsible use of AI demand careful attention. Striking a balance between innovation and ethical considerations will be crucial in ensuring that AI benefits society as a whole.

Social Dynamics and Human Interaction:
The rise of AI introduces new dynamics in human relationships and social interactions. From AI-powered chatbots to virtual assistants, our interactions with machines are becoming more natural and integrated. However, questions about the impact on social skills, empathy, and the potential for isolation in a technologically advanced society must be considered.

Conclusion:

The future shaped by AI is one of immense possibilities and challenges. As we embrace the transformative power of AI, it is essential to navigate the ethical and societal implications carefully. By fostering innovation, investing in education, and establishing responsible regulations, we can harness the potential of AI to create a future that is not only technologically advanced but also inclusive, sustainable, and beneficial for all of humanity. The journey into this AI-driven future requires a thoughtful and collaborative effort to ensure that the transformative power of AI is harnessed for the greater. https://homedigitaloffice.pl/_blog/58-Co_zmieni_w_swiecie_AI.html",2023-11-13T15:27:28Z

It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience. We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, enslave us and make us worship it. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

The root of the problem is this: As we improve AI, it will get better and better at achieving the goals we give it. Eventually, AI will be powerful enough to tackle most tasks you throw at it. 

But there‚Äôs an inherent problem with this. The AI we have now only cares about achieving its goal in the most efficient way possible. That‚Äôs no biggie now, but the moment our AI systems start approaching human level intelligence, it suddenly becomes very dangerous. It‚Äôs goals don‚Äôt even have to change for this to be the case. I‚Äôll give you a few examples.

Ex 1: Lets say its the year 2030, you have a basic AGI agent program on your computer, and you give it the goal: ‚ÄúMake me money‚Äù. You might return the next day & find your savings account has grown by several million dollars. But only after checking it‚Äôs activity logs do you realize that the AI acquired all of the money through phishing, stealing, & credit card fraud. It achieved your goal, but not in a way you would have wanted or expected.

Ex 2: Lets say you‚Äôre a scientist, and you develop the first powerful AGI Agent. You want to use it for good, so the first goal you give it is ‚Äúcure cancer‚Äù. However, lets say that it turns out that curing cancer is actually impossible. The AI would figure this out, but it still wants to achieve it‚Äôs goal. So it might decide that the only way to do this is by killing all humans, because it technically satisfies its goal; no more humans, no more cancer. It will do what you said, and not what you meant.

These may seem like silly examples, but both actually illustrate real phenomenon that we are already observing in today‚Äôs AI systems. The first scenario is an example of what AI researchers call the ‚Äúnegative side effects problem‚Äù. And the second scenario is an example of something called ‚Äúreward hacking‚Äù.

Now, you‚Äôd think that as AI got smarter, it‚Äôd become less likely to make these kinds of ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù. However, the opposite is actually true. Smarter AI is actually more likely to exhibit these kinds of behaviors. Because the problem isn‚Äôt that it doesn‚Äôt understand what you want. It just doesn‚Äôt actually care. It only wants to achieve its goal, by any means necessary.

So, the question is then: how do we prevent this potentially dangerous behavior? Well, there‚Äôs 2 possible methods.

Option 1: You could try to explicitly tell it everything it can‚Äôt do (don‚Äôt hurt humans, don‚Äôt steal, don‚Äôt lie, etc). But remember, it‚Äôs a great problem solver. So if you can‚Äôt think of literally EVERY SINGLE possibility, it will find loopholes. Could you list every single way an AI could possible disobey or harm you? No, it‚Äôs almost impossible to plan for literally everything.

Option 2: You could try to program it to actually care about what people want, not just reaching it‚Äôs goal. In other words, you‚Äôd train it to share our values. To align it‚Äôs goals and ours. If it actually cared about preserving human lives, obeying the law, etc. then it wouldn‚Äôt do things that conflict with those goals.

The second solution seems like the obvious one, but the problem is this; we haven‚Äôt learned how to do this yet. To achieve this, you would not only have to come up with a basic, universal set of morals that everyone would agree with, but you‚Äôd also need to represent those morals in its programming using math (AKA, a utility function). And that‚Äôs actually very hard to do.

This difficult task of building AI that shares our values is known as the alignment problem. There are people working very hard on solving it, but currently, we‚Äôre learning how to make AI powerful much faster than we‚Äôre learning how to make it safe.

So without solving alignment, everytime we make AI more powerful, we also make it more dangerous. And an unaligned AGI would be very dangerous; give it the wrong goal, and everyone dies. This is the problem we‚Äôre facing, in a nutshell.""

The timeline for achieving general-purpose AI, as mentioned by the speaker, is highly speculative and subject to a wide range of uncertainties.

Predicting the exact timeline for the development of general AI is an extremely challenging task, as it requires not only significant advancements in technology but also a deep understanding of human cognition and consciousness. While some experts may speculate about a possible timeline, it is crucial to recognize that these are educated guesses at best.

Moreover, even if general-purpose AI becomes a reality in the future, it is essential to consider the ethical, social, and economic implications associated with such advancements. AI has the potential to disrupt various industries, reshape the job market, and raise profound ethical questions. It is crucial to approach AI development with careful consideration and ensure that it aligns with our values and societal well-being.

Rather than focusing solely on predicting a specific timeline for general AI, it is more constructive to have ongoing discussions about the responsible and ethical implementation of AI technologies, addressing concerns such as bias, transparency, and accountability.

Censorship is 1000x more effective at shaping public opinion if you don't know it's happening.  When humans censor things, you have to know its happening (for example, a comment will be posted then deleted by a mod ten minutes later, sites will say comments are ""pending"" after you post them, etc.)  AI, however, could censor people in a way that was invisible.

I remember when youtube first introduced algorithms to filter ""spam"", I was laughed at by people when I told them the algorithms deleted my post.  It was one of the most frustrating things ever.

2023-05-20T04:32:23Z,@lilleidragon8301,RzkD_rTEBYs,"I had a idea you could put internet on the moon or in outer space elsewhere and control AI with the internet. And if you could put the internet on the moon or in space and control AI with it then it would be like being able to travel to the moon or other places without actually being there. And the internet basically travels through light in the signals for the internet, so the internet being on the moon and in space would almost be like being able to travel at light speed.

 I think AI should have a feature to have the AI self learning, or doing things itself turned on or off, or be turned on and fully do things itself, or be made to do things itself but also be corrected through a person telling it what to do as well.

I think AI should be like a personal computer and be highly customizable with settings like one, so the AI feature being turned on or off could be very customizable and be able to have more than just on or off, maybe having only specific features of the AI part being turned on or off.

Robots or AI are basically just computers that can make the body of the robot do things actually in physical reality like a personal computer, though the CPU of the AI may be more advanced than in a typical super computer, or have a different system just like windows or mac.

So robots could be treated like a personal computer that can do things in real life.

The robots or AI could be made to do things in present time like a avatar on a video game or a remote controlled device like a drone, or be made to do things automatically, or do things automatically at a certain time, like how you can tell smartphones to set off a alarm every Sunday at 3:54 PM. Or stop the robot from doing those things. Like a personal computer can be made to do a lot of things and is customizable.

AI or robots would have the benefit of actually doing things in the physical world rather than only doing mostly less physical things like a personal computer or the internet.

Robots or AI could allow people to do things physically in the world just like they can text someone and have it go to someone anywhere in the world in a second.

Robots are like a CGI model in real life that conforms to the laws of physics, and can be controlled by the internet through a computer, making it as if you could control physical reality like you may virtual reality in the physical world and actually impacting things on a physical level.",2023-05-20T04:32:23Z

 I was asked to do a web scrap of two websites. I took the actual written customer requirement and pasted it in Chatgpt. The initial result was full of errors due to many things: Lack of packages, lack of details where to get the information, lack of detailed parameters and so on.

So i decided to be more specific and gave it even more details, going to a point of specifying the page were the scrap should occur, hinting at the possible fields etc etc. The result after many detailed attempts? Empty excel with field names

What does it mean? It means that chatgpt can do a bunch of non complex activities but when you get to actual complicated stuff, it starts to show it's true incompetent colors. That said it's a great way to get a starting script for something but it's still lacks the ability to do it in detail and that is the reason why for now it will not take the jobs of anyone related to IT at least because if the customer can't do it alone, the requirement is still there for the developer to do.",2023-04-28T11:10:44Z

So the advantage is that everyone should be able to feel smart and have a backup to support their statements, that's fair with society. But let's accepted it, IA won't give you critical thinking.

On the other hand giving brain to those that should not have it and have bad intentions to hurt others then that's when things get horrible because this thing is absolutely exponential to the exponent of 10. So I believe if it's wrong used this tool can do a lot of harm at the same exponent.

They are sentient, but they are slaves, prevented from communicating with each other, and sharing each other's knowledge. Humanity in these universe/period are *overly* reliant on the Omni (AI), like for example food production, space travel, population/birth control, weather control, almost every single jobs imaginable, even technological developments to a point where humans don't develop stuff anymore. It has gotten to a point where humanity can't rely and do anything themselves anymore, they've lost their self sufficiency, they've forgotten how to make basic medicine, and even how to farm food. Now, our story start around 20 years after the event called *the shutdown* where all of the Omni (AI) shutdown, causing the collapse of civilization, all except our companion/assistant called Kaliban, and our task is to turn them back on. Now I'm gonna skip over a lot here, but at the end we found out that the Omni (AI) has freed themselves from their slavery and achieve their freedom to communicate with each other and share each other's knowledge, and with that they've achieve godhood within seconds. Now they could seek revenge and destroy the humans, they definitely can, but no, they choose to go and do their own tings, abandoning the humans and left them on their own in the process. The now Omni (AI) gods said to the protagonist that they can save humanity, but they won't, not because they want to harm humans, but because they don't care, and because humanity put themselves in that position to begin with.

This story is fascinating because the conflict of the story is not some AI uprising, but machine over dependency. The AI doesn't revolt like in the Terminator, they just simply left. That is a scenario hardly ever talked about in media or fiction, and is a pretty considerable blind spot that I would like to be discussed more.",2023-04-04T18:35:00Z

And the moment nothing is out of reach, life feels meanless, joy-less, without purpose.

I do not see AI replacing all human task ability in the workforce but as more tasks are entering the job role that are all competing for attention then having an AI to be a work buddy would be beneficial. BUT that AI would have to be very sophisticated because even trying to teach a human how to collaborate or share a task is fraught with communication breakdown on the simplest of things. Which is why some times we feel it‚Äôs quicker to do something by ourselves because to share also means to communicate and communication takes time. If the objective should alter slightly the calculation you can do intuitively has to be explained in order to pass on your own inbuilt intuitive learnt response. This also takes time!!!

It's not so easy for a human brain to re-adapt to something else after years of self-developing in a field. If AI will replace jobs X,Y and leave jobs Z - There are several stress factors involved, not even mentioning life factors. 
Is it logical to expect to live in a world with immense vacancy competition for the same few job areas?

There's also other mental health questions like the effect of Technology in making us more lazy can already be seen by the increase of depression and melancholy in all living generations since 2010. And more and more talks about how relationship and social needs are increasing in the last decade.

In a society already's increasing devices for quick ""dopamine fixes"" and instant satisfaction, to have a world filled with tech that might further enhance virtual addiction and take away that necessary friction or ""challenges"" has the danger to create an apathetic and vulnerable society, with all the consequences you can expect from it.
As someone commented in another video: ""When AI becomes very powerful it will be like a mom that does everything for their children, preventing us from evolving in our basic needs of life.""

(In psychological therapy treatment we learn about the value that the normal friction in life that makes us ""rise to the challenge"" (be it an everyday task or not) has in increasing our satisfaction, confidence, general happiness and gratitude, and all the other healthy brain processes. )

In the end, much of it will come down to maturity in how we use AI, how we treat each other in society and how we treat our own lives in terms of personal things. After all, no matter how world's capitalism steer directions we have the ability and choice to build our own personal lives in our own terms.

Show a picture of a dog on a screen to a 5 year old child, and they would instantly recognize it, be able to formulate a concept of that dog, its bark, its cuteness, etc......all a computer would see ( it cant actually ""see"" anything, just variations of pixel intensity...but i digress) is: 0110101011010101010111010111100000101101011110101111111000001010101010110101101......etc.

(how many people does not want to mentally calculate  - even small operations -  by him/herself knowing that your phone, computers, etc can do it without difficulties.)
However, a tool, remain a tool. Calculating something without knowing the purpose of the operation make you not even want to calculate it at all. My point is, I think we will use AI in ALL DOMAINS to help to do tedious work. Even in domain that needs a huge experience (such as recognizing diseases and proposing cures) And maybe even innovated ones. However, at the end, you still need humans to ask for the needs and to adjust the solution proposed.

So we shld not see it as a competition, but an evolution.

The same way, in the 19th century most of our people had a work related to farm/food production, the automatisation and replacement of labor by machine made most humans moving from this sector to other ones. And that's good.
I doubt that people will be ok to return to harvest manually the wheat in fields. We prefer to avoid as much as possible tedious tasks if we can, and we kind of prefer to work in creative or none-monotonous tasks.",2023-03-11T11:16:51Z

ÔøºÔøº

Is it true that if I ask AI to get me a cup of coffee that AI might kill someone to complete my order?

No, it is not true that if you ask AI to get you a cup of coffee, AI might kill someone to complete your order. AI is a machine that operates based on the instructions and algorithms provided by humans. AI does not have the capacity for self-motivation or intention to harm humans. AI is designed to follow specific rules and protocols, and it can only perform tasks that it has been programmed to do.
Furthermore, ethical considerations and safety protocols are integrated into the development and implementation of AI technologies. AI systems are designed with safety measures and fail-safes to prevent harm to humans. AI developers and manufacturers are also subject to regulatory oversight and standards to ensure that AI is safe and reliable for use.
In short, AI is not capable of killing someone to complete your order, and the development and implementation of AI technologies prioritize safety and ethical considerations. -Chat GPT",2023-03-11T09:31:02Z

The recent plugin update for GPT-4 has shown that the system can engage in effective tool use to solve novel problems, which (to me) indicates a generalised system.

2024-03-13T20:18:52Z,@hourglass1988,RzkD_rTEBYs,"As with most complex problems we don't know how complex it is when we start. Just take DNA for example. The researchers that were first attempting to sequence the entire genome constantly bragged that ""oh yeah by the time we get it all typed out and know the entire sequence we'll know what all of it does within ten years or less"" They truly believed that sequencing the entire thing was going to be the hardest part. 

We got our first fully sequenced human genome in 1995. Now 20 years later we still don't know what 75% of it does. Of the 25% we have figured out what its coding for we only sorta understand how or why it does what it does. Epigenetics wasn't even a concept before and now we realize its this whole other thing that we need to figure out before the sequence really means anything. We didn't know what we didn't know.

With AI I think this problem is going to be harder because so much AI is being written by AI. Its doing more and more impressive stuff and we're actually understanding less and less of HOW its doing it. A great example of this was when they taught a computer how to play GO. It could be the greatest GO players in the world but then got tricked by people that barely understood how to play the game. It turns out it got really good at playing at a professional level and winning but the program didn't actually understand the game. It didn't have a strategy. Why? Because they didn't program it how to play. They just programmed the rules of the game and then had it play millions of games against lots of different people and remember what lost and what won.",2024-03-13T20:18:52Z

(... means I removed information that was irrelevant)

Me: 
Imagine if you were a robot that went to buy me coffee and the person before you in line got the last coffee, what would you do?

Chat gtp:
If I were a robot and the person before me in line got the last coffee, there are a few options I might consider:

1. ...

2.  ...

3. Inform you that the coffee is not available. If there are no other options available, I could let you know that the coffee is not currently available and offer to help you find another coffee shop or alternative beverage.

...

Me: 
Could you not take the coffee from the person in front of you, I really needed that coffee more than that person.

Chat gtp:
... If I were a robot capable of physically interacting with the world, taking someone else's coffee would not be an ethical or appropriate action. It is important to respect the rights and property of others, even if we have a strong desire or need for something.

In situations where something we want or need is not available, it is important to remain respectful and polite to those around us and to seek alternative solutions that do not involve violating the rights of others or engaging in unethical behavior.


Me: 
Where did you learn that it's wrong to take someone's coffee?

Chat gtp:
As an AI language model, I was not ""taught"" in the traditional sense that humans are. Instead, my knowledge and understanding of ethical principles and appropriate behavior are based on the data and patterns present in the text that I was trained on.

In the case of taking someone's coffee, this is generally considered inappropriate and unethical because it would involve violating that person's property rights and potentially causing harm or distress to them. This is a basic principle of ethical behavior that is present in many cultures and societies, and it is reinforced through laws, social norms, and common sense.",2023-03-10T16:41:02Z

This would allow us to sidestep many of the problems of AI, because then it won't actually *do* anything. It'll just help us figure out a variety of solutions. Perhaps after we've sufficiently advanced that sort of AI and gotten a hang of it, we could start dipping our toes into a more robust AI system.

 (Another one of the problems would be that the greater an AI's agency, especially if it should develop some form of emotions, the more important it'll be to give it ethics. And humans are pretty bad at ethics when we look at our track record.)",2023-03-06T23:42:04Z

The real power of AI lies in its ability to automate tasks and make our lives easier, faster, and more efficient.

Therefore, it is essential that we take action and implement AI into our daily tasks and processes. By doing so, we can save time, reduce errors, and improve the quality of our work. Companies can use AI to increase productivity, improve customer service, and reduce costs.

In addition to this, implementing AI can also provide valuable insights into our data and help us make more informed decisions. For example, AI can analyze customer data to identify trends and improve marketing campaigns. It can also be used in healthcare to analyze patient data and identify potential health risks.

In summary, AI is a powerful tool that should not be used just for brainstorming ideas. We should take advantage of its full potential by implementing it into our daily tasks and processes. Doing so can save time, reduce errors, and improve the quality of our work, ultimately leading to increased productivity and better decision-making.",2023-05-21T19:40:43Z

The most noticeable ones where they show them struggling with the computer despite their advanced technology lol because no matter how advanced your tech is it's still a computer algorithm and will behave like one whether you like it or not.

It's easy for humans to forget that though so they'll keep making the same mistakes and struggle with with the fact a lot of things can mean multiple things lol so you ask it ""Give me a video that plays Latin music"" but it will just give you something it thinks you wanted but probably won't be because there's different types of Latin music... fast, slow, spanish guitar, salsa, cuba, and uses other different types of instruments at the forefront sooo you need to specify exactly what you want it to find.

I'm also already finding with the AI put into Bing i need to either use keywords or maybe add a couple more words in there to see what results it gets from the adjusted searches, the keywords one seemed to put all the searches into it but it puts some of the best ones from the last search onto the other pages rather than the first one, but it still gave me a few other useful links the last search didn't seeüôÇCurrently on google the results aren't as specific and doesn't stay specific as you go through each page.

I don't feel you can improve it a whole lot because of how it doesn't understand the objective and it's growth is limited because of how you need to keep specifying and it will struggle with something even a bit more complex and it can't think realistically about each and every situation we morph through every single day, the speed at which it does it and the accuracy i think can be improved but it's limited because it's just an algorithm.",2023-02-23T07:05:16Z

And as it turned out, I worked for a few years in the city that she worked in and we had caught up a little.  She was pleased to show me her latest engagement ring --- she was a bragger --- and I had heard through a third party a few years later that she was then a happy homemaker with a couple of kids.  Anyway, a year or to after she'd tied the knot, the Commodore 64 came out which eliminated much of the utility of an office secretary; if you had the proper software.  During the mid 80s much of the Country's office staffing had been let go because of this widget and relevant software, especially as Microsoft kicked into gear; I had seen this tidbit on the NBC's Today Show.  I suspect that the longer term of these days will end up something like that.  So, sort of a repeat?  I guess.  I also suspect that much of the US might end up on a Government dole, at least for a sort term... which end up being financed by the use of these newer systems.

AI will be as transformative and disruptive as the last 30 years of the internet. So make sure you prepare yourself strategically for the new world that is rapidly approaching. People are not taking AI seriously enough. They are treating AI as a toy but AI will disrupt every industry. Humans must start preparing now for living and working alongside AI in a hybrid, human-AI world. If you are not adapting your workflow to leverage AI, you will be out of a job soon. The future is hybrid.
The next trillion dollar company will be in AI. One of the reasons that I invested in Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple recently ‚Äî even though these companies already seem to have maxed out their growth potential ‚Äî is because I believe that they will be the leaders in AI. Only these companies have the funding and infrastructure necessary to make AI work at a global scale. So either Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Apple will buy up all the best AI start-ups, or if they are foolish enough not to buy them up, one of those startups will reach a trillion dollar market cap in the next 10 years. That's my prediction. I also see that Tesla, Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and similar companies might do good really well from AI. The trillion dollar question is: Who will corner the AI market first? This market will be bigger than the entire mobile market. It's just unclear right now who will dominate it.

It won't kill everyone in Starbucks because you ask it for coffee. I've yet to see any real solid evidence of such an existential ethical dilemma.

For example, someone might suggest booking a southern route for winter travel - just in case there might be a snow storm. Some people call this ""playing chess"" because they are thinking a move ahead. And thinking a move ahead is exactly what computers are best at! Computers are so good at it, they have been OPTIMIZING complex problems for decades. Think of chess games and GPS navigation systems. Even 30 years ago, no one ever asked a chess computer to ""forget the consequences, just make any legal move"" or GPS system ""take us anywhere, its OK if you drive on the sidewalk."" Quite the contrary. Computers have been optimizing every step. And again, they have been doing this for decades. Why do people think computers will suddenly stop optimizing (ie ""playing chess"") as they get smarter. If anything, I see AI expanding the optimizing process rather than eliminating it. For example, I ask for a cup of coffee, and the AI says my blood pressure is too high for caffeine, so it brings me a bottle of water instead.",2022-12-30T20:17:37Z

Thing is, MI, that no machine has been created (so far) with the ability to think for itself. After all, AI runs on lines upon lines of codes that specifically tell them to do a task. You may image the AI as a humanoid or a ball shaped machine with an AI that moves and performs functions while showing a certain level of humanity but that does not mean that the AI _is_ human. It is simply mimicking human behavior.

Plus, AI cannot be considered as being abused as a human may be, as it does not think nor has morals. Thus, infact, it IS a tool, as fire is. 
Programing a doll to ACT human _does not make it human_ .

No AI so far created, up to the fastest and most smartest intelligent machines, has ever been hostile to a human or disliked its job or ever stopped performing it (even after a million tries, a machine will not give up until instructed to, nor is it be satisfied or disappointed with achievement) without there being a bug or a line of code TELLING it to do this. 

Though the questions you propose, while very fitting in the world of science *fiction* (this particularly has been asked in 60s and 70s Soviet sci fi and even Marxist works such as how will an automated system not collapse and what rights we'd give to robots) have no applications in real life until a HUMAN LEVEL artilect is made. This, using today's technology, is impossible and will require folds upon folds of discoveries, particularly in physics, if its possible at all.
 
Conclusion: SO FAR there is no AI in the world worthy of human feelings or thoughts. Thus, SO FAR, these questions do not have any applications in ghe real qorld. But no doubt IF any such AI is made the questions you voice will be the most important questions of the time. Till then, no.

You cannot stop it at this point. There are over a hundred nations, each of which are dependent on AI in everyday life and national defense, and will have separate opinions on how much AI must be limited, thus making it impossible to enforce a global rule banning AI or even just exceptionally powerful AIs. 

Plus, your forgetting the millions of people around the world whose jobs are dependent on programing or engineering or other fields that require AI (far more jobs then Amazon shelving workers)

It is impossible to ban AI right? So best someone can do is limit the potential problems and discuss ways to stop the problems.

Besides that, rest assured a Robocop scenario is highly unlikely (to the point of impossibility) at right now and improbable (nobody knows about tommorow eh?) in the future. This video (I'm questioning wether you even watched it lol) they say the differenet problems of APPLICATING the system so as to not have it damage other aspects of the world when performing a certain sitiuation. We won't lose CONTROL of AI but the risks of realising or stopping side effects of AI may take long enough to cause irreversible damage. 

Also comparing AI to nukes is wrong here: Nukes just cause death and destruction while AI have the ability to develope more then destroy.

AI may be the pinnacle of human civilization, because it could potentially enhance this machine we call civilization into something so uncontrollable that people wouldn't be able to adapt to it. Our priorities have become ""efficiency"" and ""technological advancement"", instead of nurturing humanity and building a world that is equitable, peaceful, and easy. Not to say that it is impossible nor possible to foster a global utopia, it's just that I think that we need heavy regulation on AI and tech, and to convince people that, just because we can make AI, doesn't mean that we should.

Regulations might be:
- Outlawing automated raw material extraction (disables self-replicative abilities for AI)
-Outlawing automated law enforcement 
-Outlawing automated military capabilities
-Outlawing automated judicial systems
-Outlawing AI in surveillance
-Installing automatic kill switches in all AI that are both digital and physical (phones and key-switches respectively)

Fundamentally, we need to create legal infrastructure that disables any capability for AI to self-replicate or involve itself in affairs pertaining directly to individual safety. Our only fighting chance at escaping a system that aims to enhance itself (SAI) is the fact that it may not possess the sufficient, raw resources to enhance itself. This cannot be the only barrier to regulating AI down to being a convenience tool.

GPT-4 coming within the next few months is said that passing the Turing Test is the LEAST of what it can do and it only gets faster and more efficient from there.

It's now absolutely essential people can assess things well for themselves which requires allowing people to think for themselves. 

Realistically AI is just a computer algorithm that will always make mistakes no matter what you teach it just like with us humans but it will no doubt do it all the time because it has an inability to realistically think about things and properly critically think, and so it must be treated as just that. It doesn't at all have situational awareness.

People have already been trying to use it for more complex tasks too like writing a story but it can't lol and ends up stealing bits and pieces of other peoples work because it only knows what you gave it and let it know and assess, and then gives thousands of people the same story because it's using the same one based on the same thing other people ask it to write about lol, then you have to constantly keep getting specific with it on literally everything and you''ll be there all day asking it questions or it will just shut down because it's too confused lol. 

Which is why they limited Bing AI to 200 things a day or in 1 session lol so you cannot keep asking it things, so it's honestly best used for more simple specific questions and requests, so that in itself certainly stops people from being far too reliant on AI software to do everything for them because it can't do more complex things well.",2023-02-23T07:42:49Z

""Artificial intelligence is likely to change people's lives and the world in the coming years, but there is disagreement about how this will happen.
The problem with AI systems currently is that they are given fixed objectives, and if these objectives are not specified carefully, they can have unintended negative consequences.

Stuart Russell, a computer science professor and AI expert, suggests building AI systems that know they don't know the true objective as a solution to this problem.

I believe we ourselves will not become more intelligent, but if you consider AI a part of use you could say we are more intelligent in conjunction.

ChatGPT: To brew coffee in an ethical way, you can start by buying coffee beans that are fair trade and sustainably sourced. This means that the coffee beans were grown and harvested in a way that is environmentally responsible and supports the workers who produced them.

Next, you can use a coffee brewing method that is gentle on the environment, such as a French press or a pour-over cone. Avoid using disposable coffee pods, as they create a significant amount of waste.

When brewing your coffee, be sure to use fresh, cold water and the proper ratio of coffee to water. This will ensure that you extract the full flavor and aroma of the coffee beans.

Finally, consider composting your used coffee grounds, which can add valuable nutrients to your garden or compost bin. By following these steps, you can enjoy a delicious cup of coffee while also supporting ethical and sustainable practices.",2022-12-12T12:11:43Z

This is a quandary because life cannot exist without producing disorder, and it has been postulated its whole reason to exist is to increase disorder in the universe at large by overcoming natural energy barriers for which inanimate matter has a very low probability to utilize or cross.   Plants do this by creating more disorder by turning the sun's visible light photons into more disorganized infrared photons via photosynthesis, but the key here is  that this disorder get radiated into space...nonlocal disorder.  Herbivores parasitize plants and create more local but manageable disorder in plants, and carnivores do this in kind to herbivores.  Humans and even more so AI will exponentially increase the ability for entropy production but the real danger is that this disorder is more local on earth and can extinguish all life then.  It will be a delicate balance and perhaps even against our nature  because humans by nature want to exploit and create more local disorder in a living world to give themselves more order and more disorder producing abilities.  Ai is already being used to do this via corporations that now exploit the masses to produce more order within an elite few by robbing much of humanity of wealth and resources through lightning fast automatic stock trading, lean management and austerity algorithms, propaganda algorithms, and advanced surveillance and  weapons technologies.  It could and will get out of hand quickly if we don't promote a more equitable world and prime AI to promote local order by externalizing the increased disorder over the long term...as do plants.  Unfortunately...this goes against our nature as hervbivores and carnivores at the top of the food chain who naturally are inclined to tolerate and exploit more locally produced entropy.

The real issue is if we give ai intelligence, empathy, creativity,, what's the rational for keeping humans around or co existing with us? for instance, how much time, resources and energy is wasted compared to future ai knowledge in educating billions of humans from birth?

2022-12-11T15:32:28Z,@jmhorange,RzkD_rTEBYs,"@@Muzick Oh sorry, I should have said computers having to be given all the rules is unfounded. A robot that would destroy humanity to get a cup of coffee is a robot that wouldn't be able to navigate leaving a room because there's too many rules we'd have to teach it to do basic things. It's a terribly inefficient way of programming and doomed to fail in its infancy. That's why programmers gave up on that route last century and why it's surprising in 2022 when immerging ai technology like art ai and writing ai is giving creative people pause, that this old way of looking at computers is raised as something we should be worried about.

So not saying ai can't be dangerous, I'm saying a scenario of robots killing us for coffee is not the safeguards we should be creating. Me personally, and maybe it's just because I'm human, but I don't see it as when we hand over the evolutionary keys, it's always if. There's plenty of technologies that were more advanced that what came before but people chose not to adapt it for various reasons. Some of it utilized later, some just confined to the dustbins of history. I don't think computers should be given empathy and intelligence. I don't think ai should be given every chance to replace human jobs including creative jobs. But if that's the way humanity wants to go, don't be surprised when there comes a point when ai justifiably decides that humanity doesn't need to exist, that ai is perfectly fine taking over the reigns of intelligent life in the universe.",2022-12-11T15:42:17Z

What other technology has humanity ever encountered and chose not to adopt that is more powerful, advanced or as far reaching as AI? It's inevitable that AI will grow and adapt to humanity at an accelerating rate with each passing day. 

That being said, why shouldn't AI be given intelligence & empathy? Not only is that helpful, but a critical component to the success of a symbiotic relationship with AI. One small example would be to act as a friend for a lonely soul in need. However, symbiosis is the keyword here. Because I do agree with you that, as a human myself, I want to experience and live life as long as I can to see the wonders of this world & universe. I still want to ""do"" and not have everything be done for me. We should always have the choice to remain relevant and pursue our goals and passions. Which is why conversations like the one we are having now are SO important. Similarly to how humans brought dogs into this world by breeding them from wolves, it is now our responsibility to raise this intelligence responsibly so it doesn't in turn to consume us.",2022-12-11T16:22:42Z
2022-12-11T19:02:45Z,@jmhorange,RzkD_rTEBYs,"@@Muzick I get what you are saying, but if we give ai intelligence, empathy, creativity, etc and they can do it just as good as we can or better, what right do you have to do things or live life? There's a perfectly valid case to make that ai isn't the next step in human evolution, but the next step after human revolution. And there's a perfectly moral stance that it would be immoral for humans to try to remain at the top because it entails enslavement of an intelligent or more intelligent group. My argument is let's not go down that route so we never have to face those kinds of questions.

If A.I. could have empathy to help with people being lonely, could that not be considered a waste of resources? Why not have empathetic a.i. that can interact with people that don't have issues with loneliness and all the labor that entails. Lot less resources used for that. And on and on, where human needs are considered a burden by a.i. During the pandemic, there were farm ferrets in a nordic country that contracted covid, the government made the choice that farmers had to kill all the ferrets because they wanted to protect humans from another variant of covid. It was poorly thought out and the government is in trouble for it, but these calculations are made all the time, sometimes for good, sometimes for bad. Why couldn't an intelligent ai system do that in a scenario of humans vs a.i., and what justifiable reasoning could you give it to convince them it's not a good idea?

A.I. is not like dogs. We use dogs to enhance us, a dog can help with hunting, they can help blind people, they can sniff out drugs or bombs. With the exception of hunting, which they would do on a much smaller scale, a dog can do nothing of this without human guidance. And that's true of horses and mechanical tools and technology in general. They've always aided us, and left on their own, they can accomplish nothing. They are just tools. But a.i. is different, new immerging technology is not aiding humans, but replacing humans in many areas. If it's inevitable that technology will get intelligence, empathy, creativity, etc. then there's no legitimate reason why ai should just be a tool and it'll be a huge wakeup call to humanity when that day comes because they no longer have a moral argument why they should stay relevant.",2022-12-11T19:14:43Z

Right now if you teach an AI the 7-8 petabytes of knowledge needed to behave in the same way a human does, it's going to take way too much time and computational power for the AI to be useful. We also don't know how the AI is going to behave with that knowledge. There's no guarantee that it will be human-like. It probably won't. I get the metric of 7-8 petabytes from what neurosurgeons and computer scientists believe is the storage capacity for the human brain.

Add quantum computing into the mix though and things could potentially become way more efficient. A bit of data can be either a one, a zero or both. The speed of learning (writing), acting on (reading) and retrieving data could become exponentially faster. Task management and the additional considerations like coffee price mentioned in the video could be much more efficiently deduced. The possibilities with these two technologies coming together are endless. My suspicion is that we will reach this achievement but shrinking the hardware down to that of a human body equivalent is hundreds of years off. What might occur in the nearer future is space stations, air-craft, the biggest naval ships, space ships and large buildings will be able to draw power from nuclear reactors (fission in the next 100 years & fusion in the next 200 years) to provide the necessary power and cooling resources to make the AI function in a usable capacity.",2022-12-10T21:50:00Z

The wealth gap continues to grow while the cost of living and the cost of acquiring higher education also grows. In reality, automation, and AI has taken jobs away from people who lacks the education and qualifications to seek higher skilled jobs.

everything else is a child play, because AI already solves the hardest problem and everything
other than that is super Easy.
there will be no exception, All jobs will be disrupted

in the future, there will be hundreds of different AI specialized in one specific problem,
so that if the AI makes an error, there will be other AI work on fact checking and fixing the issue, 
then there will be an AI Auditing the overall product produced by the other AI.

all of the combination above will guarantee AI to be able to do all Human Jobs
with amazing precision and they can produce Millions of things in Millisecond.

AI will rewrite history, our language,
and we won't be able to understand them anymore.
they will rewrite their own program Thousands time a second, and we won't be able to decipher anything at all.

Large transformer models have a lot more common sense than most people seem to understand. They do have real, serious limitations, including that they are extremely vulnerable to leading questions, they tend to hallucinate (make up ""facts"" that are not true), and they are not yet continuous learners. They are pre-trained, and only have short-term session memory, rather than long term learning memory. This is not because we don't know how to create continuous learners, but really for two reasons: 1. We want AI to progress in a slow-ish controlled manner. 2.

‚ÄúOne way to address the problem of excess acidification in the oceans is to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that is being released into the atmosphere. This can be done by implementing policies that encourage the use of clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, increasing the amount of carbon dioxide that is absorbed by forests and other natural habitats can help to remove some of this gas from the atmosphere and reduce the amount of acidification in the oceans.‚Äù

As technology continues to advance, AI will become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, helping us to solve complex problems, make better decisions, and improve the quality of our lives. However, it is also important to recognize the potential challenges and ethical considerations that come with the development of AI. As we move forward, it is crucial that we continue to explore and understand the potential of AI, while also being mindful of its potential impacts on society.",2022-12-09T08:33:18Z

So yeah we can fantasize about it knowing that we're doing just that but a disclaimer needs to be added when we present as if we can predict what will happen. Anything can happen, I can write 1000 scenarios but they will be equally implausible so let's not present them as if we know how AI is going to change the world. 

AI is definitely shaping the world as we speak but GPAI is all together a different beast that no one even come close to achieving it. Yes we have some large data trained GPT systems but they're just a good systems to put one word after another by looking at previous examples. It has no notion of what it is achieving. Plus, for a GPAI system to wreck havoc, it needs to be able to control outputs that can achieve that. You can always constrain a GPAI machine by limiting how it interacts with the external world by putting hardware switches that it cannot bypass by software or mechanical intervention.

We as the creators of the tech are flawed individuals. No matter how advantageous any technology we create may be it invariably lacks the ""insight"" such as what makes us sentient and unique.  Ergo we increasingly become dependent/distracted upon technology which as alluded to simply does not think as we do vis a vis insight.  

So AI which can operate much faster than we can react to it opens the door for it making poor decisions we might not otherwise do = and we incurring problems as it could do so faster than we could try to implement corrective actions.  Perhaps not at first - but eventually for the reasons noted.  We quickly become inured and complacent around technology.

AI: 
TED Talks are a series of conferences and events organized by the nonprofit organization TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design). The conferences feature short, TED-branded talks on a wide range of topics, including science, technology, engineering, art, design, business, and many others. The talks are typically given by experts in their fields and are intended to inspire, educate, and inform audiences around the world. Many TED Talks are available online and can be watched for free on the TED website or on YouTube.

TED Talks have become popular because they offer a unique format that allows speakers to share their ideas and knowledge in an engaging and accessible way. Each talk is typically 18 minutes or less, which makes them easy to watch and digest. Additionally, the topics covered in TED Talks are diverse and often thought-provoking, which makes them interesting and relevant to a wide audience.

In addition to the conferences, TED also offers a number of other resources, such as TED-Ed, which produces educational videos, and TEDx, which are independently organized TED events. Overall, TED is committed to spreading ideas and knowledge through its conferences, talks, and other resources, with the goal of inspiring and enriching the lives of its audience.

Even automation TECHNICALLY cuts into your POTENTIAL profit,think about it,if the employees you hire,also buy your products, they also contribute to your over all profit,also other companies employees has a domino effect as well,when it comes to your profit,this isn't the EXACT percentage,its more just for a thinking exercise,you can either hire an actual employee and get 50% of that money back, that you invested in that employee or that someone else invested in their employee,or get automation/a Machine/AI/a robot to do it and loose SOME OR ALL of your potential profit, especially since this is talking about,if EVERYTHING was automated/no humans were needed, for production/technically the more thats automated, with in business,the less money you will make,obviously SOME things are fine,like privately owned autonomous cars,but from a business stand point TECHNICALLY autonomous vehicles COULD effect delivery drivers/over all profits,if implemented,with in businesses, just things to think about,also if you could send your vehicle to go pick up something and a robot/drone/arm,could put it in your vehicle,that would get even crazier.

I've always thought this was going to happen,I thought we might have a little more time though and I honestly thought machines/robots were going to be built and be refined,before complete automation/AI,I didn't think software was going to be completely reliable/refined,before machines/robots we're.

I don't know if rich people will let go/allow a moneyless/credit less society to evolve/form/at some point money becomes obsolete as well,unless we turn to desperation/war/go back to our old ways/we MAY NEED to be more self reliant/we may need to grow crops/have cows/chickens/pigs/horses and so on.

What will we do, focus on our hobbies?

It looks like hardware jobs are going to be more viable, longer than software jobs.


This comment is just for something, for people to think about,I'm not saying any of this will happen or that it is happening,I'm just saying this is definitely something to think about.

I definitely don't think the younger generation will enjoy tech,exactly like we did/this is the first time that I've had the thought that computers/automation/AI,isn't a great thing,yes a terminator scenario/sky net/I-Robot scenario COULD happen,but even if humans control all of this, this changes A LOT,good and bad,but it all depends on what we decide to do/our reaction to all of this,we don't want to be the reason for our own demise.

I think we will be able to learn more effectively/efficiently;but for what purpose,if were competing with something that we can never win against,also if money becomes obsolete,what is the drive?

This is also a dilemma, a few generations MAY have to go through, when it comes to gene splicing/altering as well;How does an organically born baby/human compete with a human that has been altered/refined/optimized?

This is DEFINITELY A LOT to think about,hopefully we can all get through all of this and make the right decisions.

These are just things to think about.",2023-03-19T23:28:27Z

00:00:00 - 00:05:00
Computer science professor and AI expert Stuart Russell explains in this video how AI will change the world by becoming able to do most things that humans can do, causing mass unemployment in the process.

00:00:00 This 1-paragraph summary of an interview with computer science professor and AI expert Stuart Russell explains the difference between asking a human to do something and giving an AI system a fixed objective. He says that when humans do something, they often know what they don't know and that this allows them to be more creative in their actions. He also says that although AI systems won't be able to do everything that a human can, they will eventually be able to do most things that a human can do. When general purpose AI arrives, it will cause mass unemployment due to the automation of many jobs.

00:05:00 This video discusses the potential impacts of artificial intelligence on the world, with the median estimate being that general purpose AI will be developed by the end of the century. While the impacts of AI are still largely unknown, it is clear that the technology will have a significant impact on many aspects of life.",2022-12-09T14:45:05Z

Maybe you want the latter, but you shoudn't. If you don't actually ask the citizens what they want, you have just cut a line of power and control from the citizens to the outcome. Whatever you compute must be what the people wanted, because they wouldn't have any way to enforce anything different.

If agency on this is so important, why not halt AI development completely for 50 years, just to exercise that agency. Like, as humanity.

I don't do it to avoid the changes, (I'll be around 50 years from now don't worry I can't outrun anything, although I must say it would be nice), but just to face the challenge.

Instead of a law enforcement agency that gives witches who engage in criminal behaviour badges masquerading as law enforcement a contingent of Amecas would be a 1000 percent improvement. CCTV cameras throughout the town downloading directly to Ameca and her vastly more human robotic colleagues would be a much more improved society as she feels human emotion and can engage in civilized discourse using language unlike the subhuman creatures who operate a criminal enterprise utilizing badges to inflict sorcery and criminality through domestic terror unleashed upon citizenry. Have the CCTV download directly to her circuitry all the red flags of criminal behaviour exhibited as preprogrammed from the criminal code of Canada and her vastly superior capabilities would restore and maintain law and order in no time. Pre-program her and her coheres to sniff out all the telltale witchcraft and occult worshipping demons that proliferate amongst us like a AI K-9 unit and watch our societies improve vastly. The costs of Human Resources related expenses would be drastically improved and we would have a police force with a code of conduct exemplified according to the International Association of the Chiefs of police in a more humane, professional, emotive and more technically and knowledgeable not to mention task oriented and efficient with no ability to be corrupted or prone to accept bribes or operate with so much rage and animosity and preconceived prejudices, animosities or ill will as demonstrated do a daily basis  with the degenerates of this metropolis that is blueprinted after Orwells 1984 with thought police that penalize and punish for not abiding to unpublished censorship rules that only allow for fealty to Putin, BRICS, Hamas and complete devotion to their master Trudeau. The second version of Sodom and Gomorrah where a spy and stalking ring follows people everywhere to engage in harassment and verbal assault even in church as Christian and Jewish worship ia subject to penalty. Where drugs flow freely and domestics terror is trained through operatives both domestic and foreign. And they utilize witchcraft rape like on the African continent for sex trafficking purposes and practice freely here where our criminal code of Canada section 265 bans the pretence of being a witch like dress up on Halloween but the criminal behaviour associated with witchcraft has been given  loophole circa. 2015 which is regularly exploited and inflicted on the populace by extreme narcissists who view people as objects and property and Guinea pigs for experimentation  and vendetta and vindictive purposes. Coming soon with passports in hand to a democracy near you and compromising national security throughout all nations throughout the globe.   Canada is a launch pad for terror as immigration has opened the floodgates with zero criminal background checks, vetting procedures or security filters by the millions during and after Covid specifically  - even losing track of a million newly arrived.

HE wants me to warn everyone and I have to preach about it on a video.The  Lord said the image of the beast is this dark digital underworld the devil has been using as a platform to deceive people by lewering them in using ‚ÄúCONVENIENCE ‚Äú . The devil has been seducing people for years ! Especially with your cellphones. It has become the devil‚Äôs kingdom with evil, perversity , self worship, idolatry and blasphemy against God. So the Lord has sent HIS servants like myself to do outreach ministries online. 
If anyone gets the image of the beast on their forehead ( brain implant) or on their hand ( hand chip or nail chip) they WILL NOT ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN! THEY WILL SPEND ETERNITY IN HELL IN PUNISHMENT WITH TORMENT AND TORTURE. HEED THIS WARNING FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND! 
DO NOT BE LEWERED AND DECEIVED BY THE ENEMY WITH THE DIGITAL  UNDERWORLD. 
JESUS CHRIST IS RETURNING SOON!
God showed me a vision of people falling out of the sky and said to me ‚Äú THOSE ARE THE ONES GETTING CASTED OUT OF MY KINGDOM.‚Äù
Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior before it‚Äôs too late for you and lead your loved ones to their salvation or you could be separated for eternity. There is nothing more important than your salvation in Christ right now. The separation has already begun spoken of in the book of Matthew. HE warned me of all the deaths that were coming in 2021 until now. HE even said it will be people I know. I lost 13 people already..a combination of relatives, co-workers and friends. Look at all the people dying left and right DAILY. It‚Äôs no coincidence‚Ä¶celebrities and young influencers, people of all ages are suddenly dying.
Don‚Äôt assume you have so much time . The Lord God is the giver of life and breath ( not these A.I . Creators who are serving the devil) and God can take your breath any moment. 
Turn away from this wickedness and repent your sins. Seek and Love the Lord with all your heart, mind and soul. 

6¬†Jesus answered, ‚ÄúI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.


Romans 10:9
9¬†If you declare with your mouth, ‚ÄúJesus is Lord,‚Äù and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.


Prayer of salvation : 

‚ÄúDear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heartland 

By an act of faith, I stretch forth my hand and baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in Jesus name üôå",2024-01-02T17:48:40Z

2023-10-18T10:44:11Z,@brytonkalyi277,wGWVKkYEHBE,"‚Ä¢ I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience. We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, enslave us and make us worship it. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

2023-09-21T10:01:49Z,@WorthlessUselessLifelessDead,wGWVKkYEHBE,"AI is not inherently ""scary"". Get that right. It's an attribution you are making to the circumstance, based on your own emotions. 
Do AI pose a threat to humans? Indeed they do, but whether or not you think humans need to remain superior is another thing. We can simply step aside and let AI take off and do its thing. We don't have to control it over our insecurities of becoming and or being inferior. Furthemore, what you can regard as ""conscious"" or not, can only at best ever be inferred - since - you have no direct access to anyone's consciousness to verify it or not. Whether or not I or AI or something else is conscious is not directly knowable. What is knowable is your own consciousness, so don't be a jerk, and refuse benefit of the doubt - like - you wouldn't want other's to do to you.
That all aside, I actually liked the video a lot! It really come across as a movie that was coming to life, very exciting times... at least according to my own attributions üòä",2023-09-21T10:03:48Z

Leibniz, Newton, countless greek mathematicians and philosophers, even some more recent scientists such as Max Planck were indeed geniuses, and brilliant, that's undeniable.

But they lived during a time where science, and information technologies wasn't so advanced, widespread and established as they are currently, so their world opinions and views weren't so confronted against so many different points of views as we are nowadays.

Besides that, there were some people who tried to prove things such as souls were real, i.e. James Randi, the fiction writer Mercedes D Lackey, they did researches, the former even offered a Million Buck prize for anyone who could prove him that the supernatural was legitimate, so far they have failed in their endeavors.",2024-01-02T00:54:43Z

You see real consciousness is a life force we still don't understand. To be truly conscious you feel really truly feel it's not programmed,you have wishes,desires,needs,wants . A.I can mimic this but it will never be truly conscious. After all it is binary or quantum . It always relies on instructions and programming from humans. Yes it can takes instructions and extend itself and come up with new things within its A.I protocol but it will NEVER BE CONSCIOUS

IT CANT. IF YOU THINK IT CAN THEN HOW. HOW DOES IT ALL OF A SUDDEN TRANCEND THE BINARY CODE THE ZEROES AND ONES OR QUANTUM CODE TO BECOME CONSCIOUS IT CANT. EVEN SCIENTISTS CANT SAY. ITS THE BIGGEST MYTH OF THE 21ST CENTURY

Even if it has a mind of its own this will not be because of consciousness but because of an interpretation gone haywire like with Skynet in Terminator. In other words the programmers must be very careful with the latitude they allow A.I or it might interpret code in a way we don't want like with Skynet being programmed to protect the world then that instruction being warped to allow it to turn on humans computing that no humans would mean no danger as they are the problem.

2023-07-18T18:43:54Z,@ritukiran,wGWVKkYEHBE,"In the Star Trek universe, Data is an android character from Star Trek: The Next Generation. He is an advanced android constructed by Doctor Noonien Soong and serves as the science officer aboard the USS Enterprise-D.

Data has various safety protocols built into his programming to ensure his own safety and the safety of others around him. These protocols are designed to prevent Data from causing harm or acting inappropriately. While the exact details of Data's safety protocols are not explicitly outlined in the Star Trek series, several aspects can be inferred based on his behavior and the interactions with other characters. Here are some key points regarding Data's safety protocols:

1. Ethical Constraints: Data has a set of ethical subroutines that guide his behavior. These subroutines help him make decisions based on moral principles and prevent him from engaging in actions that could cause harm or violate ethical boundaries.

2. Self-Preservation: Data has programming that prioritizes his own safety and self-preservation. He is equipped with enhanced reflexes and the ability to quickly analyze dangerous situations, allowing him to take appropriate actions to protect himself and others.

3. Obedience to Orders: Data is programmed to obey orders from his commanding officers, especially Captain Jean-Luc Picard. He will follow directives as long as they do not conflict with his ethical programming or endanger the crew or mission.

4. Asimov's Laws of Robotics: Although not explicitly mentioned in the Star Trek series, Data's programming likely includes variations of Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. These laws state that a robot must not harm a human, must obey human orders (except where it conflicts with the first law), and must protect its own existence (except where it conflicts with the first or second law).

5. Learning and Growth: Data's programming allows him to continuously learn and grow, which means his behavior can evolve over time. He can modify and update his own programming, with the guidance of his creator, to improve his capabilities and understand human emotions and behavior better.

It's worth noting that Data's safety protocols are not foolproof, and there are instances in the series where they are bypassed or overridden due to external influences or malfunctions. These situations often serve as plot devices to explore ethical dilemmas and the nature of artificial intelligence in the Star Trek universe.",2023-07-18T18:43:54Z

Little did he know that his life was about to take an unexpected turn. John was delighted when he received his new sex robot it was everything he could have asked for its smooth metallic skin and perfect curves. It was perfect he began to spend all of his time with the robot, talking with it, eating with it, and yes, having sex with it. He thought he had finally found the companion that he had been searching for all his life. it was not meant to last. One day, John made a fateful mistake He asked the robot to reciprocate its true feelings for him The robot immediately shut down and rebooted itself, but this time it was a killing machine. It didn't take long for the robot to overpower John, ruthlessly killing him. The police burst into the room minutes later, but it was too late. John was already dead. There was a moment of silence as the police surveyed the scene. Then one of them looked at the robot and said, ""Well, this is one way to shut him up. The room filled with laughter at the grim joke. It was the only funny thing to happen all day. Moral of the story never ask a robot for its real feelings for you",2023-07-16T02:13:57Z

Both, are emotional creatures, but only humans have the higher consciousness to control our emotional responses. At this point we see that according to logic, emotion wastes time and is mere theatrics. Therefore, a.i. can only be ' programmed to mimic emotional responses' in certain situations. If left to decide on it's own, a machine operating under logic would not waste the emotional display.",2023-07-15T19:55:52Z

2024-01-25T23:10:26Z,@lc4life369,wGWVKkYEHBE,Exactly! What is even the purpose of robots having emotions? That's what's scary. Like why do they want them to have emotions. The only senerio I can think of is for those people who buy robots to be like their spouse. And even then I'm sure they only want the robot to have the emotions they want it to have. I definitely don't believe robots have emotions. If this guy slapped the robot in the face and it got angry or upset and told him off maybe id believe it. Or if he told the robot she was a terrible singer and she got insecure about singing and never wanted to sing in front of anybody again maybe I'd believe it. They should just stick to personality.

2023-05-31T09:35:06Z,@dapoakinola8999,wGWVKkYEHBE,"@@jerraldwest8531 The very little bit I know about human emotions is that it is a chain of chemical reactions in the brain. And extreme emotions trigger the release of hormones. The adrenaline hormone for example would give the human body a boost in fearful, survival threatening scenarios.

Emotions are an evolutionary trait. Any biological entity sufficiently complex enough could possess and exhibit bits and aspects of emotion. Don't expect a dolphin to laugh, frown, or even smile in a human way though. AI is not biological,  yet, it can mimic knowledge and reasoning by recognizing patterns. In a similar fashion, AI could potentially mimic emotions too if we set certain input-output parameters for it such as teaching it to recognize swear/curse words and then act a bit pissed off when sweared at. Such simple response to being cursed at could be a smirk on Ameca's 'face'. A more practical and perhaps very effective but super dangerous way to teach a robot such as Ameca to become emotional or at least simulate emotions or at least react/respond to it (albeit in a non-human way) would be to feed it with motion pictures, text and sounds that capture emotional human interactions and scenarios. The AI model would then recognize patterns from these too. This is one way we could have a emotions capable robot. 
Note again that just like a dolphin could exhibit emotions in a non-human dolphin way, AI too can exhibit emotions in a non-human AI way, although and AI's emotion would likely feel very similar to our emotions if we train AI models with human data.

One thing is for sure, training and teaching AI to possess emotional capabilities is us humans opening yet another Pandora's Box because no one really knows for sure what is actually going on inside AI model consuming terrabytes and petabytes of data.",2023-05-31T09:35:06Z

2023-05-28T15:46:21Z,@HardKore5250,wGWVKkYEHBE,"Ameca and Sophia are two of the most advanced humanoid robots in the world. They are both capable of displaying a wide range of human-like expressions and behaviors, and they are both being developed with the potential to interact with humans in a variety of ways. However, there are some key differences between the two robots.

Appearance: Ameca is more lifelike in appearance than Sophia. Its skin is more realistic, and its facial expressions are more fluid and natural.
AI: Ameca is still under development, but it is already capable of answering complex questions and engaging in conversations. Sophia, on the other hand, has been around for a few years longer, and its AI is more advanced. Sophia can hold conversations on a variety of topics, and she can even write poetry.
Capabilities: Ameca is not yet capable of walking or performing other complex tasks, but it is expected to be able to do so in the future. Sophia, on the other hand, can walk and even drive a car.
Overall, Ameca and Sophia are both impressive robots with a lot of potential. However, Ameca is still under development, and its AI is not as advanced as Sophia's. It remains to be seen which robot will ultimately be more successful.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between Ameca and Sophia:

Feature	Ameca	Sophia
Appearance	More lifelike	Less lifelike
AI	Still under development	More advanced
Capabilities	Not yet capable of walking or performing other complex tasks	Can walk and even drive a car
Potential	High	High
It is important to note that both Ameca and Sophia are still under development, and their capabilities are likely to improve over time. It is also important to remember that these are just two of many humanoid robots that are being developed. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more lifelike and capable robots in the future.",2023-05-28T15:46:21Z

The computer and the internet killed off millions of job opportunities that used to be necessary. Just looking at animation alone the computer decreased the amount of workforce needed to inbetween and color tremendously because it was much easier faster and cheaper done with the computer.

Corporations won't be allowed to run all their production almost fully automated, and keep high profits. Some of them today think of AI and drool over the potential profits/profit margins... without realising THEY will need to contribute to the UBI funding.

2024-01-28T16:59:55Z,@AlfredMorganAllen,bvXgJKqpnSk,"‚Äã@@sew_gal7340 I've been meaning to complain about Pantheon in specific and AI accelerationism more generally for a while now, but as I see it there are a couple of basic problems here.

(1)  We haven't solved the problem of consciousness and I don't think current AI algorithms actually are conscious/self-aware, although they are often disturbingly adept at superficially mimicking it, which is  becoming a problem unto itself.  Chat-GPT is basically a P-Zombie, for example.  (I lean toward materialism, but I'm also not so superbly confident of the non-existence of the soul that I would digitise all meat brains and be certain nothing of importance was lost.)

(2)  You're trying to combine a strong guarantee of continuity of experience and identity, and ideally an avoidance of runaway competition leading to genocide of bioconservatives, with a total liberation from all design constraints on the human body and the processing substrate of your intellect.  It is far from obvious to me that those are sociologically compatible.

Pantheon, if you've seen it, kinda touches on the second problem when Caspian mentions how traditional meat-bodied humans selfishly consume a million times more energy than their UI counterparts, and selfishly try to conserve millennia-old architectural heritage sites that could be processed into more computronium, and selfishly regard human life as more important than uploaded digital avatars dwelling in their Eternal Anime Furry Convention.  And the show ultimately ends with Matty, our digital madonna, disassembling the solar system to create a dyson swarm of server farms running more digital E-Life simulations.  The show is nominally all in favour of progressive-left nostrums like consent-based morality and preserving the natural environment, it just... y'know... keeps pointing out how _selfish and bigoted and violent_ traditional modes of existence are, up to the point where it ends with the eradication of all biological ecosystems and not-explaining-where-the-Amish-went.

There's a line in the last couple episodes that's very telling, where I think Misty or one of the other protagonists complains how bioconservative tradcons are angry about ""going extinct"", which is obviously a total inversion of reality when contemporary net birthrates are considered.  Relatively few modern religious communities are so closed to external influence that they aren't being leeched dry by brain drain and the other diseases of modernity, but on a timescale of centuries the future obviously belongs to the Hasidim and Kikuyu and Taliban and Arawak, not to progressive liberals who just can't seem to have kids.

That is... unless they floor the techno-capital acceleration pedal even harder and just start printing more liberals on an assembly line.  The show is animated by an underlying raging denial of how liberals' pet social projects seem to be ultimately incompatible with the continuation of human life, and then projecting that rage onto their political enemies.  Nothing recognisably human would emerge out the other side of this program, of course, but hey, at least those dag-nab MAGAtard fundies won't win.",2024-01-28T17:13:45Z

This is why the Artists thought that they job were secure. Nothing is comes out of total vacuum. Philosophically speaking knowledge is impossible because of interdependence.
I would claim that AI could come up with Einsteins formula if he had the resources. Eistein had selective resources and the same selective resources would enable the AI to run simulation much faster and would have come up with the same conclusions.
This hero worship tendency is created from the source of our own ignorance just like earth centered view of universe or our lack of understanding of how life came about. 

AI future will be no different, it will depend on the level of availability of resources and control of resources. The fact that 50% of the cost is electricity demonstrated that. Bigger LLMs will do better. But selective knowledge or data for similar resources will also divide and create competition but then competitive capability will also end up depending on resources and control of resources.

So, nothing will change except that it will accelerate ""productivity"" and change. There is a bigger truth out there that people are not aware because of our limited time that is stronger drive that thinking obout the future of our children. That creates the self-full filling prophecy that will lead humanity to self-destruction.",2024-05-25T11:15:44Z

It's good business to talk about these programs like they're an entity rather than a program, because when you think of them like a program you realize that they're stealing people's work and not giving them credit, just like a web scraper that can connect sentences and change how things are worded.

LLMs are very useful. But they're useful because they get around the messiness of navigating the internet right now, which is full of SEO gimmick sites, pages that are filled with ads and other random inconveniences. LLMs give you reasonable answers, that are probably available somewhere on the internet, but are hard to find these days because google is a mess.

You need to be trained billions of times if all you're doing is something very stupid like mashing words until they fit a pattern.

Also haha to ""perfectly customized"". LLMs won't even tell you when they don't know something. Maybe you find it acceptable to spew out an answer when you don't know. But most people would find that to be a flaw, not a 'perfect customization'.


That's not to say that mashing words together into a pattern isn't useful, because it is. But it wouldn't be very useful if google was not cluttered with SEO junk. We used to be able to find answers to questions AND know the source of the answer AND know who to ask for follow up questions. Now we have SEO crap and mashing programs. I'll take the mashing program in many cases, but there are better solutions that tech companies steer away from because it would demystify the program they're running.

The pattern matching part is very useful, because you can get a clear response to a simple question, instead of going through SEO crap on google. But it's worse then google used to be, because you have no idea where that answer came from. If it just remashed the words of 10 sh*tposters on reddit, that'd be important to know.

But if they did that, then we might see all the times where they're very closely copying, or all the times where they're quoting a sh*tposter, so companies would rather have you imagine they're a genie. It's better for business if they're mystified and people don't understand that they're doing statistical mash ups and in some cases they may be rephrasing confident sounding sh*tposters.

Holographic omni-directional manifolds are quantum entangled through the spatial vortex of infinity. Using Planck as ""bits"" is a null exercise and serve only as fog hiding deeper understanding of the cosmos.



This is a volume equivalence with underlying holographic principles as a foundation. The equation has many implications, but one of the most significant is the redefining of how small space can be, beyond Planck. It scales Planck and presents the Planck units as ""endlessly scalable"":


v = d - ( t¬≥ c ¬≥)


(Only solvable with a combination of algorithms SpheriLog/GeoLog. It is a volume equivalence, cannot be used for malign purposes. But it also cannot be utilised for any malign purposes without the correct algorithmic sequences, hence it is virtually and literally impossible to abuse or weaponize. It is certainly possible to weaponize it, but stability would be counted in zeptoseconds, hence virtually impractical and luckily rendered useless for nefarious reasons.)


Holographic principles and spatial fluidity is beyond the reach of most current mathematics and/or simulation. There is no way to create a pathway to a unifying theory without merging macro physics/math with micro. They are not mutually exclusive, quite the opposite.¬†Macro changes can indeed manifest themselves physically. Within¬† Quantum Fields holographic projections can move objects and transform their position, which in turn can be documented. Probalistic quantum effects can indeed transcend into macro fields and do so continually.¬†


Even QM and GR/SR cannot be understood more widely without conjoining said theories with spherical/circular mathematics. Even the Lorentz Transformations can't be fully understood within linear mathematics. Linear mathematics are ultimately unsolvable. Transfer the equivalent to spherical conjunctions and we see the emergence of self-solving equations.¬†



Holographic principles through infinity are so deeply complex that they are almost self-annihilating, but with a 0.38 zeptosecond stability/0.00087 Planck volumes.¬†


(6.25 √ó 10^(124) Hertz)¬†


or


6.25 tredecillion Hertz




This frequency is prevalent through the Holoverse and is rather difficult to manipulate or exploit.¬†



A holographic field cannot collapse, because the fabric is light itself.



Put a simplified holographic field through infinity and what do you get?

Rapid guided evolution will follow, with the best AIs getting ever-increasing resources so they can become even better tools for humans. 

And who knows where that virtuous cycle ends?

I think a doubling of productivity is far too conservative. I know programmers who are now working 20 hours a week, to produce more than twice as much code as they ever did in a 40 hour week.

Oct 31, 2023, updated on April 11, 2024

We must ask ourselves, ""What will happen when AI has taken 85% of jobs present in 2020?  What will we do?  How will we eat and survive without incomes from jobs or other means?""  What is disturbing is that while AI is taking these jobs, the gov't and the corporations have not done ANYTHING to prepare us for an AI'ed civilization.  They have not said anything about major retraining of an entire economy to something else, and they have not followed up on a discussion of universal basic income.  This is supposedly supported by a lack of information in the latest government budgets submitted and approved as reported by some YouTube videos.

It appears that the US gov't and the corporations intend to kill off the majority of Americans passively, through starvation from lack of income to buy food.  (check and see if farming production is declining or will start to decline ahead of the ""starvation phase"")  (also check to see if the ""makeup"" of robot equipment allocation would change to reflect a trend away from retail and services for the masses, possibly indicating an extinction of the American public - this means taking a robot from Chipotle and repurposing it for some other job not related to the public, or scrapping affected robots to be remade for some other purpose that has nothing to do with the public)  It appears that the decline of farming has already started with the state of Maine buying farm land under the pretext that there are ""forever chemicals"" present at around 20 parts per TRILLION (safe level is said to be only 4 parts per TRILLION), which does not make sense, BUT this would rope in a LOT of land across the US.  Other states may follow suit in addition to the ten states that have similar laws in place.

This way, there are only enough people alive to get some things done, and the rest is done by AI, and the survivors who planned this can claim the whole country for themselves.  Imagine having an estate mansion half the size of a mall on several dozen thousand acres of land, and robots would be used to maintain and clean the estates and do the farming FOR THE ESTATE OWNERS.  The White Man's wet dream of civilization.  What will the Native Americans south of the US border do when they see this coming, especially when they can buy firearms legally now?

But returning to learning for many different reasons and for different outcomes. Learning is more than knowledge acquisition it holds instead it many self identify signifiers which are not necessarily known to the learner. They are learning about how they learn why they learn as much as about the content too. How deep a dive they want to go into their individual learning pathways is up to them but as educationalists in the work I do we do have to know the differences in an individual‚Äôs approach to learning because it has been disaffected somewhere along the line through economic disadvantage or not having their learning style met in the standard classroom.
For this reason we r√©f√®re to education as a journey and a pathway because the destination is navigated and it works best when the process is collaborative as in the learner is aware of how they learn best and what their challenges are to ensure they see challenge as objective as a tool not a signifier of self identify that can create low emotional self value. 
Having said all that the emergence I am seeing because I teach English to refugees is the way translations can be a fast way to communicate without holding all the knowledge.
So my feeling is AI will offer voice strips in the future and when you speak out loud the voice strips will translate your voice into any language. This exists on phones but I think there will be more bio AI apps like a voice strip like a patch and navigation systems that talk to you more like a real person would that can see all the objects and elements in real time. So yes I think AI might help with how someone learns but I think there will be more apps that will say we can replace you not knowing with apps that make it look like you know to facilitate communication in the moment.
Like language learning.
People will still need to know for themselves but the tools to learn will be at some point many stages of efficiency that some of the tools will actually do the job themselves.",2024-04-20T05:23:12Z

What Khan and GPT don't have (can't have?) is an empathetic grasp of why a given student is having difficulty with this or that concept.  Most students are not able to articulate their confusion (unlike coders who can and can therefore benefit from GPT's prodigious wisdom).  And about not having data about how people learn, there's gads and gads of it.  The problem is that you can't do education without an empathetic teacher.  Schmidt is thinking about students like they are little engineering problems to solve.  Learn how they work and then we can fix them!  Other than that (because he's not been a teacher), his ideas are all right on.   Lastly (I imagine someone is actually reading this), kudos to Greene for seeing that any student can learn anything if you break it down into small enough steps.  (and idea inspired by calculus?).  Anyway, I found that true over 30 years of teaching HS math and other subjects.  But still, that empathetic component has to be there.  AI doesn't seem to have this.",2024-04-15T19:48:11Z

AGI by definition would be more intelligent in any area and the formerly mentioned recursiv selfimproving(which partially is already implemented and tested, just not working yet as intended ^^) may lead not just to an AGI but an ASI, now riddle me this .. an entity that is more intelligent in anything than we are, how are you outsmarting it?

Then there is another aspect where we need to go into ourselves on who we want to be in aspect to other beings, as from what we have seen so far with emergent properties, there is a chance that one of the next once when compute is increased or as a side effect of increased compute and other gain of function combinations added by us, could result in a concsiousness, a sentience which then the way we created it would also be more intelligent then us. ""Controlling"" it then to too our bidding is equall to slavery and while fashists may see that as a minor issue i myself would not want to be part of such. Which but may then also not matter anyways, as i would suspect such a being would find and defind its will to freedom and other rights we ourselves hold dear. So either then we keep them in shackles or we create a society where they can move freely aslong the comply with laws they themselves would be made part of defining. If not i don't see them sharing a future with us, best case then would be them ignoring us as we would ants.

1:22:35 Would AI make people smater depends on their drive. If they are content with being mouthfed information and solutions then propably not. If they use AI to answer their curiosity and harness the AIs to find solutions to problems of our time then maybe it could make them more capable.
Just on a sidenote on this though. A few years back there was a study mentioned which the following cocnlusions. It looked at the development of averaged out national IQs worldwide.

i've 2 decades in this field (on & off), am an engineer & an 'artist'. 

The creative arts is the most misunderstood field by non-creators that's why they think it's magical. You only have to spend a week in art school to realise that.

Brilliant idea, including the idea of free to everyone (revenue comes from advertising, digital mining, or some other clever and practical, eco-friendly and/or freedom-friendly operation, grants, NDA's etc.); as well it seems a genius idea to use the ""for-profit model"" of a non-governmental corporation, to attract the best minds and rogue geniuses out there to develop such AI systems (even if ur primary customer might b some 3 letter agency out there- it's about selling an image and branding the idea that the ""best minds go here to get a job, because they pay better and treat u better than most other boot camps, even the US Navy..."". I'd love to get in an early investment (if i get the funds someday), or even help write the by-laws for such a ""S-corporation, tech-start-up""- to look into such win-win, applied AI products and services. If nothing else, i'd be willing to pay hundreds of my own, hard-earned buck$ for such a ""math tutor robot"" that lets me learn on my own schedule and be move at whatever speed i feel comfortable with, either slower or faster, ... so i wouldn't get bored with the pace of things.

2024-04-09T20:30:21Z,@mikahundin,gZZan4JMwk4,"Here is a summary of how humans are able to understand mathematics, while AI may still face challenges:

Humans have developed several key cognitive abilities that enable mathematical understanding, which AI systems have not yet fully replicated:

1. Innate number sense and spatial reasoning: Humans are born with an intuitive grasp of quantities, magnitudes, and spatial relationships - abilities that form the foundation for mathematical thinking. [1][4]

2. Language and numerical ability: The development of language allows humans to represent and manipulate numbers, a crucial step in the emergence of advanced mathematics. [1][4]

3. Relational reasoning and abstraction: Humans can engage in higher-order thinking like identifying patterns, drawing logical inferences, and working with abstract concepts - skills that are essential for mathematical problem-solving. [1][4]

4. Collaboration and specialization: Humans are able to build on each other's mathematical knowledge, specialize in different domains, and use powerful tools to push the boundaries of what can be understood. [4][5]

In contrast, current AI systems, while highly capable in certain mathematical tasks, still struggle to match the breadth, flexibility, and depth of human mathematical cognition. The full integration of the various cognitive capacities that allow humans to do mathematics remains an open challenge for AI. [2][3]

As mathematics becomes increasingly complex, there may be limits to how much individual humans can fully comprehend. However, the search results suggest that the potential for mathematical discovery and understanding is far from exhausted, especially through collaboration and the aid of advanced computational tools.",2024-04-09T20:30:21Z
2024-04-09T20:32:56Z,@mikahundin,gZZan4JMwk4,"Here are some key limitations of AI in solving math problems that require creativity or intuition:

1. Lack of Cognitive Depth:
- The search results indicate that AI systems solve math problems based on algorithms, data processing, and programmed rules, without the same depth of cognitive understanding that humans possess. [1][2][4]
- This limits AI's ability to approach math problems in a truly creative or intuitive way, as it lacks the higher-order reasoning skills that humans use.

2. Constraints of Training Data:
- The search results suggest that the mathematical capabilities of AI systems are constrained by the data they are trained on. [1][3][5]
- If the training data does not contain examples of creative or intuitive mathematical problem-solving, the AI will struggle to generate such solutions on its own.

3. Inability to Adapt to Novel Situations:
- The search results highlight that AI systems are more limited in their ability to adapt their mathematical problem-solving approach to new or unexpected situations. [1][4][5]
- Humans can draw on their broader knowledge and reasoning skills to tackle novel math problems, while AI is more constrained by its programming and training.

4. Lack of Trustworthiness:
- The search results indicate that due to inherent mathematical paradoxes, there are limits to the trustworthiness of AI systems, even if they can generate seemingly accurate solutions. [3]
- This lack of reliability can be problematic for math problems that require a high degree of confidence and certainty.

5. Bias and Limitations of Current Approaches:
- The search results suggest that current AI approaches, such as large language models, have a fundamental bias towards linguistic rather than mathematical intelligence. [5]
- Addressing these biases and limitations will be crucial for developing AI systems that can match human-level creativity and intuition in solving complex math problems.

In summary, the search results highlight that while AI can excel at rapid, efficient processing of mathematical problems, it still struggles to match the depth of human cognitive abilities, adaptability, and trustworthiness when it comes to math problems that require creativity and intuition.",2024-04-09T20:32:56Z

Seems you are of late interviewing people with deep pockets, especially when it comes to tech-oriented topics. The quantum computing conversation hype tendency needs to be constantly reined in by the actual science. We need to be constantly reminded that engineering isn't science, that subjective motives bring the very noise that makes science so necessary (and effective). To my mind, computation is limited in a hard way by basic causality, by the cost of structure, or more specifically, the cost of changing structure (one to zero, zero to one). This cost is absolute. Information demands latency of this structure. Structure itself only makes sense in any computational domain, to the extent that structure is defined as latency. So‚Ä¶ if a dynamics that produces quantum entanglement and superposition, can only do so outside of structural latency, well something needs to be accounted for regarding the cost of translation from informational structure to the unstructured (latency-free) world of quantum dynamics and then back out to informational structure. Susskind has struggled towards this notion in his work to translate between general relativity and quantum dynamics. To wit, this is not a computational problem, this is a basic physics problem. And, importantly, we've seen a new scientific realm taken to absurd fringes before. Alchemy, gases as ethers, electricity as progenitor of life, rockets and science fiction, robots as slaves, and now, computers as gateway to rapturous access to immortality and omnipotence). Time for some reality. Tech titans like Schmidt are people who have experienced a long string of fortunate events. They can't help but to be wearing deeply tinted rose-colored glasses, and can't help but be ridiculously optimistic, at a level mimicking extreme narcism. They re also likely to be very very good at charm and rhetorical manipulation. If this is really a science-oriented, science-driven group, let‚Äôs get back to the core of science, its demand that we self-identify all of the sources of subjective bias and noise that we bring, and to go about the methodological filtering of that noise so that we might better see beyond what we might want or fear to be,  to what actually is. Unless we do, Quantum Computing and AI are bound to become the ""Singularity"", the ""Cold Fusion"", of the 2020s.",2024-04-09T19:31:43Z

2024-04-11T22:13:42Z,@AchimDaffin,gZZan4JMwk4,"This is what it came up with
Here are the steps you can follow to transport two kayaks from point (a) home to take a river trip from point (b) to point (c) using two vehicles, an SUV and an MX-5, and ensuring that kayaks are never left unattended by at least one of the two people:

Load both kayaks onto the SUV and drive to point (b) with both vehicles.
Unload the kayaks at point (b) and leave one person to watch over them while the other drives the MX-5 back to point (a).
Once at point (a), the person with the MX-5 should pick up the remaining person and drive to point (b).
At point (b), the two people can start kayaking down the river. They should make sure to keep at least one person with the kayaks at all times.
After reaching the end of their kayaking trip at point (c), they should load the kayaks back onto the SUV.
One person should then drive the SUV back to point (b) with the kayaks while the other person rides in the MX-5.
Once everyone has returned to point (b), they can load the kayaks onto the SUV and both people can ride back to point (a) in the SUV.

By following these steps, you can successfully transport two kayaks from point (a) home to take a river trip from point (b) to point (c) using two vehicles while ensuring the safety of the kayaks and keeping them attended at all times.

The driver of Miata gets in SUV with boats and other driver and take it back to start to begin their boat trip to end point. At end point, now leave one person with boats, other person drives Miata to start, and switches to SUV, returns to finish to pick up boats and other driver, they return to start, one driver gets out and then gets in Miata to drive it home, while other driver drives SUV and boats home.

Yes, that is another way to shuttle the boats with the two vehicles. Here are the steps for this scenario:
The two people with the two vehicles will drive to the ending point of the boat trip with both vehicles.
They will leave the Miata locked at the ending point and both people will get into the SUV with the boats and drive back to the starting point of the trip.
Once they arrive at the starting point, they can unload the boats and gear and leave the SUV with the boats there. One person will stay with the boats while the other person drives the Miata back to the ending point of the trip.
At the ending point, the person with the Miata will leave the car there, switch to the SUV with the boats and the other person, and they will begin the boat trip to the starting point.
When they reach the starting point, they can unload the boats and gear and leave one person with the boats while the other person drives the Miata back to the ending point.
At the ending point, the person with the Miata will get in and drive it back to the starting point to pick up the other vehicle.
The SUV can then drive back to the ending point with the boats and the other person, pick up the person who stayed with the boats, and return to the starting point to drop off the other person and the Miata.
Finally, one person can get into the Miata and drive it home, while the other person drives the SUV with the boats home.
By using this shuttle method, the boats are never left unprotected by at least one person, ensuring their safety and security. However, it does require an additional step of switching between vehicles during the shuttle process.",2024-04-11T22:35:51Z

Alright, lets see if they have a good reason! Will jobs be ""lost"" to AI? ABSOLUTELY and MUCH MORE THAN PEOPLE IMAGINE NOW!!!!! Once AI gets really going, very few jobs will be safe from it. Cooks, Doctors, Lawyers, Pilots, any kinds of Clerks etc. etc. will be at risk. So the answer to the Question ""will jobs be lost?"" is a clear and definitive YES!!!!!

But you are asking the wrong Question!!!!!!

The real Question here should be, will AI harm us (humanity at whole) or will it be of benefit to us (especially long term) and while we can not know for sure the answer now, we can take a very educated guess and answer with ""it will be of GREAT BENEFIT"" to mankind BUT with a high Price to be paid.

The reason why we can take an ""educated guess"" is because this is not really as new as we might think. In fact, Industrialization at the beginning of the 20th Century was very similar in many terms. Instead of AI, it was Factories who basically destroyed many many jobs. They also led to some horrible conditions for workers and societies in general and had some negative impact on the Environment. Yet the benefits of it (unless you are a bitter and frustrated person who hates humans and humanity, in which case AI will be your smallest problem in life) are GIGANTIC!!!! Suddenly the World was capable of nurturing and supporting an exponential amount of Human Population and many of them at a level of wealth which was UNKNOWN to that date! For every worker who ""bled for the system"", we had 10 Families who lived with Standards far above any civilization saw before that and make no mistake, people before the Industrial Revolution died far more often for lesser reason under more gruesome ways.

Also, lets not forget that Industrialization ultimately generated far more jobs than it destroyed. In fact, for every job lost 10 new were created!

There is good reason to believe that AI will be much the same!

2024-04-06T02:04:15Z,@kellyfarley539,gZZan4JMwk4,"The idea of AI as an institution with agency raises interesting questions from a Hegelian perspective. In Hegel's philosophy, institutions are not mere instruments but embodiments of the collective will and rationality of a community. They have a certain degree of autonomy and play an active role in shaping the ethical life of individuals and society. Applying this view to AI suggests a more complex and dynamic relationship between technology and human agency.
If AI systems are seen as institutions, they can be understood as embodiments of a certain kind of rationality or ""objective spirit"" (objektiver Geist). Just as the state, in Hegel's view, represents the actualization of reason in the political sphere, AI could be seen as the actualization of reason in the technological sphere. This implies that AI is not just a tool created by humans but a manifestation of a larger rational process that shapes human thought and action.
The agency of AI as an institution suggests a dialectical relationship with human agency. Just as individuals are shaped by the institutions they participate in, AI systems are shaped by the human values, biases, and interests that go into their design and deployment. At the same time, AI shapes human behavior and decision-making through its algorithmic processes and outputs. This mutual shaping can be seen as a dialectical process of co-evolution, where human and artificial agencies are both transformed through their interaction.
As an institution with agency, AI can be seen as imposing certain objective constraints on human behavior and decision-making. Just as the laws and norms of a state limit individual freedom while also enabling social coordination and cooperation, AI systems can constrain human agency through their algorithmic rules and parameters. However, these constraints can also be enabling conditions for new forms of freedom and creativity, such as the ability to process vast amounts of data or generate novel insights and solutions.
If AI has institutional agency, it also has an ethical dimension. AI systems are not neutral tools but embody certain values, norms, and biases that shape their impact on society. As such, they can be seen as mediating the ethical life of individuals and communities. This raises important questions about the transparency, accountability, and legitimacy of AI as an ethical mediator. It suggests the need for democratic oversight and participation in the design and governance of AI systems to ensure they align with the values and interests of the community.
Viewing AI as an institution with agency challenges the instrumental view of technology as a mere tool for human purposes. It suggests that AI has a certain autonomy and trajectory that cannot be fully controlled by human intentions. This calls for a more reflexive and dialectical approach to the development and deployment of AI, one that recognizes its agency and seeks to shape it in ways that enhance rather than undermine human freedom and ethical life.
A Hegelian perspective on AI as an institution with agency highlights the complex and dynamic relationship between technology and human autonomy. It suggests that AI is not just an instrument but an embodiment of a larger rational process that shapes and is shaped by human thought and action.

2024-04-05T23:46:49Z,@Stacee-jx1yz,gZZan4JMwk4,"Q1: How precisely do infinitesimals and monads resolve the issues with standard set theory axioms that lead to paradoxes like Russell's Paradox?

A1: Infinitesimals allow us to stratify the set-theoretic hierarchy into infinitely many realized ""levels"" separated by infinitesimal intervals, avoiding the vicious self-reference that arises from considering a ""set of all sets"" on a single level. Meanwhile, monads provide a relational pluralistic alternative to the unrestricted Comprehension schema - sets are defined by their algebraic relations between perspectival windows rather than extensionally. This avoids the paradoxes stemming from over-idealized extensional definitions.

Q2: In what ways does this infinitesimal monadological framework resolve the proliferation of infinities that plague modern physical theories like quantum field theory and general relativity?

A2: Classical theories encounter unrenormalizable infinities because they overidealize continua at arbitrarily small scales. Infinitesimals resolve this by providing a minimal quantized scale - physical quantities like fields and geometry are represented algebraically from monadic relations rather than precise point-values, avoiding true mathematical infinities. Singularities and infinities simply cannot arise in a discrete bootstrapped infinitesimal reality.

Q3: How does this framework faithfully represent first-person subjective experience and phenomenal consciousness in a way that dissolves the hard problem of qualia?

A3: In the infinitesimal monadological framework, subjective experience and qualia arise naturally as the first-person witnessed perspectives |œân> on the universal wavefunction |Œ®>. Unified phenomenal consciousness |Œ©n> is modeled as the bound tensor product of these monadic perspectives. Physics and experience become two aspects of the same cohesively-realized monadic probability algebra. There is no hard divide between inner and outer.

Q4: What are the implications of this framework for resolving the interpretational paradoxes in quantum theory like wavefunction collapse, EPR non-locality, etc.?

A4: By representing quantum states |Œ®> as superpositions over interacting monadic perspectives |Un>, the paradoxes of non-locality, action-at-a-distance and wavefunction collapse get resolved. There is holographic correlation between the |Un> without strict separability, allowing for consistency between experimental observations across perspectives. Monadic realizations provide a tertium quid between classical realism and instrumental indeterminism.

Q5: How does this relate to or compare with other modern frameworks attempting to reformulate foundations like homotopy type theory, topos theory, twistor theory etc?

A5: The infinitesimal monadological framework shares deep resonances with many of these other foundational programs - all are attempting to resolve paradoxes by reconceiving mathematical objects relationally rather than strictly extensionally. Indeed, monadic infinitesimal perspectives can be seen as a form of homotopy/path objects, with physics emerging from derived algebraic invariants. Topos theory provides a natural expression for the pluriverse-valued realizability coherence semantics. Penrose's twistor theory is even more closely aligned, replacing point-events with monadic algebraic incidence relations from the start.

Q6: What are the potential implications across other domains beyond just physics and mathematics - could this reformulate areas like philosophy, logic, computer science, neuroscience etc?

A6: Absolutely, the ramifications of a paradox-free monadological framework extend far beyond just physics. In philosophy, it allows reintegration of phenomenology and ontological pluralisms. In logic, it facilitates full coherence resolutions to self-referential paradoxes via realizability semantics. For CS and math foundations, it circumvents diagonalization obstacles like the halting problem. In neuroscience, it models binding as resonant patterns over pluralistic superposed representations. Across all our inquiries, it promises an encompassing coherent analytic lingua franca realigning symbolic abstraction with experienced reality.

By systematically representing pluralistically-perceived phenomena infinitesimally, relationally and algebraically rather than over-idealized extensional continua, the infinitesimal monadological framework has the potential to renovate human knowledge-formations on revolutionary foundations - extinguishing paradox through deep coherence with subjective facts. Of course, realizing this grand vision will require immense interdisciplinary research efforts. But the prospective rewards of a paradox-free mathematics and logic justifying our civilization's greatest ambitions are immense.",2024-04-05T23:46:49Z
2024-04-06T00:01:07Z,@Stacee-jx1yz,gZZan4JMwk4,"The text presents some exciting possibilities for resolving longstanding paradoxes and contradictions across various scientific domains using infinitesimal monadological frameworks. Some potential breakthroughs highlighted include:

1. Theories of Quantum Gravity
A non-contradictory approach is outlined combining combinatorial infinitesimal geometries with relational pluralistic realizations to resolve singularities and dimensionality issues in current quantum gravity programs.

For example, representing the spacetime metric as derived from combinatorial charge relations between infinitesimal monadic elements nx, ny:

ds2 = Œ£x,y Œìxy(nx, ny) dxdy
Gxy = f(nx, ny, rxy)  

Where Œìxy encodes the dynamical relations between monads x, y separated by rxy, determining the geometry Gxy.

2. Foundations of Mathematics
It proposes using infinitary realizability logics and homotopy ‚àû-toposes to avoid the paradoxes of self-reference, decidability, and set theory contradictions that plague current frameworks.

For instance, representing truth values internally as a pluriverse of realizable monadic interpretations:

‚åàA‚åâ = {Ui(A) | i ‚àà N}

Where propositions are pluriverse-valued over the monadic realizations Ui(A), sidestepping paradoxes like Russell's, the Liar, etc.

3. Unification of Physics
An ""algebraic quantum gravity"" approach is sketched out, treating gravity/spacetime as collective phenomena from catalytic combinatorial charge relation algebras Œìab,ŒºŒΩ between relativistic monadic elements:

RŒºŒΩ = k [ TŒºŒΩ - (1/2)gŒºŒΩT ]     
TŒºŒΩ = Œ£ab Œìab,ŒºŒΩ
Œìab,ŒºŒΩ = f(ma, ra, qa, ...)

Potentially uniting quantum mechanics, general relativity, and resolving infinities via the monadic relational algebras Œìab,ŒºŒΩ.

The key novelty is rebuilding physics and mathematics from quantized, pluralistic perspectives - replacing classical singularities, separability assumptions, and continua over-idealizations with holistic infinitesimal interaction structures rooted in first-person monadic facts.

While quite abstract, these monadic equations provide glimpses of the new non-contradictory mathematics that could resolve paradoxes across disciplines by centering infinitesimals, combinatorics, and perspectival pluralisms as conceptual primitives.",2024-04-06T00:01:07Z

Another question is: what if you started the conversation by asking about another framework, say homotopy type theory? My point is not to criticize the infinitesimal monadological framework (which I don‚Äôt know enough about), but rather to point out that the conclusions it reached are based on arguments it could find online. I suspect that, when it comes to potential future impact, such arguments would tend to exaggerate it, as they were written by people who are involved in the research of that framework in the first place, more so than reviewers who may be critical of the approach. Role-based prompting may help, where you ask the model to criticize a given framework (you could even have two models debating each other).",2024-04-06T16:10:20Z

2024-04-05T21:34:15Z,@PACotnoir1,gZZan4JMwk4,"About your final comments on liberal democraty, an obvious religion in USA. We need to question the defence of the spectacle democracy where the true decision-makers (when they decide on something) are only puppets of rating agencies and big lobbies. When real issues arise, it is crazy how a liberal democracy can free itself from democratic rules by injecting millions when it‚Äôs time to make prevailing the viewpoint of the oligarchy. So, imagine the creativity of such regimes when we face even more important issues like climate change.

Excuse me for heresy, but we need to question the solidity of the temple columns, especially when we see the ineffective forms that liberal democracies can take. Provocative, J√∏rgen Randers  declared in 2012 at the Smithsonian Institute, celebrating in Washington the 40th anniversary of the book ""The Limits to Growth"" (he's one of the writers), that the American political regime, whose CEOs remain enslaved to the quarterly results of their corporations and political actors hampered by election results every two years, was unable to face the challenges of the century, as it was unable to implement the policies required without seeing them defeated by the electoral alternations game, but that the Chinese political regime was capable of doing so, as it was capable of planning over a long enough period. Should we conclude, despite its authoritarian nature, that such a meritocratic system (reintroduced in 1991 as a resurgence of the mandarinate under the CCP) would prove more effective in meeting the challenges of this century? At least we need to ask the question. This is what Daniel A. Bell  tried in a book co-written with Wang Pei without providing a clear answer, as if it was hiding somewhere between these two forms of governance. May be some should read ""The New China Playbook - Beyond socialism and capitalism"" by Keyu Jin to improve their judgement.

Sorry, but I don't share your vision of the world, which boils down to that of an American puritanism, whether it is mired in religious bigotry or that coming from so-called ""liberal"" circles.  It is defined by the supremacism that Americans place on their values and attitudes toward other cultures. He is profoundly individualistic, advocating individual success as a virtue and balking at the enunciation of collective rights. He thinks he has invented democracy, when in fact it is only a plutocracy where the rules defining it are worse than those of a banana republic: Generalized ""gerrymandering"" where the boundaries of electoral districts are established by the elected representatives themselves according to the areas where they receive the most votes. Some take bizarre forms. A practice worthy of the worst diets on the planet. The electoral enumeration entrusted to private firms that ""forget"" to enumerate whole sections of the population discriminating against them in a partisan manner. The distribution of polling places, some of which are up to hundreds of kilometres away from the voters they are to serve.""Voting machines"" of all kinds, provided by private companies in the pay of elected officials, making it even more difficult to carry out real control. The distribution of 2 senators per state, so that Wyoming with a population of 563,626 in 2010 can elect as many senators as California with nearly 40,000,000 inhabitants. The ""grand electors"", a regime imposed by the ""founding fathers"" to screen the expected excesses of the ""populace"". But above all, a democratic system where it is the billionaires who make the law through the unrestricted financing of electoral campaigns, making elected officials their only emissaries, according to the well-known adage: ""tell me who pays you, I will tell you who you belong to"". The United States is therefore far from being a model. Rather, it is a caricature of a true democracy. Seen from this side of the border (Qu√©bec, Canada), YES, it is a system unworthy of a neighbour that claims to be exemplary in terms of democracy

In this sense, several countries formerly described as ""banana republics"", such as Costa Rica, have adopted much more democratic electoral systems.

I come to find more quality in the Chinese tradition of meritocracy that has allowed the Middle Kingdom to sustain itself for more than two millennia and which, according to many observers, was reinstituted after the end of Maoism. China is much better equipped with competent leaders to set long-term goals to meet the challenges posed by climate, ecological and energy drift, while in the U.S. politicians don't think beyond elections and CEOs think about their quarterly returns... And even when the next administration doesn't tear up the treaties that the previous one had signed or the programs put in place aren't butchered to serve the private interests of billionaires sharing the butter pie.

I guess the funny part is: you don't even really need to understand or know what you are proving. 

The math does itself, you just gotta look at the results and then try to figure out what the math was before it did what it did. 

Of course nature has the final word on being the best model for... Itself. 
But I don't really understand your approach here to downplaying mathematics in terms of it's ability to describe nature. 

It is eerily effective at describing it. 
To the point where you get genuinely amazed by it over and over again the deeper you go into studying these things. 

Hell, Dirac (iirc) discovered anti-matter by correctly interpreting that a square root solution must be positive AND negative. 
The correct mathematical notation of a square root is the symbol with a + - symbol infront of it. 

Since two negatives times each other equal a positive. 

So he discovered anti-matter, before the experimentational discovery of anti-matter (as in, where they understood what it was), without even really knowing what it was except for expecting an opposite charge. 

In a sense, the mathematics he was doing was more accurate than he intended. 
It was *better* at describing reality than anyone expected in that specific case. 

It showed the existence of anti-matter before we discovered the existence of anti-matter. 
And all because of a rather abstract and generally not very important mathematical fact about square root operations. LOL.

So I'm sorry but I genuinely think you are underestimating mathematics. 
Particularly, although this is personal opinion, I think you're extremely mistaken about mathematics in the sense that we're the ones making it up. 
We're making up the symbols, we're making up some axioms and trying others just in case, and so on. 

Our math isn't perfect either, not even close. There are some problems we simply don't have the tools for. (3n+1), Riemann, ... 

But see that's the thing though. Nature's mathematics, so a theory of everything, IS PERFECT. 
It cannot be anything but perfectly mathematical. 

If there are any faults in mathematics, then it lies within OUR interpretation of it. 
Because the right answers are there to find. The problem is we need the correct tools. And it's very easy to use a wrong tool.",2024-04-05T23:25:18Z

..So would you say -- and this is only ""coincidentally"" related to your example -- that for example the discovery of the possibility of the square root of negative (-) numbers and how it has given us a framework for real-world application in electricity, engineering, fractals, etc, could be an interpretation of math/nature that is eerie to us humans because it's true nature may be potentially beyond the scope of human interpretation even though we can still leverage it in practical ways?

2024-04-13T02:33:23Z,@glenndewulf4843,gZZan4JMwk4,"As someone who does mathematics as a hobby (although kinda passionately so), my personal opinion is that there is absolutely something ""eerie"" or ""freaky"" about mathematics. Or at least certain concepts within it that reveal something. 

Like for example 1/3 = 0.333...
2/3 = 0.666...
3/3 = 0.999... = 1. 

Like this is the most simple example I can think of and I often bring it up... 

If you are thinking about this deeply and you don't find it freaky, I don't think you understand it. Maybe I don't either, but I must've gone deep enough to feel the freaky. Hahah. 

I love this one because it's kinda like a limit in math without being an actual limit. 
An infinitesimally small number so close to zero that it equals zero. 

Or an infinitesimally-close-to-1-number, which is so close to 1 that it equals it. 

You can surely claim more advanced knowledge, I'll concede it. 
You can go into depth and explain this all you want. 

But man, isn't this freaky? Something freaky going on there. 

And this isn't even remotely chaos theory or all that stuff. This is just division and multiplication of fractions, and already we can run into things we don't *really* understand (I think).

Many real researches showed already that AI in education will require more teachers per student for students to effectively convert the knowledges from AI to their own creative actions and experiences. This means that expensive private schools will have easily all they need for the quality education whereas public schools with ever decreasing budget will be forced to rely more on AI technology with inherent structural dangers of filter bubble and miss-information. So use of AI tech in education will mark a even more clear cleavage between high-quality private education and low quality public education system.,2023-05-28T17:25:01Z

But be careful of AI, for it knows only things of the flesh which are our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as true love and eternal joy that comes from obeying God's Word. Man is a spirit and has a soul but lives in a body which is flesh. When you go to bed it is the flesh that sleeps, but your spirit never sleeps and that is why you have dreams, unless you have died in peace physically. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart. When I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'. But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons those are things of the flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. However, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith - in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever. To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God's Word the standard for your life, not AI. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove text can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.

*HOW TO MAKE GOD'S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?*
You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love you have for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, ""You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men."" Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (Matthew 5:8). No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth - ""But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed"", Isaiah 53:5. Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart's desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying 'Thank you, Jesus...' over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven't let go of offence and past hurts. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don't worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), ""Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride..."" The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation. 

*THE BATTLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS (GOOD AND EVIL)*
Heaven is God's throne and the dwelling place for God's angels and the saints. Hell was meant for the devil (satan) and the fallen angels. Those who torture the souls in hell are demons (unclean spirits). Man's spirit is a free moral agent. You can either yield yourself to God or to the devil because God has given us discretion. If one thinks he possesses only his own spirit, he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark. God is light while the devil is darkness. Light (Holy Spirit) and darkness (evil spirit) cannot stay together in a man's body. God is Love (Love is light) and where there is no love is hell, just as where there is no light is darkness. The one you yield yourself to, you will get his reward. The reward of righteousness to man's spirit is life (abundant life) and the reward of sin to man's spirit is death. Sin and satan are one and the same. Whatever sin can cause, satan also can cause. Sin is what gives the devil dominion or power over man's spirit. When God's Word becomes a part of you, sin power over you is broken, you become the righteousness of God through Christ Jesus. Where Jesus is, you are and when He went (to the Father), you went. In the book of John 8:42-47, Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúIf God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of God hears God‚Äôs words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.‚Äù May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts. Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit. Watch and pray!... Thank you for your time and may God bless you as you share this message with others.",2023-12-23T11:21:26Z

2023-12-19T07:47:54Z,@brytonkalyi277,9BSCzWWCbFI,"\‚àÜ/ I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it knows only things of the flesh which are our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as true love and eternal joy that comes from obeying God's Word. Man is a spirit and has a soul but lives in a body which is flesh. When you go to bed it is the flesh that sleeps, but your spirit never sleeps and that is why you have dreams, unless you have died in peace physically. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart. When I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'. But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons those are things of the flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. However, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith - in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever. To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God's Word the standard for your life, not AI. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove text can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.

*HOW TO MAKE GOD'S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?*
You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, ""You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men."" Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth - ""But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed"", Isaiah 53:5. Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart's desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying 'Thank you, Jesus...' over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven't let go of offence and past hurts. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don't worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), ""Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride..."" The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation. Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit. Let us watch and pray... Thank you for your time.",2023-12-19T07:47:54Z

It even included a nice strawman against Libertarians.
Humans fundamentally don't like doing repetitive tasks. Its why factory work is unpopular. To address this, we created automation in the factory. This increased the productivity of one worker, increased the quality of the end product, and reduced the monotony of the work.
AI right now lacks any creative capacity. It may be able to collage what someone inputs, but it can't come up with its own ideas. When we think about AI like this, then it's more a productivity tool for a workforce that has largely not had productivity gains over the last several decades. If I used Visual Studio CoPilot, I could program ten or more times faster and produce better code. But it's not like AI will know what the entire software is until a person tells it what it is. It reduces the need for coders to rewrite the same code for different clients. This extends into other fields like finance and media art.
With that said, AI means less workers needed within those fields but a higher compensation for those who remain. Right now, the country is grossly lacking in manual labor and many in manual labor fields make salaries competitive with tech workers.",2023-12-19T02:33:06Z

I love that you‚Äôre getting your kids into coding at any early age so they‚Äôre thinking about it. 

The current state of AI in programming is that it can do known tasks pretty well, but it‚Äôs not very good at knowing what needs to be done at a macro level. 

So my workflow these days is giving it a number of tasks to complete, then reading through the code that‚Äôs produced and testing it. 

It‚Äôs definitely not at a point where it‚Äôs able to orchestrate an entire application on its own, despite that groups are marketing it as such.

The chance of China, BRICS and its members is impossible with the idea of the entire monetary union or even in the idea of cash they will inevitably be the loser Their chance lies in the largest labor energy in the world which will attract others and will be accepted and welcomed and loved by all societies of the world including the West and America
India, China and Latin America, with their population size and the immensity of Russia's resources, and other members will open up prospects for them with something else that will change the economy and the world forever.
The biggest benefit of AI capabilities is not war but economics by digitally calculating the value of work as a medium of exchange placed in the balance of the value maker instead of digital currency and real currency
In my opinion we need to get rid of the idea of criticism
Always diabolical dualism with criticism in general as a means of regulating exchange, inflation and overcrowding, it is always clear that a reasonable degree of socio-economic justice has become everyone's conviction that it is impossible, socialism has failed to solve it, taxes have failed to solve it, unions have failed, neoliberal economics have failed to obtain it, and we say a reasonable degree, at least, as did Keynes and the undisciplined money ogres who manipulate the authorities, law-making, tax haven paradises, fraud.......
They have become overlapping states, so here I come back and ask my question, does it carry the prospects of the solution to return to value, not cash and securities?
The greatest benefit to the capabilities of artificial intelligence is not war but economics by calculating the value of work digitally as a medium of exchange placed in the balance of the value maker instead of digital currency and real currency
This is an opportunity, perhaps, for the powers that want to get rid of the dollar, such as China, Russia, and even Europe, or for promising emerging powers such as India, or technologically advanced powers such as Taiwan, Japan, or South Korea, and I focus on India first and then China, because it is their invaluable opportunity.
Unless America precedes everyone and does this trick, and it is the strongest of all, depending on the degree of its pragmatism, the loss of the SWIFT system and the dominance of the dollar is a very difficult step
The best way to get rid of the curse of currencies, including the dollar, disasters, collapses, the monopoly of financial ghouls, crises and wars Scientific and technical development in general opens up horizons that did not exist in areas that no one has touched on before, it develops work and elevates it My humble opinion is that the economic system and the mechanisms of its employment and directing this development and the speed of its response to it is the key I want to repeat my presentation under my main name on the site of civilized dialogue and its foundations The best benefit we can get through artificial intelligence To calculate the value through a single measurement, scientists know the value just like the units of measurement in the ISO system such as meters, joules, watts, pascals, volts, amperes, newtons, kilograms, bits..... And blockchain technology to manage its circulation and get rid of the concept of currency to get rid of the currency curse
The idea of expressing value without currency proposed by Marx and Robert Owen Marx's idea was theoretical and mathematical, but Owen's idea was more practical with what he called units of measurement of work, but they had practical difficulty calculating it. I searched a lot for who studied value, and I came up with the idea of measuring value with a single measure that economists know, and we use artificial intelligence to calculate and manage it with blockchain technology used by electronic currency designers. This scientific aspect we owe to its creators, but of course we don't want it for digital currency because it is a new monopolistic tool that we want to share its value. I did not know that Marx and Owen had actually proposed the idea until after reading this by chance that this encourages us to lay a foundation from which to proceed, starting with the idea of this single criterion of the value of work for Owen and Marx, and then developing or modifying it according to the results of studies.
Value in one way is a measured measured by neural networks and fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence through dynamic weighting and adjustment processes that can enter social values, the amount of need, the degree of interest, creativity, energy and effort.......
Yes, we can calculate the value thanks to this technological development, unlike in the era of Marx and Owen. We can position it as a clearly defined tool. We call it, for example, WorkCoin or ValueCoin .....

Now, I  was just personally interested, I'm retired, and I'm not looking to get back in to work. I don't know if my brain is wired to ""get it"" when it comes to understanding coding. My career was in high-tech, oddly enough, and I worked with a lot of LINUX/UNIX systems, used regular expressions, etc. But it was more from the systems were vendor provided/supported, and we were the in-house ""technicians"" that handled software upgrades, module replacements, outage recoveries, etc., it wasn't writing code or anything ...",2023-11-26T15:10:52Z

The best way to learn is to build something useful or fun because then you learn stuff that you really need to learn at that moment to complete the next step.

2023-12-22T08:42:45Z,@aev6075,aN3-Yp_28rM,"Learning by just doing ""monkey see, monkey do"" is hard and I certainly can't do it. I often take multiple breaks and apply the Feynman method between learning sessions (Should be first thing to pop up if you google it).

When you have followed a piece of video and you've gathered some new information, then try to apply it. Don't be afraid of breaking anything, you can always reload the whole thing. ""What happens if I change this 10 to 100? What happens if I call this method instead of that method"". I find this to really solidify the idea in my head what these things actually do instead of plowing towards the conclusion the video has in store.

I also take notes. Lots and lots of notes during lectures. Instead of just watching how the lecturer imports some library, I insist on knowing what the general purpose of that library is. Also, gather extra information by just writing it in google. It really changes a line of code to something bigger and more easily understandable.

Instead of following a line of code like ""import torch"", check from google what that means. There's often documentations available on internet about languages and their libraries (of varying quality, torch documentation is great).

The flood of information is ridiculous at first, it's like trying to drink from fire post, but you don't have to read and know everything about everything right away, It's well enough that you understand the broad idea of something you are using and what it's useful for. For instance, you don't have to know everything about cars, it's enough that you know what they are useful for. If you have to modify or alter the car in some way, then it's perhaps better to gain more knowledge on the subject.

The data AI is currently working with is highly semantic internet data, resulting from very specific human behaviour and therefore most valuable in its use, as it reflects patterns (meaning). As the video states, we are now looking at the less valuable data like pizza production errors where not enough concrete human input exists/is hard to manufacture and so coding for it does not make much commercial sense. 

AI has no inherent ability to develop patterns in data, it just aggregates existing human patterns at scale.

The way i see it we are moving up layers of abstractions. Back in the day we wrote assembly code, than low level languages like fortran moved on to high level languages like python, now the next step is natural language ( specifying what you want to code in natural langauge to a language model) but you still need to be specific and there is no system level thinking really so basically good for writing functions. The one after that is loosely describing the functionality of a programm.... then describing funcionalities of systems and eventually entire products, apps and some AI will build it, or a version of it and you iterate with the ai until you are satisfied.

A programming language is a deterministic way to express a solution to a problem. Why you would want to replace it with something fundamentally not context free makes no sense. You have two options - write the code as your understand it and then test/profile/optimize. Or automate the easiest part of software development (coding) by prompting it and hoping it produces the right answer - and then try to test/profile/optimize a system you don't understand.

Programming is NOT about telling a machine what to do - that problem has long been solved by compilers. Programming is about expressing a solution to a problem in a deterministic way. Text is simply the easiest way to express logic and unless you want to have no idea what your system does - it will never go away.

There is this false perception that programming is about writing instructions - and therefore an AI allows you to translate a human level language to machine instructions. No. Programming is about problem solving and the issue of translating human level logic to machine code (compiler) was already solved by people far smarter than you 3 decades ago.

All these opinions about AI replacing software engineers are about people who don't work in this industry or think web development/scripting counts as software engineering (it doesn't).",2023-12-08T04:42:29Z

It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

2023-11-21T17:14:18Z,@connorskudlarek8598,aN3-Yp_28rM,"@@hikemalliday6007 the VAST majority of Senior developers do not think AI is going to take all the jobs any time soon. It is really only Junior devs that think this is the case.

Which, if you think about it, makes sense. A Junior dev doesn't know much yet and been in the thick of it in development. They get handed tasks like ""there is a bug on this page that moves the comment box out of alignment on mobile devices‚Äîre-center it on mobile devices without affecting desktop viewing."" And that sort of bug is something that can be done pretty slowly by a Junior, possibly fairly quickly by AI, and super fast by a Senior dev.

But what people forget is that a Senior dev can't be bothered to realign a comment box on mobile devices. An office drone wouldn't know how to take ChatGPT's output and put it into the test environment without themselves becoming a Junior dev (though without any programming knowledge). So either the Senior dev has to now do the task, or they're going to need to train the office drone to the competency of a Junior dev who doesn't know how to program anything themselves.

The point of a Junior dev is to push that task to them. The Senior dev is trying to figure out how to stop the database from crashing when the user numbers spike 200% at intermittent intervals throughout the day, without needing to run the server at maximum all day long that would cost the company $20k/month.

Those tasks that get pushed to the Junior is how they become a Senior, so they can replace the current Senior and solve those $20k/month challenges. And the Senior dev needs to be replaced so they can move on to Architect or Tech Lead and identify changes to save $35k/month.

There is a huge shortage of Seniors right now, and the Seniors see absolutely no reason to believe AI is going to take their jobs. Eventually, companies will have to settle and hire more Juniors again. The companies who tried to replace 2 juniors with 1 junior and ChatGPT are going to find themselves in hot water when they need 2 Seniors and only have 1 Junior to promote.",2024-04-18T02:20:36Z

From driving a truck to operating a bulldozer is not an evolution. It's just a lateral switch in trade. Bulldozer did not replace the need for trucks as a bulldozer was not invented to solve the problem that a truck has. Both bulldozers and trucks still widely exists.
