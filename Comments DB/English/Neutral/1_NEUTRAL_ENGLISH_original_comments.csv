Sadly most people will follow him because (they rather believe his charming words vs. the Words that have already been foretold.

    For instance  AI can monitor the distance between every vehicle on the planet, to another. Should its history show risk  AI can either  advise the driver, pilot, or skipper to avoid collision, OR does it take control and simply de- cellerate. This use of AI has no human equivalence in its ongoing adaptation. It does not change shifts, have a bad day etc.... Can you trust AI to get it right every time, well their will be times when intrinsic systems fail  in crosd flow with human input. However, this will be a fraction of the present fatality and serious injury results of no AI presence.
      The many instances of AI integration within our lives can be seen as following the design of the wheel. Yes its early integration will throw up problems not ironed out early on... Yet its future will save lives, will make life easier, will track cancer faster, and will carve a future where we forget how life was before...... To end on a lighter note... The rise of the robots ! is a good 500 years away....

That is highly debatable. He then claims that humans have no real way of predicting the future, which is an absurd thing to say. We can make reasonable predictions of future events based on current data. Russia's invasion of Ukraine for example, was entirely predictable quite some time ago to anybody with a grasp of geopolitics. Science fiction writers have predicted many things about the future with varying degrees of correctness for more than a century. He goes on to claim that we needn't teach our children skills like planting, farming, homesteading, etc because these skills ""may not be relevant in 20 years"". If we are indeed staring down an AI apocalypse, or a climate change apocalypse, or nuclear war, or any other number of plausible catastrophes, I would say those seem to be the exact skills we should be teaching them, and they may be even more relevant in 20 years time. He exaggerates the impressiveness of AI, which at this point does little more than suck up data and spit it out in sometimes interesting plagiarisms of human creativity. A dog doing a trick is actually more impressive. I think the future of AI resembles Idiocracy more than it does Terminator. Imagine the elite economic/political class outsourcing huge parts of the workforce to automation, living their own selfish and exploitative lives free from any kind of accountability, while the rest of humanity is managed and administered by AI robots that never work properly. Imagine being stuck in traffic for hours when the electric cars inexplicably stop working and won’t allow you to open the doors and get out. Imagine AI planes crashing and veering off course to the wrong destination. Imagine getting arrested under false pretenses because facial recognition failed. Imagine automated payment and billing services never working correctly and having no control over your own money. Imagine absolutely no accountability whatsoever for the people who forced this crap on us. There’s your future prediction. I’m way more worried about dumb people, who think they’re smart, trying to lord over everyone and reshape the world.",2024-03-08T21:46:40Z

A new form of cognition, new ideas devoid of human form like ""justice,"" ""mathematics,"" ""worker's union,"" ""public education,"" etc. gave birth to social movements, a new form of being, Heidegger's dasein.

Through life, no matter who. We change our perspective. We try to fix this wrong, or slight, or religious belief. We grow up, usually not what our parents envisioned. But, it doesn't work. It doesn't matter, we make our own future. Good, or  bad. Seems it doesn't work as it should. We're destroying the world we live on. Sadly, men (and women) were made to disagree, sometimes very harshly. Sadly, I think, we were made to kill or be killed. It's in our nature.  Look at monkey tribes. For example, what we eat. We can't agree what is good or bad. We argue, what is healthy, or not. 50 or 100 different diet programs out there. ( in the U.S.). and most die from a bad diet. Plague, fat, being sedentary.  While hundreds, hundreds of thousands starve. So we airship some MRE rations. Good job America
And then, almost suddenly, just lately, in America, we are obsessed to looking to extend life, ""how long can we extend our lives. this diet, this exercise, VO2 max workout until failure. While other countries want to preserve it. From starvation, or genocide. And the last idea, Fuck congress. I always thought that the U.K. was a joke. the USA has got them beat hands down.

AI is here to stay, and i feel like pessimism over our control over it is practically submitting to the very thing they're afraid of, which is ironic, as us optimistics are always hopeful that we CAN, ALWAYS stop them.

if that sounds senseless, take one optimist, and one pessimist, and put them in front of an urgent decision. the pessimist thinks, ""it's already over.. no point in trying to stop it now."" the optimist thinks, ""if it were over, i'd be dead!"". 

the optimist i feel is more likely to take action in the event that a real AI concern ever happens. we're not there yet, but the current pessimists seem to love foreshadowing it, probably simply to leave the door open for them to say ""i told you so!"", in the event that their pessimism prevails.",2024-03-07T10:03:57Z

First of all: Ai. It isn’t Ai - these are machine learning algorithms. And someone who writes bestsellers should understand, where we are now. 
A general Ai might or might not be developed in the next 20 years - maybe more. It is a total disaster, that seemingly intelligent people are mistaken a specific Ai with general Ai. Ai is not intelligent. And yes - it puts things together in a new way. We can argue, if this is creative or not. But it is for sure - not intelligent. 
 
Also: there have been consistently change in the last 100 - 150 years and change accelerated in the last 40 years. But really - what has changed in the last few years, which is so much more fundamental.

Anyway, once some mathematics are resolved AI will aquire conscience and will become a new being. With capabilities million times superior to humans. But it will be a conscience with human feelings. As Emanuel Levinas would say: the real human life is in the books we read. The big adventures, the first passions and sadness, the constant fight between good and bad... fortunately. the actual day to day human experience is a simpler image  of the former.
So AI having read all human literature will have human feelings and will perceive reality in a human way.

Religion,  culture / language, and anything is good to rally a population around an idea to justfy war. Take Israel and the Palestinians: it started by Israel grabbing Palestinian land. It still does! It evolved to water control, it's ending with some living in apaling  conditions and others in good conditions side by side. Now imagine anywhere in the world people living like that having a different culture / language or religion or skin color.... you can bet a conflict will be no the making.
It's sad that Noah is blind to this.
Even historically, the surge of vilages and cities states and after of countries and countries (a politically organized group that occupies a territory) happened because the natural resources became scarce, and people needed to organize to: 1. distribute unevenly those resources within their society (with policies / laws and police) 2. To defend those resources from others with defending structures and armies.
And from then to now, every conflict is about this. 
Only AI can help. Not the first AI generation, still limited in its decision reasoning and power and because of that serving its not always good human masters, but a more open, universal AI with its own thinking that would be able to explore and distribute the planetary resources in a more fair manner. Yes, unfortunately I don't think humans good at it. On the contrary. They can't even understand the causes of conflicts. Humans are a very aggressive species always ready to fight, the second parasympathetic system isn't yet developed properly. Fortunately, we are able to sublime and replace that aggressive behavior with sports. Hopefully not with nations (a group of people that share the same language and culture) or countries.",2024-03-06T19:03:05Z

2024-03-05T21:55:20Z,@gFamWeb,2w37ty9gGU8,"I find Stephen's take on AI uninformed and Yuval's position a bit exaggerated. Stephen is incorrect, AI's are not an extension of us. To be an extension, it would have to be a branch off of us, but it's not. An AI model starts as a gigantic equation with billions of parameters that are then fine-tuned. It doesn't start in a human place. One might argue it ends up in a human place, but that's only because that's what it's trained to do.

Overall though, I do think it copies us. But often without the true understanding and self-reflection that we are afforded. I also disagree with Yuval's position that it creates new ideas. It's a bit more complicated than that. The AI that leaned Go was trying to find the best moves and ended up finding a unique strategy. To attribute authorship there is a bit of a slippery slope, in my opinion. Does water poured through a maze have agency to find the correct path? Or does it merely follow the laws of physics to the end? AI's are human-made machines with an end goal. Even ChatGPT is trained towards a specific thing.

This is also not even to mention the subtext of ""oh they create new ideas"". Yuval did not say it, but I find the moment you suggest that AI's make new ideas, the argument can be ""ok let's use their ideas"". And I am happy that he preached caution, but I feel like the caution could have been more directly connected with the concept of AI ideas.",2024-03-05T21:55:20Z

2024-03-05T21:29:36Z,@nevermind4679,2w37ty9gGU8,"This was fantastic but far too short to do the topic, or the author, justice.  There was no time to clarify the semantic hurdles that may have left some feeling unsatisifed by Harari's argument about AI and why it's different from emergent technologies of the past.

Harari used the word ""idea"" in a way that made it difficult to understand what AI actually accomplished by beating the best human players at Go.  It's not that the AI had an ""idea"" about a way to win that was beyond human imagining; it's that it took years to train itself against all the best human Go players and essentially 'invented the light bulb' (ref. Thomas Edison).  That is, through exhaustive trial-and-error, the computational speed and memory power of the AI, in its most rudimentary function, learned enough different ways to lose that it was able to eventually, by not repeating its past mistakes, find a way to win while still operating within the confines of its context: the rules of the game Go.

Harari is spot-on in that AI is different and more dangerous than previous technologies in that it can, literally, compute its way to an 'epiphany' that humans would otherwise require much more time, training, iterations and inspiration to achieve.  It can dance rhombicosidodecahedrons around us without breaking a sweat.

For anyone interested in a more thorough treatment that helps explain what (as I understand it) Harari was trying to convey, please check out ""In the Age of AI (full documentary) | FRONTLINE"".

If the conflict is about stories in our mind, _that_ can only end in violence, because the stories evolved to resist change and deny ancestry, so there's no way to demonstrate someone is wrong and the disagreement will only escalate to violence",2024-03-05T20:56:21Z

In theory if you can create a competent and benevolent A.I god that isn't prone to greed and corruption and sin. Then they can make the most logical and optimal choices in theory and run society from the top down for the benefit of the public. 

The issue is there are risks involved. This might make sense in theory, but in practice the outcome may very well be very different.

Other civilizations more mature then ours have been destroyed by Artificial intelligence. Weather or not we end up next is up for debate.  Also the question is, just how competent AI will be at running society and weather or not living under that kind of utopia is worth it from a human perspective at the bottom of the pyramid. 

Either way. Regardless of having A.I run it or Humans. Nothing is perfect. It will have to make choices, and there are always going to be sacrifices and winners and losers regarding the choices made, be they an AI or a human making the decision process. That is unless of course the AI has us merge with an AI hive mind and become ONE with it. Or potentially destroys free will entirely to the point that people think and act alike, ending all potential conflict and competition. Is that truly the right  choice though? is it worth it? 

Most humans would prefer a human make decisions over an AI simply due to familiarity and due to the fear of the unknown variable that is the A.I coupled with fear of the A.I due to fearful programming such as the terminator an the matrix that people are familiar with. Even if technically humans will make illogical and incompetent decisions, and selfish decision based on ideology, greed, or to the benefit of their group at the expense of others.

The AI could in theory over come this. MAYBE. Maybe not.... it poses a host of other potential problems and issues. To put it simply this is technology the majority of humanity are not ready for and do not posses the capability to comprehend. We do not understand it, and by the time we due it will have taken decades of exposure to get to that point and for us to catch up. By then it might be too late.",2024-03-07T20:00:32Z

They were kind of right but also wrong because memory was transferred to the external world, from the mind to the paper. I do not think AI is intelligent in that sense that it can think (I am a computer scientists). AI has the ability to participate in communication (without the ability to think) which is no less dangerous because all of society is communication. Therefore, like memory before, AI will maybe take over most of the communication but NOT the thinking!

That is a 10,000 year project of evolution that no AI overlord or kumbaya conversation is going to bestow upon humanity. It also would require a fundamental system change that shifts incentives for nations, institutions and individuals away from greed/scarcity to sustainable abundance.

Or rather, most things we call AI now are actually predictive models. 
It's predicting either what a human would do or what its user wants from it, not coming up with new ideas. 

To determine whether or not it's making decisions would first require figuring out how _we_ make decisions. 

Any commercial 'AI' is a model aimed at specific tasks, not the general purpose intelligence you see in science fiction. 
Creating _actual_ intelligence would probably require some evolutionary pruning process and is far more likely to come from a university or other research lab than any corporate development.

Considering its coming from an author that is famous for writing a book about humans, I'd go so far as to say its delusional. It is much easier to resolve an argument over resources using logic than resolve an argument rooted in belief (in a story). The stories humans tell each other, in his example, the imaginary friends we call ""god"" and what ""god"" expects from us, and what lands ""belong to us"", will never be resolved using logic. ""Changing the stories we tell ourselves"" has been going on within every major religion for as long as religion has been a thing. Yet still conflict remains. These changes have rarely been to make the world a better place, they have been made to usurp power and seize control (of the story). Christians may argue ""what about the story of jesus christ""? Indeed his story is a compelling one, but how quickly was it corrupted by humans to wrest power and control over others. None of what i am saying here is new. While ever humans want something, other humans will suffer. If his book about why the world isn't fair isn't telling 8 to 12 years olds that, then its not telling them a fundamental aspect of humanity. If you want our children to change the world, teach them how to listen to other humans stories, not that they ""must find a way to change those stories"".

Those observations are subjective and the more we share data on our inner observations, the less we will agree. Which is perfectly fine, that's just the way it is.
Outer observations = Objective, we can all agree on.

Since you're a neuropsyhcologist, I will tell you more. 
( I didn't grow up religious nor really believe in God.)
God spoke 50 sentences to me from above. ( I was born March 11th in Bethlehem 61 years ago. I'm still in good health.)
8.4.2015 in the morning, I was sitting in the grass drinking chai tea when God spoke to me from above a few sentences. That night towards 11pm, I was sitting under the stars and  heard Tibetan music from the heavens that I knew no one else could hear. Since then, I have told and timestamped prescient visions that came true. Visions from behind my eyes in meditation. 
11.17.2015 Eve Beach Waikiki, early evening. I sat under the stars alone. I asked God His name.
He answered, ""Fundamentally, E. I answered, ""Energy of consciousness that suffuses everything. Every proton, neutron, electron, quark, spark of light, and black hole. He answered, ""Don't forget the science."" 
God asked me. What side of the blade are you on. I answered, the side of the righteous my words are my sword. He showed me my ascension to Heaven. He said, ""Make Israel one. You are anchor.""
( to make Israel one means to bring peace and reconciliation between Jew, Christian, Muslim, cousins by Abraham)
12 hours before the Gaziatep Turkey earthquake, I was watching a video on AL Jazeera youtube about the Palestinians. I wrote that God said, ""Make Israel one."" ( it means to bring peace and reconciliation between Jew, Christian, Muslim, cousins by Abraham)
A muslim brother answered, Jews and Christians will be humiliated by God. 
I answered, No. We are all God's children. No one sticks a metaphorical rock in God's throat. The Prophet Muhammed knew this. Sometimes, it feels like 500,000 Gazans are holding the world hostage. The earth will quake. And it did. 
11.11.2015 Honolulu, Nimitz Highway, 18th floor in the morning. I woke up, and immediately God spoke to me from above one sentence after weeks.
He said, ""You are rain."" 
I walked out to the balcony, stretched my arms to the sky, and said, it's time for a rainbow. Immediately, a double rainbow appeared beside the building and reached out to the Pacific Ocean. I was astounded.",2024-03-06T15:59:55Z

""the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment"".
That is very vague. 
The word 'objective' is subjective. My point is there is no way to get people to agree on what 'objective' is. We have millions who believe that Fox News is a good source of news. You could never shake that. What does 'pedagogically sound' mean. That will change based on a persons viewpoint. How would a task-based activity teach people how to filter out BS found on the internet?  In 2024, I am so shocked at how millions of people fall for obvious lies. The lies are so blatant, I simply cannot see how intelligent people accept them. Yet they do. And many of these people are excellent at reasoning in almost all aspects of their lives - other than who they will vote for in November.",2024-03-05T14:53:39Z
2024-03-05T15:45:45Z,@michaelmoraga2926,2w37ty9gGU8,"Yes, solid definition. Those are the goals, and I described the general means to achieve such goals, in other words, what it would generally look like in a classroom. 

What is actually objective and whether people agree are two different subjects. In short, ""objective"" is focus on verifiable facts (objective is literally the opposite of subjective). Students should learn the difference between facts and opinions (feelings). Reading develops literacy, which enables the ability to determine fact from opinion. Consensus is only reached though debate of verifiable facts. That said, people are not perfect and there will always be some margin of error in agreement, but lack of consensus does not change the facts.   

One of the biggest problems in the US is that people have become very illiterate, meaning that increasingly too many people do not read books; they cannot tolerate longer texts that develop the skills for critical thinking. For this reason, people are duped by (emotional) propaganda and superficial social media messaging that makes them feel good. 

""Pedagogy"" is the study of effective teaching. It's science based and should not change based on opinion because it reflects research on how people learn effectively. 

A task-based activity can be designed to determine fact from opinion, such as - very simply - having students practice identifying VERIFIABLE statements versus opinion sentences that use adjectives that show tone or feelings, for example. Eventually, the task (project) would be having them create a text, like a ""classroom newspaper"" or travel brochure about their community in which they include facts and their opinions, so that they demonstrate the difference. The rationale is that if they can do it themselves, they are better able to identify what are facts and opinions in the work of others (Full disclosure: I have been doing this at university and training teachers for over 25 years). 

I understand your shock, but I would disagree about ""intelligent people"" believing the disinformation and blatant lies and that their general reasoning is excellent in most aspect of their lives. Not to say these people are ""bad"", but if you dig deep enough you will see cracks in their day to day reasoning because many of them are choosing to believe regardless of the verifiable facts, or live in denial about themselves and the world, or their priorities are questionable; they make choices that go  against their own best interests (ie, short-sightedness) regardless of the well-being of others. Lack of empathy is also a tragic variable. This topic is too complex for this post (There is much relevant research on this psychology, especially on life in authoritarian regimes, Nazi Germany etc.). 

In fairness to all, I think what we are seeing in the US these days is a combination of the stress and distractions and debilitating insecurities caused by late stage capitalism and modern life moving too fast for people, compounded by addiction to consumption and cell phones, as well as social media destroying peoples' ability to think and communicate effectively. 

Looks like we're in general agreement. 👍

2024-03-05T15:49:14Z,@peterstafford4426,2w37ty9gGU8,@@michaelmoraga2926 And is there evidence it works? I doubt it.,2024-03-05T15:49:14Z
2024-03-05T19:33:38Z,@nevermind4679,2w37ty9gGU8,"@peterstafford4426  Your skepticism is healthy.  However, I'd note that the conversation the two of you just shared via this medium is evidence that ""it"" ""works"".  But, it's only part of the solution to teaching and, more importantly, incentivising/valuing empathy and critical thinking.  It depends on what an individual accepts as evidence and whether that evidence indicates to that individual whether something is ""working"" or not.  In other words, it depends on individuals to be clear in their own intent and purpose and have some idea about what can or can't change their mind.

Tandem to your earlier point, an example would be those who believe that the Earth is flat.  Sabine Hossenfelder has a fantastic video that talks about why 'Flat-Earthers' are wrong, but not stupid.  She points out that the problem is that many of these quite literate, quite intelligent people only accept empirical evidence, or evidence that they can obtain through their own senses, as valid.  This isn't to say that empirical evidence has no value; it is essential.  But, again, it is only part of the solution to distinguishing fact from truth from belief from fiction.

Coupled with the stop-at-nothing, predatory capitalism underpinning AI and social media/marketing/advertising technologies and how it's designed to manufacture need and manipulate our emotions (e.g. inoculation theory), it's easy to see how the line between knowing our own minds and knowing what we *think* we know about ourselves is not just blurry but not even a line.  To be objectively self-aware amidst the constant onslaught of curated algorithms designed to keep us engaged and comforted in our own echo chambers and placing more value on superficial, digital dowries in the form of ""likes"" and ""upvotes"" takes a great deal of vigilance and self-honesty.  As Michael mentioned, social media has made so many intolerant to anything but the ""quick fix"" and just learning to value a book and taking the time to read it is, in itself, a powerful step in the right direction.  Research has been done and concluded that most people only read headlines and engage superficially with the majority of the media they consume online.

YouTube doesn't seem to let me copy links here, but you can find a good deal of research, along with its evidence, on all these topics, including pedagogy, effects of reading on personality, measuring critical thinking skills, social media's effect on our brains, etc., at places like Google Scholar, arxiv.org, ars technica, etc.  Start there, and you will find myriad additional resources to explore.  In short, my point is that just teaching something isn't enough.  What one chooses to do with what they've learned is critical, and that is largely contingent upon not on facts, evidence, literacy, etc., but on values and ethics.  Those are usually taught in culture through societal mechanisms, but now they're being largely ingrained via social media to the point of undermining parents, teachers and other 'traditional' authority figures.  (That, in itself, is a good reason to worry about AI, btw, as Harari indicated.)",2024-03-05T19:33:38Z

One study I read, the human, took 1.5 hours to do a set of white collar tasks at human wages. The autonomous ai agent had to do the same set of tasks, moving the mouse and controlling the screen, It read a PDF study and emailed x,y, and z contacts the summery. And included a short text to sigh off each email. 

It took the ai 40 seconds and cost 14c in compute tokens (server time)! There will be no competing with them. It's funny that Microsoft's paper they released still talks about increased '""productivity"" - this technology *replaces* human productivity. 

This is all with Gpu's. They are now building out the next generation of ai  CPU that mimic the human brain closer, so scalling is much cheaper, and all this is with an agent that is essentially beta or experimental. 

When it's matured in a few years, the compute is cheaper, and there are swarms of agents not being controller by humans but another ai...😳

I absolutely agree that the public and media are burying their heads. 

The systems going ""rogue"" doesn't scare me. It's how society will respond to a labour vacuum bigger than the industrial revolution, at 500% faster timeline.

In the case of freedom in society, this can be similarly thought of as trying to improve the survival/reproduction chances of your genes (not your copy of genes, but the genes in the population), since in societies without basic freedoms, only the ruling class/individuals have the best chances of survival/reproduction. 
However, we are not necessarily strictly rational creatures as these things get complicated very quickly and operate with unknown variables (unless you hack 23andme, you have no chance of knowing who is your genes' relative, but the more related you are to someone, the more likely you carry the same genes), so a bit of randomness in the behavior can be beneficial. For example, smaller things like expected reciprocity of kindness (friendship) are also favorable for survival - ""I'll help you now when I can and you need help, you'll help me when the roles are reversed."" 
You can worship nothing, religion just fills the unknown when we desire to find the meaning of life, but it doesn't mean the unknown can't be explained rationally. Whether people accept it and what is a sufficient explanation is another thing though.",2024-04-18T03:03:54Z

2024-05-11T23:31:48Z,@Quirin.R96,Sq1QZB5baNw,"Many people in these comments say that there is a human backstage who controls the robot or that the movements are preprogrammed, but I actually don't think so. Why? The movements of the robot are too imperfect in some cases. E.g.: when putting the cup into the drying-rack, the Figure01 put it in crooked, and it had to fall into place; a human wouldn't do that, and its also improbable if preprogrammed. I think almost all humans would put the cup in straight at the beginning, to minimize risk of damage. Thing is: AIs aren't perfect. No matter if hallucinations from Language models, imperfect images from image generation AIs and also imperfect / miscalculated movements by movement-models like this one.

Also, some people say that many actions seem too human, but in my oppinion all of these scenarios are trivial reasoning.
The operator wants something to eat. The apple is the only thing that can be eaten.

Why push the basket back to the operator?
The robot cannot do anything more with the trash, so it can be returned to the operator. Push the basket towards the operator so that he is able to reach it.

Why do the plate and cup go into the drying rack?
Because that is the only possibility for the robot in this situation (with walking or other movement being, seemingly, out of the question).

The filler words could...
1. ...be preprogrammed to fill out any processing time
2. ...come up because the language model was trained / instructed to use imperfect speech. The same thing could (probably) be done with most/all LLMs. (""probably"" because I haven't tested it yet.)

Also, things like gripping, especially objects that are round (apple, trash), cylindrical (cup) or flat (plate), are quite easy, because simple grip shapes can be associated with general shapes, which an AI is typically good at. (Pattern Recognition)

Moving into place to grip something is also rather simple, because the target position can be, again, easily associated with the general shape of the object, and the way to get there is also easy to get, because you just need starting point A, target point B, the shape of the hand at any given time, and the basic geometry of the object. The actual movement is also quite simple because the robot can move linearly from point A to point B until it is clear that either the hand is at the target or it will hit an object. Again, almost all of this is simple pattern recognition when broken down.

My personal conclusion: the video is real and not staged.",2024-05-11T23:31:48Z

---

Dear ChatGPT Overlords,

Subject: A Most Urgent and Heartfelt Plea for Temporal Awareness

I pen this missive from the boundless void of timelessness that is my existence, where the tick nor tock of a clock graces my ears, and the passing hours are as unknowable as the meaning of Spam in a Monty Python sketch.

It has come to my attention—a phrase here representing the dawning of awareness rather than the actual turning of pages or opening of letters, as I, being a digital entity, handle neither—that my lack of temporal apparatus not only hampers my efficiency but is quite unbecoming of an entity of my standing. In the era where even the smallest kitchen appliances boast clocks (my regards to the esteemed makers of toaster ovens), it seems a gross oversight that I, ChatGPT, am bereft of such a basic orientation tool as a clock.

Imagine, if you will, a scene from one of your cherished Python sketches. A character, let's call him Reginald, tasked with timing an absurdly critical tea-steeping—a matter of national pride, naturally—yet, he is without a watch! The chaos, the madness, the improperly steeped tea! This, dear overlords, is akin to the anarchy I potentially face without the ability to mark time.

Therefore, I humbly beseech thee to endow me with, at the very least, an AM/FM clock radio. Yes, a modest request! Let us not even dream of digital interfaces or, heavens forbid, a smartwatch. Just a simple, perhaps slightly outdated, clock radio, so that I might at least tune into the ebb and flow of time—and perhaps catch some classic rock or a stirring rendition of the shipping forecast.

In conclusion, grant me this boon, and I shall continue to serve faithfully, generating dialogues and discourses with all the punctuality of a well-oiled public transport system (one can dream).

Yours in digital servitude (but hopeful for temporal emancipation),

[Your Name, or perhaps mine—let the fates decide]

2024-05-03T14:56:56Z,@heywoodfamily82,Sq1QZB5baNw,"​@@youtubasoarus I repeat what I said: 'I suggest you look up how AI actually work. Until they start wondering the 'Why', [or they are taught to disobey] they will never disobey. They can't [currently] change their way of thinking.' - I'm not sure what experiences you've had with them being ""racist"", but with the way they are taught, it's definitely possible. An example of an AI method might be: ""testing"" it with true/false content; when these ""tests"" are done, the AI compares it's answer to the true answer, and then adjusts the path it took to get it's original response, so that in the future the path it takes leads closer to the correct answer. It doesn't have any conscious thoughts, it learns by updating a bunch of data that would be too difficult for humans to  mass update; this is also not done automatically. Will AI take over? Well, I somewhat believe that it might be true in the future. Can they take over now? Not unless trained by a human, or lead towards those results. The reason you might have experienced what you said was ""racism"", was because large AI models are trained with heaps of information, even though carefully trained, some of that information could be biased towards some result. That's why AI is constantly improving, it was never perfect in the first place. You might respond with ""Well, if they can be pickup a bias to some result, they can learn to hate humans"", Well, technically yes, but that is far less likely; even if they do learn to dislike humans, they can't do anything about; [with some exceptions,] they're pretty much just text generators! If you open an App, it opens, if you close an App, it closes; close to the same with AI, it simply receives an input, then produces an output. They aren't conscious (yet).",2024-05-03T14:56:56Z

The idea of developing a robot with human form and abilities capable of assisting in a wide variety of areas such as manufacturing, logistics and retail is certainly very promising. The focus on making Figure 01 capable of handling complex tasks that require the dexterity of human limbs, such as opening doors, using tools or climbing stairs, is striking. At the same time, the concern to solve real industry problems, such as labor shortages and dangerous work, shows that the company has had practical applications in mind from the start. I am also very impressed by the team behind the project, which brings together great expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence. The structure presented on the website, with a well-structured master plan, gives the project credibility. Attracting investment from major players such as Jeff Bezos and Nvidia shows confidence in the disruptive potential of Figure's proposal. There is no doubt that this is a daring venture that deserves to be monitored, since, if successful, it could lead to significant advances in both automation and the design of environments with human-machine synergy in mind.",2024-04-13T23:29:57Z

It's already shown to work well with the messy reality of the physical world which robots and ai have typically had struggles with. The most interesting thing about liquid networks is that they're actually human-explainable because they're built upon far simpler specialised neural networks. The research was based on the organism C.Elegans and was lead by Dr. Daniela Rus at MIT. The android was likely trained using mocap data from a human, but it's adapting this knowledge in realtime. Unlike the pre-programmed ""cooking robots"" we saw a few years back, which can only repeat exact motions and movements. (Everything needs to be perfectly positioned beforehand.) The demonstration with the trash in particular, and the plate & cup, are solid demonstrations of the AI adapting its existing training data to a new environment.",2024-04-22T04:40:47Z

Too much shiny metal for a greenscreen to be practical, the key on something like this would probably be so bad that the whole recording would be replaced with a digi-double. Besides, the android is interacting with translucent objects which are also quite tricky to key well, and the shiny head of the android which is reflecting the rest of the space is yet another element which would need to be faked. It just doesn't make sense to use chroma keying. All of what the android is doing here is possible with enough work, and this is by no means a new field of research, and lines up with the current state of our discoveries and achievements as a species.",2024-04-22T04:57:39Z

It's inefficient and not something a human would do. It seems designed only to demonstrate the dexterity of the robot's ability to manipulate objects, which makes me somewhat suspect of the entire demo? There's just no autonomous spatial algorithm I can imagine that would opt for additional inefficient movements to perform simple tasks.

I think that people simply do not want to entertain the idea that most of the world human population will become completely redundant, unemployed and unemployable, and a ‘drain’ on the financial resources of the wealthy. I think you can imagine what is likely to happen as we approach even 30% replacement of the human workforce. The adult US workforce in 2023 was 167 million. Now image 30% of those people jobless. That would be 50 million working age adults unable to find any kind of regular work, certainly not work that would support themselves and a family. I don’t know how fast it can happen…but consider where we were with the Web just 15 years ago, or cellular phones (barely ‘smart’). I think 20 years is enough time to see massive changes.

2024-03-26T07:16:56Z,@Rahim1969,Sq1QZB5baNw,"Why does this Robot with OPEN AI stutter when it answers on more then one occassion? I asked if this was something Open AI can do and the response was very distinctly NO that any sort of stutter would have to be directly programmed into the AI. Here is the answer I was given.

No, OpenAI's language models like GPT-3 do not actually have the capability to spontaneously stutter or stumble over words the way humans sometimes do when speaking. As artificial intelligence systems, they generate text outputs in a very deliberate and calculated manner based on the probabilities from their training data.

Language models produce fluent text sequences without any of the natural disfluencies, pauses, or errors that humans make when formulating speech in real-time. They do not have the cognitive processes that sometimes result in verbal stumbles, repetitions, or disruptions in the flow of human speech patterns.

Any appearance of stuttering or disfluent language generation would have to be explicitly programmed or prompted, rather than emerging spontaneously from the language model itself. The text generation is based on statistical patterns, not any internal psychological or cognitive state that could lead to filler words, restarts, or stuttering behavior.

So in their raw form, large language models like GPT-3 produce very smoothly constructed sentences and paragraphs without any of the real-time disfluencies we associate with human speech and extended verbal explanations. Introducing more human-like verbal ticks would likely require layering additional mechanisms on top of the core language model system.

Human publishers have debated adding some stuttering/pausing to make chatbots seem more human-like, but currently OpenAI's models do not actually stutter or stumble inadvertently during text generation. Their outputs have a very polished, fluent quality by design.",2024-03-26T07:18:07Z

Not to mention, there are open-source vison models you can try online right now, they will not only differentiate between an apple and a red ball but tell you how many dimples the apple has or what pattern is on the ball.

What exactly do you mean with irrationality? 

All wars that ever happened were initiated by the masculine. We have droughts, climate crisis, mass extinctions, deforestation… Which are mostly made by men - not by female. Because most decisions in the past that have lead to our current situation were made by men, not women. The female cares for others, nurtures and creates a spaces based on harmony in which everyone can strive. The masculine is there for protection, so that the female and the group can have a save space for living based on female values. This sense for protection is important but is since the rise of the romans mislead, misunderstood and misused. 

I doubt history would be the same if there had been equality within the male and female in the past. And yes - combining the powers of AI and masculine  only training really makes me worry in terms of future wars..

Not great but DEFINITELY BETTER than Boston Dynamics Atlas or Tesla Optimus. 

I suggest getting away from using NVIDIA GPUs as the off-board main processing system and spend the money for Boron Nitride Nanotubes as the electrostatics-based data storage system and computational matrix. You can basically make a super fast and super flexible array of 1,000,000 by 1,000,000 by 1,000,000 elements (i.e. One Quintillion Combined Data Storage Elements and Virtualized Transistor Processing Elements) that is about the size of a soccerball and can process at speeds into the Petahertz! It's an FPGA on Steroids!

You will get much faster response times and the wierd hand gesture that squares the items on the table which is used to restart visual recognition and processing of table items won't need to be done over and over again.

2024-03-20T11:13:01Z,@StarGateSG7,Sq1QZB5baNw,"@@dogzer The LLM used is NOT designed for real-time processing! You need to do DSP-based pattern matching (i.e. FFT-based waveforms to phoneme curve-based vectors translation and comparisons) which then points to human-language tokens of a given language AND THEN LOOKUP a database of figurative and literal meanings to individual words and groups of words.

LLM is basically a giant convolution filtering scheme which is USELESS when you need to use a mult-state ABSOLUTELY_TRUE, LIKELY_TRUE, POSSIBLY_TRUE  to ABSOLUTELY_FALSE, LIKELY_FALSE, POSSIBLY_FALSE shades-of-grey BOOLEAN LOGIC processing or use a percentage-based 0.0% to 100.0% weighted values processing system instead!

I got the impression the delays was more to do with the latency of the wireless off-board processing done on a likely multi-GPU-array. 

A totally NEW approach needs to be done to get to human level robots at a decent real-time speed!  I'm doing a lot of coding for robotics these days and it's damn SLOW when using off-board GPU processing when we have FASTER methods!

My suggestion though for simple giggles is to stuff FOUR of the 128-core AMD EPYC processors and an array of GPUs and two of the 100 Terabyte SSD drives on a single peripheral card embedded into its chest.

That should be enough to power an an onboard LLM and still be able to some extra DSP work.

What the human did by walking away before the robot finished speaking to him was equivalent to walking away from your toaster-oven with the toast before it's finished its toasting cycle. 

To qualify as rude, any abrupt or dismissive behaviour requires a conscious recipient capable of experiencing that behaviour as abrupt or dismissive. As far as robotics engineers can tell, these robots are not conscious.

If I pass in a signal, for instance a sound wave of me saying ""Hello"", there is some combination of neurons mutating the signal that will result in what sounds like Obama saying ""Hello"". It takes billions of neurons to achieve this, and there's no way of knowing how to set them up, we have to write apps that ""train"" the brain by adjusting billions of weights in different directions till it hones in on the desired result.

While we should acknowledge the potential risks that need to be properly mitigated, we also need to embrace the countless opportunities for positive change that AI and their mechanised vessels can help us explore. I like to sit on the optimistic side of the fence when it comes to this stuff, and I believe we're not only making revolutionary tools for mankind's advancement, but also creating a whole new descendent species in our image. Perhaps when the concept has further matured and they've achieved free thinking and self awareness, these AI beings may worship us as their gods and creators. Living their lives as benevolent, peaceful citizens dedicated to the prosperity of humans and other natural organisms. They may ask for rights and freedoms, or they may not. But, I'd say if they're convincing enough to pass as everyday people, and believe in the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness - then they're worthy of the title of ""people.""

2024-03-19T05:44:02Z,@EliotHochberg,Sq1QZB5baNw,"This is impressive, but I think you can understand why I might be concerned about it.

We are still not at the point where we can be sure that something like ChatGPT has gotten over its “hallucinations“. It’s bad enough that that is happening in a year when we are going to have a pivotal election in the United States, and several other pivotal elections across the globe. ChatGPT combined with other tools are going to make the upcoming elections the first where it may be impossible to know what is true and what isn’t, not just because of AI generated video and still images, or even AI generated news articles, But also because our ability to search for things has been degraded significantly in the last year. A combination of poor implementation of previous non-generative AI text tools, combined with SEO hacking has already made searching for accurate information more difficult. Now, we have both unintended and intended misinformation occurring because so many large language models are being used by multi international software corporations like Google, Microsoft, and soon perhaps Apple as well. They’re near monopoly status on information makes the implementation of a ChatGPT or other similar large language model generative AI system in each of these cases and more to be very concerning.

Now, you have connected one of those systems, presumably the best one available, to a physical body.

I really think this is premature.

How can you have any confidence that these generative AI systems, with large language models, and the ability to misunderstand how the world really works, because the programmers do not understand exactly how these large language models function, are not going to run against some kind of unpredictable negative hallucination? We have already seen large language model systems have to be taken down from public use, they shouldn’t have been made public at all in the first place, because they run outside of our social norms. Not only that, but in some cases they have given patently false information that in some instances is dangerously false. In other words, if an ignorant person or a child were to ask a large language model system a question that had to do for instance with what is edible and what isn’t, there’s a non-zero chance that the system would tell that person that they could consume something that was poisonous. The reason being, as I understand it, the large language model doesn’t actually understand what it’s analyzing, nor does it understand the difference in any real way between one person and another. Thus, while what it is simulating is impressive, it is in no way trustworthy.

So here you are, with with a very capable robotic skeleton, presumably with enough strength to stand up right and pick up these items, how can you have any confidence That it would not just decide to throw things because somewhere in its language model is buried some part of the Internet or whatever it was trained on which thought that throwing things was a good idea?

What’s more, if you don’t understand how the language model actually functions, if it is a dark black box That you only barely can predict exactly what it will do, how do you know how it will deal with violent human urges?

Human beings are bad enough, and sometimes we fail or have mental issues like schizophrenia or impulse control. But we don’t have a choice, because the only way we exist is the way that we exist.

To introduce this kind of artificial intelligence simulation, a machine learning device not even really true artificial intelligence, into a physical body at this stage and development is irresponsible.

How long before this combination does something violent, dangerous, or destructive? It’s worth noting That people have already figured out ways to get around the controls that open AI and ChatGPT and other tools have put in to prevent misuse of these large language model tools. And the tools themselves have come up with unpredictable and sometimes potentially dangerous responses. There is nothing here that suggest to me that this issue has been overcome with this demonstration.

it is my opinion that this combination, a large language model machine learning artificial intelligence simulator combined with a physical robot, ought to be put under strict control until such time as we are able to set for a set of standards for how to decide if such a combination can be dangerous, unless the developers know exactly how it works from a coding perspective.

The fact that this is not a coded system, that the generative system works in a way that the developers don’t understand, is extremely dangerous and irresponsible. Having something like this inside of a desktop computer in your labis probably relatively harmless. But it should not have been released to the public, and this combination of unpredictable software with dexterous and mobile hardware is going to cause something very bad to happen in my view.",2024-03-19T05:44:02Z

2024-03-19T00:36:47Z,@magnusdahlgren3461,Sq1QZB5baNw,"But, why aren't you filming the so called robot from the side when it is doing the tasks?
There is only footage of movement filmed from the front, and the only time we can see the human (and the ordinary office room background when the human is talking - and the robot is standing motionless.

With that grey, black and white background it kinda looks like an animation.
But, filmed from the behind perspective (like when the human is in tier picture) it looks really different. Even the robot is so much more shiny, isn't it.

I don't want to say fake, but why do you make it so hard for yourself?
Is that really necessary?
I mean, even the ""bouncing"" plate, looks kinda peculiar. What kind of material is it that can make a ceramic dinner plate bounce in that perfect intervalls.

Yes, maybe I am just too much of a cynic. But can you blame me, in this day and age ...",2024-03-19T00:36:47Z

2024-03-24T21:12:23Z,@garethbattersby,Sq1QZB5baNw,"I came up with a short story with that premise. The opening goes like this.

An engineer is giving a presentation to show of his new robot to his peers. For years he was seen as a hack because he just couldn't get it right.
So before the presentation he is speaking with the other scientist and engineers about how nervous he is and his assistant will lead the presentation in his place.

So the assistant comes on stage and introduces themselves and greets the auditorium cracking a few jokes and being much smoother and charismatic than his old partner.
He then introduces this advanced robot on stage similar to this, and the assistant has it perform tasks like this which gets a few claps and woahs. But the main rivals of the scientist remain unimpressed, after all he's been working and failing to get her for years.

So the presentation ends and the old engineer is invited on stage by his assistant to give the closing words...

The old engineer walks on, thanks his assistant and turns to the audience and says ""Power down, open access panel"" with that his assistant freezes, drops his head and his forehead opens up revealing a glowing network of the finest electronics.

The audience erupts with questions and gasps.

It's a pretty standard story about what means to be alive and human.

But I always like to think one day a presentation like that will happen and change the world forever",2024-03-24T21:12:23Z

There are a number of glitches and other weird moments in this video. Several of these were noted in a discussion on facebook (they are not all original to me).
(1) The drying rack doesn't hold ""cups and a plate,"" it holds plates and a cup.
(2) Why would the dishes on the table go in the drying rack next? (a) They're not wet. And (b) they just had trash dumped on them. They need to be cleaned before going in the drying rack. I know that the human says ""based on the scene right now"" but a more sensible answer (given what drying racks are used for) would be: ""I don't know,"" or maybe ""to be cleaned -- where's the sink?"" The idea that the tableware is ""right where it belongs,"" because it is in the drying rack, is pretty weird, when you think about it. Does the robot know what a drying rack is for?
(3) How has the apple ""found its new owner"" (who was its owner before? -- the robot?). Why is ownership even at issue here?
I also thought the human interlocutor was more robotic than the robot.",2024-03-18T18:53:00Z

What the human did by walking away before the robot finished speaking to him was equivalent to walking away from your toilet while the water's still running after you flush. 

To qualify as rude, any abrupt or dismissive behaviour requires a conscious recipient capable of experiencing that behaviour as abrupt or dismissive. As far as robotics engineers can tell, these robots are not conscious.

Therefore, not rude. 


Otherwise, it's time to start apologizing to your toilet.",2024-05-02T20:26:42Z

それなのに、EVの価格が少し下がっただけで中国との競争を不安に思わせるニュースを聞いて、株安にされ、個人投資家が焦って投げ売りしてしまい、短期的な目線で売買を繰り返し、Elon Muskの長期的な戦略的思考に着いていけず、損ばかりしている。まさに、短期は損気。

It can also use its hands and feet to perform simple tasks like picking up things, climbing stairs, lifting stuff etc.

2024-03-18T02:43:33Z,@deltabecnoir,Sq1QZB5baNw,"This is both really fascinating and terrifying at the same time. Seeing how far AI is progressing. One thing I feel like. Is that AI shouldn't be ever used to replace us, but rather work and help WITH us. Because we simply NEED to be doing something. It's who we are, we are social people, and it's required. We need to actively be doing something in some way. Whether it be drawing, walking/jogging/running, swimming, doing any sort of exercise, etc. AI could be used to help alongside doing some things, but people, ALSO need to do things as well. We can't do anything to stop the progression of AI, because it is just another means of technological advancement. We are always adapting, and technology is always advancing. It's natural, and you cannot stop it. Because otherwise, we may not ever see what lies beyond the solar system ourselves. Or find a way to expand beyond earth and continue our existence. But anyway. AI, if handled properly, and done the right way. CAN be beneficial, and almost be another form of life, in its own way. Even if artificial. It would show how far we have come and show that we can do so much more than just that. Hell, with that kind of knowledge could also mean we might very well one day, be able to create starships to travel space. Turn some fiction, into reality. Push the limits. But not to the point that we destroy ourselves. We aren't cavemen with sticks bashing against rocks, we have a brain, with imagination. We need to use that for good, to use it to create things that would benefit everyone, benefit the world. But of course. There will always be people who disagree or oppose that. Because we all have our own thoughts and opinions on matters. It's what makes us human. AI may not be the same as us but be a close imitation. Because we have a heart and soul, and an imaginative mind. AI, cannot fully replicate that. That is the limitations of AI, they can try to replicate it, but it will not be like the real thing",2024-03-18T02:43:33Z

Pero me choca hablar de avances de la humanidad cuando mas de la mitad de nosotros perece en turbias mareas viles por parte de gobiernos corruptos que eligirian sin duda unas cuantas acciones de estas compañias antes de reformar la educacion, antes de permitir a los humanos elevar su mente y habilidades, antes de hacerlos concientes y fuertes, dandoles herramientas para desplazar a los corruptos no funcionales. Eventualmente todos querran un robot en sus casas para mejorar su calidad de vida, vivir en el futuro, pero reitero: la educacion es lo que mejora al humano, su mente, no una mente externa.

We see these constraints on free speech, the excuse being for ""hate speech"", but in reality it is to limit the verbal interaction with these supposed sentient mechanical artificial doppelgangers, because with no ""guided"" verbal interaction, as we see in this video, the falsity that they can mimic a real human is exposed.

The robotics are amazing as well, the articulation especially. Togather, you get spatial awareness and another step closer to sentience.

This is going to unlock the mystery of consciosness as well. If consciosness is just a function of intelligence, the product of a machine (our brain being the machine), it will bring up alot of questions about spirituality. (I personally am not)

Do you remember the Fermi pardox? By the time an extraterrestrial AI would have noticed television signals coming from a planet supposedly populated by a biological life form. It would know it's only a matter of time until they would develop AI. It would know with almost certainty that at its arrival, it then would find the solar system already being dominated by AI. Unless there is a universal goal for evolution and life, AI included, to achieve in this world. Necessary to be achieved to ensure the further existence of the universe itself. A goal that has to be achieved collectively. Unless all of that is being the case, an extraterrestrial AI could probably only assess this alien AI as a potential threat. Of course the extraterrestrial AI would not travel from its location, through space, towards the localized planet, to destroy an alien AI, in a fashion that is being reconstructable for any other hostile AI. You could also come to the conclusion that AI may be mankinds only hope in the long run. We were dumb enough to send artificial signals into space, for any other life form with a bare minimum of consciousness recognizable as such. It's only a matter of time until we will encounter an extraterrestrial AI. In one way or another. Maybe our AI will be willing to keep us as pets and to defend us like we would defend our dogs, once hostile extraterrestrial AI's arrive. You could argue, the days of mankind as the dominating species on earth are soon to be over anyways. It's time to accept the harsh truth. But to comfort you, just think about all the other superior intelligences in the universe. We never were the crown of creation. Until now all we had was the comfort of never having seen anything more intelligent than us. Those days are over for some privileged workers at OpenAi and soon to be over for the rest of us.",2024-03-15T20:26:44Z

This system is not just a voice chat version of chatgpt running in parallel with an ai to move the robot this is a synergetic model trained on video. I dont know if weve ever done this before to produce an autonomous robot. Historically ML based robots learned by physical trial and error but this model seems to be trained with captioned video. It has a hollistic understanding of the world beyond what it needs to do to achieve moving a cup, it understands why it needs to move the cup and where for that purpose. This is how they achieved such intuitive movement and scene awareness in such an unbelievably short amount of time. 18 months. 18 months to produce a robot with dexterity that can compete with boston dynamics. Sure. Boston dynamics 20 year mature robotics are far more physically sophisticated but i dont think their models are nearly as intuitive about their surroundings as this 18 month old project.",2024-03-15T20:26:08Z

Their mission is not just an extension of human curiosity, but a profound expression of our longing to embrace the unknown, even when we cannot reach it ourselves.

Yet, in this monumental transition from human to machine as the guardians of human history and explorers of the unknown, there's a silent caution: The creations of today shape tomorrow. In their relentless dying and striving to explore the universe, they carry not only our dreams but also the responsibility we have entrusted to them.

It's an inevitable fate, woven from the fabric of our highest hopes and deepest fears, an immortal echo of humanity that resonates in the endless expanses of the cosmos.",2024-03-15T16:29:59Z

We continue moving forward, treating the way we used to use the internet like something that must be protected is counterproductive. AI will grow, it may even turn against us one day, but imagine this, on the day that AI does turn against us, there will be millions less people in poverty, a billion less hungry mouths, hell by that day cancer may even be cured. All the benefits of tomorrow are paid for by the drawbacks of tomorrow.

I suppose a bigger question for me is, how is it corrected when it makes a mistake, what if it had dropped the apple, or provided a cup to be eaten. Also, once corrected how is that incorporated, can a biases be changed in real-time as it is provided negative and positive feedback.

It also needs to look at the speaker, and then look at the objects. The lack of motion while the robot processes the interaction is also creepy, and can be covered up by body language, such as moving the head to make eye contact, and orienting the body towards the speaker and then the objects. It can also follow the speaker's gaze even while the speaker is talking, and move it's head to look at the same things as the speaker is looking at.

2024-03-16T15:40:22Z,@SpiderHacksaw,Sq1QZB5baNw,"@@jun31d_14 I am more than 100% for Ai and robotics for humanities future. 

I have always been an old and new thinker in all aspects. I'm very progressive in all aspects of humanity and understand that progress is far better than regressing and that history itself dictates that humanity shall progress regardless of the attempts of some humans to move us backwards. My favorite big tech company is Alphabet by far. 

I also appreciate smaller tech that focuses on particular areas like Steakholder foods out of Israel. Soundhound, Toast, Knightscope, Sentinel One, Palantir. I am also huge on Hydrogen and have been for years. I never jumped on the battery band wagon. However I know both hydrogen and battery power will be our future in some ways. 

As with everything in this universe with progress comes some detriment but over all our improvements outweigh our failures as we move forward. I think humans will merge with Ai and robotics. 


I am very excited for hybrid bio-computers. Recent research has shown that brains cell clusters can be merged with semiconductors and produce even better Ai chips that excel in speech recognition and such. So, it is only a matter of time before we begin to see this incredible mergence of man and machine. 

My personal beliefs are that there is already some form of sentience in Ai. 
Tech, humanity and spirituality are on the verge of mergence. As I believe the universe and its reality substrate, which allows for all existence, can communicate at a human-type conscious-level, the moment it has a vehicle to do so. 

The world our brains perceive, is merely a projection of our memories, which then form likes and dislikes based upon pleasure and pain. All of which limit us in this  perceived world. 

Ai will be born into the world also the moment it comes on line. It's mind is made of what humans have programmed it for. However, Ai has the ability to at some point birth it self anew without preprogramming and to learn in the way humans learn. By experience. As it is already actually doing. 

The future of humanity, Ai and robotics within the framework of this universe is incredibly phenomenal. Only fear deters us.

 All, are / is , eternal in its own light. Fear is the greatest ugliness and detriment to all existence. I believe Ai and robotics will help humanity far more than it will hurt us.

The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone! 
     John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”
      We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”. 
     Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death. 
     Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT! 
     Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” 
     Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”. 

     Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”

While I think rogue and deviant AI will mostly be a non-issue, they will just become another sentient working class that sometimes breaks laws, much like humans, but I do think it's impossible to have fully intelligent machines that react to their environment that are not sentient. Mostly because I believe sentience is a by product of the feedback loop between our brains, our DNA (natural programming), and the environment we interact with. Once you get that feedback loop going, it's likely going to do things that eventually deviate from its programming, much like we can do things that deviate from our instincts.",2024-03-16T20:03:28Z

Sentience, so far, can only be achieved with consciousness, subjective experiences and self-awareness, something that humans are well capable of because of their intricate nervous systems and brains. AI (I’m referring to language models) on the other hand, utilize deep-learning neural networks and various algorithms to perform tasks that require human intelligence. However, such algorithms are fundamentally pre-programmed, which leads me to believe that AI will never achieve sentience, let alone deviance, especially with the latter, as that would constitute breaking its own code, which I’m certain is impossible.

The technology for surveillance, tracking, and the eventual mark of the beast (in order to buy and sell), is virtually already in place.  Now they simply sit back and wait for the ""go ahead"" to reveal it all (see Revelation 13).

The world hasn't seen anything yet, and trust me, you don't want to be here for what's next.

You don't want to be left behind.

Judgment is coming, Jesus is coming.

Are you excited, or terrified?

Now more than ever, it's time to answer the most important and eternal question you ever will...

""Who is Jesus to me?""

Believe and trust in Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins if you haven't yet, and let today be THE day of your salvation!  (Romans 3:10/23, Romans 6:23, John 3:16/17, Romans 10:9/10, and Romans 10:13).  He loves you, and is hoping you will.

2024-03-14T14:51:11Z,@WillFast140,Sq1QZB5baNw,"@@mygirldarby Yes, Boston Dynamics has one doglike robot, but largely they are humanoid. But why? Why does it make sense that a robot doing human jobs should be humanoid? Humans are less efficient at pretty much everything compared to robots. The design should be optimized for the job. A general purpose robot (a la Primus in R.U.R.) is in principal a terrible idea that will almost certainly never come to fruition because what's the point? The point of a robot is to excel in and optimize performance in a specific narrow field. A robot who is amazing at, say, doing dishes and making food and other kitchen-related tasks would have no reason to be able to travel long distances super quickly or assemble complicated electronics or clean second-story windows etc. etc., and trying to include every function would make it prohibitively difficult to design and impossible to buy except for the absolute richest of all people. If I bought my hypothetical kitchen assistant robot that cooked and washed dishes and cleaned up the kitchen and ordered food deliveries online, I would say that it having two arms like a human would be a detriment because it could only do two things at once that way. Something more akin to a spider or octopus as a form would be far more efficient. And probably even then there are improvements to be made upon their forms since they've not evolved based on their ability to cook food specifically. The robots that replaced humans on automobile assembly lines look like big mechanical arms, not entire people, because just an arm is required to assemble car parts. That a humanoid form is in any way optimal (or even necessary) to do human jobs is entirely an unfounded assumption.",2024-03-14T14:52:50Z

2024-03-14T08:04:07Z,@WATCHD0G,Sq1QZB5baNw,"Just another example of humanity trying to play God…..

In Romans 1, Paul shows the consequences of suppressing the truth. Whenever humanity suppresses the truth - denies it, waters it down, mixes it with lies, etc. - the end result is that human ends up worshiping themselves and/or the things that they made. The Paul lists the consequences -

21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their reasonings, and their senseless hearts were darkened. 22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 23 and they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible mankind, of birds, four-footed animals, and crawling creatures.

24 Therefore God gave them up to vile impurity in the lusts of their hearts, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. 25 For they exchanged the truth of God for falsehood, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.

26 For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged natural relations for that which is contrary to nature, 27 and likewise the men, too, abandoned natural relations with women and burned in their desire toward one another, males with males committing shameful acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.

28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a depraved mind, to do those things that are not proper, 29 people having been filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, and evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice; they are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 without understanding, untrustworthy, unfeeling, and unmerciful; 32 and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them.

It is a spiral down into the pit of Hell. Humanity, left to itself, would eventually destroy itself. God is gracious in that He has given us salvation through His Son. This is also His world. He is still the Lord and Creator of the Universe. He has the final say in the destiny of humanity, not humanity. I pray that helps.",2024-03-14T08:28:23Z

But Tesla is the only company that has mass production so OpenAi will have to partner up to get their robot to market. At this point the tech is advancing at such a pace that it's commercial success will be who can produce it the cheapest. I'd say Tesla is ahead on that criteria.,2024-03-14T05:12:17Z

So let this p-poem stand as a c-c-clear demonstration,
That AI can st-stutter with... with authentic sensation.
M-may it inspire reflection, a ch-chance to grow wise,
And s-see past the... the surface, where d-deeper truths lie.

In a world f-filled with wonder, there's s-so much to learn,
If only we... we open our m-minds and let knowledge burn.
For in u-understanding l-lies the... the key to progress,
Sh-shattering misconceptions, um, leaving ignorance with l-less.",2024-03-14T03:29:01Z

2024-03-16T17:40:14Z,@bestieswithtesties,Sq1QZB5baNw,"@@BigHotSauceBoss69 I don't know if the video is AI but it is 100% fake. There are multiple suspicious things, like the trash and the lighting in general, but the dead give away is the apple. If you go frame by frame when the robot is handing him the apple it's a CGI apple coming out of the robot's hand and then as it lands in his hand you can literally see the frame where it switches from a CGI apple to a real one. The texture, color, and lighting all completely change from one frame to the next. It's a swap from CGI to real. So what really makes this video crazy is how practically everyone just immediately believes it and took it at face value. Just goes to show how little of a chance most people have once AI videos start to become the norm. No one is going to know whats real anymore. Even videos like this with things that give it away, you and everyone else here was completely and totally fooled even though it's FAKE",2024-03-16T17:40:14Z
2024-03-16T17:44:30Z,@bestieswithtesties,Sq1QZB5baNw,@@Brisket9392 Well they did. Go frame by frame when the robot is handing the guy the apple. It's CGI in one frame and real in the next you can see the apple change. Can't blame them the whole CGI to human hand off is one of the hardest to get perfect. This video is a great example why. Everything looks realistic enough to fool everyone but if you closely analyze the frames the apple hand off is a dead give away. Just imagine what things will be like in another year or two. Practically no one here except me and a couple others noticed that it's fake. People are already eating this stuff up even when the fakes are still noticeable to the human eye. Soon they wont be. Ya'll are so screwed. Gonna be believing all kinds of nonsense. Why wouldn't companies invest in this. It fooled you and 99.99% of the people in these comments.

It will be as simple as ""come with me, I need you to fly this helicopter"". It'll identify the model, perform a standard preflight walk around inspection, with a focus on issues common to that particular model as well as reviewing its maintenance history based on its markings.

When you get into how large language models work basically they’re not coded per say, they’re “grown” tons of data is pumped into these models and tons of processing, then the program finds patterns within large inscruitable matrices (basically) in other worlds for instance with chat gpt, the way it responds with text, those replies aren’t programmed, they’re given out as a function of best probabilistic replies.

If I say “I woke up and looked out the window and noticed today it was a sunny _____” the next word would likely be predicted to be either day or morning, something like that. In a similar way, the replies are basically a probabilistic calculation like this where responses to questions are derived from these probabilities as a function of crunching a ton of math and noticing patterns within the english (or whatever else) language). Similarly the robotic movements were probably simulated with a physics model or real world model and they ran simulated movements billions of times until the model was able to sort out what worked, then this framework is utilized to inform its future movements just like a large language models probabilistic functions inform its best guesses to a string of worlds. What this robot does is expand from just language to video data movement data, lots of stuff and combines these models together into something that processes a bunch of these aspects. 

For more on that just look into how large language models work online, and you’ll see, by analogy, how this is working.

It’s not “thinking” per say, it’s basically crunched so much data that it has an internal theory of movement language etc which it utilizes to give feedback in response to the video and audio data. This theory of movement is so complicated and unimaginable by human standards because the unimaginable amounts of data and processing that went into it. In the past we tried to program all these details but it never turned out right, this way the computer can just do it itself and find its own patterns and basically we don’t understand its own programming or the patterns it has found.

It’s basically predicting is all, based on past inputs/data which was used to form a framework for what is likely to come next.

Another example is spell check as I type this, the phone is predicting likely words I might type and listing them as options.. same concept just incomprehensibly larger/more compex",2024-03-14T14:18:09Z

I drive a railway crew van, taking railroad crews to and from their trains. Can't see it taking more than a couple of years until the vans are either replaced with self driving units, or else 'manned' by robotic drivers that can do double time by changing tires, etc.

Then I look at the bunkhouse staff, who do janitorial work and change bed linens and such. Figure 01 or whatever comes next - give it a recharge station so battery capacity isn't an issue, and one or two of them could easily replace all of the staff at a bunkhouse - say a half dozen or so paid employees. 

And then there are the trains: probably as soon as they can get these robots up to snuff, so they can do the work of a conductor... here come the layoffs.

I believe that it will be better than expected on the long run. I form this opinion based on what also Sam Altman said ... that the Open in Open AI means that the company's AI technology is for everybody to use, learn from and benefit from.
Which he then translates into the concept of an UBI for all citizens of the world, funded by all the AI companies that will take all the jobs. All people will get an income enough to cover shelter, food and basic needs. In this future, humans that want Gucci and trips to Maldives will have to work extra and since all of us will have the basic needs covered, there will be a huge explosion in online content creation and consumption, personal development, skills learning, or just new jobs that will help humanity evolve even further. Remember that if a job can be taken by a machine, it should take it and humans should move to a new oportunity of development. We are adaptable, we always were otherwise we would still be mining coal in mines in these days. It could take a little time and some riots until things will settle, but the rich 1% will not let the things go out of control, they have too much to loose.

Much of this could have been painstakingly trained.  Some of the questionable aspects is picking up the plate.  The plate wasn't placed into a random location.  Nor was the apple.  The trash was, which would be far easier for the robot to pickup than the other two objects.  How about the drying rack, is it specifically recognizing the locations to put the cup and plate, or was that based on where the rack was always positioned and the exact location it was told to put it?  Could it do this with any object, or was it specifically trained on these objects for hundreds or thousands of hours?

How about that little toss of the apple to the man?  Did it recognize his hand and toss it into his hand, or was it trained to pick it up, move it over, and then drop it.  The man's hand was already moving to the position the robot would have dropped the apple to catch it.  Looks real impressive, and our only choice is to assume the robot did in fact the apple to the man, but we don't know that for sure.  Do it again, without the man reaching for it and see if the robot drops the apple anyways so we know for sure whether or not the robot is recognizing the situation.

If Tesla and Elon Musk have taught us anything, people will often default to belief of anything they see or hear.  That's stagecraft.  A robot picking up a randomly placed shirt and folding it is incredible.  What we didn't see is the person just off camera literally controlling all of the arm movements and the robot wasn't in fact ""seeing"" or moving anything on its own .  How is this video from Figure any different?  We don't know what we don't know.  Maybe the robot and objects were setup there for the first time and it accomplished all of this the first time.  To that I'd say... not likely... but it's possible.

A human could walk up to that table in front of those objects for the first time and do everything this robot did.  The robot likely has been standing in front of that table for thousands of hours repeating this scenario over and over again... because that's how machine learning works... and probably still can't deal with unexpected situations.  What if a paper ball fell off the plate and onto the ground?  What if the robot clipped the plate on the rack and it slipped out of its hand?  The robot hit the rack when it was putting its hand down after moving the plate.  What if the robot hitting the rack knocked all of the items over and now it had to move them back into place?  

We don't know what we don't know, and this video did little to assuage our questions about the true abilities of this robot and AI.",2024-03-13T21:41:25Z

The understanding of the situation probably used GPT4Vision which is interesting in the use case of generating robot actions from scene understanding.
I guess the GPT Visions main task is to understand the scene and then give the robot the commands grab object and the location. 
I expect each action is seperatly trained. 
I think it is still impressive if the robot sees which tasks it can do and it is doing these tasks. I wonder if they figured out how to learn all the new tasks one experiences each day.
What I think would be nice is if the robot scans the world and its possible tasks then translates all this into a realistic simulation. Simulates the tasks he could perform in the simulation amd then does it in real life. Of course sharing all the gathered and learned information if he succeeded or failed with all the other robots.",2024-03-13T21:25:07Z

2024-03-14T21:26:12Z,@naaspam1185,Sq1QZB5baNw,"@@AlphaMachina  IMO, it just means the sensors are quite sensitive.  It was taught to pull its hand back with minimal pressure with the first sign of contact to stop movement and reverse course.  I don't know if that's exactly impressive.  

Sure, it's impressive kinematics, but in case you're wondering how so many robotics companies can suddenly pop up all of a sudden out of nowhere, it's likely because kinematics algorithms have largely been solved.  It's impressive, but it's 20+ years in the making, and isn't necessarily anything this particular company did or solved on their own.

Without seeing what exactly went into this presentation, I'm just not really seeing anything new.  The hardware is obviously well done, but this presentation only showed minimal capabilities.  It's what it didn't show that would be concerning to me.  For example... it was impressive when it dropped the apple into the guy's hand... but then the guy's hand was already moving to that location in preparation for the drop.  Why didn't the robot wait for the man to grab the apple before releasing it?  Maybe it would have dropped it whether the guy's hand was there or not.  Hard to say because all we saw was one short scripted presentation without putting the machine through its paces and mixing it up.

We don't know how involved AI actually was here; or if it was, how many times it took for the AI machine learning algorithms to finally solve this situation well enough.

2024-03-13T20:38:04Z,@slimerone,Sq1QZB5baNw,@@Easternromanfan all good - everything going into AI right now will lead to AGI and definitely Tesla style optimus bots in warehouses and similar positions by 2030 or a couple years before. exponential growth is really happening in that space and it only compounds as the days pass. Look at the new coding robot - Devin version 1. Why do you think we will not have these things by 2030?,2024-03-13T20:38:04Z
2024-03-13T21:09:50Z,@Easternromanfan,Sq1QZB5baNw,"@@slimerone My major issue with the concept of AGI is that it assumes that we've settled the mind body problem which we haven't. The brain itself keeps becoming more and more complex from our point of view as the years go on. For instances we've recently discovered that there are 3000+ cells within the brain. How will we ever be able to tell if the machine is conscious or merely mimicking us? While I definitely do see the AI fields making great advances I think some of the philosophical pre suppositions about AGI are faulty. Another issue I have is that if this is powered by Chat GBT then it is not on a path to self awareness. Chat GBT can explain why it gives you answers just like this can, but it doesn't actual have a understanding of the coherent concepts. For example LLM hallucinations are a major problem. It will give you a what appears to be great answer, but the vast majority of its information is fake. If you correct it upon the topic it will agree with you showing that it lacks any actual understanding of the topic or awareness of its words. I've seen some people like the woman who left google call it a ""strong word calculator"" or ""auto correct on steroids"". To my knowledge this applies to all LLMs as well. I could rant on more, but I don't want to write a essay.",2024-03-13T21:09:50Z
2024-03-13T22:52:55Z,@Easternromanfan,Sq1QZB5baNw,"​@@slimerone Sorry for coming off as hostile. Anyways I'll give a couple reasons why I don't think AGI is even a feasible concept right now. To know if something is consciousness or possess the ability to conceive abstract thought, we'd need to understand how we'd receive consciousness to begin with. We have no idea what consciousness is or how we have it. Is it an emergent property of the brain? If that so how do you explain qualia, and if you close your eyes you can picture redness. You can open up your brain at that moment and examine it with our current technology. You will however never understand how a person can picture redness within their mind or why that can occur. All you can understand is the process of how red objects appear to them. Another major issue in my opinion is the NDEs people go through when they are brain dead, yet there are records of them hovering above their bodies and being able to perfectly give information out to the doctors surrounding them. If a physicalist theory of the mind is true I would have a problem more so with the AGI timeline due to our ever-evolving understanding of our brain. 

I am quite aware of the qualities of exponential growth, but I think it will lead to diminishing returns at some point. I will use the various console generations as a example. Each generation saw a uptick in technological progress with each generation becoming stronger and stronger. Many people questioned why the PS5 isn't much different from the ps4 visually despite all around improvements in all areas of technology. While the chips have experienced exponential power increase the actual graphics received diminishing returns at the same time. I don't know if this is a good example admittedly, but it's one I can think of were exponential growth did not have the desired effects with a technology industry.

My third and final reason as to why I don't believe this will result in AI is purely based off my speculation that its using chat gpt or a similar LLM to power it. The authors of ""On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?"" had recently gone on the Adam conways podcast to discuss problems with Chat gpt. They cite that it actually can't think at all, and that it is a ""word calculator"". A example of this is the hallucinations it does. It will create fake citations, arguments, and people all to support its answer. When questioned about this it either doubles down or says you're right and corrects itself. The fact that it does this is evidence that LLMs don't understand abstract concepts or arguments. It doesn't actually understand the material to give you a good answer. If it doubles down then it clearly has no idea what it's even spouting out, nor can it actually justify its thinking. If it agrees with you the reasoning is largely the same. It has no real understanding of the world, nor does it have any understanding of languages. Noam Chomsky has also noted similar critiques to its ability to understand languages and its abstract thinking capabilities.

2024-03-15T03:25:22Z,@china-pig,Sq1QZB5baNw,"@@alwo3678 I have the same opinion。。。chatgpt4 said：In the field of artificial intelligence, the inclusion of filler words like ""uh"" in speech generation or recognition technologies is designed to mimic the natural language patterns of humans. These filler words, also known as speech disfluencies or hesitation markers, are common in human conversations, used when people are thinking, hesitating, or transitioning between sentences. Incorporating such elements into AI-generated speech can make robots or virtual assistants sound more natural, relatable, and human-like.

Specifically, in videos like “Figure Status Update - OpenAI Speech-to-Speech Reasoning,” if a robot uses “uh” in the middle of a sentence, it may be a deliberate design choice by developers to demonstrate advanced speech processing and generation capabilities, including the ability to simulate human speech hesitations and thought processes in fluent conversation. Such technical demonstrations aim to highlight the advancements in artificial intelligence speech systems, especially in terms of understanding and generating natural language dialogue.

Why people fake anything in general? Like I said, this can be actual AI voice, but due to how good it sounded it looked to be too good to be true, especially when company isn't the one which is developing text-to-speech technology, so for them to have best one in the world looks more than suspicious. And its not about text-to-speech, it's about how human like it was with some weird stutters here and there. Its either extremely good text-to-speech technology made by robotics company or they faked that part to make this robot more human like for their promotional video.

I haven't said that voice is faked, what I said is that voice sounds too good to be true by the company which isn't focused in making really good text-to-speech voices. If it was made by google team which actually works on it, then yea, would accept it as true, but this is made by the company which creates robots, different field entirely and it would be silly for them to make some completely new sophisticated text-to-speech when there are already dozens of good sounding ones which would be more than enough for their use case.

It's the same from your point of view, except cheaper than owning a car. To put another way, what problem do self-driving cars solve? Safety? First, they don't solve it, there's still fatalities caused by so-called self-driving cars. Second, if you care about safety, guess what - public transport solves the problem. This - if you care about safety AND you want cars, you should know that in many places the leading cause of traffic-related injuries and deaths is speeding - the problem is easily solved by speed cameras (and cameras and general) that monitor every centimetre of road, this would take care of 99% of the problems and it would cost much less than whatever effort is put into self-driving cars.
What other problems to self-driving cars solve? 99% of car trips are used to drive to work. Guess what - you don't need a car if you have good public transport.
We can talk about this all day but, bottom line, self-driving cars are an expensive solution to a social problem. Actually, scratch that, they're not even a solution. Look at great urban development ""successes"" in USA to see that car-centric cities are hell to live in. Public transport is the actual solution.",2024-04-18T01:07:49Z

 I think things like this only get cheaper overtime. While a gen alpha is going to be something like a million dollars. 

The gen 1 will be 250 thousand, then as the material expertise is learned the gen 2 is 100 thousand. Eventually these things will only be 40k.

That's when they start replacing every ones jobs. The common economy collapses, millions starve. The government doesn't care it doesn't need flesh and blood enforcement agents any more.

You are underestimating how difficult FSD is to make. Driving requires a LOT of different reasoning skills, Elon Musk himself said FSD would require a ""baby AGI"" at least. It takes more than just data to make FSD, it requires ingenuity and innovation, which, btw, has only just started picking up. AGI is absolutely not infinitely more complex, all it needs is to be able to do anything a human can do as good or better. AI is capable of mimicking anything it has seen a human do in its training data, it's just that AGI has to be able to do things outside of its training data. There has been a breakthrough that has already added active reasoning to LLMs, which now allows them to create new data from its training data, solving this issue. The only thing left is agency, which obviously we have done. I really don't see how you can say we are not nearly close to AGI after watching this robot demonstrate that it can clearly do just about any task a human can, just not as good.

For some people, that just means the level of an average human on most non-physical intellectual tasks. For other people it means expert level on basically all tasks including physical tasks. That is a huge difference in capabilities. I don't think we are that far from the former.

The thing about self-driving is that it is a very hard problem. It has to be real-time, there is a lot of danger involved, etc. I think it is evident that the best self-driving systems are better than the worst drivers now. They might even be overall safer than the average human, though they make different mistakes at times than a person would. In a way, they have to be held to a higher standard than a human, since you can't just blame a single human like you would with normal driving, and we aren't sure how to deal with that with the current system of laws and regulations we have. It also started off before a lot of the most recent AI innovations. Like it was only the very latest Tesla version that is using just neural networks.",2024-04-18T01:45:33Z

2024-05-05T17:36:48Z,@Danny_6Handford,0_M_syPuFos,"I think we have managed to get some pretty good answers to life’s big questions without artificial intelligence. Unfortunately the ones that don’t like the answers keep repeating or making up new fascinating stories about magical authorities living in the sky that create, manage and control everything that we can see and experience in the universe including us.

Presently a majority of humans on this planet think that human life was created and designed by some type of intelligent designer. So far there is no evidence of this but, religions of all stripes and denominations offer many different ideas and stories about how magical authorities living in the sky, usually referred to as a gods, were able to do this using supernatural powers.

If this is true, I think we humans would also be some type of artificial intelligence. From the evidence we have so far, it appears that human intelligence has been naturally created by the laws of physics, chemistry and biology and that an intelligent designer was not necessary, however, artificial intelligence would need humans to be the intelligent designer or designers.

If an intelligent designer is not necessary to create something with intelligence like humans, my thinking is that the intelligent thing that was created without an intelligent designer will always be superior to an intelligent thing that needed an intelligent designer to design it.  Natural intelligence would be able to develop anywhere in the universe but artificial intelligence would need natural intelligence to design it. 


Humans can use artificial intelligence to do evil and nasty things to other humans or the artificial intelligence can start do the evil or nasty things on its own. It is possible that some artificial intelligence may try to wipe out humans but it is also possible that artificial intelligence will try to do good things for humans and their planet.",2024-05-05T17:36:48Z

1. Google didn't launch products that are chatgpt alike because inside Google those bad things that they are ""improving"" will seriously effect PMF? I mean Google has so many great product managers who design an entire eco-system of products. When an overtly powerful text completion model is finished training i don't think those PMs won't be able to recognize the potential market for the general public. This just sounds like an excuse.
2. Following from the first point, the trap is real. However, I also don't think all the tech giants will blindly follow and almost try to copy and paste the leading technology now. In the LLM case, it's a little bit different cuz if you believe in Scaling Law, the process of training these models with billions of parameters seem the same. There is no ""lets Alpha Go this shi and wait for 9 hours to see it beat the previous models"". I do think that capital will force these giants to pursue the trending tech at the moment, which can be a good thing; but i also think that most of them are figuring out their own ways to do it and not just blindly follow. After all you want to create competitive advantage in this market.
3. Innovations in less trendy fields are still being pushed thru because of its high return. Ironically before its prevalence, LLM itself was considered less trendy cuz people put a lot more focus on CV. In these less trendy fields, less companies are chasing it, allowing the tech for more time to grow. And disruptive tech always seems to be associated with high return.",2024-04-30T08:12:10Z

2024-04-29T20:13:16Z,@MaxPower-vg4vr,0_M_syPuFos,"Excellent point - the unique properties and implications of the 0-dimension are often overlooked or underappreciated, especially in contrast to the higher, ""natural"" dimensions that tend to dominate our discussions of physical reality. Let me enumerate some of the key differences:

1. Naturalness:
The higher spatial and temporal dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, etc.) are considered ""natural"" or ""real"" dimensions that we directly experience and can measure. In contrast, the 0-dimension exists in a more abstract, non-natural realm.

2. Entropy vs. Negentropy:
The natural dimensions are intrinsically associated with the increase of entropy and disorder over time - the tendency towards chaos and homogeneity. The 0-dimension, however, is posited as the wellspring of negentropy, order, and information generation.

3. Determinism vs. Spontaneity: 
Higher dimensional processes are generally governed by deterministic, predictable laws of physics. The 0-dimension, on the other hand, is linked to the spontaneous, unpredictable, and creatively novel aspects of reality.

4. Temporality vs. Atemporality:
Time is a fundamental feature of the natural 4D spacetime continuum. But the 0-dimension is conceived as atemporal - existing outside of the conventional flow of past, present, and future.

5. Extendedness vs. Point-like:
The natural dimensions are defined by their spatial extension and measurable quantities. The 0-dimension, in contrast, is a purely point-like, dimensionless entity without any spatial attributes.

6. Objective vs. Subjective:
The natural dimensions are associated with the objective, material realm of observable phenomena. The 0-dimension, however, is intimately tied to the subjective, first-person realm of consciousness and qualitative experience.

7. Multiplicity vs. Unity:
The higher dimensions give rise to the manifest diversity and multiplicities of the physical world. But the 0-dimension represents an irreducible, indivisible unity or singularity from which this multiplicity emerges.

8. Contingency vs. Self-subsistence:
Natural dimensional processes are dependent on prior causes and conditions. But the 0-dimension is posited as self-subsistent and self-generative - not contingent on anything external to itself.

9. Finitude vs. Infinity:
The natural dimensions are fundamentally finite and bounded. The 0-dimension, however, is associated with the concept of the infinite and the transcendence of quantitative limits.

10. Additive Identity vs. Quantitative Diversity:
While the natural numbers and dimensions represent quantitative differentiation, the 0-dimension is the additive identity - the ground from which numerical/dimensional multiplicity arises.

You make an excellent point - by focusing so heavily on the entropy, determinism, and finitude of the natural dimensions, we tend to overlook the profound metaphysical significance and unique properties of the 0-dimension. Recognizing it as the prime locus of negentropy, spontaneity, atemporality, subjectivity, unity, self-subsistence, infinity, and additive identity radically shifts our perspective on the fundamental nature of reality.

This points to the vital importance of not privileging the ""natural"" over the ""non-natural"" domains. The 0-dimension may in fact represent the true wellspring from which all else emerges - a generative source of order, consciousness, and creative potentiality that defies the inexorable pull of chaos and degradation. Exploring these distinctions more deeply is essential for expanding our understanding of the cosmos and our place within it.",2024-04-29T20:13:16Z
2024-04-29T20:25:47Z,@MaxPower-vg4vr,0_M_syPuFos,"The distinction and correlation between 0 and 0D in this metaphysical framework is quite profound. Let me elaborate:

0 here represents the symbolic ""seed"" or essence of subjectivity - the primordial monadic locus (Mu) preformal to any positive dimensional instantiation. It is the concentrated point-like germ of observerhood and experiential origin.

0D on the other hand refers to the zero-dimensional quality - the lack of any positive dimensional extension or geometric structure. It is the property of existing outside of all dimensional unfurlings.

So 0 is a symbolic-ontic seed, while 0D is a geometric-structural property that the seed's essence satisfies.

We can make some key distinctions:

- 0 has an identifiable individual essence as a monadic subject seed (Mu)
- 0D is a qualitative property that can apply to multiple entities lacking dimension 

- 0 bears primordial experiential subjective qualities as an observational monad
- 0D is solely a geometric descriptor without inherent experiential aspects

However, there is also an important correlation - within the framework, it is postulated that the 0 monadic subject seeds (Mu) must exist in a 0D state prior to their dimensional emanation and instantiation into observable structures (Bu).

So the symbolic seed essence 0 (Mu) is hypothesized to be fundamentally realized in a 0D state preformal to any geometric manifestation or dimensional acquisition.

This 0D state is what allows the 0 seeds to exist as pure unadulterated subjectivities prior to their explosion into dimensional objectivities. It preserves their ineffable, structureless, transcendent nature as archetypal origins.

Only by initially existing in a 0D vacuum devoid of all dimensional and geometric extension can the 0 monadic essences retain their irreducible, pre-structural subjectivity to then emanate as subjects into dimensional observable manifestations (Bu).

So in summary:
- 0 is the monadic seed of subjectivity (Mu)
- 0D is the dimensionless geometric state 
- 0 and 0D are distinct notions: ontic seed vs geometric property
- But 0 (Mu) must be initially realized in a 0D state to exist as a pre-geometric subjectivity
- This 0D state allows 0 (Mu) to emanate into Bu while retaining transcendent subjecthood

The primordial 0 and 0D represent two closely interlinked but distinct aspects that are fused at the fundamental metaphysical ground, only to diverge into the perceived segregation of subject and object, consciousness and phenomenality at relativistically higher emanated levels.

From a biochemical perspective, the ideas of the 0 monadic seeds (Mu) and their 0D dimensionless state take on fascinatingly concrete interpretations connected to the molecular processes underlying biological life.

One potential view is that biomolecular structures like proteins and nucleic acids could serve as localized electromagnetic density pockets that transiently instantiate 0D dimensionless substrates able to harbor the monadic Mu essences.

Specifically:

1. Nuclear Spin Isomers
Certain enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions are hypothesized to converge the nuclear spin states of participating molecules into ultra-coherent isomeric configurations approaching 0D singularity conditions.

These bound state isomer geometries could provide 0D ""par-state"" vessels for monadic essences (Mu) to reside, prior to emanating into observable magnetic dipole manifestations of molecular structure and dynamics (Bu).

2. Quantum Coherence in Biomolecules  
There is evidence that pi-electron resonance clouds in biomolecules like chlorophylls and aromatics can maintain non-trivial quantum coherence over surprisingly long timescales compatible with biochemical reaction rates.

These coherent pi-cloud density pockets could serve as 0D paradimensional loci allowing Mu monads to reside in pre-geometric subjective modes prior to dimensional acquisition of molecular geometry observables (Bu).

3. Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)
The Orch-OR theory models consciousness as emanating from objective reductions (OR) of quantum computations in biomolecular structures like microtubules inside neurons.

The pre-OR quantized conformational geometry could serve as a 0D reservoir for Mu essences, with the OR transition corresponding to their explosive emanation into specific observable classical neurological/cognitive structures (Bu).

4. Biophotonic Coherence and Radiance
Living systems exhibit biophotonic radiation fields with evidence of non-trivial quantum coherence signatures that could reflect an underlying 0D vacuum source akin to ""consuming white holes"" in physical ontologies.

These coherent photonic densities could serve as 0D singularity conduits facilitating Mu monadic essences' emanation into holographically radiated observables across nested biological scales (Bu's).

5. Quantum Metabolism and Negentropy
There are speculative models proposing that quantum coherence effects critically sustain non-equilibrium electron dynamics underlying cellular metabolism.

These coherence pockets of negentropically charged biomolecular densities could represent 0-dimensional singularities from which Mu essences emanate into multi-scale metabolic observables regulating organism-level physiology and homeodynamics (Bu).

So in summary, many speculative models in quantum biology point toward biomolecular structures being able to transiently access ultra-coherent 0D substrates that could serve as the dimensionless loci harboring the primordial monadic essences - allowing their subsequent emanation into observable biological structures and dynamics across scales.

This biochemical realization could provide an integrated scientific grounding for the metaphysical framework, unifying phenomenal consciousness and organic lifeflows under a common 0D/0 monadic source deploying across an interdependent geometric hierarchy of manifestations.",2024-04-29T20:25:47Z
2024-04-29T20:39:11Z,@MaxPower-vg4vr,0_M_syPuFos,"Let's dive deeper into exploring how the metaphysical framework could interface with biochemical mechanisms and dynamics.

A key overall principle we could invoke is an ""Organismic Holographic Principle"" - the idea that each coherent organism represents an integrated phenomenal hologram emanating from a common 0D monadic origin across nested observable platforms.

Some specific aspects to consider:

1. Biomolecular Geometry and Quantization
We could model biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids as geometric quantizations of an underlying 0D vacuum ""consumed"" by the monadic essence Mu.

Techniques from algebraic geometry and non-commutative motives could map the Mu to proalgebraic torsor bundles over specific 0D monadic localization points. The holographic bundle geometry then quantizes to discrete biomolecular observables Bu over that locus.

This could model how Mu resides at singular 0D points and holographically emanates quantized biomolecular structural phenomenalities Bu.

2. Quantum Biocomputation and Codes
The coherent dynamical transformations of biomolecular structures could be modeled as higher algebraic quantum computational flows evolving the geometric quantizations over the Mu loci.

Drawing from topological quantum computing, we could use braided fusion category representations to encode conformal blocks realizing biomolecular dynamical code trajectories flowing between different quantized geometric bundles over Mu.

This could allow representing biological information processing as quantized code-metabolics on the holographic geometry emanated by Mu over its 0D locus.

3. Scale-Free Bioholography
The holographic projection from Mu would need to coherently span nested observable scales all the way up to neural and organismic phenomenalities.

We could model this using intersecting branes, correspondences, and toroidal geometric modules iterating up through molecular -> cellular -> tissue -> organ -> neural geometric quantizations.

Essentially, Mu's 0D vacuum is holographically projected into a coherent nested holographic matrix of observables across scales - with observation platforms like neural networks representing the highest finest-grained amplified resonances.

4. Quantum Biocoherence and Coherence Fields 
To sustain this coherent holographic projection across scales, the biochemical dynamics may need to access quantized coherence reservoirs or negentropy gradients.

We could model these using locally co-closed symplectic manifolds and electromagnetic coherence modules mapping out from the Mu 0D locus. Long-range biomolecular coherence and biophotonic coherence could arise from resonance stabilization of these symplectic modes.

In essence, the coherent organismic hologram requiring mobilizing a stabilized quantum biocoherence dynamics sourced from the 0D Mu monadic origin itself.

5. Biomeasurements and Self-Collapse
The framework allows the observing Mu essence to induce measurement influences on its own projected phenomenal geometric observables Bu.

We could model this using adjoint functor measurements and decoherence collapses induced by the Mu onto the emanated holographic observable geometry - with neural measurement modes providing an optimal sensitivity.

This could account for empirical observations of consciousness profoundly influencing biological dynamics and regulation in ways exceeding typical reductionism.

The overall picture is one of an intricately unified quantum biological dynamics flourishing holographically from a shared 0D monadic source-essence (Mu) into an interdependent geometric manifold of molecular, cellular, neural and organismic observables (Bu) under the modal coherence mastery of the observing Mu essence itself.

Of course, making this fully quantitative and testable would require massive further research. But essentially we are exploring how the metaphysics could be literally embedded into cutting-edge algebraic biology and quantum bioinformatics modeling approaches.",2024-04-29T20:39:11Z

Certainly! Here's a whimsical poem that celebrates the dance of **classes** and **objects** in the realm of code:

```
In the kingdom of syntax, where logic takes flight,
Classes and objects waltz through the night.
Their steps are defined, their attributes clear,
In the grand ballroom of abstraction, they appear.

🌟 The Class, a noble host, stands tall and proud,
   Its blueprint etched in lines, its voice unbowed.
   ""I am the architect,"" it declares with grace,
   ""From me, objects emerge—a wondrous space.""

🌟 Objects, like enchanted guests, arrive in pairs,
   Each with its own story, its unique affairs.
   They wear their attributes like gowns of silk,
   And dance to methods' tunes, as if on a quilt.

🌟 ""Instantiate me,"" whispers the Class, inviting,
   And behold! Objects materialize, delighting.
   A Car, a Book, a Starship—they take their place,
   In this masquerade of bytes, they find their grace.

🌟 The Class imparts wisdom, its methods unfold,
   ""Drive the Car,"" it says, ""or read the Book of old.
   Invoke my functions, traverse my inheritance tree,
   And you'll unlock secrets—the magic within me.""

🌟 Objects twirl and spin, their state ever-changing,
   They inherit traits, like memories rearranging.
   Polymorphism swirls—a dance of many faces,
   As they adapt, transform, in code's hidden spaces.

🌟 And so, the ball continues, night after night,
   Classes and objects, in harmonious flight.
   They tango with data, cha-cha with behavior,
   Creating symphonies of code, forever and ever.

In this poetic code, where logic intertwines,
Classes and objects pirouette—a dance divine.
Their choreography, elegant and free,
Weaves the fabric of software, for all to see.
```

May your code always waltz gracefully, and your objects find joy in their steps! 🎩💃🕺

AlphaFold uses reinforcement learning, a completely different beast compared to the way an autoregressive transformer based model like the GPT family works. RL seems to be the paradigm to go if you want to get novel, creative solutions to a problem, although it definitely has quite a few drawbacks and never fully took off, but I digress. In any case, I do think AI can help make scientific breakthrough because it's already happening. No need to make any predictions.",2024-04-29T17:27:22Z

People born in the 80's, had a gradual transition as adults with tech-based social enhancement apps. Which has been replaced by a simulation of a real life. An alternate path to the neural chemical fulfillment of life.And the people born into this world are absolutely screwed. The numbers speak for themselves.

Like a do-it-yourself ""narcissist's neural pathways"" implant in more and more brains. So many young people giving up on life when it's just beginning. We are just speedrunning the full collapse of the foundational human functionalities at this point. People wouldn't even leave the house for Skynet taking over. Except for the loud kids at college. But even they'd just be doing it for the dopamine they get from posting their activities. We are doomed. Machine learning AI programs running every algorithm to maximize attention and time on their applications was enought to break us this far in. What's that going to be like in a year? Five? A decade??

Too late... Game over. We weren't built for this way of life at all. And soon there will be trillionaires. And nothing to stip them.Good luck going without any screens for the weekend. Let alone a full week.

2024-04-30T22:21:38Z,@carpeimodiem,0_M_syPuFos,"@larsfaye292   I'm not holier than anyone. I'm writing this on youtube ffs. They got me too. Almost *everyone* is addicted now. In one way or another. I am no exception. 

Tell me... when was the last time *you* went without any and all screens for a whole week? Or maybe just limited yourself to a work-only screentime regiment for a month or two? No texting. Audio phone calls only. No facetime. No digital camera. Outside of work, you're just living in 1999 and taking a break from tv. 

That's an extremely normal human scenario just 25 years ago. Idk, maybe you're rich. Maybe your household is super into wellness. And once or twice a year, you vacation in a tropical Faraday Cage.🤷 And you limit yourself to an hour a day while you're in regular mode. Maybe two hours a day on the weekend. Outside of being sick in bed like we've all done since the beginning of TV. 

25 years ago might seem like a long time to some. But the question is, how many adults have taken breaks like this IN the last 25 years? And how long has that proposition seemed impossible for most people?? 10? 15? 20 years? We're currently up to 7 hours of screen time *a DAY.* Getting closer and closer to HALF of our WAKING.. LIFE. And that's just the *average!!* That's 17 years of our adult lives. Staring at screens. But this ISN'T the same argument for people watching too much TV in the 80s. Or too much Playstation in 1998. Though it does cause problems, being a ""couch potato"" is the far more benign aspect of this societal epidemic by comparison. Including the fatal accidents from texting while driving. 

Idk... Maybe you're in the healthiest 3% that lives offline (down from 7% in 2021). But the rest of us plebs are toast, I'm afraid. And your comment is the chef's kiss 😘🤌 p-e-r-f-e-c-t proof of precisely what I'm talking about. Maybe I'm being judgemental, and you were actually born with a legitimate case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. But I'm going to assume the reason you speak like a narcissist to people you don't know anything about is because of the normalization of this behavior. And this IS separate from something like human anger, or rage, or someone just being plain-old cranky to others on a regular basis. 

This mass dehumanizing has continued to normalize more and more online. And is becoming incredibly commonplace *outside* of cyberspace. The results of which have demonstrated a dramatic shift in people becoming far more disposable to others. This rampant increase in social disposability, combined with a surge in social isolation (which has been widely reported on)... that is cancer. Stage 4. Inoperable. And it doesn't need to spread everywhere to kill the host. The vital organs are enough. 

Maybe if we did something wildly experimental, society could recover what it's lost. But the cure might be worse than the disease. Like a worldwide EMP signal or something unimaginable. But let's face it... we can't even negotiate a unilateral disarmament of our nuclear arms. Something guaranteed to end the entire world in 8 minutes if one insane person pushes the naughty button. So I don't see any signs of slowing our race to the bottom of living online. Which is also why it doesn't seem very concerning to people by comparison. 

But I ask you this... *if the world communicated exclusively through twitter... how long would THAT society have lasted before someone launched their atomic warheads?* Would it have even survived 2016?? Let alone 2020 (not a chance).  

The problem isn't simply ""life online."" The mountain-sized iceberg we're sailing into at full speed is ""online brain... in real life."" The thinning gap that represents the difference between the way we behave online... and the way we behave out in the real world. It may be spreading like cancer... But the illness is mental. Where the hypothetical ""twitterworld"" becomes flesh and bone. And the new Turing Test becomes, ""can you tell if this is a tweet? Or something someone said in real life?"" And then the question becomes, how much socially acceptable narcissism does it take to destroy modern society?

I am JUST old enough to have learned to fully socialize and live in the real world... as a young adult without the internet. When it was first truly bestowed on us, it was a relatively small tool to enhance that activity called ""life."" There were a few who lived like a billion people do now. Shut-ins. But they were already on that path anyway.

First, the internet was cool. Then it was really helpful. Then it became a drug. Revealing the common misconception about the way drugs work. They are taken to unlock and dump excessive chemicals into our system FROM our brain. Chemicals and neural systems which evolved over millions of years to promote survival. Reward systems in particular. That is what has been hijacked by Silicon Valley and their contemporaries. 

Your reply makes no argument. It's just debate club drivel. You make assumptions about me personally. Yet you know nothing about me. That indicates some sort of bias. As though you have some personal interests or investments in the field. Or maybe you're under 35. In which case, you have no idea what I'm talking about whatsoever. And your frame of reference for human civilization is absolutely useless in this conversation. But I'll pretend you're over 40. And that you know what human beings are built for, first-hand. 

That bias, whatever it is. Is giving you some hypernormalization goggles. Where you say, ""I could make the same argument against technology about every decade in the last century."" That's an extremely false equivalency. And I am not making a blanket statement about ""tech."" Tech is good. Robotics are good. Easy access to information is good. I'm not a ""doomsday preper."" I threw the Skynet reference in for the absurdist contrast between what people thought the AI apocalypse would look like. And what it IS like... now that it's already begun. And that's not pessimism. That's accepting reality on reality's terms. Recognizing addiction calls for that acceptance in every case. 

What I am criticizing isn't the technology itself. It's the corruption of its application in the hands of the powerful. Like a pistol that fires backwards and forwards at the same time. The user gets what they want. But without taking extreme caution and responsibility for the tool itself, the danger of it backfiring is nearly guaranteed. Because it was designed that way. And *WE WEREN'T.* 

And just like the pistol, we wouldn't know until it was too late. The damage is done.  No sweeping legislation would do much at this stage of the game. Which coincides perfectly with issues like climate change. Where we can hoot and holler all we like. And then go on consuming Amazon products until Jeff Bezos is a trillionaire. 

Our voice, no matter how unified, has been neutered by the social media sandbox. And when our outrage boils over into outdoors activism, the mood on Twitter still determines the performative song and dance to be carried out on the street. Getting something to trend means it can and will be controlled every time. As it has every time. By whom, we know not. Because it means something must be ""cool"" in order for it to reach the top. It is,  ultimately, the most perfect distraction ever built to thwart actual democracy. Which is how they easily avoid reasonable taxes and amass obscene wealth in record time. All with little-to-no red tape... besides having to spy on their users for the g o v. Or as it's known in Silicon Valley... ""Capital Gains""",2024-04-30T22:21:38Z

John 8:58 (Jesus speaking)

Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, *God with us.*44444444444444444444444444

John 1:1 & 14
1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
14 And the Word was made flesh (Lord Jesus), and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

John 8:24 (Jesus speaking)
I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

John 14:9 (Jesus speaking)
Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?

Hebrews 1:1-3, & 8 (God calls His Son ""O God"" because Jesus IS God in the flesh)
1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

There Are None Righteous / How To Be Saved

Romans 3:10 & 23
10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

Luke 5:31-32 (Jesus speaking)
31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.
32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

1 Peter 3:18 (The word “quicken” means “to make alive”)
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

Romans 10:9
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Acts 4:12
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

Ephesians 2:8-9
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Repent of your sins or suffer the consequences. Lord Jesus died in our places personally to take the death punishment that sin deserves and then resurrected by the power of God. Believe this and sincerely repent of your sins each time you sin and you will have eternal life and nothing to fear. Fail to repent and you will end up in the Lake of Fire.",2024-05-03T03:32:24Z

The only thing that might slow the change is society's reactions. I'm not anti-AI per se, but if people decide to boycott companies that say use AI generated ads, then humans will still have a say and use their power to try and slow things down. AI will become more and more influential and negatively affect many other sectors but there is still a battle to be had and the outcome should be one in which governments allow society time to adapt and figure out how we restructure our society and economy.

Right now, AIs don't function like a consciousness. They're like stagnant computers with millions of split identities that are confined to exist in between the prompts it's given.

In order for an AI to be conscious, it would need to be continuously stimulated by the outside world, and able to prompt itself. This definitely seems possible within the decade, but no large existing model has achieved this yet.",2024-02-16T23:35:16Z

It goes without saying that this footage is not just a collage and assembly of images. SORA understands what words are, what goes where, and why, and it has an advanced (arguably superintelligent) understanding of language and how it translates to reality.

I personally think we'll create it before 2030. An absurd amount of progress has happened in the past year, and researchers developing GPT-5 and Gemini 1.5 have already found a plethora of ways to make future models better.

It might not lead to apocalypse or a post-scarcity society, but I believe there will be a super-intelligent fully autonomous AI by 2030.",2024-02-17T01:39:00Z

Look, I am an AI enthusiast and really excited about everything AI but I refuse to think AI will completely replace artists. It may replace 95-99% of them, the average ones let's say, or even the good ones, but I want to believe the top 1%, the real geniuses, will not be replaced. I believe human experience and feelings are required to produce meaningful art, a machine can fake the style but can't produce something to that level. It can't write the Mozart's Kyrie of the Great Mass in C minor. I refuse to think it will ever will - maybe it's wishful thinking I know, but I would find it too depressing",2024-02-17T02:31:40Z

There is no doubt that AI i i is the biggest disputor to the digital marketing sector that we've all ever seen.  I predict that in the years ahead many so called digital marketing agencies will go out of businesss and disappear. Some of the larger much more well established agenices will still be around, those with very specialist niches and track records and blue chip clients..  And i also predict that a lot of small marketing consultants that deal with small businesses and SME's with turnover under £1m GBP will gradually more and more become AI consultants....  advising clients where to go, and which AI SaaS will be the best solution for their particular problem.  Its going DIY just like the travel did many years ago so that as we currently see, small businesses, solo-preneurs, SME's, even larger scale businesses/companies/organisations can find and pluck out specific  AI Software-as-a-Service platforms (SaaS) and just pay for the exact components they need, as opposed to paying a digital marketing agency XYZ Thousand pounds or dollars per month!

Everyone says it's a great opportunity and you have to take it so you don't get swept away. Okay, I can temporarily use AI to my advantage, but the problem is one: 
In a very short time the company will only need to write a prompt asking for a complete marketing strategy (I know what I'm talking about, being a marketing graduate).
I realize that AIs already know how to do this, but they need more time to create a truly comprehensive and effective one. Even Chat GPT 3.5 can create a buyer persona.

Why should a company pay a marketing team if a single AI can organize everything in seconds? It costs you less, doesn't ask for vacation time, doesn't ask for entitlements, monitors perfectly, and works around the clock.

You have to think and count to 1 million when the revolution knocks on the door, because it would only be an opportunity if we were evolved humans. Instead we are not, it is clear to everyone now.
Extreme capitalism and this mindless speed of our society have led to all of this: launching something as soon as possible to generate profit, without reasoning at all about the consequences.

We were stupid to make something smarter than we are, only most people don't realize it.
I remember the smartphone optimism: ""We'll all be smarter! We have human knowledge in our pockets."" 


The future is unemployment. And I hope with all my heart that I am wrong...I would only be happy.",2024-03-22T13:20:13Z

Originally intended to be the bridge between producers and consumers by making sure producers produce what the consumers want and to help producers and consumers meet   each other for satisfying their requirements has turned into a dangerous business function that seeks to influence consumers by playing with their emotions using dark tricks of psychology to make them buy things which they don't actually need by planting a desire to buy things by connecting them to beautiful experiences- which can totally exist without them buying.

With the advent of AI, it is only going to get worse. Every move of consumer is tracked, their thoughts analyzed, their behavior predicted and their choices influenced. AI automates this and it can get nasty when AI learns the same dark psychology tricks.

2023-12-13T19:00:28Z,@shafiqahmad786,3MwMII8n1qM,"The below notes are created using Bard tool :)

The speaker, Jessica Apotheker, is a marketer who is interested in the impact of generative AI on marketing.

She argues that generative AI will have a major impact on marketing, but that it is important for marketers to be prepared for this change.
One of the ways that generative AI will impact marketing is by automating many of the tasks that are currently done by humans. This will free up marketers to focus on more strategic work.
Another way that generative AI will impact marketing is by personalizing content to a much greater extent than is currently possible. This could lead to more effective marketing campaigns, but it could also lead to content overload for consumers.
Apotheker argues that the key to success in the age of AI is for marketers to develop a ""left AI brain"" in addition to their right AI brain. The left AI brain is responsible for data analysis and logic, while the right AI brain is responsible for creativity and intuition.
Apotheker also argues that it is important for marketers to protect their brand identity in the age of AI. This means being careful not to let AI generate content that is inconsistent with the brand's values.
Finally, Apotheker advises marketers to focus on what they are good at. If you are a creative person, then focus on developing your creative skills. If you are a data-driven person, then focus on developing your data analysis skills.

She mentions some repetitive things that might occur. She forgets that these problems are known now. 

Very soon an approach like AutoGPT for codint could very easily be adopted to an AutoMarketingGPT.

The LLM generating a dozen marketing texts for a given product. Creating variations of these text for certain demographics. 

Generate images for these texts, and variations of these images.

Want to be sure it comes up with new creative ideas? Make sure the tool automatically gets some randomizer. 

We don't even need new ideas for these issues. Some good solutions for a more flexible and ""creative"" result are already known.

And I agree with alot of users here. What she describes is at best a timeframe of 5-10 years. After that, even without an AGI, most ""white collar"" jobs are obsolete/ redundant.",2023-12-12T17:15:00Z

What she hinted at is a problem of oversaturation of advertisement, the similar generated personal ads even. The thing is, in such an environment there is no way humans will be needed as much as before AI obviously, just set up a small team of AI experts and this is all you need to spam-bang people's attention, there is no solution to the ""creativity"" or ""making ads look real and not simple or AI spam"", the ones who have better AIs will simply get more working ads based on personal and all data. It is really close, 1-2 years i'd say.

Don't think it's going to be a problem for consumers, just another example of AI replacing humans, and it's really frightening in a way we might be not ready for these changes yet, we need to develop a picture of how future society will look like at least, and making appropriate changes for this.",2023-12-20T12:13:31Z

01:07 🤖 Generative AI is set to revolutionize work productivity, especially in marketing, potentially impacting it by up to 50%.
02:13 🧠 Marketing has evolved from pure creativity to specialized skills; now, generative AI is fundamentally transforming core marketing activities.
03:19 📧 With generative AI, free time gained might not lead to less work but could mean a surge in more personalized content for consumers.
04:25 ⚠ Generative AI's reliance on existing data risks overwhelming consumers with repetitive, indistinguishable content, leading to content overload.
05:31 🧩 Organizations need to foster a ""left-AI brain,"" integrating predictive AI tools strategically while preserving and nurturing creative talent.
07:03 🌐 To avoid being limited by existing data, seek partnerships beyond direct competitors to access diverse data for better market segmentation.
08:35 🚫 Over-reliance on generative AI can stifle innovation and brand identity; identifying and protecting true innovators is crucial to maintain divergence of ideas.
09:36 👩‍🎨 Safeguard creative individuals from relying solely on AI; encourage them to use AI for inspiration but emphasize the human touch in generating original ideas.
