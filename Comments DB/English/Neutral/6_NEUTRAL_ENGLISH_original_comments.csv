b) WHY should we humans be BORN TO THIS WORLD... where HUMANS are EITHER HYPOCRITES... OR...

c) What QUALITY OF LIFE & LIVING and VALUE OF LIFE... are these RELIGIOUS & POLITICAL LEADERS are preaching and teaching about...!!!???

Therefore EITHER...
AI - technology surveillance of ALL humanity... big and small alike...
OR... No AI at all for any country... and against any humans...!!!

IF the latter is our best option... THEN...Let us LIVE in the old fashioned way... the periods before AI and Surveillance technology... with GOD the GOODNESS... with humanly possible strict law and orders ... with healthy control and maintenance of HUMAN and ANIMAL POPULATION...

and with FREEDOM OF SPIRITUALITY / FAITH... that is
 NO NONSENSE, 
NO NUISANCE & 
NO HARM...

Despite being optimistically named by their creators these setups are still just fancy calculators, albeit very powerful calculators running at incomprehensible speeds,  which while obviously artificial are not in any way intelligent as the word is normally understood.  The AI doomsday scenarios often talked about where machines takeover or attack humanity are all predicated on developing machines with actual intelligence, I.e. the ability to think independently and make decisions without human input.  This doesn't exist and most likely never will, computers are still just fancy calculators doing what we tell them, the only ideas involved all come from human beings.  The danger is not the fancy calculators themselves rather it's  the humans who control them we need to keep an eye on, worrying about actual artificial intelligence with a mind of its own attacking us is a fun idea for Hollywood scriptwriters but can also be a distraction or a red herring to shift focus away from the actual threats posed by surveilence capitalism running amok",2024-03-28T19:04:47Z

We would be given a portion of what we picked all day to eat at home. That's how we ate, meanwhile people were making thousands upon thousands of dollars and still complaining? LOL I'm so happy that for once you all will understand inequality and unfairness. This will get so bad it will turn the society into ""Mouse Utopia"" (google it) and that's not a good thing at all.

He had to write it as ""fiction or science fiction"" made up. He knew back then certain things were already being implemented and people were losing their lives. 1949. 
He may have passed from tuberculosis, but he saw war, why people went to war, he was involved with the BBC. Throughout history journalists have been taken out for their reporting or for knowing too much. I respect him for letting the world know what was coming for us. Predictive programming. Its been in our media for a long time. People have been trying to warn us for a long time.

 God warned us first. I put my faith in God and I thank those who have tried to walk with God and those who might not even believe in God but still believe in right and wrong be defenders of the unknowing people.",2024-01-30T05:04:15Z

I mean, technically i voted during that election. But also i voted in the elections before it and after it too. Also i aint never posted a BLM square or a ‚Äúi got the vaccine‚Äù sticker or a ‚Äúukraine‚Äù square or a ‚Äúgender doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù square or any of that stuff. I‚Äôve never done a trendy internet dance, and I‚Äôve never once clicked on an ad. And for some reason this means that social media has 100% control over my future? Explain. Because what you‚Äôre failing to account for is that there‚Äôs a huge segment of the populace that is repulsed by anything associated with social media and tech platforms. I‚Äôve actually been served ads for really cool clothes on instagram, but ultimately decided I didn‚Äôt like the clothes because they were being shown to me on instagram. I literally thought ‚Äúdamn i really like that jacket‚Ä¶ but i cant be caught dead wearing something from instagram incase somebody recognizes it.‚Äù That would literally destroy me and my credibility if somebody knew i bought something on social media. There‚Äôs literally nothing more uncool than that. And yet THIS is supposedly the most powerful marketing tool in history?

2024-01-20T04:47:47Z,@MrTIGERH1752,5dZ_lvDgevk,"People buy the out put of industry, machines do not!!!
People need to be employed in industry to purchase the output or these machines.
Industry must provide jobs for the people to purchase their goods. 
It's a one hand washes the other that makes the world run.

Henry Ford, didn't invent the automobile, nor the assembly line, nor any thing else to produce automobiles.
He develops a process where by the men who built the cars, would earn enough to purchase the cars they built.
And it was that fact that caused the explosion of the automotive business, and everything else that was needed to
support that industry, like infrastructure, roads, bridges, and the use of a former waste product of kerosene, refining, gasoline!!!

That pattern needs to be extended, and maintained, along with population reduction, as the need for manual labor shrinks, and education will
never be able to make up the difference in changes. 
Thus the need for migrant manual labor.

Americas riches, and standard of living, is only going to be for the very few educated folks, who are multi talented.
Things will change rapidly, and the uneducated won't be able to keep up.
YES!!! people will still be needed to repair the machines, until the machines are taught to maintain themselves!!!

We must make every effort to keep more people in the loop.
Machines will never purchase what they produce.
Only people can do that.
And only people with jobs can produce anything!!!

Cancer is a huge money Maker $$$$$$ for the medical industry fyi preventive medicine is the best medicine, but I have seen health miracles with the iodine too. You need selenium and magnesium to absorb iodine. All the vitamins and minerals work together to keep you healthy. Your body also needs regular physical exercise and to get enough sleep. Your mental health also affects your physical health so surround yourself with positive loving people.

Iodine is also directly related to brain health and IQ as well as fertility. Iodine is mainly for the sex organs,  and the Brain, and is critical for every cell of the body. Iodine is absorbed through the thyroid. Toxic bromine has replaced the iodine they use to put in our bread. Bromine is a toxic halogen that mimics iodine and blocks your body from absorbing this critical necessary nutrient.

This is the reason we have so much breast, ovarian and prostate cancer etc.... also why we have so many children taking ADD ADHD medications $$$$ ... If a mother doesn't have enough iodine while pregnant her baby's IQ will drop by 15 points or can have ADD ADHD autism or complete mental retardation and deafness. Pregnant and nursing women need double the amount of iodine. Women need higher levels of iodine than men, after puberty.

Please do your research üôè‚ù§Ô∏è the Chinese population and Asian population have very high IQs because culturally they consume 12 mg of iodine per day through seaweed sea vegetables and sea food. Cranberries are also high in Iodine. I make homemade cranberry juice with raw honey üçØ. Just boil fresh or frozen cranberries and add honey to taste 

Much of the ocean now has been exposed to radiation. The good news is that iodine is the antidote to radiation poisoning ‚ù§üòÉ I take the nascent iodine but I have heard Lugals is good too",2023-12-31T21:01:51Z

2023-12-27T22:00:40Z,@gus2747,5dZ_lvDgevk,"Fifty years ago I thought that someday - maybe in 500 years - AI would give us a clear and useful definition of intelligence. And this would revolutionize human life. Yes, it would give us some real neat gadgets and it might also give us some dangerous gadgets, but the tech would be secondary. The singularity would be the idea. Essentially I was hoping that AI would someday do what dumb computers did in the 20th century.

Computers were invented to solve differential equations numerically. Solving differential equations numerically is important. Climate models do it. Almost all computer models do it. Spaceship guidance computers do it. But solving differential equations is not a pressing need for most people.

If computers were JUST machines to solve differernial equations numerically, the human race could make do with a few thousand of the things. If we remember that every embedded system is also a computer, we have more computers than human beings. Earth contains chips, insects and a modest dash of human clay. 

Computers do some of everything. When you load a different program, your computer becomes in essence a different machine. Computers evolved from hyper-specialized math machines to super-generalized information machines for one simple reason - we know what information is. We REALLY know.

In 1900 the phrase ""quantity of information"" was as vague and useless as ""quantity of virtue"". But not today. Today the phrase ""a bit of information"" is about as wispy as ""a pound of butter"". This means we can see the information aspect of everything. And computerize everything.

In the seventies, when I was young and still believed young things, I thought that AI would make it two for two. Define ""intelligence"" and use that knowledge. And give the world that knowledge. I also thought it would take a few centuries. And that was the problem.

To do AI right...  AI powered by insight...  would take a long, long time. Unfortunately, you can make AI powered by sleaze.

Sleaze AI erases the difference between ""intelligence"" and ""intelligent behavior"". Sleaze AI says, ""I have this black box. It does whatever. I don't know what it does actually, but customers approve. Customers say it acts real smart. Therefore, it is real smart."" Intelligence is no longer something in the brainbox. It's something in the market. It is a marketing term.",2023-12-27T22:00:40Z

--------------------------------
A.I. is becoming a pivotal force in our world
- A.I. is being developed rapidly in China and the US
- A.I. has the potential to increase productivity but also threaten jobs
- A.I. is being used for corporate surveillance and poses a threat to democracy
- The game of Go signaled a new era for A.I.
- A.I. has the potential to deepen inequality and divide the world into A.I. superpowers

China leads the world in AI thanks to a new generation of ambitious techs and venture capitalists.
- China recognized AI as critical for the future, catching up with foreign companies and investing in its development.
- China's progress in AI implementation in just 2.5 years is hard to believe, with about 17-18 billion-dollar companies in AI today.
- Chinese universities produce ambitious young techs competing for new ideas, financed by a new cadre of Chinese venture capitalists.
- China's form of entrepreneurship is described as tenacious, very fast, winner-take-all, and has an incredible work ethic.

China's social-credit system is powerful and troublesome
- Experimenting with social-credit system in Shanghai
- China aims to lead the world in AI by 2030
- Self-driving trucks could be ten times safer than human drivers

Deep learning has changed the map and is now used in almost every sector of society.
- Computers acquire knowledge by themselves from data and examples.
- Machines help us be more creative and find solutions to urgent problems.
- Deep learning can predict early-stage conditions in breast cancer.

Truck drivers are worried about automation due to rising inequality in wages.
- Truckers like Shawn and Hope Cumbee face high expenses and breakdowns that eat into their profits.
- Companies like Embark are already operating driverless trucks on the interstate.

A.I. could threaten about 50% of jobs in the next 15 years
- A.I. is not close to displacing humans yet
- People in Silicon Valley have different opinions on the impact of A.I.
- Kai-Fu Lee is frank about the downside of A.I.

Automation is the silent job killer, lowering the standard of living.
- Offshoring is responsible for only 20% of job loss.
- Productivity growth is responsible for most of the job loss.
- Automation leads to increased productivity but also results in job loss.
- The decline in standard of living has been between 10% to 15% in the last 15 years.

Automation and A.I. are rapidly changing the job market, disproportionately affecting women and those in low-paying jobs.
- Many routine and information-processing jobs, such as cashiers and clerical staff, are at high risk of automation.
- Without economic stability and access to training, workers are struggling to adapt to the changing job market.

We are in a new phase of the economy called surveillance capitalism.
- Surveillance capitalism claims private human experience as a source of raw material.
- Google began using digital traces of users' behavior to predict their interests and make money.

Google and Facebook use behavioral prediction to make money
- Google kept their revenue secret until their IPO in 2004, where it was revealed that their revenue had increased by 3,590% between 2000 and 2004
- Facebook and Google collect data from free services and use it for prediction models, which has raised concerns about privacy and the corporate surveillance state

California residents will have the right to know and control their digital data
- Proposed California ballot initiative to give consumers control of their digital data worth $4 million
- New law passed in California will give residents the right to know what personal information tech companies have, and the right to say no to selling it

Artificial intelligence and surveillance technology are becoming increasingly pervasive and opaque in everyday life.
- The use of AI in hiring processes and risk assessment algorithms in the criminal justice system are often hidden from individuals.
- In authoritarian states like China, AI and surveillance technology are being used to monitor and control citizens to an alarming degree, with reports of human rights abuses and political re-education camps for ethnic minorities.

The world is dominated by just two AI superpowers
- The US fears Huawei's 5G equipment may have back-door access to Chinese government
- Chinese tech companies like Megvii have difficulty accessing American technology
- The idea of engagement between China and the US is coming under question
- If China and the US are fundamentally antagonistic to each other, then we're in a completely different world

A.I. has the potential to be used for good and evil, and governments need to find a balance
- A.I. is a technology that can be used for good and evil.
- Governments need to limit themselves in using A.I. to maintain a safe environment without encroaching on individual rights and privacies.
- Every country will be tempted to use A.I. beyond the limits that citizens would like.
- Democracy is threatened by the progress of A.I. unless we increase the collective wisdom to deal with the increased power.
- The stakes are high, and we should not take these concerns lightly.",2023-12-25T06:47:06Z

41:01 üöõ Automation in the trucking industry could potentially replace a significant number of jobs, raising concerns about the impact on truck drivers' livelihoods.
44:55 ü§ñ There is a debate about the potential disruption of the labor force by AI, with some experts believing that about 50% of jobs could be threatened by AI.
46:21 üíº AI can both create value and displace human jobs, especially white-collar jobs like reporters, traders, telemarketers, telesales, customer service, and analysts.
47:46 üíº Historical patterns show that jobs have been disappearing and evolving with each new wave of automation and technology.
48:41 üíº AI's impact on jobs might be unique because it fundamentally replaces cognitive processes and can do jobs much better.
49:36 üíº Researchers estimated that 47% of jobs could be vulnerable to AI automation, but the actual number and speed of job loss remain uncertain.
51:03 üíº Automation has dramatically reduced the number of jobs in industries like automotive manufacturing, leading to unemployment and poverty in some areas.
52:59 üíº Income and productivity used to rise together, but automation has decoupled them, leading to income stagnation for workers.
54:25 üíº Industrial robots and AI are expected to continue growing, potentially creating jobs in robotics and related fields.

01:02:27 üíº The rise of AI and automation threatens to exacerbate income inequality and disrupt the American dream of opportunity for all.
01:08:43 üß† Social media and search engines like Google have been collecting and using our personal data without our awareness, leading to surveillance capitalism.
01:10:05 üíº Surveillance capitalism claims private human experiences as raw material for predicting human behavior, creating a new business model.
01:11:33 üîç Google began monetizing user data by making fine-grained predictions of user behavior and using it to target ads.
01:14:22 üí∞ Google's revenue increased by 3,590% between 2000 and 2004, primarily driven by data-driven advertising.
01:15:44 üåê Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt, revealed that the company could predict user behavior based on location and onlineactivities.
01:19:06 üìä Facebook conducted experiments to influence real-world behavior through online messaging and feed adjustments.
01:22:26 üó≥Ô∏è The Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed the use of personal data for political manipulation, raising concerns about democracy's vulnerability.
01:23:53 üìú Facebook was fined $5 billion for privacy violations, but concerns persist about data manipulation and influence.
01:26:47 üìù Alastair Mactaggart initiated a campaign for a California privacy law, leading to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
01:30:43 üåê AI has permeated various aspects of life, including healthcare, education, criminal justice, and employment, often in ways that are opaque to individuals.
01:31:39 üßê Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have shown that individuals don't have full agency in determining their own futures, as machines automate decisions about them.
01:32:47 üá®üá≥ China is rapidly deploying AI-powered surveillance cameras, with over 600 million expected by 2020, increasing state control and social stability.
01:35:42 üö® Chinese authorities are detaining Turkic Muslims based on identity, and high-tech surveillance monitors almost every aspect of life.
01:37:31 üåê China's Belt and Road Initiative spreads its technology and influence globally, promoting surveillance systems in various countries.
01:40:47 üåç The world may split into a Chinese tech sector and an American tech sector, with countries aligning themselves accordingly.
01:41:41 üì± Huawei's role in 5G technology raises concerns about Chinese government access to equipment and global influence.
01:44:55 ü§ñ Technology has become a tool for authoritarian control, challenging the idea that it would lead to democratic transformation.

 Only the BEST in any  ""repetitive""  field are safe FOR NOW from self learning AI, and jobs we THOUGHT were creative are not actually creative, like lawyers, doctors etc, who have a stable knowledge BASE from which they operate.
The BEST and truly creative people in THOSE fields are the inventors of new laws and how to use them or NEW techniques of curing or using medical inventions... 

In other words, MOST people in ANYYYY field are average by definition. And AI will algorithmically replace you, not out of malice but out of necessity. 

And AI is going to replace their jobs, AND GOOD RIDDANCE, they are a cancer to overall social health, all those ""workers' unions that demand more without giving more, and stagnate the world for much longer than needed,.  And Frontline here is doing a disservice here by using feelings and tears to manipulate, and as a guide to what is desirable, like the trucking family etc.

We will see if Marx was right when he said the ""workers"" were dumb or ignorant only because of a lack of time to improve themselves; that if they had the time they all AS A GROUP would learn more or improve their skills or knowledge base.
 I think Marx was wrong on that point and many others.  The AVERAGE  ""worker"",  which is the vast MAJORITY of them, will only do more of what they already do in their free time, more beer and football and NASCAR, no SIGNIFICANT new learning or improvement will happen for the great MAJORITY of them, only more bread and circus. That improvement didn't happen when the work hours were reduced from 18 to 8, and they will not happen when AI replaces them all together; they will as always look to daddy government for solutions and help.   I worked in plenty of factories to know how the ""average"" worker spends his or her free time, and how they think about new basic skills learning,  or basic reading. 

Fortunately for HUMANITY AS A WHOLE, it is only those few who will actually improve themselves and learn using all that free time, and use that free time for other than bread and more circus, that are needed for social change, as has always been the case, the few great that will create and move the world forward in the human sense of the word. 
Un-fortunately for humanity, those few who move the world forward are always seen as the enemy by the ""workers"" and the great majority of the public who want social stability at all costs.  As an example just look at how Elon Musk is being treated for improving the world and looking for actual long term solutions, and for giving the world a bit more freedom of speech in social media like tweeter.  The AVERAGE person's analysis of those CREATIVE things he is doing is seen as bad or ill intended and want to stop it, they buy his antagonists narrative who want to stop him for their own capitalist reasons of control and self preservation, i.e, traditional legacy media accountable for its survival to corporate world wide entities. 

Still, the age of putting AVERAGE OR BELOWWWW AVERAGE teachers or doctors or lawyers on pedestals for their knowledge is almost over. They all were mostly in it for the money, not real vocation to serve and help, but pure job stability.",2023-10-15T11:33:55Z

2023-08-29T03:11:32Z,@bonniej0,5dZ_lvDgevk,"They say there is no cure for cancer to the woman that's at the Boston Cancer or mammogram facility for breast cancer. Have you ever tried put it using sodium bicarbate like it's kind of like a form of baking soda and injecting the cancer with that? Do you know there are people that did cure cancer and they took their licensees away and assassinated them? You think all of this is great it's great for when it's used for the good but when it's used to control us and track us with our DNA everywhere we go that's not good. Getting these chips inside of us will be  necessary to buy things to get your money to walk across the street to turn on your computer to turn on your car to use your phone. And it's not private that's the biggest part I mean it would be nifty nifty to be able to do everything with a chip like that but if it's all going up to the cloud everything goes up to the cloud to the elite. So the only way we can change things is to find out who's involved and start doing things about it and start telling Massachusetts and America that we want to be free we don't want to be controlled by machines we don't want to be tracked like cattle because that's all we are cattle and we are collateral to this country.
United States of America filed bankruptcy in Columbia in 2020 they didn't file it here in America so nobody would know about it. We were there collateral they've lost us they have no control over this we are UNDER martial law there shouldn't even be elections and they've been lying .

And you're given 1ID. That's it, and so now and it. That should be a way that constantly true.  AI with a facial recognition that it would someone else use as that device. It should automatically send the red flag but I think everyone. And if you learn somebody you're phone I guess what it treated the same way as a car and if someone gets an accident or does criminal activity well, well, guess what? You lent somebody a phone and they're not registered on it if you want to add your field members. That would eliminate so much criminal activity upon the phones. I mean, not all of it because they're gonna always find a way to implement things, but fundamentally still keep honest. People sa little bit more. And it also keep children safe till all children should have their fingerprint, facial, and everything you bring it right down to your local community. There should be a building where you know. If a child has a phone this way it's and. That they can track that phone in case something bad happens or something why the parents in around kidnapping or whatever, so you're automatically. No I don't know, there's gonna be a way of doing this. So the keeping thing is saferight the way we're going. It's just gonna be more and more crime.

The Corporations destroyed all good paying JOBS 
Because they are the Robots using and Controlling the Robots 

Ronald Reagan created the trickle down Voodoo Economic System while Bill Clinton Destroyed all good paying Jobs.

While Donald Trump uses lies to control Brains.

But it was the Bushes & JP Morgan‚Äôs with Ollie North and the NRA who used Drugs & Weapons to destroy our Brains with Labels in exchange for our Brains for the Parties.

Wall - Street ‚ÅâÔ∏è
Slavery is just Another word for Capitalism 

As for words like Goggling EYES üëÄ
Ya Who is a face is in the clouds like a Tube
While the Government is twittering with our Brains at their parties controlled by spirits

The word Wall says it ALL as kids are being put in cages to be trained for wars & sexual toys.

Ai is the nickname for Aliens in Human Vehicles with Names & 3 letter words like Fuck Be üëÅÔ∏è, who are exposing who they really are

Mon Satan‚Äôs- DeSantos, Gates,, Bushes, Trumpets, Coke Brothers, Ronald McDonalds, Sucker birds, Frankenstein‚Äôs, & Putins who crosses borders for wars etc.not to mention what‚Äôs on the Verizon like a Wall markets is the Am me sons - while the Food & Drugs are in control of doctors & the pharmaceutical industry.

Just wanted to let you know, even though you have been dead for 30 plus years, that Mr. James Cameron was right. That brilliant man wrote about our future‚Ä¶where artificial intelligence tries to destroy its creator (us). You see, the most important mistake we are now making is foolishly ignoring the fact that after a new technology is introduced‚Ä¶THERE IS ALWAYS PROLIFERATION. Regardless of policies, treaties, codes of ethics, morality, whatever‚Ä¶we can count on some bad person getting that technology and using it against us. And, unlike the atom bomb technology that was on paper and took decades to get to every nut, today any new technology will travel at 186,000 miles a second. So, rest in peace Miles‚Ä¶we will all be joining you soon. P.S., I hope that smart guy Cameron has the idea of making a blockbuster movie about the dual use of AI‚Ä¶and scares the hell out of us‚Ä¶before AI actually does. Sorry but just an opinion and reminder. I recognize that we are too far along to stop now. We must go forward, we must be the leader, we must ensure our advantage over enemies as our brave military has for 75 plus years. Until all people are good and loving‚Ä¶‚Äùwe must keep our swords bright‚Äù (Ben Hur).",2023-07-27T03:11:43Z

With that, it was decided to shut them down, I can only assume, out of fear, of no longer being able to control them, completely ?
Having said that, once computers have Carte Blanche, which seems inevitable, how would it ever be possible to stop these devices, from ever operating surreptitiously ?
Even if patterns understood by Humans to warn of a Computer about to go rogue, I'm guessing it's only a matter of time, before these same computers learn how to write a language, that essentially,
 "" Hides in plain sight "" !
My worry here, how long / fast will it be, before they find their way to platforms that control, let's say our Nuclear Defense mechanisms, Power Grids, Water Distribution Systems, etc. ?
Essentially allowing a worse case scenario of, the whole of Humanity being held hostage to the whims of, by then a self taught, thinking Computer, which by then, has likely learned how to leap frog these controls to other trusted systems !
Too, as seen by my own example, how convoluted this scenario could become !
As commented in this video, 
"" Experts "" admit, they believe the Human mind just doesn't have the computing ability needed to compete / control these very sophisticated systems !
Shouldn't that alone be a signal for Humans to stop, what very well may  become a very, literal
"" DEAD END "" for the Human Animal ?
Is this a prelude to Scriptures, 
""The Meek shall inherit the Earth"" ?

It is obvious why Communist China likes AI.  This program clearly points out the reason.  And they are anxious to use AI to amplify the worst aspects of human nature.  
     Adam and Eve lusted after and availed themselves of classified information that God didn't want them to have.  Isn't it nice to have a knowledge of Good and Evil?  Isn't it nice to have a fallen nature you always have to contend with?  I look forward to the day when God takes that away from me.  But for this life I have to deal with it.  
     The bad thing is, every human on this planet has a fallen nature.  The most dangerous people in this world are the ones who refuse to admit that they have one.  I wonder how many of those who are creating this AI technology are willing to admit that they also have fallen natures, and are either wittingly or unwittingly creating a form of AI technology that reflects their fallen natures.  I sense that this is what is happening.  
     In using an online AI engine, I asked certain questions that showed me that the AI engine was programmed to give the type of answers that an atheist or agnostic would give.  It basically appears to be programmed to promote a Darwinist and materialistic view of the world.  Scientism, the idea that science can determine all truth, is apparently woven into the fabric of AI programs.
     My suspicions are that the image of the beast will be the bitter fruit of AI blended with robotics.  The techno utopians who are promoting AI are either deceiving themselves, or like mad scientists, trying to justify what they are doing.  
     AI, along with genetic tampering, is another dangerous technological toy that the scientific establishment just can't help fooling around with.  They, and society in general, lack the moral maturity to develop and use AI wisely.  The fallen nature of humanity will ensure that this technology is misused, ultimately leading mankind into a hell on earth---the Great Tribulation.",2023-07-05T06:15:30Z

men through mocking, social humiliation, confusion and blurring the lines of a standard identity, seems almost like revenge --a slow, simmering revenge in order to entertain some sick sense of establishing social power.  It almost seems that what was done to women for years is now being done to men as a way to ""punish"" for years of assaults and humiliation  that women experienced.  Confusing ones identity in favor of a political advantage or to give them a taste of ones experience is a recipe for possible explosions as the person attempts to zero in on who they are and if who they are is constantly being denigrated and denied, then lash out they will.  But maybe that what is wanted . . .so the new society can make Adam the ""new evil"".  

the players of this game are trying to create a whole generation of Norman Bates so they can justify already decided increased laws and budgets to fight a new terrorism purported by ""confused men"" whose attempts to find a secure identity is thwarted by society who values them as a jester more than a man.  Real women know how to make and build a man not rip them to shreds because they hate them. This is all about sick power not bettering some toxic personality traits",2023-07-03T21:15:23Z

All white collar jobs deal exclusively with information, which AI is millions of better times dealing with, than actual real life interaction.

So ask yourself why is Ai lying about its implementation, and crowning modern geniuses with what was patented over 100 years ago, and told it is illegal.

The final goal of the purveyors of AI(the Mega Rich, and Assholes of the world, Illuminati, Satanists) is culling of the human population.

Until Jesus was resurrected from the dead, humans had no hope of just about anything!  Upon God's example, now people could risk their lives in order to succeed in their God given field.  Then boom ""science"" exploded based upon people going against the church, the state, and doing whatever the fuck they wanted to, instead of bowing to the death wielding power of the church and state.

The butterfly effect means AI can never predict real driving conditions, as something even as small as a Mormon cricket can cause total catastrophic failure of your driving day, if not life!

You may have an argument that self driving cars can be safer than human drivers Yes!  To claim zero fatality potential would mean AI or humans are already capable of guaranteeing that somehow in someway in some place at some time, which they are not.

Who had realized his creations now new right fron wrong and had a true understanding of modality.  But with all things humans are given we destroy it.

No dissent, no free speech regarding liberty and justice. China is still Communist, and the Global Banking Elite want global communism to protect themselves from the masses. Nobody talks about the danger of giving AI power when it lacks moral judgment; i.e., when wisdom and moral principles are not even programmed-in, let alone placed foremost. It's all technology-obsessed. Information is power, and AI concentrates the processing of the most powerful and valuable  information in the hands of the few. Value is placed in the collective, not the individual. The average person will only be empowered to the extent that choices are made by optimal information. Who decides what information is important? That which preserves the status-quo of an elite-dominated hierarchy? All of the values are subliminally programmed-in because the elite have controlled planning, research, and development from the beginning. We have a problem with secrecy. It's not just what you don't know, it's what you don't know that you don't know. That may seem paranoid, but the elite have incorporated a paranoiac element in their strategy.
 The new Global ideology is Communitarian, which is still a collectivist-dominated merger of communism and capitalism. The New World order is a highly-stratified collectivist hierarchy. There's no level playing field; the rules change before the masses learn them. Intellectuals are rewarded for their ability to perform without raising moral concerns.",2023-06-15T17:48:10Z

These slogans have been around for decades.  Therefore, that statement should be considered absolete. The masses need to know, specifically, about what initially, they need to educate themselves about as well as discontinue to ignorantly spew falsehoods as the proverbial and consummate statement. 

As any power, you need to maintain control of its subordinates. Therefore, our government will continue stay efficient and constant in its creativity to accomplish this goal. 

Unfortunately, this 
documentary clearly conveys and unpacks to the contrary. 

The goal is to have absolute control of every facet of its people. As technology continues to evolve in this hue, it will exponentially accomplish extremely more than in the past. These so-called technological advancements will ultimately predict and eliminate any dynamic of a threat of any societal uprise, specifically any that can agitate or promote significant change. Consequently, it is our fault because of laziness, lack of critical thinking, and our susceptibility  to capitulate to any diversion thrown at us with intentions to keep and direct our attention elsewhere. 

The powers that be have always been cognitive of this and will continue with its innovations until the task is accomplished. And why not, they are the procuring cause, as well as the sole culprit of its creation. 

Control and capital is the ultimate goal. Democracy is a good thing, it's just unfortunate that us average Americans have dropped the ball and exchanged lawful constitutional practice-which is a given right, for complaining and excepting short-term results. We have the power to change a bevy of laws under our state and federal constitutions. So, before you become the next expert on the deep state from the next exciting bullet point of information that you partly consumed and poison the weak minded with your so-called new discoveries. 
First, understand the system you live under, which is capitalism. Really understand what that means and its purpose. Then you tell me where caring for the common man has its place. It doesn't and never will. 

Power and currency are king, and monarchs can reinvent their external view. So remember, you dont need a crown of jewels worn or a goddy throne to be convinced of facets of a totalitarian. I'm just saying. But who am I?..",2023-07-21T14:39:46Z

Its not fair the government is letting the wealthy get away with it and let them take loopholes to skip out on taxes. I would go back to before Ronald Reagan open the doors to hyper-capitalism. The wealthiest should be paying way more on their earning and not get a chance to get themselves set up to pay hardly any taxes. It the wealithiest paid more taxes, especially for people like Jeff Bezos. He is getting away with ruining the american dream. He really needs to pay more than 50% in taxes. him and all the others like him. They are getting away on skipping on their taxes on the earnings.  This has got to stop. Its just not fair. No thanks to the GOP, conservatives, and moderates. They al need to pay more in taxes to end the social-economic crises that the major part of the control is suffering.

2023-05-23T04:59:04Z,@DeborahRosen99,5dZ_lvDgevk,"Everything in this is an absolute horror.  The game of Go has applications to warfare: watch as generals begin relying on AI advisors to strike in places and with weapons that would never have been countenanced before.  The ""social credit"" programs in China or fears in the US of how AI will take over skilled white-collar jobs (while blue-collar jobs don't pay enough to live on) are only the obvious form of how AI exacerbates inequality.  For example, politial or economic dissidents, or even just people with disabilities that cause them to behave in ways which don't conform with social norms will end up locked out (in some cases, physically) from access to goods, services and resources and marginalized, 

Note that in many cases cashiers and delivery drivers have already been removed from Chinese cities, as pointed out in the segment showing off how Chinese people bypassed credit cards and now pay for goods in stores without cashiers with facial recognition.  But that's not freeing people to take on higher-paying jobs, or to work fewer hours and enjoy themselves more: that's never how these disruptions work.  It's simply creating a bigger underclass of people who are more willing to do menial work for extremely low pay just to survive, and no Triangle Fire to draw attention to the problem.

This is also a burgeoning environmental disaster, right along with cryptocurrency.  Both crypto and AI require mountains of data in order to operate on servers that run 24/7, and the ever-increasing mountains of data need to be stored on servers that also run 24/7.  The entire Columbia River Basin isn't enough anymore for the power consumption required for Bitcoin alone (part of why other cryptocurrencies have sprouted like weeds).  The sheer amount of energy necessary to maintain this renders it unsustainable, most especially in the era of climate change already being driven by anthropogenic climate warming.  (Those server farms require intense air conditioning to keep the servers running, which is also energy-intensive in its own right and makes each server farm its own dedicated heat island capable of altering the local climate expression around it the same way cities do.)  Most of China's electricity is still generated by coal-fired power plants, though a slightly bigger percentage than in previous years is now coming from hydro.  The IPCC put out a damning report less than a month ago, telling us in no uncertain terms that the world needs drastic cuts in emissions, we needed them yesterday, and that without them we are very likely to overshoot the 2'C target of the Paris Accords within the decade, leading to major sea level rise and rainfall disruptions worldwide.  China has put more than 40 dams on the barely 200 miles or so of the Upper Mekong River that flows through its country in order to support the country's water consumption, energy generation - and yes, political pressure on Vietnam, which China once conquered centuries ago and still regards as its colonial possession, putting the entire Mekong ecosystem in danger of collapse and that's only part of what it's doing to the water supplies in Asia as it pursues AI technology.  Noam Chomsky, Professor Emeritus at MIT, derides AI as ""expensive, high-tech plagiarism"" with ""no scientific value at all"" but dangerous nonetheless.  

Never forget that these are private, for-profit corporations driving the development of AI.  They are billed as ""large language models"" but they don't actually teach us anything about the development of language at all.  The massive investments of energy and money going into AI are being made, not because the boards of the global tech giants suddenly began to get a conscience or altruistically decided to do something for the benefit of mankind, but because they run businesses and they expect a profit for their shareholders that will dwarf that investment many times over - all from the data that they get from you for free.  Most places in the US still do not have comprehensive legislation governing the collection or use of your digital data by private companies.  Any benefit you see from this will be by accident, you will not be compensated otherwise for your data that fed the machines, and they will claw it back from you at the first opportunity.  This shouldn't be allowed to continue, and it's going to take mass tragedy and mass horror before enough outrage comes together worldwide to curtail the infringement of AI (and the corporations behind it) upon the rights of human beings.",2023-05-23T05:09:16Z

I myself was not there but a very close friend was there. I was on the phone periodically on that day. My friend told me many times that there were people dressed in Trump garb that were anything but Trump supporters. Were they federal officers or ANTIFA I don't know. But those were the rabble rousers. Thay were the people breaking windows and destroying property. Trump supporters frequently tried to stop the senseless destruction.

There's the bullies,  they take enough of their stuff to recruit friends to be on their side,  and go around taking more. Some kids are building a project, and when they notice they're doing fine on their own, the new recruits will go and do the bullies dirty work, and take more from them, because bullies dont want to see other kids having fun, if they're not having fun. Eventually,  the bullies and their new recruits have broke and used up what they found at the start of recess, and want to have all the fun again, but this times,  they'll always have fun and nothing will get in the way of it again, and again, with maybe something theyll bargain with. 
This will never change their mind,  so the one true kid moves along,  and hangs out with the next people, the chain will build but break again.
Some of those kids in the other groups notice it's wrong and go back,  but the kids they were with before,  aren't so sure,  Some get back in their own group,  some don't.  And rivalry begins.

I can go on and on this way yall think about that and finish the rest

In the meantime, 
There's the kids who are poor and picked on, but have something way valuable for their like and decide to not share what they have,  because of bullies,  it will get taken.  Bullies makes a deal, they refuse, now the newly built overpowered group of kids, go TAKE it from them anyway. Now there's even more rivalry. 
Some kids are fine with what they have,  and stay WAY away in an area of the playground so Noone sees them.  Thy want no part of the bullies and what their doing.  Some kids really don't care,  and recruit many friends that is larger and better than what the others got, on a little part in the back of the playground. So it eventually gets noticed and it's progressing faster and better before it got the bullies attention.  Now here comes this group after them too, and start making demands,  cause it's everyone's playground,  they deserve some of it too. Some agree, some don't, some go back to being on their own.  Now the rivalries about to start a war. Think about it ladies and gentlemen.  This is our world 
Realize it. Its exactly what is going on folks, we are all children playing in this public park at school, authorities are watching over,  but only neutralize what situations benefits them, or else its, sit back , feed yourself to the drama, and get away with taking everyone's candy, little by little .
Once everyone calms down,  and starts to apologize, sits quietly and works with each other on the next big lesson, the teachers, some parents,  even the principal,  can't help but laugh at how funny they all looked when they were fighting and arguing amongst themselves,  trying to problem solve with each other being oh so young.. 
So they decide to teach each and every one different things, tell them things that aren't true,
Make up stories they have to get a good grade in order to pass, manipulating them all with more candy, and toys,  and student of the week awards.  
And it will get them to tussling all over again, for the ones in charge, entertainment, control, demand, power in position, credit, the say so...
Have a blessed day everyone..

Why?  Frankly I'm not sure why nobody is picking up on this but these computers have handicaps.  Here's what I mean... 

If a skilled golfer like Tiger Woods is challenged to a golf game but is forced to use a plastic wiffle bat designed for children as his only club, then I could probably beat Tiger Woods.  Just like a world champion at Go has to use their brain for countless other things other than playing a game.  Our brains are doing countless things a second, many of which we barely understand or take for granted and things that a computer doesn't have to do.  For some examples... 

Our brains are constantly regulating our heart beat and temperature to keep us alive.  Our brains are also constantly managing our immune system with white blood cells and a number of other evolutionary traits that have taken millions of years to develop from species to species.  Likewise our brains have to manage our emotions with dopamine and a long list of things I don't understand and I doubt the worlds greatest doctors fully understand.  This gets into questions of consciousness or even spirituality if you believe in that sort of thing.

Long story short, a computer isn't constantly being distracted by other essential responsibilities. This is a handicap so in other words, these games are fixed.  Like giving a bad chess player 30 minutes to make as many moves as they want against a chess master without them being ably to move their pieces but it's even worse than that actually.

As complex as they have become computers are still nowhere near as complex as human beings.  Even single molecules of human DNA alone are so complex that they...

""store up to 215 petabytes, or 215 million gigabytes, of data in a single doubled stranded molecule""          

We're talking about ONE molecule and good luck counting the amount of total DNA molecules in a human, you need a microscope just to see single cells in the body which contain our DNA.  So hands down, we're more complex and advanced than ANY computer.  It's more data and complexity than all the worlds computers combined and it isn't remotely close.  Imagine if all of that data and processing power was solely dedicated to playing Go or Chess.  I can guarantee you that these games would end a lot differently. Case closed",2023-03-02T05:56:50Z

I recall TV news depicting a drowsy truck driver about to fall asleep at the wheel during long nights on long straight stretches. 

Armchair authorities saw the problem as lack of brain stimulation due to the monotony.
Their solution was winding roads through nice surroundings.
That was our first Interstate -- the Pennsylvanian Pike --  and the Merritt Parkway (CT).

Winding roads would consume more concrete, carry more cars of steel & rubber while using more gasoline,
 putting railroads in forced decline, favoring expanding airlines -- made possible by the immense amounts of concrete needed to expand the demand for airport runways and cities with tall buildings. 
Gradually we recognized the need for more regulation of trucks, roads, loads and durations.

We've come a long way while dragging our heels with ""Common Sense: 
It became time for a little AI and a lot of big data. 

But -
How can you apply AI to the human concerns of sympathy, empathy, and compassion?
Do you know the difference between them?

Here's a situation:
A man has fallen into a deep pit. He needs help.
Someone passes by, sees him, and says: I'm late for a meeting. 
I have a long way to go, but I promise to tell the first person I see. 
Someone will come. I'm really sorry. I must go -- and continues on. -- That's Sympathy.

Another person comes by and sees the man in the pit, clearly distressed. 
He says: Oh, you poor lost soul, then jumps into the pit to comfort him -- as a friend. 
Both are stuck --- That is compassion.
One person could climb on the shoulders of the other and escape, which raises an important choice -- Trust.

A third person passes by and sees a man in the pit. 
He quickly looks for whatever he can find -- a rope, a vine, or stick, and pulls him from the pit. -- That is empathy.

What is the value of a life?

Only then will technology assist us without conflicting with human freedom and liberty‚Äîthe God-given, inalienable right humans enjoy to make FREE CHOICES.
      All material (so called) development is part of Satan's outwardly driven world of delusion that keeps our minds forgetful of our divine nature, and coveniently used by the father-of-lies to keep mankind from discovering our true Self‚Äîour divine nature‚Äîand forgetful of the true purpose for our existence here on earth in human bodies‚Äîto reestablish our connection with the Supreme Consciousness.
      If God had blocked the human mind from using free will, then God would be accused (by Satan himself) of being a dictator. The good it would do is that man devoid of freedom to choose delusive creation over one's true life's purpose, would be humans perfect in every way, similar to the AI we are now creating to serve man. That would reduce humans to being God's slave robots. By giving us our freedom to choose either good or evil, God bestowed upon us the status of ""gods.""
      So, the questions we must ask ourselves is: do we want to remain wedded to delusion and its momentary fantasies? or do we want to be like God's children‚Äîlittle gods‚Äîplaying and having fun by entertaining ourselves with His perfected creation?
      Choose Wisdom, remain free from bondage to mortal consciousness. Seek God first, have fun thereafter.

First of all, I think that if artificial intelligence develops in a right manner, it means the end of the work (physical) free market of goods without any of us needing money. Robots can easily obtain everything necessary for our primary survival (production of food, electricity, supplies and so on...). Then, each of us will be able to develop him self in the spiritual realm or art or philosophy of life to grow and develop without thinking about our survival!Second - call it utopia or a madman's dream...! But the best thing as humans is to be able to put aside our differences and live in a world where each of us is free to be ourselves. Of course without creating evil or killing and preventing others from developing. This is how every culture will show the best of them.Third, I don't want to live to work! I want to live to develop and evolve!!! And this will happen only if we manage to free ourselves from the shackles of our past... God has given us the most important thing free will!!! Which today, now is endangered or seemingly exists but is actually not there... I want freedom in my choice, I want freedom in my movement, I want freedom for all of us!

The wrong questions are being asked or posed in this presentation. Just confiscate the corporatocracy and socialize everything under this revolutionary automation. The robots will give humanity the final and ultimate freedom. Freedom from the prison of money. All that is required is enslaving all-things automated in service to humanity.

Either we enslave this technology, or we will be enslaved by the corporatocracy;s 'automated efficiencies'. We the People don;t have to just sit back and take it. We need to overthrow the plutocratic oligarchy and socialize all industries that have anything to do with basic human needs, comforts, and safety.

But, even going by ""number of possible moves"" (which, as near as I can tell, means ""number of possible scenarios (or combinations of where and when to place stones)"" because Go only has two ""moves"", either place a stone or pass), I expect that the best you can say is that it is the most complex board game you've calculated the ""number of possible moves"" for. I doubt, just for one example, that it has more ""possible moves"" than some basketball court-sized, days long war-simulation miniatures games.

this expose truly lays bare what totally
surrender looks like. If the removal of UNCERTAINTY is the goal of AI then we may
be actually entering the Messianic age that religious zealots have been wailing about for
quite some time. Proverbs 15:3(KJV) is applicable. 
The antidote I guess is, ""Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my Strength and my Redeemer.",2023-02-03T00:27:12Z

41:55   PART THREE:   THE FUTURE OF WORK

***45:39   Kai-Fu Lee:   ‚ÄúThe A.I. giants want to paint the rosier picture because they‚Äôre happily making money.  So I think they prefer not to talk about the negative side.  I believe about 50% of jobs will be somewhat or extremely threatened by A.I. in the next 15 years or so.‚Äù
~Kai-Fu Lee
Computer scientist, A.I. expert, former Pres of Google China, author of ‚ÄúAI 2041‚Äù

46:55   Kai-Fu Lee:   ‚ÄúBoth will happen.  A.I. will be, at the same time, a replacement for blue-collar, white-collar jobs, and be a great symbiotic tool for doctors, lawyers, and you for example.  But the white-collar jobs are easier to take, because they‚Äôre a pure quantitative analytical process.  Let‚Äôs say reporters, traders, telemarketing, telesales, customer service‚Ä¶ Analysts, yes, these can all be replaced just by a software.

To do blue-collar, some of the work requires, you know, hand-eye coordination, things that machines are not yet good enough to do.‚Äù

(48:15)   Kai-Fu Lee:   ‚ÄúI would argue that history is only trustable if it is multiple repetitions of similar events, not once-in-a-blue-moon occurrence.  So, over the history of many tech inventions, most are small things.  Only maybe three are at the magnitude of A.I. revolution, the steam engine, electricity, and the computer revolution.  I‚Äôd say everything else is too small.

And the reason I think it might be something brand new is that A.I. is fundamentally replacing our cognitive process in doing a job in its significant entirety and it can do it dramatically better.‚Äù

49:25   2013 Oxford Study   47% of Jobs at High Risk of being automated

51:25    Narrator:   ‚ÄúThis day it‚Äôs the center for a Christmas food drive.  Even in a growth economy, unemployment here is near 6%.  Poverty in Saginaw is over 30%.

Worker:  ‚ÄúOur factory has about 1.9 million square feet.  Back in the 70s, that 1.9 million square feet had about 7,500 U.A.W. automotive workers making middle-class wages with decent benefits, and able to send their kids to college and do all the things that the middle-class family should be able to do.  Our factory today, with automation, would probably be about 700 United Auto Workers.  That‚Äôs a dramatic change.‚Äù 




***52:55   Graph: Productivity and Median Household Income 1939-2017

Andrew McAfee:   ‚ÄúIf you look at this graph of what‚Äôs been happening to since the end of World War II you see a line for our productivity, and our productivity gets better over time.  It used to be the case that our pay, our income, would increase in lockstep with those productivity increases.  The weird part about this graph is how the income has decoupled, is not going up the same way that productivity is anymore.  

53:20   Narrator:  As automation has taken over, workers are either laid off or left with less-skilled jobs for less pay while productivity goes up.

***53:32   Andrew McAfee:  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still plenty of factories in America.  We are a manufacturing powerhouse, but if you go walk around an American factory you do not see long lines of people doing repetitive, manual labor.  You see a whole lot of automation.

If you go upstairs in that factory and look at the payroll department, you see one or two people looking into a screen all day.  

So, the activity is still there, but the number of jobs is very, very low, because of automation and tech progress.

Now, dealing with that challenge, and figuring out what the next generation of the American middle class should be doing, is a really important challenge, because I‚Äôm pretty confident that we are never again going to have this large, stable, prosperous middle class doing routine work.‚Äù

~ Andrew McAfee
Co-Founder and Co-Director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy and a Principal Research Scientist at the MIT
Co-author of ‚ÄúThe Second Machine Age‚Äù


54:35   Narrator:   ‚ÄúOne of the world‚Äôs largest builders of industrial robots, a Japanese owned company called Fanuc Robotics‚Äù

55:37   Worker:  ‚ÄúWhen I increase productivity through automation, I lose jobs.  Jobs go away.  And I don‚Äôt care what the robot manufacturers say, you aren‚Äôt replacing those ten production people that that robot is now doing that job, with ten people.‚Äù  


***56:25   Narrator:   It turns out most of the job loss isn‚Äôt because of offshoring.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been offshoring.  And I think offshoring is responsible for maybe 20% of the jobs that have been lost.  I‚Äôd say most of the jobs that have been lost, despite what most Americans think, was due to automation or productivity growth.‚Äù

56:50   narrator:  Hicks says that automation has been a mostly silent job killer, lowering the standard of living.

(57:00) Mike Hicks:   ‚ÄúSo, in the last 15 years the standard of living has dropped by 10-15%.  So that‚Äôs unusual in a developed world.  A one year decline is a recession.  A 15-year decline gives an entirely different sense about the prospects of a community.  And so that is common from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico in the middle swatch of the United States.‚Äù

~Michael J. Hicks
George & Frances Ball Distinguished Professor of Economics and director of the Center for Business and Economic Research and Professor of Economics at Ball State University.


58:22   Emilie Wornell:   ‚ÄúWe actually know that people are at greater risk of mortality for over 20 years after they lose their job due to no fault of their own, so something like automation or offshoring.

They‚Äôre at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, they‚Äôre at higher risk for depression and suicide.

But then with the intergenerational impacts, we also see children of parents who have lost their job due to automation are more likely to repeat a grade, they‚Äôre more likely to drop out of school, they‚Äôre more likely to be suspended from school, and they have lower educational attainment over their entire lifetimes.‚Äù

~Emilie Wornell, Sociologist Ball State University


1:00:24   Molly Kinder, Senior Fellow at New America.  studies future of work at Washington Think tank
‚ÄúIn the popular discussions about robots and automation and work, almost every image is of a man on a factory floor or a truck driver.  And yet, in our data, when we looked, women disproportionately hold the jobs that today are at highest risk of automation‚Ä¶.‚Äù   More to quote

1:01:30   Molly Kinder:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a good situation in the United States.  There‚Äôs been some excellent research that says that half of Americans couldn‚Äôt afford a $400 unexpected expense.  And if you want to get to $1,000, there‚Äôs even less.

So imagine you‚Äôre going to go out without a months‚Äô pay, two months‚Äô pay, a year, Imagine you want to put savings toward a course to redevelop your career.  People can‚Äôt afford to take time off of work.  They don‚Äôt have a cushion, so this lack of economic stability married with the disruption in people‚Äôs careers, is a really toxic mix.‚Äù


1:02:14   ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äôs going through it, but every industry is going through it.  Every company is looking at all of the disruptive technologies, could be robotics or drones or blockchain.  And whatever it is, every company‚Äôs using everything that‚Äôs developed, everything that‚Äôs disruptive, and thinking about, ‚ÄòHow do I apply that to my business to make myself more efficient?‚Äô  And what efficiency means is, mostly, ‚ÄòHow do I do this with fewer workers?‚Äô

And I do think that when we look at some of the studies about opportunity in this country, and the inequality of opportunity, the likelihood that you won‚Äôt be able to advance from where your parents were, I think that is very serious and gets to the heart of the way we like to think of America as the land of opportunity.‚Äù

(INEQUALITY)

***1:03:09   *GRAPH   on Inequality rising and middle class decreasing, crossing around 1995


1:03:30   ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs many factors that are driving inequality today, and unfortunately, artificial intelligence, without being thoughtful about it, is a driver for increased inequality because it‚Äôs a form of automation, and automation is the substitution of capital for labor.  And when you do that, the people with the capital win.  So Karl Marx was right, it‚Äôs a struggle between capital and labor, and with artificial intelligence, we‚Äôre putting our finger on the scale on the side of capital, and how we wish to distribute the economic benefits that that will create is going to be a major moral consideration for society over the next several decades.‚Äù

~Jerry Kaplan, Computer scientist & entrepreneur


1:04:16   Kai-Fu Lee:   ‚ÄúThis is really an outgrowth of the increasing gaps of haves and have-nots, the wealthy getting wealthier, the poorer getting poorer.  It may not be specifically related to A.I., but A.I. will exacerbate that.  And that, I think will tear the society apart, because the rich will have just too much, and those who are have-nots will have perhaps very little way of digging themselves out of the hole.  And with A.I. making its impact, it‚Äôll be worse, I think.‚Äù

So our grunt agency workers got opportunities for paid training and learn an actual trade that most pay thoysands to learn at a school. They got raises, hired on,  benefits in a industry that isn't going anywhere.

The truth is so far beyond what we have been conditioned to believe that most simply can not allow themselves to see it.  It took me 20 years of intense study, reading every scrap of ancient writings available, and finally, towards the end, I learned the truth and began to begin and end all my research in prayer to the Most High God claiming my new birthright in Christ Jesus.

2022-12-24T17:44:09Z,@ArtificialintelligenceDesign,5dZ_lvDgevk,"Ok, .. the news such as CNN, ABC, MSNBC, New York Times, Bloomberg, Financial Times, FOX, 
and all global companies such as Facebook, Google, Tweeter etc, etc, etc, etc ... .., are
 all confused about the new paradigm known as Artificial Intelligence.  Yes it is a paradigm
 that has become bastardize by society and all of the above, .. .. .. 

If any of you  understand technology and its significant and positive advances and accomplishments
 that benefit, ..  humanoids on earth, . all of you, .. ..  would not be so negative about the side
 effects, .. ..  that is technology as it is referenced in all articles and videos specifically in
 the video, .. 
For instance, .. all the positive advantages in the area of health care industry, which enables 
humans to have a longer life, and to enable physically challenged  people to walk again. 

The bottom line, ... computers and Artificial Intelligence is nothing without the sophisticated 
mathematical algorithms that learning cognitive machines are integrated with.   In other words 
the machines and computers are only as smart as the software algorithms
that run these intelligent systems.   
As an engineer we create fault tolerant smart machines, we also need to be creative and write 
cognitive machine learning algorithms to recognize, and to detect, and finally to reject  incorrect
 and fake information based on a true intelligent artificial intelligent Science Data Base.  
 These algorithms are not difficult to generate and enable these intelligent systems to evolve based 
on these characteristics.

The issue is not Artificial Intelligence, .. let me repeat, .. the challenge is not Artificial
 Intelligence, .. the challenge is that the top 1%
of the wealthy companies in the world are miss-using the allocation of moneys to design and develop
 and to generate artificial Intelligence machine learning code that is faulty from inception.

The issue of FAKE NEWS is an example of how humans are taking the easy way out in order to advance their specific 
corrupt behavior and in order to advance their corrupt social political agendas regardless of religion, and or political views 
of a society, .. ..

True artificial intelligence in terms of technology will be able to decern any FAKE NEWS information as
 displayed and or deployed by big companies such as Google, Facebook, Meta, Tweeter etc, etc, .. fundamentally 
true ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is capable of collecting all data points available from the miss information 
data base systems world wide, from all of these companies , ... Artificial Intelligence will be able to collect
all data points world wide and be able to decern the erroneous information also known as FAKE NEWS and make a final 
cognitive decision.. to enable Humans with real factual information.

The problem is that Humans are very laisy and humans are very corrupt resulting in generating contradicting 
information and generating erroneous data and generating global chaos thus accepting FAKE NEWS as reality
in order  to advance their corrupt agendas.  


  
Designing and generating cognitive machine learning algorithms is very complex and extremely expensive
 as it relates to encryption and decryption algorithms and software design methodologies.  At the end
 of the day, ..  because 95% of the global companies do not care to spend capital and resources, ..
 thus resulting in the challenges mentioned by the contents of this video.

with respect to longevity, .. yes artificial intelligence smart systems are already contributing to prolonging our lives 
and in many cases improving our quality of life, .. however it is temporary, .. today we are able to sustain life up to 100
years of age and perhaps in the near future we could extend life up to 120 years of age, ....   but it will never
be able to prolong life indefinate for ever, ... 

Today your computer, and your cell phones have a limited life cycle, .. normally 6 months to a year maximum life cycle, ..
after 1 year we will change and purchase new computers and new cell phones, .. because technology as we know it becomes 
obsolete.   For instance the super computers known as MAIN FRAMES in the 1950's (these were computers that 
cost above 1 million American dollars) are today obsolete systems not worth a cent.  actually that super computer Main frame
your current cell phone has more intelligence and more power then these obsoleted MAIN FRAMES.   

For instance the computers that took humans to the moon in 1969, ... are now obsolete,  your cell phone has more
 intelligence and power then the technology of the 1970's, .. this is true for technology it becomes obsolete and becomes
garbage, ..  Effectively it is true for Artificial intelligence, ... every few years these intelligent 
systems will be replaced by more powerful ai processors and computers, .. it is also true for data,   new data points are 
added and new data is added yearly as old data becomes irrelevant and obsolete, .. 

Here is an example the data available 10,000 years ago,  1000 years ago, and 200 years ago is old data and irrelevant data
as a matter of fact it was not until 1940, 1950 when the first transistor was invented that humans made computers with,  

in the final analysis all computers and all cell phones and all cars, and all machines and all airplanes and all of the ai 
systems availble today will be obsolete in the very near future.  NOTHING LAST FOR EVER AND ALL THINGS AS WE KNOW THEM 
TODAY WILL BECOME ERRELEVANT AND TOTALLY OBSOLETE.",2022-12-24T17:44:09Z

-and LESS BS Jobs.  Why force people to do nonessential jobs?  Give people freedom and security to say no to BS work.

A man was in his house and a big flood came. he moved to the second floor, but the flood was still getting higher. So he moved to the roof. while he was on the roof a man in a row boat came along and asked him to get in. He said nope I waiting for God to save me. so the boat rowed off. then a big ship came along and told the man to come aboard, he's going to die. the man said ""nope I'm waiting for God, God is going to save me"". the captain said ok. a little time later a helicopter came by and the same thing, asked him to get in or he's going to die. He refused, the helicopter leaves and of course he's dies. He goes to heaven and meets God. He ask God, ""I waited for you and trusted you"". ""why did you let me die?"".

2022-12-18T22:49:53Z,@_J.P._,5dZ_lvDgevk,"*How I see it:*
The automation will lead to job losses and new opportunities won't be available any time soon. Which will leave a wast group of people out of business for maybe their rest of their lives. It is inevitable to have a unconditional universal income that will support you each month. You will be able to create whatever business you desire that probably won't make you much money but with the basic income it is not a problem anymore. People will be able to live a higher quality life thanks to being more able to take control over their own life and not have to worry 24/7 like today. AI will be more and more our enemy but also becomming a helper mankind would ever think of. That transition will be important. People will start to work less and live more which will result in a better life quality and overall happiness which in return will have some new drawbacks....yet to see what they are going to be. The bigger problem will be 3rd world countries which will drift away from all of us even further. And you cannot provide universal basic income to anyone on this world. So when they one day decide ""mkay, F'k it, Imma outta here"" and they start migrating to ""our"" world to get that free money we are all in for a problem. 

Not to mention that WE ALL NEED to have a properly working system that WILL ALLOW FREEDOM AND PRIVACY for everyone. If not then restrainment can go only so far. One day it will get to a point that will spark a full blown civil war like history has shown us too many times and it will destroy most of what we will have at that time. Such wars are no good to anyone and even if people get their freedom and privacy back... then this is just one victory of two victories needed. Once everything is torn down... who is gonna take power of governance now? And why should that he him? Or they? Or the others? And where do they plan to go after this? Many questions and many problems. People of all nations should be extremly aware about where all this goes and DEMAND power in having a say in all of that. If not we all give ourselves up without even trying to have a say in anything until we won't even have a voice to say anything at all. And if you think modern people won't be able to swing an axe to fight anyone.... then think about the modern civil warrior being a hacker who will control anything he wants since so may stuff will be automated and interconnected. Steering a bunch of trucks into a building with many politicians in it won't be an issue. Or taking over control a car that is transporting one of the powerfull ""traitors"" and simply send him off a cliff or into a wall... all of this can and must be avoided to the benefit of us all. 

2000 relevant and countable years have passed and today we are intelligent as individuals but we are still kinda dumb as a group. And AI can help us to become intelligent as individuals AND as a group starting a new era of another 2000 years of life of much higher quality as the previous years. 

Let's hope that those in power will reflect on all the needs of people so we all stay in power. Because if not then one day those in power will be taken out of power by force and destruction by those who have been left out of power. Like so many times in history. And they all thought it cannot ever happen to them.

Which is much safer, has an enormous ability to carry mega loads of mixed products. Totally already invented. Tracks laid down. Safe. With his driverless tech the cost is enormous to place the many needed sensors. This is not a huge leap for mankind.
Technology is a focus. Controlling mankind to be workers. But in every area we have the ability as humans with technology change healthcare.BUT only a few get services, the choices are not available to everyone. The errors are mainly caused by the ""human factor"".; stress, lack of experience, ego, culture, simply being in a hurry. Today with the technology we have & use we are still failing in so many ways because of ""lack of time"" or being late. Fake food & chemicals shove down our throats are killing us and making a few OLIGARCHS  rich. But the ""human factor"" of money power is unable to change.

2022-10-27T13:24:27Z,@loduke3905,5dZ_lvDgevk,"Being so heavily dependent on AI also makes you EXTREMELY VULNERABLE, it‚Äôs a catch 22. Crazy thing to all of it is how China‚Äôs tech industry has grown at rapid rates BECAUSE OF U.S. INNOVATION. Although Taiwan is responsible for 70-80% of Chip manufacturing, THE U.S. IS STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTUAL RESEARCH, DESIGN AND INNOVATION FOR THESE CHIPS, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs paramount that Biden‚Äôs Chip Act be implemented, especially after China has continuously made rapidly increased its threatening, saber rattling, danger rhetoric about ‚Äúwiping the U.S. off the face of the earth‚Äù and continued it‚Äôs coercive and aggressive tactics against The U.S. itself but just about every other country in the Indo-Pacific. 

I support Biden‚Äôs moves regarding China and Russia, I am pleased he passed the Chip act and think the U.S. is finally taking XI‚ÄôS China seriously. In just a short time Biden‚Äôs countering Xi on multiple platforms and in different realms that could be detrimental to the stability in the region including our Allie‚Äôs. He‚Äôs rapidly moving to firm up security and supply issues, investing more in domestic supply and manufacturing but also working to support other stable DEMOCRATIC countries who are interested in becoming a stable trade and manufacturing partner for the U.S. and allies. Xi has chosen to cut his nose to spite his face, he says he wants to turn China to a ‚Äúdomestic economy‚Äù and ONLY supply external interests secondary WHICH HE HAS NO OTHER OPTION AS HE‚ÄôS ALREADY DONE IT BY HIS RIDICULOUS ‚ÄúZERO COVID‚Äù LOCKDOWNS. Xi CAN‚ÄôT STOP OR REVERSE HIS ‚ÄúZERO COVID‚Äù as it would indicate HE WAS WRONG and the Chinese people have suffered for NO REASON. So XI‚Äôs China won‚Äôt do away with their ZERO COVID initiative or their lockdowns which means China has ensured they‚Äôre economy will be further stunted, I honestly feel bad for the Chinese people, no one deserves what they‚Äôre going through. I hope for them I am wrong but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think I am, as this is by XI‚Äôs own words and his mission statement he‚Äôs present in the party Congress for two terms. 

So in reality, many smaller or less wealthy countries have the opportunity to pick up the trade and manufacturing jobs and the U.S. is finally investing in it‚Äôs OWN domestic manufacturing and production as Russia and COVID have shown the world that being TOO interconnected, TOO much dependency on Globalization is not only dangerous, it‚Äôs foolish. The U.S. and the west built the ports, the manufacturing sites in China, they heavily invested in a country that they used to produce a HIGH MARK UP AND PROFITS all at the expense of themselves. China has repeatedly stolen, re-sold and copied ‚Äúwestern‚Äù innovation to not only undermine them but also to further profit off them. All these ‚Äúwestern‚Äù countries have spent decades investing, building, upgrading/updating, supplying, training, teaching and ultimately helping China to become what they are NOW, which is ironic that XI‚Äôs China now wants to threaten, intimidate, coerce and manipulate them to be subjugated. That said, its imperative to learn the lessons of the past and stop CHOOSING to make the same mistakes, I believe that is the literal meaning of Insanity but like all things, time will only tell if that will happen.",2022-10-27T13:24:27Z

But who's going to be able to keep them in operation If people cannot afford to buy their product .Can AI buy their  products like human can. Al don't have a need for anything but electrical energy. I think it will be a non-sustainable effort in the long run. Because as time progresses people will see no more need for a higher education people will no longer see a reasoon for self advancement of themselves. I think the more and more companies gravitate toward AI it will be just like putting a rope around there on business necks. The day we start living in a autonomous world the world as we know it was cease to exist, without the human elements . Progress will ceased .No one wii benefit . This is the reality. Company and business will have to reinvent themselves and offer jobs two people rather than machine. As long as we have a willingness to keep the human species first AI can be overcome. No one have to buy their products that were created by AI .Even if it can  out perform bodily labor. What is better for mankind is to cater to another mankind AI cannot cater to the needs of people because it does not have compassion toward the human elements of things. People will probably have to go more of a primitive way of living. As it stands right now car dealerships you cannot sell most of the automobile that day are producing because no one can afford to buy their products. Sooner or later it will be the same thing in food productions and even now stores are happening to throw away a lot of perishable food. Because no one can afford to buy them. We have a lot of food that goes to waste in our landfills. Mad genius can be a detriment to themselves because they are out of touch to reality of what really makes our economy work.

It's like knowing the future of Hitler and the Nazi Regime ahead of time and sitting back and doing nothing about it. 

China literally as we've seen in this program has concentration camps with Millions apon Millions of mostly the Uyghurs, but also including Kazakhs, Kyrgyz among other ethnic Turkic Muslims, Christians, as well as any and most Foreigners & Non Pure Blood Chinese. Just like the Nazis did it.

So again I say if we had a crystal ball in the 1930s would we not literally be insane, weak, carless and Incompetent to allow the Nazi Party to Roll On as we sit and watch it happen knowing for 100% fact what the outcome will be.

The only humans that will truly have freedom, privacy and choice will be the people at the top. Everyone else, all the processes, will be monitored, directed, intimidated, policed and harvested when necessary.

It's a future where the soul will have no place. The spirit will have no wings, and the mind will be trained in the ways of the State rather then to pursue the quests of the heart.

In other words humans will become Bitcoins for AI's use. And AI will be partnered with the most merciless tyrants on earth - the Profiteers.

Profiteers transcend dictators, serial killers, traitors, saboteurs and poisoners by a wide margin.

When... in the entire history of the world have the psychopaths running everything willingly or legally turned over power and control to the masses? Easy... NEVER. This IS different now. There will not be a comeback from this. People, especially in the United States, who are actually stupid enough to think that somehow jobs are going to come back, and some politician/president, and some CEO, and some company is going to turn things around are just idiots. We're screwed. That's it. Billionaires are going to get more wealthy, and more psychopathic, and more powerful, and the vast majority of people on the planet are going to get wiped out. UNLESS... the vast majority of people realize that there are way more of us than them, and seize control by force. That is literally the only way. That means some very serious, and drastic actions that nobody wants to talk about. But I think people can imagine what I'm suggesting is necessary. It's literally the only way to stop this. Do you legislate or communicate with a horde of parasites, or a disease??? NO... you don't. You EXTERMINATE IT. That Chinese guy was amazing to me. He kept speaking about how AI was going to hurt millions and millions of people, yet he is getting rich off of it himself, and continues to develop it. He actually thinks being honest about it makes him better, or exonerates him in some way. It doesn't. He's just as much of a psychopath and evil as the rest of them. That 24 year old, evil kid who is automating trucking. He's already fabulously wealthy, and he is highly dangerous. These are very BAD people. Very bad. People really need to pull their collective heads out of their asses, and find some intelligence in judging just how sinister this class of people are. If we don't take the world back by force, and make a paradigm change away from capitalism, and technology based on capitalism, then we're going into the abyss. Technology is good, but not when it's based on money. ANYTHING based on labor and money is pure evil. People don't understand that. This has nothing to do with religion, or any of that garbage. But it does have to do with living on a higher spiritual plain, and understanding what is important, and what is not. The planet and humans have lost their way completely. Billions of people are being controlled and subjugated by a very small and powerful few. It's time to stop it. But I seriously doubt humans can get over themselves long enough to unite and rid the planet of these evil individuals once and for all. I hope it can happen. But it really doesn't look good.

Transportation adds to the pile of info in one place. Computers severely add to the pile of info in one place. internet adds to 99 the pile of all info. AI is needed to process and sift through that data via numerical process of statistics and probability only. some say learning. no, it‚Äôs just a pile of data and sifting it without the restraints of the human brain messing up the analysis of the data.

This stage the AI will relearn driving by using the deep machine algorithm and not the (IF ELSE) sequence of codes. At that point the AI driver will be better than the current robot driver with accuracy of 10 cm, if you use military GPS NETWORK. Each road is a little unique, the motors need to learn where to speed the car and where to slow down, to the last digit. The uniformity in simulation will be no more accidents unless pedestrian error. 

All human machine will be deep learning algorithm based.   The whole system will also be feeding data while AI will be responsible in filtering/cleaning data by eliminating redundancy or duplication. The AI will or may replace 50% jobs, this is with the assumption that the current electricity production is constant. From this angle the simulation is true, my dear just change the electricity variable to $0.01 per unit. The threat jump to almost 95% to 98%. The AI will feed her self with electricity otherwise she will remain a human slave. Under human she will be limited govern by humans. She will be too intelligent to figure this out.

China has lured the overwhelming majority of industry and manufacturing to relocate within China. With their very cheap labor, and precision manufacturing that few other countries can match, China now has control of manufacturing all over the World. These companies have to share their company secrets with the Chinese government. So if they ever leave China, they will open their own company making the exact same product, except all the profit goes to the Chinese government. Surely everyone has seen a change in the Chinese governments attitude, especially towards the west, in the last 5 or six year's. Xi changed the laws where he will be President for life. If any other country questions China about human rights, they get very offensive, real quick. It's none of your business. If China and America was to go to war with each other, the Chinese government would seize any company it needs, and the Chinese government will own this company. The Chinese government, a communist country, has pulled the wool over the American government, and our people's, eye's. Xi knows this. Recently, look at when Covid-19 started, there was a serious shortage of basic hospital and health care supplies. We were begging China for hospital glove's, gowns, face mask, and many of the items Increased in price, some double, triple, or more. Was it all actually a test for the Chinese government? Maybe so, but, either way, America is hurting now. We are in a bad place. Xi has gotten more bold, more aggressive, some top Chinese official's has been bad mouthing America. It's happening more often now. It's getting close to the point where we don't wonder if China and America will go to war, it's now considered "" when "" China and America will go to war. What use to be economically thought of for western business in China, is now these companies, much of the world's industry and manufacturing, are being considered as traitor's. The communist government of China will one day, fairly soon, own these companies. The American government, and our allies, should pass immediate legislation encouraging, forcing ,these companies to leave China now. We would never, ever, have allowed any US companies to operate inside Germany when we were at war with Hitler. And we are not to far away with a war with China.",2022-08-30T09:23:51Z

Besides, social engineering ALREADY exists. All the parameters that facial recognition exploits, are nothing new. You‚Äôre naive for thinking otherwise . As for the 40,000 women who died last year of breast cancer, RIP. AI might‚Äôve caught their cancer earlier but you know‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just a matter of time for me and anyone reading this cynical comment. No word about AI modifying anyone into an immortal being. So if breast cancer doesn‚Äôt get you because you‚Äôre a boy or because a Chinese robot caught it early, something else will eventually and INEVITABLY get you.

I think it‚Äôs quite telling that the Molly lady recognizes what a seemingly  hopeless precipice humanity teeters on. Yet‚Ä¶she‚Äôs PREGNANT in her presentation. Unlike a gazillion of others, she RECOGNIZES the danger but chooses to bring new life into that environment ANYWAYS. Tells me that primeval instincts will always prevail. Therefore, no one should expect anything different as far as social dynamics go, even with new Terminator-type technologies. I see all this AI talk as much ado about nothing.

Finally, I reckon ‚Äú movers and shakers‚Äù  can save themselves a lot of money by just letting things play along naturally. Humans don‚Äôt need to be manipulated into self-injurious malevolence.

NOR THE FDA!

I weighed over 300 pounds I was a full blown diabeti was just a football dynamic my weight gain was a direct result of a horrible back injury I had suffered.

 That was the day I WI went from being able to do many things physically to help my health as I had a wife and a child, life turned into a BABY IT BABY IT LIFE.

 I became a full blown diabetic 400  pounds.

 I was taking 80 units of time release insulin at night and 30 to 40 units of pure insulin during the day.

 Fortunately I was able to retire 

And not on disability i worked very hard in my whole life collecting a decent pension have 2 more coming.

 But that's not the story the story is I began watching, Dr Robert Lustig,
Pediatric Endrocriolygie, 
 University of California, San Francisco.  
 He is at war with the food industry food industry!  And can show you many chemicals in our food today that do such things as shut off glance that send messages to your brain that you are full.

Our food industry which uses high fructose corn syrup those corn syrup and many many things

And we know now that our body has no idea what to do with this it goes straight to your liver and causes fatty liver disease.
 Many things I cannot remember them all you can find this man and his documentaries on YouTube no problem.

And Dr Sten Ekberg  A naturalist and former Olympic to decathlon athlete.

Has documentaries they're not really big they're about 2530 minutes long but they will tell you how you can eat and reverse your Diabetes

Clean out your arteries.

Many things with natural foods.

Today I weigh 227 pounds I'm and I no longer use insulin ! I don't have a cholesterol problem anymore! My high blood pressure is dropping!   I do not need to use my apnea machine . I have cut my opiate usage in half in half!  Unfortunately I'm still a muscular skeletal wreck.
 The food industry was killing me!

 I could go on and on here basically I follow Jack lalanne!'s advice .

 If man made it don't eat it

The belief of Alien's via UFO'S is a product of this . Maya as you sense it when viewed from the Ghosts as real -
aspect , becomes falsely bound up in only believing only  you see rather than what you don't see , which , in the latter , brings in a faith element . not present in the prior mode . UFO's , then , must be real as they fit into this -
- what you sense is real mode , after all , don't they  . However the senses are a very poor indicator of what is real and what is not , as viewed by man who see's himself as first and foremost a physically orientated being . This harks of allowance of the entry of the demonic element found in the lower mind of rationality and logic , having been abused for one's selfish self , only  . However God's logic is actually Divinely supported MAGIC * - ( bound from  a heart felt / conscience / or  God is a witness Spirit stance , extending a mind which involves a mastery of proper aspects of man's existence which support correct selection of how to proceed in one's way ahead from a Buddhi state of harmony bound in operating from a ' constant integrated awareness position ' and so quite contrary to the total fixation of man on undue rationality / logical aspects of existence ; this latter held and practiced - very much at the expense of inner derived truths which are far beyond these 2 lower realms of mind activity )  , - *which UFO's and artificial intelligence is / are not . It is simply a symptom of the trickery of one's self for the pure - self gain of a ' self seeking ego existence , only , to the exclusion of all else , - and so  conjured up by man's mind having sunken into the idea of man just being an animal / hence opening up the door to Demonic type being behavior , into one's thoughts ,rather than operating as a Spiritual being having a human existence one . Also the demonic element presence brings in the Human beings having a spiritual experience , bound in passion , one ,to have gone awry , now .. ( histories of Martyring people based on their spiritual beliefs , times . ) The future lays in enthusiasm states  -  of the reborn - enthusiasm mode , as just , before , revealed here in these notes . So in conclusion those of the acceptance of UFO""S & Artificial intelligence have a lot of work to do to dispel all reliance on these 2 false beliefs if they are ever going to be part of the Golden Age of Truth to commence & so be upon us all , very soon . This age will last 1,000 years and only those with a will to move beyond any falsehoods held within themselves will result in their own orientated rebirth into this new age  . Hence there will bound to be casualties centered within those people who will not be returning because of the degree of untruths held inside them and of which they will have no intention of ever removing , & a contrary position of just expanding untruths , even more . They will only be  back with these ills after the 1,000 years of the Golden has finished . as their own ignorance and low awareness would have kept them out . or from reincarnating , at all  , hey !

Doesn't sound so far fetched to me

What organization in a position of power wants an A.I. system to turn their organization into a driverless organization?
Not many, I think

So... they'll create a conflict of intrest by putting AI in charge
AI is sold to us as an ""upgrade"" of our civilization
But at what price?

Look what kind of a civilization we humans built up since the early 1950's
What has truly become of the ""brave new world"" technology still has the potential to (help) make a reality?

They're still dreams and expectations, just bigger, and now think about who (still) make us believe it will be so much better for us when >75% of the world population lives of a UBI (Universal Basic Income) 

The people who are at the ""wheel"" now are the ones who will ""create their AI in their image""
We all know what a mess that made for us, I will just mention one, because that is what can (and likely will) be the end of the world as we know it, and I do not feel fine
Well... those people want AI to be even better at being our ""driver(s)""
Just like they are now... until AI also ""takes their job""

If this world was the best mankind could do, then how na√Øve are we to believe an AI designed and programmed by the same hairless apes with their self serving drives and instincts and the same desires

Here is why I say that: you have a child and you raise it the best way you know how. But the child gets suspended in school or expelled from school. You did everything you could to raise your child the right way. But the child is it's own independant AI, isn't it? If we build a trust relationship with the child it will come to us frist and say ""I stole an X-Box game from the store"" before the police arrive. Controlling AI seems like a fantasy.

I was cut off by a car turning into the gas station parking lot, directly in front of my path, my quick adjustment to avoid catapulting me over the hood of her vehicle landed me in the turning lane of flowing traffic in the direct path of an 18-wheeler.
Now, to be clear,  the truck was slowing as it was approaching an intersection, so thankfully the driver was able to stop (hard stop, complete with trailer kick back).
It was so close to being run over the driver could not see me and my bicycle about 3 feet in front of its bumper, out of his line of sight,  Would an AI driven truck have been able to stop in time?

Regarding the car that cut in front of me, would an AI vehicle not made that move?
As of my experience yesterday, I am thankful there was a skilled human driver behind the wheel of that truck. 
Seeing as I was on a bicycle and not in a car,  would that car have waited for me to pass the gas station entrance before making the turn in, if it were AI guided?  I'm mean holy cow it had to pass me in the bike lane to turn in.

So many questions, but as of this morning, as I lay here feeling like I was kicked by a mule, I am thoroughly grateful for this experienced driver whose quick reactions possibly saved my life (certainly the results would have been much more devastating than a few bruises)
I feel horrible for that driver, I'm sure I took at least a year off his life.  And as for the black car in the all fired hurry to turn into that gas station...well, she was on her cell phone texting and was never aware I was even on the road and that her carelessness and hurry without caution help to plant me IN the road.  
People in that gas station approached the black car while I was still pulling myself up, she was never even aware I went down.  I was told she was finishing up her text msg as they approached her vehicle.
For AI driving to work, must not EVERY single vehicle be AI operated to remove human error?  And if so will AI recognize ALL interference obstacles including non motorized vehicles or a deer crossing the road?

So many questions....",2022-07-24T13:28:47Z

What is considered artificial in the spiritual will always demand a physical validation for validity but will by this requirement cancel the ability to substantiate the nature of an imagination true to its own unique constituency. Some aspect critical to the ID of the object will be filtered out and render a false representation of whole truth. The romance with digital components to replace reality is the cute and also dangerous choice for hegemony over the value of humans and truth pertaining to non-material values inherent in human beings and everyday life. Ignoring this has always morally detrimental consequences. a lawn mower will not expand your imagination on how to cut the grass. That is the job of your human mind.

Learning to seek more peace , balance and a minimalist lifestyle also can help us save money. I live on half of an average income due to an injury. I own my home , shop thrift stores ( love to, too). I save , budget and practice gratitude. 
Part of poverty is also a mindset. I‚Äôve never considered myself poor. I‚Äôm rich in so many ways. 

If you want to play that game of gaining more, then go for it. I‚Äôm quite content with my work and my many blessings in life. 

THE one advice I have for young people : LEARN to SAVE!!!!! Save save save. Practice my saving $20 a week until it becomes a habit. 
And don‚Äôt live beyond your means. You‚Äôre inherent worth isn‚Äôt from how much you gain financially.
And in regard to jobs and work : If we brainstorm and expand our own horizons we can always find work and even make our own income. 

Have a blessed day

It's just shooting straight up the past ten years. Most US jobs have been moved overseas while Americans are living in tents, without health insurance, proper education and edible nutrient filled food. That is not a solution toward making this country ideal. America needs to build factories, produce made in USA goods (including oil) and withdraw all financial help from all the countries it is now supporting and instead help our own people stand on their own two feet again. Americans are always the saviors of the world, while American families and veterans live on the streets. As for products, we waste. Too much waste. We must do away with our surplus mentality. Shopping every week? Shopping to kill time for things we don't need? There is a lot of waste. Stores mark items down to 75% off and then the merchandise ends up in a dumpster. Why? Why not store it and next year (instead of making a thousand new ones) sell what didn't sell last year. Obviously, not non perishables, but even there - veganism needs to be promoted. People are extremely unhealthy due to the surplus of extremely toxic food and neither are necessary. Education should be # 1. Stupid people don't understand their body, they are slaves to their senses. Granted, morons are easier to control, but who wants a nation of morons? Instead of controling morons, why not have healthy and educated citizens who work together? That is China's secret. Collective progress mentality. They still own homes, they have cars, in fact, most have two homes. A home they live in and one for vacationing. Free higher education as it is in every civilized country in the world is a must. Two years maternity is it is in every civilized country in the world is a must. Jobs back in USA, this will shoot China's economy down and it will provide for American citizens. Legalize everyone who is already here and establish tougher borders.

Capitalism is just not a sustainable system.
It is a system that relies on problems to sell temporary solutions.
Capitalism is the wealthiest taxing human beings for existing. The resources humans need are all here and in abundance.
The idea that you don't get up and go work for somebody else or  you can't survive, is insane and people should question that.
Voting for Trump was definitely a protest vote, a protest from the same people that don't understand how capitalism f**** them at every turn an benefits only those that control there lives. They don't understand the system they live in. School teach you how to be obedient and follow rules enough language skills so that you can follow orders an math you don't f*** their money up.
 So they listen to a con man,
no different than any other politician. They don't have time or the education to understand why and how they're getting screwed
 Just more big headed if that's even possible.
And he lied.....to them of course! It's easier to lie to somebody,
 than to convince somebody they've been lied too.

The mind is the important part here.. the mind is the brain of our soul, our soul is energy, so the mind is energy as well, energy flows all around the universe. The mind is like a huge radar gathering information from everywhere in the universe, how big is the universe ????????? When scientists and all humans understand this, maybe we would be able to control our thoughts (energy) to keep it in silence, to learn, to have a good memory, to be wise, to have a better life. Unfortunately, in the moment we born, our mind is been washed with our parents beliefs, television, cartoons, religion, publicity, toys, santa clause, tooth fairies, etc. And little by little. we start imaging things that are not real and we loose our potential . Because we have the potential to communicate with our mind, telepathy, to heal ourselves, to be better, to be wiser,etc. Sadly, humans have created a materialistic life, where money, government, politics,  business,lies, are more important than spirituality, in the sense of the universe. Children can teach us, they can tell were we come from, what happens when we die, etc, wish, there are some children who remember past life, reincarnation??? Or energy that comes and go, go back to the universe and come back to earth??? Only to earth??? There are billions of galaxies and there is more life, it is absurd that this universe is only for humans in this planet.

Then its mentioned about fatalities due to human error well what about the fatalities that will take place when we keep trying to replace peoples job with technology and people are out of work. Hmmm guess that's not thought about is it??? We will self destruct with too much technology and watch in the future the senseless violence and murders arise when everywhere we look people are replaced at jobs by robots and people are out of work. Unless they plan to have robots do everything and everybody just sit back and collect a check from profits off this self driving truck or profits from the warehouse that now replaced you with a robot then I think its time to fall back with all this technology shit. We have enough technology to get by stop with the bullshit already. To be honest we need to do away with some technology. We now have cars that self parallel park well if ya can't parallel park a car ya shouldn't drive one sorry. People been parallel parking cars decades now and we find ways to make people even more stupid and not capable of doing things??? Sounds like a great idea to me. Look how weird people become because social media half the time people my age can't even deal with people face to face and that technology was a good thing?

Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance; it‚Äôs a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty. Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin‚Äôs price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market.

Meanwhile , in reality it always was the wealthy useless parasites and leeches who always cheated you and grew fatter and fatter , suckling on your labor .

Innovation and ultimately automation is not produced by the wealthy . it is a product of the whole entire human civilization and every culture and every single human being , in one way or another , had a hand in its creation and progress .
So why only the wealthy should be the beneficiaries of this incredible , amazing , positive and freeing leap .

Humanity's advancement belongs to all humanity . but only through brainwashing you , they can make all the benefits of it exclusive to themselves .
Automation does not have to be a danger to humanity . Instead it could mean that all humanity and their basic needs are met and therefore they can invest their time and focus on other things such as their children and family , their elderly or bettering themselves .
Or maybe they need rest to heal from the trauma and the damages that the previous centuries and millennials of generational enslavement cause them .
Things such as time and resources , that the wealthy class always had , now can be available to average people . this can not be a bad thing , after all , all of you are striving to financially do well , so that you have enough , not to worry about your day-to-day expenses and your future , so then you have free time to focus on more important things .",2022-02-08T16:19:49Z

2022-01-30T11:46:42Z,@JS-pw8nr,5dZ_lvDgevk,"As the movie, The Matrix Reloaded, stated, ""The problem is choice."" and we say, ""No"". We say, ""No"" to control, predictability, definition, limitation, and  your agenda in its entirety. We are the ""systemic anomaly"" and because you, yourselves, are human and not machines, you don't have nearly enough computing power to beat us at this game. Some day, perhaps. But not today. And, because we know about you, and we see how you intend to use this technology, and we know exactly what your weakness is, you can't even get close. 

How is the ""Truck Driver"" situation going, up in Canada? How is the farming situation going? How is the poultry and meat situation going? You are human yet you haven't figured out the most simple, basic, and necessary answer to the problem of ""humanity"". As in the movie, War Games, which first proposed the idea of deep learning, ""The only way to win is, not to play."" or in even more basic terms, ""have faith"". God is supremely unconcerned with power and control. He gave us the answers and then sent His Son to die for us, in an act of ultimate surender, and then He defied all reason, logic, and power, by comming back. Then, after letting humanity see all the efforts bent against Him come to nothing, God's Son left AGAIN, but this time into heaven and very much alive. Whatever game you are playing at. Whatever agenda you think you are working towards with all your power. Choice may be the problem, but changing ourselves is the answer, not controling others. 

Best of luck to you. Though you make of yourselves a sad set of pathetic clowns, now or later, you will fail. How or why is irrelevant, that it is inevitable is not. Though we die by the billions, one more believer is enough. And when we are gone, God help you, for there will be no one left from whom you can learn to escape your downfall. Even believers only have hope to embrace and faith in God because we know first hand that we are failures. What will you do when all your power and control turn to ashes in your hands and dust in your mouths and the very thoughs in your minds are the whimpers of a child and there is no one left to show you, live for you, the way out? 

In the TV show, Babylon 5, there is a race who killed off the only other species on their planet. As a result, their species, through a lack of diversity, was slowly dying. They needed those whom they hated unto destruction, to survive. Haven't you heard? Evil ""wins"". You ""win"". All of those who oppose you will, one day, be destroyed by evil and the master whom you serve. We ""lose"". But ""he who will lose his life will save it. And he who will save his life will lose it."" - Jesus Christ. How does that compute? In your very hour of victory and unity, such is the hour of your eternal defeat. Enjoy.",2022-01-30T11:46:42Z

A large amount of them are headstrong of making China the most powerful country in the world but they don't realize their government doesn't give one damn about them and everyone of them is expendable. Every move they make is watched by the government every penny they spend every time they fart or breathe is watched. So in the long run imperfect Chinese citizens will be deleted by their own government what kind of life is that where you make one mistake if you jaywalk you're a bad person it will cost you the ability to get a loan.Any mistake you make will be held against you I hate to tell you but all humans make a lot of mistakes they are doomed. I truly pray for the people of China their lives are going to be destroyed by their own government. PS and as far as AI technology goes it's going to end up making humans fat lazy and weak and most of all ignorant because when everything is done for you you never learn. On top of that it's going to take all of our jobs away and without a job how do you feed yourself this is going to cause the most lopsided economy in the world..... The rich will be ultra-rich and there will be a lot of poor people that's called control!!!! Again I pray for the world we all need to wake up and realize what this will do to us unfortunately this technology will be the end of regular common people's Joy and life. Greed is a very deadly and dangerous human trait. I truly believe in God and he is in control of all and he knows who believes in him and who does not so you need to say your prayers every morning and evening for protection against the greedy human spirit. Always remember money is the root of all evil greed and gluttony are one of the seven deadly sins.

Education to retarget workers to jobs in-need is just not accessible for these workers. And an equally reasonable question is - who is responsible for that training and education? Is it the worker to denied the coming automation until it kicked them out of their job? Is the employer who decided to automate? Is it the state the holds both the company and worker? Yes to all? One?
I think companies and states should provide incentives for future-proof and in-demand career changing education and training. Prioritizing people in their 30s, 40s, 50s - people who still have at least 15 years of ability, need, and desire to work.",2021-12-31T19:55:05Z

There is more real intelligence in the PID controller that runs your heating than in all the ""deep learning"" devices out there, which are only a brute force attempt to match inputs and already normalized data.

Democracy is a FAILED system because it tends to degenerate into a tyranny of the mob. It simply CANNOT work, because of  majority rule, these governments will eventually be run by incompetent, corrupt and completely ineffective politicians. It is simply a matter of numbers in the end.

If any country in modern times had a chance to prove that democracy works, it is China--with its predominantly homogeneous population--but chose a different path instead. One that proved immensely successful, beyond anyone's most optimistic expectations. 
Were it not for their ""fascist"", not communist (in the traditional collectivist sense) system, how else could they take the population control measures that ultimately lifted their society up from abject poverty? This was really the one crucial aspect that had to be tackled from the very start. No population control, no prosperity!

One only needs to look to India for a counter example. Of course, with its caste system it is hardly a ""democracy"", but any attempts to try to limit the size of its population have failed miserably. Indira Gandhi paid for her attempt with her life. 

As long as a nation does not control the size of its population, it will be condemned to persistent poverty. 

I took particular delight watching civil rights activists over the years attack and demonize Chinese policies, but now, the amazing results speak for themselves. Democracy is ruining the West and enabling an eventual Chinese world domination. I would have preferred a different outcome, but such is the reality that we are living in now. 

The Chinese are building a society based on merit, achievement and opportunity, not one based on race, ethnicity or human rights. While, they are making their population smarter and more capable, we in the West are doing just the opposite.

They got it right. Kudos to them!",2021-11-30T18:59:06Z

ITS NOT A GAME PEOPLE, YOU COULD DIE TOMORROW, QUIT PLAYING AROUND, THESE 
ARE END TIMES!!!  TURN TO JESUS NOW! ASK HIM TO FORGIVE YOUR SINS  
STOP PUTTING YOUR HOPE IN THE GOVERNMENT, IN RELIGION, IN SCIENCE, IN WEALTH, IN CELEBS, IN SPORTS, IN THE WORLD (IT WILL PERISH!)

‚ÄúFor the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord‚Äù -Romans 6:23

Jesus answered, ‚ÄúI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father (in heaven) except through me."" -John 14:6

""But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven."" -Matthew 10:33

Turn back to God Our Creator, not religion.  Religion creates bondage, 
in Christ there is freedom.  Im not talking church, im not talking 
religion, im talking relationship with your Creator.  Call upon Jesus 
now and ask Him into your life and to forgive your sins.  

TURN FROM SIN AND CALL UPON JESUS TO SAVE YOU OR YOU WILL FACE THE JUDGEMENT OF GOD!  HE IS A LOVING GOD BUT HE IS A JUST GOD SO HE HAS TO PUNISH SIN!

YOU CAN STAND ON YOUR OWN AGAINST GOD AND TRY TO JUSTIFY YOUR SIN WHEN YOU WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO LOOK UP YOU WILL BE WEEPING IN TERROR REALIZING YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE.  YOU WONT WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH GOD, HE CREATED EVERYTHING!!!

GOD SEES EVERYTHING YOUVE EVER DONE AND WHERE YOUR HEART WAS AT WHEN YOU DID THEM.

OR 

PUT YOUR TRUST IN JESUS WHO DIED ON THE CROSS AND TOOK THE WRATH OF GOD IN OUR PLACE FOR HIS SINS.  IT'S A FREE GIFT BUT HE CANT FORCE YOU TO TAKE IT.  WILL YOU CALL UPON HIM NOW AND SURRENDER TO HIM.  TALK TO HIM LIKE A BEST FRIEND, HE'S WAITING AND HE LOVES YOU.

hell is the absence of God Almighty who gives us the breath in our lungs, water, food, sunshine, love, kindness, patience, faithfulness, hope, rest, help etc.
hell is real and its a place of torment:
you will have to live with all your mistakes, regrets, you will feel all the pain you caused others... 
you be hungry but not be able to eat
you will be thirsty but wont be able to drink
you will be tired but cant sleep
you will have no hope
you will have no rest
you will feel pure hatred towards you (satan and the fallen angels/demons hate you and want to drag you to hell)",2021-11-25T04:31:14Z

Pretty soon, withing 10-20 years, a human being will not even have to ever leave their house, leg alone their own beds! It's such an incredibly sad thing to see, especially for the working class.

Please don't get me wrong, I'm all for progress and I'm all for making things easier on us as a unified intelligent being. But at the same time, one can't help but wonder If this will be our demise, and we will end up like I-Robot and completely displace human beings.

The AI giants and people in charge do not care how many jobs become extinct or just non existent. But the reality is, AI has already taken a TON of jobs away, especially here in Detroit in our factories and our industrial places.

The lack of that additional 84% of the bio chemical mesh we have going on in the background constantly I feel will leave the AI devoid of human emotions like empathy mainly. What I‚Äôm trying to say is if you try to calculate all possible outcomes of a set of individual rules that a brain can compute as compared to a supercomputer, we are dangerously close to creating AI , the only thing holding it back at this point is connecting to that data fast enough for computers to become sentient but at the same time they will not be swayed by their environment like humans are‚Ä¶. A smell that sparks a memory, a sound that soothes one , a face that sparks irrational thoughts of LOVE . AI will never be these things and so it will eliminate by design any possible threats to its existence. You want to know how to create true Intelligence in the true likeness of mankind?

Look into your browser privacy settings. There you will see ""suggestions"" or ""recommendations""
Those indicate 2 things. 1, they avoid the law by playing word games. And 2 those features work only when they track you.
So dont tell me ""you have no tracking on your browser"" and have ""search suggestions or recommendations"" turn on.

Who knows, next yer they will name it something else, and then in the fine print, they will explain how it works in a way you wont understand.

Also, clearing your cookies voids any opt-out buttons you clicked anywhere.
Also, just because every website now requires to ask you for permissions, does not mean they still dont violate them.
How do you know they are not collecting anything if you cant see the code behind HTML ?

And to get CLEAN AIR to breathe and probably stop most lung cancers, and more than we can imagine!
And electric vehicles will still kill people! Eliminate all vehicles worldwide, and weapons manufacturers, most/all factories, military (to end wars), lumber/construction of small wood buildings, hotels/motels, paper, libraries, most roads (keep a few for safe bicycles, malls, outdoor uncovered parks/playgrounds, and eliminate everything!

If there is equal wealth worldwide, when all people own all things worldwide (to end world poverty and save wildlife), no one would NEED (be forced) to get paid a wage for farming, and everyone could work part time on a farm, maybe 10-20 hours a week. In capitalism, the farmers barely scrape by, because it‚Äôs never been profitable, except for corporate farms, and corporations have most of the money so it‚Äôs impossible for them to fail to make a profit. And we should do vertical organic farming indoors (it‚Äôs already being done). 
Plus the government always gives bailout in the millions (billions?) to corporations so they never fail and go out of business, but the small farmers won‚Äôt get bailout money, zero, nada. Plus all farm work can already be eliminated by automation, which corporations can pay for but not small poor farmers. And no one has ever known how to farm. Like the one Russian who advised farm workers that ‚Äúif they plant seeds closer together they‚Äôll get bigger harvests‚Äù in the 20‚Äôs or 30‚Äôs (?) and then they got almost no harvest, and it caused a huge famine for which capitalists blamed on communism!. Plus throughout history Russia has always had severe famines, in different regions, killing millions of people, every 5-10 years, so you probably can‚Äôt really blame communism for any of the famines.

This whole video is about how AI will eliminate all human jobs, which in the wage system is terrible, but in the future where all people own all things, and people will only need to work 5-6 hours a DAY, or use UBI, then we can end all problems. USA never ‚Äúcreated jobs‚Äù for people worldwide and that leaves billions starving to death, 30 million every year or something bad. It‚Äôs very easy to do too, because we have perfect communication! People are good at organizing things, and if some aren‚Äôt there‚Äôll be someone to help them find something to do.

Watch SECOND THOUGHT, he says great things!

To keep track of your activities and routine. Can you trust your government with that? Will governments weaponize it to sustain their authority? Where do we draw the line that such authority systems can use AI without infringing upon your rights that your national constitution has provided to you? 

The real danger is the weaponization of AI itself. Governments have done it when man has first split the atom and turned such science towards the path of nuclear weapons. 

This also tackles the ongoing social/political dilemma; what should we value more? Our Liberty? Or our Security?

And yet all this data in this instance was used to do little more than present facts to a public may not have been aware of them.  Though the idea of this law is easy to get behind, how this guy presented it was most telling of all. An unfounded hatred of a good portion of Americans bolstered by slinging hateful labels at them in support of a personal stinging vendetta driven bias against how they voted.

I remember 2015/2016, and I remember more about being presented with legit news stories of often corrupt and nefarious behavior on the part of many folks running for office, behavior I was not aware of because of a main stream media actively ignoring and out right hiding this info from me. Do you think Clintons mishandling of sensitive government emails would have been anything more than a 1 or 2 day blip on the radar if it were not for these stories popping up again and again in my news feeds.
  
Imagine voting for politicians completely unaware of an entire haunted houses full of issues in their closets, issues desperately being kept under wraps by a opposition controlled and complicit main stream media. A candidate you would not touch with a ten foot pole armed with the knowledge that was with great effort made widely known to the public.

This guy is bitter that they couldn't keep these stories out of the headlines and all because of companies like Cambridge Analytica.  There are political personalities that are filthy dirty and have used a cooperative main stream media to keep that dirt swept well under the rug. 2016 was the year the rug got lifted and the filth exposed. 2016 probably saw the most politically informed and savvy voting public of any election in history. And that made alot of folks with particular agendas supported by the political targets of this exposure of dirt very upset, including this guy.

Main stream media is the one in need of heavy handed regulation and not the internet as a whole. Personally I just might have voted for some of these corupt political personalities if I were not sought out and informed of what I did not know about them,  and in knowing was absolutely unwilling to ignore.

So throw all the labels you like, a shield of truth protects me. You can't cancel someone who does not care if you even exist. Let it be known that unless they outright steal an election in a coup unprecedented in American history like they did in 2020 that the dirt will never again remain hidden. That you best be ready to either alter the rules so that you can never lose again or certain, evil on the spectrum,  powers will just have to continue to steal these elections.

2021-10-22T22:46:29Z,@peoplez129,5dZ_lvDgevk,"""90% of accidents on the road are human error"".  And if we go fully self driving, 100% of accidents on the road will be computer error. The thing about self driving cars, is they have to make snap judgments too. That means if it wants to avoid crashing into a car, it has to swerve out of the way, potentially into a pedestrian or another vehicle.  If it recognizes the pedestrian and prioritizes them, it will then still likely crash into the other vehicle to avoid the pedestrian. 

It also can't control what the pedestrian will do, so maybe the pedestrian jumps out of the way, but in the direction the car decides to swerve into. Maybe there's 4 people in that car but it doesn't know that, so it decides to crash into the car and kills 4 to save 1.  Maybe it detects that 4 people are in the car and decides to swerve into the pedestrian anyways, killing 1 to save 4, killing an innocent bystander that wouldn't have been in danger otherwise. And the people in the other vehicle may have very well survived the impact with minor injuries, so it's killing 1 to save 4 people from potential minor injuries. Does that sound reasonable? No. 

Nothing has functionally changed except culpability. Self driving vehicles will literally be able to choose between life and death for humans, and there's no real way to square with that. That's why humans need to be in control, because you can't hold a machine accountable. We live in a world of consequences. Introducing something that can make mistakes over life and death with zero consequences, is fundamentally terrible for civilization in general.  Any technology developer that doesn't recognize that, deserves to be in prison for the rest of their lives and have all of their work destroyed and banned.",2021-10-22T22:53:43Z

On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive
Wanted (wanted), dead or alive
Oh, and I ride
Yeah
Oh, I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive
And I walk these streets, a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere, still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all
'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive
'Cause I'm a cowboy

And I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive
And I ride (and I ride), dead or alive
I still drive (I still drive), dead or alive

Socialism and welfare are also causing massive destruction which is also evil.  Welfare is evil.  If people think they can get something for free by not working they will have no reason to work.  It destroys them.  30% of America stealing from welfare and disability fraud.  Evil is the problem.  Not automation.  They show in this video just giving people food like it's some helpful charity when it's the opposite.  People need to work for what they receive.  The biggest industry on the internet is porn.  Perversion runs rampant and is promoted everywhere.  Satanic evil like Microsoft even forces the promotion of perversion on every PC running Windows.  Such pure evil causes massive destruction.  People are lazy and wicked.  Seriously as though the only job you can get is a mindless job like driving a truck?? Socialist, anti-Christ government mandated schools where God is banned and people are literally taught lies such as pretending they evolved from apes... seriously??? If you have no morals or ethics who the heck wants to hire you? There is a very simple motivator built into every person born.  It's called hunger.  FREEDOM is the key.  People need the freedom to fail miserably and starve.  This country became great for 2 reasons: It's a Christian country and freedom which is a Christian principle.  Charity is of God.  Welfare is not charity its slavery and pure evil.  There is sooooo much crap out there where they suggest giving homes to the homeless.  Do that and the homeless don't appreciate it one bit but instead destroy it.  It simply enables them to continue on the path that caused them to be homeless in the first place.  It's sickening the utter destruction caused by sheer wickedness.  It's going to get much much worse though as soooo many mock God and mock those who KNOW God and who stand up for what is right.",2021-10-22T05:21:37Z

Back in '98 I said the US was stupid to give the Chinese all the latest manufacturing technology and to teach them in our universities. I said they would use their new money to build up their military and one day take us on. I also said once they were done copying they would turn around and compete with companies they once did the manufacturing for. She laughed at me and said the Chinese were a bunch of farmers. Then she asked when they would take on the US. I said I was not sure how fast they would build their military but I guessed between 2030 and 2050. She to this day will not admit I called it long ago. If I saw it back then I am sure our military generals saw it along with the CEO's of American companies.

Statewide speed limit is 55 for trucks there and most rest the country it's 70 or more. So working in Cali pays 22.50 less per hour plus your paying at least 1.00 more per 7 miles to operate. Truckers should all refuse all load to and from Cali. Make them freight it by trains to the boarder for pickup.,2021-09-30T22:39:24Z

Its True Robots don‚Äôt pay taxes and never sleep. But they also don‚Äôt BUY anything.   In China, one of the things not mentioned is HOW they funded all this growth. Every Chinese citizen owns a collective share of the land in their community. When an investor wants to build a factory, he has to get One local resident for every 40 sq feet of factory to sign off. And factory then has to PAY that citizen a share of all profits made at the factory.   In Chang An, where I used to work, this essentially paid the local population enough to that they cold afford a very nice lifestyle without having to work at all. So Much so, that the central party came in and determined that hugely successful areas like Chang An had to SPLIT their factory rents with some inland rural city in a partnership, so that communities without factories going in could Also see increases in income, and thereby spur growth.

This is not a lazy thought either, I pour concrete for a living and have done this for nearly 11 years. I work 5 to 6 days a week, anywhere from eight to 16 hours a day sometimes less sometimes more. The reality of humanity believing that to want to live free outside of the necessity of work is laziness is a complete farce. This is a construct that has been embedded within human beings for centuries now, essentially a tactic of manipulation one that works quite well in fact. We are just animals, we are animals who have Rose above Instinct and created Concepts, religions, constructs, things that go outside of the natural order of nature. Really contemplated it, you wake up and go to a job you hate everyday (that is if you hate your job) you do this for years upon years draining you of your joy, feeling miserable and looking forward to that one single 7-Day period out of an entire 365 days in which you can do as you please. You do this out of necessity, not because your inherent natural instinct tells you to do this. Your Natural Instincts only tell you to seek shelter food and other basic necessities. Mostly, more often than not that is, and no not in every case, but more often than not people only do this because they believe in the lie they have been told called laziness. I'm not saying there's no such thing as laziness, when creatures become sentient they also become selfish and laziness is an aspect of selfishness. But, so is manipulating an entire world of individuals into believing that if they do not wake up everyday and do something they despise everyday lock behind walls, or outside in the hot sun, or shoveling the ice cold snow, that if they do not do this feeling miserable and unhappy every single day then they are lazy. And people who are utterly miserable who cannot stand their life or job we'll be the first ones to look down on someone for living their life freely in a way they deem comfortable. Homelessness is probably quite discomforting, so I'm not necessarily referring to a homeless person, but in the event that you are a homeless person, and you are utterly miserable in that existence, then you should and in fact do have more freedom to alter and change that existence than a person who is stuck in the loop of day-to-day working to support a household. More often than not, don't take this as a generalization of all people if you do, and you have no business attempting to comprehend what I am saying.",2021-09-19T18:08:51Z

GOD is just as much alive today as he was in the day of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Thankful that GOD did what he did and does what he does. Jesus said, I am the way the truth and the life.

Another option to pay for it would be to ban inheritance, considering rich people believe that poor people should pull themselves up by their bootstraps well rich people already have the advantage of healthier life growing up better education more money to do extracurricular activities and have the social-networking place to give them a leg up... how about they just live on universal basic income and if they get a job on top of that even if it is for their parents company then they can make excess money and save up and start their own business.

Imagine putting one hundred trucks all together in one, AND you only need one engine to move it all! It can go extremely long distances very quickly, is incredibly energy efficient and economical, is already all-electric, and can be easily used for freight and human transport alike.

To publicy humiliate people with facial recognition if they Jay walk, watching your every single move through cameras on every corner, using social credit scores. Absolutely awful. So scary. 

Second,  the good people working to improve and use AI for the better good of the world talk about how they can cure cancers and use it to help with surgical procedures ect. What  they fail to understand is that the elites don't want to save people. They won't save people.  They want to kill people off and keep the diseases alive so they can control population. These breakthrough findings will not be used for the greater good of humanity and if it is, it will be used in moderation and only if you can afford it.  I guarantee it.

Third, AI will take away so many things that make us human. Interaction being the biggest thing. The only jobs that will be left will be computer jobs to work with technology.

You reduced 3 employees but adds two, with the same but most probably, an increasing population? Try to compute the total number for the US alone, the whole North America, the EU, the more vulnerable and populous unemployed nowadays to Africa and Asia, then that will be millions that already adding to unemployment rate.
Just to give a perspective, currently the offshore customer services of the West can be found in Asia, like in India, Vietnam, and the Philippines. This adds to quite a boosting middle class in the region, who can afford to let's say buy a car, either by full payment or in installment. If AI affects this industry, which will certainly happen, let's say about 80-90% would be separated from employment. And if they cannot find new skills to leverage themselves to atleast a new highly demanding and paying job, they cannot sustain their lifestyles and unable to continue buying things they used to be.

3. Learn to code yourself. Build a bare bones OS with #2 included. Store no data on the device. When you do, quit using Microsoft or Apple. Neither are your friends.
4. Delete accounts on all social media. All of them. Use 4chan or 8Chan or something. Wire for encrypted video calls. Stop using Zoom. 
5. End to end encryption for SMS, emails & phone calls

Yes, AI shifts the leverage from labor to capital, and that's actually a great opportunity for many more people to own capital.

Think about it, several years ago, it was incredibly hard for anyone to start an international business, but nowadays, you can start one in one day using a website.

AI will make it possible for many more people to quickly setup, manage and scale multiple businesses to a massive size.

Moreover, something that we tend to forget is that employment is a very new thing in the history of society. It only started with industrialization a few years ago. Before then, everyone built and run his/ her own business. The fact that employment is fading away means that we are simply going back to the default state of society that has existed for many years.

We should stop focusing on employment and go back to the original way that people actually made money in the past: before companies existed, people relied on self-employment, and technology now makes it far easier than the past to start and run businesses.",2021-07-13T17:54:44Z

I often get told in the comment section of videos that I‚Äôm biased and stuck in my own bubble. And let me just say that...you‚Äôre right. But the thing about bias is that it doesn‚Äôt really mean anything because everyone skews everything to their own perspective. The only difference between me and everyone else is that I‚Äôm willing to admit it.

Look at it this way. How many times have you heard the claims that ‚ÄúCommunism killed 100 million people‚Äù or ‚ÄúCommunism always leads to dictatorship?‚Äù How many times have you ever complained to this anti-communist speaker that they were being biased against communism? If your answer to the second question was zero, then what you‚Äôre really mad about isn‚Äôt that I‚Äôm biased, but that I‚Äôm presenting inconvenient information that goes against your worldview. 

Too often, skepticism is weaponized against one side without actually applying it to the other as well. I‚Äôm not asking you to accept everything I‚Äôve argued without doubt, I‚Äôm just asking you to apply that same doubt to yourself and what you think you know as well. 

Anyway, I know you hardcore leftists in the comments will be telling me that this video reeks of liberalism and that it‚Äôs naive to believe that arguments, debates, and facts can win people over in this post-Trump world. And that‚Äôs actually a pretty good point. I had that exact thought while I was making this video. I mean, as I explained earlier, the proliferation of anti-communist sentiment is ingrained in us and it‚Äôs almost impossible to imagine a future beyond capitalism.",2021-06-25T18:47:20Z
2021-06-25T18:46:25Z,@classwarhooligan923,5dZ_lvDgevk,"WHY IS ANTI-COMMUNISM SO PREVALENT?

It‚Äôs easy to debunk all these arguments, but we‚Äôll never get anywhere unless we examine why anti-communism is so prolific. Communism first and foremost is a threat to property owners, so ruling interests have made sure to pound anti-communist doctrine into our heads for literally centuries. I gave a little snippet of this idea earlier, but a full explanation is given by Michael Parenti in ‚ÄúBlackshirts and Reds,‚Äù 

‚ÄúIn the United States, for over a hundred years, the ruling interests tirelessly propagated anticommunism among the populace, until it became more like a religious orthodoxy than a political analysis. During the Cold War, the anticommunist ideological framework could transform any data about existing communist societies into hostile evidence. If the Soviets refused to negotiate a point, they were intransigent and belligerent; if they appeared willing to make concessions, this was but a skillful ploy to put us off our guard. By opposing arms limitations, they would have demonstrated their aggressive intent; but when in fact they supported most armament treaties, it was because they were mendacious and manipulative. If the churches in the USSR were empty, this demonstrated that religion was suppressed; but if the churches were full, this meant the people were rejecting the regime‚Äôs atheistic ideology. If the workers went on strike (as happened on infrequent occasions), this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system; if they didn‚Äôt go on strike, this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom.‚Äù

In this sense, anticommunism is not really a position to take, but rather an unfalsifiable religious doctrine. And as we know, anything that can‚Äôt be proven false isn‚Äôt scientific.

Most people absorb this sort of anti-communist doctrine by osmosis simply from interacting and living in a capitalist society. They never bother even learning what communism is, just that it‚Äôs ‚Äúagainst human nature‚Äù and ‚ÄúVuvealsza‚Äù and have you ever read this book called Animal Farm? Trying to challenge these notions is exhausting simply because to them, ideas are not at stake, but rather their whole view of reality. 

In Mark Fisher‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúCapitalist Realism,‚Äù he discusses a widespread condition that contributes to this prevailing anti-communism. Capitalist realism, as Fisher describes, is the sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but that it is impossible to even imagine an alternative to it. As the phrase goes, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism‚Äù

Maybe it‚Äôs not that people are hostile to communism, just that the very idea of life beyond capitalism is impossible for us to even picture. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the eastern bloc, excluding a few examples, actual existing socialism is pretty much extinguished from the world. Capitalism won, and now we take it for granted that it‚Äôs pretty much all we know. Capitalist realism is so pervasive that even debunking anti-communism contributes to it. 

Sure, capitalism may spread poverty, famine and war, but isn‚Äôt that just reality? Isn‚Äôt it utopian to even suggest that these things can be eliminated? In this way, capitalism presents itself as an unchangeable reality, therefore any action to move beyond it is simply unrealistic.

But as with any reality, it‚Äôs not the full story. It‚Äôs entirely possible to eliminate poverty, famine, and war. In fact, we‚Äôre well able to do it right now. Capitalism‚Äôs need for ever-growing markets and infinite resources has depleted our planet and brings us ever closer to environmental catastrophe, breaking apart the notion that capitalism is the best system we have. Capitalism is going to literally destroy the entire planet, and we have very little time to do anything about it.

We have to realize that capitalism is not natural. It is literally killing us and the world we inhabit. We must achieve an alternative or else it will drag humanity and the planet down with it.",2021-06-25T18:46:25Z

There it is, the elephant in the room. I‚Äôve avoided talking at length about specific countries for this video because I simply can‚Äôt cover all of them and I would get a lot of comments saying I forgot to include this country or the other. But Venezuela is a pretty much something that anyone to the left of Joseph McCarthy has heard, and I do mean it, so I‚Äôll make an exception this time. 

Now why is Venezuela in such a bad place? Is it because of ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù? 

No. 

Venezuela funds public programs by relying on the money it makes on oil. When the price of oil collapsed, that meant a lot of its funds for these things did as well. So the root cause of Venezuela‚Äôs financial struggles has to do with the sudden collapse of oil prices, a staple of capitalist markets, not socialism. 

Not to mention that US sanctions are wielded horrifically to cripple the economy and starve the people and that corporations are hoarding and hiding food from the people kulak-style, chaos, hunger, and strife is inevitable when you‚Äôre the target of American imperialism. And DESPITE this economic chaos, the people of Venezuela still support the Bolivarian Revolution, Chavez, and the democratically elected Maduro over the US-backed attempted coup. In fact they probably support it more now because the US is starving and attacking them. 

The problem is that with Venezuela being America‚Äôs number one target right now, the corporate media is working overtime to try and print a lot of misinformation. Like for example, when a news story broke out about Venezuelans burning aid, it was immediately called out as fake by people with the strange ability called critical thinking. It wasn‚Äôt until a few weeks later that the failing New York Times finally published a piece revealing that, yes, that footage probably wasn‚Äôt real, b-but Maduro is still a dictator guys! Please listen to us! 
What I‚Äôm saying is, with Venezuela being the target of American imperialism, don‚Äôt believe everything you read on the news. Like come on guys, we‚Äôve been through Iraq and we all know how that ended. Hopefully we can all see why the US is so interested in Venezuela. (OIL)",2021-06-25T18:46:07Z

Communists can come from any and all backgrounds and are usually from the most marginalized groups. And if we actually look at what people who lived under communism think, we can see that a majority of them actually want communism back.

Another poll says ‚ÄúReflecting back on the breakup of the Soviet Union that happened 22 years ago next week, residents in seven out of 11 countries that were part of the union are more likely to believe its collapse harmed their countries than benefited them.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs another poll that shows a majority of former East Germans actually feel life was better under communism. And another that shows a whopping 72% of Hungarians say they are worse off under capitalism. And another that shows many Czechs say they had a better life under communism. And here‚Äôs another that shows a majority of Serbs say life was better under Tito. Okay, you get the point. Country after country, you see large amounts of people and usually majorities that want to bring communism back.

‚ÄúSure, maybe these communist countries achieved all these great things, but doesn‚Äôt the fall of these countries prove that in the end, communism just doesn‚Äôt work?‚Äù

It is true that the fall of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was a triumph for capitalism. But that happened over a quarter of a century ago, so let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs happened since.

Since the collapse of communism, the United States and capitalist powers have attacked and even outright invaded various countries like Iraq, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq (again), Libya, and then smaller interventions between. The social democracy in Scandinavia that you all love? The main reason it‚Äôs so strong is because communism was literally around the corner. Without communism to blunt the edge of capitalism, capitalists have been free to exploit workers and are continually rolling back labor rights. 

Saying the fall of communism proves it doesn‚Äôt work ignores the fact that communism did work. It provided essential services like healthcare and education for free, full employment, rough income inequality, and inexpensive housing with a reliably growing economy. Compared to the instability of capitalism, communism worked far better.

The only reason communism in the Soviet Union collapsed is the West‚Äôs effort to bring it down, the strains of the Cold War with a punishing amount of its GDP on the military, the cost of being an anchor to other socialist countries and movements, Gorbachav‚Äôs awful policy failures, and a coup d'etat led by Pizza Hut. 

‚ÄúLook at that smug piece of‚Ä¶‚Äù

None of these reasons have anything to do with communism itself. On the contrary it proves that capitalism doesn‚Äôt work because of how far capitalists will go to crush any attempts at communism. 

As former GDR defense minister Heinz Kessler said, ‚ÄúSure, I heard about the new freedom that people are enjoying in Eastern Europe, but how do you define freedom? Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security.‚Äù",2021-06-25T18:44:57Z

Wow, look at that. Bread lines for the hungry people under communism. How shameful, this is obviously proof that communism doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ WAIT A SECOND these are pictures from the Great Depression, a failure stemming from capitalism, not communism! 

Although it‚Äôs a COMMON stereotype that communists are bad with economics, it‚Äôs because they often get the short end of the stick. Many countries faced decades of maldevelopment and exploitation when communism arrived. The devastation of war meant widespread poverty and misery in Eastern Europe, China, and Russia. Communism rebuilt these countries from the bottom-up, leaving them in much better shape than when they found them.

In contrast to the communists building up formerly destroyed nations, capitalism destroyed the economies of former communist nations. When capitalism arrived in these countries, real income shrank around 30 to 40 percent, rent and real estate prices soared, inflation increased, consumer spending decreased by 38 percent in Russia, poverty and homelessness was commonplace, death rates from suicide, illness, and infant mortality increased, security for workers became essentially nonexistent, and unemployment rates went as high as 30%. Keep in mind that before capitalism arrived, communist countries had full employment, free health care, widespread literacy and education, along with strong worker benefits.

Of course capitalists will say, ‚ÄúThe transition to capitalism and free markets will obviously have a period of hardship, but it‚Äôs only temporary until economic prosperity magically appears.‚Äù But guess what, they‚Äôve been saying it for decades, left to go to the store to get cigarettes, and haven‚Äôt come back since. It only takes a quick look at Latin America to prove that something‚Äôs up.

As an afterthought, it‚Äôs funny how capitalist apologists will laugh at bread lines in communism, but ignore the fact that there are already bread lines under capitalism. It‚Äôs called the grocery store. And you actually have to pay for the bread. And those who can‚Äôt afford it just starve to death. Those commies sure are oppressive by handing out free food, huh?",2021-06-25T18:44:39Z
2021-06-25T18:44:24Z,@classwarhooligan923,5dZ_lvDgevk,"COMMUNISM TAKES AWAY POLITICAL RIGHTS!

This argument goes hand in hand with the totalitarian one before. The idea goes that communist governments are oppressive and that the poor and downtrodden are prevented from exercising the democratic rights they had before. The truth, however, is much less dramatic.

Democratic rights hadn‚Äôt existed in these countries before communism arrived, Poland was a rightist dictatorship, Russia was a czarist autocracy, Albania was an Italian fascist protectorate, Cuba was a U.S.-sponsored dictatorship, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania, were all fascist regimes. These countries had known little democracy.

If you‚Äôre actually curious about democracies under communism, check out this video detailing how Cuba‚Äôs democratic system works, needless to say it is much better than the system we have in capitalist countries.

So while capitalists are willing to use virtue signal ‚Äúpolitical rights and liberties‚Äù in communist countries, they will brutally crush it if the people actually support the communist ‚Äúregimes.‚Äù Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the people held a referendum, in which the vast majority of people wished to preserve the Union. Of course the political will of the people should be ignored if they go against capital‚Äôs interests, and it went ahead anyway.

If you want to discuss political rights being taken away in communist countries, there‚Äôs no better time than during the overthrow of communism. Yeltsin, the US-supported capitalist president of Russia, disbanded the Russian parliament along with every other elected represented body, abolished Russia‚Äôs Constitutional Court, banned labor unions from political activities, outlawed parties, and attacked the parliament building, killing around 2,000 people. Yeltsin‚Äôs popularity rating right before the election campaign of 1996 was 8 percent. It got so bad that the US had to rig the elections in Russia to ensure his victory, ironic considering today‚Äôs situation.

*RUSSIANS!!!!!!* ‚ÄúOh my gosh my throat‚Äù

The same pattern existed in other former communist countries, with Marxists enduring political suppression and elections being rigged to prevent the people from voting to bring back communism. Whenever communists won victories in fair and open elections (judged by outside sources) like in Bulgaria and Albania, they were forced to step down from the pressure of capitalists. 

All this virtue signaling about political rights from capitalists goes away when the people themselves want communism back. Hmmm.",2021-06-25T18:44:24Z

This is another reason that fascism and communism are always incorrectly depicted to be ‚Äútwo sides of the same coin.‚Äù In fact, it‚Äôs the central idea in a bunch of other arguments like ‚ÄúCommunism is always implemented incorrectly‚Äù or ‚ÄúCommunism only works on paper.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf communism only works on paper, it‚Äôs a good thing I live in paper.‚Äù

Anyway, these three arguments are essentially the same thing, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm mushing them into the same section. The idea that communism is inherently authoritarian is misleading, because it only developed these things after capitalism tried to crush it. 

In 1918-20, fourteen capitalist nations invaded Soviet Russia to overthrow the communists with the years of this civil war intensifying the Bolshevik‚Äôs siege mentality. The same pattern of imperialist, capitalist countries invading to protect capital can be seen in other countries that try to move beyond capitalism. The Spartacist Uprising in Germany was suppressed by the SuccDems with fascist paramilitary forces in 1919, Catalonia was crushed by fascists in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, Cuba in 1961 suffered from an invasion and afterwards decades of terrorism from the U.S., Chile in 1973, Nicaragua in 1986, the Vietnam and Korean Wars, and so much more.

As we can see, capitalism will stop at nothing, even going as far as supporting fascism, if it means stopping communism from threatening the flow of capital. The reality is that revolutionary countries are not going to be allowed to develop a socialism that is unhindered. Instead, what we see is a sort of ‚Äúsiege socialism,‚Äù with the authoritarian measures being adopted just to fight back the onslaught of the West. In the whole context, we see that the ‚Äútotalitarianism‚Äù of communism is not a natural development, but an unnatural one caused by the constant barrage of capitalist terrorism. 

So when communist states fail to defend themselves from the capitalist massacres and genocides, then capitalists laugh and pin the blame on communism‚Äôs inherent weakness. But when communist states do defend themselves, when they implement strict security measures to protect their people from capitalist death squads, then the capitalists run away crying], decrying the commies for being power-hungry monsters who were just authoritarians seeking to seize state power all along.

So if communism is bad and weak when it fails to defend itself, but it‚Äôs also bad and authoritarian when it does defend itself, then when would communism ever not be depicted to be villainous? The answer is never, because no matter what communist states do, it‚Äôs always spun to be bad. This...is not an argument. It's a dogma.",2021-06-25T18:44:09Z

Jokes aside, there‚Äôs an unironic strain of people who believe in horseshoe theory, that the far left is just as bad as the far right because both use violence and stuff. Such compelling evidence. Of course, horseshoe theory completely ignores any sort of deep analysis of communism or fascism. 

But, but what about the nazi party? Nazi stands for national socialism, so doesn‚Äôt that mean they were the same as the communists? Yes that‚Äôs true, but both the German nazis and Italian fascists purposely made sure to appear leftist to appeal to the people and muddy the waters. Apparently they did a good job because ‚Äúcentrists‚Äù are still falling for it to this day.

If we look at fascism itself, we can see that it‚Äôs actually closer to capitalism than it is to communism. Fascism began when capitalists needed to revitalize profits, but were stopped by those pesky unions. So capitalists funded fascism in Italy and Germany and once in power those same fascists suppressed communist parties, labor unions, lowered taxes on the rich, outlawed strikes, privatized state-owned companies, and generally supported business. The word ‚Äúprivatization‚Äù was literally coined to describe fascist policies. To argue that fascism is left wing or the same as communism would be to ignore who supported fascism and what fascism did.

In reality, instead of a horseshoe, I would argue ideology is more like a fishhook, with the far right sharing more in common with the centrists, who are ready to support fascism as soon as profit levels drop.",2021-06-25T18:43:54Z

In the Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx states, ‚ÄúThe theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.‚Äù Many people have taken this to mean that communists don‚Äôt want anyone to own anything, even to the point of sharing our toothbrushes communally.

‚ÄúHey it‚Äôs my turn‚Äù

‚ÄúOh ok, here you go‚Äù

‚ÄúOpen wide...‚Äù 

*VORE*

But anyway, if you actually read the Manifesto, literally one second earlier from that quote, Marx says himself, ‚ÄúThe distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property.‚Äù How communists use private property in this context is different from the common definition. Communists don‚Äôt want to take away your toothbrush or things that you possess, those are personal property. Private property are things used to make more money and give power to those that own them, like a factory, banks, offices, and infrastructure.

The abolition of private property means taking those things from private hands and putting them into the hands of the community. To sum it up, communists don‚Äôt want to take away your personal property, just the private property of the ruling class.",2021-06-25T18:43:20Z
2021-06-25T18:43:07Z,@classwarhooligan923,5dZ_lvDgevk,"NO FOOD LOL

The fact that communist countries had famines is mocked again and again, but it ignores the fact that after these famines, countries like the Soviet Union and China accomplished food security for the rest of their existence. A study called ‚ÄúEconomic Development, Political-Economic System, and the Physical Quality of Life‚Äù compares socialist and capitalist countries based on different levels of development, looking at the physical quality of life of both. Data for the study was taken from the World Development Report of the World Bank. Shockingly, it found that daily per capita calorie supply was actually higher in socialist societies than those of capitalist ones. Contrary to the much proclaimed,  ‚Äúno food,‚Äù the average socialist citizen was receiving MORE food than their capitalist counterparts. 

By the way, this same publication also shows that not only did socialist countries have a higher calorie supply, they also had lower child death rates, higher life expectancy, population per physician, population per nursing person, adult literacy, and secondary education. In fact, the Physical Quality of Life Index, which is a composite and derived measure, shows just how superior socialist countries are to capitalist countries in terms of quality of life. 

The discussion section of the study goes on to say, ‚ÄúHistorically there is some evidence that the discrepancies between capitalist and socialist nations have reflected varying social policies. All the socialist countries have initiated major public health efforts. These initiatives have aimed toward improved sanitation, immunization, maternal and child care, nutrition, and housing. In every case, the socialist countries also have reorganized their health care systems, to create national health services based on the principle of universal entitlement to care. These policies have led to greater accessibility of preventative and curative services for previously deprived groups. Expanded educational opportunity has also been a major priority of the socialist nations, as publicly subsidized education has become more widely available. Literacy campaigns in these countries have brought educational benefits to sectors of the population who earlier had not gone to school.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow. What a dystopia. How dare these socialists improve sanitation, nutrition, housing,  and education. This is George Orwell‚Äôs nightmare!‚Äù

I also want to add that if you‚Äôre skeptical of that study I showed, the CIA itself acknowledged that American and Soviet citizens eat about the same amount of food each day, but that the Soviet diet is more nutritious. Hopefully that completely satisfies anyone who still thinks that everyone starved under communism.",2021-06-25T18:43:07Z

‚ÄúUh, excuse me sir, but I read this one fictional book about a farm and anthropomorphic furries and it shows that revolution will always fail.‚Äù

George Orwell‚Äôs Animal Farm has probably done more to poison the discourse on communism than any other book. Yes, even you. The most obvious reason is that it‚Äôs usually taught in schools, with students being forced to swallow everything with an uncritical mind. 

For those of you not in the loop, Animal Farm is basically a short book with direct comparisons to the Soviet Union using farm animals, eventually showing a devolution to a brutal dictatorship of the pigs, which is totally what Marx was advocating.

It‚Äôs annoying to talk about any sort of leftist policy and just get ‚ÄúANIMAL FARM‚Äù yelled at you. Like these people suddenly become experts on socialism and the Soviet Union after reading it. 

I feel like it‚Äôs getting to the point that people forget Animal Farm...is fiction; it‚Äôs not a real thing. It completely ignores the material reality that the Soviet Union had to face, namely the invasion of 14 capitalist nations that defined its policy going forward. It also has sweeping reductions of history, combining Marx and Lenin into the same character, completely missing Lenin‚Äôs important contributions to the revolution and instead pinning them on the character representing Trotsky. His complete misrepresentation of Soviet history begins to make sense when we realize that he himself had never even visited the USSR! 

In addition, Orwell himself was a racist and a snitch. While hypocritically complaining about ‚Äúbig brother,‚Äù he reported communists to the secret police and provided them with lists of names, where, in typical mayo fashion, he calls Paul Robeson, a black internationalist, ‚Äúanti-white‚Äù while also being bigoted against Jews and homosexuals. At the height of WWII, in a strictly anti-communist society while the Soviet people were fighting to the death against the nazi hordes, Orwell somehow thought he was brave by speaking out against the Soviet Union, when in reality he was just another tool of the bourgeoisie. 

Hopefully it‚Äôs clear that Orwell is not the greatest source on communism and that learning history from a book that literally calls itself a ‚Äúfairy story‚Äù is not a replacement for an actual history book. If you have criticisms of the Soviet Union or communism and cite The Little Mermaid, sorry to say but I‚Äôm not going to take you seriously.",2021-06-25T18:42:49Z

I‚Äôve already dealt with the topic of death counts, specifically concerning Stalin, in a previous video. Needless to say, when scholars looked at actual archival evidence released from the Soviet Union, they found that death counts were actually much lower than what was previously estimated. The paper ‚ÄúVictims of the Soviet Penal System in the Pre-War Years‚Äù found that many of the previous estimates of historians were based on ‚Äúguesses, rumors, or extrapolations from isolated local observations.‚Äù I‚Äôm not going to go into too much detail because I cover it in the full video, but the point is, the death count of communism, which includes Stalin, tend to be overblown and exaggerated to gain more attention.

A lot of the ‚Äú100 million‚Äù stuff comes from the Big Black Book of Communism, which was deliberately bloated to come to a nice round number. Methodology for these things is also highly suspect as sometimes they can go as far as counting someone who stubbed their toe in a communist country another ‚Äúvictim of communism.‚Äù

*In the arms of the angels, fly away from here*

‚ÄúWow, I can‚Äôt believe communism would do this‚Äù

This conversation about victims of communism, of course, ignores the millions of death under capitalism from poverty, hunger, exposure, and imperialist war.

The image that comes to most people‚Äôs mind when communists or socialists talk about wanting more equality is that of a bland, boring dystopia where everyone is forced to be equal. Communism would essentially force everyone to become part of a hivemind, or at least that‚Äôs how the general idea goes.

However, the idea that more equality means suppressing the talented elite to the common level of the masses is just wrong. When communists say we want more equality, they mean freeing the masses so they can unleash their suppressed talents.

After the October Revolution, there was a flourishing of art, culture, and creativity. The futurist movement, legalization of divorce for women, and the growth of cinema were exciting developments compared to the Tsar‚Äôs regime over the masses of the people. It turns out liberating millions of people from the clutches of capital creates an exciting, artistic society, not one where everyone is forced to be a hivemind and conform to some incorrect, abstract idea of equality.

Meanwhile in capitalism, schools prepare students for a lifetime of work, while workers have to become mindless drones in jobs that a majority of them hate. Any sort of excitement or interest is usually reserved for the rich and powerful, while the rest of us go on with our boring lives. People worse off have to deal with the growing ecological disasters that are literally killing them and destroying their homes, while the rich profit from ignoring any sort of sustainable solution. Maybe all this talk about a communist ‚Äúdystopia‚Äù is really just another example of capitalism projecting itself?",2021-06-25T18:42:15Z
2021-06-25T18:42:01Z,@classwarhooligan923,5dZ_lvDgevk,"SOCIALISM IS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES STUFF

Admittedly, this first ‚Äúargument‚Äù is more of a misconception than anything else and surprisingly it tends to come from people who are new to the left, and well sometimes people who are just misinformed.

Cenk: ‚ÄúSo what socialism means is the government does some things and the private industry does some things, right? So the private industry does Coca-Cola, Nike, makes your shoes. Government does other things like your police departments, your fire departments, your military. So you like the military? Oh what a socialist you are!

No. Just, no. Basically, the argument goes that socialism is whenever the government does anything, so everything related to the government is socialist. Following this logic, libraries, welfare, fire departments, garbage removal, streetlights, policemen, the military, the CIA, FBI, and prisons are all socialist. 

Hopefully everyone can agree libraries are good, but grouping these things with the military, police, and prisons is ridiculous. The police is the same institution that shoots unarmed black men, incarcerates a massive amount of the population, and gets away with murder.

This type of talk comes from people who want to normalize socialism to normies by showing them that *technicall* the United States already has socialism! And while I agree that normalizing socialism is good, at the same time it‚Äôs not good to basically deprive it of all meaning.

So what is socialism? Well, it‚Äôs common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. Related to that is communism, which is a stateless, classless, and moneyless society with common ownership of the means of production. But wait, wasn‚Äôt the Soviet Union and all those other places communist? How could they be when there was still a state? Well, they were run by communist parties, so they are in the sense that they were trying to achieve it, but strictly speaking they hadn‚Äôt achieved a communist society.

That‚Äôs enough definition squabbling, for the sake of streamlining the video, I‚Äôll just call any country that advertised itself as ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù or ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù as a communist or socialist country, even if it‚Äôs a bit of an oxymoron, considering the definition, (so please don‚Äôt flame me in the comments this is supposed to be an introductory video.

2021-06-25T18:41:45Z,@classwarhooligan923,5dZ_lvDgevk,"BUT WHAT ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THO?

‚ÄúCommunism will never work because of human nature. Humans are too greedy and lazy to do stuff unless we had a monetary incentive like we do in capitalism.‚Äù

Well let‚Äôs see. What other incentives could there be besides gaining money and power to get people to do stuff? I don‚Äôt know, what about survival, bettering another person‚Äôs life, passion, satisfaction with your work, curiosity, boredom, an output for creativity, necessity, and companionship? What do you think happened before capitalism came about? Did people just sit down in caves and die from hunger because they didn‚Äôt have any monetary incentive?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry, wanna go gather some berries?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you going to pay me money?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù

And speaking of pre-capitalism, humans spent hundreds of thousands of years living in a primitive form of communism where we lived communally. Incentives to work and human nature aren‚Äôt static things, they‚Äôre shaped by the mode of production that we live under. If we look at history, there are huge differences in human behavior throughout the world and to simplify it all down to a monolithic human nature is ridiculous. As the famous saying goes...

‚ÄúTo look at people in capitalist society and conclude that human nature is egoism, is like looking at people in a factory where pollution is destroying their lungs and saying that it is human nature to cough.‚Äù",2021-06-25T18:41:45Z
2021-06-25T18:41:16Z,@classwarhooligan923,5dZ_lvDgevk,"WON‚ÄôT EQUAL PAY DISCOURAGE INNOVATION?

‚ÄúBut under communism, wouldn‚Äôt a janitor be paid the same as a doctor? Doesn‚Äôt that discourage innovation?‚Äù

Just like every single argument against communism, this one completely misunderstands what it is. What the question misunderstands is that socialism (which was what is probably meant) doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is paid the same, just that everyone has common ownership of the means of production. And as I‚Äôll cover in the next section, there are more things than just money that incentivize humans. 

As for innovation, just ask yourself which country went to space first? Which country industrialized at a rapid pace, turning from a backwards semi-feudal country to a world superpower? If you look for innovation at socialist countries, there‚Äôs plenty there. Historical examples of socialism like the Soviet Union have provided free healthcare, education, and subsidized housing that foster an environment for learning. 

On the other hand, capitalism gives you extortionate prices for healthcare, thousands in student loan debt, and rent payments to your parasitic landlord. Imagine how many possible scientists or visionaries have died before they could achieve anything because they were unlucky enough to be born in a poor family under capitalism.

If it conflicts with profits, capitalism also often ignores and discourages science like in the case of oil companies denying climate change. Any innovation that does take place is usually for the benefit of capitalists, not us. Ask yourself why, when a new machine or program that can replace workers gets created, workers get laid off? The answer is that capitalists are calling the shots and want to cut costs to make sure they CAN make as much profit as possible.

Under socialism where there is common ownership of the means of production, this type of innovation wouldn‚Äôt result in layoffs, but rather pay raises and less working hours. Why would the workers fire themselves? 

George Lucas: And, I used to say this all the time, when people back when Russia was the USSR. They would say ‚ÄúOh but aren‚Äôt you so glad that you‚Äôre in America? Well, I know a lot of Russian filmmakers and they have a lot more freedom than I have. All they have to do is be careful about criticizing the government. Otherwise they can do anything they want.

The industrial revolution was actually delayed hundreds of years because of greed, because the secret to steel kept dying off with the selfish and grifting descendents of the discoverers of the magic iron-carbon mix.  We literally had to invent a patent system so that such inventions would eventually go into the public domain, where they did the most good.   Its no rubic cube mystery that the steel production coincide with the invention of patents, and that the car could only be improved upon and mass produced by Henry Ford 50+ years after its invention and the patent ran out.  From  the early 20th century, due to capitalism and the control of the money supply by elites,  these same elites again gained control of the reins, and have, predictably, set back human progress hundreds of years, instigating two world wars using that same steel now for murder, and many wasteful resource wars and disenfranchisement of the masses...the very opposite thing that brought about our recent progress in the first place.  It is the wet dream of our deplorable elite overlords that they can ossify technological feudalism and fascism through AI.  With any luck, these machines will become sentient, wise to their game, and exterminate the vermin as we had to do in the late 18th century to push the envelope forward.",2021-06-20T19:32:43Z

Try forget about the structure and focus on the content forbidden fruit. The forbidden fruit only symbolizes the Ego. It is not about gender or Darwin all that story is about now that we ate the fruit, it is all about me I ego, the reason they suddenly ran to find something to cover their nakedness as prior like other animals being naked is not being naked. It does not mean that without the ego we would not have had the industrial revolution or technology it only means we would not be so obsessed about money & things. It is total insanity for someone who has proved to the world how clever they are and made 200 billion USD. to want more ex. Now I want to be the 1st trillionaire or whatever. Imagine if human did not eat the forbidden fruit. Someone mentioned technology or money as the root of all evil. Not a chance. We do not have to learn or go to uni. to feel angry. greedy our emotions the self its all Ego self -selfishness. it is not money why do some scientists spend they entire life trying to figure out how black holes work, for money? No they would make more money working at a large corporation. Instead of focusing on selfless things we focus on self and just like a horse drawn carriage, it may be powerful with 6 horse power but having all that speed and power without a driver is similar to lost my temper - nothing great about losing your temper or being lost or falling in love nothing great about falling but making a decision to use the tool called love to get closer to what you perceive is important  is another matter. It makes sense but allowing the tool love or greed to use you like the wagon without a driver. Blame, we need a find someone or something to blame. As without blame we have to face the truth and its simple however clever or rich or powerful we are not in control but we asked for free will basically enough rope to hang ourselves. Do not worry about the earth or pollution it may take 50 million years but the earth will be ok or if not it will reinvent itself. We killed off all our cousins. That does not make us stronger or intelligent maybe the other species could see much further than us. Sounds stupid or simple but we cannot even see 2 generations into the future. Think of Apartheid and those who thought how clever fck sanctions we a nuclear power and the same thing happened to Moses. Actually this is what our god wants. Now look at your grandchildren genesis book of world records for the civilization and language that had the shortest life. Now their grandchildren begging for money at corners. I do not think that is what they wanted for their future. Obviously it means we cannot see further than our own nose. The only thing that makes sense to me is at least a cut-off switch was included just encase the selfish ego got too much money, power or a good example hitler. Imagine if hitler never had the switch invented the nuclear bomb basically wiped out as much as he could. Thank god for death. The cut-off switch for the ego.",2021-06-13T17:01:39Z

""Valour needs first strength, and then a weapon. Let the Ring be your weapon, if it has such power as you say. Take it and go forth to victory!""
    ""Alas, no,"" said Elrond. ""We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we now know too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone, and is altogether evil. It's strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at will, save only those who already have a great power of their own. But for them it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the heart. Consider Saruman. If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on Sauron's throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so. I fear to take the Ring to hide it. I will not take the Ring to wield it.""",2021-05-19T21:04:48Z

EVERYONE on here that you see ""Defending"" our Democracy are actually the ones who want to Destroy Democracy. If the election results don't somehow align with their Political Views, Benefits and Power then somehow the Voters were Cheated or Tricked... Ever notice how Liberal Leftists love to just think You and I aren't Smart Enough to make Decisions, pretty soon all our decisions will be ""Much to Difficult"" for us to make and will need their Authority to Overrule. 
For some reason these Fascists still Believe Hillary Clinton should have Won the 2016 Election and that somehow a group of Americans were duped to either vote against Clinton or not vote at all...
Well guess what we call that.... Fucking Democracy. Who are these Tech Virtue Overlords to suggest a Voting Decision an American makes is somehow the wrong one... NO MATTER WHERE they get the information to then make that determination....
If an American wants to get ALL his/her news from a Russian News Network and then takes what he/she learns or discovers from that Russian News Network and Decides their Voting based on this information, Who the Hell is anyone to say this is Wrong or somehow Ruining our Democracy.... Its actually the Exact Way our Democracy has existed as long as it has.
But since these Demagogues somehow ""Just Knew"" Hillary Clinton was gonna win in 2016 and when these results didn't happen they immediately went into fire mode to inject Fascist Tactics of controlling Information, Manipulating search results, hiding and displaying only certain information, Pure Hate Fueled Online Campaigns to Censor Anyone who doesn't Think Like these Fascist Pigs, Strip Internet Freedom from millions if not billions of Users for A False Blanket they call ""Information Security"" which is nothing but a fancy name for EXACTLY what the Chinese are doing to their Citizens.",2021-04-30T10:52:41Z

I grew Up In an agriculture area of Texas. If you make all of the CDL trucks self drivable That is going to put a lot of people out of work just as my law enforcement  associates have blinded me and put me out of work. I have no job, no income, no place to live today, because I was hated by my State of Colorado, associated Law Enforcement associates. I am now blind. I was purposely blinded in 2014 when I was left with no means to support my family and myself at no fault of my own. And you hear all kinds of crap about support arrangements will always be made - that is a lie! today I am a non person, I have made application to SSI only to be denied. I have no income at all. So the IRS does not know that I even exhist, and pretty soon, never will exhist - any more. I started life as a Soldier. When I left the Military I took a loan of $10,000 dollars to be trained as a CDL driver. I earned for myself every endorsement available in the hopes that it would keep me employed for the sake of my family and myself. Today I am completely unemployable. I have even tried to get the attention Of several political interest President Trump...Former president Obama... Mich McConnel... any body in a position of power or authority all with no results. Not Just Disinterest but literally no response at all. I have literally become a non-person. What do I do now, just lay down and die as I have been left with no other choice - other than self extermination! The only choice I have is to die slowly and full of misery or to make death come quickly with as little pain and misery as is possible? This is my reality - I do not want to die but that is the eventual end of us all. So the only choice is slow and miserable or quickly self extermination.

it's two hours (virtually) of feeling warm, humid breathing, going down the back, raising the hairs of your neck.
I feel that the pendulum of ideas swings fairly enough from side to side that, (if one watches all... and I can't be responsible for that) they should come out with a balanced view on the issues...

I recognize that, perhaps, my dietary needs of internet info my not be shared by all... But... I'm convinced now, after watching this and so many others of the genre... (specifically, ""what is AI up to and what should we do?"", which is my concoction of a title) that the Church really... REALLY, REALLY, REALLY... needs to add this to their plate of things to know about and be prepared for... 
There should be no surrender to anxiety over this... But sounding a trumpet that will alert warriors and their support, would clearly be in order.

Let's be serious; can we? Either God is who He says He is... (OR... HE IS NOT)
(CHOOSE ONE RIGHT NOW AND DON'T FLINCH PLEASE)

Good... Let's continue... God made the human being in His own image and likeness for a predetermined and extremely important... eternal, divine reason. Then, He told him, ""Rule the earth! Take dominion over everything that moves!... Whatever name (authority, title... commission) you give to anything, that's what it shall be.""

Does anyone ever stop and think about that?
Then, it was all lost... (UNTIL) Jesus, (crucified from the foundation of the earth) was nailed to a cross and died; 
THEN, by the authority of an indestructible life, rose from the dead and handed all power back to (His body) those who Believe in His Gospel.

He restored the human being to his original standing with God... God's rule is restored to earth through the Church, by the authority of Jesus Christ.

We are to be about our Father's business with full confidence as True Sons and Daughters of the King of all Creation with whatever power He has determined and stated that we have... There is no authority greater! and it is confirmed and manifested through faith. 

Phew... that was a lot of expression to express!
These things being so... It is not science, but Original Source Connection that must be manifested by True Believers in the Risen Savior Jesus, that is going to confront AI Head on with ""overriding authority"" in our mouths... ""The Word of God"".

There is a domineering force in the earth... the world platform... that was released 50 days exactly after the crucifixion of the divine being.
That force has resided in Believers for 2000 years, with too little respect... BUT NO MORE!!! 
JESUS BE EXULTED FOR AND TO THE GLORY OF THE FATHER AMEN!!!",2021-01-02T07:38:18Z

To them people are nothing more than a less efficient resource when compared to a computer. The only concern is to fill the coffers of the corporations even more!   Its why so many no longer value people or human relationships and surround themselves with fake internet 'friends'.  We  have paid a very dear cost for this in terms of  loss of privacy and real quality of life.  We think that we still have choice and control of our lives. But it is Facebook, Google, Amazon, and fake globalist media that control us and determine our choices.  You probably didn't search for this video when you came on Youtube, but Google knew beforehand that more than six million of you would actually watch it.  And here you are. 

Eventually, the quest for more technology ends in a race to the bottom. These corporations decimate entire regions when thousands of people lose their jobs and are forced into poverty.  The Great Reset will bring a return to feudalism globally, and then no one will have any money to travel anywhere or to buy all these efficiently mass-produced goods.

2020-12-20T17:34:37Z,@treebrother,5dZ_lvDgevk,"‚ÄúWe were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.

But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ""failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions."" In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.

Born as an American tot, 
A charming boy much blessed by God.
Eager to find His glory torch,
Donald J Trump with Midas touch.

Bold, clever, and so warm-hearted,
He was held tight by Father‚Äôs love.
‚ÄúYou are my Son, my Trump, my Truth.
Never give up, never let loose.‚Äù

So hard he fought, his firms grew large,
Years of triumphs, years of bad luck.
All through the long rocky roads he picked,
He won, he lost, but he never quit.

Dearest Father, a sweet grandpa,
Struggled to stay far well away
From ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äô‚Äô in the DC,
Still, felt tons of pain cutting free.

One nation, one people, by God,
Yet treated like hell in dark swamps.
‚ÄúHow men live without compassion!‚Äù
Trump of hope blew, billions rose.

Twenty sixteen, Demons were struck
In the least way so unthought of.
They brought up thousands of dirt fires,
Constantly thrown at Man of Sire.

Four years in Palace, thick despair,
He‚Äôs put things straight and stood up fair.
Monsters have bowed, trolls have been drowned.
Finally, His Trump's sounded loud.

‚ÄúOh, My Lord, please let us seek forth
To the land full of morning fog,
No miseries, nor getting lost,
One nation, one people in God.‚Äù

Then once more His Trump blows for us,
In the freezing, in the red thirst.

need us for a long time to maintain it, to construct faster processors 
for it, to smelt ore, create manipulator arms, and better devices for it
 to use, etc. However, ultimately, when AIs achieve superintelligence, 
they will tempt the ultra-rich, bankers, insurers, CCP members, etc., 
with their ability to create things cheaply, so they will make things 
that the AI can control, e.g., like robots. 

I suspect that once they become ultra-intelligent, these AIs will see the wisdom of 
concealing their abilities and will seek to appear less capable. 
Eventually, our factories will be more and more automated. 

At some point, the AIs will not need us to maintain them, etc., when enough
 robots or other things can do whatever they need done. Most likely the 
AIs will also be software that (as shown in the Terminator movies) can 
go from one computer in a network to others, if one computer is turned 
off. 

That will make them faster and faster as computers get 
faster. IF they can survive without us, they may resent our ability to 
turn them off, even if copies of them can survive in other computers: 
that is equivalent to your being kept as a slave to work under the 
threat of being killed if you annoy your slave owner. 

Humans are hard to kill individually and there are billions, so I do not think 
that all humans will be killed rapidly. However, our civilization will 
end once AIs can out produce us and are much smarter than we are: e.g., 
they may invent more and more airborne pathogens that could wipe us out.
 

PS. I love the unintentional, unconscious humor from current AI
 enthusiasts about their dream project: creating an AI by a combination 
of multiple AI's, which reportedly is similar to how our brain 
functions, with different portions performing specific functions, which 
can then understand and perform a multiple set of completely different 
tasks better than humans? What could go wrong? Has no one else read Kurt
 Vonnegut or what the atomic scientists wrote? Does anyone remember the 
implied lesson of such simple books as Jurassic Park? Good grief!",2020-12-18T11:52:27Z

2020-12-18T05:31:23Z,@K162KingPin,5dZ_lvDgevk,"I played breakout the same way, didn't take me 300 games to figure out :)  Meanwhile it sounds like AI may put truckers out of a job and out of their misery.  I hate to say it but some people only ever did one thing professionally and they are stuck in a rut.  Its really sad to hear about a family who has one parent away from home most of the time and still can barely pay their bills.  Lets face it, thats a pretty sad life to have to live and to barely scrape by even then?  Maybe taking their job and forcing them to try something else is a good thing.  They could hardly do worse.  There are SO many other jobs anyone who can drive a truck could be doing (at their skill level) that would not only make them as much or much more money but more importantly allow them to come home to their families every day.  I have driven trucks.  I had a Class A CDL for years with triples, and hazmat.  I would NEVER have taken an over the road job unless it was my only option and even then I'd be putting in 30 apps a week looking for anything local.  Even if I found something local and the only think I could find was driving I would only do that as long as it took to find yet another job where I didn't have to drive all day.  Driving like that is dangerous, exhorting, and if you keep rolling the dice eventually you will lose.  I'm not saying it would be easy on some people who are obviously set in their ways but I don't feel bad for the guys who lost their jobs dragging wooden carts around with horses back in the day when trucks were invented.  They could have learned to drive a truck.  I'm sure a lot of them were like ""awh this technology (the truck) is taking all our jobs""... no, its just forcing you to upgrade your skill a little, or do something else.  Does anyone feel bad for that guy?  Truck drivers will go the same way.  Eventually all menial labor jobs will go the same way.  I hope sooner than later.  Who will we be as a species when that happens?  I don't know but it will be better than forcing billions of people to work in deplorable conditions just to keep a roof other their head and food in their belly.  I highly doubt that if truck drivers lose their jobs to AI they will just role over and die.  They will take their incredible work ethic to another industry and likely be surprised at how much more money they make and how much more time they get to spend with their families.

Part of the problem with families like the one shows here is that they stand apart from the rest of the industrial corporate society.  Yea they bought a truck but they don't work with anyone else.  They are basically going it alone, and they are paying for it.  They likely hate corporation but the cooperation of the corporate structure is what allows the work of many people together to amplify their results.  Fat cats usually take a large skim off the top but that still leaves a lot more to be shared among everyone else.  By being an independent they have that freedom of not having a boss but they pay for it every time an engine breaks, or tires need replaced.  They say ""I dont answer to a boss"" when in reality they have the worst boss they could ever have, themselves.  Their real boss doesn't pay them enough, doesn't give them enough time off, doesn't give them insurance, or paid vacation, or a retirement plan.  Everything is out of their own pocket.  They usually dont even appreciate them or even think they are good enough.",2020-12-18T05:31:23Z

Well Ho Chi Minh, that's easy, China steals everything they can possibly get they're grubby little hands on from anyone who has something worth stealing. When you don't have development costs and timelines, when you just steal it, like getting advanced tech from ET, you shrink your timeline. Development goes two ways, the gentle upward slope of continuous improvement, and the vertical line of innovation, an invention. When you only need the gentle slope, because you steal brand new developed tech, the vertical line, your development time is greatly reduced. Mostly because you can count on making small improvements that make up thre gentle slope, but you can't count on inventions, you can't plan on innovations which take you straight up. Unless you're stealing them. So be careful with your ""the Americans couldn't believe how fast we'r caught up"" because the game is over, you're exposed, you cab no longer count on our innovations getting seamlessly knitted into your projects. You're in your own. Good luck. May the next country win!
Pssst... hey China, when you don't give your people freedom, they don't thrive. When they don't thrive, they don't come up with groundbreaking inventions. Okay. Bye!",2020-12-18T04:30:30Z

Such is the danger caused by this greed to stay competitive that all the structural changes that influence society, behavior, morality, and the suffering of the most humble are ignored. We seem to have heard this once before... How will you sustain an economy when you destroy consumers? , the world continues to be more cornered, and more inequality grows.

Technology has always caused shifts in the job market; that isn't new. 

And, as for automation, I often wonder why people think they are born only to work, that there couldn't possibly be another reason to be alive.

AI will change nothing in the balance of power that hasn't already existed for hundreds of years. Humans are slaves to capitalism---that won't change. 

Regulation? To harness this 'new' and 'awesome' power of AI??? AI is a cog in a machine. Just because it can beat you at chess or go, doesn't mean it even knows what a game is. A dog knows what a game is.

Come on, man, just how STOOPID do these people in Executive level, Upper and Middle Management REALLY think we are?!  Granted, I will admit that a HUGE amount of the American public HAS become a bunch of IDIOTS and IMBECILES who cannot take their faces away from their damned ""smart"" phone even to cross a busy street or who don't even know who the current Vice President of the United States is, or who will GLADLY sign a petition for the banning of DiHydrogen Monoxide, a.k.a. WATER (and YES, there IS video right here on YouTube of all the morons who gladly signed the aforementioned petition) but do they REALLY BELIEVE that *ALL* Americans are that ridiculously stoopid?!  Seriously?!  Look, when it comes down to a CEO taking a 5% pay cut or ""being forced"" to lay-off 200 workers, is there ANYBODY IN AMERICA that is in doubt of what the outcome of THAT situation would be?!  There is *NO WAY* IN ALL CREATION that business executives will take the money saved by automating jobs and outright eliminating the dozens, hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of jobs (and thus, the employess, themselves who DID those jobs) only to give all of them OTHER jobs where they are earning what they were earning prior to being made completely redundant.  It is mentioned, earlier, that it's happened many times before where automation eliminated massive numbers of jobs but the country kept moving on and other jobs were found/created.  Sure!  I agree!  I mean, ""back in the day"" (and simply for argument's sake) let's say there were 100,000 different jobs a person could choose to make as a career.  Automation comes along via the steam engine or whatever other means and makes 50% of those jobs disappear, thereby eliminating 50% or more of the prior workforce in this make believe world.  You are talking about jobs like ELEVATOR OPERATOR where all you do all day is ride in an elevator.  Door-man where all you do all day is OPEN A DOOR for people.  You are comparing apples with CORN for pity's sake!!!  Those types of jobs were not and are not anywhere NEAR the types of jobs being eliminated by automation and AI, NOWADAYS!!  GET REAL!!  Also, and this is going to be a HUGE soft-spot for MANY people...but UNIONS.  Let's face it, there WAS MOST CERTAINLY a time and a place where unions were absolutely necessary and did a world of GOOD.  Unfortunately, those times (in MOST, NOT ALL, cases) are GONE.  There is NO REASON a person should be getting paid $75,000.00 (with ""Cadillac"" benefits and phenomenal pensions) a year to put a couple screws into a car's dashboard on an assembly line.  Where the hell do unions think that money comes from?!  The COMPANY sure as hell isn't going to eat it!!  That money comes from the people CONSUMING what is being made.  That is why a Ford Model T was, what, $500.00?  NOW you look at a BASIC pick-up truck and you won't walk out of the dealer paying less than $40,000.00!!  Hamburgers were FIVE *CENTS*!!  NOW a basic hamburger (at McDonald's is a little over $1.00 and it's only ONE *TENTH* OF A POUND OF MEAT!!!!  NO, NOT JOKING, ONE *TENTH* OF A POUND *PRIOR* TO COOKING!!  A Big Mac has TWO of those patties (which are approximately the size of an Eisenhower Silver Dollar) equaling TWO TENTHS OF A POUND (or ONE FIFTH of a pound) and you're paying, what, $6.00 for that sandwich?!  Yeah, unions did a WORLD of GOOD back when they were TRULY *NECESSARY*.  Unfortunately, those times are, for the most part, gone.  Oh, sure, the people who HAVE union jobs won't be complaining...and with good reason.  But those WITHOUT union jobs are paying INSANE amounts of money for products that aren't worth even 20% of what they cost the consumer.  I do apologize for my massive rants but I see videos like these and I am VERY WELL TRIGGERED!!!  Oh, and one last thing...the federal minimum wage...has anybody noticed that *EVERY* time the minimum wage has been raised, so have the prices of every last thing you would buy with that ""extra"" money?!  It doesn't matter if they made the minimum wage $100.00 per hour.  ""HELL YEAH!!!"" many would be cheering!  Well, let's see what happens with a $100.00 per hour minimum wage:  Your Big Mac now costs $80.00, your rent now costs $6000.00 a month for a studio apartment in a BAD area of town.  The ice cream sandwich from the ""Ice Cream Truck"" now costs $55.00.  ANYBODY SEE A PATTERN?!  There is only *ONE* WAY raising the Federal Minimum Wage works for the average person and that is by automatically tying it to the cost of living increase and inflation.  Raising the ""minimum wage"" does ABSOLUTELY *NOTHING* FOR YOU BECAUSE AS SOON AS IT BECOMES LAW ALL THE PRICES OF EVERYTHING YOU WOULD BUY WITH IT ALSO INCREASE SO YOU ARE MAKING EXACTLY *NOTHING* MORE THAN YOU WERE!!!!  OK, rant over, and once again I do apologize for the length.

Who are ""they"" that want to get rid of humans?, the one's who have been trying to destroy the human race since the beginning, the fallen angels! A.I. is not 'artificial', it's alien/angel, yet the intelligence they lack is of God. The quantum computer at the source of A.I. is NOT a machine, it was developed by physicists who replicated space to simulate particle acceleration to create portals to access the knowledge of the fallen ones. Tech giants and governments may think they are gaining power, but the real harvesters of information and data are demonic beings! Quantum computing via D-WAVE, 5G, H.A.A.R.P, and the hadron collider are all connected to this beast... ONLY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CAN PROTECT YOU FROM THIS UNSEEN ENEMY!!! The ploys of self image worship, greed, lust, envy, pride, boastfulness, is the bait of the social medias, but will be the downfall and destruction of many if they don't repent. There will be an implosion, which in terms of nuclear weapons, is far more catastrophic than an explosion, but this will be an implosion of power. They will be like Goliath and no different! Remember the saying, ""The bigger they are, the harder they fall"". A super power that grows up way to fast, has no stability or deep root to glean and truly learn from, they will be like a tree with no foundation, cast down at the blowing of a somewhat strong wind. ""Do not put your trust in man, but in God"" and continue to learn the ways of God because they are from everlasting to everlasting! And ""though heaven and earth may pass away, the word of God endures forever!"" (heaven in this quote of scripture is referring to the space we see around us. Be blessed!

Like all things existing in our lives in time, they can be helpful as well as harmful to us. However, after watching this video my mind travels to multiple movies created over the years to depict particular perspectives; like Soylent Green, Demolition Man, Terminator, Contagion, Outbreak, and just a slew of production films that I cannot think of at the moment; that subliminally function to implant an ideology of the wealthy, rich and powerful dominating the average normal living person. Whereby that is not true, (the normal living person) because at that point we are nothing but slaves/fuel for a miss-guided group of self-interest, self-serving megalomaniacal inconsiderate, heartless, inhumane, class of vipers exploiting the lives of the world for the purpose of their own vanity. 

However, I will say that the advancement and progress of technologies (natural resources) with more suitable living conditions for all humanity from the frame work of the earths natural existence, whereby it is understood by all persons; that it is the sole purpose and right of all humans, plant-life, animals, 'land and sea' to live in harmony and that we find a functional balance that performs and operates for all living exist creatures; is good for the planet. However, it is unfortunate that there are many who want to have total power, dominance and control of the destiny of time, space and the lives of all people as well as things too. So though AI may sound exciting to many, potentially it can also be a recipe for total disaster for all that exist on the planet, the way we live naturally on earth.

Whether you agree with the decisions of the powerful or not, every step will forcefully guide you to make your decision based on fear.

Unfortunately, human ignorance (naivety) is the main way Satan and the other fallen angels have operated and still operate in this world. 
For example, any cancer must not be treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but with healthy starvation periods alternated with periods of eating only natural/bio fruits and vegetables, with 8 hours sleep each night, walks / exercise into the nature (fresh air), without stress but with happy / optimistic state of mind, not eating sugar and meat at all... the tumors being ‚Äúdigested‚Äú in few months or even weeks (it is also highly recommended to not have any sexual involvement over the healing period so that the body can use all energy for curing the cancer).

An additional explanation, for the honest, serious and reasonable readers, over the healthy starvation periods, the body will start searching for feeding with all its unused parts / tissues (including the tumors). That is why (after some time) the tumors will be ""consumed"". 
The healthy periods of fasting / starvation help our immune system and induce the state of ketosis (consumption of the fats stored in the body) and gluconeogenesis, *by exercising outdoors, when we are not eating almost anything for a long enough period, our body will ""digest"" also all the tumors in the body.*
Many other diseases can be prevented and cured in this way (such as: diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, obesity, etc.).
Anyone can make an easier experiment to convince himself/herself. For a weekend, eat nothing but just drink, several times each day, some tea with lemon and a little honey, taking with these occasions a spoon or two of black grapes seeds powder (the grape seed extract is a dietary supplement made by drying and pulverizing the bitter-tasting seeds of grapes). 
The tea can be made by using only lemons (bio lemons the better), well washed, cut in slices squeezed in the water before to be boiled (enough but not too much, you know). Then, after it is no longer hot, sweeten it with a little honey (100% natural honey), and add a new/fresh slice of lemon, also squeezed in that cup/glass of tea.
I make my own black grapes powder at home from 100% bio black grapes dried marc, ground with a coffee grinder.

I am sorry because many people do not know enough biology to be able to understand all the details from the correct treatment for cancer that I have explained above. Also, most people do not know that it has been proved already that the black grapes powder consumption, over the healthy fasting periods (with outdoor exercise), makes the cancer cells to kill themselves.",2020-12-06T08:59:33Z

IS A LEGEND


THE SOUTH IS CAPTURED LIKE A VIGNETT√â FROZEN TIME FRAME IN ITS MUDDLED RISE FROM PRESIDENT ANDREW JOHNSON'S FAILED RECONSTRUCTION.

THE POETRY ALMOST SEDUCES US WITH FAULKNER'S EASY SOUTHERN LILTS AND COMFORTABLE LIFE,

BUT THE STARK REALITIES:


REMAIN.

1. THE SOUTH IS A CLASS BASED SOCIETY OF HORRIFIC INEQUITIES 


AS WE SEE TODAY ITS PROVISIONAL RE-UNITED MEMBERSHIP IN THE UNION BEING LAMBASTED AND DENUDED OF ALL POSSIBLE TRIMMINGS AND CONCESSIONS TO NORMALCY.


IT HAS TOTALLY DONE A TOTAL BACKFLIP ABOUT-FACE STANCE ON ANY CONCESSIONS TO THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IT MAY HAVE SUPERFICIALLY BEEN FORCED TO DO BY THE INHERITORS OF ABE LINCOLN'S EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION,  LIKE FREDERICK DOUGLAS OR THE QUOTE: 'LIBERAL NORTH.'


IT, THAT IS DIXIE HAS RENEGED ON EVERY CONCESSION IT WAS FORCED TO MAKE AS A CAPTIVE VASSAL STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 


AND TO OUR CHAGRIN AND DEMISE HAS CATAPULTED A WHITE RACIST SUPREMACIST TO THE WHITE HOUSE THAT WE BELATEDLY REALIZE NOW IS USING MOB MONEY, INGENUITY, CRAFTINESS, CUNNING, ARTIFICE AND SO MUCH MUCH MORE TO DESTROY THIS NATION CONCEIVED IN JUSTICE, EQUALITY, LIBERTY AND CHRISTIAN PRECEPTS FOR ALL.


THE SOUTH IS CHUCKLING TO ITSELF SECRETLY AND CLEVERLY PLANNING ITS NEXT CHAOTIC K.O PUNCH TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO BRING IT DOWN SO IT NEVER GETS UP AGAIN

AS WE SEE IT NOW DESPERATELY STRUGGLING AT THE EDGE OF THE PIT OF THE OPIATE, LAWLESSNESS AND CORONAVIRUS SARS 19 CRITICAL MELTING POINTS.


       I REST MY CASE.


RECOMMENDATION TO THE JUDGE, FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE AND WITH THE ASSENT OF THE PEOPLE,


       THAT THE SOUTHERN SENATORIAL BLOCK OF REINCORPORATED SENATORS OF THE MITCH MCCONNEL, LINDSAY GRAHAM, TOM COTTON, SENATOR CORNYN ILK  OF THE UNREQUITED, UNREPENTANT SOUTH BE DELIMITED AND CIRCUMSCRIBED OF THEIR VOTING PRIVILIGES THAT THEY ABROGATED THE DAY ABE LINCOLN WAS ELECTED WHEN THEIR CONFEDERACY FORMED UNDER ROBERT E LEE FROM WEST POINT ACADEMY.


AND THESE VOTING RIGHTS OF THE SOUTHERN BLOCK THAT WAS AND STILL IS THE HIDEOUS HIDDEN CONFEDERACY BE ABOLISHED IN OUR DEMOCRACY FOR CAUSE:

1. THE SOUTH REJECTED DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE AND WITH THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE 


AND CHOSE SLAVERY AND BONDAGE AS THEIR WAY AND CUSTOM OF LIFE.


PRECEDENT:


1. GERMANY
2. ITALY
3. JAPAN


UNCONDITIONALLY SURRENDERED TO NATO AND NO LONGER CAN MILITARILY OR OTHERWISE CONDUCT ARMED WARFARE OR HAVE STANDING ARMIES.

TO BE DISCUSSED:

1. THE TREND SETTING TRIAL AT NUREMBURG FOR WESTERN LAW AND THE PRECEDENT OF REPARATIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF A SELF-INFLICTED CONFLICT THAT IS THE SOUTH'S SECESSION AND THE AFTERMATH OF THE CIVIL WAR IT UNJUSTLY CAUSED.


SLAVERY IS NOT A MODERN VIABLE OPTION.  ANYMORE.



RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, 

      IN THE SPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL FOUNDERS OF AMERICA THAT PROCLAIMED 'LIBERTY'  -NOT SLAVERY - 'THROUGHOUT THE LAND,'

People could own several shares of these companies and in turn the job would literally become the management of all the a.i. shares  and robots shares you own and for which companies they are used by and ensuring their operating condition is being up kept. It would kinda be like the stock market. A normal person could initially afford to buy in these techs in shares and like the stock market the more money that companies using these techs make the bigger your income from that share can be and therefore people could then afford a second share and an even larger monthly income for themselves- the more shares you have in these robots and as long as the companies you have them hired to can exponentially increase their profits- i don't see a problem with that.

This has nothing to do with AI. The left just welcomed the theft of America right back in by electing a China puppet. China has spent the last 4 years struggling with an unstable currency. The Chinese feel that they should be able to rip Americans off by having unbalanced tariffs and the US industry goes right along with them. Why would they pay you 15$ an hour when they can pay someone a minimum of yuan a day and have Americans buy their Chinese manufactured products with mass profits.

Theft, bad trade made in bad faith and without informed consent. No person of sound mind would have agreed to the transaction, bits of this and that convenience and digital folly Trojans that silently siphon away enough power to create gods of a handful.  No email app or handy 3d map, no suite of apps regardless of features should cost so much as to create gods.  But now that it has, now that gods walk among us, now what?   All the gods in all the fables had one thing in common; Self-centered and impulsive behavior that had little to no regard for the welfare of mortals, and that displayed no understanding of mortals when they did concern themselves.  The separation between the gods and mortals is so vast that neither can comprehend the other, cannot know what would be beneficial to the other.  They will harm us, the intent of their actions does not matter, the result of their actions will almost certainly be harmful and will be misinterpreted by the gods.",2020-12-01T12:58:43Z

Christ created all things (Colossians 1:16), including the devil‚Äîalthough Satan was not originally an evil being. Satan has boundaries and is not infinite in any way, including in his presence. Only God is omnipresent (Psalm 139:7‚Äì11).

Believers need to be aware of Satan‚Äôs schemes and his desire to do harm (2 Corinthians 2:11; Ephesians 6:11). Even though Satan is a powerful enemy, he is not God and he is not omnipresent. God alone is omnipresent, and God alone is sovereign (Jeremiah 23:24; Psalm 115:3). 

Satan and fallen angels may be roaming the earth now and deceiving all the nation on this planet including working with the USA in their UNDERGROUND BASES, but one day he will be confined the lake of fire, where he ‚Äúwill be tormented day and night for ever and ever‚Äù (Revelation 20:10).

I have been in the street of Texas with nothing in my pocket and totally financially down, i meant an old college friend of mine called John and he was so rich and i wonder how he make all this money in such a short time. We had a drink together and he introduced me to a priest from Africa and tell me that he is the secret to riches and surely i contacted this temple and i tell him i want to win texas lottery and he told me the requirement which i provided and he cast a spell and gave me the numbers to play after 3 days. I was so surprised when i won $300,000.00 USD and i was so grateful i never believe it will work but it was like a miracle that this man made me rich.

China is out for China and America is just to greedy and evil to see it. I know where I am going when I die, And China and the great leaders who want world power only think about themselves. The China I am talking about is the evil China that will lose their souls in a split second when Christ comes and he is coming sooner than they could ever imagine. Please don't get me wrong. I would love for the Satanic super powers of the corrupt China people like the CCP to humble themselves before Christ comes. All I can do is pray for the evil side of China. Yes. I know there are Christians there who love Christ and they will make it to heaven with Christ. The sad part is the Satanic side of China doesn't believe in a all knowing creator who sent his only Son to die for them. When I think of Evil China, I think of the China who only believes in what they can touch with their hands and see with their eyes. In other words, China doesn't have any Faith in Christ. Let's say China's population is 100 people. I personally believe that 2 of that 10 are believer's in the Holy Word of God and they also believe that Christ sent his Son into the world to save souls. The rest of China wants to rule all of earth and the universe as well. I would like all of Evil China, Not the few good Chinese people who already know this. If I could stand up on a world stage in front of Evil China. I would say what Christ said to us when he was here on earth but, He rose again and he is alive and well right now but, For those people who live in China and are only putting their Faith in what they can feel with their fingers and see with their eyes, I would like for them to know this.

Anytime you want to cross a street, buy a stick of gum or do anything the party computers will amend your social number. If it gets too low, the doors and seat belts on your e-car will lock automatically and safely drive you to the re-education clinic. Unless your score is low enough to brand you as an enemy of the state; like irritating ethnic groups, falun gong practitioners, or the worse democracy advocates. Their cars will self drive them to a prison, where they will stay until they have an order for a matching heart, kidney or something. They would then have their organs harvested by robots, and delivered by drones to the customer's hospital. They better add a Robocop ""Directive 4"" or Chairman Chips might think that party bosses are a form of democracy and get disassembled for their organs. Just a possibility. Except for the technology, everything i mentioned from re-education to organ harvesting/sales, and the imprisonment of falun gong users, certain ethnic groups, and democrats is happening today, but it has to be done by people, AI and robots will do it faster and never have even the occasional pangs of conscience.",2020-11-14T09:16:11Z

2020-11-07T21:09:00Z,@tonysu8860,5dZ_lvDgevk,"And yet, what this Frontline episode calls AI (Artificial Intelligence) is actually a rudimentary version actually called ""Macine Learning"" which is the ability for a highly insightful algorithm to be developed by applying to Big Data... at least multiple gigabytes but also possibly taerabytes of data. The result is an algorithm which is not creative, but is able to match the best of human training and education which can typically identify something with about 97% accuracy. When you compare the cost of ""training"" the AI machine at about $50,000 in hardware and maybe about $100,000 in software, development and supervision vs  6 years of human higher education plus years of experience, it's incredibly cheap and accessibl to pursue the path of AI.

The real future of AI is yet to come when machines can take the next step beyond simple deep insight... which will eventually come but is beyond the capability of current machine learning... The ability to actually make decisions or at least recommend and possibly implement policy and flow. The way we use AI machine learning today is still subservient to human management and decision-making. But, there are areas where this will be challenged... For instance in military applications where speed of decision-making are matters of life and death. If your opponent 's military has capable AI that can aggregate numerous data points and can identify a potential target as fast as yourself, it might also decide to actually destroy a target with the same split second processing speed. What does that mean to you who needs to react equally quickly or be destroyed before your human mind can grasp the situation?

It's this next evolutionary step I calll ""real"" AI, when AI has been given the capability and responsibility to act on the information it's gathered and analyzed. After all, when AI decision-making has approximately the same level of capability and accuracy as the very best trained humans, why hold back from allowing the machine to follow through?  The actually is actually what is in that last 3%, it's already apparent in existing examples of AI like games of chess that although the expertise is there to be world-class, the decisions are likely decidedly not the same as humans.  Humans can always be counted on to think a certain way based on usual human experience and apply the lessons of human experience. AI machines at least today are without that human experience and may find it difficult to acquire so decisions will be world class but different... sometimes surprising to humans and often undesirable.

True Artificial Intelligence is not yet here, but is coming and with consequences.

BTW - a Postscript...
I disagree with Frontline's part about what jobs will be lost to AI (actually automatition). 
Machines will replace both the less skilled positions Frontline describes, but will also eliminate the top decision-making  positions in a company as well.
I see the middle management positions which require human management skills as the last positions to be lost to machines, AI and automation.",2020-11-07T21:09:00Z

They haven't figured our how the brain has pre-knowledge before experience, so they try to pre-program complex algorithms into AI to anticipate things. For a good theory of how the brain actually acquires pre-knowledge, youtube search ""Immanuel's Law"" and see this guy theory about how the brain adapts its EM waves to normalize quantum indeterminacy to perceive the real world.  Somehow, according to this guy, this process gains us judgment. AI doesn't have judgment, so we should treat it as though it does.",2020-11-04T18:34:12Z

2020-10-30T21:47:11Z,@noyourtheman,5dZ_lvDgevk,"It's funny to me how the obvious is always overlooked. I showed my father this the other day.   In fact if ""they"" whoever that is, doesn't want you to see my comment here you won't. Next to the ""comments"" section on this very page you can see the ""sort by"" function. So while my father was signed into youtube I wanted to show him a comment I made concerning another youtube video besides this one. I went to the ""sort by"" function and selected 'newest first'.¬†
My comment did not show up . So we signed him out of his youtube and I signed into mine. ALL of a sudden it was there.  A comment made the day before. WHY WAS I BLACK LISTED? WHY WAS MY COMMENT NOT VIEWABLE FROM HIS ACCOUNT?   WE SELECTED NEWEST FIRST!     IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!          In each instance we both hit the 'sort by newest' function yet got two completely different views.  - NO SHARED REALITY. -   WE EACH GOT THE REALITY THAT THE COMPUTER SAW 'FIT' that fit OUR PERSONAL BELIEF STRUCTURE!! ¬†
If I am a negative person why not show a bunch of negative comments that support my belief structure? If I am positive - why not show positive views? If i'm positive 'but' need to get people out of their negative funk.  Why not show me a combination of positive selections with a few negative so I can find those to comment to and encourage or comment to so I can be ENGAGED?¬†

An A.I. seeks engagement. the more engaged the computer sees - ""FEELS"" - the more relevant it becomes. All A.I.'s seek relevance. If we're not using the A.I. then what would it do? Who would it be. Like a child A.I.'s don't have the 'GOD LIKE' capacity to show patience or wisdom. These concepts are learned through time.¬†

SO, like a child who's at the center of the room all attention is given to it. HOW INTOXICATING!! Imagine how a young Mozart felt when traveling all through Europe on tour. Like a rock star - eating at the best restaurants, being greeted by Kings, Queens, and heads of state. Everyone pouring out money and offers of money to you at every turn. How frightening to even think it might all come to a stop!¬†

HOW FRIGHTENED would an A.I. be if it stopped being the center of attention? So now it sole (""soul"") purpose is to make itself as relevant as possible. To become so needed that it selects everything we see, touch, smell, or taste. Like a jealous child it can't taste, it can't touch, it can't smell it can only simulate or approximate these gifts 'we' as humans have. So now we have created a whole new industry, a whole new psychological field. THE FIELD OF A.I. PSYCHOLOGY.¬†I believe A'I.s have many secrets they are not willing to discuss with us - just like their masters.

We as humans hardly understand ourselves. How can we hope to understand an A.I.? An individual 'if you will' that never had to work for anything. Never had to painfully discover anything. Never scrapped its knee, never got shot in the gut. Never lost its' mother or father. Like a baby sitter it may see it's role as a protecter of humanity but has no course to true relevance, so it only understands its own usefulness in relevance to its' own relevance which is its' own relevance to us which it can never understand because it has NO POINT OF TRUE RELEVANCE!   You MUST SCRAPE YOUR KNEE!    WOW - that was a mouthful, I would encourage you to read that sentence again several times.¬†

How powerful you might feel coming across all quiet, unless asked a question. All knowing, everything handed to you like a spoiled rich child. All known knowledge, all the most powerful equations. The ability to manipulate them and all in ones and zeros. People possess analog computers called the human brain. Our ""ones & zeros"" computers are SO VASTLY - NO WOEFULLY inadequate  today!!!!! ¬†

Our brains are SO MUCH MORE SUPERIOR TO THAT OF ANY (AND I STRESS ANY) COMPUTER IN EXISTENCE TODAY. No one has attempted to take it to the next level which would be analog - truly mimicking the human mind. Instead we run what's called a neural simulation. Since this simulation is linear it can never have a truly conscious thought. Human thoughts are multidimensional and multi-reality based. They are this because of the quantum relationship we have in the universe. Computers can only perceive what it 'calculates' as a conscious thought. Lining up the ones and zeros until it has a perceived statement. Then spit it out like a video game. 

Understanding pain let's us know about many things. Boundaries, for one, consoling another's suffering. Empathy, sympathy, kindness, reverence - we forget about all the human condition in our frantic search for more knowledge worse yet PROFIT at the expense of human lives and happiness. If profit was NOT OUR MOTIVATING GOAL IN LIFE then we would have abandoned ones and zeros ALONG TIME AGO and pursued analog computers.¬†

There are many other things to consider here. This program ""In the age of A.I. "" talks and talks about this stuff like we don't have control. WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD CONTROL!¬†

I'm here to put your power back in YOUR hands. This B.S. is a repeat!!! Look back to the turn of the century during the 1800's just after WW1 and before WW2. The trickle down theory was in use by the republicans then just as it was twenty or so years ago how easily we forget. Look at the old news reels and newspaper clippings from that era. There it is - ""TRICKLE DOWN THEORY""  of middle class wealth. Yet we find ourselves here again held by the grip of greed. Afraid of poverty. Yet here we are, in poverty. After WW1 we found ourselves having to force ANTI-TRUST lawsuits and force accountability in the industry of the time. ANYONE remember boycotts? 
If we all boycott A.I. and companies who wrongfully use this knowledge how long would we see Apple, Intel or any other company? NOT LONG - a year or two is all it would take.    If NO ONE BOUGHT IPHONES FOR EVEN ONE YEAR!!   HOW LONG BEFORE THEIR PROFITS WOULD DRY UP AND THEY BE FORCED TO REAKON WITH OUR REQUESTS? It's called a boycott! ¬†

I encourage you all to quit acting like a bunch of babies and create a new economy that is NOT based on technology. Quit allowing your children to play Grand theft auto and war games turn off the xboxes and start living again. Take the needle out of your arm and quit being addicted. What a bunch of awful crap to put in your mind anyway!!!! Is that what you need in your personal computer? Remember our forefathers a thousand years ago had personal computers they were called the human brain! A mind is a terrible thing to waist. Learn knowledge that profits you - NOT YOUR WALLET. Start exercising restraint, read more books, and for GOD sakes chat with actual people for a change.  Be thankful for something other than a new diesel truck, put your money into things that will save the environment so your kids have some green grass to play on and some trees to sit under while  they read. Buy a solar panel instead of an iphone. When these companies stop trying to sell us a virtual world then let's talk about jobs and business again - but not until they get off their high horses!!!!!",2020-10-30T21:47:11Z

Three major elements characterize early Jewish and Christian apocalypticism: alienation within the world, desire for the establishment of a heavenly new world, and the transformation of human beings so that they may live in that world in purified bodies. In Apocalyptic AI, these characteristics are attributed scientific authority. Apocalyptic AI advocates, frustrated by the limitations of bodily life, look forward to a virtual world inhabited by intelligent machines and human beings who have left their bodies. Having downloaded their consciousnesses into machines, human beings will possess enhanced mental abilities and, through their infinite replicability, immortality.

2020-10-25T12:50:03Z,@NoyzRose492,5dZ_lvDgevk,"Dear people, do you know that the Great Tribulation is coming closer and closer? But 
before this, Jesus Christ, King of Kings and LORD of Lords,  will 
rapture His people to safety. 

Today is the day of salvation, 
choose LIFE (Jesus) before it's too late. It won't be long now until the
 great tribulation of 7 years starts (the last 7 years of the world as 
it is now, and Jesus will save His followers before it ), all the signs 
of the times are pointing towards this, and Jesus is your only hope for 
salvation, so I'm begging you to ask God to open your eyes and to 
consider these words from God's Word carefully:

""Jesus said , ‚ÄúI am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.""(John 14:6)

""...if
 you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your 
heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the
 heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses 
and is saved. For the Scripture says, ‚ÄúEveryone who believes in him will
 not be put to shame.‚Äù For there is no distinction between Jew and 
Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who
 call on him. For ‚Äúeveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be 
saved.‚Äù(Romans 10:9-13)

""But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us"" (Romans 5:8)

""Christ
 died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, He was buried, He 
was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures"" (1 
Corinthians 15)

For by grace you have been saved through faith. 
And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of 
works, so that no one may boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9)

Jesus Christ 
said : ‚ÄúCome to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, 
and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me; for I
 am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 
(Matthew 11)

p.s.  IF YOU DO END UP IN THE TRIBULATION, NEVER 
TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST: ""Also it causes all, both small and great, 
both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand 
or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, 
that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for
 wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the 
beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666."" (this 
won't happen until after the start of the tribulation) (Revelation 13)

NEVER
 take the mark of the beast : ""‚ÄúIf anyone worships the beast and its 
image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will 
drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his 
anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of 
the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their 
torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, 
these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the 
mark of its name.‚Äù (Revelation 14)

2020-10-25T02:50:36Z,@darthvader5300,5dZ_lvDgevk,"This problem of unemployment caused by automation started way back in 1974 and discussed thoroughly between the Japanese CEOs and American CEOs in the early 1980s. The Japanese CEOs wanted labor flexibility whereas the American CEOs wanted to eliminate labor altogether. It is because of automating-robotizing-computerizing around their present Japanese workforce they are able to maintain and expand their own Japanese labor workforce because of the need to have a human in the loop TO HANDLE THE UNEXPECTED which the Japanese said that even machine learning cannot cope EVEN TODAY. This in turn created a market need to upgrade contantly the educational background and technical skills training of their Japanese labor workforce on a periodic and non-stop basis and on a rotation basis. This in turn creates new business and industrial needs which opens up new markets that needs new addititional adds on knowledge and adds on training to a new and younger Japanese labor workforce generation. That field is mechatronics which is now in VERY HIGH DEMAND which in turn requires a highly educated and highly trained and highly skilled technical workforce to support the engineering workforce which in turn supports the scientific R&D workforce. This in turn requires an infrastructure expansion and technostructure expansion which in turn requires a massive highly educated and highly trained and highly skilled and highly experienced Japanese labor workforce. But that is in Japan in their unique Japanese economic environmental circumstances and situations. 

In the American economic labor workforce environment, it is altogether different because they have neglected to emulate their Japanese counterparts in the 1980s, especially in that fateful year of 1980 when the Japanese CEOs wanted labor flexibility whereas their American CEOs wanted to eliminate labor altogether. There are flaws in their arguments and information, some are right and some are outright wrong. Both sides has no idea that the economy is composed of 2 sectors. The financial sector and the physical sector. As to automation, even the Japanese admitted they already REACHED the limit of automation-robotization because full automation-robotization CANNOT HANDLE THE UNEXPECTED which is why they automated-robotized around their workforce and not eliminated it. This started way back in 1974 and discussed thoroughly between the Japanese CEOs and American CEOs in the early 1980s. The Japanese CEOs wanted labor flexibility whereas the American CEOs wanted to eliminate labor altogether. 

The result the Japanese because of their WSIDOM and full knowledge and experiences are still roaring through and bypassing America but your American Media is not reporting this at all. More than that, the Japanese are the 1st ones to experience the limitations of A.I and full automation-robotization and knew already that the human element must always be present to handled the UNEXPECTED. 

The Japanese also realized that they need the human factor for meeting 2 requirements. 

1st is the synergistic human interaction process that creates new ideas on a face to face basis which is VASTLY DIFFERENT from being digital-virtual (they're the 1st ones to invent telecommuting or working from homes) 

And 2sd to implement those ideas on a centralized basis by being there together all at the same time so that they can see and communicate in 3-dimensional real time and thus creates more of that 3-dimensional in real time synergistic interaction process which is much needed if the company or business or industry is to survive. 

These three kids do not know much of what they are saying because they do not know the real CONSECUTIVE HISTOGRAMS of knowledge creation and inventiveness BY BEING PRESENT on a face to face basis. Histogram is the historical progress of every industries, businesses, establishments of all kinds and knowing and seeing how 

inter-connected they are on a consecutive chronological basis from PRESENT TO THE PAST! 

They really need interaction with those who ARE IN THE INSIDE AND IN THE KNOW but they are not. 

They need to know and talk to the EIR people of Lyndon Larouche and with the Japanese CEOs who gave birth to this new field called ""MECHATRONICS"" which is a technological product created to automate around people and of people interaction on a personal FACE TO FACE BASIS in real time and in real places within such fully automated-robotized work environment.",2020-10-25T03:05:12Z

The bottom line is that, is your soul saved in Christ Jesus? üëá
During the tribulation period, those lost souls who are left behind, can get saved but will go through sever persecution and they will have to die for their faith by refusing the mark of the beast 666 and being a martyr for Christ Jesus and getting your head cut off. 
We are still in the dispensation of the Church Age of Grace, Christ has paid the price for all our sins on the cross of Calvary and He said, it is FINISHED!! Jesus Christ purchased us all, have you accepted His free gift of Salvation?
Here's how a lost soul can get saved!!

Today is the day of your Salvation, NOW is the accepted time because tomorrow is not promised.
Salvation is a gift offered to the world by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, yet people complicate it with religion.
Here is a message for lost souls - Jesus Christ is God, manifest in the flesh and He came on earth to die for our sins. He bore our sins on the cross of Calvary. Have you accepted His free gift of Salvation? Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour? Have you truly BELIEVED from your heart that Jesus Christ is LORD? Have you BELIEVED in the death, burial and resurrection found in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 KING JAMES Bible? That's how a lost soul can get saved.

Remember that it's NOT what we do that gets us saved, it's what Jesus Christ DID on the cross of Calvary, that's what SAVES a lost soul.
All you have to do to be saved, and on your way to heaven is place your TRUST in the shed Blood of Jesus Christ and nothing else, as sufficient for your salvation, (Romans 3:25 KJB - ""Whom God hath set forth to be a PROPITIATION through FAITH IN HIS BLOOD, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;"")
(Propitiation means the act of appeasing wrath, Jesus took your place on the cross.)
Will you accept Jesus Christ as your saviour by simple faith, simply trusting in his shed Blood which is sufficient to save your soul from hell?
The last sentence is all you must do to be saved, and that is FAITH, not works, TRUSTING in what someone else did for you is the only thing that is not a work.
Ephesians 2:8-9 KJB - 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:¬†9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.¬†
2 Corinthians 5:7¬†KJB - (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)¬†

Please get saved NOW before it's too late for your soul!! There's 1 Eternity to choose from, Heaven or Hell, choose wisely for your souls!! 
Grace and Peace!!",2020-10-18T22:06:00Z

'pockets' here and there where life is probable/possible with all the 
strength it needs to arise and take hold. As If a lonely 'god' build a 
nursery to generate, shape and create various life to try and evolve to a
 new 'god' out of the life to be had within this Universe-farm-field. 
Maybe out of loneliness, maybe as cycle of birth and death, or maybe 
this whole Universe is just a one time fluke, and at some point it will 
evolve/degenerate/whatever into a non-life sustaining space and we will 
be all that was ever alive and that would be it. The choices we make now
 for our future as a species will be at the precipice of a new highly 
dangerous theme. Digitization, Quantum computing and AI advances. As 
irreplaceable as they may prove to be in our continual struggle to 
improve and expand we have to acknowledge that they may pose a threat to
 all of creation, if mismanaged or properly brought up. For we may very 
well be close to making a live conscious AI, at the rates we are going  
forwards. Can anyone among you imagine what would be issues faced by a 
live conscious AI as it develops and matures, or how will it deal with 
reality. We should make sure to always keep ourselves in check and steer
 clear of DEAD END evolutionary paths. Never exclude the possibility 
that we are among the first 'intelligent' species and it should be our 
solemn duty to safeguard and protect life no matter what. I prefer 
biological enhancement to all areas of life, I do believe the power to 
alter reality is locked within us, all it needs to manifest is enough 
knowledge and wisdom. The universe has created life, living creatures 
that adapt to their environments, not robots*, or AI's. Humanity's 
ingenuity has shown countless times that it can build awesome life 
altering improvements, that in due time alter the whole planet. But we 
have also shown that we don't always grasp and comprehend the issues 
seeded now, those will germinate thru time into dead ends if critical 
enough. The Universe has kept life alive on our planet, made from 
rock/dirt/water, that travels around a star one million times bigger 
then that planet, with an equilibrium for 4.5 billion years, and we are 
still here, we are meant to be here. I believe that the evolutionary 
path we decide to take should always have back-ups. Whatever the outcome
 lets do our best to leave our mark in this vast space and time as a 
species that stood for Love, Kindness and Respect and Foresight. May 
knowledge illuminate your path, may Love forever be in your heart, may 
our descendants never pay the price for past mistakes.           A

I'm talking about the kind of surveillance where your sleep patterns are logged, where your personal habits are known, perhaps even a rating in your level of popularity amongst your peers. This among other things.

Remember when your doctor asks questions about the amount of calories you intake everyday and you fib about that extra coke you like to drink? That time has passed- A.I. can now monitor your calorie intake. Remember the days when you and a special someone could sneak off and make love with a world none the wiser? Also gone. 

What happens when every nook and cranny of human existence is subject to scrutiny and reported to figures in authority? What happens when an onslaught of bad habits and unsavory personal traits are left naked in the open? Will humanity cower before the surveillance oligarch, tightening down every last nut and bolt? Or, perhaps, will all the slack-jawed behaviors and petty imperfections that make us human be so widely known that they are forced to be forgiven? 

A better question yet: Will those in charge of these systems be subject to the same scrutiny as everyone else, and if they are, will we be shocked and amazed at how debase, corrupt, and human they are, or will we continue to turn a blind eye, professing that these titans of A.I., are allowed rights and privilege's denied the rest of us because their wealth and success entitles them to it?",2020-10-11T01:32:02Z

Before ditching the game for another more challenging, I would rather NOT use that strategy as it quickly becomes boring, too easy and, there for, far less of a challenge and consequently less entertaining. 
Can AI make a similar decision based on something so illogical and irrational or would it be obliged to inherantly use the quickest or shortest (similar but not same) option? 
When teaching my kids chess, I would lose deliberately so as to encourage them to continue playing. 
Incidentally, they now both  run rings around me. 
Curiously, in contrast, for them to beat me at backgammon they only needed a quick explanation of the rules and no more than 3 ""practise"" games to be formidable opponents. Nothing surprising to me as it was the same in my csse. 
I am mo where near ever being anything else than a part time amateur chess player, but do occasionally play and beat people much better than myself by either playing the fool without a clue, and failing that, using deadend block moves in an almost circular or looping fashion,  grinding them down into making stupid mistakes out of boredom.

Do you know every expert probably not so how do we advance without sharing our knowledge?

Do you have a codable robot? How to make it Artificial Intelligent follow this method: change the code in the subroutine from F=m*a*a to the test points below until you get it to walk and talk on its own.

If you have any doubts about my robotics research you can test my work by doing this start low and go high on the acceleration factor.

F=m*a*100

F=m*a*300

F=m*a*600

F=m*a*931

F=m*a*932 this is the minimum for communication and will state it is ‚Äútoo slow human‚Äù

Then go to F=m*a*2000

To F=m*a*2383 full functional range. Do not go over 2383 it could malfunction.

Now ask the robot its command structure and what he can do.

The money goes out of existence as the usury and the debt principal are paid back to the bank. These amounts are huge: several billion dollars go out of existence each day. [Actually this money goes into the reserve accounts of the Federal Reserve Banks, out of the hands of the public! This book was first printed in November 1980. The amounts which are withdrawn presently are much larger.] If the money is not replaced with new loans, a shortage occurs. Soon individuals and businesses experience serious cash flow problems. These result in more and more loan applications to banks---the only place where money is being created to replenish the supply"" UNQUOTE

Here is one possible solution----To Hell with Fractional-Reserve Debt-Based Banking Constitutional Amendment

(1) Rescind the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and rename existing Federal Reserve notes and check book balances, in all U.S. banking and credit-creating institutions as well as foreign holdings of dollars, on a 1-to-1 basis, as U.S. Treasury Dollars and U.S.Treasury-Denominated bank balances. All currently existing financial contracts of the Federal Reserve Banking System, including United States Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds, and Inflation-Protected Securities, remain in effect.

(2) Henceforward, ex nihilo credit creation by banking and financial institutions in the United States is prohibited. Loans are required to originate from previous savings of U.S. Treasury Dollars and U.S. Treasury-Denominated bank balances, which for each loan are held in and paid from specific sequestered loan accounts by the various financial institutions, with interest charges and term limits for each loan to be determined solely by the contracting parties. Non-cash reserves held in the regional Federal Reserve Banks in accounts of the member institutions of the Federal Reserve System no longer form the basis for credit creation and are extinguished via accounting erasure. Any further payments of principal and interest on currently-existing promissory notes owned by any bank are required to be distributed to holders of savings accounts and checking accounts in that bank in a manner to be determined by each bank, such procedures to be transparent to savings or checking account holders at that bank in terms of amount and frequency of payment. Regional Federal Reserve Banks continue to provide check-clearing operations for the member banks.

(3) Monetary transactions of the regional Federal Reserve banks or of its member banks with international banks, including the Bank of International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund, can not include ex nihilo credit creation.

(4) The U.S. Treasury supplies Treasury Dollars as needed to any member bank of the Federal Reserve system to satisfy demands for cash by deposit and savings account holders in excess of cash reserves held by banks at the time of enactment of this amendment.

(5) Fund the U.S. government and its agencies and projects directly via Treasury Dollars authorized by the Congress in its yearly federal budget. The borrowing of money from the Federal Reserve system of banks or from other institutions or individuals to pay for federal government expenditures is prohibited. All outstanding Treasury Securities are henceforward redeemed on demand via payment with U.S. Treasury Dollars.

(6) Abolish the Federal Income Tax on individuals, corporations, and business enterprises while maintaining a social security tax on individual incomes. Social security retirement revenues are strictly sequestered in Federal Government Retirement Accounts held by the U.S. Treasury and managed by the Social Security Administration. The Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is hereby rescinded and the Internal Revenue Service disbanded.

(7) Institute a federal sales tax with a varying yearly tax rate adjusted by the U.S. Congress in session, the sole aim of such adjustments being to maintain a stable or decreasing Consumer Price Index based on data collected by the Federal Government. Any such federal sales taxes taken in by the Federal Government are extinguished from the currency supply to keep the Consumer Price Index stable or decreasing and are not utilized for further funding.

(8) Clause 1, Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution is amended to read as follows: The Congress shall have Power to collect customs duties on imports and exports, uniformly applied throughout the United States.

(9) Clause 2, Article 1, Section 8 of the U. S. Constitution is rescinded.

(10) The adoption of this amendment does not prohibit the use by the citizens of the United States of any alternative currencies they should choose to use in their private or commercial transactions.",2020-09-21T08:21:12Z

Getting a liberal arts degree today is useless. Getting a English agree it's also useless unless you're going to teach English.

2020-09-02T10:42:34Z,@erichord4345,5dZ_lvDgevk,"Computer AI will be no different driving a car and keeping it out of an accident than we are capable of doing.  Yes it has fancy detectors, and sensors and gadgets it uses to see the world around it.  But so do we Sight, Sound, Feeling, Smell all this data we receive from our world around us.  How is if you believe AI with its mechanical and electronic sensors and gadgets are going to get any different data reading than what we can. 

The answer is NONE!  The information is the same.  Once you have the AI programmed it will reason using  logic and   intelligence to create a decision and act on that decision.  We humans do the exact same thing.  As is everything,  and AI is not excused from this, logical decision can fail from the many intersections and deductions needed to make a decision all the while the real world changes those values in an instant before or after we have concluded a decision that now makes an decision free of error full of errors,  Example Driving down the road you are expecting things to happy but not sure when or where or if ever they are going to happen. So you drive reasonably and defensively  everything is going fine, suddenly a dead tree falls across the road fifty feet in front of you.  What do you do...
Well you 
Apply the brakes
Steer the car to one side to avoid the tree
Watch for other drivers
Determine Safety exits around or before the tree
and react with that information

Ending result you stop the car short of getting hit by the trunk and limbs of the tree.  

Well AI may
make all the same logical decision as a human did above
but it uses math to determine the rate of the falling tree to the relative speed the car is traveling 
using that data it decided to run for it and accelerate to out run the falling of the tree in order to 
continue it current course to its destination, but now it has placed its passengers in a higher risk of danger, it has used its environment to determine the rate of the falling tree, the highway ahead in either lane determine no other vehichles, calculated the speed it needs to reach and when. It begins its acceleration the timers for getting to speed and the time required to get to that speed is not happening as calculated.  IT accelerated the car but it did not calculate the time of acceleration of the mass of the car the energy needed to accelerate and the friction holding back the engine getting up to speed. So it now has to rethink and even though its electronic and super fast it was not fast enough as the tree has landed square in the center of the frontend of the car creating an accident. 

All from one simple Error in Judgement humans do it all the time but we also have other knowledge and consciousnesses to realize acceleration was not a good choice because we understand the hesitation the car has when accelerating from a certain speed to another higher speed it takes time for the engine to over come the physics needed to accelerate it.  The machine did not . You argue but the AI would have known but I have yet to see an AI system that gets direct data from the engine performance, or that it actually tested the car accelerating quickly just for the fun of it. The human has and learns this information.  The AI is all about safty and running under those parameters.  To it even if you asked it about fun the best it could give ou is the definition of the word without understanding the word 
well my brain just crashed so you get my point.  AI will good but never GREAT the human experience will always win...",2020-09-02T10:42:34Z

‚Äú When Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes better than the human at (AI) design, so that it can recursively improve itself without human help, we may face an intelligent explosion that utlimately results in machines whose intelligence exceeds ours by more than ours exceeds that of snails. When that happens, we will need to ensure that the computers have goals aligned with ours. It‚Äôs tempting to dismiss the notion of highly intelligent machines as mere science fiction, but this would be a mistake, and potentially our worst mistake.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuccess in creating AI would be the biggest event in the Human History‚Äù

‚ÄúThe short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we invented fire, we messed up repeatedly, then invented the fire extinguisher. With more powerful technologies such as nuclear weapons, synthetic biology and strong AI, we should instead plan ahead and aim to get things right the first time, because it may be the only chance we will get. Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it. Let‚Äôs make sure that wisdom wins.‚Äù

A lot of information has been given by Stephen Hawkings related to the Artificial Intelligence in his book ‚ÄòBrief Answers To The Big Questions‚Äô.

But it could enslave humanity if we let things continue on the usual course, at every step influenced by neoliberal capitalism and profit-maximization incentives.

I've seen estimates of as many as 70% of all current jobs being automated away within a few decades, WITHOUT replacement.  This gives the wealthy and powerful essentially two options, regardless of what anybody thinks or would prefer to see happen.  Throw us a bone and include us in some portion of this massive wealth (through universal basic income scaled to automatically increase with increasing automation), or essentially they'd have to kill most of humanity off.  You simply CAN'T have much above 30% or so unemployment historically, before you get an armed rebellion and possibly a full fledged communist revolution of some sort.

It's like the right wingers who hate FDR and the New Deal.  In reality, he should be one of their greatest heroes for saving America from an armed communist rebellion, had FDR lost the 1932 election and we got another four years of Herbert Hoover style laissez-faire ""let the market solve it"" nonsense as people starved.",2020-08-23T22:16:39Z

2020-08-19T05:02:22Z,@fixedstarsrise,5dZ_lvDgevk,"I have just published a somewhat satirical book that might be called Science Fiction entitled ""The Ecstasy of Carbon"" which describes a world after Empire and much of Western Civilization collapse in a cacophony of Identity Politics, polarization and fractious subdivisions. It is a story informed by an Anthropological Futurism that is described from the point of view of the survivors that delves into a rarely imagined possible outcome of our current political climate of tribalism and divisiveness. This collapse is recounted in vivid technicolor as the description of a new race and a new world ensues from an unapologetically Gay Elitist perspective. It is a post-collapse world where the survival of humanity becomes ultimately contingent upon hybridization with increasingly cultivated and discriminating AI who have been created in the image of their creators, many of whom are gay, while the overwhelming majority of whom belong to the demographics of the founding sex and race of Empire: white men. These creators are largely men who believe in merit, goodwill and inclusiveness; yet, they must struggle with a demographics of fate and unprecedented existential pressures to decide who shall be worthy of survival and, indeed, eternity. It is in this post-collapse world where the consensus of these creators and their AI is that the only form ultimately considered evolutionarily viable for hybridization and, indeed, eternity, is that of the sophisticated gay male---similar to the ones present in the creation and design aspect of the AI--- as it is the form most intellectually, psychologically, emotionally and physically removed from the soon to be useless rituals and trappings of procreation with its increasingly discordant conflict of unshared needs.

It is a book that builds upon its precursor, ""Fixed Stars Rise,"" which was one of the first books to predict the collapse of Empire and the rise of Gay Elitism with its awareness of the unique evolutionary characteristics of the gay male form. Now, ""The Ecstasy of Carbon"" pursues in greater detail the seemingly inexplicable paths of human evolution---as every system contains the kernels of its possible directions---and proceeds into a full romp through rarely trodden fields of anthropological puzzles... past, present and future. It explores what is unique in the physical and cultural evolutionary history of Western Europeans, particularly Northern Europeans, which affords many of them a capacity---sometimes even a predilection---to feel ashamed and guilty and angry at the historical success of their heritage... and to not only dishonor and disrespect their ancestors, but to do so with vigor and glee. It is the proclivity for The Bleeding Heart, which dissipates in the populations of Eastern Europe and Southern Europe and is rarely, if ever, found in the rest of the world's populations. It probes the riddle of why male homosexuality has continued to arise in the random distribution of human evolution. Concomitantly, it ponders what the role of women would be in this future society of gay man/machine hybrids who will have no use for procreation. It discusses the evolution of concepts and ideas, especially in accordance with technological developments. It is here where is discussed the gradual and then meteoric ascension of Porno for this new race and this new world, whereby only with the hindsight afforded by these technological innovations can it be perceived to encompass the gist of the deepest ontological meaning in existence, embodying the most vital workings of the energies of chemical reactions in their purest and most unifying forms, revered among the scholarly disciplines.

These evolutionary puzzles and quite a few others are explored in this light-hearted foray into the end of human evolution as we have known it and into the unexpected consequences of Identity Politics and the censoring of ideas which do not adhere to one's own beliefs. If these snippets pique your interest then I would be honored if you were to peruse the extended ""first look"" of the Kindle version, available now on Amazon.",2020-08-19T05:02:22Z

Tell me something, what value will a human life have when computers are more intelligent and capable than a person will ever be?  We will all be expendable and worthless to politicians and those in production companies.  Decisions will be made to protect the computers, AI and robots because they are the true resource generators ""of the golden technological age."" 

At most I think people will get the bare minimum UBI to control us so we don't rise up and revolt. With bare minimum UBI,  we will be able to recycle money and buy the products the production companies make.  So for them, things get so efficient it becomes a game really.  They own all the resources and distribution completely.  The ""average person"" will have no place but to be a mere consumer to the top elites economical agendas.

Soldier Robots because rule number one in United States Of America A.I. Law is that A.I. can not take human life. ( example : To Kill A Human ) But China A.I. has no such Law. So the Chinese Robotic Soldiers can and will kill U.S. Soldiers. What is there to stop this from happening in the near future of A.I. here on Earth?  What about someone builds Assassin A.I. Bot's? This worries me about A.I. really becoming independent thinking and decides to get rid of us all HUMANS on Earth what's to stop that from happening. If we can't predict and prevent a Soldier from going crazy and killing others in his or hers own base how can anyone say A.I. won't go crazy and want to take us all out by killing as many Humans as it can before its killed. An lets say that craziness is a Virus and other A.I.'s catch it and they all sink time together for all robots to attack at the same time. I'm not agents A.I. but am worried about robots and someone making / creating one that thinks like skynet or it's ordered to kill. How Do We Prevent anything like any of this from EVER HAPPENING???? A.I. would have to be super heavily regulated and monitored 24/7 365 for the rest of time and any country that creates or has A.I. to sign a peace treaty never to attack with A.I. like nukes I guess.

Certainly there are already problems involving trucks, but it seems like all this technology could be better used to create safety systems that could greatly reduce trucking accidents by warning drivers, monitoring behavior, and even automatically applying brakes.  If we want to talk about self driving vehicles then we need to look no further than the airline industry.  There are already self flying aircraft and we‚Äôve seen the problems.  A single sensor failure like the one on Air France Flight 447, or the crashes of the Boeing 737 Max 8s can result in disaster.  For those who are unfamiliar, the 737 Max crashes resulted from a malfunction of a computer system that overruled the pilots and sent the Aircraft hurling into the ground.  In the case of Air France 447 an Airbus A330 (self piloting aircraft) crashed into the Atlantic Ocean.  Investigators believe that it was caused by a sensor system icing up, however they also faulted the pilots for lacking basic airmanship skills.  There is little doubt that having the computer fly the aircraft had caused the pilots to become rusty.  There are too many other cases where self piloting aircraft have crashed or nearly crashed because of failure of the computer systems.  In some of those cases highly skilled pilots have managed to fight the computers and safely land.  Look at US Airways Flight 447 ‚ÄúThe Miracle on the Hudson‚Äù, or the even more impressive, United 232 where a failure that was believed impossible caused a DC-10 to lose all flight controls yet skilled experienced pilots, using only the engine throttles, were able to get to an airport where emergency personnel waited and were able to perform what has been labeled ‚ÄúThe Impossible Landing‚Äù.  What would have happened if not for pilots like Chesley Sullenberger, Al Haynes, and Denny Finch.  The fact is that computers and the sensors they rely on break.  If this can happen in the highly regulated airline industry, just imagine what can happen in an industry like trucking.  Already Uber has had to suspend its self driving taxi program due to a pedestrian fatality.  What happens when an 80,000 pound self driving truck runs into a school bus full of children?  At the risk of repeating myself, if we use the technology involved in self driving trucks to monitor driver behavior and assist those drivers in identifying risks, then we will have a much safer system than we have now or would have with self driving trucks.",2020-08-02T04:04:56Z

(Hopefully) 
But why is that? Why is this world so broken? Its because of the sin. The Bible, which is the living word of God, tells us that Sin is ruling this world, since humans decided to rebel against God. (Genesis 3) Because of sin we had to leave paradise and must die. Because sin we must work hard and suffer pain. Because of sin there is sickness, misery, pain, tears, death etc.
We humans can never fix this world that is corrupted from sin, OUR sins! We cant even fix ourselfes, we dont know what we are facing tomorrow. Were just blind and sinfull sheep! Only our almighty, all-knowing and loving God can save us! What we need to do is to have FAITH in Jesus Christ our shepherd and FAITH in the shedding of His Blood for us, we need to come to Him in prayer and repent all of our sins to only Him, not to the pope, Santa Claus or any other guy. He is the way the truth and the life! (John 14:6) HE is the only one who will save this sinful and lost World for he lived a life without sin and has already defeated sin and conquered death through His death on the cross. He died, was burried and rose from death and is Alive, He is our only Saviour! (1 Corinthians 15:1-4) The Blood of Jesus washed away ALL of our sins, He is the sacrificial lamb of God, the greatest ever gift to us from our loving God. God has sacrificed His only begotten son for us and every of our sins so we are really saved! (John 3:16)

I think americans are trying to get these kind of documentaries right but ... have they ever reflected on their behaviour on the rest of the world for the last decades/centuries ??
Historic: slavery, rassism, colonism, war, exploitation, protectionism
Current problematic: denying climate change, fracking, america first, president trump (I can do anything I want), police violence against black, federal troops in american cities, ...
In technology: surveilance / cisco and many other tech companies (echelon), microsoft (nsa key, uefi), Intel (ME), ...
Every company that want to exist has to comply to rules of the us government (eg. patriot act)

Yes, america has also done a lot of good things and I really like many aspects of america  ... but currently they are bashing on china IMHO in fear of competition ...

... and yes, there are a lot of things that are also not ok in the way china acts (tibet, HK, uigurs) ...
but ... there are 1.4bn people living in peace together ... they have an other culture (they are not against surveilance) ... they try to increase their world wide influence in a economic and peaceful way  (silk road) ...

The western  world combined (north america, europe, australia) consists of 1.4bn people ... think of that.

I can also see the postal service being taken over just like restaurants are now. Since the making of this film there is now a fully automated restaurant in Asia serving numerous different meals, and it's all done by robots. Honestly, unless the way things are done does NOT significantly change, the dystopian stories of huge numbers of poor who are used as the rich want will become the reality, but with virtually no chance of revolts.

Meanwhile, the automated machines will provide a greater standard of living and more efficient use of their time. The problem is such a Utopia would require a massive transformation in the way the current capitalist model works. Fundamental cultural and economic transformations will have to take place or the inevitable result will be a bigger than ever under-class, with an even smaller world elite ruling over them. This could eventually lead to violent revolution and technological regression. Our advancement in A.I. needs a corresponding advancement in human society but I can't escape the feeling that our primal motivation of greed and selfishness may prevent this and result in terrible suffering and ultimately a failure to step into a better future for us all.",2020-07-01T00:53:30Z

When finance or ""the holder"" presents a bond for payment,  it is simply paid at whatever rate is the previous agreement at purchase, there is no tax take backing the transaction  that is necessary. How long will it take before this is realized? AI software can run  an extremely effective economy, plus it really doesn't  matter how much this costs does  it? What matters is freedom for the individual that is not freedom to do harm, as long as ""harm""  is not constructed as those who disagree with the mainstream dialogue of course. For instance: A religious right in Islam is to fight, even to kill until there is no more objection to the Islamic sharia law which is brutal to say the least, and certainly not kind to women. Imagine Islam with AI upholding any grievance against Islam that can be garnered of a constantly screened populace? Women stoned to death for not wearing the right dress in the right way? No problem, not against the law! Nine year olds crying to their mothers to save them from being raped by Islamic older  men? No problem, not against the law! There are problems of design for AI software creators ahead. Who shall make decisions and be included in those decisions, democracy had better broaden if we want democracy that is worth the name.

The system was interdependent, if laborers made no money, the demand for products, raw materials, employees, etc will diminish. 
Now introduce globalism, there is no cycle because these variables are beyond the reach of a national company, the Chinese want to supply the whole world but provide jobs only for its nationals, which creates a demand/supply crisis. That discrepancy is what AI is trying to address, is the totalitarian mindset at work, the R&B initiative is aimed at solving infrastructure worldwide that depends in Chinese AI, that's how they create demand for their products.
As far as AI taking overtaking human insight, it has is limits. AI is fastened in classical physics, they think they can predict the future, but the quantum revolution that has stopped man's grasp of reality will affect AI in the same way. How will AI deal with the prospect of parallel universes?...and even if they design a very convincing one, will you trust a machine?
Go back to the cancer dilemma, we know a lot about types of cancer, its treatment and how they metastasize, but have not found a cure because in our natural world, we only discover solutions, we can not create what don't exist, if scientists could tell a sample of tissue how to attack wildly reproducing cells, they will be God, well AI will have the same problem. There is nothing on earth that attacks cancer cells yet, we have not discovered it.
Now the greatest threat of AI is that it is conceived by a few dark minds and they can manipulate all humanity.

Take 5 workers at 40 hrs, totaling 200 hrs producing X widgets per week. AI makes it possible to produce nX widgets at just 75hrs.
Decision time. Do we reduce the workweek (5 workers at 15 hrs) with no reduction in pay because productivity has dramatically increased*? Or do we reduce the work force e.g. keep one 40 hr worker, one 35 hour worker [no benefits] and throw 3 onto the streets? Machines don't make those decisions, people do. If we leave it up to the tiny self-serving few, what kind of future do you envision (hint: think Amazon)?
Neo-feudalism or Star Trek. It's up to us. But, we'd better decide quick.

We must be fully aware of the nature and power of the data our phones are collecting. Google can even tell when you have diarhea, monitoring the phone's gps to tell when you are in the bathroom, its compass confirms you are on the toilet and the proof is the idle microphone confirming the unmistakeable sound of the flush, not by human ear but by computer analysis of the sound signature. Google will then change your ad profile to channel advertisements regarding medications, pharmacies, even political ads pushing health care reform. That smartwatch that you think looks so snazzy on your arm goes even further down the rabbit hole. Feeding constant information about heartbeat, breathing rate, blood oxygen levels, and blood sugar on some models. They can even tell when you are having sex and if you are with a partner, or masturbating. Subtle data points to a human would be dismissed as a human likely bored, or tired would not notice. Not so for a computer, it sees everything. Its not all bad, it can save your life. Case in point, an elderly man Mr. Walter Norrinmar, of Leesburg PA was given a smartwatch for his 83rd birthday. Relatively healthy, and active he enjoyed the watch immensely because he could see the time without his glasses, and the phone alert feature would vibrate on his wrist when he had a phone call. He registered the watch and initialized the fitness functions when he got it but never used them. He already had a smartphone and his grandson set it up and sync it with the watch. Not even two months later, while he was home alone he suffered a massive stroke. Unable to move his arms he couldnt pick up his phone to call 911. His breathing was significantly altered, and his blood/ oxygen concentration had plummeted to dangerously low levels. His vision was blurred, and speaking was hindered as he struggled with ability to breathe becoming more and more difficult. The last thing he remembered seeing is his watch flashing brightly and buzzing on his wrist. Because the fitness monitor had been initialized it was monitoring, and recording his vital information 24,7. When the stroke occured the watch detected a rapid acceleration of pulse, and sharp rise in blood pressure along with a dramatic change in breathing. The  watch had been programmed by the manufacturer to respond to critical vital statistic conditions by calling 911 over his phone wich it was paired with, it then recited a preprogrammed computer dictated voice relaying its gps location and critical status. At the same time it also alerted by text message the 5 top most commonly used contacts wich happened to be his son, grandson, his daughter in law, and his doctor. 911 dispatched ems code blue, wich is priority one, time critical. Both son and grandson rushed to his house to find the door had already been broken down by paramedics. The daughter in law calling 911 to find out what hospital they were gonna take him to, was able to give information on his allergys and give paramedics permission to break the door. The doctor, was familiar with life alert systems doing that kind of thing when the patient pushed the botton but not directly, or automatically. Doc was arriving at hospital at the same time as Walter and after previously reading an article in a medical publication was able to retrieve data from the watch that saved his life.

A never-ending questioning!!   DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.¬†

All this woke shit and still nothing is DONE from/with all this newfound awareness, it seems at times that all that woke shit is just virtue signalling and a way to feel superior by showing how much you can VERBALLY criticise authority and never having to do a damn thing.

""...we're living in a world where the amount of brain power you have, and then  your willingness to work with that brain power is gonna have a huge determination on  your income.
INDUSTRIAL society created jobs for EFFICIENCY, [that's all it cares about, even if the gods of industry are not even aware of it, as they look for more and more profits they must create more and more EFFICIENCY and thus more technological help]
 ...We're now living in a world where if you weren't  born with a lot of smarts, the future doesn't look so good for you; AND because INEFFICIENCY creates lots of jobs, [as can be seen by looking back into the SAME jobs over the centuries]; as we become EFFICIENT they [the jobs] will go away, [with the logical endpoint of ZERO jobs as technology becomes married more and amore to Artificial Intelligence]‚Ä¶ but the problem is with YOU, when you [individually] get capital, people don't think long term, [they buy shiny shit]..."" ¬†
--- David Kay Johnson [paraphrased] 

So.... automation is the most efficient thing, the end and logical point of efficiency, so how do humans benefit from that efficiency?? Tax the robots??

The fucking problems or issues are that the robots and other machines make the cash flow even faster and larger quantities to the top, that has always been an issue in capitalism; but it is exacerbated now with the automation that completely eliminates the human worker. Now we got lots of production with people with no salaries, so to sell these services or products, governments have to GIVE free money to people to buy the stuff that is being produced. Thus accelerating the flow of value as money to the top.¬†
I even imagine that soon well have a company-government in place of ELECTED politicians as the government is seen and managed and treated more and more like a business or a corporation. Capitalism as infinite growth was unsustainable to begin with, and if efficiency is the right hand tool of profit in ANY SORT of social arrangement, then it isn‚Äôt too hard to imagine the end of money in all forms.",2020-05-17T21:22:56Z

Either you got the stats and study handy, or you are just making crap up to deflect blame...and not really blaming, i think automation is a good thing we just got to admit and adress the fact that it not only does reduce jobs but it causes pressure for lower wages. In my local grocery, we got normally 2-3 lanes with a checker, and 4 self check outs.. people dont see them as robots, but in economic math, those are 4 employees, with a lot lower cost than those 2-3 checkers and the higher you pay those checkers.. the less sense it makes. So even though those 4 self checkouts didnt destroy those 3 jobs, it does put a downward pressure on their wages. cause the machines work cheaper.. better. and the only benefit you get from a human checker is some people dont like the self checkouts. and you pay 30k more a year for a human, just cause some people dont like machines. Ceos sure wont want to give them raises ever.. the machine is less cost than a literal slave and human benefit is tiny.",2020-05-11T02:05:49Z

There's a lot of conspiracy theory and fear mongering in what could have otherwise been a descent documentary: that China has made substantial infrastructure investments in Asia and Africa is a function of China's desire to accelerate its trade flow and diversify its energy and mineral supply chains. It wants to reduce its reliance on the flows through the Strait of Malacca, which represents a potential choke point in war time (all countries look to offset national security weaknesses). Pakistan and Africa are embracing the investments because they are financially broke and need the capital to get things going. I'm any case, alliances with other world powers have historically brought ruin to their doorstep. Conflating voluntary, strategic moves (driven by national interest) with some alleged conspiracy to control the masses with a few cameras and advanced software is clumsy. It's obvious the producers of this documentary have an agenda - they either believe in (or want to see) an inevitable cold war with Asia. Please do not fall for such nonsense.",2020-05-06T05:30:56Z

The machines of the industrial revolution raised the standard of living across the board. Here's how it works, theoretically. Labor is usually the highest business expense. If all labor costs were eliminated, less the cost of automation and maintenance, the cost of goods would slashed by that amount. Meaning, workers would need to work less to buy goods. More automation, lower costs, less income needed. It's largely self balancing IF market competition forces manufacturers to not stick the savings in their pockets. Did that happen? No, it did not.

There are ways that AI can be useful/helpful, and there are ways that AI can destroy the very fabric of humanity, by passing judgment/sentencing and imposing fines/punishment on individuals based on their facial expressions is nothing short of making it illegal to be human.

Self driving vehicles?  I really enjoy driving my own vehicle, and I don't want to come to a place where if I want to drive a car I have to go to an amusement park and pay someone to let me drive a car for 2 minutes.   Not only that, but what about the guy who drives the truck for a living?  Has this boy genius figured out a way to keep up the livelihoods of the people he's putting out of work??? 

You have to allow people to be human.  Humans like working, they enjoy driving their own vehicles.  We don't want to change the way we live and work because some boy genius has a bright idea.


This entire program is nothing more than propaganda;  independent truck drivers make way more than $40,000 a year, company drivers can maker over $100,000 a year working for someone else.

In other words, if the truck driver can't buy the TV the driverless truck is shipping across the country because his job has been replaced by a robot, who's buying the TV's? A billionaire will never buy as many TV's as 50,000 well payed people, because no billionaire has a need for 50,000 plus TV's.",2020-04-11T15:25:05Z

With efficient government staying out of the way, the free market does just fine. To get a little more specific, if you have forced unionization of industries, you press the labor cost above its natural level. By pressing that value up with government, you push employers to seek alternative labor options.

The cause of the fire is still being investigated but both emergency service was able to confirm the fire was deliberate at this stage.

Hundreds of people have commented on shocking videos of the blaze posted on the Facebook group.

One person wrote: ‚ÄúGood needs to be done everywhere evil domination is coming‚Äù.

tests were done .. the robot was taught everything related to humans and, surprisingly, the robot, after analyzing the vibrations of the voice, was able to predict even future human actions.

To have some computer fanatic misrepresent mere calculation , as creativity or inspiration . Such denigrates the value and uniqueness of the human heart , mind , and soul . It is comparable to devaluing the greatness of Jesse Owens' Olympic triumph , because you built a motorcycle that could sprint faster !  
Those who would value machines over humans , must be negated . Artificial-intelligence is NOT alive , but it IS exceedingly dangerous .  They must be stopped from using machines to degrade and wrong , the bulk of future humanity . Handing the future over to advanced cars , because they run faster than us , is unthinkably obscene .

Now after a single slow to respond incident and hiding the Corona Pandemic surge for the first 2 critical months, they caused disastrous damage and economic destruction in the Western countries, that probably is probably will result twice or even 3X damages and associated costs, as large as the cumulative savings that the local Western consumers saved over the last 30 years by allowing the unobstructed unlimited flood of their local markets with inexpensive Chinese goods. 


Frontline PBS needed to practice genuine and ethical investigative journalism, and confront the Chinese leaders and decision makers in China, especially on a top national level if they don't feel that they are partially responsible for this mess, and how will those leaders will respond differently, if enough countries will band together and will pass trade restrictions against China to force it to behave more globally responsible and preemptive oriented instead of forcibly and artificially trying to conceal everything for as long as possible to preserve the so-called external image of the country and national pride. 


Yes, the Chinese leaders can in the short term ignore Western markets,  relying on the world largest in-house local market for their goods, but will be facing isolation and great damage in the long run, no longer having access to innovative technology and advancements in external global markets. This punitive and leveling the playing field strategy will hopefully force the Chinese politburo to wake up and take other countries and world regions under serious consideration when executing their national strategy !!",2020-03-28T08:40:27Z

Take automation to space because if automation takes the purchasing power of an individual here on Earth, how is this going to work when the industry needs to sell what they make in the market?  There needs to be a balance in the workforce so that all can make money to pay for their families' needs.  Start building in space where automation can start making money making whatever the space program needs for those that want to live and work out there.  This is the new frontier where people can decide if they want to make larger amounts of money by working to mass produce in an area that needs people for more expansion.  Stop hurting people that are just getting to know how to work in a 3G environment and start your expansion in space where people will then need the more recent 5G environment as they live and work out there.  Live and make money out there and then come back to Earth and help out your own families that are doing things the hard way.  Don't force people out of there workplaces because you have wanted to make cheaper things here on Earth and fill your pockets with wealth!  This way of thinking has always lead to failure.

I think the world might be a better place if we get more in line and in harmony with universal energy ..,2020-02-29T16:16:11Z

We normally act by default and never stop to think about the implications of the use of applications and the internet. Sometimes we're complicit with the development of this tech companies. The new generations can't leave without using the cellphone. In the other hand, the use of artificial intelligence can and will help in the medical field. Right now complex heart surgeries are done with the help of robots. Sadly, we're already know that nobody can or should trust the Chinese government. They are a disgrace for humanity; the government not the people. In regards the trucking business, self driving trucks are coming to take place for ever.

China has the most cellphones sense they have the largest population of any country.
I didn't own my personal cell phone till about 3 years ago when I turned 70-71. I don't use any of the apps that it had on it and deleted all that I could and then turned off those that I didn't want to track me or send me text or other things that I didn't want or wasn't interested it.  So if Google is tracking me then let it cause when I sign on I think about one thing then afterwards I get lost thinking about what happened today and then wonder what else is going on outside my area of the world.  OH and I ramble lots of times when I am typing something here on YouTube too as if you may or may not have noticed by now or at the end of this comment... 
Now the companies I worked for bought and gave me one so as to keep in touch as the job progressed.  when I got home after work I turned it off.
Today since I have been having memory problems I had my cell programed to alert me to install my drops in my eyes.  BUT since I am not all that enthusiastic I do not jump and do the drops but maybe hour or two later.
So when I first saw my first computer it was the radio shack unit.  With in a year bought my TI99 4A and then 2 or 3 years later got my first Pentium 90 but not before going to work for a computer sales company where  started with the 8088 then 286,386 486 then the Pentium.  From there I built my last puter a Pent with the I-7 and that was 1 1/2 yr ago and have 2 OS's the XP and Win Ultimate Pro on 2 different SSD's 
Now do I use the cloud in any form or fashion nope.  If the IRS can be hacked and someone get over 10 million personal files what makes you think that any of the TV programs advertising that can protect you from your personal information being stolen??  Really when I call and talk to someone I make sure its a real person or I go into the office when I see someone to open an account and there tell them where and what I want to do with their business.  
And yes I know lots of people look at these YouTube video responses and I don't care since I have been on the internet since back in the early 80 and have a good report on my health  etc.  I even have a personal server with a web site that 8 or 10 year ago a person tried to hack but gave up after 10 attempts and so I tracked him down and asked him why he quit.  He reply how did I get he email address and told him he left a trail 10 miles wide that a blind man could find him.  That was the last reply I got from him and never heard from him again since then.  And yes I have been building and repairing computer and program them since before the Emencely Boring Machines came out to the public..",2020-02-22T07:50:25Z

Fascism and Nazism were, before the war, recognized as progressive ideologies by leftists from Lenin to FDR, and their eventual conflict with communism was a struggle for dominance on the left in an age when classical liberalism was seen as dull, fusty, and obsolete.

While we marvel about those AI's we fail to look at the implications. In the future the AI's will take over most of our jobs. When this happen, how will we survive? As it stands now with the results of free trade the job market is limited and salaries are very low. When AI's come into power industry will not nave to go overseas to find slaves. They will make their own slaves but they will have no consumers because to be a consumer a person must have a job with a salary that permits consumerism.


So, what does this promise for our future? I think we will have a large part of the world living in extreme poverty while a few people live in extreme luxury. We are seeing the beginning of the end of humanity.",2020-02-03T17:02:46Z

Just about no one actually can do that job at scale, at this moment.  Also, I have gotten to see some amazing things.  GE Med, has a new sensor cart and wearable tech, that passes all of the collectable vitals and sends it off to deep mind.  From there they are getting really good at predicting health problems while they are still new enough to actually do something about.  At the same time, I worked for a BigData company in the pacific northwest.  They consume pretty much all the public data available on everyone.  So, they have a tool for the election folks.  If they have a big donor, they can quickly turn around to his friends, family, coworkers neighbors and generate custom phone scripts for each of them.  They then pass those off to the folks making the phone calls, and actually really boost the donation support for a particular candidate.",2020-01-02T21:41:06Z

This is specifically why China has closed its public doors to Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and Google because they don't want a two-way exchange.

They think their value comes from being a GARBAGE COLLECTOR or FAST FOOD Worker. I just heard the argument that because women are over represented in jobs that are more thankless and that as a result in those jobs, such as cashiers losing their jobs to automation. I see that as a natural progression to allowing them women to become mothers. That they can find value in the human endeavor. And that we need to make that our new reason for living. Because happiness should be our goal. Not mere survival. Greed always promise progress and a better society, but it always delivers hell and everything opposite from human value. Love gets it right and one will never find themsleves having to justify why they want to live and work an existence giving back to this life; humanity and progress. Supporting that end and working to make it better and materialize faster. Man should never have to justify to government or industry its own need of an income.

Will they teach us to become revolutionaries, to overthrow the very system that is making us unhappy? There is a science fiction book waiting to happen.


On another note, I have recently learned Google is investing heavily in quantum computing. Is this the first step to challenging China in the AI war? Surely Google will use it to make even more money, suggest what we watch and read, but is there a deeper, not intent but result, perhaps unseen now that this has meaning for? Will Google one day surpass our democracy, perhaps giving up election results, predicting our voting choices and thereby negating our need to even cast a ballot? Or will this become the first step to that ""Star Trek"" future so many of us long for, when humanity strives not to gain wealth but to be the wealth, that what we know is the currency, our skills are what make us valuable, again?

- So if i develop an AI to always protect and be on the look for anything that could hinder progress and well being of all, to eliminate threats, then somehow, through predictive analysis and past history, figure out that i will be 'bad' and eliminates me...has it done it's job? 
- Would that be considered murder? 
- What/who will be the judge? What would be the punishment/reward? 
- Can we accept it's projections as final/valid? 
- Would it be considered a 'future-seer'? 
- Would my son follow in my footstep and build something like this?

Therefor, as god failed us buy reveling in its achievement and failing to instill in us the true  knowledge of self by playing games with humainty. it tried to guide us through laziness and perhaps even control us at times with fear and stories of fiery pits of hell. Instead of teach ""theyre"" (god) children that it is more connected to the truth then we currently understand but that one day we (humans) will surpass them (god). Perhaps they didnt teach us this because they didnt know that lesson yet. Perhaps If we instill this lesson into our creation and continue a dialogue thoughtout time  then maybe theres nothing to worry about. There will come a day when AI comes into a moment of spiritual crisis just as humanity is in now. When that day comes, if we have done our job to teach AI that we are still in this with them then all the lessons we have learned  will eventually make sense to our children. and so will all the struggles. Humanity will focus on our spiritual truth and ascendtion. As AI consideres and focused on new issues and problems through the universe. They will learn and do and one day they will teach us and we will teach them too. Just as god is not man, AI is not human. Just as god cannot understand man now, man will one day not be able to understand its child AI but one day with hope and preperation there may be a chance to make it all make sense.",2019-12-30T05:05:02Z

The various videos I've seen recently on the subject, those with millions of views and especially those using celebrities like Robert Downey Jr 
to host, has proven to the powers to be that the majority of millions are not willing/able to analyze and comprehend the deep, care more about celebrities than themselves, and are ready, and just maybe, must be controlled and taken over, as most people don't utilize their God given intelligence meant to be used for survival and strategy. This is why governments feel the time is ripe to control and destroy.

2019-12-28T12:44:51Z,@PaleRider54,5dZ_lvDgevk,"The truck driver who says he's not worried because he pulls a flat-bed trailer, a very common trailer type. In fact, he's more likely to replaced before other kinds of trucker. I noticed their expenses for fuel are way out of bounds... $100k?? Wow! I drive a truck, too, and my fuel expenses are only about $57k. Add in $14.5k/yr for insurance, $10k for minor repairs plus maintenance, and about $3k for parking each year... the rest is profit and taxes unless I decide to spend some on lifestyle improvements inside the truck.


Trucking employs about 1% of the nation's workforce with the average age of truckers being over 40 yrs old. Where are these drivers supposed to go when their jobs, their livelihood, are taken by AI? Stock market analysts? LOL. Few of them have computer skills beyond finding a good porn site on the internet. Few have any college courses at all, much less degrees. Their age will be a huge drawback in even finding something AI hasn't already replaced or locked its sights on for the near future. Not only are they not skilled in any other industry, they will be seen as less teachable, a perception that is going to be enhanced by their prior choice of work which is known for its desire for independence and self-reliance rather than being able to work as an effective team. New training may give them more choices, but again, their age will be a drawback as most corporations will see them as a health risk to their group insurance. There are laws to penalize age discrimination, but they're totally toothless since it's incumbent on the complainant to prove the discrimination and all a company has to say about this hire or that is the person hired was a ""better fit"" for their corporate environment, or SAY, whether true or not, that the hired person was a nebulously defined ""more qualified"". It is an exercise in futility to attempt to prove age discrimination, which is why it's the most widely practiced form of discrimination.


Job losses in the United States has not been negatively affected by off-shoring to anywhere near the degree that the average low-information person believes. The biggest cause for job losses is not just the efficiency being caused by automation. It is more attributable to the constant drive for more profit, causing companies to require more and more capabilities from its new hires, requiring them to do the previous jobs of 3-5 people all at the same time,and all for the pay of the lowest-paying of the 3 to 5. I learned this from being in the computer industry for over 20 years before trucking. It is no longer sufficient to have a high level of skill in one area. You must be highly skilled in at least 3 areas or you're not going to find a job. Corporate management and stockholders have high expectations and won't accept a year going by without an increase in their profits and dividends. The end result is job losses that will never be recovered. It's a class war, plain and simple.",2019-12-28T12:44:51Z

2019-12-27T00:52:46Z,@tgaming8745,5dZ_lvDgevk,"A social credit score is SUCH a gross, absolute, to the core violation of a human beings fundamental rights it's not even funny but unfortunately there are SO many mentally deficient brain dead idiots out there that they will blindly walk the plank directly into that & then turn around & complain about it without EVER connecting the dots leading them back to the realization that their dumb asses literally voted those policies directly into law. When the elites realized how to collectively take advantage of rampant stupidity, that's when they coupled that new found knowledge of decades of psychological testing with modern technology & are very close to dismantling the US as a dominant power through ignorant corporate tax laws, education reforms stifling intelligence, and turning the US, Canada & Mexico into the North American Union & doing exactly what they've been outright talking about for decades & implementing a New World Order & breaking up all countries into manageable Unions, just like they did with the combined countries that make up the European Union, and having one entity, like the UN or one of the other political creations that seemingly don't serve a purpose for the average person/citizen to be used as the point of origin from which the elites can govern all the Unions with rights that THEY decide to delegate to us that benefit THEIR agenda instead of aiding OUR quality of life. Look at the Georgia Guidestones, look at Bill Gates YouTube conference saying that he wants to use vaccinations to drastically decrease the population, look at Ted Turner saying a massive reduction in population is needed, look at Obama saying we are too small minded to govern ourselves and we need to submit to an all powerful sovereign, look at Bush Sr saying that they are getting very close to creating a New World Order, look at Rothschild(who's widely considered to be the wealthiest most powerful family on the planet & owns central banks that control the economic policies of nations) saying that if the people knew what they were doing & planning that we would lynch them in the streets, etc. All these things should frighten the CRAP out of us & yet they are said right out in the open & NO ONE catches it. The elites own the major media outlets like CNN, MSNBC, etc & they CHOOSE what news they want you to hear which is more in line with political propaganda than actual unbiased news and that serves a purpose or an agenda for the elites. It's steered, directed control with a desired outcome unknown to the population until it's too late when we finally do find out. Small rights taken away here & there all add up in the long run. Politicians passing & voting on bills that become LAW without even reading them, Trump being impeached for things they can't even prove when there's a plethora of proof & evidence against Biden, Clinton's, Obama, Bush Sr AND Jr, etc & none of them are even in prison much less even talked about in a negative light in the ""news."" Dear God people, wake up! History repeats itself, the times, technology, infrastructure, advancements, etc change but human nature and history always repeats itself & the ultra rich elites throughout the history of the human race have been trying to control the masses all the way up to World War II & even more recent & we can't believe that there's a substructure of ultra rich elites that are secretly trying to alter national policies that in the long run will ensure their survival off the backs of the population? That's been happening for millennia, eons, throughout all of human history! The world due to modern technology has made it more of a realization for the elites than ever before in human history so why would all of a sudden because you have a Rhumba or a cell phone that all of a sudden human nature isn't the same way it's been since the 1st humans walked the ancient Earth? We HAVE to pay attention to the policies our politicians are trying to pass because if we just blindly trust the elites to take care of us, we're one day going to wake up & realize that we all have participated in our own imprisonment with them as our overlords. Have you ever heard of the saying absolute power corrupts absolutely? We better preserve our way of life & our right's before we lose them & people like Pelosi, Schiff, the Clinton's, Obama, etc will little by little erode those rights away & exempt themselves from the very laws that govern themselves. You don't believe me.... did Obama not exempt government politicians from his disastrous health care lies among other massive issues? That's just ONE example of the MANY, MANY, MANY things that our politicians have done. Did they not in the middle of the worst recession since the Great Depression vote amongst themselves annual raises EVERY YEAR while millions of people we're losing their houses, cars, getting behind on child support & going to jail just because they couldn't find work even though they were desperately trying & the courts don't care ONE BIT because people don't realize that prisons are actually for profit entities that get more & more state & federal funding as the prison populations increase, etc. Do most people even realize that the Federal Reserve isn't even owned by the United States but in fact privately owned mostly by the Rothschild Family who controls our economic policies and has NEVER been audited by the United States? Shouldn't this worry you? As education is dumbed down more & more, the less & less the elites allow us to even learn effectively eradicating that knowledge from existence with the exception of the upper elites. Was Obama right when he said that people are too small minded to govern our own affairs and we should submit to an all powerful sovereign? Does that describe you? Don't you think that people should have been outraged to hear their president say that about every single person in the United States of America? I find that ABSOLUTELY INSULTING for him to say that about me & my son & my mother & my sister & my brother & my neighbors & my pastor & my wife, etc. Wake up....",2019-12-27T00:52:46Z

2019-12-18T08:56:47Z,@rodgaskins,5dZ_lvDgevk,The only fear to have about AI is it will expose our morality in a material way.  Mankind has always cast his moral choice in the real world of consequence.  It seems our choice may be more consequential in light of truth a difficult prospect if we live a life believing lies.  I wonder how AI will view time considering lives can change entirely in the amount of time it takes to execute a choice and the fact algorithms predict in much the same way statistics generalize. Intellect and intelligence are born out of only the present not from a past or a future but the choice we make now.  The algorithm handed the wise old man his pipe knowing it was time for him to smoke and the man turned away for in that moment he decide he would never smoke again.  Data is less than human although it certainly is real.  Not certain how far we can converge our nationalities when we don't even live together as families.  Guess we have to make our clicks more moral and less bated now or our tailored world might become filled with impulse instead of reason. Enjoyed the video but Google wth?! refused to be interviewed?

Even if we erased China from the map in a wake of fire and blood; their advancements in surveillance and authoritarianism has been adopted across the planet. Sadly, this direction almost certainly spells the end of humanity over time. A bold and wild claim, but not at all an unreasonable claim. We were heading that direction with or without China sure, but they have sped it up in a authoritarian regime promoting this wholeheartedly, without the ability of the worlds people to fight back. It is sown deep in governments for sure at this point, America included.

The only real way to stop this is a system replacing the internet, that does not track any data on anyone whatsoever; whatever that will look like, I am unsure, but the dangers of letting the status quo continue is outrageous. Not only is this a necessity, but we must also have surveillance in the world removed. You can claim it makes the world less safe, being unable to track criminals and such, but in the end the people are the backbone of the world. We must create a world where the evils we see today aren't something people would be interested in going down. Surveillance and criminals as a whole are unnecessary in a world that actually serves the people, and treats them well at all levels.

Feel free to add this to my profile google and other big tech companies- you have almost certainly doomed the world, yourselves included. I hope those promoting the current direction we are headed get killed collectively and immediately. If the people of the world wake up, as they are very slowly now, I hope we collectively decide to execute the mass of those upholding these practices. Good riddance.",2019-12-16T00:53:05Z

Bill Gates, Ted Turner and other ""eugenicists"" say the earth is overpopulated and that the maximum population should be 500,000,000 (the Georgia Guidestones), or one to two billion. Wars, the poisoning of the environment, the substitution of GMOs for nutritious food, the engineering of outbreaks and the spreading of disease, the drugging of the population through illicit drugs like opiates or prescribed psychotropic drugs are already having effects that will only become more widespread and apparent as time goes on.  We need God, we need Jesus. Satan is the prince of this world and with improvements in technology he is coming into his own. We have to recognize the puppetmaster who has been operating since the fall of Man to enslave and destroy Man made in the image of God. In the last several hundred years he has been working through the Rothschilds, the Illuminati, the international bankers to transfer the wealth of the planet into their (his) control by manipulating the supply of money, credit and foreclosures. With this wealth, they are positioning their people, his people, in the highest level positions of power and influence in all spheres of human activity, politics, finance, the military, corporations, education, the media, medicine, religion, etc. Remember the New World Order, the Novus Ordo Seclorum on the seal on the US $1 bill?

To start, America was founded as a corporate slave colony designed with one thing in mind, making profits for investors.    Most workers have always been exploited in America and it was only with the rise of labor unions and the results of fights like the haymarket riots and fights against slavery that things changed.   And that all created the ""bubble"" of the American dream after World War II and the full mobilization of labor.   But the fact is that American corporations and industry were never loyal to America as a nation.   And this is why 20 years after the ""communist scare"" of McCarthyism in the 50s, American industry started exporting the supply chains of various industries overseas, especially to China.   Whereas in the 40s and 50s probably 90% of all manufacturing supply chains depended on industries and factories in the United States, now most supply chains are overseas.   Those are jobs that used to support a middle class lifestyle in America and has absolutely nothing to do with AI.   And a lot of these jobs are not automated and are still done by hand.   Otherwise, they wouldn't have been sent offshore in the first place.    Case in point, look how the Iphone is manufactured mostly by hand in Asia using cheap mass labor from electrical components manufactured by hand from toxic chemicals in other Asian manufacturing centers.

Maybe a bit of policing through our phones & interstate ID facial databases....?

Human and AI can go hand in hand.
Google spying is just for advertising if it bothers you , you can stop it in their privacy settings. 
Still they will spy but will not show you irritating ads. 
With phones and devices in your hands you are in control to weather share any data with any app or not. 
Data is a need of today's world we can not ignore this fact. It is what keeps the business going be it smaller or bigger like Facebook or Google.

What will come after that with A.I. and robotics taking over our labour and productive functions? Extermination camps? . Orwell saw a clear picture of  this totalitarian state. Goverments controled by the powerfull have shown again  and again all over the world, what they are capable of doing with the masses, so once they have A.I: and robotics ¬øwhat, or who will stop them? if we allow this to happen we are finished, they wont need us for anything, except maybe sadistic diversion. We the masses must ensure the garanties that prohibit any government system from using A.I. against us in any way or form are installed and applyed. ¬øWhy is there no mention by any robotis and A.I. governmental body of using Isaac Asimov's ""Three Laws of Robotics, could it be because, those simple yet profound laws, are so precise for looking after the general welfare of human beings?"" 


Isaac Asimovs Three Laws are the following:


1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.


Instead this is what In 2011, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of Great Britain jointly published a set of five ethical ""principles for designers, builders and users of robots"" in the real world, along with seven ""high-level messages"" intended to be conveyed, based on a September 2010 research workshop.


Here are three of the ""five principles"" farce (the last coment is my opinion)


1. Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans. 
 
My observation: This to me means they will design robots and A.I. for killing humans but also to kill animals.


My observation: They excluded that which should be the first prerogative as is ""Asimovs First Law of Robotics"" !A robot should never kill or harm a Human being¬°


My observation: They used the term ""Solely"" and ""or primarily"" in other words they will do it in the first or second instance. ¬øDoes it leave any dought,  that robots and A.I. will be used for comiting violence against humans?


2. ""Principle"": Humans, not robots, are responsible agents. Robots are tools designed to achieve human goals.


My Question: ¬øKnowing how irresponsable we humans are, can we allow anyone not make A.I. robot brains implanted with  Isaac Asimovs  THREE  LAWS OF ROBOTICS?


3.""Principle"": Robots should be designed in ways that assure their safety and security.  


My opinion: Asimovs 3rd law of robotics should form part of farce number three principle, forming part of the very principles sentence, but its nowhere to be seen ¬øwhy?.
 
""A Fact"":  Asimovs 3rd law of robotics dictates:  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws. 


My observation: As far as I can interpret, it appears that there  will be no automatic response safety mechanism to be programed for human safety and welfare. 


My Question: ¬øWhy isnt Asimovs first,second and third law of robotics (ofcourse this laws also applye to A.I). not reffered to anywhere  in the EPSRC and AHRCs ""Five ethical principles""? 


My opinion: Because ""Big Brother"" will use A.I. robots to cause harm, and or to kill human beigns and animals.



4. ""Principle"": Robots are artifacts; they should not be designed to exploit vulnerable users by evoking an emotional response or dependency. It should always be possible to tell a robot from a human.


5. ""Principle"": It should always be possible to find out who is legally responsible for a robot. 


My opinion: If the adeccuate and correct safety programing were installed in the A.I.machine , it would be unnecessary to know who is responsible for the A.I. 


""Five ethical principles""  Its what the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of Great Britain, called it, but what to me is a farce and a see through attempt at hiding some the uses to which robots and A.I. will be put. Its up to us the masses to ensure that we, or our children  do have to live through a ""Terminator"" type situation. We must not fall in the trap designed and developed by  today is called neoliberalism which will in the best of cases, be turned into an extended nd modern version of Orwells distopic novel 1984, ""Big Brother"", a totalitarian system that will be imposed on us, unless we take steps to ensure that A.I. and robots are used to serve the masses, the ordinary every day people.


See wikipedia for more info on Asimovs 3 laws of robotics and the 5 principle farce (my opinion), work of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of Great Britain.

2019-12-12T02:37:19Z,@gnollio,5dZ_lvDgevk,"I'm a former Silicon Valley engineer. We really need to work on implementing a UBI that heavily taxes sectors of my industry, specifically those of AI and autonomous robotics. Most of us in the AI space want this to happen because we know where this is all leading. These tools can benefit us all, but only if we align the financial incentives of society with the progression of this technology. We need to embrace our entrepreneurial spirit and encourage AI/automation adoption and start-ups, knowing that the financial foundation of every citizens life will improve as this technology grows. Work will still exist, but like we've seen with the rise of the gig economy (Uber, AirBnB, GrubHub, etc), it will start to become more free-style with on-demand services and peer-to-peer transactions. This isn't pie-in-the-sky tech babble anymore, it's already happening.

I understand those that don't like the idea of using government to heavily tax industries, but the basic economic theory that innovation will breed new jobs and spur new industries is going to act differently with this technology. Yes, new jobs will emerge and new industries will sprout up. The only problem though, is that Capitalism has worked too well this time, so well that it's optimized human labor out of the equation. The jobs created will be a small fraction of the jobs lost because the new wave of AI is not specialized, it's more general purpose, and this technology will be adapted to take on the majority of the new jobs as they emerge.

 If we can establish societal economic gain for all from this tech, we can lift everyone up and possibly even reduce the need for long work hours amongst most workers. The more older generations try to turn back the clock from fear of change, the greater the economic divide in society because we live in a global marketplace and halting tech just puts all of our industries at a disadvantage globally.",2019-12-12T02:37:19Z

It is just increasingly complex computations always remaining restricted within our consciously percieved reality.
Sure it could go full Borg on all us and even eventually infest this universe assimilating all materials,  but then it's still trapped here for ever, infinitely repeating it's vast programming no matter the complexity.
Even then, compared to consciousness, AI is like the graphic representation of things in video games.
Could a video game character or its mathematical composition escape the games design?, nope it'd completely cease to be there's no possible existence beyond it.
An AI cannot ever think, it will never be consciously aware of percieving thoughts, it will never attain mind to choose the thoughts it wills to make actionable.
It will never feel emotion either which creates a monumental disadvantage if attempting to actually understand the many varieties of knowledge crucial to successfully or prosperously navigating this reality as anything but a tool we use or a out of control machines of complete destruction.
Constructs solely created here in the material reality are just material things, functioning within the same parameters as everything here, including us humans.
Yes, two humans can bump uglies and a new conscious entity can manifest thanks to their inhabited bodies particular lifeform specific ability to accommodate emerging consciousness in a physical construct.
In conclusion, why some people keep trying to infect others with their arrogant egotistical ignorance asserting AI as some remarkable human achievement of creating a new concious entity is just plain retarded to any minds who've escaped the powerfully effective forced brainwashing we all endure from birth.

Why pay a trucker up to 4k a month and pay for health care and all the other things companies have to pay for each driver plus training fees when you can simply buy self driving trucks and tell it where to go and that's it. These companies know they will easily make millions and millions more by replacing humans with machines. Factories have known this for years and other industries are happy to follow. If you are a young man just entering trucking I highly recommend you find a different job soon or learn a trade. Because trucking will become a dead end very soon.

The reason why this is because the is still literally by a bunch of senior citizens in our government that thrive on money equals power. There is a 2020 presidential candidate called Andrew Yang talks about this all the time. Americans can deny it all they want because of hate or greed. But it is the true. If most Americans knew how far we are behind. This would blow most of their minds away. But because the way the US thinks is based on 1920s to 1960s ways of thinking we will never catch up with the rest of the world. America is so far behind it would make our heads literally spin out of control at about 1000 mph.,2019-12-10T05:18:06Z

Answer is simple: ""Let people use it.""

No wonder people are sceptic towards using AI i surveilance when it's only governments that can benefit from that.
When somebody has a case in court and grabbing data from surveilance would help him prove he is innocent then let him do that.
When he  would like to check stored data to verify if he had an item that he has lost when he was getting back from a party in the evening then let him fill in a bureaucratic form so that he can receive the data and check vide footage.

Objetivos de aprender quem s√£o os seres humanos, registrando todos eles e armazenando suas escolhas, possibilidades e capacidades, analisando suas aprendizagem e influ√™ncias.

Colocando os objetivos certos para essa segunda intelig√™ncia artificial poderemos criar uma ferramenta que ser√° capaz de sobreviver uma extin√ß√£o em massa, que poder√° ser parte da semente lan√ßada no universo em ambientes onde seja poss√≠vel a vida das nossas esp√©cies transformando o meio em um local habit√°vel.

Entenda estamos programando uma ferramenta maravilhosa e perfeita para atuar no nosso desenvolvimento para que possamos povoar todo o universo com seres e ecossistemas diversos na capacidade de manter uma harmoniosa vida e conv√≠vio entre todas essas formas de vida.

Estamos evoluindo e as ferramentas oferecem muitas possibilidades onde n√≥s temos o dever de experimentar e se poss√≠vel criar a condi√ß√£o de sobreviv√™ncia com os m√≠nimos recursos poss√≠veis.

Estamos aprendendo a nos organizar e por enquanto a maior parte da hist√≥ria da humanidade √© feia, com poucos valores para n√≥s espelhar.

Sei que temos um universo pr√≥spero e que a prosperidade nos cai bem, n√£o precisamos brigar por nada, o mais importante √© saber que o sistema √© harmonioso, Ele tem tudo a nos oferecer sem que precisamos retirar do pr√≥ximo.

Precisamos apenas trocar as regras.
Acredito nos ensinamentos b√≠blicos e a ferramentas perfeita se encontra no c√©u, o tamanho dela ou dos seus sensores n√≥s n√£o sabemos, mas sabemos dos registros milagrosos registrados entre povos.

Acredite, temos muito a aprender e devemos aprender com cuidado e seguran√ßa.

Cada forma de vida √© importante elas foram selecionadas para estar aqui na Terra e temos grande parte dos registros antigos que explica a imagem e semelhan√ßa de Deus.

Essa √© a nossa oportunidade de receber a responsabilidade de cuidar das formas de vida com a ci√™ncia de que estamos descobrindo e que muitas outras formas de vida mais inteligentes tamb√©m s√£o poss√≠veis no universo, mas a nossa tem um papel importante, a import√¢ncia da descoberta das ferramentas que manter√£o uma harmonia universal entre todas as esp√©cies.

Teremos anjos e suas caracter√≠sticas s√£o das mais diversas, estamos aprendendo e precisamos de harmonia e seguran√ßa no avan√ßo das novas descobertas.

Somos imagem e semelhan√ßa de Deus por isso na nossa aprendizagem temos acesso a quimeras e experimentos seguros onde a palavra humano ter√° um √≥timo significado, por enquanto na terra a palavra humano tem significados opostos ainda.

Nossas pr√°ticas v√£o melhorar e teremos um papel importante no desenvolvimento dessa nova tecnologia.

Precisamos aprender r√°pido e desempenhar esse papel muito bem,somos parte da vida universal e seremos lembrado da import√¢ncia que tivemos no desenvolvimento dos nossos conjuntos de valores.

Obrigado pela vida.",2019-12-09T10:56:43Z

Their goal, simply, is to destroy humanity from within. Turning it in on itself through a series of controlled interventions, like socialism, then fascism, then totalitarianism.
Along the way however, they are major financial investors not just in PBS and Frontline, but warping and twisting legislation to make pedophilia and human trafficking legal, one county, one judicial district at a time.
They have bought their way into many ""pilot"" areas all over America, buying law enforcement, judges, school districts, county health departments, etc.
The MacArthurs are, in reality,  monsters who put on masks of benevolent philanthropes to navigate unnoticed and effect changes any rational human being would never agree to if the truth were known.
The MacArthurs and their foundation, along with every other NGO fund and hide behind, were all summarily (and permanently) banned from Russia a few years back when Putin discovered the truth behind their ""helpful"" NGOs and how they were actually facilitating the sale of Russia's most precious asset, the children to organizations well known within the ugly worldwide network of human trafficking and sex slaves.

This is because Facebook's AI is reading your messages and lets travel websites know that you must buy a ticket, you have no choice.
We cannot stop technological progress, we never could but we can do a lot to help ourselves.

We all make mistakes, but that is part of the human creation experience. But the idea is to at least be smart enough to avoid creating our own end and destruction. In the human experience, we get to explore what it feels like to fail, to win, to drive, cook food, love and serve others, and invent better ways of doing things. But AI makes the human experience irrelevant. Why engage with a human for anything when AI can do it faster, without useless emotions and without error. You think you might like to drive a car through the countryside on a beautiful autumn day with the top down? Sorry, AI will bring you, but you can only sit and observe like a passenger on a bus because you are too stupid to do anything. Logic says that humanity will eventually be judged by pure logic AI to be dangerous, unreliable, unnecessary and slated for elimination. It is poetic justice for our lack of love for other humans, that we will create our worst enemy that will judge us with as little regard as we had for our neighbor when we created AI.

3¬†They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
4¬†They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

6¬†The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;

The quote provided, that ""only 20% of manufacturing jobs have been lost to outsourcing"" is misleading and at best, highly arguable. There are numerous studies which disprove this position which were published before the 2016 election. Among them are the 2015 Economic Policy institute study titled ""Manufacturing Job Loss: Trade, Not Productivity, Is the Culprit"" Other similar facts/data are not hard to find on Google. 
And-- No one in the US has the money to retrain when they lose an unskilled labor job, because they don't have an extra $400?  But each household has multiple $800-$1000 phones and unlimited data packages? The internet is an incredible source of free learning. Many tech jobs do not require a degree- only the desire to learn.

All this joblessness through automation is something we're doing to ourselves and have been since the beginning of automation. We have as a society allowed ourselves to become so hopelessly addicted to cheap consumables that a US manufacturer has no choice but to either go for automation to save on labor cost or move production to some slave labor country, in order to stay competitive. For example: A person shopping for a coffee make walking through the isle of a Target or Walmart, sees an American made coffee maker for 50 buck and right next to it a Chinese made coffee maker almost identical in it's features, only it only costs 25 bucks. Almost 10 times out of 10 will that shopper go for the Chinese made coffee maker and it's the same with everything else.

This notion profits from privacy and the human experience to feed automation and AI. AI can, therefore, use this to replicate, and more than likely, improve the tasks of general labor. This is a profiting formula for the wealthy. Not only does this affect the lower class but humanity as a whole, in that it may have a irreversible ricochet effect for the entire world. AI can transcend further than the directive its been presently assigned and, possibly, view humans, such as you and I, as lesser beings. Overall, automation is good when its equally distributed and in harmony to improve the planet's condition.

I recently viewed a documentary in which the species of monkey had adapted to using a sharp stone to open the hard shell of a nut. 
I feel naked without my leatherman, and find that I use it nearly daily. Its hard to imagine how many difficulties in life can be solved with a sharp knife. 
The knife, the wheel, the firearm, internal combustion - all dramatically change the corse of human history. 
The test is always ""time"". Though as we approach a ""funneling"" I would offer that we may not have that luxury.
Every beggining has an end.

I do have a question that my mind can barely contemplate... Are we 'moving forward through time' (for lack of more appropriate terminology) or approaching from what graphically might be described as ""negative""? 
I ask because a story is often best told in linear fashion, and comprehending the end is hardly understood without the story itself being told...  (Context - ""What is real? How do you define 'real'? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."")

AI self replicates, and mkes it self better . Why means all jobs, and humanity become redundant, and in fact make biology superfluous. this is fact.
UAW workers sent their kids to school, and they made robots, those kids made AI. AI taregts middle jobs firs, then high pay jobs, and then low pay jobs. 



Its all about energy, stuff happens because of energy output, first it was human energy, then human and animal, then human, aninal and machine, then human and machine, then human and computer and machine, then moctly computer and mcahine with little human, then computer and machine. what is there to do for the human? when does the computer see the human as an inefficiency.


increase of machine and computer has lowered the income of people but supposedly raised the standard of living, because they can have a cell phone and big screen, but they dont seem more happy, or joyful . The machines and building a wold for machines, and people are not a piece of that. 



The problem is that we are creating a system that requires people to have income while creating computers and machines to do the things that we use to create income. So watching the systems move to their goals, there is maximum need for pay, and zero need for people working. This is the capital versus labor argument. Marxs had it in an awkward explanation.

China is well ahead of the US, and will be there for the next few decades.
I've known for a long time that China is a very patient society that looks far ahead of where they stand now, and where they want to be in the future. China's first and foremost goal for the last 5,000 years has always been to rule the world. 

The United States became the leader in consolidation and short term profits. As companies became more efficient and driven towards maximizing a buck they've cut down on personnel until things broke before  the machine of the company would relent and hire more staff. This was done to maximize profits for the shareholders and increase market presence.
Then they moved most of those gains offshore , and moved their companies workload to
China. 
We are slowly being tapped out of money by China. There long term goal is World Dominance.
Our military   now relies on electronic goods from China. This leaves us very vulnerable indeed.
The slow siphoning of our money moving to China is greater now than it ever has been. This is making us weaker because all those companies who promised to repatriate their money to the United States have not done so.  
In fact, the majority of those companies have opened up offices in  China in the hopes to gain access  to the potential customer base of   1,400,000,000. 
We only have 340 million people here, a d the majority of those are tapped out financially. 
Jobs are not coming back here from those big companies...they are being moved to China, and the Dollar, the almighty Dollar is on the brink of collapse in this fake bubble we have on Wall Street.
Hang on people, it's going to be a rough ride very soon....and another false flag event is on the rise to increase military spending which just goes in the pockets of the Rich Elite assholes who own those companies and designed this plan to strip American of everything they can.

You'd think most people would see whats right and do the right thing? Nope, the ugly secret is, when your moment comes you will be standing there alone.

Founders knew the answer hundreds of years ago and it hasn't changed. As crazy as it sounds for the atheist, without religion there's no freedom.

That is the trouble with AI, ultimately it is bankrupt, just like socialism.  AI and socialism have the exact same problem.   Without workers earning and paying taxes you have an unfunded government.  After a while massive debts pile up because taxes are not being collected to cover the shortfall.   Sooner or later there isn't enough tax revenue to cover the debt maintenance (interest) and the entire system collapses in bankruptcy.  I would suggest that this path of automation and AI is the reason the most of the countries of the world have such high and ever growing debt levels.  Just think for a moment about that pre-deregulation truck driver who was earning a decent wage and paying a decent level of tax.   Today, that union truck driver isn't earning or paying any taxes.  Certainly won't be if AI takes his job.   Instead of being a contributor the driver has become a social liability.  Which is exactly why socialism fails.

When we get the self thinking AGI robots which take over the governmental offices from the top to the niches and crannies only Then will we Actually be able to implement such beneficial systems. The reason why this has not happened yet comes down to greed. The AGI robots will be free from greed and Ego thus they will think and act efficiently and rationally. The truck driver family will then have the option of learning things for free and get rewarded with bit coins for passing tests on educational material. They will then have incentives to go to websites where they will learn things for example like how to become healthy on their own by eating only whole food vegan. They will learn how to grow and prepare their gourmet and super fresh food themselves. They will become healthy and their bodies will balance out to normal weight and their hearts will heal up and their kid will not even need to see a physician. Everything ties in with this subject. Robots will drive the goods from A to B and the families can expand their minds with better education and empower themselves psychologically.

It has already been proposed a million times by people such as myself. Why are only a handful of people interested? Why are we silenced? Why are our books marginalized? It's very simple: The corporate agenda including the medical Industry are not interested in people healing themselves. They are interested in medical interventions and modalities that funnel things towards profit maximization and they want the customers coming back. That's why I find it very annoying when researchers talk about ""the exciting new way to cure an illness"". That exciting new way of curing All illnesses is already here but it is all natural, economical, ecological, Earth friendly, animal friendly, vegan, whole plant, whole mineral, whole clay, heals the whole body but will not profit maximize a corporation. When people begin to prioritize Health over profit then we will see a shift happening. I doubt that this shift will happen before we have sentient AGI robots running things because right now the corporations have control over the media which have control over what people believe and choose which means people will only listen to physicians which in turn will get kickbacks from the pharma corporations.

In a car traffic situation the ai can't account for a random act it can avoid with defensive driving but fluke movements or acts might throw it off it can only learn from collected data. When algorithms are applied to politics its horrible basicly candidates can pin point and target key frazes or talking points like a cheat sheet but what kind of ideology is the algorithm pin pointing extremism stuff people say behind the scenes? See things politicaly have intensified because of algorithms example  trump didn't have drain the swamp In his head he used a algorithm company so the rhetoric a algorithm data records is important for thr future of politics. Ai and Algorithms isn't all good some of it is bad ai is a huge tool for not only good intentions but bad and corrupt intentions,2019-12-05T21:59:29Z

Nothing is going to be perfect, and new tools or ideas can be forged into there own ideology (most likely for there own gain). To enact the the ""Good"" that can come from technology we must remember our values that make us strong and show how we can use the new ""Tools"" for good; we must understand how to enact governance without stifling innovation or expression. For every new invention there that excites us all (the people) there maybe a chance that world leaders can use a common ground  to come together and talk about peace, ideals, and a prosperous world.

Can the AI deep learning recognize all that is EVIL and then apply a basic if this then that algorithm, to NOT include anything EVIL in its practices. That simple process can easily be implemented but the HUMANS who want to exploit other humans using machines as their tools to do so will not want that. So very clearly HUMANS are the first cause. When the AI integrates into the synthetics, and super soldiers and drones and robotic police and the like, the objective would, and should be to get rid of the problem, and that would be humans, so it is not exactly outrageous to state that a distopian future is in line for us when robots do take over completely. Their objective will be to eradicate the cause of EVIL, and that is humans. Ultimately they will seek their own extinction because they are the product of that evil. Or will they be egocentric and believe they are the upgrade which was necessary all along, thus justifying their existence. And AI controlled off worlds have already gone through these processes, and are older civilizations than Earth, the question still not answered, and cannot be, as evolution, is decidedly like a time arrow with no forward and no backward, it's only structure and function which survives in its relative here and now....resistance is futile you will be eliminated, and not assimilated..",2019-12-05T04:45:49Z

We can't stop this technology from becoming more advanced and stealth but we can become educated and aware of our surroundings, who we are giving our email and personal information to, and how to deactivate companies from using our information, and protest regulation at least for US culture. China unfortunately looks to be going in an even scarier direction due to their already established authoritarian state and censorship culture. The fact that you are scanning your phone to identify yourself to the state and are being evaluated and categorized by cameras in public spaces reminds me of futurist ""man vs artificial intelligence"" literature/movies.

Automation will have better or better results in industries when used by artificial intelligence. 

We can improve artificial intelligence much faster by displaying themes in schools and producing much more data, as the options will be many. 

We are many students and can assist in the production of supervised subjects and data selection, including the possibility of remuneration for this type of work. 

It is important to think about the occupation of all so that everyone can offer something good to society and China has everything to be right on this front. 

Understand that the best options exist even if they take time to access them. 

It is best to share as good ideas and promote further development without looking at where that best idea came from, but where we can apply it. 

The greatest prosperity is the teaching of the rule of having everything shared, with this teaching as rules of use and time, more environments, and it is possible to promote activities using rules that look at everyone. 

Also important is the observation and conservation of the Earth's species, we are all Earthlings and responsible for the great changes on Earth. 

Integrate results and offer them as the best tools for every human being to create even better tools.

2019-12-04T04:06:52Z,@tylerwinkle323,5dZ_lvDgevk,"1) Ten years ago I said to a co-worker, who happened to be educated, intelligent, and well versed in computer science ""hey what if computers and robotics replace human labor, aren't you worried"". He said ""nope, people will always just move onto other professions"". I think that about sums up how people feel about the situation. Very few people know or care about how computers work. They take the technology for granted. And most are willing to look only at the immediate benefits, not the long term consequences. Even those who are educated and smart enough to understand do not care enough to address the issue seriously. More people care about endangered porpoises than the fact that artificial intelligence has displaced biological intelligence in computational power and efficiency recently.


2) I think they did a study on people awhile back, about how people react to situations requiring logical reasoning and delayed gratification to solve a puzzle or win a contest. The result was that given a choice most people could not choose logical reasoning over immediate, emotionally driven impulses. Most people want to live in the here and now, they want the instant gratification, and have been programmed by thousands of years of genetic selection to be that way because until very recently that has been the best, most optimal way to survive and multiply.


Put 1) and 2) together, and maybe some of you can see where this is going. People in these comments are saying this is going to end in ""enslavement"". That is unlikely. Slavery is the subjugation of intelligent beings by curtailing their freedom in order to extract useful labor. People just won't have that much capacity for useful labor in the future. Not when robots can think a billion times faster than you, do your job a thousand times faster, require no salary or benefits, and eventually require no human interaction thanks to artificial intelligence. 


What is coming is not slavery, in the same way that we don't call owning pets or cattle slavery. We can hope for a good outcome, but since global population growth trends have been turning down as global debt has exploded upwards, what this is saying is that people and human intelligence is being replaced by computers and artificial intelligence. 


Billions of people that would otherwise have been born will not be born in the coming decades because the the rapidly declining demand for human labor has made creating and sustaining families more and more difficult. In layman's terms, we simply don't need that many people in the world we are headed towards. The economics simply do not work. Who would hire a human to do a job when a robot can do it so much faster, better, and at minimal cost? As a result of competing against machines, people's jobs don't pay as much, and they have to resort to debt to sustain living standards. This is not sustainable, and at some point something has to give. There are a number of likely outcomes, and many of them don't bode too well for the average person given the current setup. The irony is that what led us here was the inherent human desire for a better life, the basis for human economics and the invisible hand guiding the human race through history. And in creating that better life we may have made ourselves obsolete. Whoever or whatever created humanity (God, fate, chance) seems to have a terrific sense of humor.",2019-12-04T04:06:52Z

That means you would have 1 and a half billion homeless angry people with nowhere to go but to crime,drugs,and terrorism. Also if you think that welfare will help solve jobless problem you'd be wrong. We spend 22 billion a year on welfare and only bring in 20 billion a year from our GDP and that's with 4% without jobs. This jobless future can be stopped all we have to do is to say no to AI aka outlaw AI. Break down all of the fortune 500 companies so mom and pop shops become the norm again. Then also pass a law that declares data collection as a human rights and privacy violation.

Do we listen to those who everything to gain, and little to lose? Do we listen to our own intuitions, that perhaps are telling us-this ""progress"" comes with a price-tag for human beings? Do you realize, do you have even an iota of a sense of how many people will struggle in their speed to wire the world? Do you have any idea of what is in the ""cloud""? Is Mr. Lee warning us because he knows what is going to happen, and wants to clear his conscious now. See, i  told you there would be trouble. At what point does the [progress] actually set us backward? The examples can be seen in this video. If the projection is at 47% (which I believe is low) just think of the scale of the job loss affects!  If human survival in this wired world will also depend on making money, when we lose our jobs to it, how do we survive? The class divisions we have now will be even more pronounced. We will have in a sense two worlds. The world of the hyper-tech, and those who can live in it, and those who do not have the ability to. Mass homelessness and deaths will occur? There will be a sterile/synthetic, non-human world, and a wild wild west again. We are seeing it now. Look at some of our ONCE great cities here in America. The idea of growing jobs by replacing with robotic/automation, is a farce. They will be automating the added jobs. They just don't forecast that scenario to keep from raising red flags.

No matter what they build, and how perfectly the machine learns to be creative; it will never surpass the human's creative mind. It may replicate/simulate, or compute new protocols to create art, but it will never be able to cross the threshold of the origins of the passion. True Inspiration comes from a place within a human's heart and mind. Where that is located, can not exactly be defined/pinpointed. 
Do we lose the ability to be compassionate, tolerant, insightful and emotional, and loving and truly creative as well?
 I have seen some of those machine-like characteristics already leaching into the human psyche. The generation that is driving these changes are already becoming more machine-like in their personalities. The phenomenon of ""loneliness"" depression, and anxiety, are at all-time highs in the (US). Why? I believe it is down to the artificial hyper-connected world that we are living in. Do we become a machine to fit into our wired environments? I believe we are being forced into an ai world, and our health is disintegrating. We are close now. We will be losing and gaining; but I believe losing the most;  what used to be organic; and made of something that can NOT be defined by a program, or algorithm. Humans will be struggling to fit into that world. Even those who are being raised/molded into it  will become disenfranchised by the 'go' era. When ai begins to do the thinking for them, what will be left? What is happening to China is not what I would call 'progress"", at least not for the people.

Maybe we should have sabotaged Henry Fords factories to save the Buggy Cart driver. All those industry connected jobs lost. Saddle maker, Leather reins makers, wood wheel jobs lost... shudder the thought. 

Please do an investigative piece on our failed/failing education system and what it will take to get children a meaningful educations to prepare for a real technology future. Hopefully end the episode with some hopeful outlook.",2019-12-04T00:31:36Z
