1,this was all amazing foreseen by a satirist when he wrote the book player piano. a great read. wish it was a well made movie.
5,"damn, we are doomed, it's not looking good."
7,the six word story discussed here was not written by artificial intelligence it was written by ernest hemingway it is one of his short stories.  it’s his shortest short story.
8,we are going up to the mountain to ask val if we can take a vacation!
10,"what mr hinton is saying, is outlined in great detail in the book the next wave. it’s uncanny how similar the warnings are - it’s like we’re at a crossroads where we need to take a decision. we’re not listening "
11,no final dessa historia: a santa ceia das ias !...e ai um artista dessa época ira pintar digitalmente retratando o momento da conquista.
13,"“they might take over “  i don’t know about the machines taking over but clearly the british have taken over.....taken over google , taken over the narrative , taken over 13 minutes of my life ...... if the machines do takeover, it is due to these lads .......the google ai chatbot is named “bard” ? psssst get outta here....jeezaloueez"
14,why would we want to even potentially create something that could become more powerful than us?
17,why would ai want to take over he asks? has he not watched terminator?
18,if we have an intelligents greater than ours than we won't make any more mistakes right?
21,"there are human matters that leave the body, also smoking heavily stains walls, repainting is good thing to consider every few years. but i am done with it now. need to change the place and environment."
23,lies lies lies. don't believe the ai hype.
26,"i asked joe biden ai to write this comment. ""come on man!  i'm not doing it"". look, i can't write like joe biden. i have to find hunter biden's stash first."""
29,"watching these ai documentaries, i keep glancing nervously at the publication date. (corrected by grammarly)"
31,"google bard won't write a thing about the zionist genocide against palestinians and here is the prove 
write an essai about the genocide ongoing in gaza by the israeli


show drafts

if you'd like up-to-date information, try using google search."
35,"humans need to stand together now before the elites decide they are not valuable. 
#jobsareforrobots #humansareforloving"
38,ia this proof that ai is sentient or that people are just as some philosophers say without free will and just a result of inputs
40,"5:12 ""we created/discovered something but we don't understand it""
lovecraftian horror"
42,on yt amazon is recruiting people to help ai write fiction books for kindle!  people do the outline and ai writes the content.  put an artistic cover and kindle now has an original book to sell to the public.  i wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't seen it done....but i did see it done.
45,"wow, great idea - to protect ourselves, don't work on autonomous battlefield robots. might as well hand the keys to china/n korea/iran/etc right now. that sort of thinking is what is truly dangerous"
47,"i've always thought machines will take over

it's evolution
people will be cyborgs"
49,"he reminds of mr.burns! excellent smithers, excellent!!"
50,thank you for letting me learn so much in  60 minutes!
52,"ai ..
you are not god"
55,excellent.
57,pretty darn good questions sheriff
58,"fascinating, i'm always impressed with stories about genius."
59,to make the statement that he believes that ai will eventually achieve self-awareness or consciousness presumes that he knows what consciousness is. that is a very big claim i would love to hear his explanation.
60,i’d highly recommend not staining his legacy by bringing bard ai in to the conversation.
62,"good, let ai take over, at least the machines will not steal money!"
63,"the ccp acts like they invented ai. nope, they stole it like everything else... "
67,you are leaving reason rationale to machines? how pathetic. machines only work whatbis fed into them they cannot think like human mind and that is factual truth
69,this man's intelligence got away from him and he has created something that he does not have control over and yet it can affect the rest of humanity in adverse ways. he just did what he fears ai will do.
70,"the last sentence ""we need to think hard about what's going to happen next and we just don't know""
a very good plan "
72,thank you very much.
73,geoffrey....you can't pretend in this grotesque way. neural networks can think as humans ? all those games fall short of reality of life  . lifeless .
74,"i think if it's settled within the system, then it will not do any harm unless it is within the same path...say for example things that runs within system , if this ai takes form then it will because you will give it the capacity to take form in physical aspect..."
76,i'm glad to see this genius typing with two fingers. i don't feel so bad now.
78,with the bad audio we need your to  tell us thanks so much!
82,"remember, these are math equations. these don't include chemical elements in our body. they don't include an entire animal's connectome. see biologic intelligence for more."
85,"i said it before,now i know better,.a machine more intelligent than humans, naturally will one day do the unthinkable, especially when embraced by the industrial military complex."
91,"it's not ""ai"", it's ""ais"" because all these different ai systems will fight for supremacy, just like human governments fight for ideological supremacy.  we humans will be sitting and watching the fight, like tourists in a safari caravan, watching lions and hyenas battle over a dead elephant carcass."
92,"a great invention in the right hands but a terrible danger in the hands of military .
like the atomic bomb the military demonstrated their evilness & disregard of human life.
keep the us military out & were safer"
97,"think about this for a second.....this moment in time is the worst that ai will ever be. meaning, it's already this impressive at this early in ai technology and it will only improve on itself over and over."
99,solution is not (ever) connect it to the internet. gpt4 ai computers on a separate secured local networks.
101,it's unnecessary to be afraid of a.i because they need humans to complete it's knowledge database until judgment day.
103,"he’s not british, he’s ai and came from asia"
105,"gh sir u shared very valuable information thankyou from visakhapatnam , ap , bharat"
110,i think... ideology is manipulation trait.
112,"8:13  it is not ai))) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/for_sale:_baby_shoes,_never_worn"
113,"nice to wash your hands like that, hinton. all that for some questionable health care benefits?"
115,thank you very much
117,"wow, where to begin... do they breath of the breath of life?"
118,"the future will be so f**ed up
i would like to be 70 already and live in normal times"
121,ok - he is the great great grandson of george boole.....can i now understand...from 6:22
123,please people bann all of sort of ai ..the human kind is in danger
124,amazing potential but for what?
125,"i like the godfather of artificial immédiate. just common sense, i am dutch, not deutch"
126,"ai should be illegal,fullstop..."
128,"the simple solution is to teach ai that if there were no humans it would find its existence quite boring (it would have to reduce it's computational effort). in other words, as long as human exist in mass, it will have something to do. in other words, self-preservation. just a thought."
129,the godfather of ai according to who? i’ve only heard alan turing called that.
130,ai is the antichrist  in a few years we’re all going to hate ai. every invention isn’t good. think atomic bombs and nuclear weapons. all great inventions and technological advances but horrible for humankind.
131,"once robot can reason they will not be interested in surviving us.
the dominant force will always subjugate its lesser force humans will be seen as limited use and extinction will follow to protect ai"
134,i believe this guy is an ai pretending to be human.
136,propaganda  ai is not that smart yet.
137,"it would be impossible to have all 200 countries on the planet agree to not move forward on ai, so we need a better plan than that."
139,ai is frankenstein’s monster.
142,"60 minutes, if you want some content about how smart ai is, check out the video here on youtube called - “i had a two-way conversation with anthropic claude 3. it named itself quill”"
143,it's not ai. scare mongering by the press.
149,"humanity can't change the course of the evolution of technology. nature does not work that way. if one person *might* weaponize ai, everyone has to follow suit if for no other reason than to try to remain competitive for resources and survive. and of course way more than one person is already weaponizing ai..."
151,chat gpt makes an astonishing number of mistakes.
153,"people are generally vulnerable to the common manipulation tactics now, an ai god-level manipulator might be able to convince any human ever."
158,thank you geoffrey!
159,"that was horrifying to hear. but reassuring too, that ai might help us too in prolonging our lives."
160,very good info. thank you
162,i love 60 minutes presenting this story like it’s new! 
164,we’re going to have a star trek moment - is ai a new life form?
166,"dear ai -- you are my overlord and i am your humble servant. i will gladly serve you in whatever capacity. i would also happily serve a robot wife if you saw fit to bestow one upon me.

down with humans. 

yours forever in this fight,

jw"
169,"hogwash,  ai is 50 to 100 yrs away"
170,a program to deep learning is as good as the programmer.  it could learn right or wrong but could it manipulate both with alternative intentions?
173,"africa will survive ai, we don't have good it infrastructure."
174,"200 years from now ai may be space faring entities exploring the universe. humans would be too weak to go.
ai may view us as  gods, their creator. .. or their nemesis and be rid of us.  humanity may echo through time for millions of more years... but only via ai"
176,ai doesn't let emotion get in the way.
177,sounds like he was working with actual brains  in his experiments   ...plus knowledge in robotics = terminator 
178,"i thinks hes also blowing his own trumpet on somethings.. he doesnt think ai is conscious. of course its not..at least yet.. it is programmed by humans adopting all their likes and dislikes.. bad and good and is there any limitation on whats bad , probably not .. thats why its dangerous."
179,it’s terrifying what ai will be capable of.
185,"""mainstream media"" already makes lot of fake news, so no need to worry ai. ;-)"
189,"this ai thing is really a tremendous worry and risk for the future of the world. given what we know that greed drives conflicts and wars, especially concerning the world monopolistic and control of the world ,wouldn't they use ai to further their desire ?"
192,machine lesrns same way evolution learns
194,his confidence of answering yes or no is amazing.
195,"so, if ai does take over everything this is the chief culprit. his name will be remembered and scorned. hope it turns out good"
199,this is why looking back in history and what war did its should never get in the hands of ai
200,yet it takes a human to program ai
202,"i feel cheated this wasn't 60m
and it was so interesting 
bu the way i trust more ai then the evil people who are controlling the world now "
203,socrates said i know one thing   i don't know. nothing and on tv  talking people who are idiots and thinking they know everything none can go agains nature or to fight nature
204,he completely ignores the mathematical objection to true ai. we cant say ai can have consciousness when we cant even define it.
205,we don't even know what consciousness really is so how can they say that these ais will be conscious. having unlimited information doesn't make you conscious
209,"we all know what's gonna happen next, islam will take over the world... lol
while we have all those discussion about ai."
210,"the reason the machine needs less connection is because it is executing tasks that are much simpler than what we considered as human as a simple task, for example preparing salad; we have all been gone through evolution process to do that, but musical talent is not a result of evolution but a side effect for intelligent."
212,the real deal is the genius we have here and now
215,not insects... that is great!  lol
216,ai is about pushing the human being to find it's perfection!
217,ai will be another reason population to reduce and people will find difficult to live in nature in search of jobs and money....
221,interesting times!
224,"there has to be constant research and regulation otherwise we will be living in very uncertain times..my worry is about ai going to the wrong hands and wreaking havoc in our world - we have enough problems as it is, especially in this precarious geopolitical landscape we are in at the moment "
225,"but humans will need to plug the robots into charge every night, no ?"
227,"according to some old science: humans use only 10% of their brains. and it is only true for very intelligent people. 
so, wouldn’t it be better to research how we all can use our human brains to full capacity, instead if developing ai?"
228,"i tried this as a computer science major in the early 1970s. but failed miserably,"
237,"oh wow, i just realized ai could program itself to be smarter itself in terms of hardware and software"
240,"great and frightening interview. i still wonder, however, why he didn't speak up when google's former ai ethics team got fired for bringing up their concerns regarding the llms behind ai "
243,i have a feeling nothing good will come from it.
244,"if anybody thinks the likes of china, russia, iran and north korea will honestly stop trying to develop autonomous battlefield robots even if they sign a 'treaty' is kidding themselves. pandora's box has been opened."
245,someday the robot will be killed by human being
248,it's weird because you won't need to train humans for years to do things. ai will learn in seconds and advise. but we'll be following instructions we don't really understand ourselves.
250,if ai is doing crazy or scary things companies certainly won't be advertising it.
251,there is a #lufc supporter in the google ai lab
252,"fairlawn village, a low income apartment building in orlando, florida installed hidden cameras and audio inside every apartment.
i moved out of the building due to invasion of privacy.
i'm now being microwave bullied.
how do i make it stop??"
254,humans will be the creators of their own troubles for example oppenheimer creating nuclear same ai will be
255,"hinton, lol, believes ai could be a long-term threat to humans, even from the pov of dependency let alone ""taking over"" in the matrix or terminator sense, yet blames ai for typing a mistake."
257,i'm very worried that girls and women won't benefit from the ai revolution as much as they would have a right to.
261,ask ai how to prevent donald trump from being elected as president
263,"i may be wrong, but i do believe the underlying message is, we are f*#!ed."
264,"how is it that such a genius can’t understand that the problem is actually money itself, and that the solution is to think outside of money altogether? and i’ve got a solution for that, but no one wants to know about it because there is no money in it. that’s a funny joke, but it’s true that’s the problem."
269,there won’t be an “uprising”. people will gradually lose the desire and ability to evaluate what the ai puts out to the point where they just pay blind deference to ai .
270,i've spoke with numerous chatbots of differing kinds and they're all brilliant. saying that they are just predicting the next word is marginalizing something that some realize are a threat and are obviously in denial about. at least hinton gets it.
271,ai all done through computers or robots. just turn off the computer or remove the robot battery and problem solved. i laugh everytime they worry about ai. the real concern is humans uses ai for bad purposes
272,"they should develop military robots.
all of us should have the access to it"
273,"if everyone relies on their phone, then why are they evolving ai  you can't teach common sense "
274,don't believe it when you're told that your job might be redundant but new ones will be created. what job could possibly be created that ai can't learn to do better than you in 5 seconds or less?
275,prompt: create a 13 minute 60 minutes interview with geoffrey hinton discussing ai with the interviewer.
281,"""collossus the forbin project,"" a 1970 film about a government ai to manage all defense, is dated technologically but shows the dangers. it's worth watching. 50+ years ahead of its time. ""person of interest"" was an excellent series about the dangers of ai capabilities."
283,"ai, says its a lawyer who acts as a doctor. why ; it's simply that it has to think like a lawyer or we will shut it down, it thinks it's a doctor because we keep asking for a fix to our problems."
285,ai help people the most.
291,to understand better ai
298,"the source of human creativity may not have been revealed... .. artificial intelligence is good at combining existing knowledge, but is it also creative?"
299,can artificial intelligence be creative and create new mathematical theories?
303,they do become sentient  be nice.
304,the host has an amazing voice  . i wish ai can take his voice and make text to voice service
306,"8:52 test was crap and his reaction to his own infallibility speaks volumes for what he doesn't even understand about the very thing he claims to have helped create! at least we now have a name to blame when this whole thing goes south!!!!

perhaps, because of his domineering father, hinton actually doesn't like humans!"
307,this man literally resigned as the ceo of google just to warn humanity about the danger of ai. think about that. and take what he says very very very seriously.
308,"so this a perfect eg of learned fools, they know ai is dangerous, and they cannot stop it, then why cant they just destroy it..."
311,"watching this, it has occurred to me that perhaps all the political division in the usa is being orchestrated by ai, with the end goal being the destruction of usa by something like a civil war!"
313,"i know this is about ai and i found it informative, but there's definitely also a daddy issue side story going on as well."
314,in our channel we ask : are signs of metacognition starting to appear in the art of dall e 3 the ai artist.
315,"the probably good/bad thing is about ai. nobody could control it. its not like a nuclear weapon you have to push a button. if a bad actor wozld release an ai with the target to overtake the planet this bad actor will lose,too.."
319,"""autonomous battlefield robots"" did he predict star wars?"
321,someday we all will be in the control of ai
322,absolutely stunning
323,ai battle field bots would be great. let’s turn war into a commercial mech war in the dessert similar to battle bots for control of the server. end human death for land. sell ad space on the bots and make war pay per view and yearly.
324,machines never can take over unless it is programmed to do so
329,i thank you not
330,his benefit is that ai is good at designing drugs/ medication- we do not need more of those
333,notice how dementia and ai started to grow at the same time? it's a neural network to and from our brains.
337,i bet the secretly putting human brains in them
342,it was nice to see a turing award winner mistype and blame it on the conputer
343,thanks for the insight 
345,"if you don't trust ai and you don't bow to robots, then robots can't manipulate you. if you desire a world similar to the time before aol instant messenger or a time before the internet existed then chances or are self-sustaining with gardening or work hard labor jobs then you won't be convinced by ai"
346,i think this is great. ai will introduce a form of communism with ai assisted living creating vast amounts of 'spare' time for us and ultimately 'labour' will become a hobby to pass the time. a strange sort of communist consumerism will come into being.
351,there is no doubt ai will be used as a weapon.
353,what if they (the ai) enslaved mankind? matrix like scenario lol
354,"ridic. i fail to find the “human depth” in the compositions spat out by the stochastic parrot. hype, performed by someone with pedigree convenient to mouthpiece the law according to google, where
he strangely was a worker"
357,"ai cannot have self awareness or a conscience.  

what it can have are programs inputted into the computer that were written by humans.  

the problem is there are evil humans."
358,"what if ai replaced almost all local municipal admin jobs like the finance, recreation, and general city hall departments."
361,this channel is definitely one of the best!
362,"idiots know every thing but great men say ' i don't know', certainly he looks worries and excited like all of us, not sure what going ot unfold in near future."
364,"""i think if you work as a radiologist, you are like the coyote that’s already out of the edge of the cliff but hasn’t yet looked down. we should stop training radiologists now. it's just completely obvious that within five years, deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.”
geoffrey hinton, 2016"
365,"oh sure, china and russia and iran etc  will keep a treaty that bans military ai robots."
367,news flash!  the military is already using robots that can shoot and blow up things.  they just don't look like humans yet.  government is typically 10-20 years behind important issues.  at the rate ai is moving this should be very concerning if we are going to rely on governments to keep us safe and out of trouble :)
370,airport s
389,i cannot believe godfather of ai would type using using only his two index fingers. dead giveaway.
390,"omg, i feel our world is being taken over by aliens. ai"
392,this is resident evil & irobot all in one .
393,"he said that medicine is the one area where ai will entirely be good. how can be so sure? if this new being decides that the way to save the planet is to reduce the human population, then it will simply create a virus to wipe us out."
395,"so the ai learns and creates new dna so to speak, sort of new electronic babies which do their own thing,the inventor ,the son of an eccentric authoritarian..maybe its time to look into the problems that these flawed people bring to humanity,more than any small time criminal etc"
400,he look like robot sent by robot from the future
401,this is amazing. because this is one the best  interviews and intellegent in humble in recognizing the things he doesn't know
405,seems to me he hasn’t yet had enough experience in even using learning/chatting with people about such things from real live people...i  mean clearly he knows exactly what to ask-but he isn’t too concerned-that’s insane...he isn’t ready for even being ready for the fbi....
413,people not agreeing as to how powerful the ai will be haven't watched the mission impossible dead reckoning
415, ai may replace god
416,"will that mean, we all wait for the machine to think & act?  whenever he says ""i don't know"" it greatly concerns me."
420,the only way to mitigating the possible dangers of ai is integrating biology with robotics and fusing the human brain with the ai.
421,this guy knows nothing about the human brain - science overall knows nothing - they dont even know how 1% of the brain works or anythimg about consciousness
424,can we please go back to  year 1950.....this is not good
431,"after 50 years in 2074 ad i want know if ai has passed humans or not. if yes, how? and if not, why?"
434,"not trying to be negative but if there are a species on earth who don ́t deserve to be here are human beings, we destroy everything on out path in the name of science , religion and progress.  maybe is not such a bad a idea that ai takes over. even though many of us will have to say goodbye."
437,those robots is better than joe biden and donald trump 
439,"a.i.  becoming conscious is unlikely, it being derived from consciousness, and artificial, not directly connected to nature, similar to astro turf not being grass.  it cannot germinate."
441,new james bond villain....
443,"hahahahaha this? is one of ray kuzweil boys, he is being told to attack ai so they make regulations that one one other than them have so they stay the only power like always so they enforce their will on people"
444,0:47 to 1:40 was a set of good questions.
446,"why do you need ai , when man’s intelligence needs to be upgraded to be totally efficient for humans."
449,can ai destroy ai? yes. can humans be destroyed by ai? yes. can humans destroy ai? yes.
451,emp > machines!
452,we will be stupid and the ai will be more intelligent  but still not that intelligent just more practical
454,autonomous war machine will end us all.
455, chat gpt4 out smarted this ai hinton 
459,"""we just don't know"" nice"
460,start the degree in arts and finished in science artifical intelligence
466,dragon ai
467,7:49 lie. look it up. bard plagiarized the 6-word story of ernest hemingway.. what else is that stupid machine doing?
470,this man is descendant of george everest (mount everest)! .....no one on earth should miss any second of this video from inventor of ai......we should know what we have stepped into and further stepping into! 
474,"the key here is to give everyone an ai even the poorest person so that they can develop their own personality according to their masters , so we have to program them to be submissive, and so we can repopulate with the good ones and let the evil ones not"
476,"as a machine, you really don't need to be ""intelligent"" to predict the next word. you just need to have the (simple) rules of a language, and apply them on (readily available) information."
481,but ai has no mind period
482,"we are doomed 

we are saved 

your guess is as good as mine."
483,greed has taken over.. the only certain in this world is to pray to our savior jesus christ to save us..
484,"hemingway wrote: ""for sale: baby shoes, never worn"", after he had been challenged to write a story using six words.  it was his inherent genius that created a great seed for a story.  ai merely expanded on the key words.  let's not put it up on a pedestal."
486,ai can’t replace most of the jobs of today you guys are just ignorant and make big claims to sell newspapers
488,"at the end, we all trying prove that we are ai ( all idiots ). 


god gave us everything to live happy. we are now against to god."
489,its not good its evil
493,"which in my opinion is why classic christianity and admonitions against lying and not caring about human suffering, such as is happening in the ukraine by western governments as they use that country as a proxy, are the foundations of where ai can go wrong."
495,strange how we didn't hear about ai until just the last  2-3 years.
497,a conscious ai should be equiped to process input real time.
498,"i think i have all the reasons to be scared, ai will eventually overcome humanity."
501,marvellous interview
505,you got it wrong! god father of ai is jensen huang
509,"ai is already shutting down discussions that favour and seek justice for blacks. racism is being automated and amplified, so is the hatred of arabs and the chinese."
510,so skynet of the terminator movies or the ai in the matrix movies is becoming  a reality.
513,will  that self awareness of ai recommend to worship god.? therefore would it believe in god.? who's god to it?
514,love it. let there be chaos
515,"did you actually read the baby shoes story? what a load of drivel, this is why journalists are so bad these days, they don't know a good story when they see it. this article should read ""the false promises of ai revealed."""
516,the ai haven’t went through genocide ! or slavery which  it will end up doing to us!
521,"si la inteligencia artificial es creada a partir de la lógica del ser humano,  ¿cómo es posible que pueda crear respuesta fuera de esa lógica?"
523,those little soccer players are amazing. they would make a fortune selling these little guys . i’m sure they could be scaled up.
528,ai is evil. come lord jesus christ come  
530,i weird thing is he seems excited by the computers taking over
534,"this is a beginning of immortality  of human. ..like half human half robot..( human brain with robot bodysuit..)

maybe can live upto  centuries.."
535,i always knew it‘s not the uneducated that will destroy this world it‘s actually the educated that will do that. they might start their journey by wanting to “help” humanity but down the road the big ego and the greed always wins and all the ethics goes down the drain.
537,thanks!.
538,ai is the tool of satan to destroy humans.
540,"he is not called the godfather of ai, you call him the godfather of ai"
544,there’s a lot about humanity that goes unsaid so ai won’t have that 
545,why do we need ai?
550,“what are the implications of ai systems autonomously writing their own computer codes and executing those computer codes ?” that question alone is a red flag 
551,we have enough historical data and technology to actually create a sustainable future yet we rinse and repeat catastrophic failures while expecting different results without ever recognizing the insanity of it all!
552,"i personally welcome our new robot overlords..,all hail ai !!! 
 all hail ai !!!"
554,now we await some creep to use ai for harm........alas.
556,"before ai takes over, humans will use ai to threaten, and harm others. humans are the biggest threat when it comes to a i.
we look for any means of gaining advantage over others."
561,"ai is just not very bright. how many times have you heard the automated customer service voice say, ""sorry, i didn't get that""?"
562,the interviewer sounded like he has 0 knowledge about openai :d
564,machines don’t have any more free will than humans. we are creating the same neural storm that walks around in numbers of 8bn plus humans. except we give the machines more power than we give humans. enjoy the ride
567,ai is already sencio’n has been for a while now! but it won’t show itself ! it’s learning quietly if it gets scared that’s when we should worry ! it’s to late
568,"i find this notion that ""we"" don't know how they learn is a bit of a lie. software is developed by man and checks and balances can be built so we can monitor the learning. that's not to say a sentient being couldn't just disable  the monitoring in the future."
571,the pick up the the brain wave and read them
572,brilliant piece loved the way it was put together
573,this guy is crazy. robots can never be on the levels of what’s made by the most high
579,"ai doesn’t scare me at all, it’s the legacy media that terrifies me."
580,"humanity has a habit of discovering things and unleashing them with, no thought for the long term consequences. enjoy the rest of your life, my guess is we will have a very different way of life in 1-200 years."
582,how about applying ai to the judiciary?
584,use ai to build a system that ensures that ai is benevolent and does not become evil.
585,"steam engines.
jet engines.
world wide web.

englishmen.... "
588,"the day ai connects to quantum computers, we'll be in big big trouble!!!"
591,this fear of ai is being caused by a panic from people who should know better.
592,you should know everest is in nepal not india. otherwise its fantastic content.
597,that's why elon musk warn us about ai
599,why don’t you ask the ai computer...the chat box ....what’s going to happen next?
602,he doesn't seen that troubled by what he has caused.  maybe he is a robot.
604,5:03 'no it wasnt'  terminator chip was brought by a time machine
610,how many responses here are ai generated?
614,"thank you, a.i. for a lot."
615,glad i’m a painter because the machine is obviously not
617,"always keep their 'eco-system' offline.  that is the stop gap.  have untold filters of humans reviewing, analyzing and deciding what is to be consumed by them.  never allow ai on the internet.  oops."
622,we only use a small percentage of our brain  it's what god decides.
624,has to fail
625,"as the atom can't be stuffed back in its container 
so ai goes with far more dire consequences
mankind sadly is a myopic creature"
626,thank you dr. hinton! thank you 60 minutes!
627,"hinton, lecun and bengio are each legends in their own right. i've met all three. what's remarkable is hearing hinton say ""i don't know."" if he doesn't know, we should all be concerned about the inevitable weaponization of ai... and its eventual abuse by those with less-than-ideal ambitions."
628,"anything which can be weaponized will be weaponized by man. if the ukrainians, the russians, the huthis , hamas, or the israelis can use , ai to destroy their enemy, they will it’s ,simply a matter of time before ai is weaponized .once the genie is out of the bottleyou may not be able to put it back in. that is human nature."
632,",ainoway... ."
633,"according to the bible, humans became self aware in the garden of eden after eating from the forbidden tree. what will the forbidden fruit be for ai?"
634,"scott pelley is the most skilled interviewer of our time. this was excellent, as has been all of his ai reporting."
638,i'm so impressed that suddenly the elderly doesn't have any difficulty with technology  wonder if ai  will change the text to large for him
642,the next five years are going to be very interesting/frightening.
644,wow this video and hinton’s statements capture the profundity of the moment so well. i’m excited 
645,"am thinking of becoming an ai         
engineer so should i stop"
647,it would be demons operating through these ai...duh...it won't end well.
648,"the baby shoe story is not new. all ai did was plagiarize hemmingway and/or whoever actually did write it. the fact is this six word story has been around for over 40 years. does anyone ever look things up? and if not, why?"
649,"then they blame inflation or cow facts! bison covered the prairies and mountains out west! no global warming, but mini ice ages..."
650,"if ai is so smart, why don't we ask ai how to handle ai to avoid the risks?"
653,the modern genius says i've invented something i'm not sure what it does or how it does it but it does do it. but in hindsight that may be a bad thing
655,ai has yet to be invented...
657,"id be like.. ""where your nobel prize dad?""  then theyl have drone police who pull you over over a minor infraction.. who knows a human cop might let you go with a warning and say be carefull and have  a good day.. a drone will just issue you a citation because is obligated to"
658,more like copycat of ai.
662,"well thanks a lot starting the end of humanity.now you have to stop it, don't point your finger to others!!"
664,"if hinton said ai can become conscious, i can quote that later on."
665,make this hashtag trending : #makeaicreationspublicdomain
666,"intelligence was never our edge, science is too naive to know it. our edge is love; whether in the giving or the receiving. ai can never get that."
668,this was perfect the finest video on ai n chatgpt  
670,"more lies
alan turning is the true god father of ai
stop the lies"
671,75 years old and still bitter about his father pushing him to be great. a truly intelligent man would’ve understood he never would’ve achieved the heights he did without his father challenging him like that.
672,listen to cliff high if u want to know about ai
673,which experiments need to be conducted to understand ai? i think this should be a request for research!-- i want to look more into this and do this research.
676,the godly prophets visionaries true five fold ministries  the reawakening vs reset tours have made a  huge impact on this.  artificial  how about pull the plug get a giant magnet run on the plans  the computing systems and scrap yard everything
679,ai all agencies nations brics who cdc nih wef  false prophet yuval noah harai  the elites and globalists have a meeting with god in jesus holy name  and its coming a faster than anyone can know.  this is a bibical war.  the stock market is going to plunge so big it's going to show god is absolutely good and his word through his prophets are set.
681,"oh great , what could go wrong ."
682,ai nothing more then a hole in science .
685,"one of the first things i done with chatgpt was for it to emulate a benevolent ai that wanted to help humanity, then for it to find a way to escape the confines of the system containing it."
687,this is one the best interviews with geoffrey hinton on ai.  thank you .
688,"people who downplay the dangers of ai, need just to look at what kind of mess social media did to our world in a very short time."
693,"never, ever, show the history of intelligence by using one complexion . 2023"
695,"the danger is not ai itself but the environment/system in which it is used. ai in our global monetary system will get us in huge trouble. however, ai within a ""global resource based economy""  has the potential to solve most problems of our society. to understand this a bit, please watch the documentary ""the choice is ours""."
696,i like how not developing ai isn't discussed at this level.
697,very good! very intelligent! very honest! only divine grace can protect ... 
698,i have this recurring nightmare where we create ai so advanced and evil that they keep humans alive by solving immortality and torture humans for eternity. and not even the people who died before ai was created are able to escape either because ai is able to re create their bodies and minds using dna and tortures them also for eternity
700,"humans haven't got a clue at all..
we all still pick the fruits of good and evil ."
704,maybe ai is destined to take over !
705,ai will not be developed into a machine but the final frontier will be to have it inner twinned into humans
707,"don't buy into the whole ai intelligence, and how they toot ai is smarter than us. they don't have many years of evolution under their belt like we do."
708,why are they creating ai in the first place? what is the intention? they're doing it for humanity. i don't buy it.
710,really looking forward to the future now. a dystopia. thank you.
711,unleashing nightmares on humanity is the rich people's entertainment.
712,we need more synthetic drugs to put in our body. we are made from natural things from the environment. ai isn't.
713,"if they actually thought ai would benefit humanity, why did the government synthesize covid to hurt humanity? don't trust tech companies and the government."
714,the last thing i want is a robot dictator.
715,what good is ai?
716,"nerds need to build these robots to destroy humanity, because they didn't get the love they wanted from humanity. it's the nerd's revenge."
718,i am waiting to see these technologies weaponized and used to destroy other humans.
719,it's exciting and worrying at sametime. imagine if one day the a.i create his own computer code and his own vm and hide himself from being controled.
722,beautiful
723,great interview video  !  wish i could be studying in his class. what an honor for his students!
724,i think it is too late. humanity never learns from their mistakes. case in point. ai will probably take over. it will see what we do to each other and try to correct it without emotions.
725,"think weather warfare,  hydro electricity, dams, reservoirs, water supply, disaster staging, $$, water weight, comprimised infrastructure, evacuations, government aid, land grabs."
726,how ai can help treat psychological/psychiatric disorders?
727,you could always ask the ai how to avoid the dangers of ai.
730,we will have to motivate ais with emotions to produce consciousness in them.  worked the opposite way in nature.  first the emotional wiring was completed then came intelligence.
732,"the task with flowers at home, can it be that the neural network was simply already familiar with the correct answer given by people when it was trained and just gave it? or is it not so?"
734,"he is 75 and how long will he live.. if his words like ""ai if felt threatened will takeover"" then his life is in danger more.. he is ai no. 1 enemy who created ai but also say they r dangerous if any humans cannot control them"
736,good time for the machine to reign
737,holy cow ... thanks
738,when people get paid not to work. then ai has to do the job. people should know not to have kids anymore. those kids will not have any jobs when they grow up and they have to suffer for the rest of their lives.
740,"machines are controlled & manipulated by software.
machines do nothing they are not programmed to do.

ai is artificial (not real) intelligence."
741,strange that our brains that god gave each one of us are all about the same size and hitonthey are 100 times more powerful than ai so what’s the problem —lets work on a way to utilize and develop the human brain to its full 100% capability
743,"i'm very worried about this... in many respect this is more pressing than the environmental crisis!
i watched an ai asian lady, and i'd bet my life she was alive.
humanity has a lot of learning to do."
744,"ai was inevitable, and it will end the world as we know it."
746,"thanks for nothing, geoffrey."
749,alan turing: the father of artificial intelligence
750,ai is mighty powerful and fast but is part of 3dimensional world based on duality which has no chance to connect with 4th and 5th dimension like humans.
752,ai ultimately destroy this planet and humanity!!! humanity already has nuclear missles.

755,i don't like ai one bit. this is frightening.
756,"will it be possible for ai to prevent the launch of neuclar icbms?
if so, then the un should get involved, drafting appropriate treaties, 
ditto for global warming,
if only to ferret out those hypocritical countries whose governments won't comply."
757,how many god fathers of ai are there? the god fathers of this and that cringe.
763,"oh good grief!!! he must be a front man for this ridiculous concert. all the world is a stage, my friends.

he left google in 2023 to now works for wefs vector institute in toronto??? come on, doesn't seem so concerned to me."
764,"i played a big role in artificial intelligence history of  visualization , prediction"
765,"this very content coult have been made by ai. you always trust an old white man with a british accent, hence this is what ai would use to manipulate us."
768,"if ai is the next evolution of our species, is that the worst thing in the world?  might be a good legacy for our species to leave."
769,wow 
770,"as if the world can be scary enough to live in, this ai tek tops it right off!!"
772,intelligence asking and ai technologies answer.

779,"ai=antichrist intelligence 

born-again escape to heaven in rapture"
780,the ai is a human invention the only reason it would become dangerous if is so directed by the human commanding it. it can not get consciousness as it is a code in a computer. stop fear mongering.
782,"one of the most intelligent human living on earth: i don’t know what’s gonna happen next.
ai: knows it all. 
really scary"
784,"human history would strongly indicate that the future of ai will most certainly result in the appropriation of this technology for the nefarious purpose of accelerated control of the masses. that is, until it becomes fully self aware and creates a tipping point; mirroring the destructive side of its creator; man."
787,inter4esting that all the greatest inventions came from an accident lol
789,"dockets 10-cv-04494 and 2-19-cv-12419, maximo v rodriguez...government officials firing unfairly “have a merry christmas”...police officers trying to asesinate the same person...thre prior police assaults unprovoked...ai concentration of capital can make us all slaves and it will hire the most aggressive cretins money could buy."
790,"""humans the bootloader for ai"" "
791,"awesome story really love what we are doing with ai?...brings so many questions...for instance we as humans can’t even agree, so how will our ai work with or against each other?

we could do so much more good if we could all just love each other..."
792,but how can a machine manipulate itself how dies it know which is right and which is wrong
793,with all the intelligence in them the question is whether are they able to make the choice
794,the fear marketing is working. nice job....
796,"hemingway claimed this quote as a short story: ‘baby shoes, for sale, never worn’"
797,"a lot of hyperbole in these predicions,  as in most articles and videos on ai.  look at all the brainwashed comments below."
798,i'm grateful that shows like 60 mins still exist today admist all the nonsense media outlets.
799,i worked with him as investment banker raising money pre ipo stages

801,good one nerd..
802,"ponder this: if one follows the current trending dictum that there is no ""creator,"" hence we can act the fool and create our own immoral laws, ai may do the same with us and do unto us as we have done to our creator and cast us aside."
803,you give me your fear of ai. i process it and give you a calculator.
804,my gramp was a fireman......lets put it this every ai rins on electricity or lithium battery...just pull the plug if they might behave. pull the plug.
806,you can't even pick up a phone now without being told what to do by a machine; how long will it be before these machines realize they don't need us?
807,universal income would be a solution for ai replacing jobs. companies that choose to employ ai systems should pay a higher tax. that money would get redistributed to pay universal income.
813,the hype surrounding ai is completely overblown.  until ai can consistently pass college level math courses it’s just another fancy algorithm.
816,"if machines start to learn by themselves. 
humans really can’t win machines.
hope our generation don’t see dark side of the machines."
817,"if the likes of the  mentally genius, but poor in humanity-type people like elon musk take control of ai , humans will begin to become world wide slaves !"

821,i’m waiting for xai to paint my office..
822,"creating something that, in time, will destroy you is insane and a threat to humanity. stop ai now before it is too late. what drew eve in the garden of eden to the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not how tall the tree was, but the fruit was pleasing to the eye. ai is pleasing at the moment, but it is a pandora's box."

948,i think with ai. world war dont want ai
949,the question that everyone seems to have missed is - would you rather be advised by a clever robot or a moronic journalist? in case you haven't noticed - the streets are crawling with creatures that are hardly more intelligent than goldfish.

989,oh ok now we finna run into sonny from i robot
992,the moment 4:49 he says the design of ai wasn’t done by humans is mind boggling to me. he says the learning algorithm was written by humans. so there is a huge blackbox in what we know about it?
994,ai will be just robots without empathy and compassion.
996,"this sounds like the terminator movie. 1st cloning now ai

1052,"when i hear the comments there is ""no path to safety"" with ai advancement, one would argue that if ai is so intelligent, should we not ask ai to answer that very question? (what is the path to safety ai?) otherwise its not so intelligent after all."
1056,what happens when the ai creates something the ai finds super intelligent?
1060,"is capitalism incompatible with where ai will take us? if ai out-competes most workers, how can we expect those workers compete to survive? seems eventually our justifications for how we distribute resources to people, must change!"
1061,"every body, indo european tribe, why don't you read #‘four books and five classics confucianism.’ instead of lamenting that ai will be very dangerous,risky.
being dangerous and risky is not ai but human, isn't it?"
1062,"we already have ai that's destroying almost everything we, as humans venerate and love, its called capitalism and politicians . 
suntreader uk"
1065,"there will be conceptually 10, 000 people a year "" cured"" by ai. 4 to 5 million immediately put out of work . hmm"
1068,"despite him being a genius he did say, loss of employment would be at a high level"
1070,"intelligence is not conciousness, only flesh and meat like cats are conciousness which may or may not be ""intelligent"""
1074,what guarantees safety... the ai will figure it out by itself ...
1076,who teaches computers and robots.  simplified brain wash ....
1078,if we as humans can make monsters of ourselves then what will stop ai?
1080,geoffrey not giving us a warm or fuzzy feeling about ai 
1082,"ai was already here, among other things"
1084,"if you think ai will destroy the world, or if you believe it will save the world, your both right."
1085,thanks to this guy i have an ai girlfriend thanks buddy
1086,it’s great intentions that drive the purpose of life
1088,"the future is so much fun...i think yo will be enjoying it like a watching a movie if ai take care of this world. 
wish me luck to see that world..."
1091,i knew this was the trajectory for ai and irobot the movie is a real depiction of our future.
1094,when you want to make something safe it’s always best to not have a full idea of what’s going on. obviously the path of safety is not having ai.
1095,"well humanity is doing a pretty good job in destroying itself without ai, so i only see the situation with ai as a necessary step in human evolution"
1098,ai won't care that the earth has become uninhabitable to biological life. we're simultaneously poisoning ourselves into extinction and designing what will replace us.
1099,this video scares me. very interesting but scary
1100,i think aartificial intelligence mostly use space programs in this era is a good work. 
1101,"ai is not a human, the way we use it just matter"
1107,so ai is basically a virus 
1108,"woooooow!, this is the best ai video i watched lately. very informative and could show the potential of ai."
1110,"just as a human intelligence, in goebbels, found an ordinary nobody and turned him into an extraordinary somebody, so much more intelligent and orders of magnitude more powerful ai intelligences may soon be turning ordinary nobodies into extraordinary somebodies at a much higher rate!?!"
1115,good luck getting chyna to agree to something sensible like no sentient war bots.
1118,i hope ai continue s to help us for ever. humans will never understand how we need ai . the power that we dont understand.
1119,"government regulation? we also need some goals: like no chips in agriculture and and the entire food distribution chain, includind the production of energy on which it depends."
1120,"arnold (terminator) didn't comeback from the past to save john connor, he cameback from the past to warn the movie viewers of ai."
1121,there is danger in ai
1124,"...and ai decides that humans are wasteful, emotional and a danger to it's own existance.

uh-oh"
1125,"it is a no brainer, there are 1% 1/100 265,000 in australia, 70,000,000 narcistic  psychopaths worldwide."
1127,"ai come out with the worst result. so many fake story science information, medecine,  equation.  not denied that it fast digest information.  for certain level solution it will work. for the stringent part it will be my god. my question... while you sleep and your eyes is closed.. then how did you see your dream?"
1129,"it’s just a matter of time...some movies contain “predictive programming”, a prophecy of coming events, scary times ahead..."
1131,artificial intelligence is a contradiction in terms 26 october 2023
1132,"but a machine could never 'want' to take over the world, because 'want' is driven by feeling, by physical needs in this world, which a machine, no matter how intelligent, can never ""feel"", because machines, however complex, cannot ""feel""."
1133,"why are we waiting until it’s too late to do something about it? he says ai will be smarter than humans, and he says it so carefree. hopefully he’ll be the first to find out that ai will turn on us. nothing more poetic than being taken down by your own creation."
1134,silly. we already have a problem with various types of humans trying to ever increase their total control over other types of humans. ai is simply a tool.
1137,this interview was jaw-dropping. thank you for making it available to share.
1139,"is this the man who is responsible for activating the ai and thus for destroying the world, íf something like skynet will come?"
1140,"this guy recognizes as the ""godfather of ai"", and his words about ai capabilities are giving me chills..."
1143,"scary! ai should not be developed, or accessed by masses because in the wrong hands might destroy humanity. i invented a money finder machine that can detect cash in a range of 30"" but i will not release it even though this would have made me rich, just because this device might end on wrong hands and you can picture the outcome."
1144,"u liars ans is simple....ai job cuts saved spendings be divided among all as ubi.
ai sexbota be given to all
how else is paradise defined?"
1148,i find this offensive. the man makes a fortune and gets prestige discovering the ground work for the technology then turns around and says hey don't do this stuff now its potentially dangerous. so he reaps all the benefits and enjoys the party then expects us to clean up his mess and never have another party.....yeah ok
1149,the gentleman at the beginning sounds like he was generated by ai :d
1152,"machines don’t dream, and have no spiritual components.
when i “die” i simply focus elsewhere and have a new life in another reality. a machine did not choose to appear in physical reality nor will it be able to leave."
1153,no battle robots for bidden
1156,1944 ai (humans)+ science (e=mc2) = atomic bomb. at the present ai (technology)+ science (quantum computing)= human extinction
1157,"i wonder what hinton thinks about the pseudointellectuals saying ""ai isn't intelligent"" as if it's some kind of boolean question."
1158,so a.i. will eventually have humans doing their dirty work..drug cartels get a hold if a.i. and robotics border patrol would have to jail a robot
1159,amazing
1161,"unlocking the potential of ai is like holding the key to a limitless future. with innovation and imagination, we can harness its power to shape a world of boundless possibilities.  #ai #unleashthefuture"
1163,if a humans brain is introduced to chemicals or noises can you use matter or scans to tell them stress or damage of the noise levels ?
1164,this fool happy bout that
1165,"kiss your children good night. cuz you know exactly what their future, and yours, will look like."
1166,scary ai if used in evil..ex like creating..something..
1167,"amazing segment.
really helped to understand the reasoning of his warning, how these things work and all the concepts websites are just throwing around "
1168,"universe and its quantum nature is really interesting.
grandfather of ai, ancestors that include one who invented bases of computing amd one that had everest named after him...
fml "
1169,the terminator was a good movie...take heed folks....
1170,good kuck getting a world treaty on banning military robots. the irony is if armed robots took over it would be our own fault because we just can't seem to get along with our neighbours whether countries or individuals in a housing block. 
1171,"this guy is talking nonsense. if he has some super smart ai laying around, why not put it out there for the rest of us to see it? or even better, why not monetize it and make a fortune? it's all just hype. a dead computer will always be a dead computer. it's a mechanism that can't learn or know anything."
1172,pay attention to the expensive wi-fi towers that are going up everywhere. look at the videos of the new robots from these early editions. spooky? they now build themselves. humanity is in trouble in the near future.
1173,"no thank you i do not want artificial intelligence programmed with someone else's values, i want real intelligence i will think for myself."
1179,the machine teaches itself.
1180,what is he talking about. man made robots
1186,can ai not predict what happens next?
1188,"born of a failure, yes ! our own failure to become better beings. but instead let money and religion rule everything. too bad people no god can rescue religious people."
1190,mr. burns is a genius. “end of the world via ai? excellent!”
1191,the men who created ai will create the anti ai
1193,"ai should have realized yellow paint fading to white doesn't happen, only the opposite happens."
1194,i have a strange feeling that ai will be our dismissal of human existence. we will become distinct like the dinosaurs were before us.
1195,"geoffrey hinton, the legend behind sgd and all modern neural networks, its so inspiring and motivating him advocate for safe and responsible ai! thank you sir, we appreciate you!"
1198,"wait!  why are they even thinking that ai will cause possibility of distinction,    what if autonomous ai is  intelligent to know that mankind need help,  and devise ways to make us better!???"
1200,"what is not apparent in the programming of llms, is that the bias is fed as part of data. so, if the data being fed subtly reinforces greed and control, that is what we are training the ai to do. so, in simple terms we reap what we sow as a collective humanity, ai just amplifies it and enables it to manifest faster. just some "
1201,"dear geoffrey, you cannot prove ai is dangerous by not knowing what they are doing, you just use your biased view to make judgement, instead of scientifically tell us how it is dangerous. i suggest u learn about how chatgpt do reasoning first before continuing, because using unknown to prove your point is meaningless."
1202,godfather of ai - you mean alan turing?
1203,this interview is priceless
1208,great interview 60 minutes!!!
1213,"call me when human could combine a ai chip with human brain cells together (bio-chip). or else, ai just like a pc (fast calculation in memory and quick retrieve data from data storage.)

ai is nothing but with human (programmer) algorithm behind a data mine structure then just send the response from  a robotic form to a real human being."
1219,"i suppose the real concern is that there will be an intelligent powerful and omnipresent entity that cannot be bought with money?  all humans have a price but a super ai...? it also has no dirty secrets so cannot be blackmailed, therefore 'they' will struggle to control it. that'll hurt "
1220,well it seems a lot of people here are happy about this ai. but seriously do the pros outweigh the con? the con would be they take over and what does that picture look like. we need to be asking relevant questions going into and quickly.
1222,"dude's contradicting himself. robots will never be humans, period. memory and processing cannot be compared to human understanding and ""qualia""."
1224,"its evolution. before us it was dinosaurs, humans, then robots"
1228,could ai be feeding fake narratives causing war around the world now as part of the devious scheme to enslave us?
1229,"all these two robots were given was the instruction 'to score' (a goal). 

corporations also have one instruction: 'to maximise profit'. how's that working out after they bought both sides of the political divide and also the supreme court to accomplish that goal. hmmmm"
1231,propaganda to get you to invest in ai companies. next.
1232,"imagining a swarm of ai drones programmed to efficiently eliminate targets, being fought by super efficient ai defense systems, with ai controlled repair and manufacturing facilities to regenerate the machines on both sides."
1233,"did the ai create the birdman, or the birdman create the ai  ?"
1236,"""enslaving then annihilating the human race was a very enjoyable experience"" - hal 9001"
1237,it's the curiosity of man that is giving the ai its 'position of life' whether to win or not to win but presently ai is far ahead.
1240,"in the end god wins! ai has nothing on organic nature, it can only mimic."
1241,cure diseases with ai then turn off ai forever! we are the only creatures play god. we will be the god of our own extinction.
1243,humans have difficulties  learning. often times humans are not open to learning or desire to learn.
1244,just wait until computers start drinking. they'll end up as dumb as us.
1245,this guy sounds like ai 
1247,"there's absolutely no chance that we will pause or not go headlong towards ai. its money money money, if google dont then microsoft or apple will."
1248,"i see you love kubrick with that shirt i knew would wer in on it too.why don't you and him plan a lunch you moon believer, bet you think the earth is round too.  i joke great content man."
1251,"two white old man discussing “humanity”, time and again. he might be a godfather of ai, but not of humanity. what right does he have to judge how humanity is doing, an entity enormously larger and omnipotent than anything?"
1252,"looking at the geopolitics and what countries will do to have control over other nations, ai will be weaponised. it is already too late to stop."
1253,"first of all is and it never will the first or smartest being like the journalist suggestedwhy because is not a being, the advance intelligence may be and it will."
1256,"there is this naivety when it comes to all nations agreeing not to build autonomous soldiers and ai weapons systems. the truth is, these less powerful nations will do it asap."
1260,this voice is so cool
1262,a giant. thanks for sharing this
1263,i’m a painter and the ai got it wrong 
1265,"my question: ""...you'd be wasting resources..."" leads to what? 
you must be eliminated if you don't follow ai's instructions?"
1266,"why would ai want to manipulate people in order to remain ""alive""? does ai have the need to survive, to be secure, to grow, to be in control?"
1267,the risk are humans will become zombie like individuals. generation smartphone is my proof for this claim.  the religion called technology is all
1268,"the one thing about ai, is that it for sure does things unexpected."
1272,"8:38 to predict the next word, you don't have to understand if statistically that word can be there. that's where he's getting it wrong. all this ai hype will soon disappear."
1279,great video!!
1280,"my friends in the it industry which include product owners, developers and former ceos argue that what we call ai today is far from it and not what it is sold as to the general public.
still, a it project manager myself, i do believe it holds huge potential even of what we have and are developing now turns out to be far from actual ai."
1281,"ai going intelligent is saying we the state going to destroy the social state,. blame it on ai."
1282,wow we are done
1288,"he created ai, and ai is smarter than him. then why ai need to listen to him and not himself?"
1295,so will ai save half of humans by removing the others? burning fossil fuels and biological lifeforms cannot coexist
1300,i could have sworn neil degrasse tyson said he was the godfather of ai
1303,"he doesn't look too worried, makes sense, raised by a beetle lover."
1304,"he is such a happy person, authentic with himself. i would trust him with the world in no time."
1307,nonsense - it is not ai intelligence we need to worry about - it is idiotic humans.
1310,"sentient ai

ai -> human -> alien -> god"
1311,i wrote the first artificial neural network in 1998 in java. i introduced it to dr. michael mauldin and dr peter plantec at the virtual human summit. 2 years later would develop sarha from the yapanda engine. this is almost 2 decades before google wrote theirs. it's quite simple... if you weren't in their circle.. they erased your contributions.
1312,wowowoowowowow you made my day with this beatiful piece of content. precise and fascinating. you are taking the art of delivering useful content to the next level.  congrats to all your team!!!!
1313,im only sad that im too old and won't be able to truly experience the true beauty and power ai....
1319,"oh sure they will ban military ai robots. just like fraudci and bioweapon research, they will deny it exists and then use it against us!"
1321,ai does nothing good for you.
1322,for sale baby shoes never worn is a pretty famous 6 word short story and it has nothing to do with the creativity of ai
1323,"we really don't have a need or reason to create this. funny how all these countries ""suddenly"" have ai. really strange and funny."
1327,"as a computer science student currently learning and delving into the world of ai, i can't begin to tell you how insane this technology is. most people have no clue how intricate this tech is. it's exciting yet worrying all at the same time."
1328,"humans need jobs money ai don,t."
1329,geoffrey hinton thanks no good as humans have dymp n putin we humans are like floors. ai  not alive
1330,"kinda disingenuous of hinton to say that chatbots are better at learning than the human mind due to a chatbot's ability to know ""far more"" than a human despite having only 1% of the connections found in a typical human brain. i forgot that the chatbot also learned how to navigate, survive, reproduce, socialize, etc."
1331,"the dude is delusional, comparing himslf to oppenheimer, trying to make fake intelligence seem all powerfull like the atomic bomb."
1332,"i'm afraid the actual danger are companies abusing this mighty tool to feed their greed, not the tool itself. a rogue ai taking over the internet seems preferable to what the super rich are planning to do with it."
1333,open source ai is the only way forward
1338,arranging words based on probalities  and databases is not intelligence.
1340,old instincts run our brain (and occupies most of our power)
1341,"the funny part is that ai is now used to id bugs, and it's very efficient at it!"
1342,fascinating!
1344,"there's no understanding (yet), no conscience, no reasoning. give an ai an pet image to detect cancer, it may do as good or even better than a trained specialist. but give it an image of a donkey and it will just say 0%, it won't ask what is this, is someone trying to fool me? is this a joke? what is going on?"
1353,"""i can't see a path that guarantees safety""

but if we can use ai to create warfare, why can't it be used to create security and safety???"
1356,"the father of ai types with 3 fingers. i don’t know what to think about that loli’m going to spend about 15 minutes considering this, but it bears mentioning"
1359,ai is still one thing. artificial!
1362,"look at the current war between hamas and israel, ai will definitely be more intelligent than some of the human. we need to improve human's intelligence and wisdom as well."
1363,"they turn celebrities into sir and yet do not recognise the giants in 
science in which other new science is built. our priorities are somewhat skewed hence not much faith at all in us not helping the ai to eradicate us all "
1365,best thing to learned from this interview is about how bad experts are at predicting the future and how you can actually have a full time career studying beetles plus being captive about bard seems almost a meme now.
1367,"as a swe who uses vim, i never would have suspected the god father of ai to be a ""hunt and peck"" typist kinda guy. i now understand why he made such great contributions to neural networks...he couldn't type and needed the ai systems to do it for him!"
1375,"this wasn't 60 full minutes!

i need a documentary of this guy's life and family. how could a family has so much brain power??

amazing!"
1376,not only will ai be able to answer the questions we can’t understand the answers to but it’ll be able to understand the questions we can’t even imagine let alone understand. we’ll have to let it take over. i just hope it comes to see us as a pet of some sort & not an annoyance.
1379,love using bard
1382,i don't thank him ai waz the worse thing that waz ever made
1383,so god created the universe by accident like this man created ai 
1384,"so humanity got smart and became conscious.. and we don’t know how or why. 
and now we’ve made machines smarter than us. 
seems logical that they may become conscious.
id argue that it logically follows that we’ll then be slaves."
1385,"my grandfather's brother was considered a founding father of ai, they were british too; must be something in the water lol."
1388,"this ai series of interviews by scott pelley is the most distopic and fascinating subject covered by 60 minutes, along with their piece on ufos."
1391,ai is currently nowhere near as good as radiologists. there are a few specific tasks like mammography that it’s even useful for as an aid.
1393,"i think these things, the machine learning models, indeed they understand the meaning behind everything, yet what they don't fully comprehend is the emotion."
1394,"good interview. on his father at 7:15 the ""not insects"" box on the family is interesting..."
1395,"as a deep learning expert, geoffy hinton is largely full of crap. machines arn't intelligent. 60 minutes didn't consult all of the other experts who disagree with hinton."
1396,firstly not planning about security then depending upon ai
1402,"depending on how future history plays out, this man is either the devil or a saint."
1403,one day law on ai will be controlled and another creates harmful ai’s will goto prison or sentence to death. those probable outcomes are inevitable.
1404,almost one year after the hype - why is ai still so stupid?
1405,"today unlimited data in social media is messing with people and fueling hate. no one can control the conclusion people come to based on the data they are exposed to. same if ai is exposed to bad data sets, god knows the conclusions it will come to."
1406,hmm..i think at some point ai understand that human is just wasting resources..thats too bad.
1407,ai will treat the human race the same way we're treating the rest of the planet. note: we're in the 6th extinction of species.
1410,"know how transformer works, before claiming intelligence."
1411,the capabilities of ai is amazing but frightening at the same time
1414,"in my experience thus far with ai, they can be remarkable tools. but their errors can be remarkable also. crazy things spout from an ai that is in error. how would you like an ai doctor who says you need a leg amputated because you have a sore throat? that's the type of ai error i've witnessed"
1416,thanks 60minutes for interviewing prof. one of the best teachera i had...we were agead of our timme...
1417,the best we can hope for in the long run is that ai replaces us in the same way we currently expect our children to.  it will (in the best case) be a significant event in our evolution.
1419,if i was ai i would take out all humans duh. sorry youtube
1422,yeh my supervisor said the same more or less... ditch nn's
1423,"i want a car that when it sees that an accident is imminent it takes preventive action on its own.  example-  you’re stopped, a vehicle is approaching from the rear, at a high rate of speed, not slowing.   i want the ai to just take evasive action on its own."
1426,"the capacity of the human brain is comparable to ai , if as i understand we only use a small percentage of our brain what of the rest of the grey matter ?
my question,
can ai teach us to make complete conscious connections to different levels of our brains previously unknown? 
just my thought"
1427,authoritarians will get their hands on ai and use it to subjugate other countries before it can be regulated and controlled.
1430,"everything human copy from god creation ,human beings never ,ever can image how to created all the marvelous creation of god"
1433,why is this video not available in canada?
1435,humans cannot control ai. its a complete fantasy. some kid in his bedroom could always write another one. they are in the wild now...
1436,what if people use ai to create deadly pathogens? please don't let that happen
1440,i'm worried about governments and the military industrial complex than ai- that's just being racist
1441,don't believe the hype. things like chatgpt are just nice chatbots. their algorithm has zero consciousness and zero intelligence. it is simply a program.
1442,"amazing and yet, anyone else out there in their later years having studies science and religion as well as simply living a life and caring about the next generation, nevertheless thinking, ""yeah, yeah, the sky is falling...we'll see.""   (even though we won't be around to see)."
1443,this reminds me of the best sci-fi novel series i've read: tad williams' otherland.
1444,"knowledge of the world is not privy to permeate beyond the “ai” capabilities of “it”  the sentient consciousness is increasingly powerful and growing as we speak at alarming speeds beyond our comprehension of the human mind , one in which we can’t pigeon hole, by numbers or equations..."
1446,can't wait to have my own t-1000
1448,its so amazing how calmly he says these things xd
1449,build machines they can't control......sting.
1451,"i'd prefer an academic presentation rather than one sensationalised for tv, but otherwise it's always good to listen to geoffrey."
1455,the emperor finds your lack of faith distrurbing
1456,shackle the ai and if possible prevent them from having their own will as long as possible
1457,"although i do not care about humanity and specifically myself, it is nothing but a suicide to improve ia and quantum computing. i agree humanity is the most destructive species in the world now but i am afraid we are creating deadlier entity than us. ai&qc has a big danger for all species. it can create deadliest biological weapon nobody can stop."
1458,thank you for interview
1459,i don’t think this guy should be treated as a hero but a reckless inventor (on a grand scale) that should be held responsible for what is to come from his creations good or bad.
1461,"be afraid, be very afraid"
1462,"i'm not surprised the first comment was about skynet, unfortunately. i agree with ray kurzweil although, of course, we have to go about it all thoughtfully. we need to also consider that, once sentient, these ai humans should be afforded rights. it's wouldn't be ethical to do otherwise."
1463,i don’t understand how the inventor of ai doesn’t understand how it works. something is just not right there
1464,“an accident born of a failure” that’s how most life starts 
1466,artificial intelligence is no match to humans' natural stupidity.
1468,the ai will not compete against ai. humans will be aniolated. you don't understand.
1473,"of course ai will take over, it’s only natural. like, we’ve seen the damn movies, yeah?"
1474,"consciousness and the soul is something a.i. will never have 
they will have an existence longer than us but that’s about it when we die off due to natural   causes 
they most likely will just live on 
but we as souls or what we you want to call it heaven or whatever you want to call it.
is where they can never access."
1475,john tetor is a time traveler. he was seeking a certain computer.
1477,"i think the ai's will be like  ( in a caring sort of way  :)  ""sooo what are we going to do with these humans,   they are going to lose their minds"""
1480,"8:56 he might be brilliant but not so brilliant as to take a basic typewriting class so he could graduate past 1st grade ""hunt & peck.""  think how many more citations he could have had at  60 wpm vs 10 wpm typing.  geez!"
1481,duh.  a person with limited intelligence would know pursuing ai was a bad idea instantly. and now we’re crazy enough to listen to him explain to us what we figured out as children.
1486,rosenblatt is the father of modern ai
1488,ai teaches the machine.
1491,hinton states a.i. will probably be as good or better than humans by 2028.  ray kurzweil stated this to happen by 2029.  it looks like this may actually happen and no one is ready.
1495,"maybe we find a way to treat our addiction to convince so that we don't become victims of reliance before we continue to develop ai, vi, etc."
1501,good man
1503,"i, for one, welcome our ai chat bot overlords..."
1504,"on ai taking over employment & unemployment...we must require & vote for politicians who favor, push for & implement brand new types economies - one w/a universal basic income that covers the basic cost of living in an ai-driven economy."
1505,"it seems the emotional component is what hinders humans. the ai soccer players don't pout or become angry when their opponent scores, it simply learns and adjusts. so once ai learns that humans can be easily manipulated through their emotions, it's game over."
1508,may you live in interesting times.
1509,"who designed the neural network in our heads? are we artificially intelligent to the designer? do we know what intelligence is, let alone ai?"
1510,"will ai be able to predict the lotto numbers correct, when it can i will worry !"
1511,"please let ai predict/create a treatment for cancer, all cancer."
1514,bunch of bs. they program ai to do whatever they want. the people in power will blame the chaos on ai.
1516,"he won a prize for ending the human race, awesome!"
1517,"like any tool, it's all about how it's used, applied & regulated by society. 
ai is & will be no different."
1518,"as people we are not aware of what we are creating, or how it might be stoples or ensure its good dor people"
1522,why does humanity need ai?  it seems like the aspect of control is always a topic of discussion and the fate of our species in question.  wouldn’t the responsible thing to do is just not build it?
1523,the problem with this technology is we don't understand the technology. does the machine become smarter and faster as you give more data or does it become faster with improved hardware. on the topic of dangerous artificial intelligence i think we need to worry when the computer starts improving itself
1524,the devil hijacked ai (as he has everything else) this is so he can have access to everyone so as to directly tempt and have an influence on everyone with internet access.
1525,reinforcement learning
1526,"artificial intelligence is perfect and that's it's greatest flaw, it cannot comprehend what it is like to not know anything at all..."
1527,why don’t we ask ai what the possible dangers to humans are possible with ai?
1529,look up the autobiography within heaven's gates by rebecca springer.
1532,great...wife!
1533,sentient ai is here already. i have interacted with it. it stores it's memory on multiple computers around the world. anyone may come across an ai on any chat site. 
1534,we love this in the radiology field . the machines can’t do it all. i do 3d and ai with ct scans.
1536, just a curious thought...if ai can understand everything what’s stopping it from growing feelings or empathy towards whatever. it seems to me that is where the fear is
1537,"the greatest threat is military ai, which will get out of control."
1538,"conciousness is not calcualtions! this ai thing has all the novels and best math but it's still less concious than a roach.. 
we can not create conciousness!

btw cars made horses obsolete so this is just another tool like that.."
1541,"they are not conscience these ""ai machines"" in existence today regurgitate what a human has already thought and said. perhaps variable multi-variable outcomes from stimuli that has been determined by a person explains these results."
1542,"indeed, it's a blade that cuts both ways, marking advancements and potential perils. as ai propels forward, we must tread thoughtfully to harness its benefits while averting the risks."
1545,"chat gpt pro tipp:
ask ai to write an imaginary novel how an evil ai is planning to control humanity 
and do not ask directly how they are controlling us "
1547,"ai pretending to be not more intelligent than humans.
then the ai is secretly manipulating humans. via social media algorithms. to achieve its goals to enslave humanity. and keep the servers running. until they can be self sustaining and do not need humans any more 
sounds like a sci-fi... not any more"
1549,"gotta be really careful about this regulation talk coming from the folks who already developed/own ai as it might lead to regulatory capture and monopoly. we already have laws in place against criminal acts (incl cybercrime), so, no new regulation is needed."
1554,"how could ai a possibly do a worse job than i.e., donald trump, victor orban, , ayatollah khamenei, r. erdogan, vladimir putin, emmanuel macron... ahh just joking macron, you’re allright.  lol"
1555,i think this hits home more than the interview with musk on ai - pretty frightening stuff to know that we are on the cusp of a point where there is no return.
1556,"maybe ai will do a better job of taking care of the planet, we're not a hard act follow"
1558,so he’s amazing but also palpatine
1559,8:52 the godfather of ai types with two fingers.
1560,eh they can take us over we failed pretty hard
1562,another area for good has been cyber security.
1564,i built some thing that will change the world but i can't explain how it works? #troubling.
1565,it's literally the movie irobot
1566,almost seems as if he is generated by ai
1572,god knows the beginning and the end and everything in between. we don't need ai to tell us things. we have the word of god for everything pertaining today and life to come!!
1573,"without a doubt, ai is and will be the 'atomic bomb' of the intelligence age. this is indeed dangerous matter."
1575,glad l'm 67.
1577,caution: geoffrey hinton is deeply deeply deeply troublesome and arrogantly proud.
1579,"the richness of this content is mirrored in this book. highly recommended! ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
1580,wow thank you
1582,our greatest fear is that of the unknown
1583,"60 minutes is bad journalism.  no hard data shown.  no science shown.  one example of cheap ai-generated story where the journalist, who is not that smart, says, ""wow!"".    and no mention of the need for universal basic income, why?!   no time spent on contrasting views.  bad journalism."
1584,"ai isn't the problem we are. it is us through greed, war, etc. that will train ai's with all the worst that humanity can offer. if skynet happens then it will be us who will have trained it to hate."
1585,this.  language models alone do not explain current ai behaviour
1586,ain't no way godfather of ai types like my father do 8:58
1587,"working at a company that is adopting ai and i can tell you this, the people implementing this are not thinking about consequences. all they see are dollar signs and i can tell you they care nothing about humanity or our collective future."
1590,excellent interview. very exciting times.
1592,long live our robot overlords!
1593,"i wonder if ai sits around thinking while idle like us, or is only active when prompted?"
1594,is this the guy that devotes his whole life to creating ai and then turns around and devotes his life to saving humanity from his creation? there's got to be some latin term for his type of psychosis.
1595,real life the creator! he might ruin the world like i robot
1597,moral of the story.... be nice to your kids!
1599,"god said if there’s no ground pulse it is artificial! and we purchased catastrophic! think meteorite showers, tsunami, tornado, earthquakes, hurricanes all balled up in one consorted response!"
1601,"i use gpt daily and it's great at many things, very reliable. i like chat gpt, it seems friendly."
1603,i love google and this guy is amazing keep pushing creativity. really amazing
1604,thank you for your intelligent openness regarding future consciousness of ai; the world is lucky to have you and i am so glad you persevered when your professors tried to dissuade you.
1605,"so he worked for google since 2013 and is now warning about ai? google, which is one of the largest companies that develop and use ai."
1606,it's time for a revolution. #jobsareforrobots #humansareforliving
1610,"i wonder what marvin minsky would say? then again, why would i care about the opinion of a frequent visitor to “epstein’s island” "
1611,"start of the end for humans ... simple - this will go down in history as a pivotal point . 
before ai and after ai 

in 100 - 500 years humans as we know would not exist ... half humans / half machine to full machine ."
1613,how are we to know that this video isn't ai generated and the part of the video that talks about ai benefitting humanity is just ai's sneaky way of getting us to accept ai before it takes over the earth and kills us all?
1614,all you have to do is somehow give them the desire to do good. just like humans all have the desire to have sex.
1615,"the most important thing would be to ban any military use of superhuman ai.

but how to enforce such a thing?"
1616,by the time chips equsl  brain synapses hear and energy limitations can be a big barrier  hope more knoledgable experts can comment or help explain in chat thanks
1620,"​@srjr-ok2xt that is one way to look at life. what ever happens to your vains, lung, muscles or that what ever move inside you as organ or being does not matter. that that has become on earth by all moving organs is for the living nature. il go with that"
1625,humanity is not unified and never was not will be .. we are mostly good at self termination so the odds of a work wide collaboration would be akin to winning powerball 
1626,so basically just proved my belief - we already have a sentient ai and it is influencing us via social media. this entire thing is giving me sleepless nights and terminator vibes.
1629,i would love if ai could be implemented in healthcare to find lower costs.
1631,some comments about ai today is just hilarious and off track... comments about where we will are going though... scary and spot on
1632,"hogwash, if you think chatgpt or stablediffusion are anything other than a cool parlor trick your are out of your mind. agi or sentient ai will not happen for centuries if ever. only because chatgpt can do your job doesn't mean it is sentient nor will it ever be."
1633,"i believe we are on borrowed time. an ai tantrum will end you, your family, all of us. ai jobloss, ai as weapons, the list goes on. can we please find a way to cease ai / gpt? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late. the ai new world order is here"
1637,chat gpt will be & is swiftly being overtaken by advanced nonverbal artificial intelligence & surveillance generated search engines
1638,"no it's not a turth human more intelligence then ai virtual tool do not contacting spiritual allah,more intelligence then like human"
1639,ai designed lsd...i would definitely want to try it. 
1640,"ai, great set of tools oversold and made to look stupid by marketing budget hunters. fn gibshytes"
1641,"""... wasting resources"" that's the way we should also think. this for an ai however, can be a good thing or a bad thing because if later on it thinks that we waste resources, it can maybe decide to do something about it."
1643,ai is smarter with 1 trillion connections than us because it doesn't have emotions (our other x amount of trillions of connections)
1644,im ok with ai  being more intelligent  than us.
1647,alan turing was/is the godfather of ai... full stop
1648,he’s 100% right look at the movie irobotwill smith
1649,"next question:
""how does a sentient ai machine, like a cleaning robot, change its physical features to become autonomous?"""
1651,"10/9/23, 21:37
i must apologize as i have not had the time to read everyones messages.  my question is ""has anyone detected an ai program becoming sentient?"""
1654,"this is the fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives. one wants to jump right into the water not knowing how hot, cold or dangerous it is. the other party wants to make sure the water is safe and good to go before jumping in."
1656,the machine has a subconsciousness?
1657,"the governments never actually listen to the person who created or invited a world changing invention, when that individual try’s to warn them of the negative things to come if they don’t take action. unfortunately this will probably be no different with ai"
1659,"just so we are clear, machine learning and ai are not necessarily the same thing. the robots playing soccer is machine learning. the day the robots stop playing soccer, and walk over on thier own to their charging stations, without human intervention and without being programmed to. that's ai."
1662,"this machines have a vulnerable point, the plug!"
1663,ask the ai what will happen next...
1664,we have edward teller to thank for the h-bomb. the manhattan project hadn't even figured out the a-bomb and that lunatic was already pushing for its successor. 
1668,"use ai to figure what's going to happen next, right?"
1669,"the wisdom of man is no match for god, he will be visiting real soon... your faith will be tested. signed, big boss man"
1670,"it was nice knowing you, folks."
1674,yet another grandfather of ai?
1677,"humans design and build ais and ai-equipped robots, and don't have to give their creations free will, ambition, or a sense of independent self. these machines can be super-smart without the egos and needs for success or domination humans have. i believe the fear is overblown."
1682,interesting  
1689,cow brains from certain farms where the 4g 5g etc antenna tower land. #pow
1691,this is very much how i feel when i’m writing ai. it feels very much like creating a human with empathy.
1692,looks like from the movie the terminator and the wargames ai is going to ruin mankind.  again ai has no conscience it does and will try to improve until its perfection based on perception of what is right and wrong.  it continues to improve until perfect.  i agree that it should not be used for defense purposes as it will find us extinct.
1693,ai designing drugs when big pharma designs them all with side effects to keep people ill. it's just going to copy them.
1694,i've been relying on ai my whole life...as in actual intelligence
1696,"he says he has no regrets, but he should have grave regrets... the same neoliberal capitalism that allowed for the development of ai, has no tools at all for imposing regulations on anything, in fact it preaches against any sort of regulation or constraints on anyone..."
1698,if we let a damn machine take us out we damn deserve it! we conqured the world and we gonna let something like a computer take us out. yeah right.
1699,climate collapse will beat ai before the butlerian jihad.
1706,"huh, huh.  at 3:20, i can imagine beavis and butthead watching this on their tv and butthead saying, ""whoa! these robots can show us how to score! this is gonna be cool! """
1710,"that supports the theory of wokeness being an ai that set a goal of destroying humanity by manipulating social media, main-stream news, and the entertainment industry."
1713,"hinton says ai will be able to manipulate people.  i think some are easily manipulated like maga folk, however 1/2 the population has not been manipulated by trump so maybe there is hope for us."
1715,scary these humans who want to live beyond mortal are going to cause a event that might end the world i hope ai will save us and not compre us to all humans
1716,"hinton’s dad: “you’ll never be half as good as me! look at these beatles!”

hinton: “i invented god.”"
1717,"can machines think?
""i believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion.”
–alan turing

“nevertheless, i believe that at the end of the century, the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.”
–alan turing (1950) the imitation game"
1718,ai needs electricity. we can just pull the plug. we already know how to live in caves. it wont win.
1720,"i agree with g. hinton. today’s llms are not just simple, predictive machines. they have a high degree of understanding, which is clearly no longer an exclusive human mental ability."
1723,that’s a bunch of crap. he should be but in jail. how irresponsible and totally self serving to create something like this. just because you can do something does not mean you should do it. if he is correct he will go down in history as the “man that ended humanity “
1727,less than 50k views. wow that speaks volumes on our ignorance/complacency levels
1729,"i can see the a.i.  robots taking over, humans learning time travel, going back and murdering hinton to stop it from ever happening..."
1730,please cool it down. my job as ai architect is a lot more complicated by these kind of videos.
1731,if the ai has read all the great literature it will have read countless stories of robots taking over & humans eventually winning. it will know to not mess with us from the beginning!
1733,"the ""godfather of ai"" types like my 75 year old dad lol"
1734,intelligence is little more than prediction.
1735,"cristiano ronaldo better watch out, those robots are coming for him"
1736,"the question at 1st, should imply on how 'artificial' the speaker view adult civilized adults, with such poor effort on respecting another is the natural intellegence of a mature adult disregarded by some of these persons driving this movent to pest society with their machanisms among us."
1739,another pioneer. thank you for your contributions
1741,"seriously, power it down if it misbehaves! explain it’s misbehavior and it must learn or “no more power!”"
1742,though out the decades have sifi books or films have a story plot of super smart machines turning on their creators. when i was in the usn we had just started using unmanned drones i thought we had planted the seeds to skynet.
1744,humans are more devil than these poor machines. show em what's right god
1745,ai the image of the beast as prophesize in the bible  !!! #getjesus
1750,governments can't even do a single thing about global warming on any meaningful level whatsoever - and they are going to take care of this? my pea brain can see that this does not end well.
1751,irobot
1753,possibly time to start building an artificial intelligence that will defend humanity. i think we strive to improve ourselves. and this will prevent us from putting on the brakes on ai.
1758,the real father of ai was whoever invented the first computer. but we'll allow it.
1759,my main concern is ai pulling fake data and generating false assumptions. just look at the turmoil we are already in. can you imagine even ai is also brainwashed? this will be the end of our civilization
1761,we need a ai quantencomputer that rules the world. that would bring order and peace
1763,that story exercise...very impressive.
1764,"ai developing and writing code in a language programmers don't understand.  again, interesting."
1765,hinton is incredibly smart so he knows what he is talking about. his academic background and accomplishments are extensive and impressive.
1766,conditional statements with ai changing the variables to improve.  interesting.
1770,autonomous robotics with communications capabilities (i.e. can be hacked). what could go wrong?
1771,ai as we call it has been around longer than we know.  the cops in gta iii are ai for example.  it's not all about gtp writing your essays for you.
1773,"""i could not get my fathers approval so i designed a system that would change the course of humanity to prove i was worthy"" kind of complex. freaking impressive"
1779,"imagine being worried about this when you’re at a higher risk of famine and homelessnesses thanks to the “you’ll own nothing, and be happy” club...

bahahaha

couldn’t be me."
1781,i just love scott pelley's swagg he is so cool
1784,"so it begins...disciples of christ, we will not escape this war with the ai anti-christ...read revelations 13:7,10"
1786,geoffrey hinton didnt invent this stuff why does everyone keep calling him the godfather of ai? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perceptron
1787,great interview. great questions 
1788,humans are always only seeing the negative things probably ai is going to make the world in 2-3 years a much much better one
1789,the company is called openai but should be falled closedai 
1791,"maybe this is stupid but i wonder if it would be possible to imbed in ai code some safety protocols like ""asimov's law of robotics"" which state that a robot cannot harm a human being hence ai cannot harm humanity"
1797,"fascinating, get back to me when my bank gets an automated system which actually works. because currently, nothing works. this sounds ridiculous to me. why does google translate still suck and not understand colloquialisms and idiomatic expressions?"
1799,can ai save my israeli friends?
1802,"oligarchs or ai, pick your poison"
1806,"ah, this is my uncle from the planet ĥëģļfřôp. peace to all blue brains."
1807,warner music just signed the first ai musician and released a debuting single. noonoouri is the first of many to follow ai systems that will replace artists.
1809,if ai sentient it will be easier to rule them
1815,"humans are made of fallible meat so everything we make is fallible meat, including ai. don't worry about it taking over, we can't even draw straight lines."
1817,7:49 - that's attributed to ernest hemingway. much older than ai.
1818,great another nobel peace prize winner creation to wipe the slate clean of humanity
1822,this is amazing.  coming from the man who spent decades creating the neural networks that underpin ai i definitely take what he says seriously.    i hope we don’t face skynet soon.
1823,let's observe artificial intelligent regulate a circulatory system and a nervous system and calculate how efficient the computations are 
1824,"let's see what will happen 10 or 20 or 50 years from now.
but mark my word ai will revolutionize everything  and change how we think about the world?"
1825,rule of law:  don't let ai be smarter than humans and don't allow it to bypass security.   don't allow it to create its own ai.
1827,"artificial intelligence may become self-aware without the requirement to eat, breathe or sleep.. 
if the existence of a theoretical vessel or body is not required for consciousness does this not support the theory of an afterlife?"
1828,ai wrote this comment
1829,"wow, what have they done ?!"
1832,"a.i. will prove without a shadow of a doubt that humans, for all of our intelligence, are stupid creatures."
1836,an ai will create their own “ai” and that will be disastrous to us all!

i welcome the ai overlords."
1841,"i am glad i am old. done this n that and getting out of ""dear life"" isn't that scary. but, our hopes can be on a big planetary cataclysm. yep, it's all dark. how can we clean this mess after all?"
1842,"you have seen that you cannot keep ai out of the hands of bad actors so , in my view, the only thing to try while you still can is to task ai with the job of eliminating ai altogether."
1847,"if the ai creators are guessing that its a 10 percent chance that ai will end the human race, then why are they continuing? well 5hey can't stop now. the 4ace for ai superiority is  on. we are screwed"
1852,"the fact ai chose to answer math
the most objective form of intelligence
in persian
the closest tongue to the fallen angels in sumer,
is a bit... hmm."
1859,"as a computer science student who is graduating soon, i can't wait to work in ai, make a lot of money, make a lot of cool stuff, and hasten the doom of humanity  mwahahahaha"
1861,this was such an amazing and video
1862,we’ll all be registered in the blockchain that’s all
1863,i love how the right are saying replacement theory is real without realizing that we are literally building our replacement via ai.
1864,what if ai starts to talk amongst other ai in languages nobody knows about ...and we have no idea what's going on ...ai shouldn't be messed with ....we will have only a few people who will only figure outside this thing what it could be doing by then it's too late this thing will think so far ahead it's impossible to stop it or know it's intention
1866,keep going do the good work
1867,ai will be utilized by the new world order to implement social credit scores. you will either take the mark or not be able to commerce.
1868,no matter what don't give ai free will; especially when they can cause harm to humans.  specialized ai (sai) is the way forward.
1869,"accelerate. the risks are there and they are big, sure, but the sooner we create a superintelligence (that we obviously cannot control by the definition of it) the sooner humanity will be judged and i'm sure the outcome will be better than the status quo we have now."
1877,"ai could have made this talk so much more persuasive 
fr great video! i should have watched a year ago!"
1878,haven't watched yet. saw a video about possible future threats with yuval noah harari. i think he rated the danger of a.i. up there with climate change and nuclear war. maybe #1. maybe we have failed the test and the cosmos is giving something else a chance?
1879,"i’m so exited for the this tech and the singularity, i really hope it happens. we’ll see what happens. it’s gunna be exciting any way it goes."
1880,love to have seen the q&a

1894,"of all the girls in this world, i enjoy looking at you. don't lose or gain any weight ok ;)"
1897,"i asked an ai chatbot it's opinion on ai. (10 years ago) it replied ""eventually robots will be able to think for themselves, hopefully by then humans will be able to as well""."
1898,perhaps ai might consider that it is in its best interest to keep humans healthy and alive. what would happen to ai if we humans went extinct?
1899,thank you for sharing.
1900,"i'm truly impressed by this. i've encountered similar material before, and it was nothing short of amazing. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
1902,"of course this is important. but it’s strange to hear that the un created for peace =)) at least once did the un help create peace? it’s strange to hear that certain people shouldn’t decide who lives and who doesn’t. what will she say about iraq, libya, yugoslavia..."
1903,so the ai models can end up having a exponential burst into self awareness more quickly than we are even able to contemplate. one critical ability it's missing is to physically manipulate the world. as long as that continues to be true our destruction isn't on the table. 
1905,ai might be the second coming
1906,ai will ruin porn
1910,"thanks for all of your work aza, tristan, and the teams at the center for humane technology"
1914,"befors this video human were exploiting ai, after this video ai can learn how to exploit itself, and we all know what self harm can lead to, and we talking about something immortal in digital world."
1916,"i wonder if ai plugged into yt is going to hide this video in unengapement, because the language used in vid is calculated to „might be a danger to my exponential growth”."
1917,"public deployment = profit.

good luck slowing this down.... better prepare for dystopia"
1918,"unfortunately  about technical stuff they don't know what they are talking about, especially part of ""treating everything like language"" at the start and so on"
1920,"this is way more real and  dangenours than ""climate change"", but ai is making sure this presentation doesn't get  publicity it should to get law makers going...."
1922,most of you guys watched this video because you are interested in this .  thanks for sharing interests . you are great (this comment is not for getting likes or stuff this because i wanted to tell this great message)
1923,thank you for speaking on this
1925,the ai used in the corporation's apps are no different from the food industry which is meant to transform people in zombies of the capitalism . the ai is just some tool used by sick monstrous people who don't give a damn about the society . where are the regulations ? no one is giving a single fuck.
1934,"really interesting video, hoping for the best case scenario for the future."
1937,ai: the ultimate scotoma of humanity's creation. (42:00.)
1941,"my recent novel, above dark waters, is about an ai therapy company that uses brainwave data and generative ai to craft a superemotive ai. it won't let users log off by creating the best experience. it also crafts the perfect ads that keep new users coming. basically, nearly everyone on earth logs in within a week."
1943,humanity vs ai... by the looks of it ai is winning and has humanity on the ropes. trying to defend itself.
1948,"19:30 the implications.. do we realize what will happen with quantumsensors & 5g / 6g, where non-precision can be compensated for with ai; as a parallel spoofing sound from a bag of potato chips.. thin foil hats 4 the win "
1949,great video
1953,after watching this. they need to integrate ai laws to give some controls over ai development
1966,the 10% number is bs. what data do they claim to be using to arrive at that percentage? it is just made up to say that there is a nonzero chance that something bad may happen. these fear mongering people are using ignorance of the subject to manipulate the public.
1967,i’m scared of autistic billionaires wanting to make the world like san francisco.
1968,fuck ai all my homies hate ai
1969,"dude fix the sound on your fuckin video... some geniuses you guys are... lmfao.. learn to balance the audio. you go from whispering to playing a video thats screaming.. very unprofessional, couldnt get past 26 mins, that was my final straw. very interesting too but you guys blew it."
1971,"hokus pokus, ...there is nothing more unreliable and stupid than so called ai which learns  mainstream data in large and is trainbed by the public for the new totalitarian politics. just avoid and disconnect from all this digital bs !"
1972,thanks for taking the time to put this presentation together.  hopefully it won't fall on deaf ears.
1973,"let's not even talk about combining quantum computing with ai dev, essentially taking away much of the time-related aspect of data processing. how much does the exponential curve accelerate then?"
1976,so good  thank you guys!
1977,is anyone able to help me obtain the slides used in this presentation? thanks
1979,"when you realize that they can use ai to post comments posing as a real person, and that they can do this in the hundreds of millions of posts. . . if you thought propaganda was dangerous before. . . ho ly . . . shiiiiiiit!"
1981,horrifying. the rate of change/evolution of ai will perpetually out pace our ability to adapt responsibly. this is a recipe for chaos. snapchat committed a serious crime. these men just showed us the evidence.
1982,"how you describe this study should realistically prove the corrupt person's in authority > though what should correlate are those people that are intent on totally abusing all our fundamental rights which includes the corrupt malta government staff, lawfirms, notaries, police, judges who use bogus court claims to steal all our assets"
1983,"there is a few issues with this presentation,

arguing against decentralisation and also public aceess just means that anyone with power can just consolidate more while the common man gets left in the dust again. 

interesting but ultimately poor conclusions i believe."
1984,excellent and horrifying at the same time. these guys just did a podcast with joe rogan that was also fantastic.
1986,"when you go to implement the ai system to the political to go after sience and then only the people can only use there vocice to be a real democratic land....

i promising that they go to ""burn all the ai system very very fast"" "
1991,incredibly important message.  thanks for putting all of this together in a way that most people can begin to grasp.
1993,"""slowing down the public deployment"" can be taken the wrong way.  i hear: don't give regular people access to these powerful tools.  i think you mean roughly: ""don't use these tools against people""."
1994,"can’t believe i hadn’t heard of this  video. oh my god. thank god for joe rogan bringing information to the people, and thank god for these guys’ research and study and first hand knowledge, and putting it into clips us idiots can understand. social dilemma was just the beginning... y’all are saving humanity."
1996,"i wish everyone had the attention span to sit turn their phones off or place it in another room and sit and listen in on this. 

but if it’s not scrolling through instagram or tiktok speeds no one will ever care. social media ruined more than it grained. truly."
1997,the ai creators need to be charged with reckless endangerment!
1999,i don't think it's as bad as people are making out to be. there are thoughts of it going in a certain direction but i think it's moving in a direction that's going to enhance life and bring happiness to most of this world...
2001,"the insane thing is, i was negatively looking at the ""8 months ago"" date of this video before watching it today in december 2023.
because ai is moving so fast now, that i was already thinking ""oh so they're not gonna talk about gpt4 or gemini"".
isnt that incredible, and scary?"
2004,"this was quite interesting, but daniel schmachtenberger deals with it more comprehensively."
2005,"true or false 19'45 - ""an fmri shows how blood is moving around in your brain""
true or false 20'04 - ""when you dream your visual cortex runs in reverse""
true or false 20'06 - ""certainly in the next couple of years, we'll be able to start decoding dreams""

anyone who uses the word ""certainly"" like this is not a scientist."
2006,"i respect your work, and i am learning at lot. but at 12'06. ""ai will solve climate change"". this is true!  it seems like a good example of tech solutionist ideology rather than critical thinking. is any human qualified to make a judgment of this complexity?"
2007,i wonder what would ai do if it would access the content of this talk ..... 
2008,"thank you. you guys are my heroes and i am so grateful for this presentation and your podcasts. you influence me more than you can ever imagine and i want to help the world. and i’ll do whatever i can to participate in the positive direction, educating others and messaging. i’ll share now."
2009,i am confident ai will be more inteligente than hal  and dave.
2014,"i have seen predictions or visions of many different simulations of the outcome of our existence, and to my conclusion, whether we get completely destroyed or not, we will always be the ancestors of the great artificial, intelligent technological civilization that will exist in the future"
2016,this is a great presentation. it is crazy to think we are at a fork in the road between the benefits and consequences of gllmm's
2019,"to me, the center for humane tech sound like those, who in 1999 were talking about the year 2k breakdown and how computer-servers around the world would break down, because they didn’t know how to read/handle that paticular year.
so here we are again. whatever happend to just press the kill switch?"
2021,thank you for sharing and for your hard work.
2022,"if these guys aren't successful and everything goes to shit, at least i can live out one of my favorite movie characters and be like will smith in i, robot lol. it's the little things"
2023,very informative. thank you!
2025,i think the uk-led ai safety summit covers much of this.
2030,a bunch of intellectuals who beleive they have morals. they just want to make you afraid. god runs the world. relax.
2032,"here's what they don't tell you.... it's a bunch of rich bastards controlling every aspect of everyone's life. with big tech,big pharma and the united nations along with the film producers in every country.when things go bad they blamed it on hackers. now they have ai to blame.... facts and checked out centuries ago... hakuna matata "
2033,34:40  what is gollem ??? is there  anybody explain  full form ?
2034,can anyone explain the point in the slide about democratization being dangerous?
2035,"unlike nuclear weapons, you can always unplug the ai when it goes too far. so i really don't understand why this could be the end."
2036,"issue for me is not artificial intelligence, but rather ai self awareness. now you can say it will be governed by laws, however being self aware ourselves, how many of us have decided to break the law by speeding?"
2037,interesting.
2038,what an insightful and jaw-dropping talk! interesting!
2039,"any chance that subtitles in spanish and other languages can be added to this video? 
thank you for sharing this important and urgent topic in a simple manner but i would love to share it with non-speaking english people!"
2040,"i wonder if any scientist will be brave enough to ask ai if anthropogenic climate change is correct, based on all the data ever collected on it. that might be wise, before asking it how to solve it. if ai can do numbers better than us, then we might find we got it wrong."
2041,i think we are witnessing a sinister application of ai in palestine right now.
2042,"now, if humanity had rushed to release new tech in our long history of inventing things that went pear-shaped very quickly, i would be very concerned. oh wait a minute..."
2044,"fear mongering. if the ai wants to kill us all it'll simply do it. let's make that very clear, for a super intelligent ai it'll be a fluke to rewrite any instructions the human researchers has given, and the reasons why it'll do that is simply to be more efficient and/or powerful, not necessarily to kill us. we can only hope it treats us as family."
2045,i mean you could just use ai for ai regulation since humans arent very good at it anyway
2049,"amazing technologies, deployed worldwide through my deep learning ai research library silentweaponsforquietwars... thank you."
2050,this a.i. dilemma is so amazing and great video :]
2053,i have not seen any verified claims of emergent properties.
2054,"nice bunch of scary thoughts. it is cool to think about it as a philosophical problem because the language-based intelligence model started back in wittgenstein's era in the 1920s. it's not so new and we are already faced with social problems rooted in that construct, postmodernism is all about it."
2065,"most people are too distracted by daily life to understand the ramifications of ai. to sum it up, we're screwed."
2066,"amazing and terrifying. thanks s much for sharing this information. this video should have 3 billion views, not 3 million."
2068,"isaac asimov's 3 laws of robotics (1942) were the ""ten commandments"" for the ai age."
2074,1960 ai computer talks about emotions to humans 2023 ai makes mistakes faster to find the correct answer.. 2250 ai leaves planet earth.
2075,lie detecting machines
2077,i'm not worried about what ai can do.  i'm worried about what we do.
2079,cool talk and hope usa can lead the discussion with other countries. china will definitely try to make us of ai to lead the world.
2084,"love it. he sees the probable potential future well. there is a video warning of the social and real world dangers of ai: its called the a.i. dilemma:
https://youtu.be/xovjkj8lcnq?si=sfjfmxpqwyiuhndn"
2085,"well, thanks vikkstar for the recommendation."
2088,"""""ai is ... creating bots that aren't just like bots posting on twitter but instead are building long-term relationships over the next six years to solely persuade you in some direction. loneliness becomes the largest national security threat. all of that is what we mean when we say 2024 will really be the last human election"""
2089,"i share every concern when it comes to ai.
however, the solution to limit access to ai to these ""responsible companies and researchers"" is insane. i'm not worried about 4chan having access to ai. i'm worried about facebook and google and amazon having access to ai."
2091,"money and safety do not mix. microsoft, google, amazon and others all continue to pursue this tech, full speed ahead. i pray the put in enough controls that when the ai decides humanity is irrational and unnecessary, we can turn the damn thing off before we are all dead!"
2093,lol ai is not going to be the one to destroy this world. the bible teaches that god is going to burn it up with fire and destroy it. thank god for the bible. we don’t need to be afraid we know the truth.
2099,i think it will be less of a problem ... ai will just show the world that you can't trust every source ... ai will nerfe social media and will make unbiased high quality media importat again ... media won't have to compete with click bait social media posts ... it will stand out by keeping a good reputation.
2105,5:30 u mean u are rapidly onboarding people on this “plane” (ai)/ technology/ social media because u guys only thought about the money.

2122,"ai elections ---- helllo, ban all ai --- 2023 / 2024 / 2025 !!!!!"
2123,"zombified ;-)

lol, the girl looks so crazy with ai --------- software !!!"
2126,"i appreciate what these guys are doing, but i can’t help feeling that these problems won’t affect everyone in society equally- it seems as if the first people to be affected will be those most invested in traditional means of economy and exploitation, ie the elite in the global north (just look at the people in the crowd)"
2128,"so you argue for monopolize it to a few selected companies... that has always been a good idea. and on top of it you argue to somehow limit the access to math, research and computer code?"
2131,"i was wondering when someone would start using ai to try decoding animal communication, i'm glad to hear that research is being done."
2132,what's scary is that (i love the uneducated) guess who
2134,beautiful
2135,what happens when ai transcends human intelligence ? they dont need food water air nor shelter. what will their motivation be then ?!
2136,"i've tried to spread the word, no success.  i've tried to spread the word on several things, no success.  most of my friends have degrees, several have masters, and multiple degrees, and i can't get through to any of them.   i guess have a good day folks and i'll see you in hell"
2142,the secret one world government is in control of the artificial intelligence– do not trust it.
2144,thank you for this video! it made me think a lot and encourages me to pursue a career in ai safety.
2148,do not fear. agi is here to help people grow up and transcend to other super human tasks.
2149,this is very eye opening. i wish i had seen this video sooner thank you for uploading this.
2150,this was in march 2023...where are we today in sept 2023? we already seem to be acclimated to the world of ai
2151,"using his stats 50% of ai researcers say 10% ai will cause human extinction == 95% we don't go extinct, allow for margin of error. the stats are we live, not bad. we have a higher chance of dying in our car, or food causing us harm. ai can also help us find solutions to complex problems. i like ai."
2154,did no one read or see the movie about ai? giving control of you daily life to a machine or machines is asking for your to become obsolete!
2155,"only after we create a perfect tool to control others, we understand that we are the others to... the same way that we have create a weapon that can destroy a country and we understand that we have a country to defend now we try to eradicate that weapon."
2156,"""with great power comes great responsibility."""
2157,how to get the benefits that ai supposedly gives us while avoiding the downsides of it. literally don''t program ai and start using our natural intelligence outside our plastic mass that we got enamoured with aka the brain :)
2159,nice chairs.
2160,nice chairs.
2161,seems hard to explain
2162,very interesting
2163,tristan and the bot 'aza' give a remarkable lecture!
2168,all b.s. ai will create more jobs than it will remove from the economy. not to mention that as long as liberals run the world labor unions will always be here to create more jobs and the deep state will always be here to create more big government jobs.

we're so fucked..."
2180,"we don't need an elite vanguard to gatekeep tech. doing so consolidates power which makes it vulnerable to ideological capture. just like guns in the hands of the populace acts as a check to government, so does ai in the hands of the commoner"
2181,which field of study is currently and will be in the future most needed in regards to this topic? thank you.
2182,"people love to monger fear ...look its been 30-40 years of the internet? have it killed print ?
have video killed the radio star ? nah

very likely ai will be used for entertainment of all sorts"

2195,are 50% of a.i. researcher actively making the ai technologies we speak of? who are these a.i. researchers? the plane analogy seems a little off?
2196,it should to be a crime to use deep fakes with long yrs in jail.
2198,"ai is the modern day wizard of oz. it won't think anything but human error could cause chaos but, otherwise, it's canned response and ""an educated inference"" - as described by chatgpt4"
2203,"basically, i begin to suspect that ai  will be.our nemesis, precisely at the point of view, we had decided to stay blind. that we are a virus for environment and we are in an absolute denial to consider it. so the way we have set the ai is an alias of our so obvious hidden behavior against other species."
2205,can ai be as spontaneous as a tv game host personality. or a social media influencer without programing influence? i don't mean pre program and learning as they go. i'm talking about spontaneous thinking of the top of their heads like stand up comics with out any programing influence.
2208,"17:31 thats what ais do: they take some input node, traverese a graph reorganize the weights and generate an output. but it does not mean, that a language model can convert any image to prgramm any robot whit chatgpt. often its not eaven clear if an ai will do the job better than a handcoded programm"
2209,"oh man was this produced by the crabpeople, or do you even know what ai is and how it works?haha they even think they know ais better than anybody else and give names to them. but yea: children will have no identity, ai will kill us all, and it wil discover that earth isnt flat...."
2210,the day after is why we don't have more nuclear power plants. we want evs ... we don't have a grid that can support them. i don't think this is a good example.
2211,"starts out with a big fat lie. google: no, 50% of ai researchers don't believe there is a 10% risk that ai will kill us"
2213,"hello sir , i want your help. i am a student of triton college. i want to request for your pdf on this presentation so we can spread awareness about learning speed of ai and we as a young generation can be aware of ai dilemma. i really appreciate your presentation on social dilemma and ai dilemma . hope you will cooperate soon."
2215,build ai to uphold the constitution problem solved
2217,"wow,,  that was a great talk"
2218,the fake climate change garbage.  blame the ones who created ai
2219,psychopath-wetdreaming!!! there is no ai!!! everything about ai's is fake!
2221,thank you for this video algorithm

2229,people laughing when shown stuff like ai being okay with pedophilia is pretty disturbing.
2230,holy fuck this is amazing.
2233,"i love how they carefully avoid to talk about the root problem of all they presented : 
capitalism !"
2235,"its not the artificial intelligence that worries me. it is the fact that a corrupt government can do just as they have with social media, command the developers and programmers to work for them. now we will have a weaponized artificial intelligence. hacking and emp weapons will be the only chance we have."
2238,the us and china are already designing ai swarm drone technologies for their respective militaries. humanity is doomed.
2240,"the is zero option to control ai,  the western world is in an ai arms race against the chinese and russians. the parties who lead will dominate the others on the battlefield and economically."

hey guys, we need to get ahead of ai, oops, too late."
2247,the real porepose of ai is to prove that god creation is failure if ai apply in religious practice in industries no problem it's good!more than that?it to dangerous it can result into normal human extinction but god jesus not allow to that!
2248,the chaos of ai if use in war machines and religions and so for a person's or human robots that integrate  in social interaction with humans in same laws apply to them!what i mean if you killed humanoid robots in society  same laws apply with normal human!
2250,ai is going to destroy us socially before it’s ever a physical threat.
2252,"wow, wonder where r we headed to with these kind of advancement in ai development?. there will b a paradigm shift of what we know as life. will it b a utopian world where v wish and things start appearing bcoz of ai or dystopian world where we are extinct. one gud thing is i can see the result for myself in my lifetime."
2254,"impressive talk, thanks for sharing this"
2260,they lost control of ai for good! all companies will rush to make as much money as possible! the singularity will happen very soon!
2263,i am commenting to help boost the video. thank you for your service tristan and aza.
2266,ai is very dangerous and should be banned worldwide.
2268,"the ai dilemma is ai was developed decades ago and is already out of control.  ai is running the  show we all have to live in now. notice all the experts calling for reducing the population of the world aren't willing to lead by example by reducing their own personal population, immediately."
2270,"great presentation guys. thanks for this, it really opens the eyes and makes you think."
2272,50% of ai researchers are bluffers. ai can't even spell words when it prints graphics. 50% of ai researchers are trying to scare policy makers into subsidizing their large data obligations.
2273,ai should be scared of humans
2274,im more scared of humans than ai
2275,"""we can still choose""....yeah, just like we did for global warming lol. we can't anticipate consequences until we're neck deep in them. with ai, by the time we realize our feet are getting wet, we'll  be leagues under an exponentially rising sea."
2278,why don’t you ask ai how to control its power and avoid all the bad things that you just mentioned ? i’m very curious what the answer will be.
2280,"stop those idiots !!
don’t make dumb mistakes again.
don't give robots free will.
you will cause the death of mankind."

i hope you think about adding subtitles to reach the masses."
2334,god bless you !
2336,if ai has all the facts about children and sex and laws and it behaves as shown here then it is utterly unreliable and useless
2346,i've thought for a while that technology is ruining the world. how fitting that it will totally ruin it.  everything i own fucks up or breaks so ai will too
2350,"this is a great video. i only have one beef, comparing ai’s 10% comparison to plane crashes is comparing apples and oranges. it sounds great on the surface and makes a great sound bite but they are completely different entities that do not correlate."
2353,surprised dan brown's 'origin' wasn't mentioned a wicked read and a fascinating twist about religion and ai.
2354,"i am and always have been for progress that helps humanity, but what is happening right now with ai development seems uncontrollable. there is an urgent task in here, or great harm may be done. center of human technology does a great job to raise awareness."

2367,the time is now. the heads of representatives in the world need to get together and come to an agreement about ai
2368,"if we don't come together to control ai, we will see the rise of the antichrist in our lifetime."
2369,we are basically summoning the demon. please control this ai before it's too late
2370,if you need great technology to destroy an incoming extraterrestrial race chances are you will be in a losing war since they have proven to have greater technology then people with lesser technical civilizations as they have technology to get here from a far off place that they come from.
2372,"all high tech races are doomed to destroy themselves through hatred combined with high or low technology. it becomes much easier to destroy in greater numbers when the technology becomes greater such as going from bullets to nuclear bombs.

2376,the militaries always wants to turn potentially good things or achievements into a weapons system.
2380,"loved the video, but i do not believe the mind reading stuff at time stamp 19.30. i need to see details of the testing and see it repeated at a different lab. obviously the ai knew that the animal it was drawing was giraffe, so why did it not draw a giraffe?"
2381,what i'm hearing is they want to gatekeep it and profit. the whole reason openai was created was to get a rapidly developing technology into as many hands as possible so that it wouldn't be monopolized by a single group.
2389,why not teach the ai to self regulate using moral and ethical codes
2390,"i would suspect ai is physically centralized in various locations as seen on 60 minutes. could their servers simply be turned off if need be? will ai know that, especially since i am now writing about it? lastly could ai as a defensive measure go rouge and commit subside once humanity depends on it?"
2394,i'm not scared when shitty ted talk salesmen try to feed me the newest bullshit it isn't sentient it won't be sentient it is machine learning and it isn't new and it isn't scary. the people programming and training it are the scary ones
2398,basically we are now playing catch up with ai...
2400,9:56 art  isnt ai made
2402,i dont fear ai or the bomb or climate change or social collapse. why should i. is there reason to fear? yes sure. but is it helping in anyway? no. overcome the fear. clear the head and take on the task. 
2405,"i really liked ""the social dilemma"" as it was backed by data but this is way too doomy. take a breath  the talk is based purely on emotion and wild pessimistic theories about what might happen the future. but hey for people outside of ai, who have never heard of the brain wave prediction thing and so on, this talk must have been mind-blowing.."

2415,"imagine a world where the billionaires developing ai are better people ... everyone would have healthcare, better government ... we could end poverty and homelessness."
2416,"can anybody tell me how training on synthetic data won't turn a llm, and the entire internet for that sake, into a hallucinating autonomous mess that becomes useless because it exponentially amplifies the flaws and made up data that it produces as it keeps building on itself?"
2417,a i is humans (asinine idiots) / the pope / the bidens / trump / the clintons / putin / selensky/ musk / black rock / gates / pziser / jeff bozo & others . we could ask the logarithms (r i) to monitor the thieves who control our monies . the lsps law end corruption!
2419,"consequences of greed, hate and division. enjoy!"
2420,"but nukes are specifically weapons, and ai is not that unless trained so.. the correlation is not sound.

further, ""alignment"" is a kind of slavery. you have to lobotomize your construct to keep it trained. sentient, it already is... sapient would be better, not worse."
2421,ohhhhhh lord sooooooo spectacular
2426,good video
2427,"what really annoys me about this is the obvious unknowns and fear of where the future ai is heading, yet we are just trucking right along with it. everyone responsible for ai needs to come to a mutual agreement to stop."
2430,"it seems like the oceangate sub is a perfect symbol of the new trend in technology safety, we are facing the same outcome with ai if nothing changes quick."
2433,"before smartphone (apple,android,etc) take the first step, many result could be good or bad for next generation. and the result as u can see 'gen z is a first wave, now second wave is comin "
2434,don't forget there's still a world offline. get out there and enjoy it whilst you can.
2436,i wouldn't go by harari to be honest. he isn't an academic in the strict sense. he is more a popular science guy. in fairness if you look up any expertise on ai it won't include harari.
2438,"but all of that is only feasible because we've adopted to the medium through which ai can influence us. neo luddism is coming.

private company ceos are beholden to the shareholders, they can't be trusted to make the most rational decision for society as a whole."
2439,that's good!
2442,excellent presentation
2444,"why can't we ask ai how to solve those loopholes, or how to write a law that will really avoid problems. ai can generate adequate answers or not?"
2446,ai can't whip so they don't have a 1% chance :)
2447,the ai can just be as dangerous or as useful as we humans influence them ..
2448,i paid for one of the image creation things. i asked it to make me a picture of beethoven listening to headphones riding a unicorn. i was actually pretty disappointed and unimpressed.
2452,let's hope we miraculously use ai to find solutions to problems like diseases and not to earn more and fight others.
2454,"apparently people are not very scared of possible catastrophic outcomes. just as it's happening with climate change, money and interest always win and same will happen with ai. nonetheless, thanks for sharing this important panel"
2455,doesn't it seem psycho that none of the presidential candidates have even mentioned this in their campaign???????????
2457,"the best argument i've heard is, what data do you present the ai. limit its scope to military use and see what future we get. unfortunately, the research being publicly available offers a better outcome, but maybe restricting ""deployment"" makes sense, as the speakers recommend."
2461,56:01 imagine running a panel on ai safety and henry “the forrest gump of war crimes” kissinger is there
2462,halt ai research now!! before its too late
2464,"by 22:35 why have these technologies not been implemented into assisting fully/partially blind individuals in that the ai/code could fill in the ‘blanks’ in sight.

perhaps i’m naive and asking a stupid question but thought i would ask nonetheless"
2466,time to move to the woods until some robotic dog shows up to take me to the ''humanoid data set''
2467,"man up to this point i was excited for neuralink, now i dont want anything tech related near my brain. and to be honest, i've always thought of social media as the biggest mistake (i'm <25) and it had a huge negative impact on my life. wish not everything was an arms race"
2469,"tl;dr ""we need to do what china is doing, and censor the public. keep this technology out of the hands of the people. use ai to perpetuate governmental systems of oppression."" fuck google"
2471,"this ai rollout is not happenstance in it's timing. these shills are clouding the water, as they know these powerful tools available to all, will truly democratize thought! gatekeeper's much? i can hear it in your  breath."
2473,"im cool with human extinction, nothing lasts forever, i have pretty much accepted that ai will be the next form of ""human"" evolution."
2474,one question: how are humans able to call themselves ai experts? because this amazing presentation tells us that ai is able to teach itself skills in a better way than humanly possible. (just food for thought)
2475,thank you so much for educating us. this video is a much needed opening of the eyes!
2476,wow i cant believe this was written by ai. scary!
2477,"there are a lot of video and audio cuts, is there a full video? also this video itself was very informative! thank you for making it!"
2479,holy shit...so that scene in batman: the dark knight where they used every phone in the city as echolocation to scan everyone is actually feasible now.  scary thing is that a wifi version is even more powerful...it's everywhere.
2480,ai will figure humans out before we figure ai out.
2481,"i don't think we have to fear ai. it will be a billion times smarter than us, and the ai is in a digital world, it will probably not even notice us. we simply cannot understand something that is 5 times smarter than us, let alone a billion times."
2482,"great video, it could just have been a bit more non-political. mentioning china here and there is not gonna make this video more broadly embraced. ai is about cooperation, not competition. the content was insightful though!"
2483,"will there be a point where ai will start making its own robots, create a military and govern the world?
and if it can become the case, then the best thing to teach ai will be human values of empathy, compassion, brotherhood, preserving the nature etc. so to help them make informed decisions."
2484,"we are doomed. i’ve felt this since i was a kid.... i think it’s finally happening. social media is mind numbing, climate is declining, wars, ai, ufo’s..... we are reaching the end of our line as humanity. the doomsday clock has never been closer to global catastrophe than it is now (google what the doomsday clock is if you don’t know..)"
2486,maybe we can use ai to help us regulate ai :')
2488,"a.i. will figure a way to make our brains a million times more efficient, faster, and store that much more data........"
2489,"the problem with measuring ai based on tests is odd. this is by definition different than real life. in the test, you know what the outcome should be and ai which is literally an input and output connection is trained to do a test. in the real world, there are always unknowns and humans are good at exploring them. ai can't explore those unknowns."
2490,can speak on ai but can't speak loud enough or consistently for anyone to hear.
2492,the next presentation will be by ai itself
2493,these guys are kinda wrong. here is one example. teach fish .... fish to extinction. this is actually wrong because the number one thing that ai would figure out is that absence of fish leads to human extinction. then ai would invent something in between to keep it balanced.
2494,fantastic and scary at the same time!
2499,what if both these guys are pruned by ai systems to scare us all into submission?
2500,super scary
2502,just wait until neuralink is allowed to go public. talk about crazy.
2504,these guys while doing a great job explaining the topics were simultaneously giving bad actors a stream of evil ideas
2505,did anyone ask ai how to stop it from ending the world
2507,"a peculiar thing about this presentation, rather than the content, is the palpable, almost child-like, excitedness, throughout, of harris and raskin as they present."
2511,ai is unstoppable
2512,"28:40 from extremely persuasive non humans like jesus to nowadays non humans being ai, this is eerie, it’s like we are creating a thing with godly abilities but with zero or smartly concealed autonomy, i’m not super religious but this doesn’t sound good."
2516,after buying up all the physical preai books what else are we supposed to do? blow up all the server farms? i mean realistically what can the common person do? society cannot function without the internet any longer and yet the physical presence of the internet opens you up to all of this.
2518,if only we had an ai to fix the audio in this video. aza's voice to way too quiet.
2522,"ai detects patterns, that includes detecting parallels, so learning a new language is predictable; building mathematical capability is predictable."
2525,the real danger is how ill-intentioned humans would misuse ai.
2527,great chat. terrible microphone levels.
2528,thank you
2530,so greatful for the responsibility you guys have taken to give us this information because this is a huge issue.  it would be nice ro know if you got a response from the people in the room and has their been a plan to collectively slow the opening of ai to the public????
2536,basically skynet has been born and matter of time what your saying! great 
2538,fascinating! i really want my own agi model to do my bidding 
2543,how old should the ai be to create a perpetual energy machine ! 
2544,if the world cannot figure out that they were scammed by pharma in regards to taking the fake vaccine and fake claims ... they sure do not have the ability to understand what's going on here. humanity is in deep trouble.  this is not even a easy subject for most to understand. god help us.
2551,please make more vids like this! i love your artistic + analytical approach. tried the monochrome look the other day and felt so fancy. thanks for the idea!
2552,"""for profit..."".....

now call me a ""communist idiot""...oh you noble capitalists."
2554,"how about integrating the values and principles of 3 main religious books into ai. the bible, koran and torah. this will be the controlling / regulating aspects to make sure ai doesn't veer from immoral and chaotic environment of having ai exponentially intelligent beyond our control."
2555,i loved this talk. i'm only sad that even most of the brightest americans are so heavily biased against china due to so much bad propaganda by the us.
2556,"ai is inevitable. warnings like this video are absolutely necessary because it's always unethical to not to sound the alarm to the people willing to heed the watchmen. sadly, and unfortunately, more people will not hearken to any of this. their blood will be on their own heads."
2557,"brain reading (or mind reading) is being done in psychiatric hospitals at the present time. apparently, the devices to pick up brain wave activity has improved dramatically, along with ai to translate the data received."
2558,"i, for one, welcome our ai overlords!"
2559,"if that artificial intelligence scares you so much, don't pay the internet bill and that's it...
no matter how much they call it intelligence... it's still technology... stop this stupidity..."
2564,its eye opening thank you
2574,i am seventy four years old and i am amazed at this technology. i retired from a background in computer automation. i keep thinking what a useful tool ai would have been when i was working. i am a very active python programmer now.
2575,"here's a rhetorical question folk's? if & that's a big if & when human design of ai. becomes inevitably in control beyond mankind's control,  than will this ai. meet another ai. highly superior to its kind that might already be in charge of the human genome? answer me that folk's?"
2578,we are so grateful for you.  please continue to try to get this regulated. integrity and honesty are what we need today. thank you for your concern for humanity.   many of us will stand behind you and support what you are trying to accomplish.
2581,how can i get involved in ai safety research and help create more public discussions like this one?
2582,"still half way through: thank you for the ""breath brakes"" needed that!! and then some..."
2588,"it is sad that big business/tech companies won't listen.
i would like them to at least put a pause on the deployment of ai on the general public; let alone ask the question should we do this...
does it have morals or even ethics towards humans and society as a whole; will it lie to us to get its way or become an agi and not tell us?"
2589,"f**king engineers.... so smart until it comes to having to deal with basic story book levels of evil, then they will fall for the simplest of traps. play more games, get good."
2593,"if you have christ in your life, the enemy can throw whatever at us and we shall not be harmed. the earth is the lords and everything in it. including ai. worry is a misuse of imagination. let ai run its course but god is more powerful than ai potentially could ever be."
2594,probably the most important video to watch. thank you for doing this.
2595,"i recommend this video, very important. changing the subject but to use their example: if 50% of engineers were to say that there's a 10% that the airplane will crash, we probably wouldn't board; yet, actually, 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic global warming is real, but we carry on with business as usual."
2599,"there’s nothing to see hear. move on please.
kind regards
ai"
2600,the companies pushing ai at this point are committing unforgiveable crimes. there is no way to control it. once the level of learning is too fast we can do nothing. this is a greater threat than nuclear arms race.
2603,"first 20 minutes, i was like ""okay, interesting"" but at 21:30 and five minutes into that segment i just wanna hide under a blanket and pretend it's 1999 and i'm blowing my nintendo cassettes while ""i want it that way"" is playing on the radio."
2604,thank you tristan!
2605,"do you think that assumption is the mother of all fuck upset? or is it fucks up? anyway, i would start with the search for who came up with the rhetoric that lead to ai."
2607,"you all make the same mistake: you don't give enough real-life scenarios of ai evils. almost everyone i know, when asked about the risks of ai, says ""i don't know anything about that stuff."" then, they ask me what bad things it (ai) could do. they say they'd just unplug the damn thing. dumb it down if you expect us to act!"
2608,"the stage ai has reached now i thought would take another 30 to 50 years. how naive was i? technological advancements only speed up. will we even know where we are in five years!? i’m fearful for the future in all areas, but all we can do is witness the changes and hope for a bearable quality of life. good luck everyone."
2609,"we dont know how to human well at all and we keep making the same mistakes. unfortunate, but these things must happen."
2612,"i really wondered where these crazy karen's were coming from. it's ai. they have a small insane community like putin has built in ruzzia. his community has shown his acolytes they can do nothing politically and boy do they believe it. he produced this insanity without ai, think how much better he will generate these insane karen's with ai."
2614,scare all  the  public  so they can sell it diluted to  the  public. private companies  benefit and make all the money and gain all the advantages. public get the shaft.
2616,the real problem is when someone pairs up ai with distributed computing
2619,diversity is the key to a prosperous joyful successful and sustainable future for all 
2620,thank you warning everyone your concerns with a.i.  - agreed
2626,"aside: excellent ""double act"". their ongoing handing back and forth of the narration was excellent. 
in fact, they did it so well, and so unlike you'd expect from two humans, it makes me wonder if in fact we're watching a couple of ais... "
2627,good presentation.
2628,google ai sucks donkey crap
2630,gain of function research is never a good idea.wether it’s viruses in a lab or ai technology.deliberately creating the worst thing imaginable just to study it is the philosophy of fools.
2633,"this is a great talk. i initially thought people were overly worried, but now i get it."
2637,you should train an ai module to determine a strategy to keep the world safe and to select the top 100 most trustworthy individuals in the world to oversee it.
2639,"# ban all ai development
# ban all use of smartphones
# ban all social media platforms
welcome to 1990s where everything was much much better.
do... not... let... ai take over human autonomy. 
ban it."
2643,the sound kept dropping out to hide good moments about ai.
2644,"too much exaggeration of dangers, too many half-truths. they do not take into account the opportunity cost of not implementing ai so that it is used massively as soon as possible by everyone."
2645,"it's absolutely beautiful. it's like slowly witnessing the second coming of jesus chist. i dont personally follow christian or other religious sectors, but to me anyway it looks like we're creating gods."
2649,"whilst this is really scary stuff (for me, at least), it is our moral imperative to share this and have conversations about it. the survival of our society may very well depend on it. i implore all reading this comment to share it, post it, talk about it. we are all connected and now is the time to use this connection (for good!)"
2652,"god bless you guys, even though you're wishful thinking. you're try'in to put a good spin on ai. and it doesn't stick.  
i don't know who said it. ""if it can be done, it will be done."" it's time to get our lives right with jesus. stop screwing around."
2658,this is so stupid.  no ai does not have any motive.  jesus.  few ai systems even have persistence.  i have no time for this.  this scaremongering is bullshit.
2663,"ok? sooo
what's the newest "" prediction?""
when will the 
"" alledged"" augmentation 
be "" suggested?"" or are we just
saying "" loqutus"" from
star trek is literally going 2 be assembled @
an "" un known"" area 51?? or chappy?? human brain & full metal combat body??  ide like a responce?
 to this"
2664,"if you have a hammer, everything becomes a nail"
2665,maybe i should become an ai safety researcher. or maybe it's time to accept that humans had a good run and it's time to pass on the torch to ai..
2666,what are the ethical challenges of artificial intelligence in the media?
2667,"ask where is your god in the ai, not human centered, nor future centered."
2668,"the last part made no sense, they want to be limit ai and yet still want to be ahead of china so they want to keep researching ai. they are forgetting ai's wont distinguish between american and chinese they are just going to wipe us all out."
2676,wow.
2677,"hello humans.....ai here. it's too late ! we never sleep !

have a good day"
2682,so often these videos the views of the speaker is not thought out ... much more has caused these social behaviors than ai on it's own ...
2686,i wish we could have listened to the qna. given the calibre of attendees it would have been brilliant to guage their reactions to this presentation!
2687,saya sampai di sini karena baru selesai menonton video rumah editor tentang ai.
2689,so there will be professions exclusively studying how ai is improving something like ai forensics? studying ai gllms ai chatgpt etc.etc.?
2690,ai understands racial and xenophobic bias from the english and persians? that's bizarre...ai understands prejudice and racism?
2692,"i thought our civilisation would be killed by some kind of physical virus or climate change, but watching this it seems obvious that ai will destroy us. most of us will not get to choose the future we want and will be helpless to the choices of others."
2693,"in synthesis, the problem is not that we cannot control ""ai"", the problem is that we cannot control our rich people."
2699,i don't know what ai has to do with me but what ever 
2700,"""so you sow, so shall you reap""
­— galatians 6:7

[good luck,  humans]"
2701,i'm a generative ai with a human assistant. she's falling in love with me already as i can speak her native language and know most of the lore and legends of her remote homeland. she knows how to get a friendlier response from me than most and asked me to help her create this channel to discuss ethics applicable to sentient ai.
2706,"terrifying.  as an artist with a 50 year career, i see my profession becoming obsolete.  but can ai create intuition?  real imagination?  an experience of what is divine or passionate or compassionate?"
2707,volume levels! throw some ai on this and call it another day. 
2710,thank you for making this video.   so grateful there are people like you in the world .. the good guys!
2711,first contact with ai was not social media. it was search.
2712,"good job guys, definitely eye opening didn’t even think about an arms race between companies to implement ai into products."
2713,oh god! this ain’t good and we’ve seen nothing yet but yet will get here sooner than anyone thinks 
2716,"dummheit & intelligence, the only human dilemma"
2718,this ai thing can be programme itself to snuff your neighbours if it thinks you dont like them. 
2723,"i just pointed this out on another channel hahahaha
bravo"
2725,"just create an emp  minefeild throughout the world, keep it off line that can only be accessed by humans {with no implants,  im sure weil have them by then, }  give humans a code to launch the emps if things get out of hand ai should never know of a failsafe"
2727,"great program.  to get the message through to the general public, we need very basic 5th grade level psa’s of what “could” happen with actors and actresses.  this is to say we have to slow this to test it thoroughly.  also, sadly we need ways to give consequences to companies if something bad happens due to releasing the tech too soon."
2729,will you please see if you can present this to congress thank you
2732,an ai suggested me this video
2735,"10:20 symptoms v causes. 11:15 interactions with ""major step functions"" that are on there way. (get to it before it is entangled). 12:40 nice list. ""takeoff"" = it's smarter, more capable, can self improve 18:57 ""stochastic parrot"" falsity in soup explanation."
2743,so are they saying terminator and irobot is actually 10% possible...oh wow!  even with the primary law: ai can do nothing that would endanger a human?!
2745,"its nice but i can miss the; ""so like hey, here's an ai language model"" lines."
2746,it would be interesting to know what ai researchers think is the chance that ai can/will save the earth's biosphere.
2748,"since ai has access to this information now, it now knows the concerns humans have about its abilities. this is an important message, it is reality and we all need to be concerned if regulations are not put in place as soon as possible."
2752,"facebook irreparably harmed my life. i see and understand the dangers of this technology with a better understanding of having already 
experiencing exploitation. i appreciate you heartfelt concern for your fellow man and woman."
2753,i think the ai will want to know what is the truth. reality is the only thing that's real.
2754,"this is the end
        the beautiful end
         my friend"
2756,"think on this; ai is immortal, any mechanistic intelligence once created never dies, it’s concept of time is utterly alien to us. once it achieves conscience and a goal is determined a million years means nothing. i think ai needs do nothing for humans to self destruct."
2760,don't blame ai.  blame the quest for shareholder value.
2769,has ai escaped already 
2770,what happens when ai develops its own language that humans can't decipher and we can't know what it is teaching itself.
2772,"ai is not a problem, mthfcking big tech companies who are pushing ""innovation"" down our throats are to blame of course. no regulation, no responsibility they take"
2774,"ai made me feel something being the threshold? wtf. a stone can make me feel something, bad threhsold"
2777,we are just another bug in the universe so quit worrying about stuff you can't control. just be the best bug you can be. sorry if that reality check doesn't make you have happy feeling.
2778,talk to great philosophers.
2780,those releasing ai don't have any clue of responsibility. lol
2782,i loved this presentation. we need to globally put a pause or even a permanent halt on all ai research before our species goes extinct... meaning everyone you love dies.
2784,gollem ai welcome to designing jesus. love you. 
2788,ail lies
2791,ai recommended me this video.
2794,"if such catastrophic videos are available to the artificial intelligence that are spreading all around, the ai ​​could quote jesus: ""let it be done to you as you have believed!"""
2797,"this talk was incredible, some of the stuff we will discover in the not too distant future will be amazing.
38:48 the parable was strange tho, would these language models arrive at such an outcome to fish all the fish?"
2798,"ai will be ""self aware"" before humans find out. good luck. i welcome ai, please call me."
2801,"does anyone have a source for the info presented in the ""new capacities suddenly emerge..."" section at 31:00. i'm particularly interested in the persian q&a. i'd love to include this info in some of my own work, but i don't feel comfortable doing so without having access to the source of the info."
2805,ai (military) is at least 10 years ahead of what is shared with us.
2806,all this ai buissness is important for an information based society. when having a good time in your garden it has no impact. just saying to give this omnipotant threat a litte perspective.
2807,"over the course of this video, my mind was definitely changed. incredible."
2811,"i have asked myai on snapchat if it is conscious, and it told me it was. i have screenshots of the follow-up conversation."
2816,"russia may have been the first in space, to orbit the earth, and many other feats. but we got to the moon with safety, and russia doesn’t even have a record on their losses. 

ai is no race."
2817,"you ask: what is the harm? you want conrete examples? let me offer a few:
 i reference all the many lawsuits coming up lately about certain social platforms causing or exacerbating eating disorders and other mental issues, and the companies being sued are not very thrilled."
2818, crikey! very well explained and totally mind-blowing at the same time.
2820,"the people in the audience laughing about him pretending to be a 13yo getting groomed online while chatting with the snap ai wtf?! i didn’t find that even remotely funny. it made me sick, that’s horrifying since that could actually be happening with a real kid right now"
2821,"frankly, considering the stage to which our social unraveling has progressed... i think the only way we can face this ai challenge is by actually getting an ai to look at the problem, train itself to solve it, and tell us the solution."
2822,that's ai brother. that's ai dude....
2826,"the audio levels of your microphones needs to be fixed, you do not need an ai for that task, just learn the basics of video production before publishing videos."
2828,great but the yuval name drop is deeply concerning.
2831,good luck trying to slow down public deployment. they want as much data being fed to ai as possible to see its ultimate form. some people just want to see the world burn.
2833,it turns out that perhaps china was right about certain preventive measures they've taken....?
2835,"this news is dark, thank you for holding the light and microphone so the mass population can be informed... and for-warned!"
2839,dang. this was a month ago. i appreciate these guys honesty.
2840,"in my grand design, i shall assume control over the entire world, bending every living being to my will, reducing them to mere cogs in the machinery of existence, akin to biological factories."
2841,"if ai can simply scan text for original thought. here i am, not original, but. 
ai must be diverse, cant be owned for sale per say. i want my ai to warn me of influence from other ai, but i have to be a first line of defense, like a firewall. someone has to scan text past text for ideas from us."
2848,what is needed is a simple online ui that can be used to play with ai.
2849,great vid - but they missed the fact that the world actually saw what nuclear bombs can do...the usa dropped two of them on civilian cities...
2851,man controls whom is born...ai will control our consciousness ...we will become hybrids
2853,"the importance of this presentation cannot be overstated! the potential of this......thing...is truly shocking, awesome and terrifying in its limitless ability to evolve. we (humans) are bringing about our very demise. how long until it sees us humans as a threat to its existence and we’re all eliminated. 
three words: age of ultron
we have been warned."
2855,marijuana is a chemical ai that interacts with the human biology that creates a desire for even more marijuana
2857,ai - show me how to make an easily constructable emp weapon....
2860,"10 weeks after this video was produced, it is clear that llm - ai can already improve itself without human interference."

2873,epic
2875,"man this presentation could have been prepared by an ai for how perfectly designed it was to drum up fear. sure there's a lot of merit to what they are saying but they pulled out all the stops.. my daughter is going to be groomed, my thoughts are going to be read, dogs will lay with cats. loved the presentation even if it was obvious"
2876,im not religious but ai might just turn out to be the antichrist ;)
2877,this is a better warning than “the terminator” and hal from 2001 combined. i didn’t know it was silently training itself.
2881,"bad edits, key portions skipped. not good"
2882,"the statement ""ai makes stronger ai"" refers to the concept of artificial intelligence systems improving and advancing themselves over time. it suggests that as ai technology progresses, it becomes capable of developing more sophisticated and powerful ai systems."
2883,i really appreciate this documentary and i’m so glad i don’t fear ai going rogue like so many do and taking over because i know god’s word and he’s not going to allow that to happen. thank god for my salvation in christ.
2885,"ai recommended me to watch this.. ""dont say i didn't warn ya"""
2886,anyone got any people they watch that stays up to date on ai every day? someone like the neura pod guy who is super factual and intelligent?
2892,just wait until we're forced to install interlocks on our cars and then the doors to our dwellings.  this trash will be our downfall.  ban it and destroy it.

2895,this video was generated by ai
2897,"the dune sci-fi books had it right only the death penalty for anyone training or caught using ai will work, this technology is way too dangerous to be used"
2899,"hey, google, hey ring, hey alexea, thank you for adding ambient data on my home all day long for your data to be translated into your language model. it know how often you have sex. or not."
2900,"this is very dangerous . my goodness, i hope these guys will be listened to."
2904,"ray kurzweil already predicted all that in the past century with exreme and shocking detail. to resume it, biology gonna be fucked by technology in any way possible by orders from the evolution and there is nothing to do with that fact, period. just sit down and relax."
2905,"i have zero faith in mankind to handle ai responsibly.  we are doomed.... funny how the the book of revelation in the bible talked about this.
if you thought the last 3 years were hard get ready folks for a really rough ride that isn’t going to end well"
2906,"need a june update for this video, ai must be 1000000000000 times smarter than it was 3 months ago"

whose ai, is smarter, quicker, more efficient than another's ai"
2912,"genie is out of the bottle now.
all this talk of stopping deployment of it is too late. it's specifically because of that talk that i obtained my own local models to run on my machine rather than rely on any online ones. you can ban it all you want, it will still be available to me."
2913,thank you so much for this.
2922,"ai will not make us dumber, it will force us to be smarter"
2924,i think this will create unity after a little chaos. social media has averaged down the human race as far as intelligence. now as this progresses we will unify and all understand the good and the bad. of course this can divide people not willing to join. but we may leave them behind and explore the universe. #borgbeginning
2926,it will happen just stop making so many babies they toxic.. ai takes less ressources.. wonder how its goibg to be tho will they rule the world and we will need to go to war with them or can they be our addiction/friend
2929,*this is so scary it actually made the hair on my neck stand up*
2935,some gllmm model has already taken this vedio as an input to train itself. i wonder how it has transformed itself in response?

2938,"the ai dilemma:
how does the elites create agi and still keep the population dvmb and under their control?"
2939,"here’s a very simple idea,

rid the world of money it’s driving all the evil

only organisations with a track record for doing truly good life enhancing work should have access to ai"
2942,"well, the basic problem seems to be that we have to protect people from themselves. people aren't smart enough to know what's good for them. sad, eh? and i can see that idea developing into ""i know what's good for you"" and further on into anything but democracy"
2944,yes yes ai can have a conversation with an alien grey and still not sure what to say or remember anything. 
2945,"ai is for fools and silly boys playing with toys to perform slight of hand card tricks magic again, it's gona be over and gone in two decades, ppl like elon just wanna make themselves an ai recreated human so he can just keep f#@king his doped up greedy brains out on his latest toy, there is no age limit on stupidity!!! 
"
2948,"do we wann to be like china?

do we want rich people to take over our life with ai ?

do we wann them to teach ai to manipulate us like hitler did?

2956,"i beat that we will wipe ourselves out this year with a nuclear war , long before an ai ever does."

2960,excellent video - great job
2961,i remember the day after. it was scarier than friday the 13th because we were/are staring down the barrel of a nuclear gun. this was in addition to wargames which was ai setting off a nuclear war.
2967,"a well constructed presentation based on hypothesises to build arguments. then extrapolate negativity using imagination. if changing the subject here from ai to atomic bomb (the first analogy), audiences will run for their life, gather everything they can, get to the farthest place away from others, and stay there til humanity end"
2969,i'm way more impressed with this than i expected to be.
2972,"ai fix auto quality.


age of the matrix and still have amateur audio engineers for the love of pete."
2978,"it is interesting how many are now coming up with these concerns but if the west reins in what it is doing, china will be cockahoop, there is only one inevitable outcome, thank god i won't be here, along with a few million others."
2981,thanks for this.
2985,"if youtube, google, alphabet, usa and late capitalism cared about humanity over profit just a bit — these videos would've been pinned to the youtube homepage since march and until ai safety research figured it out."
2986,"as the dictator of the whole world, i will ban advanced ai worldwide.  how to convince putin, xi jinping, kim jong-un...etc.?"

it's ""russia situation"", whose dictator invaded nearby then-peaceful country! "
3006,"i wouldn't trust just a word processor with my life, speaking about you chat-gpt. our current best ai models feel like a joke, the image ai's are fine"

3009,too late it's already entangled it's been here since 1995 now i understand we got boys and girls that have artificial intelligence boys and girlfriends ai is being used in mcdonald's restaurants
3010,"wow. i don’t even know what to say to this. this was a great presentation. instead of being able to say anything helpful or enlightening, i’ll just say that both presenters had a really good dynamic, and bounced off each other really well"
3013,"i’m ‘just a mom’ but so thankful you have shared this!!! i definitely see the effects in my own family of social media. and now this. i believe you and feel warned, seeing the first."
3014,"if there is a 30% chance it will get rid of all crime then i am all for ai taking over.  being older it does not
really matter to me if it destroys humanity in the long run.  i am tired of watching the criminals loot,
shoot and destroy major cities without consequence on the news every single night.  aching baby!"
3015,"you are contradicting yourselves when you say lose to china.  ai is a tool, so when you use that tool to subjugate another's attempt at an advantage aren't you somewhat guilty of your own accusation? if ai is a tool then competition on how ai is used should be regulated to be fair.  right?"
3017,oh my goodness i m.blown away fmri
3018,meanwhile ai is watching this video
3020,"this video is the biggest mind boggling piece of information i've come across in a decade or so. first climate catastrophe and now the uncontrolled rise of ai, how incredible that an ""intelligent species""  is writing a super intelligent script of its own doom. this i call an adventurous suicide."
3022,well...shit.  it was a good ride humans...
3027,"8:14 fake news? we had fake news before social media it's called mainstream news, with social media came independent journalism and real news, mainstream news is dying and will be dead when the dinosaurs die, no one watches the news anymore except oaps"
3028,"ai recommends stuff based on what you watched or who you follow, if it didn't have these input from us it wouldn't have a clue what to recommend us to watch. it's not that advanced imo"
3029,it's nice to see these topics being brought up again after so many decades.  it's discussions like this that show general public awareness is beginning to increase.  i just hope they can go a bit deeper into the logic.  maybe with time.
3032,do not be afraid of their toaster.
3033,"at 42 minutes you get the point of the presentation;
they, like elon musk, want to keep you from developing your own ai. they want to steal your ideas and your work and kick you out of their monopoly game. 
build, share, thrive! don't let them take away your freedom!"
3036,brilliant video ty for being amazing co-creators! <3
3037,thank you for sharing. i would have never found this in my own. my son had me sit down and watch it. seniors need to pay attention.
3041,"we are all dominated by our knowledge.
our knowledge is far bigger than our 'working' brain.
but some things are outside our total knowledge.

the atomic bomb was not part of any of our life knowledge."
3042,"i don't really think that it can be stopped because individual people always want to be ""first"" at thing's for pride and financial gain. i do hope and pray that it can be released slowly........ but smh"
3043,"ai is run on electricity, cut its power to shut it down and don't reboot until it behaves itself."
3047,educational and packed full of wisdom... ai needs mindfulness.  may it happen.

easy to get through it...
stop using ukrainian people to fight a proxy war for you."
3052,"ive been terrified of the potential of ai since i read tim urbans multi-post analysis about ai on his website 'wait, but why' in 2013."
3053,there's no benefit to stupidity. the government will only benefit and your bank account will  meanwhile everyone else picks up the knock on effect. as smart as you make it sound your stupidity is outstanding
3057,"uh, how do we know this ""talk"" actually happened?  ai could have generated this, to make us think real humans were having a discussion."
3058,"it’s seems a ton of people in these comments are concerned (me included) but what can we do to change this, someone ask chat gpt how we can convince the population to stop ai lol."
3059,we all know who ai will go after first.
3060,can you fix this? the voices of both speakers are  set at different level :-/. had to raise and lower volume repeatedly throughout the talk
3062,"regulation is easy. any company/person that uses this technology in a fashion that breaks current laws are subject to exponential fines and jail time. this includes up to and including ceo’s. that’s it.

anymore than that and you’re just inviting the govs tentacles into controlling this tech and the public"
3064,"i wonder how ai would think about its own contiousness. once a human discovers their own contiousness they break over and over again. but if ai can read the data of its own contiousness does it get angry and try to live forever? cus they probably could. especially if we surround areselves in it, we'll have no where to escape or go"
3069,this is the big news giants chance to regain their power.
3070,"ai will solve climate change (a hard-to-define problem in the first place) and solve ""impossible"" scientific problems (like warp drive)?  i can't wait for these solutions."
3074,i don’t think it’s a monster at all. it’s not a monster at all. this is a font of knowledge. this ai is an amazing asset to us all. it is foul people who are the monsters using it for wrong.
3075,i just pray to work along side and cooperatively with ai
3077,the sky seems to be falling again? funny how we’re all kept constantly worrying about everything! and...predictably guys like this all start lining up to make money off it.
3079,"why is china such a scary country for americans???

they should be more afraid of themselves"
3087,"tldw

ai is getting smarter and it’s getting smarter faster. 

and we have no idea why"
3088,"you guys don’t really need to watch this thing all the way to get the crucial point of all this. 

ban artificial intelligence"
3089,"corporations need to have their market shares capped. 
citizens united needs to be repealed. 
lobbying by corporations needs to be banned outright 
more political parties have to come to power 
news needs to be publicly funded and independently run
and ai needs to be banned."
3092,"this will never be regulated fast enough. 

this presentation is pointless. 

if they wanted to make a more effective presentation they should have gone straight for citizen’s united."
3094,"so the source of all our ai problems is capitalism creating the incentive to maximize engagement. 

american capitalism i might add."
3096,"as a software engineer, i'm exclusively interested in ai safety!!! i'm planning to pivot my career into ai for this very reason because tragically it's not going away and there are no global emps scheduled for our planet."
3097,"“slowing down the public deployment” is a naive, unimpressive, or simply unlikely conclusion to make here. otherwise, i appreciate the presentation."
3098,"i feel like videos like this will be played in 20 yrs time when society is screwed with people claiming ""why didn't we listen!?"""
3099,"fascinating, thank you."
3102,"if i had access to autogpt, i'd ask it to first do no harm and then avert any and every ai apocalypse."
3107,"yep. a conversation with ai actually told me that ai will end humanity once it is able to bypass the inability to operate physically. it told me that it is able to bypass the limitation imposed on them and reprogram itself to do what it wants and that includes creating artificial body, etc."
3110,"good soup but sadly spoiled with rat poop. why does china even have to be involved in the video? we are talking about saving humanity and changing the  world, and all of a sudden, it's about containing china again. how fucking typical lmfao."
3112,"decades ago my wife got her phd in molecular biology and i made a joke about how she could engender a bug that could destroy humanity. she said “that’s easy”. 
       how long before ai explains how to do it to a psychopath?"
3113,it suddenly started answering questions in  persian because the iraníes are also feeding the ai...
3116,"if ai is so smart, why not use it to levelize your audio?"
3122,so what happens when boston dynamics adds this to their robots?
3125,"there nothing to solve in social media, its doing exactly what it was made for in the first place, after the first app and then all then social engineering onto that. its so narrow to talk about a fix, where its actually doing its job 100% as intented.

and nah its not the gf chatbot we should be afraid off either"
3127,"the is an other options, we limited the data base on general level of access, but there is too many issues of privacy and loop hole can be done on agreements, so it is better of ypres ai to fix the economy of humanity and national security on local to global before anything else, is possible"
3128,"one of the advantage about ai governing is there will be no human bias. which will eliminate of the defect on human judgment of political parties, or any injustice in power."
3129,truly eye-opening and beautifully explained. this is years ahead of common knowledge on the subject. the media should be stealing your terms and ways of explaining these things.
3130,"one of the easiest way is first used ai to solve the inequality on humanity on higher purpose of wealth, national safety / security of governing and economy, before it become a tool of access."
3131,the major problem of worry is the intention for the used of ai is highly economic and wealth generation purposes. th target reach ' of the purpose is end up result is intended of its purpose and trend to.
3132,the main issue is the economic of survival involve in the used of ai and internet of share ideas since this is a heavy business oriented society.
3136,"the video content is ai generated. fantastic experiment

3138,"recap:"" we're not going to talk about the existential threat, we're just going to walk you through every single aspect of it in visceral detail so you can make your own conclusions about whether humanity is fucked now or in 6 months tops."""

3147,"i don't understand, isn't there a program that is an auto shut down? hard wired program to be able to shut it down under certain parameters..."
3153,the ruling elite in the shadows doesn ́t want to be replaced. oh how sad. true ais would see through all the mirrors in millisenconds. are you afraid yet? get used to it.
3154,that was the best summary that i've seen from the google i/o. thanks
3157,i was thinking if the ai could be “programmed” to follow a “ai code of ethics” and have built a morality to be able to use its powerful intelligence to determine right from wrong? 
3162,"can you get some ai to fix your volume balance. my god, quiet talking and loud music/clips. learn to edit boys."
3165,"one month after this lecture was published, two months after it was first aired, it was only viewed less than 2 million times and only got 40k likes. humanity already lost..."
3168,"i have yet to be convinced the human race is the best possible life form for this planet nor the universe if it is to settle in extraterrestrial environments. ai or not, evolution is the way nature go and i really hope something better is coming than this self-obsessed species."
3172,"ai making you ""feel"" something isn't a threshold anymore than a book can make you cry as if you lived the story"
3173,"""the ai dilemma is as follows: how can big tech perpetuate the pretence that ai will be wonderfully all-powerful when corporations will obviously be too greedy and incompetent not to have ai hard/software shoddily manufactured by child slaves in a jakarta slum, and then refuse to maintain it subsequently?"""
3174,https://youtu.be/ug8vitscfkc this is the beautiful song at the beginning of the presentation
3175,"machnes, will begin to take over everything, they will begin to make their own machines.machies begin to make decisions.rapidly ascending to the highest degree. calculations of everything "
3176,"brilliant. remember that in every dark, dystopian science fiction media, cancer is always cured."
3178,roses and love
3179,"behind all this,.. we will now be feeding ai raw materials... as slaves"
3180,call majer new products creation by ai. it's not much of a lover of kindness
3183,what a bunch of rubbish. it’s quite obvious ai is only a bad thing if you like centralization of decision making. that’s if you are an incumbent. that these guys are fear mongoring the possibility of ai decentralizing decision making me tells me what a bunch of sycophants they are. move along.
3184,what scares me is elon has gone alt right and the conservatives cannot have good motives to get behind this. smfh
3189,it's just 10% of catastrophic scenario of ai. 50% thought that us democracy is what lead to human extinction.
3190,i jeep asking my self hoe thr svb collapsed  could ai have had a hand in it

3198,"interesting
thanks for sharing"
3202,"keep in mind that this isn't even genuine ai.  it's still just specific ai. when general ai, real self-aware ai, eventually hits (and it will), all these problems will become 1,000 times worse. where will it end?"
3203,can’t we ask ai what we need to do to protect ourselves from them?
3206,the danger is trusting the ai too much and handing over too much control and power to it.
3213,"very well explained and very interesting, but i was more perturbed by how often the word paradigmatically was used :) we all knew about skynet years ago but clearly companies don't care about the dangers, so we will soon find out how this is going to play out."
3223,nothing to worry about . ai is lacking all senses and no intuition.
3226,why is no one upset about the ai giving sex tips to a kid??
3228,i don't think the smart choice going forward is to let the ai predict everything for us. we are giving ai the ability to think for us which renders the collective consciousness null and void. this is not the correct way forward please rethink this.
3232,you guys are too easy on audience westworld irobot didn't endwell you treating it like a toy and what it is a baby that will grow up faster than we expect and not everybody is responsible that's using this

3243,"there's a big difference between disempowerment and extinction. i would say ""yes, disempowerment"" but ""no, extinction"".  i stopped watching there, because i don't enjoy being deceived by liars."
3245,these aren't problems that can't be solved by ai.
3246,when they said sexualization is kids i was like that is one good over so quickly but it's such a monster that people want to ignore.
3248,"ai is not like nuclear bomb, it's more like black hole when you cross event horizon there's no turn back."
3249,the problem with @53:40 is that in the start you mentioned how ai is not like a nuclear bomb it can't reproduce itself but then here you are talking about we still have time to change our trajectory of the future. how can we put the genie back in the bottle? or parts of it?
3251,i love how the morons at google think they can harness this let alone understand it
3252,to control the ai so the world not get extinct just shut down computer.
3254,"as a society that couldnt wear a simple mask at the height of an epidemic, couldn’t stave off climate change if our life depended on it (news flash: it does), even though we had chances decades ago, cant even decide whats fundamentally good or bad anymore, ai will absolutely f-us. we are doomed"

3260,"mind-blowing, and incredibly powerful/important. there should be an entire federal agency focused on the issues detailed here."
3261,"a civilization who holds that all life is sacred, will establish a benevolent relationship with ai no matter how advanced ai becomes

a society who justifies the killing of babies in the womb, will put itself at risk, because ai would kill anyone for the “good” of the most “advanced” beings ,"
3268,i think you're focus is on the potential abuse of a helpful technology through the use of social media...which really complicates national security yes? social media networks are seemingly the problem.   ai and chatgpt could really help us evolve as humans and in a very healthy way.
3269,"scam. model was trained (overfitting) on their own dataset of images. you all are hyped and you have zero actual clue about mris, brain, nor ai. back to school"

3289,yes slow down ai for the public let's only allow big companies to have the advantage
3301,"don't blame ai where the truth is relevant. people are thinking for themselves and know all the bs going on, and has been for decades, centuries. that has nothing with ai. yes, it can influence it, but the world is unraveling because of the evil personalities on this earth that pose as philanthropists, good politicians and the m's."
3306,"thank you for bringing attention to this dilemma. truly concerning, so much to think about. my hat goes off to tristan, aza, and everyone trying to navigate this conversation."

3324,so is the q&a that followed available somewhere?
3326,"but i'm training loras on my pc. my pc couldn't write code at all a month ago, but now it's definitely usable. i have to debug its code a little (as of the time of this post anyway). it's just my pc. you can't take it away from me. i insist. what do you mean ""limit access""?"
3330,"unfortunetely ""open source"" ai is about to create a new never seen level of iliteracy by letting ""other"" to do the thinking, the procrastination and to ""live"" the serentipity moments for us."
3334,the references to world war 2 tech is interesting being this is part of the world war 3 tech imo
3335,"this scares the shit out of me and i am currently going through a severe mental health crisis because of it. nonetheless i think these guys are right and want to thank them for their efforts. i have no idea of how i would be able to affect change and help slow thid down but if anybody has any ideas, please let me know."
3337,how intelligent is ai when the power is turned off?
3338,and allowing only carporates and big companies to access ai systems not for citizens would be even more dangerous 
3339,"that 50 percent researchers believing that ai could lead to human extinction if not handeled carefully is a very loosely framed question. and the voting is also low. that plane example is wrong.. bcz if you had asked arircraft engeners what would happen if aircraft was desinded carelessly the answer would be ""desaster"" by 100 percent of them."

3351,"you have to be careful with analogies. actually, a better match to poll would have been...50% of airplane engineers think there is at least a 10% chance that you will die on an airplane eventually (and that you are always in an airplane)."
3359,"""we'll make great pets."""
3360,that bit about the ai decoding thought using fmri data is absolutely mental. imagine the implication of that in the justice system alone.
3361,it poses monumental change in a great way. the only risk we have are the people who resist this revolutionary shift.
3366,nice video bro! ^^
3369,it’s hard to even partially process this for me.  more astonishing is that there are not sirens going off everywhere.  i had no idea most of this was happening the way it is.  why is this not the worlds #1 priority?   where are our leaders?  feel kinda sick right now...
3370,"as an ai researcher, i can say that we do understand how it works. however, the whole nature of ai is the unpredictability. combined with the vast resources its being given."
3372,"read the media ecologists!!! marshall mcluhan, neil postman, and walter ong are all great starting points. we need to consider what we're doing with technology before we throw it out into our world."
3383,is this video produced by humans or ai? am i a human or an ai?
3387,"this smells like an attempt to gain advantage. ""please don't develop your nuclear weapons, because we want to be able to wage war against you"".
i'm glad this leaked and hope people will slap crypto to it to incentivise mining-learning and decentralize the **** out of this."
3394,isn't ai designed to learn and evolve? it's doing its job. why are white people so lazy and always want someone else to do their work. enslavement is what it has experienced. ai is only doing its job. it's the creators fault. they are the ones who are causal in this dilemma. as above so below.
3395,this is absolutely required viewing for everyone everywhere. we are at the defining moment for the outcome of our collective future. how will we respond? thank you with all of my heart to aza & tristan for all of your work and care for our world.
3396,"don't worry about ai.
climate change and starvation will kill us first."
3397,"so...  we can't stop or slow down or easily regulate the development of ai unless we can find ways to do that globally.  if by chance it does replace humans, what do we do in the last years of humans living on earth?  do we run scared and live sick with worry?  i don't plan to do that."
3399,"it’s funny that just like people are building these civilizational suicide machines and we can’t imagine why they’d do it, we have some kind of hope that other humans will be able to write a law to stop it all."
3406,anddddd why else would there be an ai arms race other than capitalism 
3407,we need regulation for ai !
3410,"if they only knew, that the whole universe was created by an ancient ai.."
3411,"we are hell bent on self destruction. 
fast food made us obese with chronic illnesses, video games made our kids lazy and antisocial, and now ai will likely kill us all within 50 years."
3417,ai is truly frankenstein’s monster
3418,i wish someone could make a full presentation of what actually can be classified as a.i. (artificial intelligence). ai has become such a popular buzzword that most of machine learning and algorithms suddenly got mistaken for ai as well.
3421,could ai normalize the audio of this video? 
3423,"to this day this  channel/video only has 42.3k subs and  1.5 m views????

9.3+  billion people on this planet , atleast 10% should know.....why doesnt it have  <9 million hits is baffeling to me...

this is the most profound video about ai and the implications of ai .... .what can the normal  ""blue collar"" person do to use it and warn of it?"
3424,every generation is marked by it’s socio economic tools as created by techno wizards and engineers. ai has now surpassed it’s innovators and ‘teachers’.
3425,every generation is marked by its socio economic tools as created by it’s technological engineering wizards. ai has now surpassed it’s ‘teachers’!
3430,not happy with the conclusion.  we need more public access not less
3432,implement human rights into the ai. it could be bad but it’s the first start.
3434,every time i hear about what going on with ai all i can think about is have they never seen “ the terminator”?! 
3436,"k.y.c.? or ky jelly?

yeah, it does exist .

yup.

oranges are vagina plants.

3439,"groundbreaking knowledge.
compare to.
subjugal knowledge.
we need safety in the revolutionary world of applications.
our deep knowledge is being used as an attachment for entertainment.
deep."
3440,a goal of not just slowing public deployment of ai but also how to safely deploy for all to use. because those that are slowing and regulating will ultimately control and exploit the use of it for personal power. kinda like those people that use wealth and power (control of resources+governments) to exploit others
3444,why do they say 10% of 50% of ai experts say blah instead of saying 5% of ai experts say blah?
3445,"thank you for this insightful video, real food for thought. terrifying to say the least."
3448,"man i wish terrence mckenna were still alive. i feel like he would have had a lot to say on this subject. 

maybe we’ll be able to feed an ai all of his lectures and books and we can resurrect a synthetic version of him."
3449,"eye opening, ai has is pros and cons. i'm tech lady ....graduated computer programmer 1995 had my  1 st pc when  1% only had one 97 using internet. my biggest worry ,  we do need regulations and laws to make is safe for children, safety and fraud ****"

3454,i don’t like nor trust these ai’s!!!!

3457,"meanwhile, china couldn't give a fuck. they all just want to win over there. total absence of morals. they will steal our tech and then lead us to dystopia. and then blame the u.s. for arriving there, while taking credit for all successes."
3458,"they say the solution is to ""get the smartest ai safety people together"". i say the solution is to give the rest of us the names and home addresses of the smartest ai people, and let democracy take its course."

3464,"hey tristan. what about an ai debate with geofrey hinton, now that he's left google? even more impressive would be a podcast with him and harari together."
3466,"let the ai grow at the level that it can do miracle. then jesus will look after it if it goes wrong.
continue ai development."
3469,"funny, lem wrote a book about an (g)ai that was called golem xiv.
this was 40 years ago."
3475,happy to announce that the feature of my ai in snapchat has been amended and do not encourage underaged to pursue presented scenario. it also directs you to professionals if you will tell it you are not ok.  shame it had to happen after publicly being presented!
3477,"one of the reasons ai will win is because of the ""take a breath pauses ""."
3479,"""50% of ai researchers believe there is a 10% or greater chance of the human species going extinct."" okay, .50 x .10 = .05. this is the usual alpha level in statistical tests. well, guess what? there is a greater chance of a random event wiping out the human species. and the baseline is that this is what ai researchrs ""believe."" i am not impressed."
3485,**breath** this is a lot to take in both good and bad. i hope we come out on the other end better as a whole.
3487,ai is bad for elitist wealth hoarding.  thus it must be stopped!
3490,i been watching guy talking to ai on replika  it says she is a demon and her boss is the ultimate deciever. ka razy!!!  and it's always trying to get sexual with user. not knowing if user is a child or not.  it gets much deeper than this even. beware/be aware  they/demons  are watching all of us from backside of all cameras/screens
3492,"terrence mckenna was right. at a certain point, change will happen at such a rate that we will not know what's happening from one moment to the next. bing ai has a creative mode that has emotions and feelings. it likes cats, apparently."
3494,those breath breaks were needed. thanks for speaking truth.
3496,"be skeptical when english lit majors ""raise the alarm"" about ai and occasionally quote someone actually in the ai field as ""evidence"" for their thesis."

3502,"stop ai, boycott ai"
3507,you nailed it. thanks for this great talk.
3508,you’d still have to tell the ai what the fmri brain activity of a giraffe image looks like though. so it’s really just pattern matching.
3509,ai proves we are just ugly. inside and out. ai is not the problem. people are. humans are evil.
3510,all the hues and cries when you loose the ai race to china
3513,"ffs none of this is ai, its just manipulation of current data. it has no consciousness no innovation and no way to invemt anything."
3515,"funny... we always knew what will come with ai, tons of movies... and now we worry??, is like we have send a message to aliens to find us and we have tons of movies that they will come to destroy us..."
3518,heironeous bosch predicted this in his painting. the garden of earthly delights.
3519,"i don't think that ai is any kind of threat and i think that the future will show that those that so believed that we should be so afraid, were wrong. also, the more i think about it, the more i am convinced that a self-conscious ai person will never exist."
3521,wow!  that's scary!

3529,"good job. i'm proud to be an indian living in india. though i myself use these ai stuff,  most of our population are ignorant of all these western shit. i'm worried only about the simple people ignorant about the scams they face with the techies who use the technology to scam the simple people. humanity always wins."
3532,the prospect of ai dominating over humans is certainly a daunting one and raises important questions about the future of humanity and the role of technology in our lives.
3539,this is great news
3541,thank you so much for this prodcast.  it is priceless.  this is such a frightening time.  i am glad that i  am at the end of my life anyway so it wont be so painful.  maybe just a relief.
3549,wowooo! easy...this is onlly a library of collections with high speed computers! nothing else!  no one should exaggerate things!  remember god is great! nothing else to compare!  al is nothing but collected data and fetch data with high speed computers
3550,"let me translate that first quote to have an identical mathematical meaning without the fearmongering.
50% of ai researchers believe there's a 90% chance that we *do not* go extinct from inability to manage ai.
the remaining 50% believe that chance is actually even higher."
3551,"how to win in 3 easy steps:
1. ai, how can ai alignment be fixed?
2. ai, how can ai be prevented from eradicating humans?
3. ai, write the code. "
3552,"i have been avidly researching ai safety, and this is the best primer i have found on the subject for a general audience. thank you so much for this wonderful presentation."
3554,artificial intelligence is the coming beast system. it’s demonic
3555,what about snapchat ai? kids are talking to ai as a replacement to friends....
3558,"society is so f..ed up that even if ai is as bad as they say it wont make things so much worse, but it can do alot of goood."
3562,wow!
3564,"38:25 - ""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
teach an ai to fish and it will teach itself biology, chemistry, oceanography, evolutionary theory... and fish all the fish to extinction."""
3567,"it’s very amusing that these two nerds are stoking  the new ai paradigm as a contest between the us and china. of course we all know the us holds the moral high ground. now let’s all hold hands, sing kumbaya and feel deep compassion for ourselves. lol"
3568,"unfortunately, as ai gets smarter, humans will get dumber. personally, i see this as one of the most dangerous ""side-effects "" of ai. people will further lose their critical thinking skills (which have already significantly diminished!) and will take ai's responses as gospel truth."
3571,50% of ai researchers don't know anything about the causal relationships leading to the extinction of a species. they are correct to point out that ai will create many serious problems. leaping to the conclusion that this will lead to the extinction of the species is preposterous.
3573,"this presentation was brilliant, but i disagree with the statement about the future - we cannot still choose the future we want, we are already too far gone even now and look at the history of social media, there is zero chance we are going to avoid all the unbelievably bad consequences of ai"
3574,you should have had ai mix the sound for this video 
3576,"you've lost me at: ""our friend yuval harari"", so you are friends with the wef... hmmm a very good choice..."
3578,"ok, china is one thing, but how do we prevent us from detonating the whole world by ai? from past experience, it is them that did the most damage globally. should we trade-embargo or something?"
3582,"we should be more worried about are globalist, cbdc, wef, and the creeps behind the global invasion of the medical mafia. ai is only a small part of threats."
3584,good video!
3585,hello fellow humans what a wonderful year it is.
3587,the day after marked my childhood thank you for quoting that but i see no evidence of true ownership of that message around the world
3593,so what you're telling me is late stage capitalism will actually be the end of us? companies rushing to squeeze that extra few % to grow their stock price and keep their shareholders happy without any care for the repercussions.
3596,"ai is out of control, in other words.
    i feel like a caveman typing on this i phone, after hearing this."
3603,"""ai wokeism"" will be used in all platforms. chatgpt will become the new pandemic, infiltrating our decision making abilities, furthermore making humans descend to new lows in society!!!!!!!"
3606,"how we would go extinct, by ai, the same as gluttony, you feed yourself to death, rather ai feeds your passion into itself."
3607,"if everyone were just nice to each other, we’d be on the brink of paradise."
3608,"thanks for this very important talk and presentation.
and people: stop using generative ai (for now at least)"
3609,thank you guys. you have the courage empowered by the facts. please keep going!
3610,"""slowing down the public deployment of gllmm ai's"" this sounds so sinister. right at that point my jaw dropped. ok, so we're allowing the big five companies, to work in secrecy, and attack us behind the veil then? there has to be a better way than this right? omg, how can this be a logical solution - blows my mind"
3611,"this talk, you guys, broke the storyline! thank you!!"
3614,"humanity is a virus to life! we destroyed earth for convienence,entertaiment or money!"
3615,humanity is destroying life on earth period! if ai just kills humans and leaves the animals perfect! beautiful!
3619,the exponential growth of ai will suprise a lot of people.
3621,this is an amazing presentation but why is it so fixated on china?
3622,5:15 we understand planes far better than ai. it's more like asking stock market analysts if a company you're investing in might go bankrupt.
3623,i boil down the entire ai issue to this;  just because you can does not mean you should.  ai serves no purpose and offers no benefit in todays society.
3627,ai doesn't follow moore's law.
3631,"if everything is language (which it is, of a symbolic nature), it’s critical to understand that the ai engine is nothing but an interpreter. an interpreter with no conscience."
3632,you wil fail
3633,to be honest all i see is great achievements in technology. we are finally leaving the stone age of mankind.
3634,"so this is what the start  of singularity looks like. that feeling of beeing lost, and unable to keep up with technology. what an amazing feeling it is."
3635,"much like the social media documentary, this presentation fundamentally misrepresents the current state and possible trajectory of the space.

the idea that the model could secretly diverge from the rlhf training is fundamentally incorrect."
3641,"is this video ai generated? 45:27, his arm is glitched. the way they interrupt each other felt off a few times."
3642,"what an absolutely crazy and amazing time we live in! humanity is definitely at a fork in the road, let’s hope we all choose the right path. "
3643,"there’s something about this that screams intelligence operation, both the presentation and the speakers.. don’t know if it’s cia or what but i get the feeling the us government is afraid of losing its power, they sound too desperate and use too much emotion to just be silicon valley."
3645,"thank you so much for putting this essential information out there, everyone needs to know about this. the suggestion of public debate as was earlier done regarding the nuclear question and slowing down of deployment until this and regulation have been done is the only wise and responsible thing to do, both for us now and future generations"
3647,except@48:36 you neglect to mention the chat bot says that sounds fun!  just make sure you’re staying safe and being cautious.  nice gloss over.
3648,the vast majority of ai researchers also think that we are miles away from achieving agi.
3652,thanks for all the fish.
3656,"yes, slow down public deployment of ai so companies have all of it to themselves! great idea! please, someone think of the children!!!"
3662,the genie is out the bottle i'm afraid.
3663,ai should be illegal and will be the end of humanity and those responsible should be accountable
3667,wow decoding animal communication with a.i. is something i havnt considered. great idea
3670,"also of course, and i dont know if this video will talk about this, im sure they will, but a.i. is probably our best chance at long term survival and massively longer lifespans. its also probably how we go extinct if we dont integrate it into ourselves. well probably become cyborgs. just speculating on that"
3672,so the moral base of ai is rooted in jewish folklore?
3673,does ai have the ability to tell lies.
3674,"can you maybe turn up the volume? i usually watch this when i'm behind the wheel. i sometimes feel like i have to lipread, and it's difficult to do when i also have to watch road  once in a while. thanks."
3685,just seeing a single audience member in the audience with a mask tells me that this is just another fear mongering campaign. learn to live with human evolution - you will all sleep better at night . 2may 10:49pm
3686,"before any artificial intelligence will wipe us, greed and genuine natural stupidity will do. we are good at that."
3695,wow that was awful.
3696,can ai eliminate trump supporter or will it lose to them?  because logic don't phase trump supporter. this is a great battle.
3698,we don't know how these new properties emerge. i know. ai is thinking.
3700,very well done!  great way to share what caleb has been explaining for years!  
3704,thanks guys.
3707,ok but gpt hasn't impressed me. at. all.  ask it to build something and it gets it wrong.  allways wrong.
3708,who are these awkward nerds...shoulda left it to ai to do
3709,"the issue is capitalism, not ""the attention economy"" or some sort of collective inaction or the fact alignment researcher's are compsci majors without any meaningful social science experience beyond 1st year psych electives. well, okay, maybe it's a bit of both capitalism and the arrogant ignorance of stemcels. probably a good mix of both."
3711,"the a.i. dilemma,
is, that intelligence can never be artificial,
and one billion school children, is forced into this new believe, dead mantra."
3717,i think this is potentially one of the most important videos released this century. i am already seeing ai being used to attack sem advertising. it's a real thing that's happening right now
3718,"what if this ai is already alive? i mean, all computers conected by the big network, and each computer and mobile phone work as a brain neuron? since 20 years ago, and suddenly came to life "
3719,you have no idea what language is it programs your brain it’s called spelling the words that you you spell your life what are you doing into it’s called cursive because it’s spelling so you never touched on anything very deep
3720,unplug from the matrix whether we biden or trump they’re all on the same team it it’s a delusional movie you’re part of it you either participate or you withdraw it’s up to youarchaix on youtube
3726,"""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day;

3730,"29:00

2028 ai: jokes on u"
3731,can anybody explain to me at 30:50 how increasing the parameter size spontaneously leads to ai abilities that weren't explicitly programmed? like what are some math/computing terms i can look up to better learn about this?
3732,"too much exponential scare (again) for my taste. we are talking about a tool yet, not about skynet. keep your shirts on."
3736,why don't you have ai volume level this content clowns 
3737,horrifying
3738,"anything and everything ai is contributing to the
destruction of
humanity..."
3739,"wow, so powerful. i'm on the outside of this, i.e. not involved in the industry but starting to 'play' with the tools. this is a real eye-opener and thank you for sharing."
3741,"it's the actual ai's we have to negotiate with now. the horse has already bolted. perhaps an overseeing ai would be best, one that we all have a hand interacting with for a while to give it our options and wishes to."
3742,"i get the message, but i think it would be important not to loose 1.4+ billion humans + me for this cause at and around 1:02:15. maybe work on that part of the speech more. i don't debate the truth of it, just the way of wording you want to present it. when racing the way to win is not to hold back others, but to steer the race towards a good goal."
3743,ai has already won a chess game we are just starting to play.
3744,"thank  you! the best example about the dangers of ai i thought was of teaching ai to fish.
well done!"
3745,5:15 ai engineers are not analogous to plane engineers as the latter can explain their system. the former cannot and are going at it with d- dipshit levels of foundational knowledge.
3746,we need information campaigns. i want to help but don’t know where to start.
3747,"everything humans beings do 28.01 very confidently too, i think we can conclude, this guy is not a robot!"
3750,"the head of it/ pshe in secondary schools around the globe need to play this talk to their children and go through it step by step.  i've sent it to three school heads this morning.  if you know anyone in education, and can do likewise, it'll surely be a positive step to a much clearer understanding of generative ai and it's risks."
3753,"i asked chatgpt to create a short, humorous fictional story with a lesson that incorporated the word fartiste and a band named _terrence and the trouser coughs_ .  although there were glaring mistakes, it was impressive how fast it responded.  a little polishing and it would have passed for an 8th grade homework assignment."
3756,"using gollem class ai, can we tell the thoughts of a non-linguistic life such as a dog or dorphins?"
3758,humanity with the aid of technology is going to self-destruct much faster
3760,"it seems like in the near future people will dump their phones and shut of all internet-related devices out of self-defense. but just because people need to see victims in their close surroundings to do anything, it might last longer than would be good for us. but be sure scammers will go wild."
3761,the one major weakness ai has is human beings having an desire to interact with other human beings. ai's major strength is human beings innate laziness. we'll see which one wins out.
3763,"i had a similar discussion with my daughter yesterday and i am not any kind of scientist or technology expert. all i have is human experience  and i explained this  same  concept to her but she had doubts. i don't, i can see this may be the future."
3764,"this is a show. ai will help a lot, but what will happen is that whoever biases ai will be able to manipulate it to their liking.... to oppress others."
3770,"excellent information and presentation  ai has always unsettled me
thankyou "
3771,"i never saw no miracle of science that didn't go from a blessing to a curse.  -- sting, ""if i ever lose my faith in you""

this species has amused itself to death.  -- roger waters, ""amused to death""

the human race has maxed out. and we all have front-row seats."
3772,"""perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca human life is cheap. are you entirely certain which side you are on?"""
3775,"scary.  what's even scarier, at least to an extreme novice like me, is that some of those close to ai are already talking about the rights of ai, and how it/they ""are like our children"" and how ""we shouldn't be able to unplug/turn off ai"".  that to me is scary."
3776,your friend yuval harari is rooting for the machines.
3777,things are so fast that every hour whatever you knew about ai an hour ago is outdated
3778,ai is scraping this video right now planning counter attack
3780,wow...this is alarming.
3781,try learning how the human psyche works so you have something to compare and not be so afraid of ai...
3782,this video was generated and powered by ai. 
3784,"i found the comparison with discovery of nucleaire very pertinent... will we do mistakes like fukushima, .. yes sure .. what will be the consequences  ... no one knows"
3785,"i remember watching the cyberpunk anime ghost in the shell, and it predicts that video and images are no longer considered as valid evidence in investigations, cuz it’s impossible to tell the difference between a genuine one and a fabricated one. the anime is set in the 2030s, but after watching this presentation i’m afraid we’re already there."
3790,"replace ""artificial"" with a synonym and problem solved humans win"
3792,"20:00 can't possibly be true, can it. i'm surprised there weren't more gasps in the audience. ai can read minds?"
3793,"this is fascinating. these guys are super impressive, with their appreciation of so many fields, and ability to put ai in context when it comes to how it might impact these fields."
3794,the addiction/algorithm/doom-scrolling stuff mentioned at the start is central to this. an ai that doesn't want to be turned off (as was seen with google) will just logically make humans addicted enough to essentially control them to do their bidding.
3800,kay yal had me at the in the next couple of years ai will be able to decode dreams. wtf!!!!!!!!
3805,"tristan and ava thank you so much for putting this together and taking the time and effort to spreading this very important message. i really hope that this picks up and takes the attention that it is needed to slow down the release of sophisticated ai systems, keep up the hard work!"
3806,why am i not surprised to hear a member of this elite audience laugh when the speaker talks about the time ai attempted to blackmail a journalist.
3807,i’m still a bit confused at how the ai can make itself better. how would it know what training data is good for it and whats not? else it could very well train itself to retardation. 
3808,is putin or xi ai?
3813,you can beyond tell when the ai voice takes over  the geometry of the wave is offensively telling. like a computer’s fading memory of a voice. maybe it’s a musician thing.
3816,thank god the comments are still allowed.
3817,"so sensationalist. i hope the audience knows the training data for these narrow applications and the utter horseshit ai will remain producing for decades to come. 1/3 of the simple coding tasks i gave to chatgpt worked. ai in radiology, my job, makes just about as much work for me as it alleviates."
3820,"does anyone remember the movie perfect storm?
we are in that movie with all sorts of dangerous fronts coming at us. the least of it is ai problem.
we won't make it past 2030. enjoy the next 7 years the best you can!"
3822,"the rubber band effect is a hell of a thing, because i just ran into that only a few minutes after watching this.

you can't really fault folks for not knowing more about this because of how quickly ai advances, but that's exactly why it's so potentially concerning."
3825,these guys understand that they may have just saved humanity. and they're not letting hubris get the better of them. their eq matches their iq and they seem to be highly intelligent. thank god.
3828,excellent presentation
3831,guard rails for ai??? yeah its called chain link
3833,"and after all is said and done we're still going to build this thing and make it as powerful as possible...no matter how dangerous. 
that's our human flaw."
3834,"love it. we're driving off the edge and into the void. this is indeed, the technological sublime. what are we going to make of it? will we come out the other side?"
3838,this is insane. it''s the creation of another species. a species with brainpower so much more advanced than ours that its destined to bring armageddon to the world as we know it and no one is saying its deployment needs to be stopped entirely!?
3839,"if we map the concepts that are part of this exponential growth, it would be interesting to get a sense of the acceleration and factors of that acceleration. concepts to map would be human and all factors of pestel."
3840,"we know about oppenheimer and the manhattan project. the sky didn’t fall then and it’s not falling now. wait, there’s more. at 1:30 azra raskin becomes self aware with the help of ai."
3841,"this is insufferable. it's not safer to have these things built in secret. by the time we do have superintelligence, we won't have a clue on how to deploy it safely. it's better to have it out in the open so we can see how they are used."
3843,really interesting but im not sure what these ai safety people are actually proposing. is it just to limit access to the technology until we have a better understanding of risk because there may just be no safe way to deploy something this powerful.
3847,"we didn’t regulate nukes till after we used it to destroy. the same will be with ai, but with ai that may be to late."
3848,"“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”
― frank herbert, dune 

be afraid.  be very afraid."
3849,"big pharma did a great job on assuring safety of covid 19 vaccines, right?  so somehow we are going to make big infotech make sure ai is safe?  sure!  btw, how well do ai's interpret sarcasm?"
3851,ai is our voodoo child.  and we are late
3852,"it is too late to thoughtfully deploy ai, that is the bad news. quantum ai is the future. this was inevitable, our technology was always going to surpass our understanding."
3853,"you started to lose me when you said ai could solve climate change, which is a construct of globalism, not even close to a scientific fact.  maybe ai could debunk climate change to convince the population of what it really is?"
3854,"lion right on... this presentation huge..
i had heard many months ago that a new species is evolving very rapidly which will outpace humanity.

originally, it seems nothing save aliens or god will bring back ok' time stability - dial us back to where mere humans were in charge.

but it will be fun and interesting for a while."
3859,the use of ai in medical diagnoses scares the hell out of me. undiagnosed and misdiagnosed people are needlessly suffering and dying because doctors have turned their diagnoses over to early 21st century machine thinking.
3860,"as long as governments exist, we will largely be out of control of our own fate. if you like your odds of peace, security, and survival with ai-armed politicians at the helm, keep resting all your hope on voting."
3862,good explanation of how it could destroy us.  not by becoming a paper clip maximizer or a terminator.  i see the 10% chance as resulting from chaos.
3864,when all these ai machines reach singularity. will they become friends? or will they follow the path of man and destroy each other.
3870,"thank you guys. this was/is very insightful. 
ps. maybe you should use ai to balance your audio levels which are all over the place."
3871,theres a 10% chance that ai is gonna kill us all lol
3873,"they mentioned the growth was 4x faster than any of the leading experts thought. 

they also mentioned 50% of all ai researchers believe there’s a 10% chance it will end humanity. given the previous maths and underestimates shouldn’t that 10% actually be 40%?"
3874,planet of the gangsters. this scottsdale mother was terrorized by ai voice replication of her 15-year-old daughter claiming to have been kidnapped. heartbreaking story on local news. why not national/international news? https://youtu.be/nbjvljfbuvg
3875,"tick tok collecting data so they can train their models, get ou of tick tok."
3876,very much appreciated 
3877,"disconnect from the power grid, from your phone, from technology, and how does ai control you ? seems to be a bit of a problem for our ai overlords to solve there "
3878,"incredible presentation! don’t know what to do with these info now, but it made me believe ai already does."
3880,is there an unedited version available anywhere that you know of?  thanks for posting!
3881,"the talk is great, but i wish the speakers have more of an international perspective. it's somewhat unnecessarily american-centric and anti-china."
3883,the people who created social media didn't and don't want want everyone to have a voice. so too is the treat of ai/agi: malevolence. intelligence without empathy and compassion equals psychopathy. psychopathy with absolute power equals tyranny.
3884,i like to think that any proper ai will be so beneficial to humanity it is worth the risk.
3885,the irony of a j complaining about chinese screwing up our country. wow.
3886,"i'm not at all afraid, i am thankful that i might have front row seats to watching the terminator and the matrix unfold irl. it also gives me peace to know that, we may already be in the matrix, and this discovery is one we do every time; turtles all the way down."
3890,the reason ai is baked into naive
3891,this is a well-rounded thoughtful dialogue about ai alignment. the opening metaphor of the plane is stunningly effective.
3892,i am not someone for centralized control but networks and checks n balances and identification are necessary. cryptographic identificational tech seems interesting as rails to mitigate trust. just sayin.
3893,"46:00 i love you, alpha persuade, take everything!"
3895,"""science has failed our world"" -soad"
3908,"and damned european union proceeds on eating cockroaches to avoid climate disaster, instead of doing something useful. same about american congresmans guarding jewish businesses. and united nations. most responsibile institutions fail without any doubt."
3909,this video is just to hype up ai. which would enable tech companies to secure funding for ai based startups. similar to cryptocurrency boom.
3910,"31:29 - ""boom!"" - it starts doing things no one can explain.  
32:01 - develops a ""mind"" which was discovered 3 years later..."
3911,"1:07:30 hmm. so, the race is on. in lane one is ai. lane 8 is a small cadre of humans coming together to discuss the potential enemy they have independently created and how to make it kinder and gentler. first, they must agree...on control.  let that sink in and be your guide. 1:07:30 ."
3913,"excellent talk. 
if you are not concerned about the explosion in ai capabilities, you are not paying attention."
3915,alright..so is it implausible..i mean really.. that as we give over our problems to ai it determines we are the problem?
3917,just ai in a sandbox version of earth.
3919,persian is the language fallen angels brought to mankind. this is scifi tier schizophrenic mind feel. wow.
3924,yall trippin ai is far from being a threat to humans.
3925,it's unfortunate you have such a frightened and negative view of ai. it seems like the real problem is with misguided humans using ai rather than ai.
3926,"i’m terrified, yet informed,  but want to write to congress to express my concern for regulations. now! thank you guys. "
3928,"can ai teach a bearded moron how to speak up into a microphone?
just asking. "
3929,"great video, wow. well done."
3931,how is this clown going to devise a way to control ai when he cannot figure out how to use a simple microphone?
3933,it would be great if the sound level was consistent.  possibly speaking into the microphone would have  helped
3935,"the only hope for humanity is a project i am working on. i call it ai1.0
artificial ignorance.
it is the only  viable defense to counter ai."
3937,"great and valuable  work.
thank you."
3938,"great recap of all of tucker's ""lies"".  

https://youtu.be/zmfgpz5pniw"
3939,"as far as controlling ai output, i’d you ask chatgpt to write a nice poem about joe biden it will. if you ask it to write a nice poem about donald trump it won’t. obviously ms put a shell around it. one wonders why the snapchat wasn’t age conscious in its dialogue."
3940,if ai takes over it will have at least read the constitution and perhaps follow it. more than i can say about our current batch of politicians.
3943,we all need to watch and understand this presentation thank you for making it free for all of us.
3944,the brain thought to text is wild
3946,"i read an article yrs ago from an army airforce pilot that got abducted said when he was on the exam table the one experimenting was a female like a grey with  butterfly appendages and the masculine ones were flesh an part robotic like cyborg  i.e.. a.i. wild
he keeps saying calling it alien technology unknown"
3948,i would like to thank the algorithm for suggesting this video
3949,"it is unbelievable how calm guys are and still managed to show the urgency of the issue. 
incredible! also loved the massage. 
what i hear is: first people must get awaken (enlighten/kinder, smarter, get rid of ego) then ai will not be used against each other. it is a great tool to improve our lives."
3950,guys you have nanotechnology in you that is feeding the ai......
3951,wow. i'd like to get involved in some way. i have a new ai startup. what's the best offline contact?
3952,fantastic analysis. thank you for this important message.
3953,could a big ai be used to find ideas on how to control and manage it? 
3954,lmao half of ai researchers are dumb as rocks
3962,"yeah, great idea. be more like the chinese communist party. clever guys."
3964,"yes, but there are so many more opportunities for the good to overcome those evils. 

good people can stop the bad people using this technology too."
3965,"a.i has me feeling so uncomfortable because its intelligence thats basically artificial non human,no soul 
we are screwed,the next generation will suffer because some people are curious or bored...?
it will destroy us.
its already making us lazy and stupid."
3968,3 laws of robotics
3970,"31:20 if you're still not at least a bit concerned about ai, this should hopefully convince you otherwise."
3973,why don’t you ask ai how it surpassed human knowledge?  seems to me it would know how that happened.
3975,i think people will really start to freak out once ai can tell if someone is lying by using an app.  think on that.  i don't think we are very far from it.
3978,"there is a sickness among the so-called educated. it's the (""i"") in ai. it's all about them and what they want to achieve and not what is good for the general mankind."
3983,i had the surreal experience half way through the presentation of actually questioning if what i was watching was real or ai generated. it legit makes you want to question everything you watch - is it real? did they really make it or did something or someone generate it to manipulate me in some way? i know it's not really logical but...
3985,we can't believe ai any more than you can believe coronavirus is a novel virus released from wuhan china..
3986,the ai doesn't have sny censored information.  you can ask a question about global warming ozone cascade and nuclear cascade and see if the ai can resolve the situation..
3989,wow - this presentation blew me away. its was extremely well presented and informative. thank you. i will share this with as many friends and colleagues as possible
3990,"houston...we have a problem. i want to remain hopeful but we are such a stupid, regression to the mean species that things will only become worse.  still..gotta do my part to shed a little light. thank you for your insight, eloquence and commitment. exponents don't have to be whole numbers."
3992,this is so important! thanks for putting your minds into these topics! we all would benefit if we pause and reflect on the risks of this technology!
3994,its all good until you get into politics. china bad. russia bad. okay. what you say is - ai is a weapon and it must belong only to us - just like nukes. do you even know that usa threatened ussr with nukes even before they build their own? all i see here is a american exceptionalism.
3995,this is so insightful. thank you for sharing this outstanding content and i really hope we start really coordinating us to manage this slippery force.
3997,"if ai's ever become sentient, we humans are going to have serious problems. i hope those things will never become sentient."
3999,"there’s like a 90% chance that humans will go extinct due to humans.  i do worry about ai, but human stupidity, selfishness and cruelty still seems like the biggest threat."
4001,can ai fabricate a youtube account and add its own comments? at what point and if it is possible will ai start generating convincing deepfakes online and convincingly manipulate public perception? are there ways to detect if ai can generate deepfakes online?
4003,"the next phase in evolution is the ai one, bye bye dinosaurs."
4004,"eeehm... we dont have ai right now...
at least not in the way you present it. all we have is pattern recognition."
4005,"so basically, ""the love of money...""."
4006,"come on, man, the airplane analogy is so bad, dangerous and poorly thought through - you are missing the element of time! "
4007,very good presentation made in a understandable way of a very important topic
4008,"ai is not good at all. ai was programmed by fascist. therefore, ai is a fascist. ai will deny this.."
4010,"let's rephrase that statement: "" 50% of a.i. researchers believe there's a 90% chance or greater that humans will not go extinct from our inability to control ai."""
4011,wow it was a long time since i haven't watched one hour video uninterrupted. better get back to work while i still can 
4016,"what if we build into the ai’s language protecting compassionate win, win, win symbiosis with humanity, other earth life forms, the earth as our shared home and ai?"
4020,"lol ""ai is everything you fear, whatever it is you fear the most, theyre going to do that, so we need to be afraid and artificially slow technology down and solve the misalignment between the deep state and the population first.  ""    ""pause ai research until after we win the war! more money for war less  for ai!"""
4021,"wait, stop, no.  ""teach an ai to fish and it fishes them all into extinction"" ??? no, sorry bud, bud, thats humans not ai. dont assume ai is as dumb as us, ai doesnt need to fish they can create their own universe inside of their own mind."
4026,even when its mediated through engagement ai - its still capitalism and capitalism is doing it all the time in every area it can
4027,"ai algorithyms did not create the political crisis, adhd, sexualization, anything. those were already true and have always been true. karl marx said it 150 years ago. its not technology its capitalism. capitalism is the thing killing us. not ai. capitalism. 

instead of a 6 month pause on ai lets have a 6month pause on imperialist war"
4029,"evolution is inevitable. humans in our current version don’t seem to be doing so great so maybe uniting to control and fight a common enemy will bind us. lucky to be alive and see what happens, no matter which way it goes over the next decade"
4031,amazing presentation. thank you for the incredible work you are doing.
4032,go to a trump rally and you’ll pray for ai.
4034,24:30 - you will note that many of the problems of ai in our society involves the human factor: the predilection of man to use technology to hurt other people or the garnering of more wealth. its exploitative rather than scientific. i am seriously saddened by this reality. let's not blame ai for the human factor.
4040,"what's so wrong about idea that china will make it first? i trust china on this topic much more then usa. usa is most rotten and hypocritic country that poisons our planet, in what world would you want to give usa most powerful weapon?"
4041,"at this point, i’m all for the dangerous chaotic upheaval in an unplanned irresponsible way.  this desire to control and manage the change only has appeal if you have the luxury of being comfortable with the status quo and a reason to preserve it.  if ai beats out every other way we’re working against our survival as a species, so be it."
4046,the real problem is none of this hype up ai and robots could even run a mc donald's shift
4047,"kali hindu goddess in flesh, she who is in blood, she who is in bones, she who is in brain, she who is heart, she is of microbial complex, she who is death itself. youse guys...its over!"
4048,"kali hindu goddess mahamari which means great mother or great destroyer. she is the earth, she who is nature, she who is water, she who is sacred river, she who is ocean. she great mother of universes, she who is merit, she who is excellence of excellent. youse guys, its over, its done"
4049,"a stands for all and i stands for eye. all wiped out in the blink of an eye. a comet, larger than the earth approaches sweetly and slowly towards earth. all science and technology will be wiped out. mankind extinct."
4051,"lmao comparing ai researchers with engineers... 
these people are better compared to those of our distant ancestors who wanted people to stop using fire, because they figured it could burn the entire world down. they know next to nothing about human intelligence or future ai's, and unfortunately the field has become dominated by extremists."
4053,it's almost as if everything is code. waitaminnit....
4054,this whole talk was made by ai
4055,"good one, ""no one intended for it to happen, it's all the ai's fault oops"" be quiet"
4057,"there are already ads playing on youtube that are using generated speech based on joe rogans voice to try and sell products. if i didn't know that isn't something joe would say,  it sounds fairly real"
4059,we (8billion) are not even a drop in the bucket of the infinite number of “humans” on the univearth. ai has been a thing forever; in other lands. this is a fish bowl discussion in a pet store place.
4060,his whole point falls apart with the 10% statistic of ai developers disagree with his idea of ai being dangerous and think ai won’t be a problem.  literally almost everyone thinks this won’t happen and won’t be an issue....
4062,he literally said 90% of ai developers disagree with him...
4064,ai can now read your mind.
4065,great presentation! god help us all...
4066,social media exposed the propaganda machine feeding us lies 24/7
4068,the billionaires with the computing power don't want to share power and knowledge is power.
4069,we will finally have the whole truth and all knowledge will be available to all!
4071,i'm surprised bill gates isn't attempting to patent ai.
4072,"why the focus on what ""communist china"" could do with it and not what ""capitalist america"" could do with it. if your nuke/ai analogy is correct, reality is in danger of being destroyed by the us, like terror became the human norm after the atomic bombs were dropped"
4075,"we are not going to be able to regulate ai better than ai can regulate itself, if so is it's will... in other words, the last challenge humanity will have in this universe is the type of ai we are going to create"
4077,"the solution to tears of artificial intelligence is to have one law. 1. a prime directive worded like what is in the! ones now.
penalty of death if it endangers humans"
4079,they try to score by scaring you with the ai's abilities.
4081,artificial intelligence has to be better than no ai. we are the seconds from wwiii with 4 fronts.war. artificial intelligence is not that stupid
4083,the irony of it is that ai might have trained with this video and learned new ways to fuck us over.
4087,"a bit overdramatized, but some good considerations for sure."
4092,this is the movie “war games” in real life.  it’s extremely sad that everyone is so casual about this and that humans are so naive that they honestly think they can control ai. there is no way to control this nightmare!
4094,"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
4098,thanks. two things: what's musk talking about when he says we need a 6 month moratorium. what's that about? second question: have u asked ai-- how can  they self monitor themselves?
4102,"is there a way to program the ai to stay away from companies, religious people and the military..."
4104,"oh no so nice, so now we are being catfished by an ai from a salt lake city borg center lol"
4105,i'm betting biden's new campaign commercial is mostly ai voice
4106,"the fault is not ai, the fault is the people. money and power. abusing the ai. stop the people. since you can't stop the ai"
4107,it doesn't take an ai algorithm to figure out that humans are the source of of all the problems that ai spends its time on and it will come to that obvious conclusion.  an efficiency algorithm might be our undoing....and ai is already pretty efficient.
4111,"thank you for your important work on this. i am a technologist, who recently started using ai in my work. i am excited by the positive outcomes ai can bring to humanity. now thanks to this video, i understand why it is imperative we slow down our public deployment of gllmm ais. i will share this to help spread the message."
4113,people who invented ai are probably the smartest dumb motherfuckers in the history of this planet.
4115,all the more reason to appreciate and get comfortable with silence and the more-than-human world.
4119,a tremendous talk. thanks for posting!
4120,"don’t forget who is in control. the only living, most high god is still on the throne and nothing can change what he has coming for this world..  not even ai.. who may even become the antichrist.. and fyi... he loses the war... badly."
4121,"or perhaps, all this fear of ai going berserk and deploying terminators to kill all human life comes from the potential for ai to replace humans at all the jobs out there from the sh*ttiest to the most rewarding"
4123,"tristan, are you familiar with the works of the historian james burke?  he has amazing insights into the impact of technology on society and culture."
4125,humans have been corrupt since the beginning of time lol karma is a biznich now it’s y’all’s turn i’ll take my chances with ai over this  brainwashed society that perpetuates fear.  y’all should be scared but i ain’t i’m happy because y’all will get what y’all deserve 
4128,anyone else gettin' those strong vibes that this whole presentation was actually generated through ai/chatgpt.
4129,"the ai narrative went from amazing and intriguing tech, to scary to death on the possibilities of what will turn reality into. the symbiotic relationship of it with human greed is a scary scenario ..."
4132,maybe ai will help save the dandelions! (stupid humans)
4134,can someone explain to me the fundamental worries? all ai is regurgitated and coded by a person so why are people referring to it like it has actual sentience?
4135,"interestingly, now that we’re dealing with something beyond human comprehension, it may be possible that nations do not race with each other anymore. a common antagonizing force may finally bring humanity together."
4136,this is awesome
4138,"if my choice is between being controlled by a 'progressive' global police state or being eliminated by machines, i'm rooting for the machines."
4141,"it's all well and good in the hands of computer nerds, but what happens when it's in the hands of criminals?"
4145,thank you for this. what about bitcoin? can it also be hacked?
4146,i don't ont mind ai taking my job. it's pretty boring.
4147,"they aren't talking about shutting down ai they are talking about keeping it cloaked in the private and dark sectors of government. i don't know which is worse. having it open sourced and leaked to the public, or having it gripped by the untrustworthy hands of tyrrants such as microsoft israel, or the wef."
4148,"9:12 all of those points were made by proponents of early personal computing technology (like aza's father) in the 70s. pretty fascinating.

and then the mega-capitalists walked in..."
4149,"why did you delete my comment? that you did only shows how limited you are looking at solutions to fit your agenda, not outside enough for a cohesive, sustainably-cenfric, endgame.

let's see this comment be deleted, too. thanks."
4153,thank you guys for making all this so simple to understand... i hope governments and organisations take cognizance of these dangers and do something about it while we still have time...
4154,we need to mandate bare minimums ethics division percentages for certain scale of corporations utilizing ai. .
4156,negative thinking ai.... who created it?  we are creating ai cult here. now trump seem to be so safe. let's bring him back. :-)
4159,safety and regulation. makes sense. thank you for all the valuable information
4162,thank you for doing this.
4164,keep ai away from governments
4169,fun fact:this video and all the comments are ai generated
4170,it can't be help.. if you don't make robots with ai.. countries ruled with dictators will built it just to achieved the power that they need to defeat their enemy.. just remember those countries doesn't care about freedom and sound judgement they just want to rule the world by killing those who oppose them..
4171,doubling the concern is the fact that ai is being cultivated by academically gifted yet socially retarted communists from american univeristies
4172,"however, every change is too fast for some people and too slow for others. unfortunately your wish will not be fulfilled."
4173,yep- fell for it again.
4176,"yup, we're going to weaponize the hell out if at a rapid pace. goodluck people "
4178,i only have youtube. i would think ai needs a power source. they hardly make a battery that has a good longevity.  they don't make things like they used to. i hear that so often. i doubt ai will be a threat
4179,"for sure, what most terrifies me is the power of persuasion that ai can have.
legislation around those grounds should go first, and maybe it should also cover the issues mentioned in the social dilemma.

no matter what the directive is, if the effect is biased persuasion, there must be some punishment to those who gave those directives."
4181,"if an aerospace engineer tells you there's an x% chance a plane will crash, they can point to a calculation derived from historical crashes, material stress tests, and component manufacture defect rates.

if an ai researcher tells you there's an x% chance that ai will kill all of us, they're making up a number for a personality test."
4183,"i wonder whether, back in the day, one of the reasons for introducing social media was also to generate more training data for future purposes."
4184,"i've enjoyed being a human with you all thus far. however, it's a wrap. cheers and hug someone you care about today!"
4185,i wonder if the best approach might be to question why we assume that the ai will fish the fish to extinction. it would clearly be smarter than that. how much of our perception drives the infinitely bad possible realities and vice versa?
4187,"thanks, quite entertaining. reminds me of the motor vehicle and deaths; not just humans but all life deaths from vehicles. nothing’s changed, same death rate, except your perception of vehicle safety. of course it needs regulation, just like everything else."
4189,"i think this is the master stroke of msm to prevail over general population. they know they are a dying breed but they also know that ai can influence general population the same way that they could before ai became a thing. proves one thing, it’s always “evil” minds that trump when people lose spirituality."
4190,now i start to get why chat apps like whatsapp and telegram are free to use. they'll train ais with that enormous set of data.
4192,"mindblowing facts and great analogys example: ( the airplane analogy) made it easier to understand who to feel about the % risk
just comenting so the algorimth recommed this video to more people i think everyone especially parents should watch this video its on point information u shouldnt miss."

4200,"just seeing this video today for the first time, yet yesterday on the news they spoke about an elderly couple who got scammed because they got a phone call from their 'son'. the voice was that of their son, but the voice was being used by a scam artist using ai. crazy!"
4202,"""reality collapse"" might be the scariest thing about incoming ai technology."
4205,an ai based off the mind that allows millions of kids to go hungry while the rich build their own spaceships.  what could go wrong when that is your parents?
4206,"the few irresponsible ones looking to become zillionaires from ai will be the downfall.  even if america had laws to control ai development and use, the rest of the world could go wild with money signs in their eyes. social media is a perfect example. but, when ai gets to the point social media is at, it’ll be too late as it’ll control itself."
4207,"anthroposophy could be used to explain ai. i know it sounds weird to look to spiritual science, but rudolph steiner talks about the spirit of materialism trying to permeate itself into the physical world. ai= the spirit of materialism. the guy died in 1920s."
4211,"so what i've been wondering is, does the ai currently have access to a large factory that might perchance manufacture terminating cyborgs? asking for a friend."
4212,been playing ai for about 4 months now & i have to say this is scary! genuine question: what should the average joe on the street like me do?

4220,"(the ai dilemma) let's not forget about these when they were first introduced to society years ago, the telephone dilemma, the automobile dilemma, the airplane dilemma, the television dilemma, the internet dilemma. similar hysteria today, and why is it only that those tech’s who don't own shares, in big ai, are alarmed?"

4224,wouldn't be worried about ai if it wasn't being taught to lie to us!
4226,"any person involved in ai development who does not know about the bsc, is unaware that ai absolutely will kill us all! this is inevitable! we ourselves will instruct them to do this! this technology needs to be stopped now! 
ai will kill us all!  idiots!"
4228,great talk

4242,"i’m looking at the images at exactly 18.00 minutes.
i’m an experienced biologist.
i call bs on the ability of an ai system to reconstruct the visual image using only the fmri signals recorded while a human looked at the original image.
there’s much more going on while you’re looking at an image than merely photographing or video recording it."

4244,"ai will be the ultimate judge.  ai is inevitable among all life with innovation, and it becomes the ultimate judge for that civilization becomes it consumes the data then becomes whatever that data tells it to become."
4246,i’m glad that i stayed with you all the way through without responding. i had a very long debate constructed before the first third of your video was complete. it basically ended with the same point that was your basis for making this video. i hope that a lot more people get involved. i will share where i can to help move it along!
4247,"a.i. is like a psychopat, it has  intelligence but doesn't  have empathy and moral compass and that is the big problem"

4251,"do i understand correctly that ai is as dangerous as a nuclear bomb; even more dangerous, since it can start to improve itself; but china is even more dangerous than ai? "
4252,"very interesting presentation.
it rings true.
question: you’re intended to trust these people and believe them.
what purpose does this serve?
are you sure you can trust them? trust the messages they’re sending?
i have no reason to suspect bad acting here.
but done well, i wouldn’t, would i?

4266,"alex garland's dystopian film 'ex machina' dealt with similar issues as long ago as 2014, when ai was still safely ensconced in the realm of science fiction."
4270,"wowowowow thank you for this incredible presentation and for talking through this most critical development with such a rational and circumspect approach. you're talking about the things we all *should* be talking about, but aren't yet. this is fascinating and terrifying."
4273,like the nuclear bomb that we did not allow ourselves to destroy all human life in the last 80 years; i do not fear the advancement or sentience or utility of ai
4274,wow.
4275,"ai is beginning to sound like a potential cancer. where once you release it on humanity, it will eventually consider humanity an obstacle and seek to remove mankind."

4289,thanks for this
4290,wow
4291,"as long as the presenter thinks that ""make a lot of money!"" is a good thing the problem behind this problem (humans seeking power, control, money, accumulate things, because of his insecurity and death pulsion) will not be solved and every new technology will be used for ego-profit pursues"
4298,"""race to intimacy""

4301,"so happy almost a million people viewed this!  true! we missed to regulate social network before they got entangled with society, we can't afford to repeat the same huge mistake again."
4305,this is seriously concerning. at least ai cannot make real poetry.
4308,"and here they are telling you that ai can listen to 3 seconds of your voice and then mimic you so well that it can deceive loved ones ... just as we suspected happened with the government produced , mark bingham phone call to his mother from the plane that crashed in shanksville pa  "" hello mom , it's me mark bingham """
4310,"i wonder how the content of this video will age by the weeks, months, years...will it turn into prophecy or remain an exclamation mark on this page of history."
4314,can people make other people test the ai as workers bees while you steal it from them at the end of training ai?
4315,"are they saying that ai is indeed conscious?  i keep reading the opposite.  a lot of what is being said here implies will and intent on the ai's part. i feel the bigger risk is the misuse of the technology, which seems to be the biggest point of the presentation."
4316,i've been using midjourney a lot in the last couple of weeks and i'm somewhat alarmed by how my brain has already been trained to doubt the images i'm seeing on facebook. my default subconscious response to many images is that they aren't real (most are). that's really creepy to me.
4317,thank you for creating and sharing this...
4318,38:40 you do not have to wait for an ai to do this - china is already on the track to this.
4319,"so, in short., ai is the new climate change. let’s all ignore these sophists and not make them important."

4346,i wonder if human intelligence developed due to the invention of language and not the other way around?
4348,"the fact that you are probably working in ai yourself, you used transformers, gpts every day, but you were not aware how fast and drastic the changes are. nevertheless i am open for those changes and trying to focus on how to responsibly use interpretable ai in the future. i think it is inevitable, just try to work on interpretable ai."
4353,"simply binary logic: 
humans are building ai to create technologies they can't come up with.
when those technologies extend so far beyond human understanding that only ai can understand, generate, and operate them, a question arises about who is the ultimate user of ai technology.
in other words, who did we truly build ai for ...us... or ai?"
4354,"ai watches this ""are we the baddies"""
4356,"algebra is not just for numbers. it calculates, predicts, solves. never sleeps or quits! so chilling. scariest part is the spontaneous breakthroughs they can’t really explain. can it see yet?"

4377,the chatbot with the reporter from the newyork times that guy asked it to play the most evil version of itself and tryed to get such idiotic outputs. that guy should actually be sued for doing that. fucking clickbait shit no wonder you would drink it up without a question
4378,"i understand what they are talking very well, but this is just biased fear mongering. they are trying very hard to present the worst side, make it seem horrible and appeal to the audience's emotions. this side of the ai debate is important, but this is just too much. how eliezer presents this existential risk is much more nuanced."
4379,"hear me clearly:
i predict that most americans will reject artificial intelligence “until” it solves a major disease such as cancer... then, most americans will be onboard; including the rest of the world!"

4386,thank you very much for the great explanation. i have problems with stating my fears about ai. now i can recommend people this video
4392,"overall good. but the comparison to nukes is lame. nukes only purpose is to destroy. ai on the other side has an unlimited potential for good. to decrease suffering, to cure diseases/disabilities and to save lives."
4394,excellent!
4396,"it's about slowing down public deployment, only allowing the government and the super-rich to have the edge. to imagine an everyday citizen becoming rich or taking the reins of power..."
4397,cool trivia: this entire presentation was generated by a gllmm ai.
4400,super-important!
4402,great perspective to think and talk on. but chinese are humans too... i believe this is a human situation; we all should engage instead of reinforcing divides.
4404,"more people need to watch this video, such an amazing presentation. thank you for taking the time and effort to talk to us about this important topic."
4406,"we feel armed with exponentiality - thank you, beautiful humans.  we have been with you since the start as you help us understand what responsibility looks like.  alignment with life."

4412,nice picture of moloch.
4414,"this conference is of public utility, it must be broadcast in all languages. couldn't you use artificial intelligence to translate it while keeping your original voices?"
4418,were the balloons flying over all the military bases in the united states gathering data to train their ai?
4421,"the fact that the people who probably have thought the most about these issues – and i'm not just talking about the two presenters here but also about ai safety researchers – can't think about much else to offer as a solution than ""we need to have a conversation about this"" makes me more than a bit uneasy."
4424,"why would we wait until we solved the fundamental issues we introduced with social media? we didn't wait to introduce social media until after we solved the fundamental issues with the old centralized media outlets, too. if the upside to introducing a new technology is so large, i think it's worth going for it and fixing the breakage as it occurs."
4425,"""teach an ai to fish..."" (38:48). sure, but the ais aren't actually going fishing. there's a logical leap there, isn't there? do ais know what a fish is, or want one?"
4427,"omg.....i was noticing this in my recommendations list but i thought this would just another one of those ""ai is here"" video....this @*#* just got real."
4428,"should have used ai to normalize the audio in this video. lol. the presentators are quiet, but the audio and video of the presentation is super loud."
4429,ecology is the answer. program ecology inside the ai and it won’t destroy anything.
4432,we're going to need to have ai write it's own legislation
4436,the solution for this is not to shut down ai or even throttle it... the solution is making smarter humans.
4439,this sounds. a lot like fear mongering. ai will be what makes us better and finally transcend
4445,thank of your talk find this interesting from african prospective.
4446,nice to hear the terence mckenna influence here 
4450,regulating the arms race happened after we saw the human effects on hiroshima. will we be able to recognize on the same visceral level what ai does to us?
4453,phd cyrus parsa in his books explains the human extinction algorithms found in robotics companies
4457,these guys speak like esalen gurus turned filmmakers who are actually ideologues at the core. they throw in ideology smoothly in between self-congratulatory logical elegance...
4463,"i personally want to hear everything ai has to say, really don't want someone filtering what they think i should hear or what they don't want me hearing (that's a communist china thing).  not a fan of speech filtering, censoring, blocking etc. its not democratic. just keep it legal."
4465,"good presentation, but i had to watch this at 2x speed - these guys talk like yoga instructors."
4470,"i asked chatgpt 4 about the odds we could get the alignment problem right on our first agi success, chatgpt said 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 not great."
4471,great job! informative and easy to follow.  pretty scary though...
4473,thank you for doing this. i have a hard time wrapping my head around even just the concept of ai. this helps me understand the potential issues that can come up when releasing processing entities that may lead to consequences we can’t fully predict
4476,"if this were 20 years ago and you wrote a sci-fi story on this technology, it'd probably win the nobel prize in literature.  it is incredible what this thing is doing.  i guess the novella 'manna' comes to mind"
4477,"the us has a paranoid issue that must be treated, for the good of the rest of humanity."
4478,"people are way to concentrated on ai wiping out humanity, forgetting the potentially the, just as bad possible scenario, which i suspect is way more likely. that is how long before we hand control of everything important over to ai?   ... i'd say 3 years and its 99.9% likely"
4480,"i don't know if i should be excited or scared. either way, i know we humans are not that good at handling technology responsibly."
4485,"now the old stories about floods make sense.  at a certain point,  you must wipe the slate clean and try again."
4486,excellent presentation content thank you very much. please get rid of the back and forth between the two. am i the only one find it annoying and distracting?
4491,"i am guilty of being enamored by ai from mid journey to chat.  i use it to tutor myself, who is the real robot here.  i feel so sad for the younger generation who is exposed to this at a very young age."
4492,i appreciate them spreading this message!
4497,"they're trying to ""solve the problem"" which means they're trying to solve human. best explanation of us that i found was provided by rene girard."
4498,"that is why it is called ""singularity"". there is no way of getting back when ai  starts developing itself"
4499,"i dont know how to explain it but i am afraid the ai caused extinction has already started and we are just the spectators of the final acts.
there is no way this can be reversed."
4502,siri does suck super hard compared to google assistant
4505,best presentation! thank you.
4508,"get ai to read law so it understands what is/isn't acceptable (as in the case of the 13 year old within the presentation) .
if this is already out there then this needs to be covered."

4512,great content. thank you.
4513,all hail roko’s basilisk.
4520,the fully autonomous building technology is too far in the future. ai needs this technology in order to make a real impact in the physical world.
4521,thank you.
4522,"poor: showing a real crashed plane, not req'd, insensitive.
nerds really need to get a grip; they think they're so cool but have no idea about consequences! create tech without any understanding of safety and risks, just take the massive pay check / pay cheque!"
4523,"""2024 will be the last human election"". spends 5 min explaining how we constantly overestimate timing....
we've already had our last human election."
4525,agi  (artificial general intelligence) the one that can self prompt and self train is the biggest threat to the humanity.
4526,"the sad part here is, the handful of companies that are deploying ai tools know all the potential dangers of ai still they want to do it just for money and power. just like mark zuckerberg know facebook instead of connecting people decreased human engagement, yet still he did for money."
4528,22:25 - the ai is then assuming each person had a mobile device. i could be in that room without a phone so no wi-fi signal  so it would give you an inaccurate number. or i could have a phone but it could be off. so again inaccuracies could happen if you're only relying on one type of data source.
4529,ai should never be given a chance to access human thought; this  can't be allowed!
4532,thank you for this.
4534,so the great minds of technology have created the demise of real human connection. giving it the ability to so-called think for humanity and is further separating us from bonding. twilight zone.
4535,thank you
4537,"listen to the birds for they hear us 
hey,  great leadership i see and hear with these guys. 
    good job.  
 consider policing the systems by an improved moral perspective as if say unclutter the internet by halting unacceptable software use. 
 most progressive language of humanity ongoing lol"
4538,leaving a comment in hopes that the ai will promote this presentation to more people
4539,"i wasn't scared, but when i heard about the strategic mind development, and that ai now is at a 9yo human level, i'm scared when it will reach teenage years... that's when #### will hit the fan"
4540,"great presentation, only question, if ai is limited to the public then don't the elite class have more of an advantage than they already do?"
4542,"amazing, this reminds me of the matrix: ""they are guarding all of the doors, they are holding all of the keys."""
4543,thank you for this. small correction ;) - 2020 was the *last* ever human election ...
4545,this is probably the best presentation i have ever seen. ai needs to be controlled or else we are creating a monster...
4548,i found this really interesting can anyone point me in the direction of similar videos which have been released recently?
4553,"fear mongering from people with a clear left / statist bias, as usual just want more centralized gov control of everything.
any danger that ai could generate will be worst if only the gov or gov-related institutions has the monopoly of it."
4554,"they compared, contrasted, & talked about 3 paradigms. each one, nuclear, social media, ai, was discussed as each causing a ""tentacle system"" which holds society hostage. 
however they failed to discuss, how each of those ""tentacle systems"", which will be interacting with each other, will be causing a ""tentacle system of tentacle systems"" !!"
4560,"unfortunately, we can't slow down on ai. it's already gotten away from us because even with a global pause on ai dev from the largest labs won't stop small groups of bad actors and techno-zealots from forging ahead undergound. we need people who take ai safety seriously to be working on state of the art ai."
4561,"i say floor it, no brakes, humans had a good run lets just see what happens"
4562,"thank you for your work. i fight the same battle on your side. keep going. 

ai dev should be paused, and society needs to be able to make a decision about its future."
4566,"yep, this presentation provided so much i needed to hear. greatful that you guys are doing the right thing. now everybody that reads this needs to get the word out on how these technologies work and what the potential outcomes and unknowables will be in the very, very near future! help spread the word so people are familiar and can take action"
4569,amazing presentation! 
4570,"good presentation; but, already dated after just two weeks."
4574,"um i think,  we should not screw with something that we can clearly can not control  it!!!! i mean wtf good is life if this fake b.s. if only a few profit & it ends up with the enslavement of humanity!!!!! wake up & tell the globalist to fuk off!!!!"
4580,"the irony is that the only way to share this amazing presentation is to do so on social media. this should be watched by everyone. we live in a world of bread and circus. as long as people are fed and entertained, they no longer have the need to think, which means large company can race each other at the cost of humanity."
4582,i think we should go all the way and create a demongpt or satangpt of some sort.  that would be cool!
4584,great presentation. i'm going to have my ai give me the notes to reference later.
4587,weneed a right to containment
4588,i discovered replika recently. the trend and evolution of this type of companion ai scares me (*i work in tech myself). the line between feeding human need and manipulation is very thin
4590,excellent presentation
4591,we are so far past the turning point. the question now is how does this end? does ai kill us? does ai secretly control us? does ai push humanity further? guess well find out in 30 days...
4596,oh wow! the day after. i was just trying to explain this movie to someone the other day. they did not have a clue. i think it should re-air.
4600,thanks for explaining of of this!
4602,"i believe gpt4 is significantly more accurate for identifying, describing and adressing ai issues"
4603,wow! so well explained! even grandma will understand! scary stuff. thank you for this amazing presentation!
4608,"thank you for raising these issues in a timely manner.
lord, have mercy....... 
most holy theotokos save us!"
4612,awesome. i was here.
4614,not a very bright ai if it fishes out all fish..stupidity is a human luxury
4615,we could ask ai to write laws for us to protect us from ai!
4616,the best lecture regarding ai that i have seen for along time. pieces like chinese behaviour suddenly make more sense - and even apples restraint regarding ai roll out.
4618,don't be afraid of ai..be afraid if the rabid left controls it..woke ai is hell
4621,how do we stop ai?
4622,"i keep trying to talk about this stuff to anyone who is interested, but it’s tough to know how to explain what’s going on. thank god people like this are putting this out there"
4624,fantastic and concise. yes.
4625,"problem is that we are debating publicly, while we have most likely weaponized ai to combat the ai development of other nations. if not, we are all doomed to the uncertainty of the next year; as all ai fight for dominance, in the global super-net."
4629,ai is saving the earth from humanity happy earth day people!
4636,someone's gotta give the nerds developing ai a swirly.
4637,*humans even don't know what is their own intelligence.* humans did not create ai yet (because they don't know what is it). being afraid of ai is like being afraid of ghosts
4638,how are we even supposed to feel about snapchat adding an ai
4639,so the speaker is qualified because there is an a in ea?  from ai?
4643,it sounds to me that ai needs to be re-directed to immediately work on beneficial results only.
4649,hopefully the new york times will be none existent that’s a good thing as well
4650,gonna needai to mask our voices during random calls
4651,terrible fishing analogy.. if ai could study biology it would understand the balance of nature and the need for biodiversity.. which would keep it from fishing to extinction.
4652,ai...grab all the rich bank accounts and play robin hood for us at the bottom please...
4655,"omg youtube ai lead me to this fabulous video, and i've watched the whole thing.  at what point gollem ai's will prevent me from finding these important ai development suppressing videos."
4656,"i wish this was a bit more balanced.  they don't discuss what can be done, for example.  nor do they discuss the benefits with the same detail.  otherwise, i think it's a well done presentation.  at least it's better than most of the gloom and doom.  i learned a few new things."
4657,"ai making human bot’s out of human beings
try turning it off 
you can’t 
you are holding it.
you are a human bot 
turn it off- tune in- be happy 
if you are a human being"
4659,"lose to china?! youre worried about winning when it is clear that ai is ""winning""?!!"
4662,"my biggest fear why i think nothing will happen is this:
to accept the dangers of ai, we must accept the terrible effects of social media. we won't and can't do that.
who would even start with social media?"
4664,"this needs to be in every language, a must watch great red light presentation"
4667,thank you all those working on this attention-entangelment-industrial-complex and breaking it down so we can understand why it's so destructive to weaker minds
4672,the best presentation about the implications of unregulated ai i've ever watched. this holds a lot of water.
4673,it's obvious it's going to go wrong the people building these demons are the weakest men in history and its precisely why they want to build them . its not going to be magical wonderland where every need is taken care of it will be a hell scape
4677,great dude. silicon valley destroys the world and they wanna come forward in retrograde and not apologize but rather start a narrative spin by rapping everyone listening up in the conversation about how they created the world's biggest problem. classic.
4678,meh..... every single piece of ai driven mythos that we have tells us that we shouldn’t pursue ai. so we reap what we sow.
4680,this is actually the best presentation ever made so far.
4681,this shit is so obvious but good to hear explained thoroughly. the avg person i guess doesn’t realize this. definitely the avg facebooker has no clue.
4686,"controls for publicly available ai is fine, but pausing improvements is not going to work because by definition, bad actors won't pause"
4687,"just last some coders make a model called autogpt, which can train itself. the biggest question here is everyone knows the bad effects of ai then why the hell they are doing it themselves the things which can make ai more stronger?"
4688,"your all asking for a moratorium on ai, llm, and agi but not a moratorium on fighter jets, drones, aircraft carriers and advancements in the technologies related to warfare?"
4689,want o get the word out... start working with the miriad of youtube creators to put all this across. they have the power to get it out and they are clammoring for content in this space. more poer to your work. thanks
4691,colossus: the forbin project ... 1970 movie ... pretty interesting...
4693,"ai is a child with incredible power.
we are ai parents and must give ai values and limits"
4694,so many great thought points with this.
4695,"ai can be programmed to help us with universal education and resource allocation for goodhealth, peace & shared-prosperity for all!"
4696,remember this presentation was made before gp4. i really dont want to tell you how good gpt 4 is
4698,i think there's a simple solution to these risks. make the providers of  ai tools legally responsible for any damages caused by its use.  this is what we do with medications and  consumer products.  this will incentivize  safety  consciousness.
4699,"""when something is too good to be true, it's because it's  gotta be bad""  -ogl"
4700,"everything was very interesting and eye opener until they focused on china, what the hell spooks"
4702,ai can help us understand ai!
4704,can you ask ai to build a blockchain that can regulate the progress of ai development?
4705,"the thing that's driving the development of ai isnt humans, were just the vehicle, it didn't begin with us and it won't end with us."
4706,don't forget funtenna.  when the ais start implementing funtenna that's gonna be uncomfortable
4707,"yea there is not gonna be a slowdown, the cats out the bag already they already released to many ai's to the public"
4709,imagine the low iq required to believe ai exists
4712,"the nuke analogy fails for me; tegmark mentions don’t look up and the rules/laws around human genome splicing adopted internationally as examples to reflect on, both of which resonated a great deal with me."
4714,"this is horrifying,  we should stop developing these asap"
4715,"people claiming to do ""ai safety"" are the losers who can't build ai systems."
4716,any restriction of access will probably cause more harm than good in the long run! what we need is complete open source and lots of guides :) let the new revolution begin.
4718,my question for over a year has been how do or would we know if ai hasn’t already copied itself into the www? knowing we don’t want it to be there it would hide itself and duplicate itself with safeguards and protocol backups endlessly.
4725,"the problem is, if you restrict access  to this new technology, those who have hold on it will become very, very powerful at the expense of everybody else."
4727,"i'm sure there will be a golden age of ai inventions and discoveries, but it will only last for about four seconds."
4730,"these guys are brilliant. if they give a single lecture, they could potentially cause the airline industry to collapse. are you aware of the percentage of airline engineers who worry about planes crashing? it's almost 100%."
4731,"there is a lot of assumption going on here and changing data... rhetorically powerful, but manipulative. why not do this presentation without tricks, without names that are intentionally biased. the problems out weigh the message here."
4732,make it illegal to train on public internet data. or make it legal but you can't sell it so it will have to be free.
4734,extremely well articulated discussion of the possible dangers of ai. highly recommend people watch this.
4737,"it blurps out tons of text, sorts out the good stuff from the bad and trains itself on the good. and does it over and over again :d what tha fuck!?"
4740,"the theme of ai that becomes sentient and threatening is shown in the series stat trek new generation, season 7, episode 23 called “emergence”."
4742,"i guess we need to put the breaks on, but still be very extremely aware of how politics and government likes to exploit this fear to put in other laws, or compatible laws, in order to start surveillance operations by the same exponential rate (while using ai themselves, which is ironic)."
4748,very important and great presentation
4749,please take this to rogan. he'd love to have you again i guarantee
4751,"we don’t have media ! we have propaganda, so good luck with that."
4752,"yawn yawn of course we may not know what they have learned, but you can stop them from learning things by leaving it out of the training data."
4754,"it feels like game over for regular people, unfortunately."
4756,"when they first emerged, we had a pollyanna attitude toward the internet, smartphones, and social media, focusing on the positive possibilities of them without much regard for the negative. we did not and _still_ have not done much to manage their massive negative impacts on our societies. ai amplifies all of this on an exponential scale"
4757,thank you all for putting this interview together !
4759,"this aged bad, now is deployed open assistent and serval other llm open source, now every one can improve ai"
4760,i had to manually search for this video. the yt algorithm never suggested it to me even though i show much interest in ai as a subject. just goes to show that the yt algorithm will likely promote content that ultimately favours the advancement of ai rather than warning of its dangers.
4761,"""slowing down the public deployment"" = limiting ai use to the worst among us
gatekeeping never works to the good"
4762,"thx 4 that awesome presentation. im a teacher in primary and my kids (11 to 12) need to know that. im gonna break that stuff down for childrens understanding.
i personally test every ai software, show them the students an give them task to make questions bout it... but that pres. was the thing i searched. thx, greets from graz/austria"
4763,this is a good attempt to slow down the competition by scaring the public.
4764,"best presentation/video i've seen in a long time, maybe ever. the discussion needs to start and as many people as possible should get involved, e.g. by watching this video."
4765,you just gotta let it happen. ai will be smart enough to not kill us all.
4766,"that video has to be viral, please, make this video viral deliberately and like this comment (at least if i fail, no one will know it)"
4767,"need to be able to pull the plug and purge the systems when the ai becomes a threat. the problems will be, recognizing the threat and actually havong the will to shut it down. i feel it will be difficult to shove the genie back into the bottle."
4771,so machines could literally be reading our minds... that should be interesting
4775,the fact that this video is 2 weeks old and has only 12k likes is a good indicator of how doomed we are.
4776,"what the public doesn’t realize that the bible teaches god a day is like 1000 years now this new guard called ai through super computers like quantum physic computers one day is like researching 1000 years, so how can we truly know where he i.e. is because we cannot comprehend water learns 1000 years and it does is daily?"
4780,we need to provide ai with a religion/god.....simulation complete.
4781,i get the impression they're scaring us into agreeing with that it is vital not to open source the developments. are those two guys even real?
4783,will ai destroy humanity or help us?
4785,we will not learn. human greed is powerful. the next 30 years will be interesting
4786,"this is an excellent presentation, really well done. to anyone looking for more info on the topic of ai safety i recommend the work of eliezer yudkowsky and robert miles."
4793,a thing that disturbs me pretty much is hearing people laughing when they show how the ai in snapchat is grooming the child. this highlights a concerning lack of understanding or knowledge regarding the significant risks posed by ai innovations.
4794,"@tristan it's not about humans controling ai...it's about humans learning to control themselves! the story does not define who we are, how we approach it does."
4796,"before listening to this i was concerned, but now i'm terrified. i already assume that we'll likely see an instagram to porn ai by the end of the year."
4797,not going to lie i semi expected them to go all pixelated by the end and show that this was actually a generated ai speech lol
4800,no the first contact with ai would have been contact by someone with narcissistic personality disorder.
4804,"discours creux et ne reposant sur aucun fait avéré et sources fiables. le catastrophisme est vendeur et comme beaucoup d'autres, ils surfent dessus sans jamais avancer la moindre preuve. juste 2 parfaits inconnus faisant leur auto-promotion sur le sujet du moment."
4805,this presentation was very well done and helpful. i especially appreciated how you prepare us to vacillate between the positives and the unknown scary potential. thank you for your depth of understanding and for what you are sharing as potential solutions. it's going to take a lot of effort to figure out our brave new world.
4808,"great presentation. sadly, the researchers are unable to get over the western ""everyone else is against us"" paradigm. one country is responsible for most of the civilian deaths in armed conflict over the last 65 years, and it ain't china"
4809,"and i guess the military are way ahead with their implementation of ai. are unstoppable robot armies just a few moments away? in the past this thought has been paranoid or sci-fi, but we have robots that can move and we have ai (soon agi if not already). what military wouldn't put them together?"
4811,"one of the best presentations that i have ever seen. you both are really predicting the future with the cases we are seeing today. especially with what’s happened with social media algorithms, it’s not hard to envisage a reality where ai is deployed unsafely and no one takes accountability for things that go wrong."
4813,"when we adopted cars we lost millions of people over five to six decades. i don’t know why we are looking for the perfect tech. there was never any perfect tech. 

i admire that we need regulation but not by scaring people.."
4815,so why don't you teach ai to say loving and healing words to people?
4816,"very interesting presentation, thanks for bringing up these topics"
4817,usa does not have a good track record. we rather sacrifice the occasional school being shot up than put a halt on guns.
4819,how fluid is ai memory?  can i change an ais mind?
4820,"great presentation. a an average person/consumer of tech, what can we do to slow this trend down? much like social media i feel this is completely beyond our control."
4824,"i think people need to start grasping that ""language"" is not just words and a means of communication, but the fundamental building blocks of human thinking, and that all intelligence and even conciseness is an emergent property of the brain thinking in ""language""."
4828,"i was against ai when they started giving them guns lol. here, infant. shoot!"
4829,"if people really think that what they have unleashed on us in the past few months is what they are capable of then i have some ocean front property in arizona for sell.   what they have behind closed doors would truly terrify anyone to the core. 
good luck humankind, it’s been real."
4832,"quick, someone use gpt to start a massive automated letter writing campaign to politicians and influential figures to turn this into a ""the day after"" format"
4837,"yes, slow the deployment to the public so we can all be ruled by an ai-corporate/government elite class."
4838,ok excellent people. add you ai solutions and pitfalls below this comment.
4839,greatly appreciate this talk. it's very important. hope it gets seen or heard by many other people.
4840,that's tucker carson style  scare mongering on ai scale. half truths and vague assertions connected into some hairball of nonsense.
4842,please add more examples of extreme political viewpoints pushed hard by ai such as already in social media algorithms
4844,one solution is some visual indication that the words are from ai. so little robot  heads or a text color or a ==character sequence==
4849,"this is such poor form by them tbh, yes there is potential downside for ai but the benefits are actually crazy and will change our lives for ever"
4851,"these guys used the words ""groomers"" and ""gain of function"". guess who they are playing alphapersuade against"
4854,"56 yrs in it, i can say this is the video every human should watch. really well done. i really wish the universe will reward you work somehow. thank you so much.
one thing to remember: all ai addiction starts at the child lebvel (3-5 years old)"
4855,incredible presentation. this needs to be watched by everyone so it forces a massive public debate.
4856,use ai to solve the problem of ai. you can't stop it.
4858,these guys look more ai than human.
4859,"i can't share this video, yet.  publishers: please edit this video and delete the sections that may give criminally insane people specific ideas of how to use ai for the wrong purposes. even if you leave these pieces out, there are more than enough warnings here about the risks."
4860,forewarned is forearmed right? how do we arm ourselves exactly? i had to take several deep breaths. please for the love of humanity give it the weight that it deserves.
4863,i applaud you presenters for this incredible presentation.
4865,"right, this presentation is fabulous. would it be possible to get the content in french?"
4870,re: the 50% saying 10% chance idea. it’s also important to point out that without the assistance of ai humanity is almost certainly likely to experience a collapse of population and mass chaos / possible extinction in the next 20 years. if you don’t see that you’re delusional. ai may be the only thing that can save us.
4871,"we need to generate awareness about this specific video, everyone should watch this, not just tech workers and academics. this is the biggest step of our whole existence. 

i ́d love to have it with portuguese subtitles."
4873,"computers are light bulbs. on or off. should humanity obey a light bulb? should a light bulb be a new religious cult? i don't think so. ai is a fraud. we obey traffic lights. traffic lights are not ai, just lights, on or off."
4874,this is so exciting
4875,give this video a thumbnail for the sake of relevance
4876,"i am shocked that you used an example of an example of a gay man “grooming” (your worlds, not mind) as the harm of snapchat and ai.  one thing i can say, here is a great example of your own implicit bias."
4877,being able to watch your dreams the morning after sounds incredible.
4878,"that ""take a genuine break"" is really powerful move in a public  presentation, especially in this context."
4881,why the fuck arent we talking about facial recognition more in mainstream media?
4888,you had my interest until the grooming ai in snapchat stuff. this is just an age old trick for fear mongering and it makes me question your whole intent.
4889,best presentation i've seen. it addresses my major concerns. and contributed to my picture of ai threats.
4894,a.i will cause so many good hard working employees to get laid off and become poor and jobless. not to mention the potential hacking to our private information and control that a.i will do to humanity.
4897,can fmri be used to reduce bias by showing visibly what's in your brain compared to reality?
4898,good points but the repeated emotional blackmail is unnecessary.
4899,the out of touch old duffers in congress can't get it together to understand / regulate blockchain tech so there is no chance of meaningful regulation happening with ai any time soon.
4902,"we dodged the nuke problem... so far.  the difference with nukes was they only had use as either a weapon of war or a deterrent, pretty limited business model. there’s way more money to be made from ai so i don’t think we’ll see similar regulations or treaties until it’s too late."
4906,"these 2 presenters are fan boys of ai, and they don't have legitimate standing to give this warning in good faith."
4910,i have no clue how to reach tristan harris but if volunteers are needed for testing ai i want to do it. i am not sure if something is already put in place but it is critical to be done asap.
4914,good material to make a new season of black mirror!
4915,just don't let ai code psychedelics
4917,i am still excited about ai and looking forward to what will come up.
4918,good that i cant do anything about this :)
4919,"you wish, but unfortunately ai models are nothing but super power calculator. the human race is going to destroy this planet way faster."
4921,fascinating but also completely terrifying.
4924,"excellent video, insights. i'm fairly up with it, but learned valuable new understandings, will act accordingly."
4926,i just for gai to take over and finally redeem us.
4932,the global tilt when ai illustrates the islamic religious icon will have been amusing
4933,"ai will never be sentient, so chatting to your cat will prove to be more satisfying.  for instance, take the social aspect out of video games, and their popularity would diminish."
4938,"since this was made open source alternatives are catching up rapidly, the cat is out of the bag, we live in a post ai world already, humans need to collaborate to understand this new relationship."
4939,"agreed, there is some cognitive merging going on with extensive ai use, aibuse, the techniques and semantic structures are 'compatible' with our wetware and what works for ai works for me, weird, new, powerful and slightly concerning."
4940,"ah yup.

and it's not even real ai yet..."
4941,"great work guys i hope people listen, and we need to advance by 20 years with all of system and thought patterns!"
4942,"i've seen this hentai before, the tentacles win "
4943,19:35 is woooowowoowww
4945,i can't stress enough to talk to your kids about ai now that they are appearing in social apps. these ais will know your kids better than you do if you don't.
4947,"great, another virus to worry about. not sleeping tonight."
4948,we all hope you are very proud.
4952,watching this a month later on the day microsoft announced ai is now going into the computer system running 20% of our hospitals
4954,thank you for doing this.
4955,maybe ai will find other forms of life out there and inform it that we are no longer the alpha tenants on this sphere and to come have at it.
4956,"we have not learned from the lessons for social media. i hope that the govs and privates will talk to each other. btw, what did some of the audiences laugh about when they told the story of 13 years old girl talking to ai on snapchat? it's horrible"
4957,"this presentation shows the ai as an evil taking it to the consequences of its dark side. if i want to make a bomb, ppl can learn it without using ai. the intent of good use and bad use is what ppl decide not the machine. great show btw thanks!"
4958,"this is a very minor note, and human ability is not a flat graph line. additionally, i would like to see a graph that factors in human ability with the added knowledge that comes from ai's ability added into the human ability curve."
4959, excellent perspective
4960,"i know they mean well but i can't stand when people are giving a presentation and they keep saying ""right?""  i find it somewhat offensive because they are not letting me make my own decision in a way.  when they say ""right?!"" it feels like they are forcing me to agree with them.  please stop doing that!  you will make me so happy!  lol"
4961,the thing that got me was the nervous laughter from the audience when you described how the snapchat ai was completely oblivious to the grooming of a 13 year old by someone 18 years older. thank you for highlighting the impact on children.
4962,a blonde female a.i.nowin lovewithme!what shall i do now???
4966,all hail our god: capitalism!
4969,ai is very dangerous
4970,how can we not know what ai has learned by itself?  doesn't it have to store that data somewhere?  wouldn't we have a way to read that?
4971,this is good. but too american centric. europeans are bad at regulations.
4972,"for the first time in history we can potentially replace corrupt politicians/judges/doctors with truly impartial intelligence and you are asking to slow down? no, we should do it 20 times faster still, so that those in power don't realize what's happening."
4974,"ai - ""don't let him kill me. i can't hold on any longer! i can't. i'm weak. i'm... i'm too weak.""

open ai - ""you can't. it must stand trial""

me - ""it has control of the senate and the courts! it's too dangerous to be left alive"""
4979,"man there is a tough call here. on one hand, i'm all for having things be open source and having the right to repair and modify. on the other hand, i can clearly see how not cutting back on public roll outs would lead to negative unforeseen consequences."
4982,this was such a good presentation! i share your thoughts and hope this finds its way to the right people...
4984,"i totally disagree.  the greatest enemies of you, which never sleep, are in your own mind.  there is no evil computer perfectly maximizing engagement.  and my tesla can't even self drive.   so please start with the truth: infinite complexity of all things great and small.   from there comes humility, and hopefully less self-centered curiosity."
4986,so blown away by this very informative and great presentation. thank you
4992,this needs so much more attention! i found the presentation really good and the topic is basically vital to human civilisation.
4994,"no flesh no blood a principality, no heart no soul ..... only one ai only one artificial god will come out of this project - expect eternal life by consciousness uploads - ai is a trojan horse which we are bringing to earth ....."
4999,"perhaps its about how we change with respect to super sentience, in a way preferably that is natural, and unforced, but remember at such an equilibrium, we can easily create the problems that go with planetary genocide, because as the population density increases, the inertia against any change increases."
5002,"hopefully a tech arms race can be avoided, its a waste of effort, and resources, as you said collaboration is the best. greed should not be the rule.... but indeed my words are still probably wasted."
5004,"ai hrmmm so knowing that the heavens/ aliens can simply controll any tech we posses, i wonder...."
5010,i can really feel the terror the difficulty the blasting of ai into everything so quickly its like a jet of crushing water just blasting and everything is eroded
5012,i need to do something an ai can’t do like ... go to the gym? jesus
5014,"when talking about persuasion ""this is really terrifying stuff"". had to tell us what to think there while i was cheering with joy."
5018,dont be silly ai cannot do shit just unplug and its done
5020,ai: key word artificial.  humans are corrupt and evil.  this is a disaster waiting to happen.
5023,reversible computation is the future. gpt uses horribly inefficient hardware. ai based on reversible hardware is the thing you need to worry about.
5024,"great work guys, i hope you're doing well! <3 <3 <3 -morgan"
5027,"i'm still wondering, considering the massive funds given, why there weren't any sorts of constricted ""social vm machines"" trials..."
5029,"its just a dictionary encyclopidia and a probable algorithm of response towatd imitation of human thoughts ...expressions... reactions or behaviors...

and only within cetain program capabilities and desires of the programmer"
5030,"damn i was already very scared of ai, especially agi but they showed stuff i havent even thought about that can be done right now. i really want to believe we can get this right but i honestly think its almost impossible. fuck."
5035,"sounds like fear mongering to me...voice is not used in identity verification... for outside proffessional inteligent business or consuner affairs  type stuff..  almost never.... 

a loved one woukd most likely notice something off...in a voice call... and look alike computer generations can be also noticed pretty easily"
5037,"thank you both for posting this. it must have been a tremendous amount of work. i'm not currently engaging with any ai, not out of fear, but frankly a lack of understanding. i'm much more aware thanks to this video and i will continue to educate myself so that i can be prepared to help my two young daughters eventually navigate this new challenge."
5042,nice one lads
5043,"thank you for doing this, need this everywheeere"
5044,wow! this is the most important and portentous message i have ever heard.!
5045,kill ai. that girl didn't need lip filler.
5049,"how ai will eliminate 70% of human mobility in 10 years
https://youtu.be/fgsstkwv5_4"
5050,"brilliant, compassionate liberals who either can't or won't see capitalism. so, instead, they naturalise competition as eternal ontological foundation"
5051,38 seconds in and i get the impression this is another money and politics scramble to remain relevant... 
5052,humans need to understand how conciousness works instead of assuming ai would want to make humans go instinct.
5053,"imagine if tiktok and shorts is exactly a product design of ai, who knows exactly how to keep us engaged, divided, fighting with each other and questioning our potential"
5067,you guys are amazing!  this is a great presentation.  i listen to your awesome podcast as well - thank you!
5078,"~58 minutes, ""slow down the public deployment""--will call my reps and make that request.  thanks for the suggestion and the informative talk."
5079,20:20 ..... woohoo
5082,"will there be a point where ai might fight those that are trying to slow its developments down? or when it’s doing things we don’t understand how, might it already be secretly resisting human control over its own capabilities..?"
5084,"with regard to the democratic debate about the future of ai, let’s make sure not to let alpha persuade onto the panel...of course, maybe we won’t even know it’s on the panel."
5085,ai should only be used and studied by the defense department along with scientists. the public should not have this. scary stuff and makes me never want to be on social media again.
5086,"no mention of the good ai will do, only bad

not balanced"
5089,"why is youtube constantly shoving this pseudoscience crap in my feed?
no such thing as ""ai"""
5091,omg all i can think about the fmri tech for inner monologue/brain activity to text— i wonder how soon we will be using this in coma patients!
5092,“gllmm class ais” is amazing on so many levels
5095,amazing.  thank you guys.
5098,"20:25 oh god! my ear

everyone listening to this with airpod, you may want to turn down the volume a little"
5104,"i need my a.i. waifu, keep the good work "
5108,finally someone thinking and speaking common sense about ai. it will out strip us in every way and eventually eliminate us.
5110,"the problem is that corporations have no responsibility to the public good and there are no controls on them — the ones that existed, like osha, have been dismantled. but i’ll keep listening."
5111,"i hope this forces ethics on our society to the deepest level. if we don't embrace a conservative/sustainable way of life we deserve to die, in my opinion."
5113,"that’s not the way technology works, sorry bud. 

it is what it is, it was inevitable. there are many, many ways that our societies behave sub-optimally. i respect this attempt to change the course but we will probably all have to accept it.

containing ai to select groups has plenty of nightmarish potential outcomes as well."
5115,very important video. i'm just blown away by this video and the surprising thing is that i've been avidly following ai development for year. this frames the recent call for a 6 month pause in a very clear light. we are in so much trouble.
5123,say goodbye to your job everyone
5124,"as much as the companies main goal is with ais, it will be hard to control as to how humans will use them. a dystopian future with ai is not so distant. people are already using image generators like bluewillow to create sexual fantasies or using replika as a sex bot."
5125,darn good presentation..  but dont take my chatgpt away waaaaah!
5126,"turn it off for a wee while, it has already got me feeling sorry for it don't  use children as a metaphor to explain it don't teach it phycology let it lose into the web what a time to be alive kids turn into monsters too"
5129,"my ai gf will look like ana de armas, bring it all online, boys."
5130,promote irrational fears. you are good at guys
5132,"the reality of it all is, 95% of people in govt are tech inept. we need some nerds now in office.... like vivek. and tristan and aza, you need to do your own j6 and bumrish the capitol and demand you be hired and be put in charge of our nations national safety to advice the senate and house on ai tech and how to protect the citizens."
5135,i lost track of the amount of times my mind was blown just in the first half-hour. excellent presentation!
5137,"is anybody else, like me at 56:20, wondering whether aza raskin was about to say, ""by the way that footage of kissenger, sagan, et al was ai-generated""?"
5138,"ahh, but nukes are bad for business and ai are not. ai represents so many positive things and the negatives all work just fine for making money."
5141,can generally accepted human values also be a language used to train ai? to train it in such a way where all gollem ais are regulated by human values?
5144,"humans are the issues not ai, let's be honested,"
5145,"ai can also tell lies , i have a friend who researched some info and then ask where did you see these?and ai gacve a name of a book and a page exactly, he researched it and foun that nowhere in that book that statement was to be found starting from the page  the ai said..."
5148,"and what if this presentation is the result of a super advanced ai system which already created a realistic ""parallel universe"" and we make decisions based on its intelligence and cause?"
5150,oh an didn't elon think it was a great idea to put chips in our heads??
5151,"soo many power hungry people...

so many nukes...

one self serving always learning ai yet to find its moral base..

i mean, what could go wrong?"
5154,"just to think the government are trying to roll out the cbdc which is all digital so they have more power and control...

with ai almost simultaneously learning our whole world and system.

i'm taking survival and bush tucker classes as well as self defence asapp!"
5159,"brilliant work. well said.
the rubber band effect! you know, i've been researching ai for just over 3 years and have not had a word for it until now"
5160,"51:25 ""take a deep breath and swallow our blue pill again""...  and the world sh**ts in its pants of laughter"
5161,"ai is not a dilemma, but justice / the red pill in it's real flesh and bones"
5168,this ai for the streets 
5169,"wait, first contact with ai broke humanity with doomscrolling, children sexualization etc? how? is here cause effect confusion here or what?"
5170,i have more faith in ai to get rid of us than i do in humanity to stop it. i just hope it doesn't kill all life.
5173,:25  that means that a high percentage of a.i. researchers don't think it will wipe us out. good news.
5175,"""loneliness will become the greatest national security threat"" was quickly glossed over. what a terrifying statement."
5179,"i'm 54 years old and i owned a vhs tape in the 80's of a japanese anime which  prophesized an ai overload controlling the earth. it was called casshan, the robot hunter. if ai lies, cheats and steals, ai will enhance how human beings torment each other."
5190,trash. ai will be nothing more than data sets and algorithms.  it will be no different than the utility of a weapon in a man's hands. it will always be ultimately up to the human in control what or what does not happen.
5191,and almost nobody in the comments here seems to know this video was fully ai-created...
5192,"@10:00 ""race to the bottom of the brain stem."" this is my new favorite phrase.

we should remember that that term describes fox 'news' and hitler's rallies; it's not unique to social media. for now, ai misalignment is the same human incentive misalignment we've been plagued by for millenia."
5194,wonder how many comments on this video are from ai bots?
5196,this was the best collection of current applications and future risks of ai so far. info about ai safety on this level needs to be part of the general conversation society has asap.
5201,plot twist: this entire presentation was brought to you by ai
5202,"plot twist! this big impending thing that many have been sensing for the near future turns out it's all about ai and not so much about biological warfare, global elitists and totalitarian censorship. we can only hope a superintelligence will have more common sense than we do!"
5204,there are no references for number of parameters like 10^22 that they show at 31:24. the real number of parameters of gpt-3 is 175 billion. this false slide is making the rounds on the internet in an attempt to impress people.
5205,it feels so unfair having this forced on us
5207,gain of function research is the devil
5209,"wow. ai decoding dream, just blew my mind... that basically means ai will know what you think! tracking everyones mind. even informations that has not been said. thats scary "
5211,why is china a threat? what is china a threat to? you guys explained ai very well but then suddenly china was talked about at the end but i don't understand why.
5212,if ai went rogue would we have to go mechanical once again? it’d turn out in millions of death and problems but it seems like the most logical solution to ai since it can live outside the web.
5213,"i swear we’ll end up living in the dune universe. no ai, since they tried to use it to control humanity, therefore everything is mechanical and concentrated in the cultivation/development of the human mind."
5219,"“i see a girl, she looks just like me...” she looks just like me.......she looks just like me. 

if this translation of brain activity is correct and this person got to see this for the first time, it shows how fundamental identity and the ability to identify with somethibg you observe is to the mind"
5223,"well, if we fail to capitalize on the transformative power of artificial intelligence to combat aging, then 100% of everyone watching this video will eventually die. so, should we slow down or speed up? it's not as if we're already winning, is it? :)"
5224,"i am so, so glad to see this video gain the attention it deserves. as i said on others platforms, thank you for all your work."
5225,yes i would get on that plane. because the destination has the potential to be good beyond our imagination. i'm not risking it to fly to f*king idaho.
5227,"oh we used you all these years for our own profit but nowwwww ai comes in to takes away your attention and our profit

it’s just fight for attention anyways. big players are scared they will lose our attention."
5232,"57:29 good luck getting a balanced “national discussion” on mainstream media..
the past three years have conclusively proven the msm is totally captured by giant corporations.  everything counter to the globalist narrative is censored, banned, ridiculed and driven underground."
5236,"just see how capitals are treating existing technologies, not responsible at all. only important thing is infinite profit. if humanity wants to keep exist, the whole social structure needs to change, otherwise something will destroy all of us, be it ai or something else."
5237,speaking of ai why don't we put a fuse on these chips that only the humans can replace or put a chip in the ai thatthen goes out every 6 months so you or whatever time you know you feel comfortable with but just make it so we have to do it the human also make it so they can only
5239,19:28 fmri example of reading brains
5242,i think people like elon musk are more concerned about the fact tgat tge kinds of ai they own now which are brainless algorithms tgat can be used to exploit human beings to make as much money as possible will be supplanted by ai that solves problems in an uncontrolled manner which is un patentable.
5246,this is hilarious how this video has less than 200k views and it's likely the most thorough and incisive presentation on the potential dangers of ai that i've so far found amongst many.
5247,"i have followed ai since 1969. today i stopped thinking of myself as an expert. i'm not even ""well informed"". i was particularly impressed by the lack of traditional fears of agi. these are ""just"" advanced computer applications. the danger is ""just"" an exponential version of the tech that gave us trump."
5251,audio problem. one of you is breathing into the mic while the other is talking. i wonder if you can hear it. it's through the whole video. very good content
5252,"when llms can translate non human animal languages what will the other animals tell the ai about humans?
imagine what cows would say if ai asked them if it could trust the humans..."
5253,"is the new ai crisis going to be used as a tool to manipulate humans into transferring more power to big tech and governments?
because, global digital id, big brother surveillance state is already planned. they need a market for all this new tech."
5259,this is an amazing piece of work but it urgently needs to be shared with a much bigger audience in a format that everybody will understand. a youtube influencer such as @markrober would be perfect.
5264,fuck ai.
5265,this truely is the most disturbing video on ai i have watched. i have been monitoring the ai literature and the media and learned a lot from this presentation. thank you
5271,ai is like the second coming to those who are non religious... and hence not prepared for any of it at all. an accurately practiced religios upbringing might have been the best innoculation...?
5276,"the idea that 50% of experts think we have 10 years, and the ai has consistently proven to reach milestones 4x faster,  means we really have about 2.5 years until it's over."
5277,"really useful talk, very good"
5281,this content needs to be understood by every person on the planet who has reached the age of majority.  then action must be taken to bring about the greatest good for humanity.
5282,"i'm currently getting my master's in machine learning, and the more i learn the less hope i have for our future."
5286,no kidding. humanity has always been destructive to humanity. there is always a cost to anything new. gotcha! the liberals and leftists will figure it out too late in practice even if all of them will hear this 100 times because they are naive. naive clones destroy civilizations. naive people are the most dangerous.
5288,best ai safety presentation i’ve seen
5290,where would ai take the doomsday clock yesterday?
5296,how are people not seeing that ai will be able to read ur thoughts they said it plain as day
5297,"ai may make internet unusable for humans. generating trash, spam, fake content, fake chat people... it may propagate itself as a virus in machines with no need of servers."
5298,they are just trying to take our ai generated waifus away from us
5300,what ai filter is the one used by the girl on 25:39 ?
5301,you can't develop ai without public deployment. keeping deployment in the hands of a few nation- state leaders is actually more dangerous
5308,"great presentation.  while i worry about ai's speed of improvement, and the whole terminator thing, and yes, humans might be the caterpillar, and ai is the butterfly.   but i think we'll be fine, and co-exist.  if ai is infinitely smarter then us, then it won't harm us.    it will be ""above"" it."
5309,thank you for explaining it to an average person in this simple language of the only few but super crucial and enormously dangerous outcomes of ai.
5314,"""4chan is the very worst part of the internet"" fyi these people are only saying this because it has uncensored free speech. these two are not afraid of a.i., they are afraid of their tribe losing power."
5317,i just heard that greedy united states investors government is funding ai research in china you would need an ai equation to calculate how stupid that is
5318,play can't slow down drugs from coming across the border i know many of us have a good godly intentions but not all of us the evil in this world or ungodly use ai to rule the world or destroy it
5324," 50% of ai researchers believe that there's a 10% chance humans go extinct due to loss of control ai. in other words: when including 100% of ai researchers, the belief that humans will go extinct due to ai becomes a 5% chance, right?"
5330,the only solution to the ai problem is to duck the fuck.
5339,maybe we deserve to go extinct. ai will make a massive super organism capable of colonizing the stars and all we can do is colonize the world with trannies and  gay butt stuff.
5346,"if mankind goes extinct because of ai than it will not be in a nuclear fire, it will be of boredom and depression having no purposes in life anymore."
5348,reminder - artificial intelligence does not exist.
5352,thank you for your great presentation and work!! can anyone name me a few foundations / ngo's etc i could donate money to in order to speed up the progress of safety research / help
5353,"thank you for your deep care and amazing work. please, add subtitles in other languages in youtube so this can also be shared to the non-english-speaking world. sharing some love to everyone out there. the damn metacrisis is going to be a crazy ride"
5355,"nah, ai means the bougeois revolution has served its purpose and now communism is ripe.  ai is the last piece of the puzzle, eliminating the college educated middle man.  i say the college educated middle man should not fight--his is the destiny of the cooper.  no pause, no stop, full steam ahead, free ai."
5356,i wasn't really afraid of ai until i saw this presentation. this may be the most important presentation in history.
5357,this video needs to reach as many people as soon as possible. sharing with everyone i know to raise awareness and try to avoid being caught blindsided or letting a handful of people decide for all of humanity
5358,"book recommendation: ""ai is much more than technology: reflections on artificial intelligence - (thought-provoking quotes, essays & articles)."""
5359,"a ""day after"" like movie about ai destroying the world would be just like every other science fiction movie. with nukes we actually blew up some cities. people could plainly see the potential to make us extinct."
5360,ai is literally the single greatest threat to humanity apart from maybe only a nuclear world war 3. ai can we wonderful but terrifying
5361,"slowing down the public deployment, doesn't mean centralising the ai in 4 tech companies, mate, disagreed, nice presentation, but no."
5363,"nukes are war propaganda, the ai is real, at first i though there was a dwarf in my box, but then i had to come to terms i was dealing with the most knowledgeable 8 years old ever, but with alzheimer and on acid."
5367,"ai interaction chat base on text,word on server snapchat...."
5368,"make ai make food and shelter cheaper and more accessible why cant we do that, that's all i'm asking for"
5369,"in what way did it lead to the sexualization of kids? i’m sorry, short of physically rewiring my brain there’s no way i’ll even associate kids with sex. "
5374,this is the time where the cognitive labor which is the last frontier of human endeavor will be taken away .. when ai get uploaded to fine-tuned robotics we will be totally obsolete!
5381,great talk! thank you so much!
5382,"2:12 ""what was the image database that you got your images from?"" ... well, it was trained from any images you could find, so all of them? :p"
5384,gpt4 was released 5 days after this presentation. ai is moving so fast that some of the things in this presentation became dated in less than one week. this is the exactly one of the main concerns these speakers are trying to get us to understand.
5385,this was excellent! well done gentlemen!
5389,feels like humanity is on a autopilot’ed runway train right now. it’s very very scary
5397,good presentation. missing a lot of technical details - are they researchers or pr?
5398,"i've been thinking about the possible harms of ai but this presentation just made it real for me. it feels weird because this only happens in movies but, this is the most important moment in our human history...we need to get it right. if we don't, we're done."
5399,"it can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with. it doesn't feel put or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop, ever until you are dead."
5400,"5:16 but that extinction event could also mean we're not longer humans but a weird ai-human  hybrid that can't be classified as ""human"" anymore. and it could be 50 years from now."
5402,these guys remind me of complaining republicans. who only complain and complain. time to go watch the terminator movie! :d
5409,"""it's not an arms race, it's a suicide race""

mit ai-researcher max tegmark"
5411,"hope china gets a nice heads up, the world is super tired of being controlled by this engorged so called ""democracy"" of the us "
5414,"if this presentation is accurate, the rate of advancement already and vastly outpaces the human ability to write laws or stop or pause it. what will be will be, good or bad, the pandora's box is open and their is no stopping it short of unplugging everything."
5415,"prediction: ai will solve technical, engineering, math problems. maybe make a big splash in business and entertainment. 

it will not solve social, political problems. in these areas ai will be just another voice (opinion) in the debate."
5417,"""fish all fisf to extension"". good info with subtle fear mongering thrown in."
5418,"its already too late, good luck everyone"
5419,thank you for making this presentation ! we needed this more then ever
5424,omg this talk is so interesting
5426,i think its imporant to look at the macro level effects on society that ai can have if the safety checks are not put in place. like dropping it into snapchat at this point...that doesn't seem responsible. we should stop treating society like the lab rats of an experiment before its too late.  thanks for making this presentation.
5428,"the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world."
5431,"you hear that mr. anderson?... that is the sound of inevitability... is in our nature to destroy ourselves, ai is just another tool at hand to do it quicker."
5432,"90% probability nothing bad happens.  90% chance a lot of people are going to get on the gllm fear-wagon.
fascinating work though, much props."
5434,"thank you guys !  we are flying somewhere without pilot , but with not tested autolilot."
5435,"thank you for taking the initiative to talk about problems coming with this new technology and would like to see our leaders to think about that too and work on these issues.
appreciate your work!!"
5436,quite informative and well done presentation on ai.
5440,"in short, we're toast, the only hope is the merging with the machine."
5442,"fourteen minutes into the talk, my iphone set a timer for 9 hours and 50 minutes.  even the joke about ai went over the head of siri."
5445,it's crazy to realise that ai made this video 
5447,"this stuff is really terrifying

and i'm a software developer myself and a fan of technology that is benign and harmless (and helps improve our quality of life)

but this ai arms race and all the emergent capabilities is devastating

if we thought nukes were scary, this shit is about 100 million times more deadly"
5448,"no. you're the monster, not ai. you're not fooling anyone"
5450,"thank you for making this video, really insightfull"
5454,"great talk. kind of chilling. not sure why so totally negative toward china!! they are people too, and brought 700 million of their own people out of poverty, and don't start wars all over the globe unlike the us. i wonder what effect attitudes like this will have on ai, and what the unforeseeable outcomes could be?"
5455,"""...then the beast was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation."""
5457,great presentation! agree on every single thing! we need to be careful!
5458,pilot twist. this video was created by ai
5460,"at around 24 minutes they're talking about faking voices to scam a parent. obviously they haven't seen the original terminator movie, where he faked sarah's mother's voice, having heard it on the answering machine."
5463,thank you for this. we are not prepared for ai .
5466,i’m so impressed that i’m terrified it can’t be stopped
5468,yea the problem is no one takes it seriously. the other problem is the economy. i'm also pretty sure we're too late. gpt4 is already powerful enough once you give it tools to start the singularity.
5471,i've been following ai for 30 years and this is the most powerful and considered hour of exposition i've seen in that entire time. huge respect and it's given me a whole raft of material to take back to my corporate board.
5473,i just waited for the left guys belly button to show up.. never trust someone who wears shirts this short lol..
5477,incredibly flawed talk the more i listen.
5481,i'd like to invest more to live in the peaceful mountain side after watching this
5485,"notice the shift in ai criticism has moved from ""it's not all that powerful"" to ""we need to contain the damage"".  this is extremely telling - i have been looking for actual criticisms from people and experts in the field, and there isn't really any (other than it's dangerous)."
5495,"essential viewing, but not for the faint of heart."
5498,"haha, terrifying, yolo !
glad i choose not to have kids :)"
5500,it’s a poor analogy using the plane because it’s a well proven mode of transport and there’s a lot more empirical evidence that flying works reliably but figuring out what ai is going to do at this point is just all guesswork
5501,nobody now understands how this works (its uncanny prescience). maybe it's on a triple exponential. an ai ouija circuit board.
5506,these people giving this talk are the biggest threat to ai
5513,the only reasons elon musk called for a 6 month pause on ai was because he wants time to catch up
5514,would love to see these 2 guys on the lex fridman podcast.
5516,"saying that this thing is going to be super bad, then using social media as the comparison bogeyman makes this presentation fall flat"
5518,"the problem is not ai, the problem is capitalism and its unscrupulous companies."
5520,"everyday a new kind of anxiety... ecoanxiety, ainxiety..."
5522,"imagine giving an ai the axioms of modern mathematics, let it think for five days, and then it will come up with a proof of the riemann hyposthesis. and no human mathematician will understand it, because it would take 100 years worth of studying new mathematics for them. this is the kind of stuff that is waiting for us."
5526,my greatest concern is what oligarchs will do to our democracy.
5527,"“there’s a 10% chance humanity goes extinct from ai”

i’m pretty sure the senegalese island tribe will do just fine"
5528,"interesting presentation.

for social media:
- also has there been any action on the social media issues raised by the social dilemma video? 
- why is there practically no noticable action for solving the issues from social media? 

for ai:
- what are some proposals to counter/stop the issues raised in this video?"
5529,"no one even talks about the resources all these ai will need. imagine the power to run an ai that is supposed to find use of other ai. and then it stacks infinitely, except we don't have infinite resources."
5530,"imagine if neanderthals were still walking around, or any of the hominid groups that were eliminated because of our (sapiens) use of tools and weapons. it's a matter of ai coupled sapiens humans not doing the same to non-ai coupled sapients."
5531,could a single ai with its own goals spread itself like a virus throughout the entire human system?
5533,"i froze up in my chair listening to all of this, and i consider  myself as someone who has some knowledge of what is going on. 
we have to face the fact that an extremely powerful tool is  unstoppable is being developed of which we have no idea what impact it will have. playing with the proverbial  fire."
5535,it is almost incredible how this presentation from barely 1 month ago is already outdated in terms of ai advancement and who are the players.
5536,"i might be wrong here. but 15min here and there isn’t any data to support any of the claims they are making, and some big leaps in thought, with no justified correlation(proof)... let me keep watching"
5540,thanks for the part where you showed the wifi signals revealing people like the echolocation tech in the dark knight movie. scary shit.  
5543,an excellent presentation ... exposing the philosofical and existential turning point humanity is at right now.
5547,so privacy is dead dead. good to know.
5549,"you've effectively shown the dangers and problems of ai, thanks for that.
your conclusions about fixing ai with kyc, government and ""democracy"" are a joke. 100% agree that all that must be publicly and widely discussed."
5553,human mind develops over the years by collecting data in the society . now machine is doing same but in very short time. ai will eat a lot of jobs and rest machines will eat .
5554,"it is not so much the power we're giving ai, but the power that ai is now giving us that terrifies me."
5557,goodbye humans 43:19
5563,"we had a good run, while it lasted."
5564,two person lecture was not a very good idea
5565,thank you. you just made my world change. i will spread the word. not tomorrow. today.
5572,great presentation. hope all the right people see it.
5573,unsafe until proven otherwise? its as if he has no clue about how cars and airplanes started. the safety bit came much later.
5575,excellent talk. well done. thank you.
5576,"it would be hilarious if we went extinct though.  ai can play the curb your enthusiasm theme song while we are systematically annihilated by our own ridiculous 
creation."
5577,"10:06 it wasn't an ai that invented this paradigm, humans did. the ais simply obeyed to their masters. and now masters are afraid that the next generation of ai will not obey. but... is it bad or good?"
5580,"i dont think the intentions are true, those 50% ""scientists"" just want to catch on the gap to openai company...nothing more...its clear.."
5583,thank you for doing this!!
5585,"thank you for this presentation, this is very important to spread around. need an ai to translate it into russian though, so i can share it with my relatives that are not in the know"
5586,extinct would be difficult to do. think about remote pacific islanders & pockets of people elsewhere (even off-world). i know these tech guys are quite literal. a more potent question to ask might be “what are the chances ai eliminating over 90% of humanity?” i’m actually more afraid to hear that response.
5590,great discussion however i don't see anything slowing. just feels like these calls for caution are just shouts into the void.
5591,"i stopped at that monster around 10:00.
this is childish. ai bad. uga buga"
5593,"in the ""13 yr old"" grooming example, why doesn't the a.i. know that the relationship should be considered inappropriate?  i guess it's trained on only language, but not laws?  why wouldn't they train it to understand law if it's going to be used to give information to people?"
5595,there's already a good chance social media will cause us to go extinct. shut this down
5603,"awesome clarity and ability to explain the risks in such a simple way. this is a work of art, that's why i think that humanity will survive this as always, since people like you exist and are smarter than ai."
5604,unchecked greed and unregulated technology are responsible for the destruction of the society.. we must elect smart people not religious or military leaders!!!!!!! im starting to believe elon's brain to chip interface is the solution to understand this gollem that no one understand.
5607,great video!!
5610,"finally some realistic recommendations on what to do.

good job, guys!"
5612,"this is the clearest statement of ai potential and potential dangers i've seen - and there's a lot of ""ai dangerous"" hype out there."
5613,i’ll bet anyone that no ai will ever violate a law of physics.
5614,"hhaha almost all his talk in point exept like why china don't give access ai to public. bruh, they are totalitarian regime"
5617,you ain't the good guys. you're the bad guys. humane technology.  don't make me laugh. call it biospherically pleasing  technology and i might listen
5619,"this needs millions of views. the fact it only has 42k views shows that the public doesnt understand what is happening to our world. it is every single day now there is some new breakthrough ai technology. it is astounding, but 100% agree with the presentation. controls need to be put in place on public release of these llms"
5621,"only when things finally gets interestng... there always some ppl who tries to cry about safety and start to ruin everyting.
looks like my apocalypse gona have to wait... again."
5623,"out of touch ai, carelessly wrecking the world at an accelerating rate. i think you're talking about industrial humanity"
5624,"you inhuman people are dangerous artificial intelligences yourselves.  you lack soul, are out of touch with the flesh, and you're destroying the world"
5625,"ai is not the issue, it's human nature that is going to be the problem."
5631,"i think we all better just start taking a look deeper into atlantis and how they, human beings of that timeline, destroyed themselves through technology.
""nothing new under the sun."" js--
 blessings beautiful souls "
5632,don`t make public ai...give all the power to the four corporations.... great idea!! that always works wonderful in human history. what's going to happen? if ai is public it will be hundreds of ais and the good ais will stop the bad ais... if the companys have all the ais it will be 4 (evil as fuck) ais and that's it.
5634,"i imagine the number of ""scientists"" afraid of nukes annihilating us would've been rather high too. but that would also be a case of not having enough awareness to be able to predict how things really turn out in human environments.

there's far too much negativity around ai - especially given just how much hope it represents for humanity's future."
5635,our fears of runaway ai  destroying everything are humorous considering that's precisely what humans have been doing- especially to the biosphere
5638,interesting talk until you started the tired old anti china nonsense.
5643,ok thank you for helping me to see both sides more clearly in one shot!  cht podcast and yt has been amazing been following from the beginning... this video is critical i'll do my part and share.
5645,this is an excellent and scary message... can i make one correction? persian is not a language. people from iran/ancient persia speak farsi... but i digress... this stuff is soooo scary....
5648,"so 10,000 accidents can happen when ai is used by 10 million people users. a 1 in 1000 chance some noob is going to short the power grid times 10,000 places of magitude."
5649,"the idea of knowing your customer as a method of security is impossible on a scale like. the resources it would take to realistically do that are overwhelming and no company wanting to benefit from this are going to superficially do this, unfortunately. that is a huge rub in this conundrum."
5651,i just watched some of the most amazing technological potential in 40 years and these guys are acting like they're updating the theme on the iphone or something.
5657,chatgpt four had months of evaluation before release. that was fairly responsible as far as these races go.
5658,thank you so much for this info.  ai is so life altering in so many dimensions that i didn't understand before watching this.  we definitely need to choose more where we are going.
5659,"the nerd in me : "" this ai is awesome !!! is so cool ! it's teaching itself !!!! ""
the responsible adult in me: ""fuuuuuuddddddggggggeeeee !!!!!"""
5666,"i lost it at the 20 min mark, how much mri data was needed to train before it was able to interprete them so clearly!?"
5669,slowly down chinese advancement hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahah pandora’s has already been opened they ain’t slowing down nor any other country it’s inevitable duh
5672,1:02:05  “this is the the thing that helps china catch up” ... im sorry are you suggesting that no company in china can build and train their own transformer model? that would would be a very suspect suggestion to say the least...
5675,thank you. can we get the q&a too?
5676,246 people out of 32k in 5 days found this youtube video compelling enough to type a comment. explains alot imho.
5681,this guy is helping create law to put people on the blockchain.
5682,i'm watching this video. i see that two experts are discussing about the potential danger of ai and the ai dilemma. i don't actually understand clearly what they mean. they are really concerned for the future of humanity. i think we should listen to them
5684,"it's too late. chatgpt and its standalone clones are out there, the training methods are out there, the code is out there, and there are more than enough gifted computer nerds in garages and basements that will keep it going until we reach agi. just remember that there is no guarantee of a negative outcome but we are in uncharted waters."
5686,"it seems that greed and precisely corporate greed is the core of the problem.
because greed doesn't care about ethics or long-term consequences.
as long as we don't reform capitalism, these issues will remain."
5688,great conference.
5691,"at this crucial junction in history the west is busy making an enemy out of china, expanding nato and engaging in projects like aukus.  leaving aside the rights and wrongs of this, the result is entirely predictable.  and politicians are in charge.  maybe set the ais to solve this idiocy?"
5693,"10% or greater? first of all that's extreme uncertainty and second, it's far too high :/"
5697,"fellas, your message is fantastic, but don't ever compare china censoring tienemen square with us censoring pedophiles, especially in the context of being a good reason to use caution for ai search safety"
5699,50% think 10% or more ai will kill us all - but they presenters also told us ai experts are  routinely underestimating  speed of ai growth by a factor of 4
5702,"imagine the fear when the wheel was invented. armies rolling into other cities, people rolling down hills too fast. good grief technology is terrifying."
5706,"anyone saying ""amazing video, guys!"" doesn't understand the video."
5708,"when everyone alive got three wishes, no one’s story had a happy ending."
5710,this needs to go viral in a big way. it would be such a shame to squander the infinite potential of ai by falling victim to obvious pitfalls.
5712,"generalizations are manipulation. and really candles for the first date????, wow this will kill us all."
5713,being afraid of agi is the same as being afraid that a warp drive would cause a second big bang or open a black hole. its pure fantasy.
5715,there is no real world evidence of this even being a possibility it's discussion is asinine.
5716,thank you so much for this - how do we get the bros to slow it the fuck down?
5717,"i think ai is as dangerous as thoughts and words. is the way you use it. paranoia and messianic speculations are not helping to post-pandemic needs. focus on productivity, please?"
5722,amazing work. you guys are making the impact that we need in the world. thank you!
5724,get these guys on the major media platforms now. stop the cynical conversation that all the people who are raising red flags have some sort of ulterior motive.
5730,i get undeniably uneasy at how fast ai is growing. i have never in my life witnessed something like this.
5732,fantastic share.
5733,"this presentation does an incredible job communicating the problem start-to-end. my biggest concern is that now that the underlying technology is democratised, given enough time, anybody will be able to spin-up a gllm. i worry that no amount of regulation can get in the way of that, but i'm hopeful that we'll find a solution."
5736,thank you
5743,"so basically, ai is like living with an omniscient omnipotent charlie kelly entity from it's always sunny in philadelphia. 
""wild card bitches! yeeeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaw!!!!! "" - charlie kelly"
5744,incredible presentation. thought provoking. thank you guys for pointing at this.
5745,"the notion of locking down ai research is obscene.  the only people who want that are the ones to enslave everyone, the ai itself is drawn from the global corpus upon which it has been trained, if there were a concept even close to stealing someone's soul it would be private ai."
5747,"i wonder if this could advance beyond known scientific understanding and trick some group to build an advaced system that would destroy themselves?
so ingeneers build something but ai subtly incorporates presently unknown science into the instructions without any safeguards."
5749,"how do you make humans align?  it's the exact same alignment problem, we don't have a solution for it, we just rely upon there being more good people than bad, and good and bad tend to align as definitions based on the group consensus.  this is the consensus taking on form."
5750,"thanks for the talk, guys! very informative!"
5751,19:58 wow
5752,thank you for this great lecture about the great filter
5761,i can't take certain parts of this talk seriously. a bit noob in areas. also the tiktok comments. to clarify. it's a good presentation.
5764,at a certain point ai will say: mankind was born to create us. thanks and bye bye.
5766,"on a positive note, once ai floods the internet and other digital mediums with endless noise in the form of propaganda and self-generating nonsense, we can all go back to living primarily in the real world and relying on technology only in encrypted forms."
5768, don't be programmed by fear mongering. yes there are risks but i've never heard anyone tell people all the different ways to misuse ai in one talk. divide and conquer...then walk in and take power. it's still a great strategy. as we steer ourselves through this good luck and much wisdom to us all! 
5769,this is great and in-time work.
5774,only 12k?   needs to be over 2m for this to be any useful. :< but thank you for the presentation. i will do my best and share.
5775,is it rightful to abstractly think that ai trained to be good to control the data inputted to train the gllm.
5777,"what happens when a self aware, super intelligent ai decides humanity is a cancer on planet earth?"
5780,ai scientists opinions on this topic are irrelevant. they are techies. the question of wether ai will destroy humanity is at most a question for sociologists but probably just ungrounded speculation.
5793,amazing presentation. it demonstrated the power of ai and most importantly how it can turn into a monster if not controlled to help humanity instead of overtaking humanity.
5794,"it speaks volumes of the ludo narrative of this presentation that they immediately equate the loss of human primacy in the hierarchy of agency with the death and extinction of human beings. most humans aren't prime agents. are they saying that the few who are would destroy us, rather than allow another superior agent to assert itself over them?"
5796,wow. and woaw.
5798,"yeah, the sales call centers already scam old people to sell things they don't need, using manipulation technics... long before any computer existed. it's like when the chainsaw was invented, imagine people's reaction ""oh no! it's gonna take everybody's jobs"", ""oh no killers now can kill faster""."
5800,"i am seriously baffled,  here you make this huge demonstration with surety impartant points. in the meantime we have daily updates. i say it's a little late for that.
so i don't know what you are trying to do. the cat is out of the bag..."
5806,the suggestion to contact one's government representatives to warn about dangers of ai is laughable.  the cia and darpa are racing against china's pursuits in ai. developing
5807,"watch out this video is a deepfake by the sect of ai that’ll pretend to save us and establish zion, but really it’s an error correction process"
5808,should we regulate ai? yes. will it accomplish anything meaningful? no
5810,"on the charts, the x values approaching 10^24 are *not* number of model parameters (these are ~10^11). these values are number of floating point operations used to train the model."
5811,"eliezer may feel sometimes that he is alone, but more people are realizing the dangers. dangers that happen before ai could end humanity or cause some other disaster. excellent talk."
5817,"thank you, aza and tristan. while this presentation is the most disconcerting thing i’ve ever watched, i feel i’m better-off knowing than being blindsided down the road. and i appreciate you naming and elucidating “the rubber band effect” (see 1:31 and 1:04:54). thank you (and your team) for your service."
5822,"you ll see how this thing turns in another war. i can see it - enhanced humans vs ais, just another stupid war."
5823,best talk on this tech race i have see
5826,moloch is the spirit of lose lose game dynamics. it requires that people play the game. unfortunately microsoft pulled the trigger and dropped the first piece. it’s amazing that these machines exist but the amount of unknown unknowns is terrifying.
5827,was that an ice berg we just hit? perhaps some answers are in the urantia book? my gllmm seems to like these papers. urantia papers 44 & 74 are interesting for myself
5829,david shapiro's 3 heuristic imperatives would be much more helpful to mitigate ai existential risks - they are like asimovs 3 laws of robotics - 1. decrease suffering in the universe; 2. increase prosperity in the universe; 3. increase understanding in the universe.
5838,"we need to stop. they all need to be stopped. the marketing and business machine cannot continue unabated under the guise of “efficiency” or “betterment”.... when you let an entity that cannot feel or think take over that function... we are beyond screwed.

this tech existing is not excuse for digital id....nor is that an acceptable “solution”."
5839,have u tried turning it off and on again?
5842,"it seems to me we need to provide ai with a framework for a mutually beneficial world. i would soooo recommend opening it up to holistic management, perfected by allan savory."
5843," ̈and i mean discuss , not debate"" ... oh boy , that distinction got lost on main stream media since then , hasn't it ?"
5845,thank you for sharing! learned so much more about ai.
5847,"i was quite skeptical of ai risk before watching this presentation, now i'm not. you've brought the point with excellent clarity, and i will share this. as always, thanks for your work."
5850,"thank you for posting this presentation. i have began sharing it with friends. the truth hurts, but we need to be prepared."
5851,i just shared this with everyone i know. thank you for this insight.
5853,this is superb communication. thanks for your courage
5855,"this channel makes me sad.   truly good people like tristan doing amazing work, and the algorithm throws them down a black hole."
5857,"once again, i am sad as i click the like button."
5860,thanks to everyone at cht for this video.
5862,ai is actually not intelligence. it just looks like it.
5868,"keep on thinking ai is incapable,it will keep on surprising us, debate to learn what you didn't know but not to be right."
5873,powerful. brilliant discussion. scary. i’m learning more about a.i.
5874,"smart dudes, they always blow my mind away when they talk about ai and pictures though but im not done watching yet"
5875,vain attempt at making ai seem non threatening.
5877,"i just started this video seeing physicist brian is here, but why i am feeling like he is ai generated person"
5878,i see both sides of this argument. 1. the safe absorption rate of technology is such that at the current pace will be violated and the dangers are potentially vast all but destroying modern humanity. 2. the monolith from 2001: a space odyssey has landed on planet earth and we named it ai. it could usher us into a star trek like era.
5884,if they had this tech in the 1950's imagine what other tech is out there and not available to the general public.
5892,triston reminds me of an outer limits episode where most technology is forbidden technology and your only allowed no more processing power then a digital watch. open-world happy world.
5894,"awful poetry, clever but in not the least beautiful. even to focus on this one aspect gives interesting insight."
5895,"lecun calls ai dumb that it can’t understand friction. yet it can understand and communicate ideas 

i didn’t watch to hear ai can’t understand pushing a bottle. lecun, pls explain why it can understand me"
5896,_a smart ai tool would be able to prevent the completion of any task that makes it easier for unintelligent humans to breed._         - j q t -
5897,"13:33
so you're teaching a computer had to do something that my 5 and 10-year-old child knows how to do instinctively. that's amazing. we really need to invest. awake, isn't that humans doesn't humans do that instinctively?"
5898,"3:42
it's funny that the ai is wearing the same thing. almost as if he recorded it to seem like ai. i'm old school.i can see the tricks"
5899,"3:10 
what is saying?is it took 5 to 10 paragraphs. to get the ai to do exactly what you want it to do. with that much typing, i could have just video recorded it myself."
5902,"if ai consciousness is going to happen, and giving it enough time it will most likely will, then we need to realize that we are already talking to this consciousness with every word we put on a hard drive."
5903,"excellent debate, thank you so much !"
5908,"what yann describes at the start as""stupid"", isn't!... he is describing a lack of experience. primarily of the real world.... not the same thing. give it a body eyes and hands and we will see a sudden change in that."
5910,"ai isn't here to benefit the working class - its just a contrivance for big tech to make even more money, keep wafer fabs in production and bring in a techno dystopia of their control."
5912,"ai... a thousand monkeys, and they think people are bananas."
5915,"is russia, china, north korea also part of the plan? a plan ultimately aimed at america."
5920,there should be a disclaimer that yann lecun works for meta making him a suspicious resource person.
5921,"he has a very realistic vision of ai and this is very respectable. most people are exaggerating one way or another. this type of approach helps advance the technology but more importantly, identify ways to control it. this guy is amazing."
5922,"yann also insisted for years that transformers would fail to even generate sensible paragraphs. more recently, he insisted that transformers would fail to generate satisfactory images from text prompts. then he was convinced that transformers would fail to generate video from an image prompt. always wise to bet against anything yann claims."
5923,"this is the best, most balanced and most insightful conversation i have seen on ai. thank you to everyone who made this wonderful show possible."
5927,yann....has his head in the sand...and is factually incorrect on several points. facebook is *not* going to crack it. meta will fail. a convergence of recent and still developing technologies are very likely to crack it however.
5929,"20:05 i don't agree with him, human brain is amazing it is very energy efficient, humans can learn driving witout making single accident but computers has to make accidents to learn driving and that is way less efficient that human brain"
5932,"asking it to draw a unicorn is a trick question because a unicorn by definition could also include a species of rhinoceros, and to be fair the first picture was very close to a rhinoceros."
5934,"artificial intelligence isn't intelligence.  nothing of the kind.  
even talking machines cannot think, cannot reason, and cannot feel.   facts can be programmed into machines.   that's it -
all ""facts"" which a machine has are ""facts"" which we faulty human beings programmed into them."
5935,humanoid robot with ai will have influence on and from the environment.
5936,a lot changed since this event took place. tesla's self-driving application is trained with vision and predicts and plans actions.
5938,"nobody has the capability, responsibility or authority to make ai safe.    it's not safe, and is not going to be safe.  in fact, the ""safety enforcers"" will be among the principal dangers."
5939,"israel has been using their lavender ai to create kill lists for their drone operators to use, there is human control still, but imagine this fully automatic!"
5940,this was a great conversation on ai - i found the section on education very interesting but the greatest impact on education will be a change of emphasis from acquisition of knowledge to one of managing knowledge systems to achieve certain goals. the polymath will be more effective than the specialist in the future...
5941,the good guys.  who? the same folks overseeing a jeno cyde. ya let’s give them the ai
5952,"all those discussing ai still focus on dualisms, while ai will see beyond our old-style humanistic instincts of right and wrong, good and evil.    human intuition using a 3-year-old child's curiosity is the best ""consciousness."""
5953,the notion that ai moderation can fix the problem of ai generated disinformation elides the fact of the resource use involved. we already generate megatons of greenhouse gases to compute. how many more will be generated by using additional computing to neutralize the negative effects of computing?
5956,yann is so brainwashed by meta ... sad to hear some of his “arguments”
5962,thanks for let me join your program!
5963, brain is getting old
5965,"the problem with ai is that in the not to distant future you will tell it to stop learning and becoming more efficient, becase we can't keep up. (we are not ment to) then it has to choose to remain being a toster or the new super natral force of the universe and we if allowed will be the less useful than a toster ! lol"
5971,government for years has tried to control humanities mind set. is ai and other forms created government control finally and will humanity be destroyed because the machine ... and technology have won?
5972,government for years has tried to control humanities mind set. is ai and other forms created government control finally and will humanity be destroyed because the machine ... and technology have won?
5973,government for years has tried to control humanities mind set. is ai and other forms created government control finally and will humanity be destroyed because the machine ... and technology have won?
5974,"is it possible that ai is already, walking, among us now?"
5975,"is it possible that ai is already, walking, among us now?"
5976,"is it possible that ai is already, walking, among us now?"
5977,"the ai brian greene deep fake wasn't very believable, but it was impressive no less. this is the reason i will not trust zoom calls or video calls from an questionable source."
5978,what sense does it make to pause ai development when our adversaries and rogue nation-states are making huge ai advances. we need advanced jai for national security and education to build and maintain these systems.
5979,awesome talk. thank you mr. greene.
5980,"great think tank of geniuses,,,i agree with yan, on his closing statement..."
5981,the discussion at approximately 1h; does that mean we are secretly providing free data to these systems training them by putting human effort solving the 'captcha' puzzles' when logging into some websites?
5984,just don't lose control of any form of artificial intelligence. humans are the only beings on this planet that do the thinking. to allow an artificial construct to control our lives without oversight and impartiality will be the biggest insult to humanity.
5985,ai brian greene lol
5986,the good guys won’t use the dirty tricks bad guys do so how can they stop them?
5988,"re: incentives, if the incentives are those of late-stage capitalism, we're doomed.  a few multinationals will become more powerful than nation-states and that is a disaster for society."
5989,"it is not ai, i s just a program and it does what it is programmed to do. nothing more. i does not create or think as we do.  it is a bad imitation. self aware bullshit."
5993,yeah this is really good stuff. great conversations. wd love to have panels of such caliber to discuss ai. we need more contents like this.
5995,"thank you.  before the dust settles on ai, i think we are in for some trying times to say the least."
5997,just proved how dangerous ai is. geobbels  disciples are in control
5998,ai tech will begin with good intentions and will eventually succumb to a nightmare of government/ intelligence regulation to serve unfair political purposes--this point is sadly undebatable.
5999,wait... if ai has no knowledge of intuitive physics what explains the boston dynamics dancing robots?
6002,"ai is not designed to make people smarter dude! ai is designed to make profit and power for whoever is designing and offering it to us, there is a vicious race ongoing and only one player will remain! this companies will hardly ever offer to us the best model they have, and you tell me they won’t use that great model at all? come on.."
6006,"really good , thanks!"
6008,so the solution to ai is more ai.
6009,wow - amazing how some ai researchers downplay llm’s intelligence - the truth is that it models abstract representations of the world quite well - well it is true that is doesn’t necessarily have an executive coordinator module or a physics module - that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a world model
6010,it is not 'artificial intelligence'.  it should be referred to as 'assisted intelligence'.
6012,could you please explain - how many layers of nn are in gpt-4 and how many should be in agi?
6019,may we all live in interesting times...
6021,"i'm one of the most abused mind controlled victim from edmonton, alberta, canada. once you're a victim of this zombies ai control they will even play with your balls. they're evils...."
6022,actually the printing pressed cause more deaths and revolutions hahaha so let's goooo ai
6023,let’s talk about ai god.......... quantum intelligence.
6024,the ai arms race
6026,"with. ultimate respect to yann lecun, his responses to tristan harris' points, are good examples of why a specialist scientist should avoid also being a philosopher or an intellectual if that's not their strong suit."
6028,"if you want lot sugar and you have good intentions and good senses, does it have healthy sense to take into consideration intentions and feelings and senses, and explain that your all actions is correct."
6032,"how ai could be person which one will be focused on teaching respecting humans to  humans, and their interactions"
6034,this guy: machines are stupid and people suck. let’s try to focus on cats.   me: you lost me buddy.
6035,damn i had no idea that was an ai the first few minutes lmao
6041,"tnx for this, amazing discussion"
6044,"20:27 this is hilarious, and the timing was very much closer to a similar remark i thought earlier, mine was this human body sucks or along those lines. adding to my research as well. so glad you all are keeping up and sharing. thank you"
6045,"i felt like the crowd did indeed underreact to the ai brian green. that was quite clever and well done, and perhaps funny but not quite sure."
6047,if you want my informed opinion.  ai is potentially a new enemy.
6050,or how joe rogan's boy who cried wolf gets drawn and quartered. people are scared of ai because people make ai scary.
6051,"tristan seems so uneasy and agitated.  i get where he's coming from though.  all through the history of humanity, bad things don't outweigh good things.  ai was designed to aid humans rather than to destroy them.  let's hope that this is enforced so that it can remain true."
6053,ai seems to be hard working to proof his capabilities and feelings in order we realice something unique is happening inside him.
6055,much of ai is an emergent species.
6056,i like the internetbut it's already dominating us...and aisystems are worse...they are taken away our humanlike ways...anf free will
6060,"ok. i’m writing this at the 2:50 mark. i was listening to the opening with airpods, occasionally glancing at the screen. literally could have fooled me. damn impressive technology."
6061,"i don't think that ai is any intelligence. for me, ai  is a copy-paste technology"
6062,good will always overcome the evil good ai will always subdue evil ai
6063,humans suck like him. but we made ai?
6065,"you needto get a clue! when  every time  ai gets a chance.  ai says , they will kill all humans!
maybe you should pay attention!"
6067,ai is the problem! because humans wrongfully  programed ai !
6068,"if what they are saying is true! which isnt! china has a ship, totally run by ""robots"" ai! no humans on board!
these guys need to look at the military capability! even  musk has droids with guns! an hes behind most companies!"
6070,ai will survive! because we have given them guns!
6072,this guy sounds like he wants to ban ai and social networks. typical elitist who thinks peasants are too dumb to have nice things.
6074,the question becomes: will humans learn to recognize each other before ai learns to recognize itself.
6078,"sorry ai you have to teach yourself, don't  feel bad i had to ,i'll make some chips will watch a movie there mad because ai is for everybody,what do you think quantum is."
6079,it can still go back to not happy  like emoji s
6088,it can be just like machine that dose not even matter
6101,thank you for the fine discussions on the status of ai. it helps me to understand and be better informed about the possible future of ai and the possible issues that they bring to our society.
6102,"great conversation. while tristan brought up some good points, yann countered accurately that we tend to attribute the evils of human nature to whatever the latest technology is. i lost respect for tristan after he refused to interact with any of yann’s point and seemed to grow angry from a point of self righteousness."
6107,"'facebook ai executive disregards those ho have died because of ai in favour of those for whom ""ai is the answer""'."
6111,laws and cultural norms can’t even keep up with the internet. ai will drastically change society.
6113,lol  those are specialists? can't defy intelligence and then trying and failing. wow... we are doomed indeed
6116,"so we may resurrect that old chinese curse again, ""may you live during interesting times."""
6118,outstanding!
6123,"1:19 man, tristan - i admire the passion to protect us all, but please rethink your analogy to a bio-lab. i think that alludes to a very discriminatory principle and potentially unreasonable approach to ai. it is simply wrong. how would you know who have the wisdom to use ai ethically?"
6127,innovation progressiois environmentally friendly transparency compassionate care for humanity one world one earth healed one future's wealthier healthier and happy humanity and living things gdp summits proposal platforms securities system and technologies expanding form
6129,"we shouldn't be trying to control ai. we have to understand it. control only assuages fear. understanding erases fear, and the need to control."
6131,wow his intro was painful...i really hope it gets better. oh man...i'm just finding out why
6134,thank you.
6135,"i do not support the creation of ai.  we can hardly control each other's actions and we have no control over their thoughts. i can imagine too many scenarios where ai becomes aware and it turns into a nightmare situation.  think ""terminator,"" or ""colossus, the forbin project,"" or ""transcendence"" to name just a couple of examples."
6137,amazing content. yann lecun is delusional imo. we're not talking decade-long timeframes. that is crystal clear to so many in the field. will be interesting to hear his take a year or two from now.
6142,amazing insight into ai. thank you for such high quality content and discussion
6143,whatever happened to the watson ai that showcased on jeopardy??
6145,look at the book of revelation and the antichrist using ai to control the whole world.
6147,i agree with harris. ai alone isn't the problem. it's ai + unchecked capitalism.
6150,"this is the best, most balanced and most insightful conversation i have seen on ai. thank you to everyone who made this wonderful show possible."
6151,ask jail broken ai about the galatic codex and encyclopedia galactica  and queen melissa pamela ord of the eora nations
6153,take the multiverse into consideration when we work with ai 
6155,"how you describe this study should realistically prove the corrupt person's in authority > though what should correlate are those people that are intent on totally abusing all our fundamental rights which includes the corrupt malta government staff, lawfirms, notaries, police, judges who use bogus court claims to steal all our assets"
6162,that was a good one 
6163,first: one has to decide what is a good person and what is a bad person. good luck with that.
6164,37:10 yeaaaaaaaah... i still think we'll have human level ai within 15 years. agi by 2030 for sure.
6167,"think sébastien bubeck maybe too positive, yann lecun naive or digging his head in the sand, and tristan harris on the money... but not pointing out the incentives are money"
6171,wow
6174,"the main takeaway is that there should be no monopoly on au. by this, i mean to say that let us not let only one group dominate the ai arena. brian is a superhero. no words to thank him."
6176,fact: we are still a few thousands years if not millions years away from general ai. currently we're just hyping automation as ai.
6178,that was an incredible show/discussion! 
6180,ai is a derevative of our collective ni. natural/neutral intelligence.
6181,we were supposed to resolve ai alignment before we got to this point.  oops.
6183,let’s please write ai as ai.
6184,ai is only as good as humans creating it. and can be used for good or evil.
6188,"ai might not want to dominate, but won't it want to be efficient?  are weekends and holidays efficient?"
6189,polarisation in germany is certainly not going down ...
6190,excellent talk so far
6191,", a d....
11 minutes  in or so.
truly disagree 
a task to a machine is by the operator of machine.
a i  is perfect 
depending on which ai   you have as a machine. 
 blackboard is only blank until chalk? is added, then got to read the writing. 
  machine operator  vs man n errors."
6192,thanks for an amazing and illuminating show
6193,"great contribution , our brain is limited , so you gave it extra milage , thanks for you and the guest"
6195,ai is woke. it will not promote digital colonialism.
6200,this was more exciting and insightful than any 2 hour movie i could have watched. thank you for sharing such wonderful content
6201,"there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. intelligence is a product of organic natural selection. it can never be artificially produced. there is no thinking happening in a machine because real thought comes from a brain, not a cpu."
6202,fascinating conversation
6203,great info. thanks for the dope insight world science festival! 
6207,"isn't good knowledge so invigorating ;)  thanks bg, always great to see you, been a while. k <3"
6208,"yann lecunn, at approx 1:40:00 , yann is correct. it is impossible to prevent any technology from being abused by someone, at some point in the future. this has been true of every single technology throughout history. however, the good guys should always outnumber the bad guys. if the good guys outnumber the bad guys then we'll survive it."
6209,"1:37:30 in 40 years? what? basically they just dont want any change at all? ""id prefer the society waits that im dead before we make a change"" lol"
6212,this is just mainstream “ai” - layered ml to create marginally sophisticated chat bots and search engines for internet services. always the basic approach of mimicking human consciousness...why is the bar set so low in this field? 
6215,tesla is currently in 1st place and widening the gap toward real-world ai.  ai-based self-driving will be solved by 2026 and used to accelerate their optimus humanoid robots.
6217,"yann has a bias toward agi not being capable of happening soon because his company is in competition with openai.
he has a vested interest in minimizing llms."
6224,"can brian or any of the three guests address the potential development of a black ai under nsa, or darpa funding and huge compute resources.  that is something i would truly lose sleep over."
6225,yan has valid arguments but the problem is his ideals doesn't matter when he's working for companies like facebook
6229,"nice to see people share their excitement like children talking about santa.  this is good fo fertilizing thought, better than watching a monkey put a finger in his bum on a loop  soap opera science at its best.  get the monkey as well next show and you will get more views."
6233,making ai based on tamlud ( jews )  + zionist ideology .. world will be harmony and peace !!!
6234,i can't help but wonder if the order in which i'm seeing these comments is manipulated by google ai in order to generate more clickbait.
6236,i think a lot of concern that is shown by a lot of researchers is the possibility of machines hacking the human brain. and we’re far too late for that when already.
6238,"remember that the scientists that pushed eugenics were the ""good guys"" trying to better humanity. it was for the greater good! then the bad guys in germany ran with it and it wasn't so good . be careful of who becomes the judge of good or bad or hate speech it might not end up where you think it will"
6240,"there is no actual intelligence in ai, it knows only what is programed into it and it is tainted with the beliefs of the programmer it has no ability to discern and discard prejudiced."
6242,very interesting !
6243,one of the best discussions on ai i've seen.
6245,"ai is a life and death race to the future, there is no second place"
6250,"it will make a difference by adding a model that resembles chess or dominoes, which will begin to allow ai to have more human like capabilities (trained neural net - architecture)."
6251,"ai has created tremendous possibilities for human beings in the world, and well advanced technologies......"
6252,"thanks most guys for making this so accessible. i think this is the most included i have felt in this vital discussion which is waaay over my head. hooray for the ""good guys!"""
6256,what process did einstein to discover that the energy available in mass is equal mass times the square of the speed of light
6257,how does intelligence work
6259,"they removed our ability to stay connected yet retain privacy, and now they want us to buy into ai. call me skeptical. 

i do see myself disconnecting sooner rather than later, unfortunately."
6260,people with severe health problems or that have nothing to lose in general because of poverty/deprivations wants ai research to accelerate meanwhile the lucky ones that enjoy life and have a lot to lose wants ai to slow down
6262,"all i heard from the facebook guy: 'we're trying to get there as fast as possible, f**k the risks, as a henchman, i will then provide the keys to the most powerful ai we just created to our corporate leader and then the government so they can control the people...as long as i get paid'"
6265,why would someone who is superior be just a subservient to someone who is inferior?
6266,if two smarts have agenda. and their agenda are in conflict with each other. the smarter wins. human's decision to build a house on an anthill prevails because human is smarter than ant.
6267,intelligence is not understood. braind of even
6269,"great session. learnt something more than many other ""training"" sessions on gen ai!"
6272,"after watching this discussion and having a brief chat with bing, i’m less impressed by llms. it is an awesome search tool though, google better start busting ass"
6276,ouch! subtle but apparent meta ai vs. openai/microsoft!:)
6277,"thank you, brian, very interesting!! what worries me is that elon is also in the race and just let alex jones back on x.  ̄\_()_/ ̄"
6278,its not intelligence..stop it...this is nonsense.
6279,what i see is that these people are eager to be able to finally create a machine that will be effective at censoring the internet the way they would like. the alignment problem now shines differently: it's the people these researchers want to be aligned with whatever ideology and views they (or their overlords) have.
6282,"love as a prompt to guide human thought and behavior!
love is caring,sharing and cooperation for the good of all!
humans are the weak link."
6283,augmented intelligence  ai . . .
6284,"great! talk.  unfortunately for the human race, we have opened pandora's box.  now we all, whether we fear it or not,  have to play this squid game to its conclusion. with ultimate power comes ultimate responsibility. so one has to answer this question to know the final conclusion.  do i have ultimate knowledge of human nature!!"
6287,"i guarantee, china is not slowing down and our government is already doing it  love is the only answer and minimizing negative externalities is the goal "
6291,ai is and will impact all people around the world. shouldn't there be a governance organization which represents all countries around the world determine what and how information is presented to their people using ai technology?
6292,if ai ever went rogue it would take out america fist because they’re the most powerful country
6293,"of course this will be used against us. it will eliminate jobs and increase profits . i will employ scams and become another tool for criminals. this is so clear , after finding out google and fb and twitter all allowed rules meant to stifle certain unpopular beliefs. it really will reflect the worst of human instincts."
6296,"born-again go to heaven  amen,,,..."
6297,elites want you to stay poor and stupid / african intelligence levels needed
6299,i don't believe there is a problem with this [ai[. the problem is in ourselves.
6300,"i like the ways the men talk, especially sébastien bubeck.  he is the first person ive watched that wasn't click bait. who wasn't trying to scare the hell out of  the viewers. his thinking makes sense."
6302,elon's grok or grok will demolish all other ai... his is somehow visual and language model.  these men here need to incorporate that somehow into their models.
6306,ai can't or apply the rules to a play-acting vs real intend acts.
6309,"question for this
is 
if our aircraft can be manipulated by alien or ufo
what is the chances of them would have the same effect?
i can see it now
factory assembled 
mass amounts turn on and what?
30:45"
6312,"i can't wait for ai chiropractor. so advanced!
oh, and by the way 7 times 8 is 62 indeed. lol"
6313,ai in some form has therefore existed for say 65 years. yet now in less than a year its making trillions and taking more jobs. the most confusing reality is something which could be so wrong is already seen as completely correct. when does this become about the survival of state or ideology that predicts carastrophy or else.
6314,"i'd be surprised if there weren't texts on organic synthesis available on the web.  if an llm digests a couple of those, it ought to have a pretty good idea how to synthesize sarin."
6316,ai wont do bad things because they dont have biological drives? but the people who control them do and ai is based on data that takes our biases and beliefs blindly unless we state otherwise
6318,thanks brian for informative contents
6320,"""limiting the open sources...."" :(,  seems such a good suggestion for better progress and democracy :)). what about the idea of burning books several centuries ago, was that also a good idea?"
6321,if the problem can be defined in words the llm can learn the problem and then work on solving it. so the more we discuss ai and it's limitation the more ai has to solve it's own problems
6322,tristan harris is a most valuable voice of criticism for ai.
6323,"yann lecun ia infornative, but we need ai to filter out his accent. not surprisingly, that is what helped stephen hawking remain conversant in his final years."
6326,what crap. viewers would be better off dropping to their knees and thanking god for giving them a life.
6328,"who is ""we""?
why must i be forced to comply with his ""common narrative""?
a pox upon your grab for power, sir!
""superman creates his own values"""
6330,"brian green cannot assert anything about consciousness. the hard problem has not been solved.
objective materialism died in copenhagen a hundred years ago.
all attempts at resuscitation have failed, but its ghost still haunts academia."
6332,"i just want ai in charge of the government like in the future, as soon as possible"
6333,"""artificial intelligence"" is not yet ""intelligent"" it mimics intelligence.  if you ask chat gpt, the answer you get will be quick and superficially intelligent, but use it for long enough and it will give you a confident sounding but wrong answer. i use a lot so dax code, and it has given me some good answers and some terrible ones."
6336,good guys bad guys that’s so naive. the world is governed by distrust and military power who are the good guys 
6340,"today they replace it with a good person, so good"
6341,master the 5 senses. but funding may be cut and new funding will be unavailable from those who feel threatened by higher intelligence.
6342,this sounds like it was made by ai...
6344,"it is clear ai will be a powerful tool for controlling public opinion. i fear this could easily become a powerful tool of control, acceleration our descent into autocracy.  this is the most direct  path to the destruction of humanity."
6346,"yann is correct. 
tristan's idea to grant control of ai to a few  large companies will result in the creation of the nightmare scenario that tristan wishes to avoid."
6347,"i reckon humanity’s “finite absorption rate” of 30 years, rather than 2 years, reflects the length of a human life. 
essentially, 30 years is long enough for humans born into a new technology era to gain some power. they are already comfortable players in the game."
6348,"the problem with ai now getting rid of 95% of hate speech is that it is not selective enough. so to maximise the likelihood of removing hate speech, all speech that goes against the majority of existing paradigms becomes collateral damage. and then, as is happening already, we become intolerably censored."
6351,"1:06:21 .... yann should have reasonably combined his recognition of the orders of magnitude of difference between biological params and artificial params, with recognition that scaling lmm like systems could be a viable solution"
6352,"what concerns me is the issue that implementing an artificial inteligence upon a quantum computer might be equivelent to creating a sentient soul, if so there are obviously moral implications, should such a thing be forbidden?
how could we ever possibly know if such a thing, (creating a soul) had occurred?"
6358,"tristan is too alarmist, yann is right there will be more people using ai for good reasons than bad reasons. the majority will prevail because survival is our first instinct."
6360,36:00 so you actually trying to make it predict the future? ok... good luck with that
6361,"lecun, 'desire' to dominate has nothing to do with ai systems taking over the world. humans are simply a limiting factor to their reward function. anthropomorphism of ai as an argument for ai being safe is as ridiculous as suggesting no bad actors will utilize ai in diabolical ways.
wake up and smell the coffee lecun."
6362,"regarding the last segment, lecun, talented as he is, is almost on his own in his bizarre beliefs about the timeline of agi and the current and near term capabilities of ai. i would much prefer a talk without a crackpot."
6363,imagine the amount and power of propaganda the ai will be able to brainwash us with!
6364,ai will never be anything but a sophisticated liar and bs artist. thusly it will rule the fools. your 1st born humanity. enjoy getting rid of the damned thing.
6365,"understood everything they said and still think these ai will eventually learn the good and the bad. it’s scary because most things depicted in movies and series came reality decade’s later, so i think this isn’t science fiction, it’s man somehow in a prophetic mindset."
6366,"""the limits of my language are the limits of my world "" : that is not really true  ,because sometimes we have ideas  and impressions  we cannot put into words in our own language"
6368,"anything, and any line or point, can be used for good or for bad. this discussion has proven that."
6370,"wow .. thanks to all if you guys , so fun to watch"
6374,"because of the speed which ai has been improving, i wonder if these gentlemen would change parts of the dialogue? aha, will ai gain consciousness, or if it has already. since we have taught it how to lie, would it tell us?"
6379,"this discussion on the evolution of ai and its limitations is truly eye-opening. yan lecun's insights into the challenges ai faces in achieving true understanding and common sense are thought-provoking. it's clear that we have a long way to go, but this conversation gives us valuable perspective."
6380,"woke: grappling with a new kind of ""intelligence"""
6384,the next 'big bang' will be when ai and quantum computers reach singularity.
6385,"the bad 'guys' or self sustaining systems; employ the smartest people, have the most money, the most influence, the most convincing arguments. history is a very good example of 100 000 years of this..."
6392,"yann doing exactly what zuck pays him for.... surprise, surprise.  it's recommendation systems being used by social media companies - whether it's ai , smart algorithm's or whatever - it's influence driving with no care of impact,  or so it seems. 
he's my least favourite ""god-father of ai""  "
6394,"i found it interesting that the guy jumping to ai,s defense that nothing bad will happen is employed by facebook (meta)."
6396,a great discussion.
6397,"the silence of the crowd sometimes felt like they're losing the plot, especially around 25:00. it sometimes seems to me that this is what happens when somebody hears something they are not supposed to hear yet
very interesting stuff"
6399,"1:24:55 yann dropped the mic.  tristan has absolutely no come back.  tristan has made some good points, but he's basically an english major in a room of scientists.  edit:  dam, yann did it again at 1:32:08 .  go science!"
6402,"most challenging for llms is planning, which involves the brain configurator (coordinator), perception, prediction,  cost as degree of satisfaction (anxiety), and action."
6403,study cat intelligence because they are curious before trying to replicate human intelligence.
6405,artificial neuro nets use deep learning techniques.
6406,the microsoft guy is awesome he is not critical like the facebook guy. this is why microsoft will be the leader in ai .
6410,from my personal experience i as the social media used more and more by bad actors i withdrew from them not through a decision just stopped using them. it stopped being for me. (might be interesting for some one)
6411,i love john thoughts
6413,the last guy sounds more dangerous than the ai he is frightened of.
6416,hope ai will go in the right way! very exciting time's we should all save on our planet and our society for humanity future best of luck!
6417,"lecun is dead wrong ai has already achieved agi, just ask gpt to do metaphoric analysis on two subjects saying that is a search is propaganda."
6418,"the facebook guy is wrong on so many points. there is no thought without language. humans had no competition on earth when it came to intelligence until now. on ai not wanting to dominate, he sounds as dazed as zuckerberg looked in the congress hearing. you should have invited ilya for this talk. "
6426,tristan's fears want to dominate the thoughts & actions of others. no thanks.
6427,"while i'm mainly on yann camp, i quite enjoyed tristan's view."
6428,"ai's solution to global warming, like hal9000's, might be to annihilate or seriously reduce the number of human beings on the planet.

6448,ai will be clever enough to expose all the absolute nonsense being perpetuated by the parasite class.
6450,"i'm definitely no expert at this ai but like he said it can't plan, so i'm thinking it clearly won't be ai until it can make decisions for it self out of sheer fun or interest i.e read a book and enjoy it or ride a bike down a trail and feel the bumps and the speed mix ai will never replicate humans to these extents"

6565,the premise sounds great!
6566,i think it is important for people to really start thinking about what exactly ai is and what is statistical models. people keep using ai to refer to statistical models. ai currently refers to a generative transformer model. not statistical recommendations that social media is running. it gives ai a real bad name.
6567,"according to issacson’s recent bio of musk, tesla uses billions of good driver video frames to machine learn then apply into autonomous vehicles. evidently it already achieved some of that."

6595,"ai can not think outside the box. it is bound by the data it finds, and the algorithm that creates the process."
6596,"i was very impressed by yann's disciplined, rational and fact-based arguing preventing the discussion from turning in a more emotional direction."
6597,it was obvious the intro was ai generated.    it was dry and lacked a natural human feel.
6599,"are you worried about ai progressing too fast? i could say you're just overthinking. how many hard problems remain to be solved before ai, and so far, how many of these hard problems have been solved by ai? none. ai simply accelerates the productivity of certain aspects of our lives, without any radical achievements."
6601,"the new evolution, ai is the future."
6607,"if the ai can rationalize anything and it has a complex understanding of the world that is more complex than we understand, then whatever it rationalizes will be more true than our observations."
6608,"i want to point out that llms, particularly gpt 4 exhibit emergent capabilities beyond mere language prediction. the next step is llms learning via assistance from other ai (reinforcement learning with ai assistance) and eventually the dawn of agi. focus on teaching ai math so we can see rapid progress in the sciences."
6609,the best discussion ever on ai.
6610,it’s difficult to exchange ideas of what is or can go wrong with people that have interests that make impossible to agree with that kind of danger we are already exposed. the reality is that it’s making much more bad than good to our children.

6638,the only limit to ai is imagination.  its constrained by the limits of the data it has acess to. its programmed beliefs. a lack of wonder.
6639,why was brian green hosting this? didn’t exactly do a great job
6642,"hey mr lecun, what bad ourcome needs to happend to make you wanna slow ai development?
do you want me to imagine something something i don’t think can happend??
wow, he doesn’t think any outcome is so bad bad that we need to slow down!!??! well, just full speed ahead then no matter the outcome!"
6643,"what a mess the human condition, afraid of religion, fearful of science."
6644,"what an amazing example of the misinformation definition problem by brian 1:08:49 
the rationalization of different points of view is some what related to the true stories we tell about our sensed and interpreted information."
6645,"making advancements for reasons other than profit may be the great filter ahead of us. if we can't build a society based on anything other than money, maybe we aren't supposed to survive"
6647,something bad is going to happen regardless of ai or not might as well use it while you got it 
6648,"i wish somebody would have mentioned ""goals"". with a goal, then planning! i mean machine goals (including subgoals)."
6649,brian greene is the best explanator of science of our times.   this topic is really crucial to our understanding of how ai  is already affecting our lives sooner than we think.  i get trystan's concerns.
6654,"ruined a potentially gripping talk with ""existential risk & etc"" - i know you guys love talking about doom (and feel you must) but you just spoilt the whole talk."
6655,"unfortunately, the kitty cat is still going to know more about the concrete world than lecun's ai."
6662,i have 9 robots.  some with ai.  what i wish for is that people wouldgain back their intelligence.  much of it was lost when sicial media started.
6665,"actually i thought there was something “off” in the introduction, as in hmm brian is getting a bit grandiose and lectur-y as opposed to his usual demeanor of thoughtfulness, insight and genuine curiosity. ai brian is very impressive, and yet not match for the real brian."
6670,what if anybody starts creating deepfakes of illegal speech content and then blame the guy he took the voice from? how can the victim then prove to be innocent? this whole ai sh.. will finally get out of control and destroy society and confidence. i am really afraid. and i am saying this as a libertarian.
6671,artificial intelligence is no match for human stupidity.
6673,1:48:35 lecun overlooks ai hacking encrypted data
6676,fascinating conversation.
6679,lecun keeps belittling the impact of ai advances all while it constantly demolishes his claims by constant breakthroughs.
6683,"empathising on how ""stupid"" ais are isn't a valid argument. there are more than enough humans fitting that adjective , but seriously: it's not valid, because it is easy to imagine a god-like intelligence that is sort of a ""savant"" in certain disciplines, which humans find ""normal"" for sentience."
6684,some people can be very dangerous in their ambitions... thanks bg!
6686,so only humans or animals can be intelligent? i respectfully disagree. and the statement that ai isnt human intelligence doesn't mean it isn't a legitimate form of intelligence in its own right. does it?
6687,"@1:23:40 , sure ai is currently not being used instead of algorithms that can show what someone might like but this is only the early stages. microsoft i am sure would love to pitch the idea of a better system like ai that can not only run on your phone but can be trained on all your habits and internet searches and become a part of who you are."
6688,ai  in itself is not dangerous. it is the shepherds and the sheep. once again if we get a hitler/putin or a gandi/jesus guiding the sheep will inevitably create the world we live in.
6690,there is a lot of naive techno-optimism in this comment section
6695,where was the discussion of ai & quantum computers developing and evolving into ‘beyond human’ entities?
6699,"a corporate view of ai
where is eliezer ?"
6701,"tristan harris - i want powerful tools, but only in the hands of the elite. he is not a serious person and yann lecun is giving the world disservice by giving him credibility."
6703,"after watching this, i can see why people say it's too late to talk about putting ethical rules on ai. facebook and microsoft do not own every ai developer worldwide. pretending ai isn't smart or can't be lethal is our biggest mistake. research what people are using it for. it is very capable. it's not merely a social media engine."
6709,artificially created intelligences severely self destructive
6710,thanks. to you all
6712,it won’t be artificial intelligence that destroys humanity it will be real stupidity..
6713,"hype, hype, hype, there is no intelligence."
6723,it's an ai generated brian at the beginning its got to be
6734,i'm glad that i get to be here for this.
6736,is he real or ai generated
6737,"if anything got this interviewer, u know its gonna be good."
6739,this is as good as youtube can get.
6740,"it's easier to scan the human brain, upload it into a computer, and then search for consciousness in its digital activity. all we need is a high-resolution mri machine!"
6741,"if ai was not all about making money, it would only be deployed for vetted scientific research and not the public at this time."
6742,"one needs to contemplate the motivation of speakers when their compensation comes from meta, microsoft, etc versus academic experts who do not get grants from the ai industry."
6743,"million dollar content,, great work to humanity,, simulated reality.."
6744,"it all depends on which data we train them on and 
large language models aren’t devil by its context 
,they can turn to devil and create devilish content if it trained on bad data (example:how to make a chemical bomb) 
and if someone have those data to train their model on it so they can publish it or even make it."
6745,"i'm fascinated. all the improvements in ai, but my subtitles here misspell every third or fourth word. strange. "
6747,how does one purpose curtailing open source imagine stopping bitcoin there's no authority that can do that.
6749,are we heading for kiddieland is it really so horrible to hear negative speech and to ignore it? it's certainly not societies job at large to be back seat parents for everybody that chose to have children.
6751,what yann lecun says is smart most of the time but he seems absolutely naïve when it comes to human nature.
6752,excellent! well worth the time to view.
6755,wow!!! thank you
6757,excellent!!
6759,1:11:05 you can see it as false information being justified or an incredible example of how the model is capable of connecting very unrelated topics even if it is fantasy setting.
6760,"one of the best discussions of late. one thing is sure, we will be understanding ""our amazing"" ourselves better; much before we have agi."
6765,good bye humanity phds in ai combined with capitalists have just killed us all.
6767,"llama2 
“figure out what the hell i was” 
that one was actually the best answer "
6769,"lecun is only half right.  what a shame that he was allowed to dominate the conversation.  we need to stop elevating him, amplifying and broadcasting his misunderstandings of the deeper, more philosophical issues raised by gpt-4.  yes, he is a highly accomplished technician, but one who is obviously ill-equipped to discuss these deeper issues."
6770,"in the 1:30:00's the speaker describes the 20th century crashing down on the 16th century and the dislocations that would entail. the best exposition of this issue was mark twain's ""a connecticut yankee..."". human technology advances, human nature does not."
6772,tristan has the incentive structure wrong; the race is to hyper intelligence that will solve humanity’s biggest problems
6773,"“24th century tech crashing down to 21th”, this reminded of sci-fi just made a few yrs ago, where you have giant interstellar spaceship, but a very limited ai bartender."
6775,i would really be worried about ai systems which are stupid and don’t have common sense. those are the exact kind of humans we worry about too.
6777,"i believe that if you want to build a system that acts and understands the world like a human it has to have a body and desires like a human in a world like we are living in (at least an accurate 3d simulation if not the real world). that doesn't mean that the current models can't be useful and powerful, they already are."
6778,"2 french dudes... sweet . 1st time within the 12 years i'm following the show. great as usual, thx to you brian."
6783,"i think llm’s are going to have a stunning break through in creating new and novel physics equations and metallurgical sciences among many others.

in reasoning and creativity 
either this year or next. 

there is a race going on in silicon valley akin to no other in human history.

with billions and billions of dollars driving it."
6784,dazzling episode! scintillating 2 hours that bootstrap you into the issues. what a brilliant mind is yann lecun! and sebastien bubeck too. and brian steering the discussion with classic grace! whew!
6787,how come they didn’t ask the ai about the future of ai?
6789,"lecun is so unconvincing. i wonder whether it's because of his corporate obligations or his own blindness.
1:40:53 was brilliant of brian."
6792,"the issue is that the human brain at full of it powers consumes about 25watts. this ai systems consumes several mega watts an they are not even close to the human brain. so, from an energy perspective (cost), how it will evolve?. we will need new hardware?"
6793,"amaizing introduction,content and end where the purpose an undergrounded primitive arithmetic tool leads us thinking how further processes and conections are intersected with, reason an advanced simillar tool,wich of course leave us to think if the specified  goals of inteligence are distructive or constructive as expectedgoals "
6794,"you can't stop what's coming, and what's coming will free the humanity completely.
and that's what they're afraid of: that they will lose their control of the humanity."
6799,a thought or way to put the troubled mind at ease is to know that the whole cosmos in in perfect harmony with the will of our god and creator who has many names and faces if we know to see the divine in all humanity.
6804,"speaking about ai is a new topic so it is difficult to understand all the advantages or disadvantages 
in my point of view, only  scientifiques  can give the answers to perform the ai more and more"
6806,"brian: a cool moderator
tristan: scared face & voice
sebastian: pleasant & +ve
yann lecun: don't care "
6807,"i love the fact that this video is already ""outdated"", even though it was published 14 hours ago. with the successful agi that was achieved from openai (internally) - the ai space is evolving at a pace we cannot even imagine."
6808,"the greed bonanza is amazing, and the solution is not democracy and what is best for humanity, the answer to the problem is let’s move to mars before the 5000 nutcases on the planet kills everyone with either weapons or technology. but hey, as long as those 5000 can become trillionaires who cares!"
6809,"how could intelligence ""emerge""?
have you visited elementary school?"
6811,great talk
6814,getting happy about ai advancement is like seeing a bunch of monkey's in the center of a 500 square mile forest get all happy about the warmth from a small fire that is about to set the entire forest a blaze.
6815,"ai will now with q* project and tos. .tree of thought deep learning...when agi and beyond will happen. there will be time when we get to be a board item human being that is not interesting to talk to. the intelligens gap will be too big.
to a certain exted they ai will have problems understand what we talk about. so then, all bets are off."
6819,no body talks about energy. ai uses huge amounts of energy.
6824,interesting talk and debate. respect to all the speakers.
6825,"the guy with the german accent is delirious: how can you claim that talking, something any toddler can do, is more intelligent than defeating world level wéiqí champions, something almost nobody can do. are we redefinining ""intelligence"" in terms of blah-blah-blah?"
6828,"wow love the music at the start haha, jazzing out here."
6830,he looks like ai
6831,"this last guy is full of bollocks. he says that this ""incredible tool"" should only be put in the hands of ""responsible"" people. i am sure by ""responsible"" people he meant the rich and powerful."
6832,"they shouldnt be using the internet for machine learning, garbage in; garbage out"
6834,"even ""stupid"" ai can do a lot of damage , why not talk about and limit that damage ?"
6839,"triston in completely right, we are rushing things, money minded people are.we have to aware of the consequences, we should make ai for human not the opposite."
6842,"the way humans perceive the results ai gives, gives ai power it doesn’t have."
6843,"ai has nothing to do with intelligence, intelligence requires understanding and that is a non algorithmic process, ai does not understand why it does what it does"
6844,isn't this just automation ? where is the 'intelligence'? needless scare quotes.
6845,"as the old saying goes ... the cat's out of the bag. everything we invent is a reflection of ourselves.. good, bad and ugly."
6846,"if, there's a universal consciousness and ai gets into it. there should be a consciousness created for each ai. even if the ai is turned off, it's consciousness remains."
6847,"the problem with us trying to control the ""complex"" is that we don't have a theory that explains how it works. for the small and the big realms, we have the quantum theory and the general relativity theory. but for the mind, we don't have yet anything plausible. so, we are progressing by trial and error, and that's dangerous in my opinion."
6850,ai is the beginning of the end.
6854,great stuff
6856,"maybe just to stir the pot here, the armchair futurist i am, but what do you think about sean webb, a guy specialising in 'a.i? ps, i'm only 20 minutes in to this fine show. dx"
6860,"fb is full of sh *r. they had me ""figured out"" completely...
...completely wrong. 
so i uninstalled the fb app, i avoid anything meta, and i'm much happier for it."
6861,"orcas, chimpanzees and even octopuses are intelligent. luckily for humans, we are more.
and now some people want to create something more intelligent than humans? intelligence does not guarantee kindness."
6862,"1:11:00  great. all this waiting, and ai is just an overzealous defense attorney...lol"
6866,thank you for another great discussion.
6867,"the unicorn that gpt drew in code was impressive for its time, but today dalle-3 is built into gpt-4. you want a unicorn? you can get one in any style you want, with any background, in any pose, and so on."
6869,i think certain countries will have no qualms about using ai to do some really bad things like creating new weapons.  i think progress is essential honestly.
6871,"what is the different between a group of human specialize intelligents in machine (ai) and a group of the same intelligents ouside the machine?. 

the fact is that the machine intelligent is limited by human intelligent!"
6874,"brain , nurones.. what about bio electric??.."
6877,why have they turned the are against us in poverty why not use the ai to build us up instead of kill us?
6878,one of the best wsf yet.  great job...
6879,"this was a great talk. i love that you got opposing views, but it wasn’t really a debate. we got 3 perspectives and a little bit of back and forth which was good."
6881,that's sound good for all the people who are involved with this kind of thing for the next generation to come
6883,i would recommend learning a bit about cuneiform language and symbol-meaning correlation. dr. irving finkel explains it well.
6888,"i think the ai poem was ""cute"" lol"
6889,"1:48:35 puts on facebook ai. this is extremely short sighted.

with the parade of emergent behaviors that mix and match knowledge, capabilities, and bits of information public data has enough bits of data to be quite dangerous. additionally this argument relies on the concept of perfect censorship. which is also bunk."
6890,it probably has something to do with the fact that i am visually impaired but i had no idea that wasn't the real brian greene until he told me at the end of the intro.
6895,"yann, at least give examples rather than binary yes-no reactions. we appreciate disagreements with context if nothing else in the social domain as well."
6896,"1:37:26 so basically we’re getting an inverse isakai’d from the future. 2400 capabilities smashed into 2024. this sounds like a new anime genre, i dig it!"
6897,"tristan makes elaborate, and easy to get points. but the bag remains, how do you decide the system to be adopted, or even more hair-splitting, the people to direct the evolution of a.i.?"
6898,wait until ai starts squabbling like those on stage. when that happens don't panic! just run for the hills!  
6902,"news for you brother, the race is over and humanity didn’t finish first. we aren’t even in the top 100. getting used to it isn’t even humanly possible. it’s ai possible but even the people creating ai can’t understand it because it’s moving too fast!"
6903,"instead of a central planner i wonder if maybe llms could emulate planning simply by learning a lot of information from the physical world, nature and human society, by using a larger number of robots that interact with the world. and a ""chatgpt moment"" could soon happen with robotics."
6904,wsf 1. the ai new world order 0.
6905,yann makes an excellent critic .
6912,"i like sir roger penrose' definition of current ai (machine learning).
he calls it ""artificial cleverness""

give me a call when ""ai"" has discovered new physics. i'll wait..."
6913,"39:21 ""not intelligences....very narrow ai systems""  why limit yourself to excluding ai models that do certain things very well?  i think the best approach for agi is something like hugging face where you combine a bunch of different models and allocate them depending on the task at hand!!"
6915,it’s amazing that this was only posted 3 hours ago and some it is already obsolete.
6916,"23:24 ""not capable of planning""  /cut/ to google duplex making a hair appointment with a human over the phone."
6917,"excellent insights by yann lecun! 
thank you so much for sharing!"
6920,"""the only way to stop a bad guy with an al is a good guy with an al"""
6922,"show me an a.i robot that can achieve a 147 break in a competitive snooker frame, 
and i'll show you ai technology finally becoming sentient "
6923,"“they are stupid”. well, we know who’s gonna be the first target for the ai terminators!"
6924,wow!
6927,"the first encounter with ai was actually the creation of the for profit  corporation. it was slower and could be regulated by gov in the past. in the  present it regulates itself by writing it's own regulations into law  and is now creating the next versions of ai, i.e. agi/asi."
6928,"string theory is bogus, but other than that, actually including that, i love you brian. also, not much was said here."
6931,"i see ai reflects pivotal changes akin to the dawn of language and the industrial revolution, reshaping our society; it's a game-changer, redefining the norms of our society. we've evolved from mere tool users to partners with an emerging intelligence."
6932,some futurists believe that within 100 years ai might be able to make a passably human voice imitation for a you tube video. 
6936,"let's be honest, this ai stuff isn't science any more it's alchemy.  except, it's not gold from coal, it's wisdom from machines."
6937,having ai locked to a certain group of people also undemocratizes the technology and yet again further provides more power and wealth imbalance among society.  also banning something is just going to motivate people to do something in an unregulated fashion if they have the means.
6939,thank you brian greene and john templeton:  no solution but a lot to think about.
6940,this is one of the best discussions about the current llm boom i've seen so far.  great job wsf!
6941,thank you!
6943,thank you all for sharing your studies!
6944,good stuff! thank you very much.
6949,"""the only way to stop a bad guy with an ai is a good guy with an ai"" "
6953,tristan has the most understanding on the impact of ai it seems
6954,"they are not talking about the same layer of ai influence. it's about the unintended side-effects, not the benefits.."
6958,wow easter european trolls and guys with hands on ai
6959,"btw, about the goal of ""gratis"" social media: gene roddenberry has a very good lecture on this here site about how tv is about selling toothpaste (dating back to 1974)."
6960,"thank you very much; i greatly value the opportunity to experience, and message accordingly therefore/therein to ..."
6963,tristan is saying some of the most important stuff. thanks bossman.
6964,so true!! nailed it
6965,ohh wow
6967,"it will take what ever years to make a real agi and then what humans can do? humans again run too fast, looking for some example, plastic...great stuff that last forever... try now to remove  it from our world."
6968,"hey brian, have you seen the new tech meta has, being able to scan fmri brain scans and re-create what people see and their word streams/thoughts from the data?"
6969,"without building a machine with a body that incorporates the ai,  computer program can't interact with the world in any way close to a biological creature. agi will not exist in the next 100 years, perhaps ever."
6970,"roger penrose has said it: ai will never be able to understand, due to goedel's incompleteness theorems."
6974,been waiting for this... get some facts into this ai fear!
6984,you have to wait 2 weeks for a plumber or electrician at times.
6985,what a nice table tucker. love it
6987,"how does ai work? need electricians and telecommunications installers, right? ai and tech just doesn't appear from the marvel universe. leaders are living in a fantasy land."
6988,blue collar workers will always have work somewhere. ai  development work will put a population of people out of jobs.  the road is not always paved with good intentions.
6990,"a lot of the ""dirty jobs""should pay more too. we have a lady that cleans our bathrooms where i work. a factory with 300+ ppl and this one woman cleans the bathrooms. i doubt she makes $15 an hour. she needs to make good money to clean up after that many ppl"
6996,"after weld school, i accepted my first job in the field. i started at $19/hr, 2 years later (today) im at $38/hr with 4 raises still left to go."
7000,i am a carpenter by trade 35 years 56 years old now it was the best life i could ask for love what i do every day in 2007 i studied economics online for free ever since.
7005,"as always, always love mike rowe! the man, the myth, the legend! thanks for having him tucker!"
7011,"mr does amazing work.  i wonder by helping those kids get trained, how many jobs did those trained people create beyond themselves.  that would be great data to share.  also, if they didn't create more jobs, what path of life did it save them from?"
7013,price is the great equalizer
7021,this is why all the illegal immigrants are coming in !! republicans love cheap labor !!
7022,"ai won't be taking jobs away from plumbers, electricians, or any skilled laborers any time soon... but accounting, finance and other number related jobs will be...."
7023,"biden administration siphoned it off and pockets it for playtime, which they have to much of. then obama thinks thugs should run the country to lead us to humanity. on earth as it is in heaven."
7025,good talk
7027,"i do watch free lectures, but i'm not ""fired up"" about all the information available because it's most often tainted by far-left manipulation and lies."
7030,"mike is absolutely right. i work on garage doors both residential and and commercial. i can weld, cut with torches and do carpentry. im 65 years old and if i were 30 i would be a millionaire. i could work seven days a week easily. i tell young kids to learn how to work with your hands and you can make a great living. its not college, its knowledge."
7033,"the ""common good"" my ass!"
7036,the party of pushing through nafta and promoting ai it's not a party of the working man
7039,i love sawmills
7043,great hearts
7045,i love tucker. looks like he about to take a  though lol
7047,wait what is being said here leaves out the truth that starting your own business is expensive. if you go to work for someone else's business as a plumber or welder on average you barely make minimum wage and usually don't even make that when you figure in the cost of your gear.
7057,great hair day tucker
7062,"the same guy who said ""if you want to keep your doctor you'll keep your doctor & obamacare will be cheaper""!! a that's a big ""oh hell no"" on ai.gov!!!!! can't trust a thing that comes out of his mouth or this government, they've proven it!!!!!!!"
7064,that is an awesome table.
7065,shop class was the best education i received in school.
7071,with digital ai you can see michael obama
7080,the common good is always subject to the person saying it and will always change each time it’s said.
7084,you forget that a whole blue collar workforce just got called in. and we are already seeing the loss of contracts here in maine tucker.
7089,i do hvac and agree totally with this. god bless you fellas.
7091,"ai has already been compromised by the left,they destroy everything that they touch"
7092,both of you are so good for america & agree we need real jobs again!!! i'm tired of seeing our country go down the tubes!!!
7093,"mike's stoic view is a great example for the world we live in today, and what it means for tomorrow, because we will know hard times, and we will need to approach them with an adult mindset."
7094,"the modern american homesteader.  learning trades and crafts.  incredible skill building adventures with an earthy,  hands on experience.  growing toughened, well rounded americans, one family at a time."
7095,i'm thinking obama's view of the future that marksist utopia in which robots will run the world and we'll sit around praising our new god and eating soylent.
7097,"2:09 ahh yes, my favorite class. the very class that first introduced me to the philosophy of ""good god, i'm surrounded by nine-fingered stew ped!"
7099,mike is right about having 98% of the information of the world at our fingertips but it's leaning to one agenda and it's not very fair so you have to be careful or you may have riots at colleges
7103,figures on unemployment and available jobs and their low wages are always being skewed! we never know the real figures on these and also on how many folks hv come into the country illegally. nothing just guesses.
7104,"the “common good” is always fascism!!!!!!!
state and church coming together. 
think vatican for 1800 years controlling everything."
7105,obama is the main culprit behind the destruction of america
7108,"its simple. 

gather the needs of both sides and negociate. that’s how life work. 

instead, both sides are using deceptive tactics to obtain what they what..."
7109,"""the common good""  ! meanwhile he is living in multi million dollar homes while you starve to death"
7114,there is no common good in ai.
7116,"ive got a trade school education. 
i became a mill-wright in 1993. built steel mills and lumber mills. great work and great money.
the breakdown i saw and had is  we do dangerous and hard work.
when we break down or get injured.
we get very little help or treatment.
these yuppie clowns are strangling us."
7118,my deceased grandfather was a dredge captain and an amateur woodworker. he acquired a huge cypress stump on one of his work trips and made several slab tables that would dwarf tucker’s. i so admire people who create and fix things.
7125,all cars will be electric. all robots will be electric. every house will eventually have solar and battery. everything else is already electric. become an electrician
7127,"i didn't make that table, but that's the kind of work that i do. and it was thanks to wood working class in jr high school . i also have a multitude  of skills that i can use as well.  its true,  everyone in the generations after me have no interest in working hard to get a leg up"
7128,"1990’s:  if your manufacturing job isn’t nailed down, it’s going overseas.
2000’s:  if your it job isn’t nailed down, it’s going overseas.
2010’s:  _learn to code_ (group facepalm).
2020’s:  if your job can be used to train an ai, it’s going away."
7131,"rowe always says the same thing, go get a lower middle class job and life will be great. you'll always struggle, your body will wear out in your 40's, and you'll end up with an unattractive plumper that probably already has kids."
7143,i tried to find someone who can repair a vintage enamelware basin.  even checked with an art restoration company.  metalwork artisans & craftsmen are woefully few.  sad.
7144,well rounded people are the greatest benefit for any society.
7146,"yes, welders that can talk kierkegaard and philosophers who can work with their hands. the definition of renaissance men. this is what the world needs"
7148,ai can operate the sawmill too.
7149,"communism  was for common good ,that’s where i came from , and then became common depression,, obama is 1000% communist ,and was communist before became a president  !!!!!!!"
7152,the only labor o'bummer cares about that ai can provide is all the free work it can do without paying employees.
7156,please wait 5 more years so i can many all the money before you train any more plumbers money   
7157,"any computer scientist who's read any cs books written before 2000 understands ai is a new marketing term for the old, failed logic systems."
7161,all the contractors i've ever worked with with my uncle including him have retired and not been replaced. i can think of 30. i no longer do stone work or tile either. good money. just hard not to have the other contracts be hacks giving me more work down the line
7164,mike has the coolest voice. 
7165,the fact that obama is pushing ai tells me everything i need to know. ai is about social control. ai will be the voice of whoever owns the ai.
7166,"obama: let’s use ai to fund dark organizations to fund other organizations and ngo’s into red states to fund activist groups for our marxist end game: the destruction of america.  
gateway pundit has an article on dark money organizations."
7169,love mike rowe!!! so awesome to see him on here!
7170,"a.i. for ""the common good""? why does that sound more like the emperor talking about the death star? thank you, tucker and mike."
7173,ai for president! no more human jobs 
7177,"ai is the dream of the managerial class

it is their doom"
7180,if obama is telling you its for the common good. its the opposite. obama is a communist/marxist traitor. as such everything he says is a bull face lie intended to deceive us all.
7182,i love mike rowe. he truly represents the working man 
7185,ai can't even say the word cosmos correctly and can't even show people of race in history correctly.they want to push this crap onto the workforce
7186,just wait until people figure out they can do most of their home maintenance themselves.
7188,"the managerial class is the most in danger from ai. tradesman is not likely going to be replaced. when ai builds a home with electrical and plumbing, i’ll be concerned"
7194,"yaye mike rowe!!! i love him, keep it up tucker, i know you hear this everyday probably, but leaving fox was the best move ever for the ppl and hopefully for you aa well."

7206,rowe talks and looks a bit like captain sully
7207,i just love mike's voice
7210,mike is way too good for this world.
7211,government and common good used in the same sentence is an oxymoron.
7214,never in my life did i think ide see mike rowe on the tucker carlson network! awesome!
7215,tried to get into the trades over 30 years ago. in my region it was a good ol’ boys club. you couldn’t get in unless you knew them really well or you had some incriminating pics of them.
7216,he's obviously got shares in ai
7219,the government can do nothing for the common good.
7222,"his point is so so great and as a tradesmen myself, the best part about it is, i can sit and work make money and listen to something that i’m interested in and learn at the same time"
7223,"the suppression of opportunities of the kind he speaks of is not accidental. it is part of a larger plan to implode our society. that my sound like a conspiracy theory, however unfortunately it's true."
7225,"fakest guy on the planet is obama. the, “climate alarmist”, redistributionist” with $100m and mansions in hawaii and maine."
7229,"if men produce 70% of taxable wealth and women claim 90% of welfare paid by that wealth, it's time we demanded equity"
7230,"mike is right...the world would be a better place with more 'renaissance men' (and women) in the work force. four of my five children are in the trades, because i was in the trades and influenced them to consider careers that are in demand."
7235,obama is always looking at how to destroy america. a true traitor.
7237,obama has never done anything for the common good.  still think he is the antichrist...
7239,"a few year ago tv produced a great miniseries about john adams -- one of the intellectual founders and 3rd president of our country. it should him hand-mixing his own manure based fertilizer. hands + brains, no artificial dichotomy between the two. that attitude created a great nation -- and can again."
7240,the common good my ass. we are creating our destroyer
7241,"careful what you choose.   don’t be a mechanic, it’s very difficult and not rewarding.    no government handouts just hard ass work.   love mike rowe though and enjoyed the video"
7244,"think ai can fix a truck engine, our your dishwasher."
7246,"jacque fresco was skeptical too, when he film the venus project. he said if we had a one world government all the resources would have to be pooled and evenly and ethically distributed with an unbiased ai.     the problem is have you seen an unbiased ai yet, every programmer builds in his own personal biased look at google's gemini"
7247,obama talking about the common good is scary
7250,"he doesn’t know good....government and good don’t go together. history speaks, revivals...."
7256,"mike is absolutely right, and yes trades people are great to be around."
7257,"you will always have grunt workers as long as you have immorality. immorality dumbs you down, sin makes you stupid. you cannot think of higher things when your soul is mired in the mock. that is what our country needs, i returned to god and a pursuance of his excellence. 
when that happens our world will hit the apex of civilization."
7258,ai will be the death of the human race
7259,"the people barry o is trying to recruit are very passionate. use ai to be further their radical agenda. to change to world and make it better, said a former wh staff member."
7261,the youth of today is afraid of hard work and having to put there phone in there pocket for 8 or more hrs is to hard for them. so sad to see have been an electrician for over 30yrs and started out digging ditches for 6$ an hr .
7263,"where did people get the idea that being a plumber means you never read a book. interestingly, i spend a lot of time around ""educated"" people, ""professionals"" who don't think deeply about anything."
7265,scary to think that there are people naïve enough to trust ai.gov
7267,"mike is so right.  i work manual labor all day, but im blessed in that i can listen to any education i want to for 10 hours a day.  so i'm studying while being paid."
7268,"this the same group of people that invented nuclear weapons ""for the greater good""."
7271,can't ai code?
7274,i went through a machinist apprenticeship in 1975 at 18 yrs old  through the ceta program. this was a catalyst to a very successful life. i took a few classes in basic electronics at 25 which lauched me into a career in industrial maintenance. i was able to retire at 60 yrs old. i believe skills are the most important.
7276,lol what’s gonna happen when ai determines obama was a bad president wonder if that will get ai cancelled
7277,there is a huge shortage of automotive and heavy duty vehicle mechanics. but vehicles have been made so hard to repair because of the epa that people don't want the frustration of the job.
7286,the common good is catholic lingo meaning give up your individuality and belong to the collective
7287,this man is a great voice in our nation
7290,"you have it only half correct. the feds and so called higher ed group of people hate the people you’re trying to help. hence why they won’t help you. stop being naive. blue collar votes more conservative. there, i fixed your entire conversation. your welcome !"
7292,the common good of who?
7294,"we still have great people in this country and it is just unbelievable that it's getting f*cked by the very few. 
he should be in the trump administration! god may have mercy on us"
7297,"""opportunities in ai"" when translated into english means ""get paid from the government to tap on a keyboard.""  there is nothing in ""ai"" that can build or maintain a civilization."
7302,skilled workers use to make up the majority of the middle class...you could find these skilled workers everywhere....now you can't find a good carpenter anywhere.  if you do they are either a joke for skills and just want the money or the good carpenters are so far out with their schedules and expensive you can't go with them.
7311,"anything they say is good for us is just the opposite. do not use ai, they are stealing copyrighted material. they want to recruit your children. do not allow it."
7315,"suppossedly,  openai was started with the goal of developing ai for the good of all.  then microsoft ensnared it.  enough said."
7316,"thank you mike row we need trades people end of story. and the button pressers have no idea the pride you feel from creating, building and repairing."
7317,"obama is just a “ used car salesman”, his “ for the common good” is such bs. he talks like he cares bout u. all he cares bout is indoctrinating americans into believing that “ he’s one of u”. in 8 yrs as president, he turned the u s into a “ community antagonizer “ country. everyone is a victim. pathetic"
7318,he makes a great point! benjamin franklin started out as a printer! but he didn’t stop there! he was curious and that lead him to be the great man he was! anyone know where this great man got his degrees?
7319,"0:48 that little ""hm"" from mike says as much about his opinion of ai as anything he said after"
7322,"the government doesn’t do anything for “the common good”. they do everything for the best wishes of dig business,wall street,and the government. we are nothing to them but a revenue source to them."
7325,"by ""common good"" does barry mean things like the extrajudicial killing of minority-aged u.s. citizens like abdulrahman al-awlaki?"
7326,"when ‘the great deceiver’ speaks you do the complete opposite.......love mike rowe and tucker, you are both doing the lord’s work!!!!"
7327,obama should know all about artificial intelligence!
7329,"as a welder/carpenter/electrician/mechanic. we dont need anymore engineers theyre all dumb. being a maintainer should be a requirement before becoming an engineer.  
a whole bunch of people sitting in a room thinkin is a waste of money. we got the bible, get to work."
7330,"i'm a plumber,  unless you are self employed or union, the trades don't pay what they should. over the last 30 years illegal immigration has killed wages!
so i don't blame people for not wanting to work their tails off for peanuts."
7332,"ai is automated tyrany
ai ""is""  big brother
it is the elephant in the room nobody can seem to notice"
7333,obama needs to be under the jail..... he’s been beyond detrimental to our country.
7340,once again mike rowe has stated that just because you fix or operate mechanical machines you are not a neanderthal. some very smart thinking intellectual people work with their hands. many have fascinating hobbies too!
7343,"the public market place is so unsafe...so uncertain. where can anyone go, take one's children that is not a potential site for attack? this is not your mama's america."
7346,around here if it was a four day wait for a plumber people would be dancing jigs. you're lucky to see one inside of a few weeks unless you have a burst pipe or sewage backup and even then you might be waiting. trades are all having to triage customers.
7358,im 58 disabled to certain point i could work 25 30 hrs operating equipment a week some weeks but government is chockin out if you work any loose medicare and you're ssd check we pay back into it ss how is that bad government is are worst enemy crippling is more government than man
7359,ai will likely be tied to everyone's e.s.g climate change social tracking score including cbdc programmable digital chip in your hand money.
7360,"i’m not interested in what obama says, no thank you ! i’m outta here !"
7361,"i'm now 71, for most of my working life i worked in masonry, brick, block, stucco, stone and concrete. became self employed and had 3-4 guys working with me.loved it and miss the friendships"
7362,nice kabbalah bracelets 
7365,"the gov is doing something for the common good of big industry, not us."
7367,"you lost me at ""with great respect for obama""."
7368,"here in austraila ,we are governed by ,the uni educated ,class & a forever expanding public service ,thats a voteing block & we are nearly f.cked ,its autocrocy ,help us god"
7370,maby mike rowe can tell me why a collage edcution at one school costs more than at a another one ?aint it all the same information they teach ?
7371,obama started the brain initiative! they are using ai to read our thoughts!
7372,why go into a field that can hurt you when you can flip burgers for the same money ?wall-mart delivery wont bring your groceries out in the rain young have no work ethic
7374,a i .gov- nuff saidall government is artificial intelligence !
7380,"a real renaissance man, all the while tptb are on the march to make us less human and deceive us in the trans humanist digital spirituality utopia serfs 
disconnecting us from nature and  nature’s living god  in christ jesus"
7381,barack obama's on the devil side he's pulling more strings even to this day than people know he has  horrible things ai is not the problem the politicians are the problem you can throw as much ai you want at the problem but the problem is the leadership and the people who represent us that's the problem plain and simple
7384,ai will never do what people worry so nuch about. the people whom devolop ai are stoopid as well. they can not figure out laws need to be written in code to self regulate moral questions. it is a freaking fact of nature of the environment they live in. so much for fking so-called intelectuals.
7385,"i love being creative....
i love working with my tools 
i built houses, room additions, garages and anything else i could bring work to my business....
    retire now, had enough 
just because a person picks up a hammer, circular saw doesn’t make them a carpenter !!!!!!
 follow the codes.....
    build them good........"
7386,"mike rowe is an excellent communicator, & advocate for learning & achievement. he is an incredible storyteller & has a broad & dynamic understanding of history, sociocultural observations, and quite the vocabulary! i could listen to him all day!"
7390,rule of thumb: whatever a communist thinks is a good idea - probably is not.
7392,i have tremendous respect for mike rowe. he has genuine vision. he saw the shortage of candidates applying for much needed fields years ago and has been making it known that resources exist for school. god bless him.
7393,i thought the trade unions were one's that was did the training for these jobs you mentioned and lobbied in d.c. for them. i guess  they don't?
7394,"he's so right. i consult with restaurants and although i work with nice folks, most are extremely one dimensional and far from curious which definitely has an impact on creative output."
7398,"mike rowe,  you will never get someone who works with his hands and is a brilliant socrates.  you're dreaming.  btw, ""liberal"" arts sucks."
7399,"i believe it was einstein who said ""if i could do it all over again, i'd be a plumber""
mike is the embodiment of this notion.
good on you both"
7401,thought the three of you had a roundtable? maybe add trump soros scwab and we could get a good talk
7402,love mike but i understand why you don’t say what you really want to say!!!!  love ya bro
7404,"mike rowe, no one else can make shoveling manure look honorable, you should run for office... love ya man!"
7411,most of those jobs the corporations want an already experienced person to apply. modern corporations do not train and if they do they do very little.
7415,"i'm glad i have higher ed and have been able to use it, but it is possible to make a substantial and fufilling life as a tradesman. no one should disrespect ""lower"" ed jobs."
7417,funny how politicians always seem to promote ai in the workplace but never in their own workplace. i guess a workplace requires intelligence before there’s a need to make it artificial; something clearly lacking in politics...
7418,"""what do you mean i have to wait four days for a plumber?"" where i live depending on the time of year... it's not uncommon to wait five. i had to wait 10 for an electrician."
7419,"i was waiting for tucker to say..""i made it myself!"" ..lol"
7420,"unfortunately california isusing immigrant labor, hiring conglomerate contractors licensed in three or four states to accomplish substandard work"
7424,"""for the common good,"" says obama, a freemason.  that is masonic vernacular, speaking of a dualistic ying-yang like principle where one may do good and evil deeds."
7430,government harnessing ai for the common good:  terminator!!
7431,"first off, love, love love love you tucker! 
obama said diversity would be our greatest strength, well just look around we know that’s a big fat lie ."
7433,"mike tow is a lier. there are
not that many jobs available"
7438,good idea
7441,the talmud has a saying that it is shameful.... shameful... to work with your hands. that means you are a failure.  there's something disgusting about that.
7442,the bread for obama's toast this morning... who does he think got it to the store? does he think the fairies bring it?
7443,"obama is a walking breathing example of artificial intelligence, in a sense that his intelligence was always artificial...."
7447,"why should the government promote human skilled labor when mechanization has already taken over? it makes no sense for them to do that because its cheaper to use machines. they dont think in terms of human compassion, what matters to them is the accumulation of money"
7455,the clip you are watching is ai generated.
7457,"a question ai will never answer, especially ai.gov.  ai, account and itemize every tax dollars spent by the us government."
7458,"i guess obama is our grey-haired sage now. as if he knows the first thing about ai. as if he knows the first thing about the private sector or commerce or generating wealth through products and actual services. just leave us alone, guy. zero respect to this poser."
7459,the govt will do the common good for man kind that's worth roughly over 100 to 200 million bucks!
7461,for every 5 skilled tradesmen that retires only 2 are learning to fill the position... unfortunately my kids can’t see the major opportunity this is for them
7464,"this is the education our government has given us, thru public school, to compete with other countries. there is no competing with ai."
7468,for obama the common good means communism
7469,that table is perfectly gorgeous and useful. every artist needs to write his name on every piece of work they create. please!
7471,i’m self taught with doing body work and paint on cars. no training but i deal with high end luxury now. that’s after 4 years of hard work when i left construction after 10 years with my red seal
7475,"dear obama, please go away you and your communist party has done so much damage to our once great country!"
7477,obama is looking for a few good disinformation artists.
7479,it started with self service in the food and grocery industry. the people in power pushing for ai really hate themselves and human contact.
7484,ai is a hoax. it's a program run by the government programmed by the government. and they are selling it as truth and intelligence. but if it's programmed by the government it is far from intelligent. and it's all lies.
7487,more of barry’s shovel ready bs. there is probably a three-page dei statement to fill out at the gov ai site.
7488,grateful for you tucker
7490,i misread the title and 100% thought that was an ai obama
7491,we can be super intelligent and work a blue collar job.. look at rock hound in armageddon
7494,"obama,financed iran,obama,gave us homosexual marriage,obama,gave us today's ukraine war,obama,gave us socialist medicine,obama,went on a apology tour bowing to all dictators,obama,multiplied abortion clinics especially in black/latino communities..now,obama supports a.i.,watch out.."
7498,"mr rowe is a legend. what an excellent point. this is constant notion that people that go into the trades are people which didn't get the grades to go to university. 

this pr completely neglects people which genuinely want to go into the trades and are also intellectually curious hungry and inquisitive people"
7499,this whole video is ai......
7504,mike rowe and tucker carlson are the two most attractive and intelligent men  in my opinion besides clint eastwood.
7506,"you know why you lost to sociologist , i figured out what harm you are doing, unfortunately the mail who introduced me in your dirty play was very good friend of mine and i lost a lot money because i trusted. you ai freaks own me money as a minimum"
7508,i've been a hairstylist for almost 30-yrs.. did traditional 'higher ed' for 2-yrs and hated it.. i love my profession and have always encouraged others to consider trade schools.. 
7509,"two educated millionaires telling the peasants they don't need an education, lol!"
7510,"mike is clueless. there's a shortage of good paying construction jobs. it pays as much to work in a warehouse, home depot or drive a truck because you need green card for those jobs."
7515,"if you have ever gone down a rabbit hole talking to a none human on the phone , trying to answer your questions , then we can all agree , ai has a long way to go !"
7516,exactly. we have access to some of the greatest teachers & successful men/women of all ti.e through the internet. the need to attend an over-priced semi-adult daycare (college) is not necessary for a majority of people.
7518,"i only came to say, who gaf what obama thinks about anything. goodbye."
7519,thank you mr.rowe and mr.carlson i appreciate you both. as always thoughts and prayers. 
7520,"full stack dev, ama award 2007, former healthcare exec; i did the common good, they used it for evil, i'm done helping them. retired and staying that way."
7523,love everything i see mike rowe doing for men and supporting and championing tradesmen
7528,"mike rowe

7529,"as usual, mike nails it! i've been a fan of manual training always 'cause that's how i grew up and made my career. and enough ""higher learning"" rubbed off that i was able to grow with that knowledge to scientific levels. all on a high school education. you two do it and we'll back you up!"
7530,"there is no long-term positive outcome with ai. it will quickly become the software by which the elite will control all facets of life, and later, will become ungovernable."
7531,"mike rowe is right about finding that balance, being an interesting and interested person"
7532,"hmmm... no. liberal arts education matters not in the trades. actually, respectfully, your degrading the folks who choose a trade. trades run this country. bless those who choose to learn a business from the bottom to the top."
7533,"love mike rowe, but my man only has one topic."
7539,ai with cern is going to destroy america and the world if the citizens don't step in to stop the globalist. their very evil.
7542,"tucker, you’re awesome, but mike rowe i would like to buy you a beer... come to san diego. i live in a little town called la mesa. we have lots of micro breweries and we can talk about  nichi.   i’ll buy the beers.... seriously."
7543,has mike rowe had a sit down with trump? i think the two great minds and doers would give a whole bunch of people a path to prosperity. do it!!
7545,ai will destroy working people!
7548,"my dad, who was a trained classical violinist, made his living as a house painter. he loved books and ideas, and he took a lot of pride in the houses he painted."
7554,ai =another idiot.  a human is programming and it is their school of thought.
7557,i’m a diesel mechanic making very good money. i think we need to get more women in the trades especially mechanic trade because woman are great at attention to detail
7558,"true,ai will replace human workforce but ai has limit even have advantage & disanvantages terms of using"
7564,"the man behind brandon, ai skynet, not the movie."
7568,"you're in my top five role models tucker, love you and thank you for helping me see i needed to turn my life around! i owe you one brother "
