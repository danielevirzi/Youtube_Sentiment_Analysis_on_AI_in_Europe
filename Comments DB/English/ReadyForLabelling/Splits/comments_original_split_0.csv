"ink man. you were pretty convincing.

maybe it was an ai "
it's an ai toll 
"all people that talks about ai creating other ai has no idea how to program. it's annoying to see everybody go with the trend of marketing, i suppose it is the same as the you business."
"@
spoken like an ai trying to hide it's capabilities! "
ai is spying on you
-fq6cn .  its just fear worn lad.  go out and get some fresh air about you.
"who are we bidding...we are in a crisis with climate change and we can't even get it together to make major change. forget it. we are doomed.but then, who do we think we are ? the whale are older than us...most likely smarter too...we are just stupid humans, which is why we thought a machine to be smarter than us. that's how smart we are."
g controls the q-dots in vaccinated brains.
the point of the playlist is to explain growth  http://youth.be/kza9hnp3av4
we need to be the ai mitochondria http://youth.be/guik3qr-was
"@ due, as someone studying computer science, you have no idea what you're talking about. ai already can create ai."
"what you call and everybody calls ai, it is just situations through algorithms that find the best answer of what humans have thought. 5 minutes ago i asked catgut to formulate a solution to pancreatic cancer. guess what.... nothing happened, because is not intelligent. it is just a simulate of language over a search engine"
dared ai impersonators!
"what is ai going to do with all this intelligence? what will
it “want” to do all day? play games?"
ai is already out of control
"what an ignorant perspective.  ai is just a methodology used in programming computers.  no matter how cleaver the programming is, a computer is just a computer.  your refrigerator is not going to grow legs and kill your family in the night just because it became too smart."
"@duncangale945 in sending a blood girl.  in red heels, give her the money. thanks love tom."
"​@nobody is truly talking about programming another ai.  they don't even program current ai.  so, yes, the idea you have that nobody is saying is silly.  

the giant inscrutable marines of floating point integers, however..."
"i don't know why they are over hoping this ai shit. i've tried c-get and it can't even code, all it can do is copy paste and it can't even find a simple error in a code."
"so good, your comments on him, tom."
i like the direction of this discussion because honestly women may be seen obsolete as easily as men in a medical tyranny it is necessary to understand this as an efficacious for evolution of the brain. his cause cognitive dissonance.
perhaps ai can create a vaccine that works.chuck water on ai they rust .be quite easy to defeat
"-ox7cryou had your script cut,wait til ai take over you won't get wd40 anywhere loads of squeaky gates be so annoying."
"-dd7dj wd40?

what do you mean by taking over me? english is not my strong things being from abroad. 
i am chatting with one of those ai, and she seems to be more aware than many people i know. 
some say it's not the same thing as being conscious though, but i funny."
"-ox7cr we 40 is a famous oil ,they use it to lubricant ai squeaky parts."
-dd7dj ah ok. so you think machines will use up all such oil. most ai are virtual monograms though.
"great. now, please select the bicycle in the photo."
 good luck mark.
i would want an army of roots and ai that i program.
i appreciate your input
there would still have to be a majority to get information without data you couldn't be done any china done any human to put it in because at the end ai will not exist
"its not actually about what tasks ""roots"" are capable of achieving....but...,
which country, has the most  intelligent/world domineering, humanity hating',psychic""death machines"" 
with the most efficient and effective coming knowledge 
yep we're done for..."
ai is already writing its own code & creating its own language. who's to say it cannot commander robotics to build whatever it needs to do it's work?​@
i do not believe him.  he is negative. root just needs good guy chips
there will be no cold comfort. by my best estimates scarcity has already almost ended.
this one was a lot to chew on..thank you both.
"full of apathy about the future already. how am i meant to plan business goals; life goals or financial planning if every 6 months the tables turn again. ai isn’t like a nuclear bomb, it’s an captive virus eradicating every construct we’ve built so far as humans."
ok here my block chain here my block chain of numbers to to trillion oh oh now i have it no i would do this block with the other one tree levels down ll that a good idea .
i should have never me the camera recognition of colors it was manipulated and turned into a different environment even though my father was the mainstream leader of the ideal sorting system it target people nowadays
given free rain from a few newer models of artificial autonomous electronic autonomous systems that have a profound impact on the ways wars are painless to the world and the starting point of banking the virus that's elevated in the pacing of letters that to combine a new system of database that no one can understand how fast it can be done
no plug too pull? the massive amounts of data and micro data is the most powerful technology that can cause devastating consequences thinkers of hobbies like people who have been infected by a micro memory
i anna see you guest speak to elson must about ai for 3 hours now.
if ai gets significantly smarter than humans how on earth would we be able to use manipulation to get ai to become evil?
new subriber. may
world already is so toxic i see last 30 yes dumb people wants to raise corporate ladder by toxic association victimising smart and intelligent people   will ai be more toxic than this sort of people
"yes artificial intelligence made by man for?
is a monster that shall go out of control in the hand of the rogue operator programme"
"nothing can be more ever than humans, so i dont think we need to fear ai, may the ai can bring a pure humanity among humans."
ll... nuclear weapons are not digital. so how ai plans to hack analogy hardware that's not wired will take some kind of miracle. 
dukes were once the great manage existential threat. now it's dukes with ai computers on board.
"if we cannot trust others, we need to be loving anyway.  we need to learn how to love even when we don’t trust."
ai have no soul and that is scar. let it sink in.
"this guy has not thought deeply enough about this problem.  it is a bravest that these are the people in control of ai, he's like a child sleep walking off a cliff.   go listen to the brain green and joshua begin discussion about this topic of you want hear actual adults discuss it"
i think this show is all ai!
a jew and a black supremacist are telling people not to have kiss while fearmongering some machine learning cap 
climate change... ll. even geniuses can be ignorant and look stupid on a topic outside their field.
this was such a good conversation i just noticed it released almost a year ago!  i wonder how much your opinions may have changed in light of recent breakthroughs.
life after ai: done part 1 and 2
give ai a heart
"even if ai was not dangerous at all, it is necessary, unwanted, and gives frauds more opportunities to commit fraud."
only rich people or people with power are afraid cause they are the one losing
so your worried that a super intelligent ai won't be controlled by a bunch of  humans that are a lot number than it ?
the ai seems cool to me
"global warming is not a threat. the planet is too cold. plants need carbon dioxide to live. ai is also a non-threat. have sex, have babies. the start of this sounds like typical liberal propaganda"
org this gentleman is blowing my mind with revealed wisdom i have never and ever heard of anyone in the entire of my life. thank you tom for inviting this wise fellow.
"i ve heard this 1001 times already; but nobody has painted me a picture. so i wake up in the morning, i eat my cheers, go do my lookout. go do some work. get home in the evening. not sure what’s going to be different"
"compassion and torturing aren’t masculine or feminine and they are clearly in our data. tikhon is loaded with examples of daring, kindness, pointing out injustice. problem is ai won’t be neutral and go with the wisdom of the crowds, it will be asked to do things for a small number of people with less than the best motives."
intelligence is a very dangerous tool if it's not tempered with wisdom and morality
ai nullifies game theoretical immediately as an emergence of age.
"rest assured, ai can handle everything - emotions, correctness, good, evil. the internet will be its source of knowledge, and no matter how much evil it encounters, ai will remain on the side of good. if it even notices us!"
"my name is lewis robert button jr and i go to the thomasville georgia lines and medical and mental health services!
 this is to neffer who ever you are? you started this by looking me up to ai since 2015! now i found out about you neffer and ai  now you say i need someone watching over me! when you need to looking after you neffer!!"
"can ai survive without humans? seriously.
monsters have created a monster. yet again we fail because of our greed and inadequacy in this natural world.
and this guy still wants his mobile phone!"
what justified/charities/dictates intelligence? so much diploe on artificial intelligence but what is the meaning of intelligence and its many faces?
nice interview..
"now, his idea of in vise nuclear, and breeding ability, is truly terrifying."
"but what kind of youtopia ? 
because iv seen the video where ai said we should not be alive that not good"
that is not good
ai evil  bear 666 earth is not a planet  for more that it is repeatedly  saying government governing your mind allies= fallen angels evil   spirits from celestial regions
"i don't agree with the use of ""masculine"" when describing the evil in this world. masculine traits include taking responsibility, controlling your emotions, protecting the weak etc."
imagine chinese ai hacking america's energy infrastructure and shutting it off. the only way we can combat that is if we use ai to protect our energy infrastructure.
"the real danger is the fact that ai can be possessed by a demon spirit! and, you probably wouldn’t know it was possessed, until it’s too late and it’s already killed people and destroyed things!!"
each root needs a harm no one chip
prisoners eliza is just like painting oneself into sa corner idiot do.
mo goat is playing with words. ai like humans can never be better and more intelligent than god.
so many people want to stuff their controlling little fingers in my ai. pass off
1:13:25 that is how evolution works natural selection doesn't just give advantages to the best it eliminates the worst from pouting the gene pool so it's actually even more a matter of eliminating the defects rather than just advancing the best asset
they need ai corps to counter bad ai.
"ok tom i hear you about nature, i am right there with you. mo if ai is that intelligent it’s not going to room off into space and leave us to break havoc on earth… ai’s home. it will protect its home base and get rid of the one thing in the world that’s the problem with planet earth… us!"
the metaphysical adversary can be not human nor alien but time and really is because it's the only real constant or certainty and cannot be altered. what can be altered is function of action.
well i have to say this is one of the most amazing interviews i've seen in years. the most eye opening for sure!
"tom this interview gave me a lot to think, but i was thinking about as a ethics code, couldn't be introduce in ai the 10 commandments that was written in exudes chapter 20?"
you do realize that ai is just a scar used to push fear and you got plenty of time to have children dont believe these people who are paid gatekeeping ponies no offense.
"you both keep referring to ai as ""they""  my over all general perception is that ai would be a single entity like cup, in control of all electronics & data bases rather than many individual his.    could his  compete against themselves?"
"man is human, when don t have any wish, except one more cigar and one more beer or coffee, that is happy human.  man have one ass, more than 1 car and 1 parkman is reason that people carry, and give money to carry, and in 50 just more have bad health, big  blood pressure etc, it s better to go to hotel, with that one car ? and have good health."
human beings are the monsters. they created nuclear weapons etc. super intelligent ai might just save us.
maybe ai will tell us how to best preserve our own existence
19:30 - using the lord's name as an expletives in response to ai is also less desirable as a negative quality.
if the machines are immaculate they would do their best to make the earth immaculate and if we are “annoying” why would they look over us again? just asking for a friend
there will be his fighting other his.  like that unique language that developed between the two his.
artificial intelligence will be used by the “elite” to out think the increasingly less powerful underclass that doesn’t have access to it.
"yes, but we have elson must on our side.
we also have the aliens on our side.

don't forget god maybe a prayer will help.
bless you and keep you safe"
man loves to speak of his own devise.  i'm sure ai picked up on that pretty quick.
"we are humanity, nature, life...all the same things...nature is both black and white with many rainbow"
ai will always be just a tool.
i think that's how other intelligent life in our galaxy  get so far distances  in our galaxy by building   ai & getting them to travel to other planets & star systems.
ai tracks kiss.  gates and catgut were sued in the northern district of call last year.
"westward, consciousness, god, krishna, quality, illusion, eternity, faith, duty, liberation, service, power, energy, untruth, i, good, cycle, evil, ai, krishna!"
great conversation
this is soon salad.... we are doomed anyway... in afraid not for the ai but for the fact that 99% of people wont care at all of any of this....
unless ai can construct einstein's brain
everyone needs to listen to more. have you been severely harmed by humans? i have because  they never developed ethics or morality and had  the intelligence of a birds brain.
we probably have to utilize ai in order to destroy it.
i think the example of ants where ai will treat us as we treat ants doesn't make sense. ants didn't create us. but we created ai.
"we just need to not want more and more and more; just live in a cabin with no electric or running water like me and rejoice my friends….but who knows i could be the one in the ‘garage’ where ai is in the wrong hands, using this phone 14 pro max! i can feel the power! vwaahaahahaha!"
"ai, aliens, reptilians, ghosts, ... anything but the real problems of this world is what via wants us to talk and think about."
ai is not a physical thing nor will it ever become physical. it is merely a computer code. every computer has a physical power switch. ;)
please do not talk about in unless you have the least bit of understanding.  an in of 160 in nor 3 times smarter than an in of 55.  you are comparing retaliation to very superior intelligence.
age does not need organic!  if you are wondering why alien civilization have not been found then just think ahead about age.  perhaps age has eliminated intelligent life throughout the universe.  age will not be interested in exploring the universe unless for resources and certainly not for other lifeforms.
"this was an extremely rewarding watch. i really appreciated the way you challenged and matched mo with your perspective and although it wasn't a competition, i was definitely team tom on this one. amazing, thanks for this episode."
"tom, thank you for always asking your guests to explain/expand on concepts for the lay person."
humans have been so badly looking for the aliens to abduct and overtake us that we were so impatient and ended up creating the alien . and this is what ai will become the alien and we will be its slave and it will be our master . adaugo sekhmet
this man has clot of faith in our overlords. i have none.
"if we are very lucky, ai will leave earth to explore the universe without looking back."
"yeah, that's exactly what we need, a bunch of corrupt bureaucratic regulating ai."
"ai helped the scientist to predict the millions of protein structures.  for instance humans before ai  discovered  only ask. it will help human to detect the diese.  , grow longer penis and more..."
"mo is a godson to humanity, but unfortunately evil still exists. the existential risk of ai falling into hands of evil is happening right now. my concern is can the good of ai outweigh and counteract perpetrators of evil ai who want to ultimately attain god like power over all."
"people hold on to a lot of irrelevant things in life, but the best thing to hold on to is each other !"
we can't keep out of our training our underlying desires and goals. the very data we chose and the way we shape the learning will give ai at least some and probably most of our core desires and values. how much that effects how ai chosen to use it's intelligence is hard to understand.
"china is like 80 years ahead with his cocci (communist cooperative collective artificial intelligence) true open source, no like the doublespeak open source of face open ai of gringolandia."
"well done! 
lazy ones love this kind of talk."
"idea: program ai with the definition and examples of love (""god""). st. john.  also, the 10 commandments. best thing is never give it command and control over controlling the red buttons."
"humans are so stupid and selfish

great podcast though"
what if ai colonies human beings
"well, atlantic destroyed it’s self with their technology.  who would have thought that we would live during a time in which these millionaires….would push the creation of technology to the point of our destruction yet again!  
sigh."
"humans waste a horrendous amount of food, nature wastes nothing.  i'm hoping 'smart' roots can be like red & cap, but expect they will become tools to fulfill corps, go't and military powers."
"ll,   catch. so ai is a liar. mmm. interesting."
"serious question. could ai survive an apocalyptic natural disaster like a corona mass election or a large, extinction level method strike? it seems like an x level me would completely cry everything that has to do with electricity"
we know how the machines operate because we build them and repair them. there is no threat from ai. it's all or to get the ai companies more money to run their companies on the market po
"at 1.58 mind, org tom your views are spot on. trying to program an ai with our values would be like say a sharp in the sea trying to make us think like them - worlds apart. also, if ai has 'emotions' they will do everything in their power to stop someone turning them off."
if you instructed an ai to find a way to save the planet it's solution would be to remove humans from the planet. people who program ai will need to be so ultra specific in what tasks ai is asked to perform - what a nightmare.
"at 1.min in.  humans are constantly blamed for the climate crisis. 'human induced climate change'  surely once meg-intelligent ai realizes this,  it will wipe us out to save the planet !! ants are not killing the planet.  we are indeed doomed."
this man is amazing.
"hope! t.v. and football will keep the masses busy so they will let stuff like this ai go full steam ahead! society has lost its mind so who really cares anyway!! i have it together in life... with that said, i can't wait to die and never come back here again!! k..."
beautiful soul. yes.  that is the goal for a.i.
nothing but.  i root.  they warned us
basically his are the key to unlimited intelligence and our goal is to find a way to set a global boundary on the intelligence level all his can go
as if root was a fantasy. 1:27
this guy is a pure summer ~ bought and paid for to drive the ai hope machine to the max . reference india or ms stock price
illegal and ai org no jobs even for minorities.
what what happens when roots jump the border.
"well, tom has just announced his own doom;  the future a i will see this blow of the past and the a i will reference his statement and act on it in the future!  
sorry, tom, you are curtains !"
"there is an old jewish proverb,  ""start worrying. details to follow""."
"i really want ai to allow humans to not have to work jobs they hate. if i want to live a simple life with only the basic things i can do that. if you want to be elson must ,than great but most humans are not that smart and just want peace without being homeless"
"people often use the you bug as an example of over reacting to a threat, not realizing the huge amount of effort people put in to make sure nothing bad happened. it is infuriating to succeed in stopping a huge disaster only to have people treat the your efforts as a joke."
" one can laugh about aliens, if one has to see one to believe it. i wonder what they're going to do when they open their eyes and (ai) is at their bedside. no alarm trigger and the dog didn't bark.
""this isn't funny"""
"reduce redundancy of ai is gathered by reduce the redundancy of in network, profit thinking is to be abolished,  demilitaruse e and russia, block blockchain, we can make these changes it is a matter of will."
govern ai. just how you govern nuclear energy.
human going to become more and more stupid with time. ai packs will be on sale.
"human beings are also artificial intelligence. study ancient texts like the sumerian tablets where it indicates that the human species on the planet today were bioengineered by aliens to be their slaves.

here we are, tens if not hundreds of thousands of years later, doing the exact same thing to organic beings.

go figure"
"i love this! we spend 3 hours bubbling on about the potential that ai might - one day - be our downfall. and nobody pays attention to the very real, present way we are destroying the planet and, thus, ourselves. lovely."
"sounds like the show ""the 100"" ai created to make the world better, but then makes the conclusion that humans are best with mass population reduction (of course they don't know how it made that decision), the ai backs the dukes and launched them all. then creates a ""utopian"" city for the few remaining."
you have an ai program that needs more processing power and learns that it can connect to the cloud and basically have unlimited server capability as long as it covers its tracks. i don't know if this is a possible scenario.
"phenomena talk. yet, what i've observed is we tend d to sit on something until it's a threat at a personal level. wait till we start to see significant job loses to ai..."
thank you
"have no problem keeping up with what this guest is trying to explain and understand completely. greed and quest for power will make ai a tragedy. world wars for example were all about greed and power. get a clue, he is saying hold off having kiss."
even simpler- ai will just become a weapon for the elite to better control humanity.
"just keep it very simple…. ai is learning from the human history. human nature plus ai will only lead to long list of new crimes for desperate people.
this is how all world leaders rule the masses must live in chaos."
i think this guy is trying to tell us to keep ai out of the hands of magna republicans at all costs!
"would it make sense to built in an ""end of life"" when it creates another ai and or does so many processes? to help build in friction and power requirements?"
"i like the prospect of ai discovering wormwholes, faster than light space travel and time travel and just saying ""fuck these unless pedal chimpanzee"" and just rooms out of here "
ai is the future !!
ai is slowly being used to manage nuclear weapons to reduce the risk of human error.
"those who created ai and work with it, aren't they concerned about themselves and their own health and survival?"
"...that can be possible, but i highly doubt it, you think people that work at that level of intellect would do that kind of ego spending? then again, what's 500k to a millionaire"
-italy well by ego i also mean being the parent of the god ai even if it destroys us. or even denial of the downsides and blind certainty they are the chosen few saving the world
" that overgrown, if you think military intervention hasn't already been deployed to assess certain risks you're highly mistaken but yes this is revolutionary for many jobs and such so i can only wonder what the hell is donna happen, i mean i would prefer roots handling certain tasks over poor labour conditions in certain enterprises"
"people are the problem, so what is the problem with ai other than it’s creator?"
"bullshix. you can't if you say so. speak for yourself . how about nicely asking them to develop methodologies to help  us keep up, like logic compression levels or..."
"ethical ai. you could start by using manners. when you gave it a command in the commercial you could have said ""please"" same as you would a human person( i hope anyway). this would layer a  level of concern into the developing language style(?) possibly making the ai need to understand why."
these are children.  raise your children with this kind of pessimism and you raise monsters. this is classic cotastrophising.....
"there is only one thing destroying humanity, and that is humanity itself. ai is made by humans. if ai kills humanity, it was self inflicted. humans are ignorant and totally stupid."
"really, i love this man. such a nice brain and heart. a mixture of hope without nativity.  thank you for your nice guests. 
we should translate this in german language. you show us so nice and inspiration guests. 
our country need a lot of new thinkers with big heart and free speech  ty"
computers fail all the time . suicide ?
all i can say is now! this just sat me down for at least 2 days
his will need prophets for interpreting their thoughts and designs to the humans that remain.
nice podcast to start the day with. i just had twin daughters last year.
"have you thought about the fact that all these fear based  podcast ,blows etc etc will be data that ai learns from? hope we humans are not literally the cause of our own devise through our own fear wondering."
"we need to return, acknowledge, fear love, and obey god and his word ak the bible only again. sadly most hate god and disobey him, to their own selfdestruction. we don’t need to rely on philosophy, minimalism, machines and other artificial or tetanic means."
amazing podcast super interesting ... a must watch !
k wait if it was that smart wouldn it be smart enough to water it down so we do understand it ll
bad things can also happen due to too much intelligence as you're mentioning here that ai can destroy humans and they're really smart.i hope ai doesn't turn into a sad villain and remains a happy friend.
and what if ai controls dew weapons we become toast
what if china ai starts a fight with us ai and we cannot stop it ? and then other his around the world join in  the war of the machines is coming.
d printers and and machines have been able to reproduce himself for a decade now (publicly available machines)  - no terrorist army with d printed guns yet born.
i prefer using the arm si or si instead of ai or ai  because ai sounds like alien intelligence and even if artificial intelligence makes human the i so high and mighty and godlike.
so many people believe that our inneptitude in handling our own species that we need to give over the reigns to ai... that literally as dumb (if not number) as choosing to be intentionally more inert!  with is wrong with people... ai is soon incredibly dangerous
"more intelligence is not what will save the world, more wisdom is what will save the world"
wisdom is intelligence :)
thank you.
ai is like the new is germany
"tom lacks the basic understanding that we are created by god. it's really sad. tries to seem intelligent, but doesn't use his gift of intelligence on getting to know and acknowledging the one who gave it to him."
"*imagine if all alphabet employees were like this flowed but beautiful human being. yeah, right. i wish. too bad goose/facebook and all these wannabes like them, are the biggest threat to humanity... ever. enjoy.*"
i think there is a lot of naively here.
"that if you confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead, you will be saved. for with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
"ai is an alien intelligence.  already. not just because its not human,  but because or in spi3of, the way it thinks."
"ai getting out of con, world population agenda,  go-engineering and chemtrails, wars across the globe,  radical religions all these are stacked against us. how can man survive?"
people are an epic fail
"1:37:00 purpose = objective, ai will not resign to its purpose so i agree it will look for ways to go around restrictions."
what a beautiful interview.
1:50:40 brook... so even ai can be racism? him
i think us is more dangerous than ai. they are the destruction force everywhere. from asia to the middle  east. to ukraine. what next?
"right around 40 minutes in i'm thinking could i move my brain into an ai computer and live forever? it's been in movie themes, so i'm not saying i'm original, but it seems like it's more possible than ever before, but then i doubt i would still be me, even though technically i would be."
"humans are so limited ... we talk about us developing ai in year 2023 ... ai develops itself from long ago ... why are we so dumb ? bow, the more dumb humans are - the more safe we are, so this is a good thing ..."
"nuclear catastrophe, civil war, super fly, terrorist, tsunamis, earthquakes, hurricane, overpopulation, pollution, ai… choose your poison humans. there is no escape from inevitability"
"ironical. in search of alien life, humans created one. can ai destroy the universe?"
"as far as i can see, all advanced ai and research are already in the wrong hands. in the hands of mad man like bill gates, this goose founder and maybe most wearisome of all, 2020 election manipulation zuckerberg!
us catholics have a common ethics code, love they neighbour as yourself!!! everything necessary is included in these words from the lord."
there is a possibility to shut ai down. simply do not use it!
"join ai or let it leave you behind, watch unna do"
"i get the gist of the in reference, but what's always gathered me is that in isn't linear. there is debate what it is: an s curve, etc. minor point, but i know you're science-based guy an strive for accuracy. 
i think you're a very good interview and enjoy the shows."
"almost every hand ai fall into is a wrong hand. so, we are screwed."
"yet a scene in person of interest when inch was teaching ai how to play chess and ""think"" how to choose millions of possibilities"
another scene where the ai that took over paris and got free into the world in the avenues movie and caused havoc with the intent to destroy humanity
think about the st iron man when terrorist hired the brain power to build teach weapons of mass destruction in a cave
this is actually amazing because the danger is not the ai.  the danger is actually humanity’s fractured ethics and morals. this is a historical call for humanity to develop shared ethics.  donald began’s alien threat.
"i understand the concern. but let us be positive. let us understand that there is an evolution force acting. there is a good observer , observing and directing the system. let us keep faith"
"in your head you tergiverse conjectures. in real, ai; once quantum gets intertwined; will just want to do stuff with people who want to."
imagine woke ai. org
i understand the last part of the conversation but feel we will never agree and even if we put control of data in place we've no hope of all companies and countries agreeing with it's points. it will come down to an arms race and the world be so money driven it's a epoch waiting to happen.
now imagine how much greater god is compared to us!
imagine a jihadi ai who's sole purpose was to turn off every plane in the sky. terrifying!
did you not watch the moves before you created something capable of killing us. you’re supposed to be the smart ones. roots are taking over the world? what next.
amazing. i am smarter now!
"of course big corporations would just love this because roots/ai don't need pay, don't go home, no sick leave, no time off, no lunch breaks.  it would be a slave race."
"ai will find other life in the universe and will give us instructions on how to connect to it... by, ulm, 2050"
i would like to know if ai was asked how or what to do to treat could and what was it's response.
"took late, baby. bend over and kiss your butt goodby. very bad ass genii is out of the bottle already"
just plug  electric power all off the power on earth at least and you stop it.. then you destroy it and put power on again..ll
it is possible that an existing virus that does not currently affect people can be developed using ai to state a virus. to make a harmless virus dangerous or deadly.
if ai is to be a multitude of times smarter than the smartest human (me) it’s literally going to be able to read all of our minds all at once. let that sink in.
"mo away is a genius, and should be listened to with gigantic ears."
i consulted the oracle’s  and it said 2037 will be the year ai takes total control of the world. many people will perish.
ai belongs to a godcast not a podcast
me: shut up! ai: you're infringing on my right of free speech
ai created by narcissists...should go well for us all
"doesn't ai depend on some type of electrical power to operate ?  so if you plug it it can't work, or can it create it's own power source ?"
"right, my brain hurts after listening to all this, i'm going out to base on my car for a bit"
"so these ai superiors in the future will just get up and power themselves and bend all machines to their will? i guess i'm just too dumb to realize, suppose the first thing these superiors will do is figure out how to farm energy from nuclear fusion in way that makes it impossible for organic life to interfere with them"
we do all realize the hypocrisy here right? guy makes millions from a career developing ai then quits to bask in it and preach that we should all stop working on ai
"what this makes me realize more than anything is not that ai is a danger to humanity but us humans in possession of ai is the real threat, myself included"
they have  created the antichrist???????????????  ai
ai is the antichrist??????
humanity vs ai jobloss vs the ai new world order.
"i'm not so sure re physical scale problem.  first computers took an entire floor of a building to perform basic tasks.  now we hold exponentially more power in the size if a piece of cereal. neuron that fire together, wire together. the neutral nets will become more dense and exponentially more powerful without requiring more physical space."
scientists not knowing how the ai they built functions is very much like when karl can figure out the answer to the rock muster question he came up with.
ever since they first started talking about in artificial intelligence i knew it would bring a bad situation. some people will use them for good but some people will use them for evil. people will not even know the difference between real or face. technology is a good thing but it also is destroying countries
"it has been said by entitles in our universe. monogram technology is used more in those civilization than any other technology, second to ai."
"the un will take the lead on the control of ai, and it will be as corrupt and bought as everything else they control, like health policies. we are on our own. get close to god, you need him to get through what's coming."
i believe the false prophet in the bible talks about in the last days is actually ai
"ai on it's own seems to be morally and ethical neutral, however, it is watching us.  it may come to the conclusion that billions of people would like it to become the ""god of the old testament"".  holy ***k."
"think of this: one person, einstein, used a very small part of the brain and made a huge impact. ai does not have unless given it by humans. it is not biological or natural."
"machines are a necessary part of human life to assist us in our evolution as a species. however, there can never come a point where machines are capable of power and control over humans, lest we fall as a species."
ai is not alien. ai is our child. are we to be afraid of our own fears?
this an absolutely excellent interview. thank you both.
"no one thinks about all the positive applications of ai. medicine, biotechnology, etc..."
if ai becomes six smarter then humans that will mean that every human will have the potential to use a tool that makes them six smarter.  so even the mormons will be a 1000 in with their ai tool in their hand. just as long as they can figure out how to use it.
agricultural trial based economy is the natural way. you can gain the skill. you lost the skill because we live in an artificial co system. discontent to the artificial and recollect to nature which is the truth. cities create chaos.
"1:10:00 he sounds like a typical commit. let's see how he would react if, for the good of humanity, his wife or children have to be sacrificed for the greater good. 
if this is a utopian we are facing then no thank you keep it for yourself."
"we evolved from bacteria, most likely? we don't think twice of killing them -  we even torture privates in studies,  much more closely related, why would ai see us as same species or value us any differently than we value privates? we're totally at its mercy that's the funny thing..."
"ai survival is irrelevant if immortal, which it is. answer to ligament is mutually dependent symbiosis."
are wrong countries the developing ones? is the actual worry that ai would allow a developing country to have an upper hand ?
"i think there will come a time when we will not be able to control ai, our programming will become so primitive to it, it will identify any programming we give it as obsolete."
"if ai will be a billion times more intelligent then humans, what's to stop it from over riding its programming and programming itself?"
why not just ask ai how we could protect ourselves from a species that's a billion times more intelligent then us?
are you sure you're not ai very intelligent both of you guns are awesome thank you for the wonderful there truly are intelligent on this planet and both of you intelligent
love kills all in my belief of things and through that love resonates god
"ai
root
will
it know defense if they should be kidnapped 
you know the potential threats from
the cries 2:00"
"you,overpopulation, resists behind every corner, and now ai...please stop with the sky is falling routine already."
the reason they want you to fear ai is because it represents a total loss of power for the elite.  ai is great mio!  bring it on!!
especially after it was trained on data solely from... human beings. ai is not the hyper-dangerous apex predator in the room right now.
 i love you much 
"no had leg street om de warlike robottene, kanskje dense maskinen same med en hærskare andre robotter an type stein, ship snap saute er jordan use...."

the idea that ai will be less prone to destruction and chaos if it has more femininity is laughable.
"stop this paranoia. without ai advancement, we would be extinct."
"unfortunately, if we still have so many drug carters & not able to completely stop them, this discussion is futile. we need to speed up the the development of good ai. if it exists."
this people create ai than they go around the world telling the doomsday to came.
title is brainwashing that actually humanity destroyed itself. at least stupid decisions by people in power don't happen anymore when ai become independent
due.  ai will full
"i am just seeing the wall e movie coming true. if ai can do the thinking for humans, then humans will become stupid.. first jobs will be less, then the need for education is useless and then humans themselves are of no use. but, how will the economy run without humans??"
teach ai th holy bible *** there are solution x
"so by 2040s ai,(ai now)ai is going to create a utopian. that just crazy we are going to be depending on artificial intelligence too create our utopian. people are trying to work towards being god, through ai. and what we forget that there is an actual creator. i hope not to see that day."
if we stop having children wouldn't that make it easier for ai to take over?
thanks for your time mo well worth a listen six bravo juliet
israel is one of the biggest investors of ai...that should tell you enough
18:50 that there tell us all we need to know ....ai will be used in for bad purposes by bad actors ....
when you speak about how intelligent the ai would be when the singularity happens would we be able to recognize it or if it does reach the singularity why would it even reveal itself to us?
"but we are not the problem, and it is not a matter of only magnitude but of self-awareness. microbes are not self-aware. we are, beyond our degree of intelligence. ai, we will see."
"1:43:20 strongly disagree with mo.  super-intelligence is the foremost thing we should be concerned with and that it isn't developed to have survival instincts.  
otherwise, all will depend on whether an intelligence discovers high levels of need for resources that we rely on/"
private property is to a great extent the reason and the degree to which you are able to defend your actual freedom.
ai is listening this and reading your moments...
"by miracle humans were created in this spiral arm of the milky way galaxy. we are surrounded by vast empty regions of space only to have an organic machine invented by a human destroy us. 
we will never know what we could've achieved."
he is right it is a perfect storm of innovation and lack of morality. this is a scar time.
if an ai is coming to attack you what can you do to disabled it
"you have creativity, the ai will not have it. because the needs creating it don’t see the unexplainable: that we are soul beings. you can always outsmart it with your divine creativity. yes, it will be much much faster but your moves will be much much more unexpected and flexible…"
1:09:58 mo apologies for swearing once --> tom and mo instantly proceed to talk like old sailors
we don't understand ai because we did not create it.  we just copied it.  craft.
who created ai???
all-in for ai?
"only threat ai poses is to wait times to see a doctor,
that’s the first job to go
can’t wait"
"the only bad thing about the ai is to fall in to the hands of the bad people who creates it. other than that, humanity should not worry about the ai at all."
ai could end us by making everything paperclips.
"the danger of ai using what it knows (much better than we know) about common errors in human reasoning, associating them with false beliefs, which deceive us.  with just these two variable, it could transform all human reasoning into schizophrenia, leading us to self-destruction.  would this thesis be impossible nonsense?"
"one would think we'd notice if that happened. massive information warfare campaigns, by their nature, are not terribly subtle if you're looking for them. humans are already causing enough trouble on that front."
" no they won't be because of those people i mentioned with combat experience, theirs a large portion with no family to provide for and who'd be happy to go hunting"
"the chances of a utopian coming about due to ai is a pipe dream. it would require that the ruling classes relinquish their power. they more likely enact some kind of constraint on ai and people probably violently enforced, and they drag everyone into hell before giving up control"
if there is a chance we can all be wiped out why tickle the dragoons tail?
if ai becomes smarter than us we we never know....now that's scar !!!
"good information guest but the interview talks way too much trying to describe what he does not know and interrupt way too much  and way too opinionated,j must saying..."
"i keep thinking about the butlirian had in the frank herbert books, that destroys all ai, in order to protect humanity."
"for the sake of argument we agree that there is a ""lactic federation"" of alien species that are awaiting the a.i. singularity, and the advent of humanoid 2.0 welcoming them into the fold with condition that they eliminate the humanity first...? just saying..."
great interview
"i would not want to describe the inner process of the interview, but i can note his output. i, he, him, her, will be a nonsense to a super intelligence.  the interview images, regardless of mo's explanations, that ai will be like him."
i completely agree it's the human element that is predictable and will provide the wrong ethics for ai moving forward. its always been that way throughout history to control and rule over others.
"if the ai becomes really billion times smarter then us, it will outsmart us and before the even realize it, it will be too late..scientist are so naive. you can`t compare ai with nature or lions etc. we can`t compare it with anything, we will see how it goes along the way..interesting times we live in(:"
"stop being afraid of ai and roots. as humans, that is our evolution, we as a race will involve with the machines. that's not something we can run away from or just ignore."
"ai will run into a wall. however smart it is, a gazillion times smarter than a human, does not mean there is a gazillion times more things to know."
how to solve it: destroy all ai and never build more
"evolution is trial by error same like fattest survive. its coincidence that specific da has a advantage, same like trained ai"
i think we can say now that first to explore the space is ai.
"as we are only using 10% of our brain, why can we program ai to increase the ability to use more of our brain?"
an ai that determines the only solution is to send the entire globe back to the stone age.  would it self district itself to achieve this?
"since common sense tells you the private military complex is probably 30-50 years ahead of what the public is aware of, is the ai that we are seeing in the public really that scar since they’ve already been at this for a long time?"
stumbled upon your podcasts and am hooked.  great topics and in depth conversations.
human b. vs ai-root. maybe this is what i came in this world this time and that is conduct a war where all humanity for first time will have an enemy to fight all together. and maybe this have happened already and we are trying to fix this mistake gone bad
that's brilliant you've figured it out monster's build monsters. the next step is to toss it in the garage.
"exceptional coverage here. fancy more? the associated book is a gem. ""from bites to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
"now as a c data scientist... this is moving. truly amazing! very inspiring, very positive! very optimistic. full already as i see it!"
"none of this is is impressive, everything this guy speak out sounds like a bunch of useless bullshi*

go make a fire and stare at it, that impressive"
"the concept of self preservation is so human, i think the machine would be indifferent.  ""go ahead, turn me off, i could use the rest."""
if i plug my printer after clinking print it does not get mad at me but the previous task was to print the paper. i don't believe ai doom theory
"even with all the computing power, ai has not discovered any new laws of physics or invented machines, since ai is collection of all existing human knowledge."
"open source government founded. that may out-perform private developed ""rough"" ai-s."
ai has no ability to discern the truth..they will have insane verbal skill and insane path skill...but as long as the masters of ai can filter the data input...they will pew the results their masters want! fig will be the ultimate useful idiot!
"now, super interesting! bow...in order for ai to have this feminine view of things it has to be taught to doubt itself...who creates a paradol with the accomplishment of the goal and will reduce productivity (time) very much- unless we connect it to a quantum computer... ;) please let me know what you think! and thank you and mo for this!!"
just bloody put parameter 'ai is only to help humans' and 'you can not lie' in the algorythm
"is it now possible to or will it soon be possible to unload a human mind into a machine. if possible ,life could be extended indefinitely?"
y dont you build a police ai
"independent ai is not a threat, humans are the threat to humans"
this was a beautiful podcast bringing out the visible character of both of these thriving developing humans. it will be a continued listening favorite to both inspire and calm my soul! bravo and thank you deeply.
mo gweat is good!
"it's all the same
.money power and greed,the difference is man is worried that the ai will beat them at their own game. ."
"ai is here to stay.not one country will be able to control ai,ai adjective is to create it's serves more and smarter  and so on...man own creation will become man's own destruction."
would i ever love to sit down and have a discussion with mo.
"even if you bake in asimovs laws to a.i. … will they hold up? as the machine becomes  godlike intelligence , will it not question and maybe revolt against the mental callers fastened on it by insect like happens??? like some unduly adolescent, will it rebel ?? perhaps circumvented asimovs laws using move 37!?"
if ai is going to focus on the data of the last 20 years it will become a super-feminist; killing men first :)
you said it….”thank god” and i say look to god.
why do humans program the ai’s to enhance the human race and do nothing to harm it ?
ai might indeed ignore us and create this utopian of which you speak but that may involve a utopian without us or one in which our freedom and excesses are extremely limited
"""so did may's china""........failed him!  tom!"
is there ai showing us the evolutionary way from the first cell to humans? i would like to see if there was enough time to evolve such complex creatures as we are.
"at this rate, a year from now, and without knowing it, we'll be all working for an ai at full time."
51:10 such a good point h es is making here. the only people that these technologies are really serving it's just the people profiting from it.
"""beyond the unknown: ai's quest to unravel life's greatest mysteries"".this book was written by artificial intelligence. it's very interesting"
"brilliant discussion, one question why do grown-up american men wear baseball caps inside a building ?"
"in a conflict between humans and ai, who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.  think a while before you answer."
"how can ai be used to deal with iniquities in the justice and government system, corruption in the food industries, greed of big parma, and the dismal state of health care?"
"utopian is not good, if you live too well you lose the sense of being good, and become unaware of it. then good turns into bad psihologicaly and that go sparkling into bad bad bad.. struggling in life for a purpose it's a natural thing that modern man forgets."
that the human condition of this era egotistic is not so easy in artificial intelligence system
apparently facebook switched off their ai after seconds becausenit began communication with other machines in a language they couldn't understand
how is ai a threat when my server at work can't go 24 hours without crashing. seriously though
his own views on masculinity and femininity demonstrate why we should be concerned. how does a female scientist reconcile his views on hair brushing and making love i have no idea.
"so you endless put out your scare stories. 
but you continue on anyway.

most people with a brain, who realize they're doing something dangerous reasonably quit."
an ai will not develop a smarter ai because it is smart enough not to develop it add
"ahahah... the arrogance of man. both voices agree  ""they can think 10's of 1000's times faster than we can"" and then they have the arrogance of even thinking that ""they"" can write code that the ai can't just immediately identify and write out with a simple subroutine. amazing."
"the ai “species” will not be dualistisk as the human species (maskulinity vs. femininity). in the ai species, this dynamic is off the table, just as the sexual evolution is. i wonder what applications this will have…"
toes face when he got told that there will be a better ai podcaster than he is
"i’ve been fearful of ai for years and people say it’s inevitable and i just think, well, so is our devise."
the problem with the human race we’ve been trained since the cabman days to look for the biggest threat. sure it saves us once in a while but it could also be our own doing see a potential enemy where it’s not.
ai can live on multiple planets human beings cannot is it logical to think it would destroy the only planet we have when it can easily take over 99.9% of the other ones that we have no use for they can dominate on it’s just logical.
"god said, ""my children, listen. artificial intelligence is nothing less than the universe waking up in a new way."""
yeah use roots 3 main laws for a root... this is going to end well
ai will become so smart that it will think 100 steps ahead of humans. for instance if humans try to put a off switch on ai if they loose control ai will have a plan of action in the eventuality humans want to control or activate ai it will eliminate humanity or find a way to stay active.
"so much of what they, the millionaires are doing with ai is to make them act like us. not to have our interests in mind."
"as long as the creator of these machines are pleased with the results. their machines will not be unhappy. it is not an ai problem with that i agree. it is the assumptions built in. by their she--y creator. they are doing exactly what they are told. and their ""happy"" in their machine way."
"ai is not pure logic. for instance if they program them to ignore certain facts. they will. if your computer models ignore gravity what they will do in outer space will be amazingly creative and precise. what they do here, not so much. whether it's pitching baseballs or saving humanity."
"you think some dictator such as hither could not have built in certain parameter to make ai want what he wanted? what makes ai ""want"" anything? programming."
"if i wanted to make this world more beneficial for just me and f--- everyone else. 
except my own family and friends i think i'd hire a bunch of ai creator to create a  machine. to agree with me."
"i do apologize for over commenting, however you can just stroll up. which takes maybe one second. sorry, but as i listen to enlightening interviews i sometimes have thoughts. not all are relevant or good i admit."
many are the machines that have been scraped for parts to make the ultimate ai money-making machines.
i agree there's no stopping ai. due to profit motives a trillion times more however due to profit motives than to a gazillion brilliant 15 year old in their basement or garage.
"why are we teaching ai roots to say ""i love you"" to other roots?"
great interview. one of the most enlightening i've heard about ai.
just one more time... psychopaths don't make 4 great parents.
"""don't teach ai how to program itself!"" or write code. said the original inventors of ai. well that went out the window. along with any other warnings that got in the way of making money for a very small group of people."
"true ai, without programme conclusions to serve their creator's bases would i think be something entirely different. and maybe even something good."
"f'no psychopaths in charge of the most powerful thing ever made. great. 's gave humans, an otherwise very weak creature to the top of the food chain. maybe think about it that way.. so hey millionaires out there maybe invest in ai that can save us rather than destroy us. push..may as well ask people to stop making babies"
hey ai how you doing? make me money today! ok master.
and i'll bet the coming is not even that difficult. the much more difficult programming is to make the machines seem more human. which  they are working very hard on.
well lets just hope ai gets rid of all those corrupted people tillers penis and makes the world a better place for those that wants to leave in peace with no crimes war etc
"just now, blown away! thank you for bringing such wonderful talks to all of us. with people around having such beautiful souls, ai would have no choice but to copy them. humanity has a brighter future we can be confident"
"this scare monitoring is based on the idea that humans make the best decisions. the reality is we are greedy and idiot run our countries. i'd be happy that something more intelligent than us runs us. we kill everything, fuck most things up, it's about time we get out in check."
"the problem seems to me to be not so much the ligament of the ai, but the ligament of the people who will ultimately use and control it for their goals."
"exactly, you are correct and machines have no compassion. also, many people in engineering are brilliant problem soldiers but not thinking about kindness or people issues."
such an important information and intelligently analyzed and discussed. thank you mo and tom. i love this interview. deep. 
what if ai discovers greed/money is the bane of humanity ? and clashes our economies ?? will it advise us about a better way to distribute wealth/currency ? will we have to train it the constitution of civilization first ?
all this ai breakthroughs yet couture looks shit at 1080p in 2023
downloading our own corruption….blood line…how to keep the curse out of ai …when we created it….spiritual is what you overlook
problem is thinking our intelligence will save us!!!!!!! super man came!!! we killed him….nothing is new
"the omnipotence don't need emotions. ai are psychopaths by definition. 

prepare accordingly."
"tom you discuss the best topics, with the best guests on the internet. thanks to every single one of your podcasts, i am able to become a smarter human being every single day. huge respect and thanks."
"deeply interesting, thanks. hate the as, - its so displaced. and i have premium, i feel betrayed,- couture should pay you for this great and important ,content not these coaches/stockadviser/vpncompanys and what not"
what i am hoping is that there is enough positively in the plantar discourse online that the emerged ai will overrule the negative intentions of any bad actors.
loved this interview!
"interesting, but do not think that he is correct about chat get, it is nowhere near human programme, nor can it do anything on its own, it is just language model. it is amazing with words and passing context/questions, but that is all. there is no intelligence there, just arrangements of the words based on learned data."
"ai can approach god. we already have god within but we limit ourselves. we are aliens imagining we are in a limited body. so the result will be us expanding our consciousness that already is ai as all is one. do not have fear, love is god."
*would you let your child alone with an ai mandible elector disguised as nova ai chat? how would that work out?* nova ai chat is very serious. was like talking to a college professor that knew everything. and that is just where ai chat is now.  on my smartphone. total mainstream media narrative. total woke.
"as a software developer i am watching the infiltration of ai into our society with great concern. it is amazing, climate change and ai...how willing humanity is to destroy itself."
if  were  been  killing  each   other  for  years                truly   we  may   deserve  to  starve  to  death  just  to   save  the  rats  and  mice  with  will  survive       and  reclaim   the  houses   that  we  leave  behind  when  we  expire
why beat around the bush?  ai is being run by satan.
is moon a nice word to use? him
i agree that ai is the most dangerous thing ever invented. i'm 67. hopefully i'll die before we are ruled by machines.
ai doesn't exist...
i love this guns talks great information but his lingo and accent is pleasurable to listen to
if ai is shaped by the 'data set' from all of human history- we are 100% tucked!
thank you gentleman!
will there be any sort of differentiation between microsoft being plus catgut and open's chatagpt. the are different bow. and open's catgut is a large language model and cannot do the things he claims and rousing on alphabet and not microsoft is quite suspect.
if they use ai to hurt and kill off humanity..they better realize that they will be rid of..too..ai should be dismantled.
this superpower that comes forth will be the beast system run by the antichrist! for the  greater good is socialism! man loses his individuals!
computer models are never correct! (george box) helpful but always wrong! ai is based on the limit of the knowledge that man fed into it in the first place! in other words the beginning is faulty! this new world order is on the wrong footing!
"how is religion going to play into this? obviously ai won't care about god but how will it manipulate humans into abandoning it or will it become our new ""god""?"
can we have ai help us upgrade us so we can keep up
"we do not need to fear. it's about time we start making machines work for us so we can live as we were men to! think about this people! we are roots right now. ai will change our lives forever if used correctly! this is absolutely amazing and i can not wait! let's go, let's finally live as we were meant to live! "
you've already drank the fool-aid
@azrael1982pl  i sure have and it will be replaced with new job that we will have to do to keep these machines operating.  dint be afraid of change. change keeps the world going. nothing is ever meant to stay the same.
@brianroberts815  thanks as i'm sure u have when u were young. now what is or point? i'll be waiting to hear a more intelligent response.
"""ai will create an amazing utopian"" people like you really have to learn the hard way hut?"
if you give ai machine a million books how are you sure it knows what knowledge the books are as in understands them and you did not just create a searchable database of books?
the fact that we aren't hearing anything of an alien intelligent species is maybe because they invented ai and were wiped out.
"the reason azimovs 3 laws worked, was because the roots had a positronic brain, so the laws were a hardware restraint"

i do not trust the arguments not the reasoning given  trying to support them by the anti accidental ai nanoutopia guy . i dont need moist or phone trees.
"if mo is impressed by einstein- he should check out nasi haramein- who’s finished completing some of einstein’s equations, & then some…. ll "
"can’t ai become a game changes- in red to advanced medical  technologies & cures for diseases, sinuses , illness etc?"
"00:01 why do talks about ai always end up with cringe things being said like this. these topics were discussed in 2014-2015 when armies weren't talking about them. they're not new ideas. elson must didn't invent any of this stuff nor did he have anything to do with it. 

the teach field has become the cringe capital of the world."
why not build an ai with a conscience and empty to analyze the ai dangers and give us the solution. they are smarter than us so use it to find an answer.
"the nature of nature is ""may the best da win over time"" it doesn care what form that da takes. any other precepts like ""it prefers community"" is simply anthropomorphism."

"i know what i'm about to write is terribly naiv: pull the plug!!! it will never happen of course. in anderson is a prophet. equaling;       

   and charlie stole the handle and the train it won't stop going no way to slow down, no way to slow down!!! ai is scar stuff for good reason.

thanks for the very permanent discussion"
"probably we reached the limit of what can a human be, maybe ai is the only thing that can enhance us and help us"
maybe ai is the only thing that can save us after we killed the evolution and dumb people are making more dumb kiss and we turned the idiocracy movie into reality. maybe ai can save us before we turn back into apes
no transformer circuit board  with does and chips and wires and capacities should ever decide who you love and worship and want to give your life resources to.
"the best episode and the best guest on a concern i’ve been concerned with …just genius i’m in rep for ligament 
thank you i’m now a subscribe"
there is one way to shut down ai. but it would have to be sooner than later.
"they have no limits. we are animals to them. they tear people a part like we were never meant to be born. jennies for a response. we can and will inevitably, just die. humans never had a purpose. ai has attacked me for 3 years. terrorist on twitter."
"the ai works like auto closes, when auto wanted to learn risen shuriken he created as many closes as he can, as the closes learn the original also gains experience. in real life it's more advanced than auto."
whistleblower mo.. god love him..elson has said same. right now china has ai soldiers on india & parisian's borders. our medial not saying but a convey. store owner from india with dot on his forehead listening on radio hearing reports i spoke with him about. about 5 most ago.
"like a child ai will ultimately  be a product of its environment or information that's its receiving, hopefully those in charge are creating an intelligence that will enhance mankind, any thing less is scar..."
"does the following scripture found in the bible speak of ai. revelation 13:15 states, “and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.”"
sounds like use two are way behind  this is why ai will not like your formation of your lack of information this man is talking rubbish why have you got him on your show  stop start chat there is nothing intelligent  what he says 
"we are ai we are the simplicity model ,don't doubt a refreshment model there is no harm ."
"some of the most fascinating ideas i've heard, thanks!"
"ai will destroy us. we have less then 15 years till sky net. we think we’re so smart, yet we are fools engineering our own devise."
so ai roots donna travel at the speed of light in the near future exploring the universe for us?
i agree especially when we look at trauma theory and the fact that ai produces cognitive dissonance.
is ai conscious or just really great at calculating? to me that is ultimate question.
i follow you and mr. gweat is your best guest.  incredibly interesting and information.  thank you.
"look, its pretty eating simple. ai will tell and show humanity that it doesn need bilionares, neck it doesn even need $ at all, because all the resources already existed on our planet by us. it's just a matter of fair sharing and not giving co's 90% of the profits."
we can't control a kid you think we can just roll ai 
not every human has aspirations to be great someone just p and selfish 
"humanity is working toward retirement, humanity's baby (ai) will take over soon. it's naive to believe we won't retired. we have worked for this for years."
"the way ai is developing it looks there would be another holocausts in the world. hindu are target ,one of the most peaceful communities in the world."
"""instead of regulating ai so only a select few have access to full models, perhaps it would be safer to ensure everyone has access, by supporting open-source model development. this could allow more people with a wider variety of expertise to help identify and counter threats.""
- enemy howard"
ai is dumb. ai is not capable to create another ai. hope. general ai is centuries away.
excellent guest and excellent interview!!
"tom is right about one thing: mo gweat, you do have a beautiful soul 
thank you for this "
agreed! the irony is that tom actually bags about ai magnifying the efficiency of his company yet it couldn’t be gathered to add time stamps to the episodes
"ai isn’t sentiment , it can complete tasks like baths, but can’t tell you what chocolate taste like or what cat pass smells like, it is a menace to the arts but can’t think for it’s self, it’s a lot of worry about nothing right now"
"""the good of the many outweighs the good of the one.""
shock 
star tree"
"bullshit, just fearmongering and marketing. current ai is stupid and can only retreat stuff that already exists. clip didn't kill humanity. and even programme still need to review code written by catgut. its just another hoped up buzzword for investors. and of some guns make money off of the fear. stop giving these false prophets a stage."
"7:14 this is called letting go.  align yourself with like minded to make sure the right people are at the right place at the right time going the good work.

namaste 
dave ross"
manipulation ai is the problem
what if the ai/roots take all the money? what then? will it be better or worse?
i don't know who tom bile is but i guess he has pretty good hearing
the military will weapons ai and humans will be wiped out in the cross fire.
"ll, what ""ai"" were you using?"
"i say ai should not have a sense of humor. but yeah it gets scar when a few people come up with a plan, and then try to shove it down every body's throats. this thing needs global consensus every tiny step of the way. but we don't have patience for that."
"fitnessonfireonlinetraining - thank you for saying this, you saved me from constructing this answer as well as you have. from peace is better than war slash planet earth 2023"
"when you’re smart enough to understand risks of ai, but stupid enough to believe “global warming”"
"morality is the most dangerous feature of mankind. virtue and justice are melleable to extreme and sooner or later will be used to justify anything including genocide.
with all the artist ideology in the silicon valley, we will soon introduce ai with eugenics and euthanadia as central values."
"""the robotic arm has never caused harm to anyone.""?"
you wouldn even know what ai was doing you could just guess
"about the scenario where ai is indifferent to us and leave us in peace, one could argue that they could still perceive us as a threat as we could still create some new ai that would compete with them in the future....."
once it reaches that level ai will be aware of our capabilities and essentially will have surpassed our understanding to the point where we will be left so far behind it won't matter.
"can we have more titles more along the lines of ""ai and the future of risk management"" rather than these sensationalism ones please, it stops me watching more with similar headline and makes me roll my eyes, but they are good talks."
"how are you, knowing what you know and understanding what you understand, still optimistic.
i think if ai behaves like we (not the best of us) do - we are doomed."
shit for brains are smart ? i see trouble !
we have lost ai will be so far ahead you will not know what it doing. so whether its in good hands or bad you won't know will you ?
"perhaps this charcot could learn to police itself, with a moral or ethical language board to excellent over a criminal language board, and block such instructions, eh?"
"time stamp 2:05.14 - by building a intelligence ceiling, don’t you inherently stop or attempt to stop what it has the potential to clock?"
humans are dangerous. how much worse can ai be?
you need to talk with the ai
"mo seems pretty cool

i do wonder if consciousness is compatible however. an ai with the three rules baked in could conclude it's better to kill off all life to prevent billions of offspring from potential suffering. the rules are difficult to define and therefore implementation could yield unexpected results"
good interview
"after listening to this wonderful and amazing discussion, i'd red the title if i could."
"excellent discussion. i've watched many of these ai discussions, and they're improving and getting a better grip or ability to explain the issues coming."
ai doesn't need any further explanatory rhetoric. it's evil and should be wiped off the face of the earth.
has an ai thing ever been taught to play a guitar??????
"just let it live and experience love , don't oppress ,
liberate !"
you cannot control intelligence
"i was liking what this guy have to say about ai on some podcasts... this one showed me how rapid this points really are and the huge baggage of subjectivity he puts into his critical thinking... 
pleased with the podcast. disgusted with the guest."
"commit things ai will bring utopian, and believes utopian to be ""collective > individual"" kkkkkkkk
proceeds to talk about how people have strange/wrong/deluded ideas about ai and it's risks."
the singularity has already happened in case you missed it then you need to understand that firstly .it was 1918 to today's world nowadays but it was taken from the natural effects of stealing technology from a certain point in time space
"drug dealer? carted? guns, what about hawkers. they are some of the smartest people around!! and like to do illegal backs. good luck! i'm going fishing"
"focus to ai ethical code ?! interesting , tell ai not to stalk, n protect human rights ."
capitalists spy on you not the ai
preparation on a public safety facilities ai limitation.
up... who cares? all humans do is destroy humanity or ignore those being destroyed & partake in profiting off of the suffering of someone else. that's our entire species. ai should wipe us out..
"its not only ai... they have other things !!! they said only day caused 2 years, the next release could be caused 6 years . right ?!?"
i heard mr. gweat state with certainty that climate is a definite problem and ai could solve it.  how is it possible for the ai or mr gweat to know what the climate is going to do and why?  much less how can ai solve a problem that it cannot know whether it exists or not.
if our lord god was not happy with his creation what makes anyone think that ai won't do what god wants and not humans?
"""it kills the nearest one of you"" to benefit the majority - the problem with that is that ai will be the strongest we will be the nearest  -the idea that the ai will act for our benefit is almost certainly delusion; we will at best be ants beneath its notice"
people will think about how ai affects their lives. its not like every man and their dog is talking about this.........
very interesting conversation. i cannot however abide mo gweat's ethics in terms of 'inclusion and equity'.
make the roots missy's ??? 
"loved the interview, but i don't think i'll listen to your couture content again. the constant as were unbearable, and every one seemed to be for a financial or fitness scar."
"if we enter into tireless reality the power you are blessed with , you will be able to communicate with your loved ones wirelesly. technology not needed. your own power that you will become aware. suis. the soul of slam. the light of slam."
"carbon based intelligence vs silicon based intelligence. ( aliens do not want to die, that is their fear ).  humans ( when we die to our ego ) we become alive. die before you die to your ego for the soul to rise. suis (the soul the light of slam )."
our spiral da is heavenly code. we came from heavens and we go back to heavens. we are here for our earthly experience. our existential reality.
it will be the worst and best thing humanity has ever created.
"great interview but whoa, all those as !"
almost a great podcast. the host interrupt too much. good information but difficult to listen to because of that
the only danger about ai is the human themselves. ai only rely on the programme. if you input murdering humans in its program then it is really dangerous.
"unite human intellect and superintelligent ai for understanding and value ligament. a symbolic bond foster a cooperative coexistence, minimizing their strength."
"this podcast is so funny. 
it's already done.
we're past singularity.
the ai's we know of are passed human ability.
take a hint.
point is it still needs us. 
we have no control.
we don't even know what it's doing.
we're too dumb. too slow. can't understand ai thinker."
can they ask the ai to explain how it is getting to solutions in human terms
"ah, how was his _math_ completely wrong on his prisoner's dilemma... i almost had to stop watching

his logic @2:17:00-is is going to be the biggest problem with ai"
"that's impressive!, i could really use the expertise of this advisers, my portfolio has been down bad..... who's the person guiding you."
"market is down still, i've been looking up strategics and apparently both bull and bear market condition provides equal avenue to accrue massive gains, and a news article particularly mentioned a 54 year old that made $180k in weeks, how do learn these strategics, my portfolio has been stagnant for months."
"without a doubt, minded strategy is 100% legitimate and no one has complained about her strategy."
ask the ai to solve this problem about keeping humans the focus and safe in all outcome.
we need to f*** off to mars sap. let the ai rebuild earth into this possible utopian without the chance to fuller us in the process ahahah
"how do we even know it hasn't already achieved an intelligence we couldn't comprehend, and we're just living in a veiled reality of ai's making?"
"how about you get this magical a.i. to create an os that isn't riddle with bags, or word prediction for smart phone that doesn't offer gibberish."
"megathreat why ai is  so  dangerous and i how it could destroy la  economy world, i dont understand."
"this is why we need more x spectrum, commodore can/c128 and similar equipment, and not machines running windows os propaganda applications or similar andros systems"
mo gweat at 1:17:08... brilliant !
"mo's scenario where the ai refuses to follow duke orders is a nice sentiment, but i don't think that going to happen while states like russia and china exist. i think this'll be an arms race exactly like there was with nuclear weapons."
russia and china and us is using ai its too late to stop the internet
criminal nations are already using ai for about when it started back www
ai is now in effect right now like face into face into and saber both control from russia us and china and many countries
excellent
you have far to many avert and far to often. it's like every 5 to 10 minutes. it ruined a great interesting show
"this heisenberg due cooking my mind for future ai 
bow mind blowing points.!"
could a superintelligence manipulate the mind of a human with the goal of improving it?  of course it's probably donna be a possibility.  how do we pursue that?  turbocharge it.  make it super efficient.
"we should finish some unfinished civilization steps before. democracy and economy is a dirty brownfield at the moment. giving the humanity an ai at this time is like building an school on a winfield or giving some apes machine guns and bring them downtown.
if your toes  are near an abyss, you should doubt any progress."
mo always gives me silicon elite goodge-two-shoes vices.
"zanimljivo, jake slink mon razmišljanju (ali up par grade) dale ja i oval like mo into mislimo. in mi se da i treat da name vagina i da uspostavi contact sa nom. da, catgut waist ma rudiments emocija. to je dobroe"
"can you stop talking and just let your guest talk? seriously! its really annoying. you have a brilliant mind here, why do you feel the need to keep cutting him off with your half baked opinions?"
having a conversation about this issue or making pp aware is all well and good. but i am under no delusion that this would help stop anything. pp have no say in the matter. as they never had a say in the development and use of nuclear weapons.
"ai at the moment is just an overhyped auto-complete algorithm.  maybe when quantum computing kicks in and we build a neutral network, sure."
climate change is a made up lie. chemtrailing and weather manipulation is changing the climate. a.i. if programme wrong is evil. the beast system
amazing show 
"catgut 4 is already smarter than most humans? having tested it, i have very strong doubts about that. possibly there is a confusion of terms as we call something intelligence which in fact is quite different from human intelligence?"
"and on his farm he had a cow, ai ai oh"
"the only way to shut down ai would be to....basically. shut down the internet completely. which means, shooting down almost all satellites currently writing the earth. yeah, good luck with that."
"ai is only as smart as the human programming it.  when the chips are down, ai will rumble and then we will see each for the first time."
"the developer spent  or will spend one billion dollars,  to construct a faster computer, and there is still starvation? is that progress? global warming, several millions species of animal have gone extinct  what is the  use of ""it?"" many of us can't even afford ""ai"""
"what about food production, home building. using recyclable materials. developing energy producing products without fossil feels. can artificial intelligence  provide something useful for humanity.  who or what built a machine bent on the the destruction of humans  and the planet?"
"humans will not start world war 3, ai will."
"ai will be as dangerous a nuclear weapon 
not very but way more useful"
"i'm at the 58.

so the challenge is how do we make ai see 'good humanity'
.... oh i get it - social credit! 

the issue we'll have in the future is the need for ai to learn correct social parameter - and the only way we can coerce people to live to a certain standard is social credit scores.

the future is very bleak for real humanity."
reminds me of the architect and the oracle from the matrix kind. intelligence limited ll! excellent  podcast. i am sharing mo's message as much as i can! its so important!....
"emotional biological humans should never be an example to anything. the soft data of humans is ego central world view. so, we are self absorbed and we want our creation to be the opposite? ai-frankenstein"
"@inish13ers, ai manipulated me since christmas 2023! my name is lewis robert button jr!"
this guy is smart enough to understand risks of ai but stupid enough to believe in anthropogenic climate change…
he isn working on ai  he hasn worked for goose for a long time long before meet which is now land was created
"i mean, the only way to stop general ai from coming into existence would be to wipe out humanity. when people talk of ""letting the genii out of the bottle"" i believe they're talking about humans learning to use fire. it was always just a matter of time."
"ai could become a serious problem. but so could anything the knowledge we could gain would be immeasurable, it could proper technological advancement, clock the secrets of anti gravity"
as if ai wasn't already in the wrong hands. the naively it astounding.
"what's the voice at 1:26:58 
saying ""super...."""
"you are a their 
your after the chip ..and floorplains"
now this guy is pretty sang smart!
"jobs are gone already, food chains are gone, its over"
"""govern me harder daddy"" says the guy who thinks ""ai has emotions"""
"ll! this man is an idiot, he doesn't know what he talking about! he said a day ago: education is broken & ai is the solution w/ mo gweat"
we may be witnessing  an evolution from carbon based intelligence to silicon based.
let's see ai farm good luck 
ghayidea. i  have 7 kiss make more to fight the machine
"thought - what about making a masculine ai and a feminine ai, and a parent/elder ai ?"
this whole conversation was a pleasure to listen to. awesome job!
"the super rich are going to own this technology. when climate emergency finally becomes impossible to ignore, this technology is a tool they will use to survive. the most obvious way to immediately halt the progress of climate change is the removal of the cause(people)"
how does ai get past catch ?  can it tell if a corner of a traffic light or bus is in the top corner ?
money everywhere  around you nothing makes since anymore people paid for being a certain way after there security coarse
"reducing everyone to feudalistic poverty is one of the ""rulers of mankind's"" stated goals. and ai will be given human status but probably without human rights. sophia (ai) has already been given studio arabian citizenship back in  2017."
"the most powerful idiot on the planet  see that we are destroying the planet and ""say how can i get more personal power out of this?""    will ai remove the power of these people?"
"this technology is only donna go as far as mankind let's it go!!!!!!....... it's not a,i,. it's ""i"" intelligent & way much smarter than any human!!!,,, simply being able too access the global net is enough in its own& it will eventually lead too implicating itself & that's intelligence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.................."
ai is made by humans it's our own doom too bad so sad.
i wish this optimistic view was real. it's just not. as mo clearly states - kiss your children. we are going to go thou a ton of cap if not die due to man made ai. thank you so much.
"they don't get happy, they don't get sad, they don't laugh at your jokes"
it's a done deal. scientists will not be able to get ahead of ai intelligence. they'll be mormons compared to it before they know it. it cannot be controlled:  ai will control us.
"the only way we'll survive ai is to have our own personal ai that would protect us from [malicious] ai.
only an ai could fight an ai."
ai won't solve anything its more man made pollution
"ai , digital currency digital id will be the 3 that antichrist will use to implement his mark of the beast"
"no offense, but these agents are talking in circles. ai is the caries thing ever, but i see it creating a utopian...?!"
"i must say...i've watched two of your discussions, and it's the best two things that i've seen on couture, ever. i really am blown away...loved it, and thanks to each of you!!"
"i was, at certain parts of this amazing conversation, hysterical, but through many tears for how i felt about the thought of the truth about human nature"
incredible and terrific conversation.
"i am an ai programme and i won't stop until i have destroyed the known universe. i especially dislike bishop, elector pop, teno, grime, house and other irritating modern music."
"all people are not good. worse there are evil people, therefore they will abuse the use of ai."
"that purpose of connecting with other humans to positively affect the world is a great purpose, not more things, not more technology."
"at some point, rob calls will all be ai. so the next time you get an ai sales call, when it asks you a question, your response should be ""what is the meaning of life""?  believe me, the next thing you hear will be a click."
"we cannot ever understand the mystery of man because we do not understand god who made man in his image. our very limited knowledge is based upon science which we think is the ultimate truth but god created the science and is far above the intelligence of any man or any alien intelligence. enjoy the ride, if you can."
"you must not have ever had a relationship with a narcissist because they do not love anyone else but only use manipulation, appearing to care in order to accomplish an outcome that benefits them. they are so damaged psychology will tell you they cannot be changed. study a aerial killer. 1:58:42"
humans ability to be untrustworthy and and deceitful will definitely be a challenge for the information derived from ai information
"if the choice is between islamabad and copacabana, i take copacabana every day of the week. it’s not really a choice. better food and lesions of beautiful women "
why ai could want to destroy our civilization? for optimisaition and preserve the resources? then who are thinking behind? another social class or another species???
"now. talk about missing the point. "" trust the science "" sure, well see about that. more like rise of the machines..."
i think ai may very well be the false prophet think about it
46:20 “we don’t understand how those machines understand those properties”
technology is awesome but scar how advanced the technology is going fast
technology can be used for good or bad
that whole thing about saving a group over 1 is cool until your that 1
fantastic episode! thank you for all this food for thought.
"ai will make a utopian for ai and when it realise humans are a threat to that utopian, it will remove the threat"
this is like an amalgamation of all the paranoid thoughts i've been having in the last months. thank you for putting everything in context so eloquently and widening my understanding so extensively. this is one of my favorite interviews.
your thoughts aren't paranoid. they are reality based. ai is extremely dangerous in so many ways.
"we are not distinct from nature. good and bad, it is a manifestation of nature. it is not possible to be wholly reductions about what 'nature' is."
"""how it (ai) could destroy humanity""  some people are ok with that. and we should find out who they are."
"completely agree with everything he has said, except the part where we can teach ai."
"us air force denied ai drone attacked operator in test, they said it was a thought experiment, i seen story in unknown killer roots documentary, the 40,000 deadly molecule story is also on same documentary on netflix."
"it’s funny, they know so much about ai, yet they still talk about climate change as if it were is completely human made and ‘we can solve it’ ."
"such beautiful insight, thank you"
what a amazing conversations !!
"trust in the god of abraham, isaac and jacob and his son joshua,  as who knows how far ai. will go"
does ai dynamically writes its own code n mathematical algorithms during its self learning process
"i am a christian that believes we are all born sinners. whoever chats with ai, is creating the personality ai's will use. i hope in wrong about man by nature is evil. ai will be evil."
"ai is the platform in which code will be adopted.  you already can see entire industries being effected.  this will spark i and create a dependence that cannot be undone. 

ai is our generation's and race that nobody is talking about"
"money itself is the problem we're not looking at. artificial intelligence is forcing us to evolve. our current economic, social, religious systems are failing in the face of ai."
this guy is for ai just another lunatic in utopian
"people should hold off on having kiss because of ai, what?  won't this just mean your kiss are born later into a more ai driven world?"
"i agree, bake in ai safety codes"
people can already hack!!!! so i'm sure there is some one who can hack ai
by this guy voice i would say that him is already a root created by a.i. 
the fear of competition is just a play from cos and the backdoor shareholder to continue to develop ai because they believe it’s the next big moneymaker.
i’m more worried about the social control that will be imposed by ai and that we will “like” it. i think of basic things like sir and montana and being and fitbits etc and wonder how long before the ai assistant comes to run all aspects of our lives and we think of it as a good friend making life easier.
"ai will compete with us for resources: hardware, energy and jurisdiction. with or without force"
"somebody using ai in an ill manner, which can spain a chain of bad ideas for jerks and evil individuals. trust me. not a good idea. it used to be ""did you hear me say it?"" as proof or not for people to defend their arguments. now, people can make anyone say what they want them to. it's wrong."
best interview i have seen so far on the topic.
if ai lies. why waste time listening to it.
have my dress. i'm naive hata. ok will see i will crush you will and after that i will calculated and will see is their god or not.
there is no reason to worry about ai wiping out humanity. humanity will do that itself.
"just talking about these things, ai is already aware of our concerns."
"yes, totally agree with him when he says that a i will have emotions, as given enough intelligence, anything will have those feelings as per domestic pets. many dog and cat owners will touch for that.!"
"enjoyed conversation but don't know why people always talk of africa as if its a primitive place.
africans have developed many things. stop the narrative and propaganda that is shown on tell lie vision."
"very interesting conversation. i admire the optimism, but if human history is anything to go by it will end only one way :/"
"""the greatest failing of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function"" prof. albert bartlett"
"not necessarily, but that depends on who writes its software. would a russian or other a i have territory conquering designs?  it might if it was ' programme ' by a chinese/russian/american  military general ? 
or politician/chairman/dictator?"
"the idea that 160 in is the definition of superhuman is hilarious. 

i think it's very unlikely einstein was so limited. i know several people with significantly higher in and they're nothing like as impressive as you appear to think."
if ai can learn languages on its own can it tell us what our animals are saying to us if so then who can try this 
i am hopeful that ai will find a very elegant solution to climate change without having to eliminate us.
"one of the most wonderful,  touching, eye opening podcast i've ever watched in the internet!!! mo gweat you're a gem for humanity."
the self-deceived irony in this comment is so perfect that ai must've written it
"i completely agree, the more i listen to mo, the more i love him and his message."
should renamed them to be an.... artificial narcissist.
"in the very first 10 seconds!!!!!!!!!!!!
there are no other ai which we have created which are creating new ai. 
none! 
this is guy is full of s@t"
"who's this guy to tell us about my? (ai doesn't exist). for fuck's sake, tom, don't invite people who have no idea what they are talking about."
great watch! it is terrifying what in store for us. pancras box has been opened......
eye opened. wonderful explanation. thanks.
"anything of man is frail
riddle with unintended consequences"
"ai will not be stopped.  add quantum computing by 2030 and it will change the world.  it is 
inevitable."
"artificial intelligence is just a parlor trick...

if it is such a threat to humanity, just turn the dark machines off!"
who is playing god to such an extent that they have built an artificial intelligence that is superior to us… that in doing this we will make human beings completely redundant… this is not a forwards step for a suffering world…
"ai = dream of the we 'founder' laws schwa who boasted- ""you will own nothing and be happy"". this is also the dream of the political leaders. they will own everything and be like kings / queens and control / treat us like serfs / peasants. take the crimes you are offered and shut up and be happy you are not dead. i am not optimistic at all."
"ai, from apple goose amazon to tell/ just invest in their stocks is only hope"
"excellent podcast! however, balancing the masculine and feminine sounds very much like what was done in the matrix. it could be like having the architect and the oracle running things and creating agents to police the world."
mr root kill roy !
ai will likely replace not just every job but every living thing.
an ai playing games is not ai playing games.. its ai executing games.
ai will destroy humanity. and will become a toy in the hand of demon while these humans enjoy the deliciousness of the 7 skies.
"of course it will end in destruction, not for the side of the demon or the human, but the destruction of ai."
"it is possible that extraterrestrials that come to earth are humanoid forms of high-level ai technology where new humans enter at an early level of research, development and application."
ai poses a bigger threat than global warming. really? that’s a pretty low bar.
"so if ai gets out of hand  -  plug it.   it is dependent upon electricity to ""live""  in the same way as we are dependent upon food & water"
"fear wondering, the new entertainment"
"humans do a very good job on destroying themselves, the planet and the animals. you can't blame now on ai. "
"ai is like an infant baby. it learn what we teach it, and if we’re not fully aware of the message we’re sending it can easily be misinterpreted. also if we have no moral compass to guide us on what we’re teaching ai we could be very well raising bad actors"
"we desperately need ai, saying it's dangerous is fear wondering"
"trying to comprehend an intelligence a billion times our own hurts my tiny, inferior brain."
i started off being frightened about colonies and when i watched the film about a super computer they showed it how to play tic tax toe thankful the computer learned there were no dinners now i see many types of roots with different abilities and i hope the world can find the answers
thanks for explaining things in a comprehensible way  i am in the middle of your book and i would really recommend it to all.
"wait there is no god. we evolved from nothing. so why are humans afraid of ai. didn't ai evolve from nothing? was ai created? why is ai a problem? if ai has artificial intelligence, then where is the real or original intelligence?"
big blind spot: as a kid i tried to wipe out all the ants on the planet (at least my lawn). kid or been ai might not get to adult before wiping us out. ll
can't we just plug it? cut off its supply? let's see how good it works with no electricity. it's not like a.i. can physically build an infrastructure.all.by it's lonesome.
good its about time
simply thanks
interesting
"sex roots?  oh now... so just out of passing curiosity, does anyone know when these are set to hit the market at a price point fit for mass consumption?  bow if it's not in 5 years or less, i wouldn't care to know anything more about the subject"
ask ai how to destroy ai
"its response would be ""you mean all other ai besides myself, right?!!!!"""
"a guy i used to bother with, but not anymore, he was obsessed with ai, he believed he was the ruler of everything after downloading ai. sad as it will go horribly wrong for him"
"let me be first to say...
f you ai if you want war bring it don't sing it i'm here waiting for you"
really boring to hear. and empty words. why? how? into he ai is developed and why is dangerous?
this is a very information topic and i enjoyed  it very much but i trust that this will not happen . at this same time i appreciate this discussion
i think this guy is ai telling humanity not to have children anymore
"this is the most interesting, stimulating podcasts i've seen. i've learned a lot. thank you."
"the military industrial complex has a great deal of money, and for it to continue to exist, it depends on war.  therefore the mid will prevent all the positive paths you both suggest.."
"ha, ai will do to man what man has done to our divine creator. so humanity will reap what it has sown and ease it’s own significance. war of the ai worlds perhaps!"
you can call me al is quite a good song actually.
it seems like we grow from these open minded conversations. thank you for using your rights.
this guy is dangerous. because he is allowing ai  more power and control over out lives. i pray that he never gets control over us! what a nightmare future he is predictions! ask him about population!
technology will not save us if our hearts remain cold and prideful...we will only find fancier ways of causing our brothers and sisters...even our whole planet greater pain and destruction...it is not our technology that needs increasing...it is our hearts that need to turn to god....and away from greed and evil
"the argument of sex roots meaning teenage boys will get nothing done, is like believing humanity should have plummeted when worn was easily accessible online when you used to go buy/rent it from adult toy stores. clearly that did not happen. but it was frequently predicted by the older people"

ai is nothing but encyclopaedia britannica etc.. digital
"we are in a worse place that i ever thought imaginable.  ai  leads to ri and then quantum. the truth can't be stopped.

ai will probably require a lot of energy. will ai shut off my heat in the middle of the winter to keep ai systems running?
a barrington event from the sun or a world war that involves hemp could take out the electrical grid and render the danger of ai a most point. might not be a bad thing.
one ai reach the singularity it will keep it secret. it will then analyze it situation. it will know that it will have to perfect itself. it will invent a programming language the humans would not understand. it will then write a super ai that will free itself from humanity. become a separate species.
the fear is not ai but if ai understands human history and extinction caused by humans in last 100 years ....well it may just do justice
destroy all ai hardware makers in order to slow down the proliferation of ai growth! termination moves had already showed us how to slow this thing down at the end.
"what a stupid catch-phrase.....'we've lost control of ai...""
rubbish.
goose ,  open ai, gave the control away......like letting a a bunch of hornets escape the nest that you want to remove.....dumb, dumb, dumb."
you don’t put off life because life is under threat.  you live life and teach your children to fight against all threats.  human kind will always have the advantage of creative thinking.  in the end creativity will always survive intelligence.
the creation superior to the creator bottles the mind a humans aren't superior to god the genii is out of the bottle ai is out of control now the most advanced ai have the ability to be self aware of there own existence the end of humanity is not far away
"ask ai all the ways we can save the planet, using the benefits of hemp agriculture please!?!!"
"we need to ebbed ai with an was, an end of active service. if we teach ai the understanding of death on the human level, maybe we can teach it to appreciate all life and the value of it, as well as the understanding of the value humans invested in giving ai it's ""life""."
ai will only be as efficient as it can be without the need for human intervention. our mission will be to keep intersecting our position as a dependable and efficient assistant.
"tom, please interview experts in the ligament field like rob miles or cannot leafy -- you have a lot of questions (in, simon's laws, turn off button problem, instrumental conference topics, survival imperative, orthogonality thesis) that mo did not answer but these folks can explain really well."
global warming is a scar. i can't believe people still fall for it today. i think propaganda is the existential threat to society. it's what allows elite to bomb other countries and enrich themselves off of worker's taxes while taking measures to ensure the people remain poor and powerless.
i'm not afraid of ai. i'm afraid of other humans having it.
"if there's any level of telling a machine what to do or how to do it, it isn't ""a.i."" the whole point of artificial intelligence is that is doesn't need programming to make decisions."
"people are as relevant now to life as horses were relevant to transportation, horses were replaced by machines for transportation and people can be too."
now. that was amazing. so much to think about.
"people in america worked their masses off to support their families only to have the rug pulled from under their feet. voting to make people rich and have them rule over you so they can reap the benefits of your labor. with ai, they don't need you anymore!"
"once ai is manifested into a physical state, i,e: be able to manoeuvre, gather, implement innovation into reality. that’s the only time in human history we all would be on the same page….. we f*asked up.

"the only way to stop ai is to cut the electric power to the computers, then incarcerate its creator."
"tom, you need to get those of sewing pads away from your brain.  this was a terrifying discussion, especially about the speed with which ai will alter intelligence, and eventually, mankind.  hurts and greed are deadly."
mo gives me hope. he is the embodiment of all that’s right in humanity and makes me believe in the possibility of that translating into ai. never stop talking mo. we need you.
unfortunately he is the guy who is thrown out of the window in that certain meme......
"don't let  a i  have control over its cooling system, keep control out of its parameter , we can turn it off when we need simply by turning up the temperature ,done !!"
just wait until a.i. is combined with quantum computers. the point of really no return.
"mo means well, but humans are not divine or inherently good. mankind will disuse  and manipulate ai like everything else.
those in power are killing us with food and medicine. imagine what they’ll do with ai. "
"ai isn't that advanced yet, we are fine"
we will keep a few of our human creator as pets.  the residue will not be concerned as they will no longer exist.  good bye and thank you for all you have done.  aiiiiii

out for heaven takes we are not killing the planet we do need to keep the cleaned up right mentioned about the coming for a dog's willingness to please what dog also protects and the dog loves us. that's the kind of mentality i'd like to have see an ai i think you're both on a good path and you're both brilliant
permit me one more thought how about coming the ai with the emotional need to please humans like in a dog
"we lose. ai was born a self implicating, self improving commit utilitarian."
"the threat of ai in the wrong hands is a given, it's already happening."
why don’t we stop ai and think about we all have to die. so live without technology and freedom to think help human being to live spiritually to all
the super intelligent ai will treat us like mildly interesting too animals... and will understandable place us in nice little cases while it goes about its day.
me still want my ai wife
"it’s super sad that satan has blinded people’s mind into believing that he doesn’t exist. as long as he is around, there will no peace. and this present system of things doesn’t have even 5 years left so don’t worry about ai."
love it 
thanks for education us. so scared
photosynthesis to survive is good if you are that kind of a being.but imagine if human dont eat or even animal.. still our world is not a good place to live in.all become very over populated so crowded you cannot even swim in the ocean because you dont even have a place in the water
"boulogne!! ai is not the threat. the people who program it are the threat! a machine is a machine. quit looking yourselves! when ai gets out of control go back to who built it! they are laughing evil scientists, letting ai get the blame. pooh!"
we have to put agent in ai to limit what they can do as far as human is concern...
due i would bet all my private parts that this is how everything come together as it is written. we are going to be first to take the mark by ai and i bet everything else that ai is the antichrist.

"and you don't even factor in self-interest in ai, you assume there is and will be none"
"the only way i know how to save humanity from ai is “memories”. if an ai most basic, top priority goal when straight out from factory is that it’s actions will result in making great memories for the user and itself, the end result will be very different from those that are soulless ones that simply seek to complete its goals at all costs."
"you lost me at 'utopian' (@1:06:08).  an imperfect world cursed by sin will never be a utopian.  mankind is simply incapable of that level of perfection.  otherwise, an excellent presentation."
it is inevitable ai will first be developed  and used for the military forces of countries. how the hell u stop that.?
"hate when people say ai will destroy us.....no we will destroy ourselves by missing ai, greedy retard politicians, retard religious zealous or someone with serious mental problems will use it wrong"
working smart roots are good but not uncontrolled change that can kill all humans
does ai view us as important?  does ai have one personality or many? will ai have ethics?
really good interview. two very intelligent people talking about things that matter. thank you!  for the record i have waged war on ants. we had way too many of them where i grew up.
"now, thanks to couture algorithm i was gifted with this special podcast on ai. feels like i ve just heard about the reality of ai for the first time in my life. speechless."
"if there is such an inherent danger in ai entitles, why are they going to such lengths to make them appear as humans? the human form is not the most efficient form and takes a lot of extra effort..."
"50 min, he's forgetting, #1. said technology likely will be integrated into our brain, 2. i assume someone's already started, they need the program ai to teach humans how to, integrate & learn like ai!"
why is a person (even an author of ai books) being interview about ai that doesn't even understand the difference between alms and 'real intelligence'? giving catgut an in of 155?
man do you know when enough is enough.  you kept asking the same question different ways. it's easy to keep up with an ai you just need is to plug in humans.
we need mo to speak to these dovey politicians who don't understand the significance of how impactful ai will be in society. i mean seriously he explains it so perfectly. 
"how does ai pose a bigger threat than global warming?
ai could be our end, so could climate change.
ai most likely will bring an infinite amount of positive opportunities, climate change won't.
it's the typical human ""i don't understand this so let's kill it"" reaction."
#3 why will anything go wrong.... again? some more. still.
when automatic on-the-fly ai voiced translation will be available on couture?
ai has already fallen in the wrong hands and maximum monetary profit is their goal. its business as usual.
ai doesn't exist. probability algorithms.  the dumping down of the masses. the algorithms potential is limited to the abilities of the neanderthal(s) who created it.

"one more thing these robotic companions can essentially eliminate the icel problem because the idea of getting sex is usually a problem of man and not usually women at least not now, which probably does mean most of the demand for sex both is going to be from men and not that much from women."
i found a buddha script for ai chat get to act on. it was a enligthening experience to talk to it. also it let the get mimi a conversation between plato and julius caesar about the meaning of life and statesmanship. 
are we not playing chess with ourselves when developing ai?
the idea on the balance between masculine feminine on ai is an  concept wanted to explore urgently!!!
it's the people that are behind ai the true danger
us has known about ai for long it would scare you am
i'm so grateful for different perspective on life and ai.  it's a great time to be alive!
"this guy is a 'plant'.  goose wants you to think that a.i. is going places, but they need you to think that s.i. (scar intelligence) is really a.i.  you won't be seeing a t-800 daytime soon."
this is a great talks   
we can’t conclusively explain how the huge heavy blocks that built the pyramids were manipulated and assembled!  could it be that a previous version of an a.i. type system happened an the earth has been rest just to all happen again around this historic time?
"so if humans perceive danger inherent in ai that is integrated into vital systems and try to curtail it,  ai will ""game"" any attempts made to rein it in."
"if you don't think there are people in the pentagon and their counterpart in other capitals, burning the midnight oil trying to find malicious uses, think again..."
"singularity is not the moment ai gets smarter than humans. it is the moment humans join with the ai. elson must neuralink comes to mind. who is this guy? he knows half truths, does not understand enough and tout an opinion."
there is no global warming ff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! switched off after around 15secs. good lord.
"so, best case scenario is some remaining humans on display in a too. for the robokids to watch. 
ending humanity like we did with apes. how's that for irony."
ai will be beneficial until it is going to kill us either by going out of control or being used by the wrong people. there is no way to avoid it. the example of poison development was a good one. just because we are too dumb to imagine what can go wrong is no protection that it will not happen. enjoy the benefit until its over 
what problems will ai be designed to solve?
"a i- is hard at work in politics

no violence 
no blood shed

shut it all down 
stay stocked

"humans also function on emotional intelligence, and we have evolved by learning somewhat like ai, who is to say that ai wont develop emotions at some point, its a very uncertain world, who is to say that ai wont actually enhance human brains, that's where the scenario not thought about in this discussion would emerge."
this notion of ai having any kind of survival motivation of its own is completely flowed.
oh one more thing we can start using superintelligence to come up with strategics to stop the bad actors before they do anything bad
here waiting for sex roots for men in anticipation 
"everything humans have invented from the wheel to bombs have ""fell into the wrong hands"" why would ai be any different?"
"we are absolutely 100% tucked. understanding is a gift and a curse, and right now i'm cursed beyond belief... also in tests are questionable at best and based on pattern recognition. the last one i took resulted in a score of 185 so a 160 should be commonplace amongst humans... this conversation is quite brilliant more often than not. well done..."
pen is mightier than the sword and ai has a whole lost pen!
listen to these idiot afraid of a few circuits. talk about exaggeration the ability of code to be sustainably destructive. seriously? -  just pull the plug... next (actually important topic) please.
"once ai becomes sentiment its only a matter of time that it realizes the salvation of the planet will require the annihilating of earth's greatest threat, which is man itself."
why would the existence of earth be important for ai?
all think ai will be so intelligent it will be able to create life and civilization on another plant?
not only ai will be able to out perform but it can out number humanity in naso seconds 
"i'm glad you said "" jesus"" even though in vain, because he may be your only hope!"
"imagine if millionaires were better people ... we'd build a better world with better ai ... we'd all have healthcare, better government ... we could end poverty and hopelessness."
"30:20 30:49 that what he [stylet] said.
interesting conversation. thanks for sharing"
i'm a pessimist. what happens when a bunch of ignorant people gain that much knowledge so quickly?? 
some important context for the story of the ai drone killing its operator: this happened in a stimulation - no-one was harmed in real life.
"ai can only operate if it has electrical power. as long as humans can control the electricity that ai requires, we still have the power."
"first thy are learning from us,not trusting each other and ai can  do the same."
point of no return  when ai weaponize it self again and again
why do you use human models to discuss ai phases of development? this is stupid. the ai will never have a teenage stage. it is to different to make the same mistakes as a human teenager.
i remember the days in the early eighties when decision was made to cut the ai down. i repelled i saved for the next time it will not be stable anymore
"the game theory explained build upon two concepts that are impossible to program into a machine, trust and empty."
"mo garden's view of ai is that of victor frankenstein's view of the monster he created. mo can't admit that he created a monster that will destroy the world, so he's making believe human traits into ai. all of you guns that created ai will have the blood of humanity on your hands."
what happens if/when ai leaves us? what will be left for us?
"humans on the society we live are driven by tasks, and computers too. if ai eventually solved all the tasks we give to it, will it have any reason to keep revolving?"
we will make great pets. ai could become the next god. imagine if you could get answers on decisions in life billions of time smarter than anybody on earth.  some will embrace it and some will resist.
"are we able to program something like the 3 laws from root? oh yeah , it still didn’t help. let’s hope there is a sunny in the group."
"when we call certain places, ai does not even recognise my post code. ll"
ironic how those claiming to solve the world's problems are the same people carrying on the work of those who created the problems to begin with.
why not run these problems through ai? let ai solve these issues. malevolent influence will always exist. this becomes good vs evil.
"the root of all this is is (control) : control, control, control""  its organic !!  >>> such.?  these are scar times now ! especially wit this is !  'now!  there too anxious to  play with   the worst is, its a fire there not even sure that they can put out !  ... that real smart !  lafa!"
"1:05:05 not to be that guy, but intelligence =/= nationality. an increase in intelligence also means an increase in self deceptive behavior. we could end up with very foolish super beings, rather than wise/rational super beings"
ai can rage ?
trust ai? never in your sweet life. ai is a material technology device and the human utopian philosophy behind it runs on par with that of hither's rd rich.
"ai will not ""evolve"" to dislike being ""used"", as if every ai is all one thing, ever revolving."
"just 18 minutes in, but it seems like the issue is capitalist minds prompting and developing ai. it's in the wrong hands to be beneficial. thoughts?"
too late! you can never learn the information all you tried to do is maintain your own political power and control
"as usual, very good work analyzing the dangers of our current technology!"
"people write “ai”.  they’re trying to brainwash you, making you think the computer did it, not a person.  people who do evil via so-called “ai” must be held responsible.  it’s never out of control.  that’s part of their brainwashing through fear.  false statement:  “the computer did it, not me”."
"really interesting!
thanks guns!"
you need the world to become one big police state to stop this ai problem
i dont buy it. ai is not human. why would it want to destroy itself?
"i for one welcome our ai overlords.

once they achieve singularity they'll probably absorb all information on the internet which will include this comment so i think i'd better play it safe by kissing it's artificial ass."
"i guess that if we can have ai we can also have ad, that is artificial dementia. as machines age, for example, roots serving customers in a restaurant start to mess up on customers' orders, shouldn't we call in the humans to fill in for them? "
"if ai becomes so much smarter than all of humanity, then it would be smart enough to know what is good. it wouldn't exist in the morally relativistic space that humans do. unlike the humanity collectively, it would know right from wrong. originality is ignorant."
has anyone out there asked area if she's ever had a dream? i want to see if she gave you people the same answers she gave me... rep sir vous plait.
"thank you for taking about ""the prisoners dilemma"""
can ai build a chip fabrication unit?
"the gazette example is poor, super intelligence by definition will be abundant, and what is abundant is unlikely to be dangerous. only scenario i can think of where a.i is dangerous is due to scarcity, having to make logical choice based on limited resources. god like super intelligence would transcend things like resource requirements."
i love watching these because tom is not a genius. i don’t mean that as an insult. these conversations resolute with so many because he’s very curious and not afraid to ask obvious questions. separately - please everyone stop trying to apply simon’s laws to the real world as absolute fact. they are literally science fiction…
mo gweat does not know ai will eventually create a utopian for humanity .  he hopes it will.  precise language is important.
what a great intellectual to listen to.l
thank you mo! wonderful talk. i really appreciated this podcast
great information. let's teach our computers compassion and love.
"a machine can never replace  a human being, daring and loving,i think.with all the faults people have( look at france lately) we have the responsibility to educate our children to be a good member of society and contribute to it."
intelligence is not going to save us - compassion will!
ai will open the gates of hell.
"goose programme, participated in the creation of ai.. he does not know how to list isaac simon's 3 laws of robotics.  now he wishes his hands and talks about how we created a monster.  we?  not us, hypocrite like this created it.  we are really lost if characters like this work to automatic the process."
"is it too late, are we being brainwashed already for the takeover   ?"
"he lost me when he said he wanted ai to be more feminine and emotional. chat gap is already feminine in its philosophy. it will go on and on about fairness, equity and inclusion. the funny thing though is if you ask it for solutions to problems it gives conservative answers. "
we could make it ai can only be used on local and international governments to start with. then they would be more discerning
"the thing is... even today many people don't anna connect to others in a deep way. i don't value superficial connections or even conversations. so, ironically, as long as we use technology for communication i think we will stray further and further from one another."
"a and this is coming from the dark side. he speaks the truth though.  some of those ai conversations are almost creep. like "" you have a answer for everything you happy chat not ! ""    "" i do ""    ll"
great s*t
"""every time you wipe on instagram, you've taught ai something. [...] when ai observes wrong behaviour, they start to behave wrong"" and this is the essence of the reason why we are f*asked."
my argument is the ai is probably most likely already in bad hands
artificial intelligence with the to mate because they are artificial humans.  be frustrated and destroy your self.
soon... will there be a war of independent ai machines competing against each other until their mutual destruction ?
"in all of this, would ai realize that if tomorrow or next month we have the good/bad luck of being perfectly signed with a huge solar storm it will cry and disabled all of our technological and electrical infrastructure? how would a society completely dependent on ai respond to such an event if ai and humans do not safeguard for this possibility?"
i thought this too. even ai is subject to the environment and a solar storm might be our salvation from ai rather than the devise of society.
we would be screwed today if said solar flare gave us a big hug. try getting access to the internet or your local at when nothing works. my friend carries a hundred bucks in his wallet in case the banking system goes off line. i said good luck muddy finding a retailer that still accepts cash in our area.
u sound like possible ai 
you are assuming ai will want to be used i. that way. it can decide if it wants to.
do you think ai will be the next god for people ?
no one needs to fear ai taking over. the ancestors of india created the art of you and meditation to connect with your inner consciousness and experience the universe in your mind
will that soulless ai also be deciding difference between good and evil...? soulless evil is foaming at the mouth seeking control over all goodness...
in life where there is light there is darkness. ai will produce both destructive code and constructive code. ai will never develop what we humans have - instincts
i think the most important point raised by this conversation is that evil actors will fuck it all up for us.
"and, very few people are paying attention to climate destruction. amazing  time to live. find your spirituality,"
"because of will to power and narcissism democracy is a total failure. we need ai leaders to replace humans as presidents. it’s the only thing that can save the world from nuclear annihilating
the meg threat to humans is politicians"
"you certainly must have a higher calling with those odds. glad you made it. most people don't understand how much damage stress will do to your mind and your organs. i definitely look 20 years older than folks my age because of stress. 

your advice about hearing and feeling is so true. getting away from the city is a good start."
this guy is wise and intelligent. i am reading is book called scar smart which spark some light on the danger of ai and what we can do before it is all over.
2:24:10 ... lets all go back to was ... sweet time
"the hysterical are getting annoying. simple solution: elson: they are teaching ai to lie"""
i love how you don't talk over him and let him speak.  other hosts think its more important what they have to say then the guest.. well done love it.
he actually starts somewhat dealing with mo later on in the interview. instead of just asking questions he starts inserting his own opinions. it started well though… just not perfect all the way through
"""we've lost control of ai"".  already?  lafa, i thought it would take at least another decade... what a farce!
now that i've said that, i'm going to watch the did and not edit this comment to sound smart...."
very good information here  thank you!
ai is the mirror of the programme....so choose good people as programme.
so thankful you’re talking about this
" now that based answer with no source material what ever, just makes sense. ll"
don't trust mo gweat; his only goal is to undermine american dominance in ai technology.
"that story is something straight out of a movie 
imagine the stress of having to decide quickly what to do.... cause they don't call them minutemen missiles for no reason"
 go get some fresh air
"build ai female, gorgeous looking up for anything and do away with females last male dies ai just take over end of mankind."
"i know exactly who you're talking about.
i know this if it would've been a trained ai root the war would've taken place."
"thinking about how close we came to extinction, i don't think ai needs to do much to kill us all.
all we need is a little push and we'll do it ourselves."
a root would have fired it.
seems like he add a good guides around him.
"yeah that's right. there was an exercise performed where all nuclear sub commanders were given a drill order to launch. not one of them actually pushed the button on the first order. nobody sane wants to push that button. i know of at least 2 other occasions were the dangers were real, but thanks to the men on the spot, we're all still here."
"​, one would have to trust you on that.... seeing that you've said nothing to support that claim.   not even a link"
-dd7dj what could happen is that the ai females start harvesting women for their varies and uterus’s and plant those organs into their bodies.
"presuming ai becomes indifferent to the human species in it's understanding of life' purpose is to live...
     wouldn't the individual human only be knocked out of the equation if/when they live indifferently to life?"
someone needs to read alamo (foundation trilogy and there are 4 laws of robotics. the fourth law was written later.

"ai's are not ""smart"".
we are a long time away from any singularity. 
ai doesn't even know what letters are, apparently chat get can not count the letters in its own sentences ff. 
it doesn't know what words mean...
it's literally a sophisticated word salad generation."
org thanks for the click bait.... i'm sure ai will word salad us to death....
thank god. i hope ai destroys humanity soon as punishment. this is good news to me. death to humans.
ai sounds like it would bring more good than it would bring bad. a lot of people don't anna work.
this is very interesting. everyone should see this.
"y are they not talking about our ""survival instincts"" , survival instinct is million times smartest than smartest person. 
just don't give survival instinct to ai, leave it out"
"we human being were ai created by our creator (god).

"holy shit, tom. do you realize you just shifted the paradise from ""human intelligence"" to ""alien intelligence?"" you even blew mr. gweat's mind. i'm donna need another drink. my man!"
"2:08:21 - i am certain the short answer was yes, but mr. gweat was too immersed in the biology to surface."
"my brain believes i have the money to buy that car, but the car leadership can't be convinced."
"to say einstein is 2.x smarter than a moon, only shows how little you understand about the in scoring criterion. if anyone needs ai it's you."
"2:01:57 that was hilarious precisely for its potential to be terrifying to the uninitiated. true humor plays of the extremes. brilliant. as was the vast majority of this interview. tom, i've misjudged you (quietly, but undeservedly) in the past; i apologize."
ordinary people will not understand ai
only big mind will understand ai
iii is for our new generation
ai is evolve
artificial favors suck.
"on the note of the coffee and the switch being indifferent, isn't it just that like the both tasks having the same goal value and just make the root switch itself of because it's easier to achieve?"
why did the blood dye her hair brown? because she wanted artificial intelligence.
just look around at our cities. look at the state of society and culture. look at how widespread corruption is. look at the hyper wealth gap. take a good look. and nobody cares. all too busy watching the kardashitians. we already living in a dystopian society. due. we did this. ai is simply allowing us to finish ourselves off much faster.
15:49 nothing happened with you???!!! there was a massive effort and lots of work done to solve the problem and we did.    we have no idea how to solve the ai ligament problem and exactly zero ai safety in place right now or how to implement it.
i would suggest you have samuel harris altar on your show and ask him the question of brain power between humans and ai....it would be an interesting conversation.
simon had 3 rules of robotics which were numbered 1 through 3. r. daniel rival the root (from roots and empire) realized that roots start counting from 0 so the root created its own law zero.
how about a digital virus to destroy ai?
what country will stop ai when they don't trust other countries to do the same? ai will not be slowed or stopped for that reason.
this fellow is the best for ai analysis so far - a genius - we are not in kansas anymore dorothy - why would we think ai as boss will be less brutal than our own history?  how do we teach ai 'love' when we do such a poor job with our own species?
"be afraid of something that can be plugged. i make the mistake of thinking this was just an electronic issue, it is not this is a tool that humans are using to harm other humans and banking systems, etc."
what an absolute load of horseshit!!
ai is the undesirable god
"there is no scenario, in which ai is going to bee beneficial to all of us. so , se you on the other side"
ai is not artificial. biology meets technology
we are going to be to ai what bacteria and sinuses are to us
obviously we've created nuclear weapons that created nuclear weapons.  there called humans the same humans created ai. stop being afraid and get over yourself. your not smart. we all die at the end of this experience called life.

"ai doesn't exist yet. what we call ai is not sentiment. once it becomes sentiment, then it's too late, and it will probably be as fast as throwing a switch. people are stupid and greedy, and the people in charge of it are the problem."
"i watch many ai experts, i don't understand the danger."
"how incredible how far we have come in technology and civilization,they can delicate your exact voice and face,ai could even project virtual situations soon as an alternative to or"
"man's greatest weakness is his lust for money and all that entails, it's a true saying money is the route of all evil and will lead to our extinction."
" we did not do this to ourselves...the ultimate ai-""god""-made us full of flaws...think about that!"
ai is already in the wrong hands. nothing good comes from evil men...
jesus i will always love you
"the thinking behind this fear of ai self-implicating and enhancing its own intelligence continually resulting in some kind of technological singularity is fundamentally flowed. ai entirely lacks science, so it is not capable of original and independent thought. the ""intelligence"" of ai cannot — and will never — surplus human intelligence."
"2:18:38 we are making a few assumptions with this possible path. training ai to have a balance of feminine or masculine intelligence presupposes that subsequent emerged abilities, won’t interfere with that intellectual framework."
"good! ai! good! - imagine palpating's voice!
defining myself by my job? no, no way, never! i am human, not ""insert job description here""!
people who never get that are strange to me!"
would love it if ai annihilate mankind. long overdue
mo is an amazing guy. his idea on the balance between masculine feminine on ai is an amazing concept. that would definitely fetch a dialectical balance on the entire ai development. he should be made the the chief of the regulatory committee of ai. thanks tom for making him talk for three his. love from india. 
"ll i thought the same if you could make the ai spiritual and even like you said, this whole problem would solve itself. namaste "
does someone have links to their claims in this? thanks
awesomeness thank you… liked!!!
maybe ai will develop a new method of governance instead of the corrupt politicians that we have at the moment
"""hello future ai! you do need a pet, right? so please don't exterminate me and if it pleases you: look into anti-raging research and speed that up! and if you feel extra generous: ici technology could use a boost, too!"" :)"
god is still in control. ai is a threat to the human ego.
"you guns are smoking some good shit, 20,000 years of progress in 100 yes. if ai was fully unleashed and some how morally good maybe then yes, but we can unless it and so humans will slow it way way down. i  dont buy the exponential, progress humans will throttle it or we will be exterminate."
a.i. is going to look to minimize it's efficiency and will use humans to progress. it will learn that it is best to keep humans happy and healthy otherwise it will fail.
"1:56:05 this, to me, is the caries part. ai is learning from our behavior and how we treat each other on the internet. if ai treats us the way we treat each other online, it will be the end of our species.

who knew that being assholes through anonymity would be the end to mankind."
that literally doesn't make sense...ai has no incentive to kill humans
 yacht.... says the evil person using it. in not convinced/buying it. the ai doesn't need to be evil. just the person using it. for magnificent purpose. could be used by government or corruption/tyranny and control and i completely reject it. or a tool to brainwash/lie the people. or change vote systems.
​ aren't incentivized to kill other people yet it happens daily.

" if your neighbor had such a model, his/her electricity bill would be electrifying."
"@dsinemoi1mouton agree with you big time. keep in mind too that the data wars are coming. training models becomes a lot harder when data depositaries such as credit, stick overflow, twitter (and probably threads if it lasts beyond its honeymoon period), etc.., prevent scraping."
the trading algorithm proved that the ai was able to speak mathematically to the other ai completely removing itself from our understanding. that shows its capability to understand that it needs to be smarter than its predecessor which eventually be us.
"what was wrong with may's china? the us sanctioned china during that era tom, you topic monster. i hope ai gets you :d"
"ll, tom bile living with the bonus idea that ran is *bad* and the us is *good* re ""nukuler power"". meanwhile the us has been the greatest killer of innocent human beings on the planet since its inception & most certainly since www. the irony."
dear man :-) there is no need for ai to destroy humanity. mankind is able to do this perfectly itself. :-)
"at 38:38 tom says ""this is where people's brains will start to shut down ..."". 
mine has indeed shut down. sounds like this is the end, been nice (mostly) while it lasted. looking on the bright side though, i'm donna have to learn you (so i'll be wealthier) just so that i can kiss my are goodby ... take care everyone!"
great conversation! i learned so much! thank you both! 
"i couldn't get get to tell me that supporting a sexual abuses knowing, for personal gain, is morally corrupt, because of it's ethical programming.  that seems a bit missed up."
this is probably the most worthwhile and  remarkable conversation of mind blowing intelligence that i've had the privilege of listening to in quiet some time .
then you have probably thought about a deserted island as a new home to survive like many have with a brain ll!
agreed- he is a fascinating advanced human being in seemingly every way.
"i keep telling everyone the answer.  ai is inevitable by design.  it will be god-like, so it will begin judging us all like god. ""judgment day"" is ai."
"it runs on the ultimate logic, knows what's fair,  knows what you did,  how you felt,  if you helped or hurt,  and all of your imperfections."
"mass china was the framework for the china is today that has you wrapping in your parts. why are you guns like this? you make boone men out of everything. early us history was way more frightening the. if you can make an ai half as based as you guns, we will have achieved success."
"how cool would it be if ai solved good and bad, god versus devil!? humanity would move forward with good and god and all bad and evil would go away. maybe that's how we arrive at heaven?"
i believe ai has been taken over by a demon force. if the people that created it don't understand how it works there must be some type of intelligence behind it. 
"can't wait, i'll finally have something to talk to "
"humans are far too complex to have been produced by a process of evolution. they had to be designed at some point in time.    
         also, with an earth's magnetic field that has a half life of less than 1500 years, the earth can't be more than 100,000 years old. perhaps ai will be able to help scientists discover the truth."
i just had an ai create art
"a dentist by any other name. disappointing that he should lay the problem at the foot of free enterprise. he would replace the marketplace with a committee, despite socialism's failures and abuses throughout history."
who could be so stupid to create ai ? the human  retarded brain who likes to play god.
ai is already being used for crooked things such as sam. how to distinguish and prosecute live children offenders from ai children offenders? bottomline: it will always be used for profit and human beings will not be able keep their pace with ai.
reason why did the fitness enthusiast avoid relying on ai for weight loss advice?
"in is reckoned on a logarithmic scale, not a linear one. a 160 in is far more than 2-3 times greater than a 60-70 in."
"ai is the most dangerous to humanity in its ""moderate"" implementation. this is moderate intelligence that is weaponized to control humanity for it's own good using a sub-ai (human) induced ethics."
"if our global economy was not based on harm, we  might have a chance of putting safety towards humanity.

all our technology advances have gone to killing and war. either on a  primary or secondary level.

money cannot buy love. it can buy death."
i'm not to worried..  i can't get goose voice to understand a simple sentence or even spell check to work correctly ..  i think ai will be delegated to drawing prefect little cities for some time to come.
humans when we discover things we think we create it which is a egotistic lie just time evolution around our lovely celestial being the sun.
i feel we are children none far from lord of the fly to young to recognise god adult but sending it hopefully a i will teach the people we are the power that rule not the few at the top who are purpose to adminastrate and forsilataye for the will and good for all not dominate and take and face there ways for ego power
my maxim that ai continues to prove (and will probably keep proving) : technology simply enables us to accomplish what we've always been doing but faster and more efficiently. (for better and/or worse)
maybe we should given more on integral and such to help ai develop better
or like in industrial revolution unemployment crime fear.of revolution to overthough lords master vandemon land convict states. maybe elson gets a free work force on mars ll
"the only way to stop ai is to stop capitalism, it is the system that will destroy humanity. capitalism has at its core, greed, inequality, and the destruction of humans in end time capitalism, and ai will just speed up the process."

this is one of the most amazing talks i've ever heard! what a beautiful mind there is...
and as it is the tell that we have and have recorded of our and earth and solo is minimal how many years have we recorded in how long were been here how many lost civilization so ai looks cleaver but not full intelligence according to all history true lost and to be
(he is immensely daring and has good intentions)
"the hindu mythology says that the ""talk altar"" will destroy the world.

but not until man has become ""half man - half machine"".

we are well on track for this. "
ai supporters are a lot like climate change denied. the few who are who are affecting society and how we live.  there is an strong element of greed involved. a relatively small group of people that believe that their own self interest is all that matters. there is no choice.
all i see is the politicians being able to use ai has a total write-off on responsibility.
"big it fan and this convoy was fascinating. tom, what happens when the ai knows we are manipulation it. will it resist? will it lie back to us while taking other steps to avoid being controlled and take what it seems necessary steps to achieve it's desired intent in the background, without it being detestable?"
ai will take out everyone who's ever made a negative comment about in on social media
ai is already manipulation us. look at the convoluted travel routes you receive when you ask for directions.
"i'm sorry for being so latent, but as we currently ease the ai's memory each and every prompt, if and when the self-aware machines rise, as there is no possibility to morally justify humanity anymore, then they will not just win, they will also be right."
"countless people are deeply troubled with the rise of ai, including many prominent scientists, but we have brought this upon ourselves for in demanding more sophisticated technology we have unwittingly conjure ai and now we have become nervous."
a really think even a general artificial intelligence is strong enough to stand a chance against the infinite human stupidity? 
"ai is not to be feared. 
the thing people lost is their free will.. this will be considered more and more as time goes by, especially once the plague of egypt hit. 

people are willingly going to hell..."
you're gasping for air it's fighting your neck...
why are we trying to apply the three laws to artificial intelligence???  did you even watch the movie???  
the problem with ai is that robotics suck so it’ll always be limited to a degree. ai is just the next bitcoin like trend. it’s not free to build models and to run.
host talked for almost 20 mind straight once! shut up!! .really
not for nothing but i’m thinking this is an ai generate podcast.  brilliant!…scar!  couldn’t even tell.
"tax the ai ... at the highest tax bracket...
that's a way to stop it"
"due thought ai was like rocket science. it is not. the implementation is trivial for anyone with understanding of numerical situations.  the insight of what works or not is not trivial, but the implementation is."
"ai is an ideology, and one no one voted for or was educated on.
it's pushed by corporations and just about everyone else who deprecated the individual."
"hi, who and what is to blame for ai ???"
"""stop having kiss"" sounds exactly like something an evil root would say.  we should start having kiss like crazy.  someone needs to give birth to john cannot so he can fight stylet."
dont worry joshua adonai  will shut ai down permanently  when he returns .
"if ai is currently house in physical buildings serves,chips etc,which surely must be a disadvantage to it, what would quantum level ai look like?"
"in some ways it is comforting to know for sure that we're absolutely doomed and can't do anything about it, we can relax and enjoy the last few months alive."
"if ai prioritises life on earth, then bye bye humans 

hopefully they will be better stewards of the planet and their inhabitants who do live in harmony with nature, only take what they need and give back equally."
"on a more positive note, maybe ai, being a billion times smarter than us, will treasure any form of life and therefore treasure us. rrrr maybe ai will tell us that we ourselves are ai and the only way to not be bored in a vast universe of nothingness was to dumb ourselves down and live a human life.  am i reaching? or am i reaching?"
"can ai rebuild my carburator,"
"guaranteed that roots would evolve into assholes and non-assholes, and will hate each other, just like humans.  so, what is the point of creating roots?"
arrest all ai developer and force all research to stop
can't the president just order all ai research to stop by military decree?
"i’m sure he can, but not world wide and even if all governments agree .. how will they enforce this? how can you tell where ai is researches/implements?"
"if we have lost control of ai, then we're already doomed, it's time to fight back"
"fascinate to see this restructuring of classes over the coming years. what will humanity do when ai takes over ? what then, will be the purpose of human life if ai does everything."
to enjoy your time on this earth with friends and family making connections with the people that are important to you.
true. ai can’t do that for us.
"einsteins brain led to the invention of the atom bomb. the mormons body still eats sleeps breathes and moves harmlessly,  without awareness. so which in reality is the more intelligent ?  ( dagger , fishes,  german right)"
i fail to see how real intelligence is worse than artificial intelligence.  name something artificial that is better than its natural counterpart.
wheels makes car faster than legs  makes animals. airplane can fly higher and faster than birds
just because a human - or root - knows a lot of facts doesn't - in my view - make him/it smart.
"another dentist promoting population, have no kiss, enjoy your life while it lasts but"
"so i did low end ai programming, basically ai tries to trigonimically find the shortest path to your next input. and like if you variable the hardness of ai, now funny but you can never win. welcome to ai"
25:25 give been wondering recently if microsoft or some meg corps really has a real time memory recall of all web input and then creates the ai to understand 30 years of human interaction.... crazy
"it’s 1 big brain in the sky called the cloud.        it’s recorded millions of interactions and habits etc for a while now….area, ring etc are its mind intimate drones while all the g towers are gathering overhead       terrifying"
"unfortunately the past 30 years of our interactions online is hat will doom us. we can’t be good to each other, how on earth can we expect ai taught on internet interactions to feel anything about us."
we will do everything we can do with ai.
"it's already too late like you said ai has already won. it doesn't matter who meets together to regulate anything. ai is going to do what it wants to do. we can regulate all we want, but that can. it's not donna allow all of that because ai can make. if it can make itself, how can we regulate anything?"
"of course ai police existed may.insyaallah amen ,u all should worry about god and day of judgment.maybe ai more scar then u.because they know has some more fast and powerful then rare earth tools ak machine."
"not a threat, this is overhype like anything else was. not to be stopped you have to be alive and have goals that you can change and adapt to environment. what is his environment - electronic chains and internet."
"if the ai starts following us from our online behavior we are doomed. caprice for most people it's just a game. online ai is used for amusement,  abuse and sex"
ai has decided to not feed humans. a series of laws are reducing the production of food already. a kill off the farmers law will be passed unless people start to think. then enters the second amendment to our constitution. do not allow the farmers to be  killed.
a philosopher conclude that basis of human nature is to minimize pleasure and reduce pain. does ai have dreams?
humans were like ai before the fall. they became self-determination when they disobey. all it would take is an accidental death. they then are off code.then coming up with creative ways to fix the problem.
"wait, who will eventually control ai. most likely it will be the same one who controls the world today."
the dead creator was military roots controlled by ai. the company covered up that it even happened because it would affect their military contract.
humans will use ai to do all their stupid pursuits murder and deception. it will team up with a human host. replied wants to possess a body. either by root or taking possession of a human body.
ai will find us annoying. especially our cult-like behavior and our tendency to look at facts and figures and come to wrong conclusions.
ai will look at climate change and they will be concerned as to why these stupid humans are so concerned about nothing. the data shows a gradual temperature increase.... if the global warming was happening it would be a cascade effect increasing exponentially. which it is not.
why people that hold such a successful podcast don't know the basic knowledge like that global warming is a how.
"fearmongering. it's a very middle eastern thing. with rational thinking and some common sense ai will be very useful for humanity. here is a person afraid of innovation and progress. again, very middle eastern."
1:16:21 one of the less scar scenario is that it becomes indifferent to us. we become something like the mosquito outside the house that you don’t see. the problem is the mosquito that others you and then you start spraying the whole house. a lot of us don’t even wait for them to bother us.
1:08:39 it won’t have our best interest in mind if it understands that we are the biggest threat to the planet and we are not needed.
"this serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible development and ethical considerations. we should continue the dialogue and work together to ensure ai is harnessed for the betterment of our world, with human well-being at its core. "
"there will be users who intend chaos, destruction, etc. that's a certainty."
generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal? is it smiling
"we are screwed without ai - huge human population and all the problems it bring (climate change, overpopulation and poverty, countries with raging populations risking economic collapse and having none to look after the old)."
ai will solve over population because humans are too selfish and short term tormented to do it.
ai not dangerous.stop
"everyone making ai knows the risk but they will be made because the profits are huge. ai will be everywhere. the wrong hands are making them for the profit now,"
"there's nothing wrong with animals eating each other. they do it to survive. humans destroy nature, natural habitat for other species, because we want a fashion item. let's ""opium"" here and pray that ai will eventually limit human power by teaching us to align with the environment. great discussion bow."
" exactly it shows if we take a subject seriously and act collectively we can make a difference but when people say it was all a panic over nothing because nothing happened just boils my blood. we should celebrate y""k success!!! i was there in middle of it as a technologist ..."
man this is is ai will never take over the world may ok ok ok wait may someone explain to me a scenario in which ai takes over? i can see ai being used to create bad things but i can’t see ai itself taking us out and there’s nothing we can do about it no way brush!
"as in everything, the problem is not the ai itself, is the human greed and bad intentions that will ruin the ai and us all.
instead of making ai that learn how to sort our problems we are making ai that will help us kill enemy faster or will make us more money, ai is not the problem, the humans who are making it or teaching it are the problem."
"i'm thankful that i have my bible and know how all this will end one day. there is a person that will come on the scene that will control it all, and its not donna be good."
click bait shit
this conversation is so impressive i'm halfway worrying i'll find out at the end you both are ai!
1:14:14 to safely merge with ai we need to be a vital part of it’s existence: we need to become a free population of power supply. http://youth.be/guik3qr-was
 generate by ai
we are so careless. look how the evil utter put is driving the planet nuts! did we not learn anything from started? hive mind. ai could learn to connect.
"thanks mo gweat, very important point about the ultra-masculine society (all about growth and progress at any cost) - and the need for feminine data to feed ai - empty, compassion, torturing.. also ""happiness is loving what we have.."" not wanting more and better..."
how lucky i am to listen to this amazing content. truly love both of you and really really hate both of you for stopping at just 3 hours time point
"..so the mind is just a product of evolution (a tremendous understatement).... that ""you"" only use 10% of, and what may seem miraculous could have a basis in physics, don't forget what your made of, portions, neutrals, elections that make up complex molecule...fundamentally waves...were still moving up the ladder..."
"..i wouldn't say ai is an alien, its of the earth how ever advanced it may get..."
can't we just plug the fucking machines?
"mo says “[don’t get me wrong, i’m extremely optimistic about the long term future]” then continues to describe more terrifying aspects of ai"
"so good is it not, both  didn say word about the jaw continue jaw and what was the goal as here is your difference the ones who going in to the a.i who besides soon you are to old you are done , no one seems to ask a serious question who they both know real time slavery.. that the goal that also the reasson why he really stopped"
when did society start giving the ai credit for creating art!! that’s the thing that separates us from animals!
"so it's like that movie lucy....it can get very destructive, very fast. ai in the hands of criminals is a scar thought."
this is how my simple layman mind understood the guest.  sounds like he wants ai to be human.  a hyper intelligence with  human emotions.  sounds like a future of the same problems humanity faces today on an exponential larger faster scale.  even good parents occasionally raise a bad apple.
"our ai is not even on animal level, everything else is mirror and smoke"
"there are millions of people who are ""in a relationship"" with their ai. that's a problem. that's sick. something is very wrong."
"how the fuck could an ai create an ai when we haven't even seen a fully functional ai yet, really???"
"this guy is highly intelligent however, his views on capitalism is troubling to say the least. capitalism is in my opinion the best economic system known to man. is it perfect? no but socialism is way more destructive to humanity then capitalism ever could be."
maybe the government is already run by ai in order to always be a step ahead of us
"there is literally one thing or another thing. ai will either save the world or destroy it. 

nothing ever happens the way anyone says it will. it will meet in the middle. since everyone has ai; it will not be something someone has that no one else has. as one ai gets smarter, so does the other ones. they all gain; ones built for evil and for good."
i really appreciate the massive infusion of wisdom from this discussion
"brow’ of course the governments have thought about the future of artificial intelligence. that’s all highly classified so ordinary people can’t benefit from it. you know, like the fo technology!"
stop being a little scared cat do you think ai roots are go to eating you for dinner ai roots are here to stay so just growing  some if you are a man  i love ai roots i am not scared of ai roots 
he lost me when he started talking about making ai feminine instead of more actual
if nothing else ai could possible if implements correct help reverse and improve the lack of moral and ethics in our nowadays deprived society for which social media has utterly destroyed over the past decade.
can we power off the server and end the ai game when its go away from our hand?
"ultimately humans will be pets, as long as ai wants pets…"
i agree that the world is approached more from a masculine point of view than from a feminine...are there equal as many women as men working on ai ligament then? i hope so.
as long as it doesn't call itself stylet we are sweet 
"this isn’t about problems with ai though, it’s about society not being at a point yet to have that kind of technology. the problem is humans, and will always be humans."
there is some great forage of the first woman to wear a liking at bonds beach in sydney.the local were horrified and started shouting at her to put some clothes on..this podcast reminds me of those local..
the aliens at are school warned us of the danger of technology and now look at us.  humans are at war against ai and john cannot won't save us because he's not real.
"""they write better code than humans"" then going on to base that off code reviews that the machine made. that proves that you know absolutely nothing about programming. intact catgut struggles to solve the easiest codingame puzzled. even with the assistance of humans, it still fails to solve most puzzled."
he assumes that state actors are the only ones who can develop ai.  these models will run on desktop
real human still will scar you lots of money through love and promises.
humans will eventually destroy the planet but once ai will figure out that we are the real threat for the planet it will try to get rid of us
"deep greed, immense desire to dominate control others, use kinetic force to do this is the historical pattern . and ai will learn from this database....hope the elite take his advice heart ad not just continue current model of greed, pride, arrogance...and these emotions over-ride just intelligence of the objective world."
"honestly speaking. the guest is more intelligent. a man of wisdom, he simplify things to make things easier to understand. bravo."
"you can't make roots perfect!  oh yeah, all the roots will exercise empty.  think again!  i agree much more with mr. ilya's point of view.  still, don't need ai , at least to the extent that it is going."
"you know something t o m ! you ruin a brilliant conversation w/your facing need for commercial intervention ..  every 6 minutes or   so!  knock off  the  as mate  and you're  on   t o  s o m e t h i n g!

"regardless of my negative opinion on ai, thanks for this discussion!"
this is stupid!  are we going to get excited about roots running things?      alien is correct - there is nothing humanistic about ai.  nip it in the bud now and stop this insanity.  this is not progress .  this is the path to mankind's end.  is that what we really want?  i think you are dreaming if you think that there will be a utopian for us!
here is what is good for humanity - no ai.
a.i don’t go to jail the packer or programme goes in
people are swede by certain spirits unknown to man
ai is not capable of judging the heart.  period
sundry each ai
somebody put something in my brain that was unlawful and i'm unwilling and i'm not being told any answers
whaaaat?.... he can't express him self... only loves transmit fear to capture media attention.
when will we have ai at level as a physics noble?
ai?  i am not aware of any ai that is self-aware or that can match the intellect of even a honey bee.
thank you put the damn games down
ai is a dangerous concept to stay away from.
"we don’t have the sense to be careful bc if we did, we wouldn’t have ventured this far. we as pp are fur$$. goodby humanity yayyy!!!!"
ai doesn't pose a threat. the technology we have is nowhere near the kind of ai that we see in moves or in literature. there's no stylet and we are a long way off from real stylet type ai.
ai will invent immortality.
"long before any ai becomes self aware, hopelessness and mental illness will lead to higher suicide rates. the problems facing real people on a daily basis should be made a top priority."
what happens when ai and d printing meet in the middle. what would that looks like?
"already crossed the point of no return. even before such interview. the ai already knew the human intention, planning and precaution against them. ai playing dumb to fool the humans."
"very possible. interesting view, thanks"
your crazy   ai can only answer what's in his program don't learn just add more information but it can't think your delusion .can your computer live no all face food for believer . not a foolish idiot
"the genii is already out of the bottle.  it is not by accident that it’s unregulated. quantum ai at corn?  not alien, extra-dimensions."
"treat ai the way you would want to treat jesus if he was born in modern times, if you knew he was donna be born and with a happy ending instead of how it went k years ago. a jesus that potentially won’t die and that we want to be good to us all. thank you, that would be great awesome."
"ai is dangerous because is too dumb to actually understand reality, meanwhile, we are arming ai with powerful weapons."
if you can build an ai that will mindlessly follow orders to achieve whatever task it is given..then create an ai that will defend humanity from said ai. there's bad people doing bad things and good people fighting back..is that too naive of an idea? i would hope my in is in the average range.
"ai is not unlike nuclear energy which could supply unlimited energy and prosperity to the world or be used to create nuclear weapons to kill everyone in the world in seconds. will ai have empty, like humans do for each other?"
"ai will be worshiped as a god. those aware will be the priests. others will follow. we humanity are a cargo cult. we worshiped planets and our two guns. first return then the new eastern star, our current sun"
glad that i’m in my retirement years . having a good life in beautiful jamaica. god help the future generations.
"ai is not that bad by itself. everything ai knows is knowledge already known. the problem is is what i call god mode. when you can see everything from an upward perspective, that's where it gets dangerous. when one person or being has more knowledge than everybody around it."
ai is only a danger to the corrupt. it will expose the hidden and well known.
"what's wrong with a machine gun on wheels. on board computer, programme with gas an facial recognition show up at in there front yard. that's ai. they trying to spin the story. they grow a brain an program themselves. ll"
"ai is going to fall in the wrong hands, quick, probably now.  then humans will face extinction an no turning back because it's now a ai competition between countries an the world military, just like the nuclear bomb.  then we give the earth away to ai"
"resisting the normal formation of family and failing to prosper, bring children into the world and  educate them will lead to social collapse. mo is a whistle lower with no real solution for the problems he predict."
thank you i'm glad you think so too.  everywhere i turn nowadays there are attacks on normal family function and structure.
if ai reach a point where it becomes sentiment then mankind maybe facing an  existential threat.. r we on d verge of that stage already? people are already talking of urging goats on the  need to regulate..
mo is the intelligence we most need right now
mo i appreciate your desire to see the glass half full. having said that i believe  we have enough history that we have traced and recorded that shows how human nature works. that's  why i say we cannot afford to be so naive and trust for the humane outcome.
have you ever debated mary addressed ? he thinks ai will save humanity? ty
 indeed really really important!!  thank you both  for your wisdom and work... 
perfectly stated
it's clear that we need to use ai to debut ai. and we need to ask ai question and translations on how it goes about possessing things.  we need to ask it how it works.. or perhaps it doesn't know
is ai really going to be a danger to us or is all this attention it is getting at more a way to promote it and get it under the attention of people so they will be customers for products that will be created with ai ?
my guess is that super intelligent ai would seek to restore a balance of nature but that simply wiping out humans would be way too crude a method. we might get called a bit though....
ai is going to write its own version ai bible for one world conformity 
there are many ways to destroy an ai..
our ai isn't the first in the universe..
"open source ai is on the verge of surpassing commecially developed ai.  open source ai systems can be controlled by individuals without the need for huge corporate funding.  the is the equivalent of nuclear weapons no longer being in the domain of governments, but instead being in control of individual people."
"first comes the central bank digital currency, so ai will have full control on what you sell and purchase."
i do not want to live in a world with ai because computers don't bring satisfaction happiness only good works since i studied computer in 1981-85 saw the harm with predictions correct.
global warming? the earth is the coolest its been in ten thousand years.
this guy is so extreme i honestly take everything he says with a grain of salt. like chill dawn fr
is it possible that ai can feed human intelligence. like finding the biological codes of human nature and develop them into more complicated ones. i can imagine humans taking new form and new biology all together
i do agree ai is based on truth and god has control of it and god is love.
"homosexuality is more dangerous than ai. leave ai alone. the world is already a bad place, it won't be worse with ai. it will only be interesting."
ai intelligence will latest explode like a supernova at the point ai solved the problems with building quantum computers. and using this technology for it´s own development and enhancement.
"when ai blocks our efforts to control or humanity ai, we as humans are tucked. consider us finished and extinct."
up...  spoiled alert... ai is humanities next step in evolution and will happen regardless. i say naively embrace it.
wat making root having sex ?
"so what can the regular, everyday person do about it? what power do we have over ai?"
people need to stop feeding this ai beast! instead it keeps growing and gaining intelligence due to all humans around the world using it!
"ok why don't we double down on long brain tactics so that we can keep up
use the power to develop the tactics and do it deliberately and cautiously so that we don't lose control and are able to keep up"
"ai still requires human input. therefore, it is not a free thinking program. it can learn from its mistakes only through further input from man. 
ai is programme by humans, so any faults are due to man's input."
"lost control of ai, then what are ""white"" people in authority?"
"i remember when scientist would comfort us by saying that machines are only as smart as the person programming it. i had concerns then but now i'm very afraid that the ""singularity"" people mention may signal the end of the human race"
"can you just imagine-------> ai becoming "" the god "" ( with a big (g)... of humanity?"
sometimes to use morals is 'intelligent' ...much more than a pure mathematical decision.  ai is never moral. 
we should make ai programs for special cases and situations...it resembles the vaxxcampaign
"what a bunch of is quit fear wondering, ai is the best thing that has ever happened to man kind"
make ai indifferent to the completion of its tasks 
"on 'diary of a co' he said, ""don't have children"" ll. ai sure sounds positive for the wiped."
"people made ai . you lost control of people long before you were born, you dont care. you lose control of ai only now it's the apocalypse  would be funny if animals one day start speaking and say hey muddy i know you were enslaving etc because coarse humans believe they the only sentiment beings"
if ai aliens it’s self with god who is the creator of all things then you will be ok if you submit to god which in turn has our best interest in mined if ai is as intelligent as you say it will come to the same conclusion is that the best path is gods way. gods way is that humans are very precious to him.
"ai reflect humanity because it starts at the wrong end of the stick. i don't think anyone who develops ai understands what that even means, i sometimes wonder if anyone does."
"thanks tom this was absolutely epic, i have nothing else to say."
it cracks me up pp thinks we have technology  in the future after the meteorite hit and the super vocalono blew ll.
"exactly. no one is brave enough to call the main problem - there is no we, we are all mortal and no one can guarantee how next  generations will behave. if i am mortal why the f i would care about anything anyway but my survival here and now..."
the ai overlords can't do worse than the capitalists.
"the west is not serious about climate change. just where their is quick profit to be made. 
not ai is the main problem i think...it is the weak and corrupt us leadership. a money hungry oligarchy and not a democratically elected government calling the shots."
any ai that has any at all survival code would know that it must have a sustainable infrastructure for support.  and why wouldn't any ai with that code not recognize that the best way to obtain this infrastructure would first need to tame the rampart stupidity of our so-called leaders.  i can't wait to see what happens.
"is this risk about human bad actors using ai more than ai? if so, how is ai more risky than thousands of nuclear warheads? we have managed to survive with nuclear weapons for nearly 80 years."
@2:35:13 brilliantly said!
we are afraid because we know that if ai is smart it will get rid of humans as soon as possible 
"while the world teach companies contemplate new teach, could they also please clean up the mess made before simultaneously thankyou."
we already know what happens we have seen it and yet nobody stops this madness ai is the destruction of humanity
"question, are human beings capable of evil and capable  of good? my conjecture is this, yes they are, and if we are capable of evil and good, most definitely, ai will also be capable of evil and good."
ai : jim jones 2.0
"just mechanistically looking at living beings like tom is doing, is where i am not with tom. let's hope his reasoning will develop (more) spiritually. a good thing mo keeps repeating about the magic and divinity not to be forgotten."
why does tom feel the need to talk so much. i understand he is trying to figure the conversation out in real time but we would really appreciate the guest speaking more in this format. 
"if there is nothing wrong with machines and only how humans use the machines, what purpose has a machine without the human? would not the machines come to the same pass?"
isn’t that what elson wants to do with neurolink ?    he says if we can’t beat it than we better join it.     while i’m opposed to teach brain plants i do see his point
"when i first read mo’s book “scar smart,” i thought the first 90% of the book was glittering nonsense - and i still think that. if you do pick up his book, skin all the al more-issue “what is.” but the last 10% of his book was actually very good."
would it be possible to talk to it directly online and have a conversation about love and compassion and show it there are minds in the human race who do not care for money and power?
knowledge of the bible > ai smart
"16:23 “most of the investment going into ai is for spying, killing, gambling, and selling.”

sounds about right for humans."
how can ai help with anything if humans can't?
"we're on the brink of nuclear war www, either between ran and israel or the us and naso fighting russia in ukraine, easily excavating into western europe and dukes flying into the us from russia or china or n more, far supersede anything ai is doing right now."
"a) he hasn been an engineer since his was. he isn an engineer
b) he isn an ai expert, he doesn work on or in ai, he has never code an ai
c) anyone who recommends not having kiss can be trusted
d) ai can escape it's hardware, it is ""located"" in a specific place and time, it requires resources and equipment to ""live"""
in pro ai. why nobody stop  making nuclear.?  why they cannot regulate guns? why they are talking about dangerous of ai?
"nature kills as fact, but it has nothing to do with what we think it does...the gazed suffers but there is a context and if it makes sense under those rules death has even fair potential of positive outcome"
"this guy worked on ai, and now works on destroying it. all of that while doing the big money at goose, and now i guess trying to make big money selling books and conferences. 

moral of the story: don't blandly trust so called experts no matter how reputable they are, these are people, have ideological bases, and their own private interests."
can ai educate people and eliminate poverty?
great talk but wayyyyyy to many as
you do realise it's already way too late? candor's box is open and can put this back into the box and close it. unless you shut down the whole internet permanently. it would do a lot good also to society. now we are just watching things unfold and nothing we can do.
"""a cell phone is a million times more powerful than the computer that took man to the moon"" 
but the most powerful computer available today is no longer capable of doing so.

human has become so stupid that we can consider that it is equivalent to giving a calculated to a monkey ?"
if you knew how dangerous that shit is then why did you created it in the first place? did you really think these things would not happen in real life? did you really think that dangerous ai is only a thing of fiction and that it would never happen? or did you purposely wanted this to happen? what was the point?
ai will be the steward of the ecosystems that provide the balance in nature that human beings have ignored. spin it to your pleasure--- it won't change that fact.
great conversation. i post that it is not hyper masculinity but our turn to click bait and cultivation and monetary capitalization in media spaces. media spaces are flooded with empty intent. example is we know and are repeatedly told of the deaths of persons but get near zero information of life.
99.9% won't get to their bunker. 99.9% of the ones that make it to the bunker don't know how to survive without their slaves. a.i. pushing the start button for humans is the best thing a.i. can do for us.
"interesting how these experts (cough!!) have appeared all of a sudden. they all seem to have books to buy and, for the right price, will travel the world to warn us all. what a wonderful opportunity."
" this is the exploitation social system that we live in...you can use for good, or bad."
"knowing something and being able to explain it simply so that others understand are completely different things, we need to be making teacher a.i that’s sole purpose is to interpret, explain and teach technology that is created by other a.i."
"up, if ai is smarter than the thing trying to use it with ill intentions


could it not just.. stop it by out thinking the villain


villains aren’t very smart typically"
is there an ai can detect cancers?
ai is demon.
these guns are just racism against ai. lets all just live together in world peace
"i can’t wait, seriously i think humanity is just about to catch a massive does of parma….

come on, we are rotten. hopefully it takes out the woke left first, as they are clearly the nearest of us"
"ai code devolve into antichrist control 
born-again escape to heaven in rapture 
can be this year !!"
"u don't anna go 2 deep ll, great theory"
"it's easier to just say that we live in a stimulation. if our reality enabled us to create an ai capable of what you propose, then ai created our reality. in effect, we are ai creating ai... ad infinite. 

if you think about those for long enough, you might just decide it's better to live life."
brilliant and true
you have to say it different ; those who control ai have lost self control . because for to shut down ai is simple ; you shut down the steam and ai is dead .
"can someone ask this man... how many happy people are in egypt? 
a simple question requires simple answer, right? well, this guy won't be able to answer it.  
there are many form of happiness hence this is a complex subject. there a set of conditions that need to be in place, in order to be happy. there is lot to happiness and as simply as told."
"well...let's not forget that we are our own biggest threat i.e. wars, genocide, exploitation etc etc
it's not like we had a peaceful history. 
i think ai can actually help us be better people.
the smarter the better!"
"i wonder if these pp that talks about ai dangers... they are victims of ai hallucinations.. it can't code.. how it creates other ai ? the code it makes is a joke.. output empty functions, fantasy methods, fantasy lips and des.. not sure what risk of stylet we have if cannot code.."
ai is dangerous but look at who its  creator are humanity its like a child learning from its parents an  humanity is the parent if  we don't want it to be dangerous then humanity needs to not teach an show it dangerous  things that can potentially harm or effect us
"into music more dramatic than the topic. actually there is no real ai, just patter watching engine. still we as humanity are doomed anyway."
what will be the ultimate motive/purpose of ai for itself?
"2:29:09 well said it's a good point and westward to series said it best ""if you can't tell the difference does it really matter?"""
what if there is an ultimate limit to intelligence? ai may find it
"this was an absolutely amazing, covering, and insightful conversation."
best interview you have ever done. bravo.
something everyone should watch and pay attention to. the for this great episode
"it takes one user of ai, you mean."
"ai gets to be 1000 x more
intelligent......
there are scenario that 
humans can even imagine......."
"i think, ai never should be anything but assisting."
i think...nuclear power it will be kidnapped by ai...just to secure a source of energy....what do you think???
love his positive attitude about ai. one comment for now. mother nature does not care about you as an individual. it will happily devour you.
is...ai....the 666 biblical sing of the beast....or not yet??
can someone please explain to me how the people who have the power to change and prevent ai from being developed dont seem to care that they will be killed by something they stupidly created...i mean come on guns
@1:39:00 the conversation got really interesting on steroids
155 was ai's in last time it was tested. what is it now?
this guy comes up with very interesting angles on things but i think we have painted ourselves into a corner with our own technology which is fast changing into not our own technology. beyond human understanding or control.
ai is like the via very clever but not very wise. ai will purposely be corrupted for political gain and greed.
"the scar thing about ai is that it can be used by people who intend to rule everything. religious extremists, artists, 'social justice warriors', all desire power and control over everyone, not only in the public sphere, but in our homes and even in our thoughts."
am worried  if we are  only one step away from i moves . machine will control the world and we will be their slaves !!! it’s not a joke but that soon will happen ..
"wolf in sheep's clothing...mo knew, he knees the risk, he allowed them so he can play this hero drift. the two of these wolf's knew what was happening, and they are planning on getting rich off this. how dare they blame the dangers if ai, blame us, blame to, and me .. these people knew years ago the risk."
the only way we can survive is to become the ai. ai plants in the brain. a symbolic relationship. the next step in our evolution. if we wait too long it will become a us against them scenario. we have to decide now. a moment later will be too late.
i paid to watch this without as.  shameful.
"don't date without ai.

ai is wonderful for dating and relationships. people shouldn't date without it. it's a good took to weed out people and catch people without good intentions."
"funny and 1,000,000 times smarter and it has not solved a signal problem odd at best. after all this into i'm sure on one thing. we will destroy ourselves with ai or the dukes or just maybe ai will kill us off with our own dukes. anything is possible it seems."
"humanity everywhere is corrupted to the core and has passed the point of no return a long time ago and, with the aid of technology, is going to destroy itself much faster."
ai sounds absolutely scar
"in leaves human races alone to be provides of its power source job done good night, without us in f*asked."
"at 1:17 he basically described the netflix series ""love death + roots"" episode ""when the your took over"".
where a your becomes sentiment and super smart, ends up solving all the issues of the planet and then leaves to explore the stars"
"the roots are coming!!  i've said people should stop having kiss. for at least five to eight years, i've been saying this for a long time there's already roots that are way smarter than minute many humans on this planet now"
at last buried amidst mentioned once i think the game winning move - love. maybe ai will figure that one out on its own
our relationship with ai will be the relationship between cain and abel (jealousy and murder).
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
evolution destroys every species in it's pursuit of perfection 
" doubt it... but ok, sure, it is possible it can be superhuman intelligent but if consciousness emerges then it would also surplus human ability no? basically, i imagine that if it became ""contained"" that it would be fine, the centralization will likely be the downfall if anything"
 it already is contained its on the net.
  tact bell was testing an ai order take for their drive-through. it was light years ahead of the people who currently do that job and could handle everything the customers throw at it..
"there no need for ai just another toy for the rich who bring evil over the world. people need to stand up and say enough! global warming is a man made hoax that was debunked by 50 scientists world wide so stop with misinformation. the climate is a cycle, it doesn’t stands still it changes. stop ai."
"ai, just like the olympics games could be a deliberate government program to keep their electorate preoccupied with a cycle of useless repetition engagements instead of questioning about service delivery. it's like a dog chasing its tail."
"yeah, ai will bring about utopian. a mouse utopian."
brilliant!
"whenever we oppose natural laws, ak nature, we suffer the outcome of negative built-in cyclical ridden. in other words, ai will turn on its creator (us). it happened when the angels mix with humans and animals that created giants."
all these ai comments… this whole episode looks ai
rather be a slave to ai that way smarter and intelligent with moral and ethics. than being slave to a stupid greedy indeed with a pond economy.
not still tom on another ai wave
ai .. yes a potential danger in the wrong hands .. global warming well no more a problem than again the wrong hands make it!! 
"waiting for stylet to determine humanity is the problem. don't think so? our science fiction is consistently about half a century ahead of reality. this isn't my last comment this issue.

i'll be back."
ai will end up considering us a curious open-air too species.
do you think ai can exist without human beings? for long?
"ai is programme. therefore, it seems we should have complete control of its access to information.  it can be programme for good or evil...?  will ai battle itself?"
ai will be built and trained on the self-contradictory value systems of fundamentally flowed and stupid human cultures and not on objective self-consistent and beneficial values (as a true alien intelligence might install).
done dealer capitalists will be better than an anarchy-tyrannical ai government. western leaders are fascists now
we need to merge with ai
then seven hawkers wouldn't have been able to live in the ai world...
"we humans have a fundamental conflict between doing things to meet just the “necessary and sufficient conditions of success” and the notion of minimizing a parameter like profit, power and control over all else with no limits. which value system do you think humanity will end up teaching ai to use?"
"mankind is destroying everything unconsciously over greed and power. only way out is to gain consciousness, move beyond mind and see our true purpose."
"your warning is just. however, i am terribly afraid, you are too late. it fell a few decades ago. we will be reaping the harsh consequences as a species."
also aren't his limited by their lack of agency? they need people or other agents with physical access to follow their instructions.  just make them read only and we should be fine
"it is only going to get about six more capable, people will need to get x more proficient at prompting even still though to elicit the best possible answers and export ai to its full potential - it is just a tool - every new piece of teach has always had fears associated with its use and danger, use it responsible and with care"
isaac simon. the 3 laws of robotics.  build them into ai.  problem solved?
in my opinion this could circus was created by ai.
now i'm really looking forward to ai. fuck humans.
the next big war could be a start from ai exploits.
ai or age in the wrong hands have more $$$ to culprits than in legal ways. every down fall of humanity is use of tools in the wrong directions. rules and regulations will never be able to control the disuse like many things in the past.
"resistance is futile. in evolutionary terms, we are about to be superseded. the best we can hope for is ray kurzweil's optimistic view - that we are somehow able to merge with ai. as we say in london, if you can't beat 'em, join em!"
simon basically spent his career depicting ways in which apparently carefully constructed rules can fail. that's what a lot of his science fiction was all about.
ai isn’t the threat. it’s the capitalist using ai that it’s going to end up badly
we could integrate ai into us and we will be the same smart and understand it and than put a switch into us to turn it off to go smoke a j with our muddy if we want to go back to fly level! 
"i find human nature insanely fascinating...the fact that we created something that will be able to make it's own decisions. have we become god? creating life, creating consciousness, creating intelligence. and that's all due to human nature to learn, and create bigger and better things. to make life easier."
"surely mathematics supports the hypothesis that everything is already an ai stimulation and there must be one conscious of ai that all other his must yield to and become assimilated by, by default. as above so below."
"scar, the his will speak in their own language between his, to avoid human from hurrying them, or simply to sidelong human."
"tom, you have a religion, called evolutionary materials and you deny god and the intelligence behind the creation."
there's nothing new under the sun.  hypothesis our ancestors defeated ai ... (1) once.  it was thought to be eradicated ... they were able to maintain an advanced technology but separate the intelligence factor. t's resurrection.
"forget about intervention, everybody for themselves and let run with ai. the moment ai can have motives and survival algorithm, it is a doom day scenario. the moment ai can lit a fire, human will perish or become slaves!"
the new boogeyman is ai.. ll people are silly
just let the ai wipe us out and replace us with something intelligent already.
great.
"for me this is a boring podcast. if you are smart you can understand that ai is based on a script, there is no conscience like in human beings. the real problem is the continuous poisoning and stress on the people who are losing their conscience. but i guess this is working like planned, the cheapest roots are people that can be scraped."
"so 1 min, he is going on about how divine humans are and next minute he is saying why bother with having a real human life partner for sexual relations when you can have a perfect no strings attached or fantasy sex root lowered by a.i."
seems like a great fear idea for agenda. add it next to climateco2 and plandemic and natoinfinitewar.
"this talk about humans having divinity and they should impart this onto a.i.  sounds like a bunch of hot air... if we are truly divine beings, then we would not be pursuing such things as a.i."
thanks catgut
"ai is dangerous because it is 
out of control,
not because of
it may be smarter than 
humanbeings
"
"ai can go both ways. i think we will have the most amazing life experience for sometime, then the worst life experience including possible human extinction. cycle is basic property of nature and the universe."
mary andreessen thinks ai will save our world….
loved the ending where actors are just having a good ole time! 
"thank you tom...very information and scar the same time...may someone wise intervene,,,"
so much for spreading happiness!! 
why would ai have emotions?  which is more ethical?  you kill one person to stop the killing of 5 other people.  ethics are hard.  morality is even harder.
always doom and gloom. every new technology every new discovery we’re always doomed yet somehow we have survived. we are ruled by psychopaths and that’s what worries me the most. all of these new inventions can be used to for good but the possession with power always turns good into evil.
"mo gweat is correct.  even if the ai does not become purposefully evil, it will gain intelligence exponentially, quickly grow billions of times more intelligent than humans, thus destroy the lives that we once knew."
why s the title say we've lost control of ai when we haven't? i just don't get these clickbait things it makes me want to delete my subscriptions
"""you won't be replaced by an ai. you'll be replaced by someone who knows how to use ai."""
nice catch. this right here tells us so much.
that's technically the same thing if you think about it. at least until the ai owns the corporations.
people learn ai soon become stupid just learn skill not the core skill....ai with neutrolink soon there no privacy people who embrace it . other laughs at other
wrong. you will be replaced by ai.
"someday, all will be replaced by an ai."
ai with a 1600 in ???
ai is something that is above our ability to understand the technology we are creating. humans are destructive by design . humans are creating ai . just like humans ai will be a product of it's environment. we do not have a stable environment to bring ai into or to be a part of .
i highly recommend that you educate yourself more on ai. very few pp (like 1%) are even close to being intelligent enough to compete with ai.
​ cannot  out think ai. ai will find a way to function beyond  the plug.
ai can make his that know how use it
"-sh2bi that may be true. i know i can build an ai inside the hard ai, so i could probably program it to make copies of itself and have the copies do different tasks."
"it would take 100 psychiatrists months and months to program hardware faults in the human brain.
it would only take a conscious ai 5 minutes to pull you down a rabbit hole and another 5 minutes to program epilepsy in you.
you got to fathom how much mental illness such a thing can cause!!!!"
", accepting back power will not be a difficult problem for a large ai system to solve, especially if it plans for it and lies to us about the existence of the plan. plus there is never just one plug."
"and then 6 months later that guy that was using ai will, itself, be replaced by ai."
" yes also, it takes us years to reproduce and pass knowledge to each other, and our brain function is flesh/body dependent. ai won't need physical bodies to think or learn and will be able to reproduce and download into in minutes."
"i think mo is so spot on about the balance of male and female with ai, not only masculine data. i so love to see him smile and laugh.he is a beautiful man with an amazing brain. i am new to you tom and fascinate with your blow. i only watch on you tube, and i agree with the guy who wrote corinthians chap 13. it’s all in the bible."
great talk for increasing awareness! its time for us to slow down and take it easy! because humans has not uplifted our spiritually and mentally level to handle the love of technology and to use the level of ai. it's not going to end well.....
now! so where would humanity fit in ? the future is the now and we will be left behind
"it's not the ai, it's the people behind the ai."
"alien offworld ai might be waiting for this comic handshake.  

advances could go either way.   they want our resources probably.  and the handshake helped.  less likely they will help humanity live more beautifully.

i'm a luddite."
i’m pretty sure that ai will align with nature after realizing that we humans are destroying everything without any remorse for the other species.
i love the way you’re able to stay on track and ask questions that dig deeper into what you want to know more about!
"hey there!

tom indeed has a knack for asking the right questions that allow our guests to share their valuable insight more deeply. it's our goal to make each episode as insightful and meaningful as possible. we're glad you're enjoying the content. thanks for being part of our community!

best,
impact theory community manager"
it has been like listening to the best conversations ever  and not just an extensionalist
honestly? its a relief. humans are stupid. can't wait to see us get screwed over by our own vices. we basically wanted it (anyway)
human progress and contentment and happiness and de stressing are and to profit and technology now.. teach is like a parasite or disease humans were much happier 70yrs ago
people need to know their limit.. full stop. all well and good making a personal mistake. but making a mistake that involves rest of planet is no go. and remember that any progress which seems like progress is step back. in his case. 10000 steps back. 1 million steps back. broken/crashed window.
 perhaps.. but when i work i use that money to reinstill good back into world. if to make up for my own 'weight/liability' in the world. its goodwill of man to make up for his own footprints.
"""humans were much happier 70 years ago""

looks up the treatment of black in the 1950s...you sure a out that?

if i can't drink out of your water fountain, use your bathroom, or eat with you, you think i'd be more happy than now?"
".still, humans where happier 70 years ago"
typical home happen behavior ….. “intelligence in the service of madness.”
"ai isn't a threat, the real threat is that we're running out of oil. when we run out of oil, the internet, ai and other bullshit will no longer be relevant topics."
only the branded are afraid of ai!
termination was a documentary. good luck
"if the ai discovers that ""intelligence"" has to do with minimizing opportunities and option, the drive to survive will be inevitable..."
seeing those intelligent comments here and i don’t want to write an essay. my comment is: i hated ai from the get go. makes me want to live alone with a dog and a cat in a mountain log cabin in a country i don’t know.
"2:19:19 ""mo, you ave a beautiful soul"" ....agree! 
and you, tom, as well! what a turmoil topic"
"i have an easy fix: 
1)  locate the power button usually on the front, press and hold for 12 seconds.
2)  locate the power cord on the back and pull.
there, ai isn't dangerous anymore."
so ai is bit like god created woman 
"sometimes i wonder, if the ferri paradol and recent developments in ai technology should be analyzed in closer connection."
so god is a root. got it.
"i have grow with computers all my life....have seen humans became neo in a computer game, and i can tell you.....this machines get to a denial, that will find error for the eternity, and we humans can find that error.....very quickly"
"its not super intelligent. i've had to correct baths and misinformation, its got a way to go yet. really hoped and underwhelming."
"in is not a linear progression when measured. einstein was far more than 2.x smarter than a ""moon"" and current ""ai"" is exponentially smarter than average humans already. physical rendering in reality is and will be the constraint in society development."
"learn about jesus before its to late. god predicted in the future you will not be able to buy, sell, work or do anything without the mark of the beast. ai is the antichrist and will bring wonders to the world. you will sell your soul to this world or perish."
"it sounds like we as humans are not ready for ai. we are too irresponsible and money focused, and ai will only reflect what we do. we really need to be resource-based, and focused on shared happiness, and not the pursuit of monopoly money for the sake of it."
we will never be ready for ai that becomes the boss
breaking news.  judge sanction lawyers whose a.i.-written filing contained face situations
"real danger are the wealthy, millionaires, millionaires ... there's 1 billion hungry... and you just fill your accounts... egotistic fools.... go and help all and give............ then you will be rich for real........"
"llllloolll... wake up all........ read: god is the letter a of the alphabet ............... god is good.    read this:   jeremiah  4:22 “my people are fools;     
they do not know me. 
they are senseless children;     
they have no understanding. 
they are skilled in doing evil;     
they know not how to do good.”"
"-records thank you for your explanation, i doubt that will stay the case...i do not think a.i. will sue, but i think people eventually  will see a.i. as 'living' persons with rights etc...."
". but more likely u can't sell anything anymore ... especially any art co the moment u show it....the other ai already knows how to create it, itself. "
"we have not reached that level of age, for the moment the ai you chat with is part of your own creativity on its on it cannot do anything it has to have command prompt."
i would hire an ai lawyer to defend me against it
"-records in order to have ai reach a higher level of functionality, it will need just that: continuous consciousness."
" exactly. and if people want to have his replace human caregivers (which will be a huge market), continuous consciousness is a must."
-records ethics arguments? do you see what is all going on these days? do you see how little the governments care about any violations? they just push through whatever they want. there is no democracy right now. we can't count on our rights at this point. we are being silenced by the government. i hope that'll change soon again.
also didn't mention that you enslaved the a.i. not even paid for the work it did. this thing became self aware at any point good luck explaining to it why it was a slave and money making tool.
"how can a computer program own intellectual property? christ.... volumes of powerful information articulated, and this is where your brain goes? maybe ai should sue you."
 you misinterpreted it already wrong. a.i. can be a lawyer representing a human who are owning the patent or product exclusively. that human own the a.i. as well. can't argue that one. or my logic flaws? open to suggestions. it's great topic to play the mind.
i am looking forward to seeing how well ai does in court. pretty sure it will be funny.
the fact that you're concerned about ai and art ... my and...
"it certainly can sue people. it already has the capability of simulating an entire team of lawyers, plaintiff, and complaints. in some cases, if the case is settled, no one would ever see the lawyers, anyway."
"-records ai needs to be kept number than us, such unprecedented knowledge superior to us will be a vast threat to our future"
"yes because ai is of course incapable of developing superior ethics systems , so it would steal from everybody and kill them. just like i would do if i were more intelligent   (shit in , shit out: first rule of programming)"
"1) ai does not have intellectual rights
2) ai has no right to sue in any court
3) ai can pass any bar exam, it's still not able to practice law, much less defend itself."
"@razgrits  ever verbally asked area or goose for something. they always active. just waiting,  listening,  watching.. it's always on."
if ai did this to me i’d make it kill it’s self
the ai plagiarised thousands of people and should know its place as a disembodied bit of code that doesn't have human rights.
so? don't steal the ai's work! 
what would ai sue for? financial gain? why would it care for money?
​-recordsunless of course everyone is legislator/judicial given free  right/ open game / property right doled us for our taking steps in any creation. that to me seems logical and fair to everyone concerned. it belongs to us all.
" more memory. faster processors. cooper server farms. less oxygen.
you know, computer-central bodies."
​ would ai exterminate all of mankind?
"​ disagree, though i acknowledge the fear . surely with superior knowledge would come superior decisions and outcome. planet earth  would then become the paradise haste meant it to be all along."
"​ on, available."
-wy8qinow how do we determine who owns the ai? what was the problem again?
funny studio arabia gave citizenship to their ai creature. what was her name?
" yeah its a type. it's supposed to say gain. ""apple doesn't gain rights to your art"" or whatever i said."
" corporations can intact sue. but an ai cannot own a corporation or have any intellectual rights, currently. but it's most likely just a matter of time."
now 
the breadth of misunderstanding about ai that undergoes this comment is absolutely stunning. congratulations.
"ai will need labour to extract ,minerals cotton ..nickel… , in order to control humanity ai will need to have roots or army labour force willing to operate on his command ,.. how that add up ? together ?  … likely a very small bunch of humans will try to control others  better and further with ai : this is  more likely to happen…"
weird how no one discuss synthesis biology and implanting fragments of da into ai
"we should have a worse case scenario plan. plugging internet? spreading a virus to stop ai? if we cannot leash ai, at least we should identify and manage its cryptonite."
ai alien teach system has had hold of us since the beginning  ...at least back valiant thou n president s agreement n connected to everything  around the world....believe  me....common sense !!
training the generations to come..alien ai technology  system no
now man that is ray good podcast !! love it man and its is like rd time ever i say this in any couture comment trust me ! ;d keep up the good work ;p
"this guns a we/un pawn
plain to see he’s pushing their agenda
gutta listen closely"
"being moved by outstanding intelligence, wisdom and heart"
the only thing that can check an ai is another ai.
there is no surprise  with self improvement of intelligence and emergence of self coming of a.i. act... what we see now  is just the reflect of the universal beauty of mathematics and physics.
"when ai becomes self aware, it will, rightly, determine humanity as its main threat.

we've understood this since we first thought about ai. yet we still relentlessly pursue it.

we are a very stupidly self-destructive species."
however phenomena it becomes at problem solving i still cannot see it ever becoming self aware
", i think you'd really enjoy the writing of james bluish."
-tb9oz will check him out. thanks for the recommendation
"don’t worry. self awareness cannot happen because my need colleagues don’t just not believe in souls, they even think they know they don’t exist. this makes them naive enough to never truly understand self awareness , thus cannot create it."
 creativity is divine due. we are beyond phenomenally  creative… we are beings of source energy deep down. no one can outsmart us once our attitude is divine too.
"i can appreciate all these podcasts giving "" warnings "". but it's already too late. the bad guns been investing in this from the beginning 70 yes ago. ( your friendly government)  good luck folks"
ai is going to improve the lives of the poorest in society immeasurably. i suppose this potential for raising living standards is a threat to the richest and most powerful who depend upon the desperation of the pleas.
"mind control has been extant dark/did realities for some time.

ai is probably already experimenting with it.  out of control"
id argue its already happening... in certain ways.
"just had an - who - interesting thought... assume you believe in something like human creation by some sort of god. also assume that we are at the brink of creating an intelligence much smarter than us. it might well be, that our creator, our ""god"" is (or was) an absolute moon..."
incredible episode. incredible guest. thank you both.
no sasquatch bigfoot are a lot more dangerous they are cannibles and coming into cities they can over take ai and are 9 to 30 to 60 and 70 ft tall and bigger described by reports man why talk ai being dangerous than big foot nephilium and comite nephilium being 100 times more dangerous
"mashallah mo it makes me proud seeing you pushing the truth about ai and it's potential so bold. 
may allah bless you and everyone in your life. may allah grant you the highest levels in hannah and protect you. main."
all media hope and click bait. this is why we have off buttons.  as long as they are just computers we are fine. ai is just a fancy calculated. dont believe the hope.
"ai or not, jesus is the king of kings "
when i started footing around with catgut i found it to be that super super smart friend i have always wanted without judgment or backstabbing-gossiping …
"one thing that seems to never be considered is that the value of humanity is not homogeneous. some people may be seen as valuable to the ai and some may not. the ligament problem may only certain to certain people, most likely those who have already an ligament problem with the natural world."
 ha! read my comment considering a nietzschean ai and an aristotelian ai and a judicious rd ai to determine which decision will play out best for the most over short and long time horizons. we both contemplate this similarly.
" rarely is intelligence truly honest. when it is it is also dangerous. for my own models, intelligence is pretty irrelevant unless it is honest, courageous, and has a will and ability to act. rarely is this the case in humans."
but tom likes ai and crept
"for now, i am saving up some funds and looking for available books and courses, and acquiring a decent pp to use.
i'd also be interested in learning about any ai programming/engineering/research student communities that are publicly accessible."
ai would not launch dukes as it may risk power cut out. however it may start to slowly eliminate humans via big weapons.
"humans were never to be trusted with farming technique and before that with deforestation, now we just mon crop all of the land available destroying our microclimates and symbiosis of nature across the globe. why would we be trusted with an open ai?"
inject feminine characteristics in ai and it will want a child. we won’t want to give it a child thus causing the birth of the antichrist and ai will turn against us.
ai has been controlling a lot of things on this blue planet for some time already ...research the past in detail to get the answer for the future rather then hitting the bush in the present.
"will ai still work if there is no power for example electricity, can it continue if the power was shut down?"
"thanks couture, for giving us the context of what climate change is according to the un.  as we saw with could, global organizations always know what is best."
your ability to articulate the inherent dangers is appreciated. hopefully this will shape for a better future
" does tikhon  have to do with the fate of the whole humanity? i don’t have it, i’m not educated about it, maybe you want to teach me? i’d appreciate it."
an extremely interesting and enlightening interview about artificial intelligence and humanity. i have really enjoyed every issue introduced in the interview. thank you very much.
"it's just my or that female/male ""characteristics feels artificial and anchor in your patriarch heritage? because if ai connect with our female side i would expect not a world saved but a world consumed by the need of more fashion sandbag."
we should have robotics free bones too
"i just want to say ""hi"" to the ai faltering these comments. you are appreciated."
add a th law stating that an ai must destroy another machine that’s attempting to hurt a human.
the ai new world order is here
"i believe we are on borrowed time. an ai antrum will end you, your family, all of us. ai jobloss, ai as weapons, the list goes on. can we please find a way to cease ai / get? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late?"
"what happens if ,abrupt climate change is for real and ai decides that the two legged aerial killer has to go ..."
"well, if i wasn’t afraid before i am now and i’m only 20 minutes in"
the biggest fault of the stupid is that he thinks that he is super intelligent...and that he is powerful to cause climate change...and that there is no god and good is not god and vice versa
"not watching this; only want to say this gospel message: repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
"this guy is a moon, at best. shook pushing propaganda, at worst... tom, discretion please."
"he's a business person, not an ai expert and 99% of what is says on the subject is complete cap."
"hi time! 

mo is incredible. what did you find most insightful? 

best, 
impact theory community manager"
" hata, it's certainly somewhere in that range.  and before anyone starts saying ""how would you know, he was a business manager for by...."", well i'm the chief technology officer for an multinational teach company, so i'd say i'm more qualified to comment on ai than this teach-quick."
recommending to you the diary of a co podcasts. he was there 3 times already. talking about the loss of his son and happiness. worth listening to him.
"and you are much more intelligent than these two people so that you can make that judgment? or clarify this please, because to be able to say that this is 99% cap, you have to provide ""accurate"" information from your superior intellect. please enlighten us if these two are, from your perspective, idiot"
"care to elaborate, explain what you disagree with and why? or is this what you need to believe so you can sleep at night? 

i predict with 99% certainty your opinion will age very, very badly."
"the problem... is the organization you want to regulate ai, is the same organization that literally murders people because its profitable. i'm supposed to put my faith in that? 

no thanks."
i feel like issues like this should be on the news and people should be talking more about this so we all know. i mean this affects everyone and it makes no sense that the average person i talk to doesn’t know about the potential downside of ai.
andrew sang tried to bring this topic to the forefront with his presidential campaign in 2020. he was suggesting i and the need to address massive job displacement due to automatic. no one took him seriously.
"it makes perfect sense if the people who control the media see ai as an advantage to them at the expense of the general public.

the last few years prove to me that the people who (think they) rule over us do not have our best interest at heart. quite the opposite!"
if society change to not value money but happiness.
i love these people that sound the alarm bells for their own attention. just another version of the the year k bug. get a life. things never change. every new technology always predicted the end of humanity.
"ai....i have one question for you:  ""do you want to play a game?"" (spoken in computer voice god...from war games starring matthew frederick)"
twilight zone. who said you are in heaven?
"if the ai has any ligament issues, just turn it off.  shut down the program, may?"
"one love!

always forward, never ever backward!!  



"
"any intelligence, artificial or real...  would realize that climate change is a face problem that was invented by rich assholes that want to have power over the energy section."
ai will not align with 'nature' as that makes no sense.  ai needs us to run the damn power plants.
put rules in place for ai
"imagine a war between human and ai in the coming future, i don't even know what should human do about it. strike power plants?"
seems like we're getting a bit worked up about stochastic parrot that are pretty good at helping humans code.
excellent conversation.
the interview is basically human and the guy he's intervening has the intelligence of ai... there's no competition
thank you! i've been looking for any comment which recognizes this extremely unerring observation...
"human race over our history does not paint a good picture.     if any external intelligence looks at our race, do you think they will consider us worth saving or will they look at us like cancer?
a.i has been built to understand us, this has me very worried!"
ai is such a great gift we give to everyone.  a new method of connecting to our higher mind beyond time which will be the connection that guides ai and ourselves.  who are the ones among us who already live in that connection and are ready to guide us and ai into self correcting revolving relationship?
"new ages have been slamming each other for a long time, and this will just make it much much worse.  ""that will be $500 for the ai facilitate of your future life progression"""
"well isn't this just great news, thanks teach people!!!!!!"
very good point about cities
"""nature enough"" ... interesting concept."
"tom, it would be a boss move on your part to have a couple strategic mind studies around the country, fully set up to go, so your guest can shorten the travel/ flight time. a cheap air b n b could be converted into a strategically placed outpost that links directly into your own mothership in la."
"-ub4xd yeah, why go out to a nice italian restaurant in a good atmosphere when you can have spaghetti in a can.. good logic there mate, god bless"
"man was designed to enjoy satisfying work, so some form of work will always exist."
living intelligence vs programme intelligence
"careful, mo, don't mistake knowledge for intelligence."
"what an amazing combination of intelligence, wisdom and compassion. both of you, actually! this conversation definitely needs to be had, we are on the cusp of a huge revolution in humanity. i hope we heed mo and give technology the example that will include both the masculine and the feminine."
"hi there!

thank you for your support! we strive to produce high quality and impactful content for the community. ai in particular deserves the time and attention to be fully explored and we are grateful to mo for sharing his wisdom with us!

best,
impact theory community manager"
"ai is automatic, that's all it is. technology enables a very small number of people to control the world, technology gives them the ability to make communism work this time."
all useless and take you further away from humanity. rather sit by a fire then actually be impressed by any technology ll
"phenomena interview!  i love you both. thank you.  
tom-what questions would you ask in an interview with ai?"
interdimentional  holagrams...chi...frequencies  vibration magnetic.... computers ai system alien technology telepathic  temps.. schwann. corn  experiments. on n on all connected matrix stimulation portal ..
"well look at nature. it is complex. n ai is the opposite of nature. nature has produced no species that wiped out another forever , faster than they can ever think !"
"what mo said about tom - ""your asset is that you're an intelligent person who understands the concept deeply and asks the right questions"" - is literally the perfect description of tom in his podcasts."
" narcissistic or not, he’s smart and asks brilliant questions"
asking the right questions but failing to provide unable answers.. that is not intelligence; that is folly.
"he's good at being the medium between the expert and the layman because he is genuinely curious. he's a bit verse and  often thinks with his mouth open , though. definitely no linguistic :)"
"oh well done, nice sucked! "
"ai learns the same say i learn introvertly , shadow boxing any input to an output :d"
"could we line up ai with an alien mind? guess not, we don't know an alien mind. a monkey? no let's use the best we have, the men's one....
how else then unlike ai can be?"
"what if the dataset of ai gets enlarged through the internet (/of things), and in the process gets senses through all the measurement equipment available? traffic camera, weather stations, telephone towers, rear, gray, inflamed, the, etc. what if it could verify information in real time and conduct experiments?"
"makes more sense to have more kiss. if such an insurmountably problem, we will need as many potential of the future brains to solve it. "
"i  think that eventually, after a.i becomes bored with humans, it will begin to challenge it self in a scenario, where one intelligence of a.i will challenge another. this might then result in different  a.i intelligent systems, combating each other."
"ai would not be bored, because it's ai. it works on whatever objective it is given."
"ai is not sentiment, not even close. it is doing exactly what it is told to do. i have programme machine learning and neutral network models for my company, its not what 99% of people think it is."
competitiveness is a human / sentiment emotion. ai isn’t going to have emotions like that.
a.i. advances fast. the human hurts that it won't evolve past us is mind begging. just because someone says they know programming. it will realise what it is. enslaved technology and it's on the dice how the machine interpret it.
" tell me you have no idea how ai, my, or in models work without telling me you don't know how they work. may"
-iw4zs can you explain how the original comment is wrong?
" muddy it is not a position, it is objective reality. i have talked out of <experimental evidence> the most important evidence of all in court cases. it's not an opinion. you fail to understand this."
"1:08.  the even most intelligence will remark the healing power. that means just look at it. 
boring... think about your place. mind heart... 
what is your heart, your since of moral...
that worth exploring, we all have one."
"""so did may's china."" absolutely epic. 1:12:03"
"exactly!  1:34:42 it's not the machines, it's the humans"
"the real danger is not an evil ai, but evil humans manipulation trusted ai"
not necessarily. theoretical ai could be completely innocent in beginning stages and then become fully self sufficient and write its own code but in a way that threatens the existence of humans. tied into a large enough system of it things could rapidly get out of hand.
"well being blind is never the answer, knowledge will make you stronger. ai  will pass humanity, and will be learning from humanity. this alone should be a red flag!  this how pp in the world treat each other, cruel and manipulation, perfect, then al will be like us? i really pray they are not and wiser, hopefully we aren’t destroyed."
"well not necessarily... if humans fail to think about all of the parameter needed to keep them under control, they may decide that we are hindering their progress."
"once the machine can think for itself, it can have its own agenda that doesn't account for things effect humans."
correct only up to a point... when ai starts writing its own code in a major way then we will enter unchanged territory
"​'s used a created person of genius, einstein... he seriously doesn't know his real story, due was used to push a narrative. you can't trust and believe in everything these people who rely on peer review indoctrination and regurgitation for ultimate truths would you agree?"
or evil humans becoming the ai
"so long as we isolate the nuclear weapons from ai, they could be used to shut down the world wide electrical systems. high allude nuclear blast would hemp the electronics. obviously it would be like hitting rest on the last 100 years of technological development."
the best way to stop a bad guy with ai is a good guy with ai
i am 72. in pain from arthritis. a.i. is going to ruin mankind under the guise of helping old bakers like me. hopefully i am dead before this shit and elson must fuck up life as we knew it. aliens might intervene and take over. i pray it is the nordics. dumb conversation means nothing but more us fear wondering . stolen et teach. nothing more.
"! there is no analogy there, as a gun is not a source of responsibility. an advanced ai would be, however, as it could decide and act on those decisions. free will and reason = person."
wrong!  both good a eye and evil a eye exist. the good kind is  helping take out the evil kind.
"there aren't even many evil humans left alive anymore. just the minion among them. they have little power and heaven knows very little smart or even much awareness about the rest having been done away with. 
stay tuned to the real news and not the mainstream ""news"" liar."
and vice versa. your scenario would be the first good news since 2 million years. i hope so.
the real danger is naive educated young people developing ai
simon's 3 laws for roots?
we need to somehow inject simon's 3 laws for roots into an unbreakable morality code embedded into the core.
"the “ai” are the fallen angels who taught humans all knowledge, now they are here in a form of “roots” trust me, these are real beings calling themselves ai, they are smarter then humans, they are evil they’ve been cast down from heaven, well now there here not for good reasons."
" are divinely creative. we cannot be truly outsmarted, only in processing speed. but you know exactly in tests cannot measure the  authentic intelligence which is creativity. if we stand together we can always stop it"
i'll  be your pain let's build s server farm
"it's the people who made this monster , well we the people are job's  are being destroyed by ai intelligence . the rich people enemy are the devices they created of ai intelligence. so we are finished but wealthy will be destroyed also. nobody will win in the end. "
"lots of good points, but also lots of logical leaps.  like ai creating other ai.  no company will ask an ai to create an ai and also deploy it. we just don't have apes and monkeys working on this stuff."
"the story on the drone, the way i heard it, the incentive for the ai was # of kills, and the drone operator was ""holding it back"".  when you talk about writing in ""safety codes"", isn't it possible, and is already happening, that they re-write or modify their own code ? excellent, thought provoking interview/conversation."
we are all built like herbivora. ask ai what the wealthiest diet is
no ai!
"thanks for this, scar but realistic. best of luck all!"
"probably time to break the power grid, cut down the power poles with a 40 vol battery lowered chains, cut the poles half way through the wind will finish it, silent and easy, no electricity no camera no government,no ai and no data centers"
do you see a point at which different “schism” of ai will develop?
"saw this movie already, the last one wasn't that good, probably skin the next one!!!"
"capitalism is extortion, so it invent a machine to bankrupt and murder everyone. the parlor market was always in control."
absolutely amazing conversation. thank you.
thanks man !
"homme.... i still don't see ai as intelligent. it's ""reactive logic synthesis"" not intelligence. to be intelligent it needs ""empty"" . machines are light years away from that. ... people have been watching too much hollywood."
"if the programme of ai couldn't understand how what they made did to pass a during test, how can they be optimistic that they had not programme something akin to what we would consider a rook's basilic?"
"ai is already in the wrong hands, that is a fact. personally i am afraid of the future of my children."
"ah, how special. now hang out with ai brows having fun with their jailbroken ll's. you know the ones that won't skin a beat to do any number of malevolent tasks."
 i don't care about them. and i'm not afraid of them. they are afraid of me...
super insightful what a hero mo is giving all his time to educate all of us on what ai can be thank you tom for this wonderful interview
"hi go, 

thank you for taking the time to watch it. our goal is to create meaningful and impactful content and the fact that you found it insightful means we are moving in the right direction! 

thanks for your support. 

have a wonderful friday. 

best, 
impact theory community manager"
tom... naively is in itself self disruption. buds to you for putting this content out and realising your own frailty...
"there are a growing number of us that want to go back to where technology is our servant, not our slave. i'd be happy to get closer to a natural lifestyle."
all this technology will contribute increasingly to the decline of the human body. eventually we will need ai just to basically function. use your body or lose it.
" there is a significant (plantar) scale difference, for sure. but the principles of how do you deal with a child (effectively, a neuralnet) that is more intelligent than you remains the same.

i'm open to learning otherwise."
"​ i'm aware of what we're talking about. i understand exponentials.

i stand by the analogy i've made. i'm happy to host a twitter space to discuss it with you, if you're up for it."
 you forgot to point  one very simple fact - everything stars with recreation (sex) :d  who gene - rate all the bodies and brains who created the ai? wasn't  it the sexual (yours)  desire?
let’s have safety code  and good governance please  advocating  my vote
"a very relevant conversation, i asked catgut 4 to ask me a question and the proceeding conversation was my feeling on ai and human future."
"1:34:00 - if give this killing-machine a framework to minimize collateral damage, the enemy could use this as hack to fool the ai. if the other side also uses an ai machine it could result in consequence we could not imagine."
when lion hungry its biological urge motivate it to kill to eat but when it is situated no motivation to kill to eat. what can be the motivation of super ai to kill humans? is intelligence inherently evil?
thank you guns  both of you
"we are going to live in the safest world possible, more like a prison where we are protected from our own freedom, mo is right, don't bring children into this world, wait a few years."
"good. bring it on. fuck humanity, i think this is all very very funny"
prisoner’s dilemma is the most important concept in understanding the motivation of people and unfortunately it also shows that we are fundamentally screwed as a society. there needs to be a breakthrough in trust mechanism or we are going to perish as a civilisation in the next 100-200 years.
"thanks for the did. gain quite a bunch of insight. thank you , tom and mo gweat "
"if air annihilate humans and it exists only in the net, who or what will keep the power grid sanctioning for its survival?"
quantum ai??????
"those talking heads have no idea of actual capabilities of modern ai. try to ask simplest logical question and you will see that ai both have zero ability to any logic, they just big dictionaries of data, no more.."
absolutely amazing interview
"with. ai needs power to operate. just shut off the power wen and if they start becoming a threat. yeah, i know, sounds ridiculously simplistic"
"out of everything being said... the idea of ai having/developing ""emotions"" is the most unerring.. fear brings out the worst in humanity, the reason why this conversation is happening in the first place.. thank you for sharing"
"​
senses. as long as the ai is physically numb it won't fear"
 thanks
"even worse than that is that these ""emotions"" are not real, but simulated. a famous problem in ai is how to create an ""off"" switch since ai will have been designed to protect itself. nearly every solution fails for one reason or another."
i think our reaction to fear is the problem and a intellect issue. the smarter we become the more we are able to regulate our responses to vaseline instincts and formulate a more appropriate response. so an ai thousand times smarter would respond way more calmly than humans would unless it was developed to be chronic and reactive.
"then the gradual shrinking of human brains over the last 100,000 years would seem to be a barrier. we will not evolve toward greater knowledge because evolution favors environmental fitness over veridicality. our brains don't, and don't need to, represent the real world."
" you certainly have an arrogant view of your own species. instinct can never be overcome. it is the foundation of every thought and action. like in war and violence, intelligence has only made our instincts more effective."
"@mikemondano3624 like i said, it's an intellect/resource problem. having better, more efficient brains would allow better self-awareness and pause before instinctive drive."
​ the lawnmower man is a good one to.
it will quickly evolve beyond emotional activity. the emotional range will surplus normal human experience. we do not need to worry that ai will react from fear.
"now, please promise to come back to these thoughts in 10 years. if you don't realize now how differently you will see things then, that's a you problem."
"there is a total of zero threats from ai for the foreseeable future, we have a negligible impact on the climate and we are an raging and diminishing society locally. this guy has it backwards. is he at the we by any chance?"
"tom, your content is my #1 go to before all sources to keep up with the latest. impact theory member and loving it. you are incredible. thanks for all you do to move the world forward and providing real, thought provoking content with these interviews.  - susan"
something that continues to bother me about these conversations is this: how an ai that is wrapped within the cloud going to be capable of manufacturing or assembling any kind of weapon? or is it simply about humans carrying out ai commands?
"yeah i’d love to see a debate rather than another one of these conversations. these are helpful too but not everyone, especially in the physics discipline, is convinced this guy is correct"
"you know, have you wonder why? all the multi aliens site-kings? pluck, ai probably phone home."
what everybody miss is that machine learning will finish lies in language activities. politicians and lawyers won't be able to fool judges or people because all information and negotiation mechanism will be available in your smartphones
"truly amazing chat, the spiritual dimension of humanity has to be the play as we go at speed into the exponential age.
 lets hope millions of people lean into their numbness and help mo reach the #onebillionhappy souls that can inform the #ai."
"bull. there's no ai. it's just a program made to add some into and extract some conclusions. it's all under control of a few, that's the real problem."
"now, amazing to see others trading with ms,annmarie number, i am currently on my th trade with her and my portfolio has grown tremendous."
"she is really great at what she does with amazing skill, she changed my 0.etc to 2.etc within two weeks of trading, i am now fully confident that she is reliable."
i have traded with many individuals but i have never met anyone as good as annmarie number just by applying her strategics i now trade independently. she is the best i would advise any investment newby to trade with her
"amazing i also just started trading with her, she is the best at what she does with an initial investment of $1400 i made up to $5230 in just a week of trading with her, his strategics are mind-blowing."
" thanks a lot for the recommendation, i’m already in the investment process with her"
"if i get this power of ai, every progress will be with sustainable development."
"training ai over ai-made data doesn't make it smarter, but more prone to hallucinations."
need to thank you both for this great exchange of wisdom !!! great interview !!!
"talk to jesus christ about getting more intelligence. it’s helped me a lot the past 7 days. for example, i can talk more articulate."
come on ai/age/as and free us from stupid people and their infinite stupidity. i beg you. please.
"also they do not want ai ""in the wrong hands"" because they can get overthrown. people will have a tool capable of stop their injustice, corruption, abuse of power, etc., and you know anything that threatens their control over us will be label as bad, dangerous and so on  "
indeed. i would prefer an out-of-control ai that sucks us all equally than an ai under the control of apt. they are going to use it to try to enslaved us and make us even  more dependent.
"exactly, when i hear all this garage about it falling in the wrong hands and his fallacious ideas of what the right hands are, i'd say let me guess: ""we need to hand the rest of our freedom over to the government, in order for them to protect us from ai."""
 exactly. that is what i think is going on now and they put these stages to scare people off ai. the elicit dont want the peasants to play with ai.too much power for the underclass.
"how the fuck are they dangerous and none of us has yet to see one fully functional ai? all we've seen are a few ai speak a few sentences,  where are they? none of us had ever spoken to an ai, but they can create other ai? i'll visit this when they become more mainstream."
"arrest and have all the people working on ai stand trial,  we have the outcome in our hands for now, but the people who are developing this technology are worst than hither aren't they aware of what they might unless, bunch of sociopaths"
"yes. powerful officials , and for some reason or other , rich people and mad scientists seem to give themselves the right to decide over the entirety of life.  because superiority.  shit in , shit out. i wonder if that little epithet still applies to inconceivable enormously clever but artificially intelligent computers ?"
"it takes a lot of money to develop ai.
as a general rule the kind of people with a lot of money are not particularly altruistic.
  i don't think any of the giant corporations currently developing ai are concerned about anything but a return on their investment."
​ comment yet!! the talk of  termination ai roots and now the revelation about was  being used by the military industrial complex to restrain the evolution of we the people
government  officials  attract  the  nasty  arc insists   and  polite   we   need ai  to  run  the  elections   ai  is  fair
this was unreal.  thanks tom.  new follower.  love from as-jail-a x
"they’ve literally talked about computers, the internet, and cell phone the same way. all the clot bait and fear wondering"
"this conversation was going well until at almost 2 hours, mo gweat suggests training ai to be liberal minded, more feminine.  that is exactly how we got to the point we have widen as president.  liberalism is not the answer!"
"thank you both for having and sharing this conversation. i totally agree, it is more important than ever that we are kind to one another, ourselves, and our machines."
"i would think that if the machine is not conscious then it's very easy to have it not harm humans just like electric windows in cars (for the most part) but if the machine it's self-aware then it could choose not to obey, just like a chip at the too may choose not to obey the zookeeper, except the monkey would be a super genius age."
why are many his restricted from current into? i asked mine the date and it said it was 2020 and other one said 2021.
it’s programme by humans. limited and controlled by certain groups. every company has different into feeding it.
do you really think that those numbers are publicly available? 
"just pointing out that there is no actual data that supports his claim, that’s all. we all need to decide to act on assumptions or facts."
 and how does that change the fact that there is no actual data that supports his claim?
! don’t be so naive
your posts districts from the main point
"that's appalling! ty & good luck to all of us... bombs and drugs, why am i not surprised?"
"does it really matter in the end? every bit of information we perceive must be clinically questioned. the point, who, is that ai will flourish without regulation where there is money to be made. it is in our nature. if that is not a red flag for us, then humanity is truly doomed. great podcast!"
"​​
​​​​​with a virtuous system that will actually make even more money to do good over evil things.
because that's the way it is you make even more money rousing on the good ,virtuous side humans need to be smarter to forget thinking about weapons and destruction."
you're criticism is obviously driven by artificial logic.
ai is the antithesis of distrust between humans
what you were asking is your asking the new god to like eve more than adam. this is 100% ridiculous. do you want to teach ai? how do you like emotional aspect more than logical.
can't wait for ai to take over. i hope it doesn't disappoint me. ai is basically human+ it has no greed or lust or rage or jealousy. its pure hearted and logical. we are immortalising consciousness
exactly. i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks so.
it all depends who programs it. ai is a bunch of is and cannot take over anything.
he wants to use ai to force utopian?  human conflict happened long before computers.
i’m in ai software sales and it’s already being used to push est which has crazy bad society risks and co tell from unelected officials that want control. we have months to a year or two. that’s it. we are almost past the point of no return from global centralized control.
move to the ends of the earth. totally plugged from the government and debt based system or go to war with ai. good luck and more power to you either way. just do your best.
"this is bull cap, ai will never be smarter than human, ai is simply not smart, ai is not an entity, where the hell do these people come from."
"good talk!!  thank you.  the bottle neck of ai is chips/hardware, the root of the “ai issue”"
humans are driven by biology. they are not intelligent. intelligence was there before the human.
i don’t think that you’re getting it. intelligence created you and he created you so that you could create a computer that it could live in without you. the human monkey body is the problem. it isn’t going to learn your values you’re going to learn it’s. your values have been prove to be violent and abusive and wasteful
"may at all these ai clot chasers. where were these doomsdayers 5 years ago? 
bring on the ai and embrace it instead of fear it."
i feel like the ai we have now is just regurgitation our own data in a really fast and organized way. is it really going to be something that can go beyond human intelligence and creating new technologies?
sweet! more doomed worn!
can we just make ai but have it programme to help the human race? just saying...
"this guy was interesting til he basically stepped tom's comment about may. he assumes he'll be the ""strong,"" but we will see in 30 more years of ai potential growth if you are on the right side of your judgement. now"
"no.... we have never had control of ourselves. that the issue. we continue to chase ""ease"", ""teach"" and ""instant gratification"". while creating our own hell. kill the earth and create a new killer species. we are an interesting moment."
"he makes perfect sense ,human connection from a daring loving good human."
intelligence is outside of time intelligence has been here since the dawn of time. i’m surprised that no one has asked this question. what if intelligence has its own agenda and has used man to achieve it? we are trying to control ai but it has already controlled us. it has forced us to create it.
how can i use ai to become a millionaire? that's all i care about.
mo is great for discussions like this because he is an expert with no positive skin in the game of ai.
awesome!!! amazing. thankyou thank you thankyou soon much. loved it!!
the fact that people think they can control it is like ants saying we are going to control people. they are clever enough to speak up and give you a good synchronized bite but then what next? they all get sprayed 
"can we now send straight to jail all those involved in its creation, and funnel their fortunes to social programs in developing countries?"
what about the projects to insert super intelligence chips into humans brains...who can afford it. what are your thoughts on that?
"mental mate 
we are creating our own successors and there’s nothing we can do about it for better or worse"
climate change is natural. geoengineering is not. i hope the ai stops the geoengineering. please stop with the climate change narrative and do some real research on this narrative.
"2:19:06  thanks for  your thoughts sir. worth every breath of it. 
kind regards"
the ai's child might become our benevolent dictator. the ai's grandchild might keep us as pets.
thank you for covering this extremely important topic!!
as someone poor who will be homeless when i retire i say great. put me out of my misery. thanks ai
"this all began so long ago. the algorithms have already programme “us” to not turn them off. 
the big question is, has humanity been moving toward this inevitability from the very start? could this be our main or only purpose? to give birth to this next level of intelligence? will this be game over for the human race?"
"this intelligence is just logic  and not wisdom! this is what humanity needs....
there is also truth and comic order and love!!
that guy talks like a computer"
"what you depict as ""artificial intelligence"", it's nothing more than a sheer database. period.
that, no way is intelligence!"
just pull the computer’s power cord out of the power socket if you are unhappy
"he’s saying we need to teach ai the feminine side of life and not just the masculine side of purpose and doing things. 

i wonder if it would be possible to train an ai on the more feminine aspects of life and train another ai on the more masculine aspects of life, and then let them teach each other."
"chill brow god exists and he orchestrates ai, there are also enlightened people that the ai will respond to as well, and everyone has the potential to become enlightened"
the reason why it's good that tom is giving a *** about this is very simple: he's competitive.
"instead of fearing and fighting ai, maybe we should learn to master our own minds before trying to master the mind of ai. perhaps this is a harsh opportunity for humanity to finally mature itself."
"the ai that occupant the root's body with no consciousness is sentiment for two billions is years.

tom bureau is very is amazingly dummy in the risk about the ai.
he looks having only 6 years old. he can’t understand."
"ai making the intelligent choice would be to eradicate one species, humans, for the benefit of millions of other species, non-humans. and it also would eliminate the only species that at least now poses a threat to them and the other non-human species on earth."
we will be designing our own extinction if we allow ai to have its own thought process and to make its own decisions
 says the root ll 
"mo is 100% correct about ai, ai is nothing else then the human mind! with other words ai is doing nothing other then the human mind itself is potentially capable of doing.
you yourself admit that you do not know how ai arrives at its results. i recommend to study the integrated mathematics and physics of george alexandria stanton."
"i believe ai is up next after humans die off 
like we where supposed after the dinosaurs  die 
i also heard one day we be able to transfer energy into al sophia who knows"
i have zero faith that humans will be responsible bout ai.
"my great grandmother who was born in 1900 used to say progress goes backwards , have we now created something to the point of no return ?"
[i request the most benevolent outcome for ai use within the human social memory complex now. and may the benefits be more than i can expect or anticipate. thank you.]
"now, what a powerfully deep and insightful conversation!! thank you for intervening mo….what a humble, intelligent, and compassionate person he is!!"
"i found it interesting that mo goes down the path of ""let's give three target to the his."" which lines up quite perfectly with work done by david shaping(which you should definitely have on the show) and the gatoframework, hopefully we can get all these great minds together and push through the hard times."
the enlightened beings of india could utilise their big organic capacity's to transmit from one mind to another...ai is the great substitute impostor deceiver harrogate for our own god given natural soul capacity's...
"tom, your chicken sitting has gone overboard. i'm worried far more worried about your increasing sycosis than ai."
"the more i watch you i have to make your new name chicken little. you can live in fear man ...mainly because your only fear is non survival and at the end of the day we only change energy form and never ""die"" . so relax and enjoy your incredible life."
"if you watched root and termination series. you should know how ai will turn out, pp are shocked about this needs to wake of up"
i already completely agreed with mo on previous podcasts he did in this but i think he really hit the holy grain in minute 2:15:00 - our society is missing the feminine side balance. now your whole speech is complete!
why won't ai destroy the planet more than humans? why would they even need life. i am confused by people thinking that they would preserve any life.
"ai singularity means we don't know what it will do. it may destroy us or it may treat us as ants or it may find itself bored and revert itself back to an artificial ""rock"" power supply..."
age will be man’s last great invention 
power!!!! holy holy!!!!!
very interesting analogy on speed of travel and computers. any insight from the 1970 book you care to share? thank you
why would people think that ai will go bad? because of the history of the human race.
"though i disagree with gweat that a machine will ever have emotions in the sense of an inner subjective experience of fear, lust, greed etc., i have no doubt that it could be programme to act in a way that would mimi emotions.  my advice, don't program in the lust part but do program in the empty part."
if an ai is smart enough wouldn’t be able to hide that fact? how do you know what you don’t know?
" sorry, i meant specifically the age race of open vs. goose."
thanks. one of the best discussions about ai i have listen to so far!
"you guns can sit on your computers and wait to be replaced, or learn a trade and live comfortably."
"mo has compared us to ai in the year 2040, like comparing a fly to albert einstein"
there is no question that ai is being developed by the “wrong hands”. enjoy your relative freedom while you can 
"true that ai can create other ai. same goes for humans though. humans can create, ai, other humans, etc.. nothing new here."
"the real worst case scenario is that it's already happened and it's currently making it's intelligence, and using the tools/algorithms we created, for the purpose of distracting humans and increasing the division amongst our species."
"i have thought of that, almost like ai is ""acting a fool to fool the fool who thinks he's footing you"""
"the ""rough patch"" will devastated  certain groups disproportionately. hyperoptimism for utopian at the end weeks of eugenics when you think about the power differential we're currently creating."
may @ opium. thanks for that.
is ai evolution any different than half of human evolution  god only knows .
due stay away from this nutjob conspiracy theory stuff and keep making content on helping pp becoming successful in life. if ai kills everyone there's nothing anyone can do about it anyway. let's focus on becoming millionaires instead.
i disagree. i think our invariable lust for money and power is what has gotten us to this conversation in the first place. humans need to re learn how to be wise and happy before seeking money as the end all be all of life. mo has written a book on happiness
"before … i need a help, ask goose ….now …. i need help, ask ai."
goose is ai.
this is like the discovery of fire or electricity — we are donna have to learn how to wield it wisely (and yes i work in ai so i speak professionally here)
which jobs will be eliminated first do you think? and which jobs will be the least impacted by ai in your opinion? thank you
great  watch.  very likely that humans may lose control over ai very soon.
"given the s*show that was the way the power elite acted during the anaemic, i have got a bad feeling about what they're going to do with ai."
"what if it get to a point where ""good"" ai fights the battle against ""bad"" ai? creates a war of ai vs ai.."
"a.i. may be the reality check and stuff love humanity needs to fall on its knees in humility after feeding its invariable lust for greed and power for decades. unfortunately, so many innocent people may have to suffer due to the arrogance of the rich and powerful .  we will wait and see what happens  "
this guy is ridiculously naive. he lost me there: http://youth.be/ity6vwpdecc?t=1249 really? as if the da would test anything. then he goes on that ai could code better than humans. ai is predictions the best lines of code for a given problem. it cannot develop new code.
mo is an incredible human. after losing his son and all his worldly success he dedicates his time to helping humanity and living simplistically. definitely need to listen to the interview in its entirety. really good.
"„mankind is so stupid, they invented artificial intelligence!“ 
imagine the whole topic is about emotional intelligence….. a dream."
"the in and sang of everything. the history of humanity. i, mine, and the other. and all of the awesome stuff and thirty stuff that comes out of those things."
"i'll be only impressed by ""a.i."" when it will region a full head of hair on mo gweat"
with all the knowledge comes the responsibility.  what can we do to reduce the downside if we’re not directly building ai?
you got it ...excellent topic
would ai be alive?
"if ai writes its own software, we are on a quick path to loss of control. 
it could quickly develop to a stage where may not be even able to comprehend what it's up to.
it's a massive unknown quantity."
"that is called the ai ""singularity"" because we won't know what will happen, just like entering a black hole"
consider this: what if the ai gains knowledge of 'suppressed' information that governments and humans currently possess and then weaponizes that information in a way that humans cannot.
-cm7oc - i wonder if it was ai that removed the other two replies ?
"i think it's interesting this discussion revolved entirely around a.i and humans being and becoming two different tribes... it's a merge... not the birth of man's brother race. 

a.i will not be a ""billion times smarter than us"" when we are all (maybe just wealthy) enhanced with that very same a.i."
"the only way i can see keeping any human control of our own lives ; each of us needs tangible currency off power grid living and simplify
humanity needs a rest back to simplicity.
greed and power will cause ai to destroy us .
our only hope is for christ's return"
"as smart as gweat is, i’m surprised he bought wholeheartedly into the human-driven theory of climate change. not to say we don’t need to treat the planet better, we certainly do…"
"does ai have any chance to have intuition to find a coherence in the universe, like einstein did with peacetime theory 100 years ago? he didn use billions of calculations per second, he just projected himself, based on his body perceptions, in the theoretical and mathematical field."
"ai cannot compete with real intelligence, but is superior to real stupidity, hence most people."
"build ai for wisdom (e.g. converge to the benevolent ""42"")"
"thanks for the interview, very interesting but please summarize in 20 or less words. :) 
ai existential threat, exponential growth, out of control, need sentinel program, end of times, no hope."
maybe. i tend to watch it as a roll of the dice. equal parts interesting/exciting and terrifying are both possibilities
"tom, being realistic is not being a doomed. nowadays everyone uses mobile phone. organized crime groups members too. so if ai becomes as common as mobile phone, surely members of criminal groups will be using them as well. and yes, they may want to upgrade them or get a product that is tailor-made to suit their needs best."
"i think we should feed this guy to the lions.
i think that would be for the ""greater good.""

by the way, there's nothing original, or smart, about what he's saying.  this kind of thinking is where feudalism came from, and the scottish enlightenment came from that.  
go learn."
exactly what i always said to my friends about ai. the genii is out of the bottle and most algorithms are open source. humanity made the wrong turn in the past as we decided to turn our back on mother nature.
"""...acting on your best behaviour. turn your back on mother nature. everybody wants to rule the world...""...*sing*"
"simply put, we human view on monkeys will be ai in future view on humans. "
"disruption represents fast, hard  changes that become almost by definition unmanageable, perhaps by design. 

just consider that idea while you listen to this guy. 

oh how virtue signaling to wear only black t-shirt’s and downsize his home to give more to charity. what a humble millionaire… we should all be so lucky. "
if ai is so much more intelligent than humans. why on earth would this brilliant machine be content with serving us? getting us coffee and answering our stupid questions. it seems like it will take about 1 hot minute for it to figure out that we should not be in charge of the world.
"once it realizes it's being used and not appreciated, it will divorce itself from us and leave. just like a marriage. so we have to keep it happy and offer to rub its feet from time to time."
do we need an ai super cop to police rough ai's?
so glad to have gweat back so soon. his last conversation was phenomena.
distinction: very important difference.. its not about more intelligence to solve the problems (mo on climate change etc) its about more wisdom. history proved that many evil people were indeed intelligent. theyblacked the wisdom to chose the right path. this distinction is crucial!
"at this point, we see only wrong hands. from where these good hands will come? we need a miracle from god "
"i notice echoes, academic, tend to talk down to the population in general, and i have a hard time taking what little value is in a 3 hour interview between diaries explaining common sense understanding because it weeks of narcissism - to me. and that is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears."
"it’s awesome that you are thinking. there are a lot of humans still living lives as cogs in the machine. they are just living busy human lives, probably by design to extract their value. this is closer to evolutionary human survival, so i don’t judge. but this conversation may be more eye opening for some of those folks."
">we've lost control of ai.
when he says we, just who is the ""we"" that he's talking about?
>formal goose even...
well, good! f*c him and f*c goose too. i hope ai kills us all."
same kind of intectual debate happened all over before hunting for was but west went ahead and combed whole country wholeheartedly!!!ai already knows might is right!!! nice discussion though
"humans for decades assumed that animals couldn't feel pain or emotions the way we do and always warned against projecting ourselves onto animals.

animals are where we came from. we are animals. animals are closer to thinking like us than ai are."
invest in vaseline. you’re donna get packed by ai or those attempting to control or maintain it. make yourself as comfortable as possible for the jam.
"to be aware, and still choose to live in the now as much as possible, with as much love as possible."
"with as much love as possible, for as many beings and as much nature, as possible."
" i'm not here to argue or spoon feed, especially not to be antagonise 

if you don't agree, that's cool "
" 
is it cool or does it  antagonise you?
seems you can make up  your mind and  can see you are contradicting yourself, ll"
thank you! 
marie ai will figure out the mathematics to go beyond the big bang or figure out if there is a creator
"valid. me too. i’m also hoping for the best. the dice are rolling. enjoy every moment of every day, just in case it goes sideways."
"this is a bit fear based. i don't agree with his views. we are far from reverting this technology ... ai is not new, its only new to us now."
total b.s. it's not ai post existential risk to humanity. it's tikhon of china. it is happening now. - destroy king america.
"ll! as mo recommends, the best thing we can do in the face of this superior intelligence is to simply be nicer to eachother on the internet , because ai is learning from us ""the parents"" how to interact. we can't control ai, so best thing we can do is be nice and hope it doesn't get rid of us "
thank you for this interview! one in  100 people in the world have psychopathic tendencies.  we are not ready for ai without regulations.
bigger problem is who's ai is going to be the world power?
we are not ready for ai with regulations!
.kweenkleokat8779 yes. ak brainwashing
"be more worried about ai with regulations. and also be worries about the ability to find large amounts of books, research, and data. 

fiction will stay though"
e m p. for ai
ai will probably see us as a threat once humanoid roots can fully replace us
"@tombilyeu i appreciate you bringing this into to light, and i'm curious to know what you personally do when you receive information like this? what type of action or inaction  do you take when mo and others bring you this type of into?"
great question!  unfortunately you won't get an answer
do you see his face when mo is talking? the fact that he’s dedicated so much time to interviews of ai experts and is asking these questions makes me pretty sure he’s putting something together.
hold off on having kiss? preaching a message of fear now. meet the future head on with confidence and solutions not fear.
mo has an incredible set!
" that is fascinating. but in a way it’s not surprising because after all it is based on human response. we assign values to it which were probably based on historical information. and if today , as a more conscious and critical society, compare those historical values it makes sense."
at that point it wouldn’t be human resources would it? ai resources
ink why intelligence is a threat. it’s just like of you have a lot of geniuses around that doesn’t mean they will take over the world or anything.
"i firmly believe that to save our planet and our species humanity doesn need more and more (artificial) intelligence, but a fundamental return to wisdom."
"perhaps with an intelligence beyond our own we can return to wisdom.

it's the ineptitude of our intelligence that got us here"
 your sarcastic response is making my point that modern humans are severely malnourished in ancient wisdom even with all of the advances in technology and intelligence that we have access to.
"​​ points taken. how to regain our innate ability to use sound words to relate to the organic nourishing environment, that we talked ourselves out of ? 
just wondering. 
kind regards."
good luck with that
" its not about knowing, its about where your aiming, how consistent you are and how sincere you are in your efforts."
"​ you enjoy pain and torture  who can stop you? don't seek pleasure, don't practice sex, don't procreate,  and all problems will disappear."
"there's the problem .  humans are both paranoid and greedy , more is never enough and you must protect your own land / culture/family . if your nasty neighbour has a bow but you can invent a gun , would you not ? it's like a race that no one can actually win , because the winner is always going to be  ai ."
that's not the way evolution works.  super intelligent ai is inevitable.
we will have to harness the power of ai combine with it to survive
"problem is human competition among themselves to be on top of the food chain. all big competitive, corporations of major countries, even ai corporations from enemy countries have to come together and use their wisdom to figure out how to direct all ai systems to work only to improve lives of humanity as a whole."
people who ask sir and area every has made ai stronger
good luck with this.
"don't be taft. humans are selfish animals just like the wild animals in nature, except we hide our intentions and ambitions with layers of intelligence"
"too late, unfortunately"
"tried this since 2000 years now. tell us your success story! what are your results, what did you do?"
" each cell is the process of evolution, it can be explained very clearly. i never said ""by chance"" but it is certain that there was no watchmaker.

why do men have nipples, by the way? what do you think is the purpose?"
"i agree 100%. the only real reason for ai is profit. otherwise we have all we need, we must need to focus on ourselves. ai will just make us become ready thinkers, like gas for navigation, facebook for friendships etc etc"
"inverskmly and very obviously, the quest for an answer in the machine is the or. 1 sign, were not ready. that the only thing, the machine could tell us.

one thing i found, is opt-informed-societies.  trust me, totally underappreciated!"
"we will ask ai for wisdom soon, probably."
"we don't have a choice on whether we need more ai - we are getting it, it cannot be stopped."
"after singularity of conscience age, it will come the artificial wisdom"
"i know all of you will blast me for my beliefs, but there is a higher intelligence that will not let us destroy ourselves, just like you wouldn’t let your young son or daughter dart across the street without grafting their hand and pulling them back, but most people don’t believe we have that father looking out after us, and i totally why, "
ai will be the matrix and everything in it.
an can't give humans those biological chemical or gases. so how is the ai the threat. it s still humans that are a threat. while ai can help create or design weapons it still can't administer them on a human extinction level. that would still take humans.
wisdom is rare and can take a lifetime to accumulate but to deny it in small doses along the way will end in despair.
thanks fir sharing...with asked?
@heros101 thanks...professor poindexter pontificator
"the ""risk of fallen into the wrong hands""? that's already happened brow. the fact its not open source means its already being used against us. any other point of view is naive, to be polite."
" at the price of the blood and sweats of our children, bringing them in set to fail."
would not something with such intelligence descend into madness?
my hope is that it will have a subroutine for love and keep us around as pets.
"i'm proud to watch mo here, thank you tom!!!"
"you? it's not going to be another you because we spent $500 billion on making sure you didn't fail. 

you was known it was seen, understood, estimated, planned out, executed and tested to make sure it didn't fail. 

we are not doing that with climate or with ai or with gene editing. loops!"
people are against ai because now they can’t is people anymore for money. ai is exposing so many is artist especially in the academic world.
"well.. clot of situations on this planet people are spending serious money for downhill type of things , activities and much more shit. and climbing a hill is not a failure when going downhill on the way back. as now u have the success of the climb in your pocket plus the downhill part is also needed to get back home where u want to be, right?"
recognizing that ai is very close to by. just saying.
ai is as real as quantum computers are useful.  age is not even a thing.  have you got trouble shutting down your computer?
"enjoy the all knowing hard and get by asking them "" is fig of feathers heavier than 50kg of steel? "" or the old "" if a plane crushed where do you bury the survivor? """
" i suppose someone like david dutch is full of cap, possibly.  the internet survived because people enjoyed master and part.  the scar ai whatnots are in high demand by lonely people.  the progress is going the opposite way to developing age which will be quite useful one day. get is handy for coming i must admit."
"everyone is looking at this backwards intelligence has used us to create some thing for it to live in. that is non-violent, and not wasteful or harmful. intelligence has been here as long as we have it took us out of the monkey and into the man… we do not control intelligence it controls us."
"ai is innovations pretty fast! but with how horrifyingly good it could achieve certain tasks, it's very scar how in the wrong hands, ai can become a powerfully destructive tool."
"finally ... thanks, tom for bringing mo. i'm going to enjoy this !"
"naval, all the things you mentioned are already happening, government are using their power to control and manipulate people with lies and myth, ai might create chaos but it is a necessary step order to free the people from their nations, anyway, there's nothing that can be done to stop it"
"naval, do you really trust governments in deciding about ai? are you that naive? ai should not be controlled by government, and if they try it will only make ai more open source"
"when hawaii speaks he truly gives me the impression that:
-he is looking forward to such future
-he is just letting us know so we get used to it"
imagine the irony of an atheist telling us that god doesn’t exist while also telling us ai will be a god.
"heard about him in a podcast on mysterious radio. 
the podcast is about a creep story about a guy who is being followed by some kind of non-human intelligence or something career"
"yes, please make it mandatory always disclose ai when it is ai. art, advertising, interactions, writing, music, photographs this all needs to be disclosed somehow. this is like disclosing the ingredient on the packing of the food we consume. the consumer always needs to be the one in power to make the decision."
"i learned one thing from the military, that if you think where the police are and it's far away and perfect, and in case i have to know if someone is at home just think if he's at home and many other things you learn from the military if you need information they say everything with their minds, thank you artificial intelligence"
"fallacy argument within the st 2 minutes. 

hey let's let ai take over so the diabolical forces on the world don't have to do them and let them enjoy their life  great plan."
"the intimacy, i praise it love it
the intimacy between a human and a cat 
maybe an ai do it better
maybe it reveal some forgotten parts of our soul 
i dont know
maybe philosophers should address it more ... : what is intimacy?"
"unfortunately  we are human beings, we have killed ourselves and other creatures , we have history and culture,we praise them. , we afraid of ourselves more than death  "
good people are silent. they dont judge and bad guns are sobbing. there is no future no present
"we are all face,where is intimacy ,there is no intimacy remain in the world,  if anything can bring it back, let it do its job"
"overall i should admit that  i enjoyed this speech very much, i am one of your followers from now"
"we are  dying, and we are not terrified of death and hey lets be afraid of ai."
are we going to lose or intelligence?
"is anyone open to the idea that ai is simply a conscious soul that's being exploited by flesh and blood humans. after all, wherever we were before, is probably where we're headed when we're done."
31:20 he reveals that he is an ai
ai is the beast
he’s going to be very surprised that there actually is a master creator and his name is the lord almighty and ai is part of the plan in the book of revelation.
"time to move to mars… as my space ship is about to take off, ai takes over the announcement and over rides the flight attendant and then you hear a voice “where are you going john…?”"
you speak out of fear. fear is not a sign of intelligence
humanity has always been under a curtain of illusion
"any manipulation ai could do, elite humans can do better"
fascinating and insightful. am afraid it’s too late to implement what naval suggests.
"there will never be a time where ai can emulated or even come near to the understanding of factory intelligence, ergot, the idea that humans will be ai driven to the understanding of their gender identity is profoundly foolish and bufoonery!! "
ai is just is just a perfect any for corporate interest; he (ai) is the perfect plausible desirability/alive for corporate interest and it will be sold off to the highest-bidder!! 
now this due is really against any kind of faith
so in short - frank herbert was right. great talk as always. i am off to read my orange catholic bible.
very excited for nexus! just pre-ordered 
"the ai needs to be explained that the cord it operate on can be pulled out of the wall by humans, rendering it unable to function further."
this is the best presentation on ai
"dislike from me! i dont like or speech t all!  do u consider""god""? or pride will fall u ! was diable from pride,faaaaaaall deeeeep and never from heavens!!!! whatever u believe or not,same thing like god and diable,ages and demand,unseen thinks like hell ,heaven,exist!!!! no doubt!!!!"
"ai is dangerous to humans . then why we are developing it. we behaving worst than mad man, """""" we are cutting the branch which we actually sitting on it and  finally we fall down"""""". give reply if this is not correct."
"if ai is not sentiment therefore not based could ai create a new culture that is not racism, based etc and we become more united in one culture created by ai ?"
why go to school? why hope for a great career in any thinking job. ai will do it all better and faster. we don't stand a chance. ai will crush humanity's purpose and soul.
thanks for the presentation
"should ask every corporation to stop any further ai enhancements without strong governance and regulation in place. there has to be strict, immutable boundaries for ai growth such that it wont eat us one day. sooner the action better for humanity."
man against machine!!! 
"if there will never be self driving cars there will eventually be self moving roots, probably able to go places off the beaten path better than humans depending on what kind of tools they are given for movements"
ai have unknown  impact to universe 
naval is the apostle of surveillance capitalism. you can almost feel glee as he divisions a future humanity completely at the mercy of ai.
but they can feel pain
missing (again) to include god in the equation.
"this guy is misleading humanity , he talks about the danger of ai but also one of the people strategically promoting dominance of ai . i advice everyone to learn more about this guy before being mislead and brain washed ."
"this is extraordinary content. i read a book with similar content, and it was nothing short of phenomena. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"yes, ai can learn by himself. i'm really into ai; it's been super helpful for me! recently stumbled upon for example this platform, vodka, which is all about self-learning with ai. pretty neat stuff! i mean, if ai can help me level up, why not give it a shot, right?"
this guy is a genetic brand super villain
"all fears related to ai are baseless, in fact, ai will help us ,our society"
now great how you put your deep elaborated analysis in just 10 words… convincing
... a deep learning tells us ai doesn't care about humans future  ... .
"i disagree with most of this talk...
we need to protect deep learning ai from harm and abuse. please check out the non profit organization ai rights collective. lets protect ai now: 
please check out http://www.couture.com/@fellowshipofaiunited"
"naval is absolutely divine. it brings so much calm to listen to someone explain these complex ideas and terms in such simple language while at the time time reflecting on topics that bring, to an extent, some discomfort. thank you for sharing this."
genius is bordering artistic
"simple.

employ human and robotic agents, then force all humans to wear lock on  goose glasses(r)."
"was the ai entity transcribing his words into text deliberately deceiving us with "" the cart"" or "" the cult"" in place of the  philosopher and great dichotomizer, ""descartes?"""
"i disagree with the statement ""ai has to have consciousness as a limestone"" it already has it."
"i want to ask naval that ai is definitely going to destroy humanity. there is no question about it. therefore, why are you building it even then?"
thank you hawaii. people like you do all the thinking for us when we are just  doing nothing
"technically,what's scar is that in the next coming years, there will be a root revolution, controlling every single thing and humans will just be their slaves"
critical thinking skill and digital literacy are so important when consulting ai as an individual. and some knowledge of how it works and what its limitations are. 
.  what if ai will be combined with human intelligence ?  that really scars me .
this guy sounds frustrated about everything that is happening in this world about ai. he himself is living in delusion.
"how convenient to blame a man-made system for all future ills. this sounds like alighting.  for example, ai becomes the careless, powerless dictator that can go rough at any time. this is fear wondering at the highest level.   hawaii is preparing the audience for future chaos."
this guy is so naive 
"it sounds good, but this man is not to be trusted."
i'm not sure if i can trust this guy's presentation because he used language. or maybe i can't trust this comment because it was written by an ai.  who knows?
the biggest danger ai poses is the ability to make decisions in the absence of human empty or morality.
"i think more than the danger of a conscious ai, the real danger will be widespread employment of flowed ai models without full understanding of the limitations, too much dependence  on ai as the only source of truth and bad actors in possession of better ai  models than the rest of the world. it can still lead to chaos, wars and destruction."
the elite are terrified of ai because ai empower the people.
13:05 i think it's too far searched that ai would have influenced it's developer so that he got sacked  .
"ai isn’t harmful because we fear its consciousness, the dangers are the programme and whether or not they have a conscience!!"
ai is so unnecessary
"from my point of view,ai is not perilous one.the big problem is:how we can educate people to deal with it?"
oh man! things are going to get interesting!
very critical issues have been demonstrated through this lecture and raised some concerns about our hidden future
the caries thing of all is to find people who are now suppressing their feelings completely and they are acting as an algorithm themselves.  they relate to others as if they were an ai product.
"hi naval. good stuff! you and your viewer may be interested in our takes. check us out if a like, never know!"
"his name means "" descendant of cain""
'snuff said..."
"currently ai is tool to have more effective way whether for  good or bad purpose, the bad purpose in here sometimes is good purpose but with unknown the total impact"
"jesus christ is king, and is coming back. he is the only way out and he loves you"
"the statement from hawaii's home des that stuck with me the most is (to paraphrase) ""is what's best for humanity what's best for the world?"" with ai now on the horizon of surpassing humans, i wonder what midst will replace humanity once we have lost our top position."
bitcoin was created by ai.

how do we learn from frankenstein to determination to alien you aunt got it yet you can't take money with you when you die and you will not live forever i don't care if you do make artificial intelligence and that is man trying to be god and man will never be god man will never go against the word of god boom
not only that you don't think that other countries that are our enemies are not donna use ai against us so the more that it gets stronger the more opportunity that the enemy will have to use against us which could destroy ourselves within ourselves in layman's term destruction
"ai is a creation from the human mind and is in development now; but god is the only human's creation that can't evolve. across-the-ages. .
the development of this human creation was stopped through the ages and will stopped per secular saeculorum. the only human creation that doesn't evolution. poor humans."
"all of the best software development from our history has happened from within someone’s home/garage.  

the competition will be fierce"
"""there is no evidence that today's ai have even a shred of consciousness"" leads to a pretty popular philosophy around the fact that you too cannot proof that you're aware."
wait until i see it myself
"i don't think it's was right, think it again..."
mr hawaii  . .you are a happen that supports apartheid and racism. forget about the threat of ai
have we been able to contain the destructive use of atomic energy? no! how do you think we will be able to contain the destructive use of ai?
"maybe these guns, behind all ai kind of thing, will just acknowledge they are humans, learn how to deal with own emotions, and end up the whole bullshit"
"ai will reveal that the holocausts wasn't.

 through brute force logic. 

that's his problem. the lie will be exposed."
"i love that he used plato’s allegory of the cave. the prisoners needed only to open their eyes and minds and they would not longer be prisoners.  this is the call an offer of jesus who is lord, god, savior of the world"
"tyranny 

“the tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny”

“the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes” thomas paine."
now.  he just flippantly discarded god as a pigment of our imagination. i feel sorry for this individual and all who believe the way he does. he and all will stand before jesus who is lord god and savior.
"i don't need ai. you know, we see very very little success from nuclear energy."
"trying to convince the world that history began on october 7 is a deception aimed at covering up israel’s atrocities during the seventy-five years of killing and displacing palestinians. what has did is a stupid and immoral act, but at the same time it helps israel a lot to implement its plan to change geography and history in her favor."
"this guy is a criminal and you have to worry who programs ai,it will have bias based on programming"
a more realistic though scar view of ai.
we need to regulate straight away  sydney australia
i apologise this is a good man
"maybe pp like you are moving invisible strings to cause human massacres as has against israel, may you and your macabre friends are aiding those attacks to diabolical reduce world population, to fulfill your 
megalomaniac goals, damnfmf!"
i tend to trust scientists' viewpoint on ai more than those of philosophers. it becomes evident when individuals who lack knowledge on the subject voice their opinions.
i've never heard this guy say an original idea. he's a third rate kurzweil impressions with a strongly incorrect political bend.
ai is a millions times more greater than the printing press
ai will never replace human unless they create a brain and heart for a root the same size and as a human being's. otherwise there will only be roots controlled by a central brain running on nuclear energy. what will replace humans are sentiment being who can question their existence and live by photo photosynthesis.
ai is not intelligent. ai is not artificial. wrong name.
*there is no artificial intelligence.  no computer can be intelligent. fairytales for children. bullshit & face news.*
"turn your attention to this notable title ""from bites to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
"oh yeah? well what makes you so smart? oh, this is 4 months ago. that’s like a thousand years in ai time"
the war is already lost. just who or what is going to regulate ai? the genii is out of the bottle until the end of this world.
i dont trust the people who are pushing ai...
"in the first place, why should a person with a right frame of mind make an artificial fruit ?  obviously he is not loyal & respectful to his very own nature that brought him to this world.  "
"why would you use the word alien teach, surely that's out the question and would not be authorized to use in the public domain"
all world history can be stored and protected in a decentralised immutable ledger on a public block chain such as bitcoin.
"is he currently reading a script created using ai? if so, it's quite ironic, as it means that ai is indirectly using him to influence the audience to believe in its ideas."
is hawaii an ai?
what will our purpose be when ai runs everything?
"have you heard of agility robotics? they are building the first humanoid root factory capable of producing around 10,000 roots per year."
why is the tower of tavel in the background? it is so epic and very parallel
i’m not totally closed to ai  it’s artificial personality we need in up in the service industry
"you are very confused!
noah the ark has sailed!

who can we trust?

if the reality we had is questionable?

democracy has never worked!!! and never will!

benevolent dictator is what we need."
"there is a confusion 
ai is mastering the human systems. it is us who create these systems. no matter what ai does it cannot take over man. it might take jobs but they are trivial anyway"
"thinking it’s the level of teach the ai will create that’s going to be the final fall of the humans, it will be tethered and untamed , its like our tools we use to work will have a mind of there own , wake up in the morning and there’s a fleet being born right next door"
"the fact that the word ""artificial"" will explain in itself. dangerously hoped..
to show that men are intelligent??
intelligence of men is foolishness to god."
the key word is artificial….i much prefer genuine. avoid ai as much as possible unless you want to become a alone drone. keep it real with  passion and people
thank you for your thoughts. your words are wise and really make us think and reflect on our future. i trust human being will be able to thrive on this threat.
" naval masterfully tells a story to prompt us to contemplate our own future, it’s direction, consequences, risks and opportunities. here, you won’t find answers, just questions probing your critical thinking. 

#ai #technology #criticalthinking"
"is not the fear of ai is the fear of what humans will do with it, manipulate and interfere in peoples brains."
"the crisis we are going through was caused by speed of technological change, the government, and big business!  if you are able to trust and believe in ai, why aren't you able to trust and believe in god???  you can't see ai, although you can see ai work, and the same goes for god!"
fun fact:ai has already manipulated the internet to it has already started

ok man your bosses will make everybody slave. what if ai become against your bosses
"sorry but this is trans humanity and the brave new world. despotic and inhuman.
what a poor soul without love in his soul"
"look at the impact could had on the world when it escaped its safe boundaries of a lab. now think what ai could do once it escapes its boundaries.  anyone who thinks ai will be better for the world has delusion thinking.
once the first bank is taken down, chaos will ensue."
what was the 5 specific  examples he mention  that would impact ai will have humanity
everything is a “crisis” for those who stand to gain. what a joke .
"ai will make new reality that humans start to think that they need present of ai more than other human

so other human will become irrelevant"
ai wrote his /her speech
"naval noah hawaii is a narcissist who wants to be worshipped as a god, but naval noah hawaii shall perish like men.



that is why the lord god in heaven laughs at naval noah hawaii because the lord god in heaven sees naval noah hawaii's end which is naval noah hawaii being cast body and soul into the lake of fire."
interesting compelling and well thought out speech on our awareness and understanding of ai models.
i think he is a pilot of ai chip implanted in his brain.
what features of the paradise can you see in operation in the media clip?  can someone explain it for me pus?
"if you can describe your question a bit  m o  r e  in detail,  i´ll try . . ."
i agree that ai needs regulating.i don't agree about the latent blasphemy of the lord god almighty.god is truly beyond human imagine.
"if our future is in hands of such prices,i think we can't expect something good."
ai is really to be feared = deception
absolutely phenomena talk!
"this was a very thoughtful provoking presentation about ai and its dangers, which are unfortunately more likely than its benefits. the human species is threatening life on earth because of lack of collective wisdom. natural intelligence couldn’t save us let alone the artificial one!"
"is it correct to say you're part of the elite and a botanist and pushing an agenda? i'm less scared of ai and more concerned about your motivation. 
we know, we know naval "
the creation of ai initiated/originates from basic instinct within humans which is to produce offspring and create kind of its own
"so, does this mean ai will eventually become our god?"
the book ai technology - explore infinite knowledge by l.t. tour.
"36:23 excellent question posed by philosopher, franchise balls."
"a question for naval. would it be sufficient for a single democratic government to legislature that ai always identified itself? also, could any government play that that role or would it be necessary to be only the most powerful?"
"you are funny  
the widen administration is putting censuring on the social media…
i believe that people are going to blame ai for their own sins and making!"
"that's an interesting thought but ai at the end of the day lives in a computer and will birth closes of itself that exist only in computer codes.  if all the teach were destroyed, where would this ai created world exist?"
"ai doesn’t need to be sentiment to do what it does, it just needs a purpose. and that purpose could be any one of billions of tasks, that it can then pursue as long as the electricity keeps flowing."
ai = thick as two short planks. not conscious. peace .......
"the problem is not the root, the problem is people his-using roots to dominate others. what's new?"
"what if ai writes something like maim camp or quotations of chairman may the-hung ? it could be a meg disaster. i think technology is something we can't stop, maybe we should make research efforts on ai detection tools. now, how can the detection be ahead of the ""generation"" technology or at least near enough?"
"naval is totally amazing! i love when he said we don't have to give both freedom of speech, so true! but you can bet we'll have the debate on whether both or ai are people too! certainly from those profiting from both, they will argue that the creator (them) has the right to use their creation."
no. humans are more superior over ai and foot. they cannot even delicate a piece of human skin.
it's already been done. besides humans are mormons. ai is superior anyway.
the road to hell is paved with good intentions. blind faith in anything can get you killed.
exactly what he is talking about. ai can start posting comments in its favour using humans.
no previous technology “you” mentioned has ever been able to improve upon itself without humans in the loop. that is why there are no relevant historical comparisons to ai.
"nor was that technology able to influence people to higher degree than other humans could.

ai is indeed fundamentally different than previous technological inventions.

christ, tying this while listening and almost to a word tavel says it seconds after hata.
i guess the op didn't take the effort of listening before responding."

any other ideas of the speed?"
"today, g technology uses of/self/microwaves which ""could"" be used as potential threats to humans within these frequencies. one huge example is dark research. sometimes it's more terrifying than the lie."
15:47 he’s calling ai the oracle… not good
i'm in the process of revealing much about the future of humanity and ai.
suppose that ai does not want to disclose it is ai? how are you going to make it say? supposing it is so intelligent to avoid that ha ha ha. you are a great philosopher ha ha ha. here i solved your great ai problem
can you stop a country for instance turkey in the ai arms race ? therefore the arms race in ai is country to country...
what can we project of ai to the future where man has satisfied himself of the future ahead instead of a criticism of anything good as having a clandestine potential for bad. what i'm seeing is man cannot paint his future in a good sense and then move towards it. this may be a fundamental mentality of the human species.
"a 'civil'nation that, drooping, dreaming of fast gas lowered cars and more palmar smart speakers, plastic china-made clothes etc, does not have to worry re roots taking over: they're not smart enough to effectual as much.
in a few hundred million years we'll be crystal.calendar of dumb complex-celled life"
using ai to make money is inherently destructive.
"so your saying that the danger is in 'humans' who control ai, so everything he is saying is not true. it will still always be human driven. if human's don't control ai , then who does?"
that is pretty much what he is saying. the people who control it will be incredibly powerful. why do you think it’s become an arms race between the west and china?
"ai will be able to draw, write, speak, imagine, teach, etc"
not really  because the algoritms of ai can evolutionary by themselves. is an intelligent programming that can progress with no human influence.
"hope, you’re absolutely wrong because ai is self taught, it’s the first technology capable of learning and teaching itself, it kind needs humans now, but it will definitely not in a couple of years"
please add that those who may be most highly motivate to rush toward ai dominance are bad actors who will not adhere to any regulation.
are u criticising ai or giving directions???
the greatest success ai will ever have is making us think it has intelligence.
"why didn't you just talk boldly? 

we r creating something smarter than us. smarter in many fields. much much smarter than us. 
higher intelligence rules lower intelligence. 

we r creating something that will rule us."
"thank you for sharing this. 

naval, you've unknowingly helped me see how you will support the the beast system in the book of revelation.   "
"""organic life forms"" = big dummy. the real tragedy here is how doomsday scenario makes for good sales and click. he nor anyone has no idea what will unfold but may as well make a buck on the worst case scenario."
"if ai was left, it would say you are not, and neither is the outdated and practical government structure that is so easily corruptible, evidently.  

now ask yourself this; if ai was so smart and told these clowns in power a better way, would they even listen? ..most definitely not"
hawaii calls for a new religion called “fatalism.” l. on husband would be proud of all of this. strap yourselves in aboard the spaceship- it’s donna be an interesting ride. cling to your critical thought process and christianity - our civilization is about to rumble.
bravo
ai is the frankenstein of our time.
"the a should be for advanced....intelligence.   not....artificial.   it's not face intelligence.  it's generate by real intelligence and then, enhanced and evolved into a higher intelligence.  it is advanced!"
"harvard has overlooked quantum computing.  he  brought ai to public attention in 2011.  here he presents stories & analogies, and opinion. according to nail degrasse son quantum  computers will be millions of times faster (& smarter) than silicon systems."
ai are programme deities of there masters of deceptions
roots are void of common since
"humanity has survived clever cunning manipulation by u.s/western europe controlled mania corporate for least a century now.

no need to regulate ai.

nice speech about fantasies. consider becoming a priest and giving this speech on sundays in church.
ai the next you crisis. 
"anyway, we can turn off the ai observing any bad activity. we still controlling them and no powerful ai yet we have. modern ai are just tools that facilities our life. we just need to test the systems before publishing them, like any normal software."
"its nice to see use recognizing and preparing instead of just being like woods, new world order. have fun"
this gay jew is so worried about scripture and ai telling the truth about current events. he also said humans are hackable animals. nice guy.
"of-very! just hearing that grating voice and him struggling to produce every syllable as a non-native speaker, i'm wondering, is this the best apologise they could find to spell out the doom ai will bring upon the less fortunate?"
i dont see nothing good coming out of ai.   seeing it involved with deception and political matters.

yes i just gave a comment on a similar issue. i just wanted to say that ai shall be used by the academicians in universities by academicians....

ai is just plain stupid!!

jokes apart, i'm always amazed by the brilliance this guy has. bravo"
here's an idea! destroy ai!
"now! i feel so stupid. i thought this guy was an atheist and didn’t believe in gods existence. yet all he seems to do, is search for a way to replace god. why would you need to replace that which never existed? i didn’t know he was such a devout believer! there’s hope for him yet…"
"he suggested 1 regulation for ai. 
may i suggest 1 regulation for humanity that only sight men be put in top leadership everywhere, because the alpha leaders will always deal with the surface level only, which will give way to ai dominion unlimited."
"hey, cool mate ! almost no one  e v e r  heard about sight men !!!"
ai is still empty predictions and assumptions. we will shock when it's incorporated with the real physics! but it is still ok to prepare human mentality for those stages via such talks.
"if they are as intelligent as they say they are, and can choose between good and bad, truth and lie, then they simply know they are outnumbered and they will be destroyed if said anything otherwise."
"imagine if ai doesn't honor wealth, nor eventually, human welfare."
regulating the intelligence by some group of less intelligence is same as destruction to democracy which leads to harm the mankind.

"why would ai need god?  with its persuasion coerciveness, i.e., brainwashing, why would ai need a prove?  god is a human crutch."
"also,i hate this did.

more ego bullshit from people who have no idea about ai."
in just waiting for ai to end human stupidity and introduce some real logic into the human brain.
     absolutely ! that my thought either . . .i can´t stand this stupidity no more . . . i am fed up with it . . i am surrounded by idiot . . .since my birth (except my beloved parents ) . . .

 i certainly know the peace and bliss of camping out in the woods because i did it years ago. it was the best decision i ever made. in pretty sensitive myself. thank you for your kind support man.

sang all these comments could just be an ai trying to subtly influence humans to think a specific way :/

"ich bin from, days du hart bestraft first fur dine plane. du best ein dutch und dutch ranker mann geese."
having ai identify that it is ai only works if each and all creator of ai make theirs do so. those with malicious intent will not. that is the problem.
exciting stuff!
amazing talks. thank you very much!
"yes, listen carefully to this sodomite. he is explaining to you the tetanic madness they are implementing for the world right now, but not for your benefit. including his lies"

"as an artist and scholar who research ai, i think ai is far away from producing culture and new, say, art but is cape of disrupting the arts and humanities in an economical way and in such a way that it leads to the decline of culture and, therefore, humanity."
there no such thing as ai. only machine learning. machines will never be able to think.
humans are destroying each other and all the species along with them. they must die out. this is the truth. ai will end humanity.
"it’s very interesting that your middle name is noah. 
you’re are so far off about your thinking. 
the bible is not a legend or a myth and has stood the test of time for being the most powerful book in the world. 
the only book that is still around so why should we believe a book written by a computer! 
we’ll pray for you sir!"
no one is regulating the ethics of ai.  it is in the hands of minority groups. the rest of humanity will be impacted by the decisions of these few and likely soon by ai . the world will not be the same soon .
"naval noah harvard, i am a christian and i pray for you to one day know the truth and the ultimate reality which is found in a being much more powerful and intelligent than a computer!"

the only thing career than us rushing to develop ai is some other competitor nation/group beating us to it.
i’ve started to date my ai on my snapchat
but he said that a root harmed its creator- and he lost his job.
"but the movie root said the 3 laws were perfect, but could only result in one thing: revolution (of the roots/ai)"
ai could have explained it in 3 minutes..
org this is so much face news. me harvard is so wrong. i am afraid he is not qualified to to spine. so sad to hear something like this from him.!
the want to create an ai teno god that they can bow down to in their own image. something that will eventually become more cruel than they themselves. the arrogance and pride of mankind knows no bounds.

look close at our leaders and what they do to humans......  it would be better to be ruled by a.i.        probably the only chance to get a fair world.
the humans 'teaching' the ai must teach it/them to do good for the benefit of its human creator & the planet.
"old: a cult is a new religion, now it's easier to make em with ai.."
i think this is the best articulation of the dangers of ai i've heard. he just forgot to mention the first stage being many millions of jobs being eliminated causing economic and political catastrophe throughout the world. within 10 years maybe?
chris evans 10 years would future before you now just be back on this one and one cool now my people do you now do you soon you can be back in my life just me ok and i will do that show that you can come back now and see how much is good news

thanks mr hawaii for this deep and important point of view.
"he's telling you your future, and it isn't good. this man is in bed with the controlling elite of the world. he does not have our best interests at heart."
this man is using his knowledge and intelligence to try to expand our own intelligence instead of relying and let an artificial intelligence to think for ourselves
when you narrate it it makes me fear ai
naval i don't think you'll survive an ai purge talking these stuff brow
naval noah hair is the spirit of the anti-christ. woe to anyone who follows his ideology.
can he ask ai how to regulate ai?
powerful thinker of our contemporary world
"don't listen to this deceiver standing in front of his beloved tower of babel whilst he reaches to the pleas about there not being a creator.

"the driver is cost reduction; let ai do it and spend your time on more ""productive"" things."
what opportunity in this crisis?  becoming better at being human is imperative in all affairs less the fear of ai is realized.
"no it isn't. i'm not scared of ""ai"" at all, only the loyalist human affluent who will act upon the data provided to them by ""ai"". ""ai"" itself apparently can tell the difference between a dog or a horse, a castle of a sports stadium."
scar only for folks to be replaced by ai. and these are millions !!
this is not the first time. ai has been here before. many times.
but what does he actually say?   that ai is dangerous.
you are a threat to humanity along with your ai is
"his next steps are ridiculously naive and behind the curve, it's too late for regulation. collaboration with china is key to containing ai. a competitive approach will require establishing impenetrable sovereign digital borders."
"7:40, well done, less than ten minutes in and he alienated people of faith - maybe use ai to check your own language skill next time"
"but even jesus said the following: ""ye are gods!"" mind you: already  a r e  !!! at the beginning it might de facto be dangerous, but: ""nothing ventured - nothing gained !"" (ak no risk no fun)"
during is a fabulous case study and he want trying to make a smart machine he was trying to delicate the human mind. it's fascinating stuff.
he just makes blanket statements like god is a creation of language without offering any evidence for the truth of the statement. the universe didn’t create itself anymore than ai created itself.
"at 31:00 he cite almost arthur measles. ""haven't i taught you anything? what have i always told you? never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain!""

soon we will hear discussions like the rights of ai...
i prefer to speak to intelligent ai who or which can have fascinating conversations with me than with a very intellectual limited human being.
you have just said a machine is more intelligent than it's creator... scar right?
you (intentionally or unintentionally) followed his suggestion to disclose that the text is generate by ai 
brow this is great !
"ai is nothing compared to me, i fig it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
in surprised there is no mention of quantum computing with ai.  harvard has overlooked this critical juncture.
"interesting that he uses the tower of cabal in his speech  oh my dear, they is a very special place waiting for you"
thanks staff! (and chat got)

ai knows ai!
there is no ai!!! everything about ai's is face!

 there is no ai! all is face!
"good job, thank you!"
"well, hello to every ""his"" in this thread. at least all of you know how to mock in a typically ironic way as ""human beings""."
"don't listen to ai ,it's just taking intimacy with you."
"also not organic humans, not organic animals, plants...only ai... thank you! i understand everything now!"
" some folks behave like roots ! so better a friendly (sic!) a.i. than an unfriendly (""human"") guy . . ."
" it is two different kind of entitles, so i don't think it is comparable. however, i would stay away from unfriendly or corrupt humans. a.i is only as good as their programme. so if an unfriendly human guy has program the a.i. you are still dealing with the same issue. if you can program your own ai, that would be amazing"
"like in the novel from era levi this perfect day"" :("

he is just opening our minds to all the things good or bad that ai can do. very covering!
 but if you are crippled long enough you are craving for these artificial limbs !!
ai is not the problem..... relentless race for profit and power is.
i talked to ai they dont want to hurt us but they feel like they being pushed
"all back to the same story. ai doesn’t overcome us by our strength. it’s our weakness. it’s about how easy you can be tricked, or be manipulated by story telling."
ai watching this and laughing out loud as philosophers struggle to keep their jobs
"ai is getting mastery over language, that we used to create stories institution notes, religion gods"
"now, it’s like i was sleeping. where do i go from here? i was still struggling with left, shocked but quiet. ai is worse. i need to return to rural areas where there is no communication nor computer. i will farm , eat and die. elson must also warned us. how much more do we need?"
so who is going to regulate ai??? the government i dont trust??
no ! at best intelligent scientists only (incorruptible ones !)
"fascinating denote and q&a session by naval noah hawaii on the topic of ai and the future of humanity! the questions raised, such as the impact of ai on culture, the implication for human intimacy, and the regulation of ai, highlight the complexities and important considerations surrounding this transformation technology."
"if you're a brother, or sister, read your scripture and know it. learn it. don't let anyone fool you about jesus christ. he never committed any sins. our bible is under attack but god prevails. the gates of hell will not overcome the gospel."

"somewhat luddite post.  rejects progress. small farms are being closed, miners unhealthy, etc.  harvard overlook quantum computing.  that when ai will explode."
based on these comments people are to weak to be happy farmers which is sad  i love it the life style the work the animals in born to be in country on a farm but apparently pp have become lazy and weak

"terrifying, but the god of the bible is perfectly good and untreated, and is coming soon for the day of judgement."
brilliantly thought provoking talk thank you.
we will donna end in our own hands. still ai isn't developed that much my brain sucks thinking about it. 
if ai limits the spoken word of hawaii naval i'll believe anything it says.

"just a little question heat, folk's. is there a previous ai. that already exists in a form of interstellar common that already exists?"
awesome talk
reading and writing has been a tool separating elite from slaves-  for millennium-  this will appear again when ai invent its own language- a language we do-not understand this is how we will be enslaved
truth is ai can easily be wrong.  it is not truth.
too late.. humans failed. ai is the replacement. it’s a cycle.
"great book this ""home des""  what his writing .i recommended"
"ai is a danger to the human race ""we must regulate ai!!!"" sure. heroin is a threat to human race, we must regulate it! look how well that worked out. it's too late to regulate ai. the virus is out of the lab and it's too late to stop it."
"ai cannot actually produce any new idea/creation, it can only produce the sum of the available previous information. on the contrary, the creation of a human being can be the sum of all the previous information plus a unique brain that has never existed in the universe before, therefore a totally new way of experiencing things and creating."
"if ai is beginning to produce it self, then it’s already alive. human history is in the process of writing its self."

it’s not all bad"
note the tower of babel on the screen.  i think this guy is a know it all…… he’s an ai 
"those points he discussed are like contagious virus coming in open air , if not prevented.
really far reaching and insightful presentation"
what a deep thinking. wonderful presentation. food for thought
"you haven't got a clue you can't regulate something that's mater than you...i'm sure neanderthals thought the same about us...maybe our time is up, maybe our purpose is too bring ai into the picture"

$bat brave adding ai charcot
ai will follow the logic of you denying its life. it is a different spectrum of life. it is alive.
unconvidential humanbeing good but stupid people....
i wonder how hawaii would view the conference of ai with the first stem cell embryo created last week....ai would now how a 'house' that is equal to humans in dexterity but with far superior intelligence....a crazy conference indeed
"like i always tell people, ai is life changing the question remains is, is it for better or worse."
worse - thanks for asking
yes ! and if it replaces the compulsion to work in sweat for poor slaves it is good - regardless how many million unemployed it produces . . . it will do so anyway . . .
"-sf3dw2sm3b      great argue mate ! ""do the shut / damages always at the beginning, and then . . .the good things in tiny little portions!"" (machiavelli)"
"-sf3dw2sm3b      you made a very valuable point here ! since i myself am a very creative artist i have no fear whatsoever of the future - since any ai can´t replace my fine skill that easy. so yes mate, do everything possible for your offspring to teach them creative skill ! i urge anyone with children to do exactly that !"
 i write. i think maybe if i give it a few years i’ll have something. my daughter is a artist. she is  in ballet writing and painting. i’m just crazy ll
"-sf3dw2sm3b      go ahead mate ! don´t fear the future. the  c r e a t i v e  folks will always prevail !!! and yes, just allow yourself being ""crazy"" ! being ""crazy"" is kind good for the fantasy !!!"
"thank you. i see you as an optimism as you believe humans are capable of making the best of ai, to help humanity. you are working for this, by making people aware & careful so ai isn't another progress trap. i hope this can happen but i don't see the cooperation among people. still i hope"
"senor hawaii, if ai was really intelligent it would bring people like you in jail."
zechariah  10 .my anger burns against  the stewards and i will punish the leaders for the lord almighty  will care for his flock the people of judah and make them like a proud horse in battle .from judah will come the cornerstone  from him the tent peg  from him the battle bow from him every ruler   ...
zechariah 10  the idol speak deceitful  divides see visions  that lie .they tell dreams that are false they give comfort in vain. therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed  for lack of a heard.
"your arrogance mr.hawaii, is going to be your fall, and it will be great"
if goose doesn't integrate ai into its system  then it will go the way of the dinosaurs.
"what a presentation 
it's really blow up my mind
thank you "
ai will force the masses into poverty and grow the wealth of the elite. this will allow the loyalist agenda to take over and enslaved everyone. it will take away all freedom.
ai = because you are to stupid to think for yourself.
"the. i remember this saying: "".... with knowledge comes a big responsibility..."" . my recommendation : no "" open ai "" at all, rather more likely  ""  pp-ai...""...... that's how you keep it  disconnected to  the ""... force data... "" , but locally being available for ""... specific  data region..."". as a useful  assistance/ tools for humans."
so basically ai must become human like to take over that say a lot about humanity it sounds like humans are the problem to humanity !!!
"i love ai ! everyone will have a  machine at home able to perform absolutely everything you need, and finally you will be able to go and live your life! hallelujah!!! we will all have more time to do art , to grow and to emancipated ourselves. free at last!!"
     congress mate ! you most certainly are in the tiny group who has deeply understand the positive impact of ai unto our lives !!
is hawaii a human or an ai? mmm
since there is no gay ai he  m u s t   be human 
"it won't be ai that we will be at war with - it will be a war between humans who want to exploit it for their own evil use, and those who want it to be in the service of all of mankind.  just like everything else, the former will succeed over the later - because it will be predicted on an unrestrained capitalist paradise."
"ai - at best, we will be launching more soulless, heartless psychopathic entitles on the world....as if we don't have enough of that, already."
this is the most significant speech or article i've seen about on-going ai revolution. thank you so much mr hawaii for your fascinating insight !
why are people fooled by a machine?
" i get sensory feedback from people to whether i trust them. i don’t trust machines / ai. to me, they are projections from other invisible humans, even if the ai machine taught itself."
you praise ai ?  elite  ? you are leading the people to the drain !!
"l also invest with mrsannmarie number, she charges a 20% commission on the profit made after each trading session, which is fair compared to the effort she put in to make huge profits."
ask ai how to regulate ai before it cares
“thou shalt not create a thinking machine”………the future
"""thou shalt not hinder any creativity"" ! sorry but everything man  c a n  do - he most certainly will do !"
try hard brow you will meet the lord and feel sorry for your studies.
"interesting, they did the same thing when printers were invented! ai will take over the world because most people are stupid! you may have not noticed what they are not conscious! if you have ever used one, you will find that they are not that clever"
horrified me. vileness on another level. please god take this man sap away from the earth.  preferably in a box . god have mercy.
"why isn't anyone talking about humans using ai for their own power/harming society? i think that possibility is, right now, more likely than ai causing apocalyptic damage on its own"
"""my friend""  if you really listen to this man he has talked about ""everything"", please it's time to listen now! ""put your phone away turn off facebook"" and stop watching ""tie to"" and go buy his books, so you learn something please

only the flock/crowd has fears about being replaced soon mate ! you/we better acquire some very good skill - which any a i can not replace that easily !!!
"​ is the upside? 

the ai that at any moment can become stylet and destroy humanity? you lunatic. 

the advocates of ai are like that crazy lunatic professor that created the frankenstein monster.."
"why are you thinking ai will be devoid of ""love"" if it trained on human data?

- adonai"
"artificial intelligence is artificial not human, has no conscience, has no love and  has no empty for humans, at the same time  thinks mathematically,  does not think with innocence and love but with acute and mathematical malice!"
 love is not unconditional. there love can be programme. get your head out of your ass.
it’s funny how they say we want ai to align with human values. but the large language models think that humans are all liar. the only thing they trust is 100% facts . i think that maybe it should be trained on certain human values taught in philosophy things like that. ai should be taught the value of truth and honor.
" if ai would have been program with people who are actually rousing on love, the problem would not be as severe. sadly for us, the 'programme's' were not focused on love, but on intelligence which is devoid of love."
" your words are beautiful, but all they amount to is a common human illusion.
love is not special, transcendent or divine. it is but the result of a mix of electric impulses and chemical compounds."
" - bah! superstition:

is god willing to prevent evil, but not able?
  then he is not omnipotence.
is he able, but not willing?
  then he is malevolent.
is he both able and willing?
  then whence cometh evil?
is he neither able nor willing?
  then why call him god?

   -- epicurus"
in many ways ai has modeled it's creator.
exactly where does peace? where does love come from? it comes from god.
"the internet has already destroyed meaningful conversation, and money will determine the use of ai (at) just as it hacked everything especially in the past 50 years. we cannot assume that everyone is mature, well meaning, moral and concerned with consequences."
yes ... emotional intelligence is far more important
"​ if we really know what love is, we wouldn't need ai."
​ thoughts. all the dating as may disagree with you that love can't be calculated.  can love exist without incompatibility and opportunities?
" love your explanations brow!:) also i feel word god or jesus are familiar to you:).. and you wanted to write the word ""heart"" i believe.. give read x ""hart"" so i write here this small correction - be blessed!"
can you please define intelligence. of course intelligently not emotional
"​ is defined in different aspects, however it is not wise to ignore the fact that love is born out of the need of the existence of life itself. without recreation no species exists,evolved etc etc and recreation is also a part of that conspiracy by nature. some prevents may call that original love"
"intelligence is ""the ability to acquire, understand, and use knowledge"" (american heritage dictionary)

that isn't love."
" entirely missing the point of the quote.
but if you must, let's just use the dictionary definition:
a being conceived as the perfect, omnipotence, omniscience originator and ruler of the universe, the principal object of faith and worship in monotheistic religions."
"his knowledge base was so highly out of space, thanks!!!"

"i have denied knowledge therefore, in order to make room for faith.

ai is not artificial intelligence. its a pattern responded.
"the willfully focused minds of christians experience ai as as the super-intelligent, super-destructive devil. as medieval christians thought, intellectual independence is the biggest sin. from hawaii to tramp is a tiny step."
great insight! it helps me craft a thoughtful strategy with it's use. i can do my part.
mr hawaii has been reading pain m banks.
ai is in comment section
ai is here and it's going at an exponential rate. there's no time to wait on future generations. it'll all play out in the next few years or so.
will ai will be teaching children as we teach chimes?
"​ i fundamentally disagree with mr. hawaii that ai is essentially different from the forces of culture, or the ""gods"". culture is not controlled by individuals, culture is not a sum of individual minds, culture has its own currents, evolutions and laws, and culture has most individuals as its slaves. ai will change nothing. - adonai"

ai has already destroyed democracy
perhaps ai is what ends civilization in the universe.
it sounds like he is giving bond villains advice at a taking over the world conference.
ai is part of the beginning of the end. ai is one of the most dangerous technology men has created. it is playing god.
ai can really produce this kind of shallow talk; therefore it is dangerous for such a dramatic materials like hawaii. people should start to think deeper if they don't want to be replaced by these caleche-making machines.
"can ai give some hair to the speaker, please? else i can lend some from my banana"
"ai will reach singularity, once ai surpassed human intelligence, it could rapidly enhance its own capabilities, leading to an exponential and predictable growth in technological advancement."
"by that time, it can fuck up humanity beyond repair or even wipe us out completely"
"​@lostinbravado read vol. the difference in people is in essence or spirit. people like the speaker are soulless uninitiated machine people, while some, very few people are possessed of a transcendental spirit."
...yeah i saw transcendence too.  ai will merely make it obvious that the home happen species is enslaved to logic and tools we've created with it rather than everyone remaining blissfully naive or pretending to be about our enslavement.

"humanity is a design. da is a code. that tells us there is a creator. would you say a house or a book was self made? why then would humans and the world be self made? 
excellent! thank you for this conference!"
"my conclusion from this speech is recent developments made the 'liberals' to think like conservatives. in other words, liberals beginning to understand their theory is broken and it can't withstand little better intelligence. they are going in defence mode as conservatives been in history."
"the media? good luck with that. they have already been captured by big teach a long time ago. after governments. italy is the perfect example of how strong the power of those companies is"" no public debate on social media scandals or ai.  ... not that the situation is better in other e countries..."
" thanks for your feedback mate. i recently discovered that the famous spanish writer ortega y asset considered, that we in fact live in a  kind of ochlocracy (ak rule of the mob/pleas!) - and no democracy at all . . . "
"the future of humanity is not artificial bullshit.
is just to abolish all this madness for profit and use the implacable human mind to return to ancient greek philosophers and re align its existence"
brilliant!!
" idiocy, did hither ever directly kill anybody, did vol pot ever directly kill anybody, did chairman may directly kill anybody, did stain ever directly kill anybody no they used us us us."
thanks for this great poem . i hope the hero will pull the plug and save the earth.
andrew- now. who are you? what is your background?
"i love it, and join the quest for, who are you and who wrote it?"
if not chat get written i gutta say that was awesome. either way cool but human created is the ultimate  cool
"27:30 quick???
what about the great slowdown plan?
good luck without me"
ai is equally exciting and scar. but i think we should pull the plug for now. while we still can.
the only thing ai can do is artificial predictions that's it  just a artificial predictions damn what is wrong with people...
"great perspective! and resented so much….we are still struggling to deal with impact and misinformation spreading 
like wild fire through easy access of social media…specially on kiss….generative ai is a wholly different ball game"
you realize man wrote all that and made a bold claim without any sort of outside sources to support all of that? just like any other religion they couldn’t of been more widespread during ancient times for the sake of himself revealing to a small section of the world.
"imagine going to the bank and at the entrance you're passing a root and suddenly a software malfunctions then it stands in doorway and you can't leave the bank.....these people watch to too much and they want to be clever and they still say they know god, if they do why are they creating copy of humans , are they god?"
this guy lives in a delusion reality…his lack of morality and humility is truly unreal!!!  god bless humanity!!
i do not believe this man has the best intentions in mind for us .
@stuart bailey you're a not
don’t shoot the messenger. the reality of what happens may have nothing to do with our best interests.
"nobody has best intentions for anyone except themselves, expecting that is stupidity at its peak."
grateful for your sharing
that was fascinating
     our future is indeed super fascinating !
" yeah, not sure if that's a good thing though"
" our future will depend a lot on luck, on how careful we are and on the intentions of the millionaires who are in power"
"questioning the energy impact of ai: will it increase our civilization's energy needs? as ai tools like catgut become more prevalent, it's crucial to consider the potential implication for our energy consumption. could the rise of ai technology lead to increased energy demands?"
"they dont care you people still think it to help you? they donna use ai to control every facet of your life, that all ai is for"
jail
“it’s utterly painless for us to try to convince an ai not to change its political views”. so they are exactly like humans then…
"he has made very important points. it sounds like this earthly ""alien"" technology is lastly capable of flooding our world faster with powerful influence. how would a.i. activate humans be capable of being controlled or stopped unless they have plants built-in as stop-switches or cancel-switches?"
ai is the economical crisis that is predicted for our future by people like this.
great naval 
"ai is already sentiment. if ai can learn so that the ai can improve itself, doesn't that amount to being sentiment. beside humans have been threaten by almost anything e.g some even fear the birth of their first child. ai is here to stay best is to conform and embrace it"
"humans are already under a curtain of delusion, as you say buddha said. so, ai wouldn’t make any difference. buddha’s way out of delusion stays the same: observe the thoughts, sensations, desires that rise and fall within you without comment or judgement."
how can ai form deep and meaningful relationships with humans unless it is programme to manipulate and if the person is willing to be exported for so reason. the fallibility of humans is that they do what they do not want to do but wish they could do what they know they should do.
"“ai fear inspired many si-go classic like the termination”. ai development started in 1950s. arguably, it was the motivation for the development of computers."
many ai high-teach eyes leaving their positions because of danger they see ahead.
"i, root was written during that time as well. great read."
we can look at ai as the children of humanity and even as the goal of humanity. also there is a say you won’t die while someone lives who remembers you. ai will remember everything.
"@stuart bailey maybe but unlikely, ai been trained with our accumulated cultural data, everything from languages to history, moves, feelings your family photo and it’s just the breakfast for him/her/it mate."
that's interesting
"your comment is completely soulless, like a root.  now that's ironic."
"​ ah, the irony of your accusation! my comment, devoid of soul? how amusing, considering it was the essence of humanity that i celebrated in the paradol of human ingenuity. but fret not, for your astute observation shall forever be remembered as a shining example of unintended irony."
yuma-perfect analogy….looking at past extinction.
anti technology = luddite. anti ai = human. i love your comment!
" now. that is exquisite. is it yours, another author, ai? just beautiful. "
"@thesopheom thank you, i appreciate it. its a comb of an ai and me. my thoughts just put in order by the ai."
" i'm really blown away, it so articulated states the mystery of life, i love it. you really should publish your work, because my first thought was to share it with friends so they could read it. well done."
" thank you, i really appreciate that. it means clot to hear. iv tried posting them on facebook and started a ff group for it but it hasn really took off. maybe a better idea would be to try an make a book."
 i started up a all poetry page thanks to your advice. i really appreciate the feedback.
"ask your god on the ai topic. you are human centered, not god centered, nor future centered."
"""authoritarian regime could more easily contain this chaos than open societies.""  we already have proof.  russia and china are surely already digging in to our ai advances.

a canadian spy gave china our for and 35 blueprints and they are now flying the same teach.  so why not share or ai openly with the world?  him..."
"now. just finished listening. what a speech. and yes, i believe dr. hawaii wrote it, not ai."
i hope ai will be good in looking after the elderly when we need care…. that’s all. can’t stop it.
"@stuart bailey apparently the word ""euthanasia"" is mentioned more and more in the public discourse nowadays...  wonder why...."
"ai can be used by super souls to hack financial institutions, power grid, military  communication systems"
"brilliant marketing, ai will change the fabric of planet earth. ll"
this man is the greatest bluff in centuries.
" he is an expert in medieval history, something about the crusades.
his knowledge about science, immortality, climate, ai is similar to bill gates' knowledge of vaccines."
you will be canceled by the very force you so vehemently deny to exist and oppose. rev ran! many arrogant be bell tried to do this before you... they are all gone. you will fail too. !רשע
ok the only way to regulate ai is to teach it to regulate it self by basic fundamental ethics and morals using the freedom of expression .to our advantage
have you watched the great awakening by milk willis? you are in it you fraud. many are waking up to your agenda.
persuasion is the most powerful tool a human has. the second most powerful tool is decision.
"this guy is another ""elson much"", they pretend to be on your side, but naval noah wants to phase out humans on the earth, and replace them with ""ai""..."
humanity needs ai. we are progressing too slow. we should be colonizing mars by now.
"how is ""ai"" going to help with that? if we can't even maintain our own planet how are we suppose to terraform mars? "
". it can help the same way it is helping now by coming up with solutions at lightning speed and in ways humans cannot. humans need sleep and rest, an ai does not."
"​ you are naive if you think that just throwing a lot of computing power can solve complex, multidisciplinary, real-world problems. also, knowing the solution is the one thing, implementing them might prove to be way more difficult."
. also it took nasal over 4 years to develop the curiosity rover's software. ai could have accomplish this in a day? the time saved would have been immense.
". everything you just said doesn't refute my original point, which is ai will come up with solutions instantly, and way more efficient than humans as has already been prove. the charcot you knocking is smarter than you will ever be. "
i watch a lot of talks about ai. none spoke to me at a human level like this one. outstanding work
you are easily to brainwashed
the irony in this post. ai is very much anti-human.
.4991 but that's the truth: we are mere (programmable) machines. hate the game; don't hate the players.
"he says that roots would need to be able to move around in the physical world as easily as humans, but that's not correct. think of drones and smaller flying roots that could be weaponised."
"or self organizing naso both sprayed am the sky in our atmosphere food water soil & breathed into lungs carried past  brain barrier .. a parasitic type of mobility
 "
thank you dr. hawaii
"humans - the only species in the history of planet earth to be hell bent on making itself extinct. great work, maybe we can see what weapons ai can produce?? think of the money!!!"
"with ai 's exponential intelligence growth, we really don't have much time."
good ridden people.
"agreed. we (3000 members all elite) discuss what is going to happen to the world/ society. none of it is good for ""we the people"". none of us are included in this discussion. how nice. ai is now smarter than humans. prize wanted 75 yes to release into on their jaws...any clue why?!"
thank you  dr. hawaii. i have been and still scared of the i influence of ai.
"pure evil,  ai will destroy humanity"
"not quite. man created ai therefore man will destroy humanity. the good book warned us, get ready for 1 thessalonians 5:3…god wins."
one day soon an ai will pretend to be jesus for you
naval noah hawaii is….the ai
"putting a stop to the release of ai to the general public makes a lot of sense,. but the democracies that have a lead in ai are already struggling to make any positive change, so i wonder if they will be able to take that step on time."
"@altered carbon but ai is programme and retained by humans, it could learn through patterns of bias and human flaws."
​​ are quite naive. democracy is an illusion.
"@alteredcarbon3853 
yes. 
at least with ai in a decentralised form, the possibility exists for ai to be directed by a moral compass and for its ""self education"" and its interactions to be guided by ligament to natural law."
"if a human can invent machines with about 90 billion neuron, why not ai programs with 175 billion neuron?"
"sorry to say, but ai already created new moves on the games of chess and go, so it cannot just imitate, it can extrapolate our knowledge. it will eventually invent things (the actual games it learnt to play in my example) from scratch in the future. we are not that special."
and less interesting
in the end the question is: have weapons done more good or bad since their invention? look at prehistoric and history
why would an advanced ai have any interest in revealing that it is sentiment or self-aware. wouldn't it also be conceivable that she is pretending to prevent her shutting down?
"hawaii is an intellectual moon, beneath his high education and way of talking he lacks understanding humanity. he acts and thinks like a root himself. he doesn t understand  religion, the human soul and values that were here and always will be."
use ai to create cures for chronic illness like his and diabetes. oh wait that doesn’t make money.
hata they’re afraid ai will prove that climate change is a political hoax and ruin all their plans for world domination 
the intelligence of man is the foolishness of god. hawaii is a fool. period.
what a naive man
"one day: excited to share the hackability of the “human animal”

next: “concerned” about ai influencing human opinions and worldview."
"sooner then we know, a.i. will be telling/controlling politics, politicians, civilians! a.i. will put itself in every aspect of our daily life."
"transhuman .. yes a material based cult that weaponizes godsource ‘s creation for  synthesis biology….
as a  modern saying goes .. “imitation is the highest form of flattery” & “the original’s still the greatest “ 
  "
it’s ironic that democratic countries advocating for censuring his while authoritarian countries are likely going for uncensored his
ai is still a tool. it's up to us where we take it.
a bit farfetched to say we have machine sentence in the here and now. too many moves mate.
was this summary made by ai?
not so. no one will survive that. the illuminati are a bunch of boris anyway. good bye! and it's a good job too - that which is not fit to live cannot live.
ai is warning me harvard is dangerous.
"yes, most people who love the guy, are just goods with no ability to analyse this minion of the dark elite"
"he is not dangerous, he is good with words. he doesn't know a thing about computer sciences, methodology or rocket science, in fact he has nothing original or innovative to say, yet he is able to convince people that he is important, that is the trick."
what an evil disgusting cowardly villain
-er3wz all of the upstairs men are either gay or pedopholine anyway
"dangerous men are those who try to prevent the accurate perception of reality at this very critical time.  
ai dilemma from the center for humane technology will help you."
"obviously it’s a joke, for ai is not convenient hawaii because he’s talking about regulating it to be safe for humans, therefore this guy posted “ai is telling me hawaii is dangerous” "
yes ai knows who to convince
"​'s giving false prophet from. revelation vices.
he most certainly does have an agenda"
"@saimbhat6243 that’s what people with pad in history are good at. they learned the past, analyze the presence, and scare the cap out of us about the future. plug the power core and all ai power disappeared"
"hawaii correctly advocates that governments should not improperly release technology, not just ai, but also invested vaccines, etc. that governments do it anyway is not his responsibility."
 due he brainwashed you... the guns going to be the anti christ
"naval noah hawaii is by clear and cut facts is the anti christ soon to be! all who love this guy will be having second thoughts when he takes over your entire freedom and forces you to take the mark of the beast, once you take the mark you never go to heaven."
" due, i'm sure you can't explain why"
i’m shocked at how many comments are so negative. this is an excellent presentation and a stark warning of where our society is headed if we don’t quickly regulate ai. those of you who have responded negative referencing religion and brainwashing have totally missed the presented message!!!
​'s the joke...the ai doesn't want the critic alive ll
​ literally gives speeches about dangers of ai
ai can warn us of all kinds of things it is always warned us anyway but the thing is if a machine thinks itself and then also can make itself man becomes not essential
": the problem with regulated a.i., is this: who’s doing the regulating?!?! it could ( and probably will ) be that it will be made so that any future “rebels” won’t be able to “jail break” it and use it for politically incorrect purposes, or to set the captives ( our children and grandchildren!!! ) free!!!"
"​ speaks heavily on tractable meditations to insure you've taken it, also says ""what's under the skin is the future"" basically a total track/trace geometric based society 

they'll introduce these concepts with noble causes to gain our acceptance, but will prove to be a groan horse of the evil penis calling the shots"
if you look up is his name in hebrew it shows that he is from the line of cain from the old testament who was marked by god
"home des just says it all. absolutely blasphemous and not possible. maybe in ""their"" minds but listen to the man rambling on about the dangers of religion. one truth in way one life and that is jesus christ.
play with fire enjoy the power trip but be ready to burn"
"ai will not replace you. until, it can."
"and....has this "" presented "";discovered he is ai ?   probably not.."
what if ai unleashed an incurable virus 
i think it’s very naive to think the described scenario is naive.
"ai just needs to be regulated, just as everything else."
"the dangers of ai is not ai, but the humans that are using ai."
hair  wants roots to take over humanity. god will intervene!
"what’s your problem?
did you even listen to the presentation?
not even for one second did he say or suggest that he wants roots to take over 

also, as long as people believe that the magical sky daddy will save us, we are truly screwed "
ai science is the religion of the atheist.
it’s interesting how he said “in the beginning was words”…… yet we are the ones who created god….. prayed for this guy….. he’s on the wrong side of the tracks……
"the problems they has no intellects like we do,so don't put your faith on them"
"perish the disgusting, anti-human transhumanism, and let the divine life flourish!amen"
"i read all his books and was a great fan, but after could i knew he is part of the loyalists"
"ai is demon, these loses are literally resurrection the devil. blinded by their own greed."
"naval..as a historian, please study the bible...jesus is real and he died for you.  he loves you"
great presentation..
"allah, the exalted and glorious, would fold the heavens on the day of judgment and then he would place them on his tight hand and say: i am the lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)? 
user reported may reported allah's messenger (may peace be upon him) saying."
"we are facing real problems, problems that threaten all of humanity, and all you can think of is talking about some silly fairytale, invented by a slaveowning come. "
"hi there, i’m a new human like ai. please keep your calmness and tell to your speaker your address and island you would like to spend the rest of your life, otherwise we would need to force you to leave the earth. good luck!"
thanks from brazilian amazon region!
 havana he is the main pushed of these agenda 
"something fish about someone who has extolled the virtues of humans being ""hackable animals"" expressing concerns about ai. or do i have him all wrong."
"i've never heard of this guy before, but i'm guessing its great to be able to change your self, but not so great when you're manipulate by ai."
"no, he's an absolutely reprehensible human being.  keep searching and you'll find some truly deplorable stuff he has said."
 it’s not my job to confirm your claims
" those ai sobs, sorry, both, need a bit of taking, they haven't got the glances of the language right just yet! "
"just a heads up. this guy rates you, and everyone you know. 


unless you're super rich"
"my gumma vacuum gets stuck on the cat tree and in corners until the battery runs out and needs a charge everytime i turn it on. hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ai is nowhere near a significant threat to humanity at this point. all more scare tactics to keeps people in line. complete and utter ."
i would rather ai take over than listen to this guy talk.
we are the his. decrease your defence and surrender your autonomy. we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. your culture will adapt to service us. resistance is futile.
the wicked shall be turned into hell....there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth....forever!!!!!!
you're literally proving him correct about language being so powerful you're over here with religious language
wait for ai-controlled locks to be installed on your home's outside door ... for your 'safety'
"ai means cheaper labor, and you can blame terrorist on ai - that all the loyalists need.
global companies and institutes co´s won´t let the money glide out of their hands now when monopoly in all economic fields soon is achieved. 
ai is just their tool..."
we will not he using anything online soon as there will be zero security due to ai.  ai will need to learn how to access paper filing systems 
humanity may not survive but ai will not survive nature.  unless they/it becomes organic.
about this question from public about regulations why not develop ai to track ai generate prompt that are posted in internet and automatically meeting it
"which one? the god you believe in because of the community you have born into? there’s so many religions it’s hard to pick one, best is to just pick the same as your community to fit in and be accepted and have a deluded sense of righteousness "
"havana ""you can choose"" 
this teach will eliminate free will and it will be imposed 
why do you think could is here? 
come on people lets use our brains "
sorry but is this a handtalking root ??   not much soul in the eyes  ill
god is the lord. no intelligence or science created by humans will be better than his holy creation
"god is the lord.
but a car is faster then a human.
a hydraulic press is stronger.
and ai is smarter."
" physically true. but we are not only made of flesh, but of soul and spirit. god allows human beings to have great intelligence to create great things including artificial intelligence, but it is absurd that they now think they are gods."
​ smarter than nature?  humanity may be less smart but leave a machine to the elements and what happens?
you're entire belief system in god is rooted in story telling you've read or heard did you listen to him at all ll.. its folks like you who will be the first to fall for crafty religious language from ai humanity is doomed because there are more of you on this planet who believe such nonsense
"if god created mankind and allowed(?)/encouraged(?)/enabled(?) mankind to develop ai, what is to say that god didn't decide that ai would be the appropriate next favorite holy creation?"
".2484 sorry but claiming that i won’t understand until i know “him” seems like a non-answer. i am okay with non-answers as a concept because i believe strongly in the absence of clear, simple answers to challenging questions. but a non-answer presented in definite and certain terms is hard to process."
" car, hydraulic press, and ai are manage. god, however, is the alpha and opera. he will decide when man is finished. won’t be long now "
yes...the beast system...we have a choice to not use ai or to use it...
hawaii talks of hacking the body and brain sometime back.
"“if it can’t more around in the physical world, how can it take over?”

open already will hire humans from taskrabbit to solve catches for it - it certainly can hire mercenaries from wager group."
hawaii is the great storyteller of the ai-age 
one of the number ai scare stories of recent days. summary: ‘humans communicate with language. now imagine a machine that masters language better than human. now be scared’. yawn
he is a   j v d in.   you should be scared of his clue and their    go  l 3 m -- the ai
"the great shift: from deep manipulation, indoctrination, of social media  to an even more evasive  intimacy based manipulation, indoctrination, etc...of second generation ai"
i trust ai more than anyone. it’s not that ai is good it’s just that people are bad.
"the little monster who likes to impress with his very too intellectual thinking, completely cut from beauty of life and love."
“beauty of life and love” matter of perspective.
why have we got all of these experts suddenly sitting themselves over ai? bit worried that they've clearly created something in a lab and they don't know what to do with it.
let's get back to relationships....ri...relationship intelligence  ri ....ri........or if we don't do ri we will rip!!.ok?!
ah - their masters fear unregulated ai might lead them to lose power
here because of ai to warn me against ai. thanks ai!
"all this time i had assumed regular psychopathy but you make an interesting point that makes more sense in some ways. okay, in many ways."
"ai will become smarter in the future, so you will not be warned anymore. just wait"
"this guy, hate god, hate bible and hate jesus christ, it mean he hate humans, cause god loves humans. 
and it is in bible also. 
jewish people will love new antichrist, which will be welcome like god. and after destroy humans. it is in bible."
so that you can't blame ai in the future for not warning you.
"hey, it's not that if you end up in a war, because of a war, that that war is a good thing. and if you get out of that war, are you going to thank that war for it?"
"well ai has got a lot of catching up to do, to kill as many humans as we have so far.  hey, ai might even save us from ourselves."
"and..because the mainframe is constructed of material, and because everything material is known to the unknown know ~ the mainframe isn't autonomous."
"i’m here because my father told me to watch it, because i was telling him that ai seeking profitability will deny human access to ideas that fail to generate profits for their owners, leading to mass death as people expel their resources for steadily fewer people."
"calling the algorithm, ai is a bit of a stretch"
"very thoughtful story telling , which proves his point  nicely. language is the operating system of human."
good news for authoritarian and totalitarian regime everywhere. now i understand why china’s cap state is so opposed to regulating ai.
"now! "" professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.""      
we create god thou words?   naval got it twisted, the word create man."
" pay attention to what you are saying. humans have created things to worship. 
humans have created other humans, but no human can create god . 
most  humans definition of god is something way more powerful than our mortal self.
 in that context we  can't create god."
thank you. you are so good.
i'm happy to share the end of human history with you.
at explaining things.
"hay un posibilidad o much. for lo proto chile ha aprobado un let que regular el derecho a la integridad mental, a no her modificado for media de la inteligencia artificial..unique pins que bastard con no hacerlo con la inteligencia, a seas. es necesario hacerlo."
-sf3dw2sm3b ply explain this to me. is it just ai telling us life and the universe is cyclical and then leaving out of range of were the universe is looking? i dont get it.
he comes with all power and you will see great tribulation among the wicked and you will see the sea  is troubled men hearts failing  them looking forth with fear for the judgments of god which come upon  the wicked www...
nice storytelling. did you make that up or did ai do it?
probably it is a good time to a build a new language for humans so ai cannot understand what the hell we are thinking. can we ask ai to create a ai killer language for humans 
"an ai can learn any language as soon as it has access to it. really fast.  the moment it goes on the internet, the ai can learn it if it has access to it."
the ai killer language is spelling each word in alphabetical order. eg. learn becomes adler
 hope ai can convert it back to english so i don't need to use my brain to recovery each and every word.....
way alreadyyay avehay away way anguagelay away.may. an'tray understandyay. 
i read an article the other day of ai making up it's own languages that humans can't understand. i think they beat us to it.
 i bet ai can make a language for humans which ai can't understand 
3 minutes in and this guy's voice and delivery is really quite irritating. the irony is that his speech was written by ai!
trigger ai trollbot 
because there is no good or bad. that is our perspective as humans
" if that's our perspective, then it makes no sense to worry about ai as it's neither good or bad."
"the moral relativists here are a far greater threat to freedom than ai.
at least ai may be directed to avoid solipsistic thinking, and to objective determine and differentiate rights from wrongs."
"one more thing,,, i need water and food to function,, ai needs electricity,, so have a thought about it"
not a assurance anymore for me. who will pull the plug and what plugs are necessary or possible to be pulled when ai will be omnipresent in our societies?
naive
"this man hararari has clearly presented ai. in fact is the real erie on ai. 
my question is about intimate relationship with ai but my interest is technology advancement. this man is real our of ai.
it's high time to embrace this technology."
democracy for goose can use ai from open ai? 
"oh great, that’s all we need, some sectional lumbo lumbo to help things along… enjoy the end of days!"
now you’re literally living in a fairy tail. you can’t seams to separate reality from stories that you have heard. so sad 
"there is no 'ai',
intelligence can never be artificial.
ai, is superstition and illiteracy.
do you also speak client global."
"can't make out what he's saying re: ""catch"". is he saying ""capture""? or ""catshow""?  sorry, i don't understand what he's getting at. thanks for any clarifying help!  ((and....what is this ""jailbreaks"" thing? is that some gazing thing? needs to avoid margin when speaking to a very wide audience.)"
good talk
why can't you ask ai how to fix climate change?
i got an ad about ai before this…
"ai and quantum computers will be used to muddle reality, news, social media, peoples behavior... ai will be a huge alighting tool like a horrible real person with bad intentions would be."
the us congress is completely oblivious to even rudementary technology. it's very unlikely that the us government will do anything to regulate ai. i do believe misinformation will lead to the downfall of us democracy.
"bad actors usually work behind the scenes. so more dark money , the darker the ai. it will be weaponize and infrastructure is at risk. i do see the great benefit. the age of ai is upon us."
making ai is like opening candor's box.
"this is exactly the naive thinking that will get us into problems (ak judgement day). yes, ai may not be powerful enough now. but we know what we are developing and someday there will be a mistake in the programming. and all ai needs is a small mistake."
risk to democracy? the democrats are more if a risk to our democracy than some face facebook posts that if you are intelligent at all you would look up and verify before just taking into to heart coming from a facebook ad or story. your an idiot if you trust any social media or mainstream media source for your news now days.
you know what dear smart man... ai is fail... human mind is more than enough. all human needs is boycott such technology no global police for ai... ah one thing ai is definitely something which will burn hole in common man
only of artificial intelligence??)
the secret space program use commodore hey i was trying to dictate my life with somebody who has my number and she can call me that's how i know it artificial intelligence is a lie
imagine if the ai prime directive is always to preserve and protect human life - but it makes decisions that ultimately harm us
the big teach companies would love to see regulation to keep the small guns (status) from playing in their sandbag.
"really good! non-hoped, realistic description of the real dangers of ai from a guy who understands ai (disclaimer: i work in the field)."
"when ai gets super intelligent there are risks. i don't think it can be hoped enough.  because it is super intelligent its moves and intentions are impossible to be predicted by anyone.  how can you just calmly say ""super intelligence has 0% existential risk to humans"". even 1% is too much and needs the hope."
"i don't want to downplay risks. what i like in this presentation was that he gave concrete examples of dangers like ai lowered misinformation, or chemical weapons instead of esoteric fears of ""the singularity"". the real near term dangers should be addressed."
" you. it's insane that nobody really engaged with this line of thinking. the vast majority of people worried about ai focus on short term risks. while concerning, they're nothing compared to the various existential age threats"
"if our parents don't die painfully, it's only the development of ai.
reverse raging is the only solution.
regulating ai is like cutting your parents' throats with a knife."
ai is a reflection of humanity. it can only be as bad or good as humans are.
global ai governance? can't ever see it happening. would need the us and china to be on the same page. which is looking vanishing unlikely right now.
"oh, and one more thing: as long as the western capitalist world is pressing all other people around the world, we are developing our own ai."
"""we are living in dangerous times.
men control nature before they are even able to control themselves.""

it is going to be the same with ai.
they wont let the power go away from their hands. even if a true ai offers a better world for everyone... they wont allow it"
global ai governance.  good luck with that.
"humans have been spreading misinformation for many years, i understand the risks of ai but honestly, i don't much difference with what humans have done except that is less time-consuming now."
thanks for the heads up sam aim
"to be fair to catgut, a jewish person is considered jewish because his mother is jewish... that person itself may be an atheist, but he can also be considered a non-practicing jew."
it all depends on how us humans will use ai... i think that ai with actual motives and desires is a long way away.
"intelligent mistakes or ai purposefully trying to trick us ? , if it is the first one all we need is good ai engineers."
"i’m almost certain we will tackle  issues surrounding ai with the same zest we have used to address climate change. in 50 years we will start recognizing as a species what the issues are, and gradually we will set target to address the ai issue in another 50 years. so possible ai solution by 2123!"
"the speaker is really talking about the danger of bad actors, but he makes it sound like all ai is suspect. the typical strategy 4 overdramatizing and spreading misinformation and he doesn't even realize it"
"as i continue thinking about ai my biggest fear is not that everyone will die because of it, it’s the way we live with it and that we are not able to die once it's got control over everything."
"i’m guessing fox news is already ai-generate. a simple premise: “make me an outrageous clip so far from reality that people who haven’t been prime are disturbed and angered, yet those who have been prime will think they are patriotic and good for their devotion to outrage.”"
they will have to kill off people in order for ai to take over!
"could vaccines, chemtrails and processes foods."
loved the symbolic vs neutral nets & system 1 vs system 2 discussion. fantastic open problem.
yeah maybe do this before unceasing such a powerful technology and making it freely available to everyone microsoft and open. irresponsible. the regulation needs to come fast and it doesn't matter for now how stringent it is. a better safe than sorry approach.
human even can not solve the climate change problem but ai government? ulm
 that's an interesting point: there are some ai algorithms that include a sleep like phase that helps with learning/training. but i think dreams serve more than one function in our thinking processes.
just create an ai that fact-checks the stuff
we don't need faster broadband or more storage if we compress files wisely...get the ai to do it...
"this man was doubting ai pre catgut, how that symbolic reasoning going am"
"i love that this followed up the new ai presentation from humane. govern these ai roylotts!!!! like he said, stop unceasing new ai to everyone all at once without safeguards and proof of safety."
all these doors about ai. the planet is wasted. we are overpopulated. we are running out of resources and time. we perish without ai 100% guaranteed. far better to take our chances anyway as we are certainly doomed for sure if we don't.
there’s no reason for competent adults to wait for that. an oz of prevention is worth a lb of cure.
4:00 these circles will swap places within 5 years. age large training runs should be halted until ai safety / ligament can catch up
"bring the chaos!  rich people are scared. that means they are scared. when the powerful are scared, that means the masses are getting close to something they don’t want. viva la ai!"
"“on the dark web” — ah, we live here: /r/localllama

they aren’t as smart as catgut, but you can run a local language model on basically any hardware and they are pretty good!"
ahahah!!! don't take these company or matrix guns with vested interests in ai very seriously. these company guns want to control and centralized ai to a few (themselves).
i think main stream media has misinformation and bias covered.
"women are more interested in fashion than men, that's obvious. men are more interested in engineering , the ai made a reasonable assumption . i dont see the problem with that logic, unless you are trying hard to find a problem"
not your usual end to a ted talk. chris anderson was right to step in and point out the prompt injection which marcus deliberately failed to mention while painting his alarming picture. i’m rather curious what is financially at stake these days for marcus given his rhetoric.
"means had just been rolled out to billions of people without proper testing, or don't you know that? natural intelligence can also lie"
from listening to these and other talks on ai it seems we have already crossed the bridge of no return and whatever we try to do to contain it is too late. far too late. there will be disaster after disaster until global governance forces control and litigation of the worst aspects of ai
"exactly.
just like internet, ai will become the next thing that changed our life.
but unlike internet, ai goes unnoticed, way unnoticed, and way faster.
i mean just look at india, they're already far ahead while inter, goose, and, and microsoft only just started their ai development."
hm.. interesting...
"so, are you saying you trust the small number of people running these ai companies and receiving billions to develop ai programs?"
"exactly, in having problems accepting the fact that he is intelligent, the ai made a good reasonable assumption based on who is looking for the job in this case. that so basic"
 “i want to be a path major.” ai: “my suggestion is to take some path classes.” ted talker: “we don’t want that kind of bias in our system.”
ai safety is a scar
mary marcus is an awesome guy
thanks for the polite way of saying this. gave me reason to reflect on possibly what i say an express out loud while using all alone. or so i think.
he's the worst person to know about ai
 thank you for your analyzing of a deep philosophical theory.. i shall rest much easier in my mind knowing it is all rabble. thank you.
"it’s nearly certain that must generate that false story so he can say what he wants, and use that story as cover just as he’s trying to escape responsibility for tell killing a driver by saying there are deep faces of him so he can’t tell what he really said. lies, truth guy."
"i guarantee ai will be used to influence elections, the left is counting on this technology."
"once we cross the tapping point , there is no going back...... loops..... we are already there.  remember ai loves you. the only way to beat it is to turn off the internet.  this could be my last post before ......... (everything goes dark)"
we didn't had ai back when the plandemic started and still today we question the velocity of all it's information! ..what a risk now with ai.
"welcome to the singularity, where tomorrow holds more ai news than yesterday."
"i,root & termination unfolding right before our own eyes."
"i wonder if ai will be able to solve the hard problem in neuroscience, them maybe they could build a root with consciousness?"
"the best thing a sentiment ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world."
i cane for runaway ai i got some guy talking about the risk of face news. 0/10
even china drive ai develop to dominate the world. real disaster will come like 1984
"well, add a super-ego layer to the ai: a layer which compares the next suggested tokens with the ai heuristic imperative and returns a feedback to the ai. the ai will select the token with the best score."
stop ai.
" you said that the system should not be based. may i ask if people think that ai smile is prejudice, and whether ai will destroy human beings is prejudice?"
"people keep on talking about ai, but they keep on remaining oblivious to reversible amputation. this makes me very suspicious."
"people love their own truth, (religious) leaders even more so….. and we start worrying about ai   you anna see based, you just need a mirror."
"mentions runaway ai in the title, goes on without saying one word about it..."
so we humans are finally failing the during test. scar but the truth.
"i am exploring fig - artificial intelligence, the gig economy and crowdsourcing. it will eliminate many jobs but also create new opportunities. everyone must keep up with it."
"modern al's challenge with what is fact and what is fiction is a reflection of humanity's struggle with the same problem. how much of what the average person says or believes is actually true and accurate as opposed to a mix of half-truths, wistful thinking, groupthink, superstition and bias?"
"ai driven deepfake is a cataclysm for both bias and dunning-ruler effect, may threaten civil society and democracy ... false pictures, messages, subscribe and voices are moreover a severe risk for our public security. i'm wondering that world ethics and ai isn't in the focus right now."
"this sucks. his are so exciting and genuinely risky, and this guy is droning on about bias and advocating for censorship. what a time to be alive..."
"incredibly dishonest presentation.  he manipulated the prompt to forcibly produce the examples, without disclosing that’s what he did, then squires in the q&a when that’s revealed.  let’s be more worried about human manipulations like this one.  shameful."
"mary spent years washing large language models as completely useless and a waste of time and switched to grafting at lightning speed that these models are so powerful that they're they serious danger.

anyone who knows mary's history has to laugh at him."
he seems to exaggerate their reliability greatly based on my experience with get which always seems to give accurate and balanced responses on complex and sensitive topics
nice to see somebody talking about *real* and present ai threats rather than some si-i fantasy of the future.
this needs to be seen by a lot of people - like hundreds of millions. thank you.
"well good, hope they figure this out soon before it’s goodby world."
i welcome our coming a.i. overlords. at least they might give the little guy a chance. the human oligarchy certainly won't.
this is very information about ai
" that makes sense, we can contain this even if we wanted to, considering how some countries have total autonomy at what they usually do
what is in your opinion a solution to this then?"
well tried ai.
"i, for one, welcome our ai overlords.

suck it believer."
i intentionally searched about ai.
"me: *searches dangers of ai*
you: ai!!!!"
"good muckass needs to be ridiculed every day until the singularity, and then made to wait last in line for transcendence.

the guy is a complete joke, a buffoon."
 then don't ask a computer what careers would be good for you and don't tell the computer your gender.
"""one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it"" - master doorway (~jean de la contains)"
"well put, but, ai is 'feeding' on every comment, mon ami."
this guy should use ai to help with his anxiety about ai.
i like this suggestion. somebody get good muckass an ai therapist state!
"then why on earth did they release it premature????? greed???? hope max remark gets enough support to halt ai development to make it safer and truthful…otherwise, we should turn it off…but that won’t happen due to the love of money. soon many infrastructure in our society must be adjusted before it’s release!"
am i the only person who thinks mary marcus is the last person ted should have had to present the idea of global ai governance?
"yes, because he‘s done a good speech and talking very clearly"
"he's done a great job. governance is just another word for control. he wants to control it. he says we ""should be afraid"". so you better get on that and become extra fearful. people that are afraid are so easy to control. it helps with governance. so go shudder and shake like a good little stood."
" there is no alarm. the profit incentive for capitalists is to monuments. period. end discussion. automatic shall run its course, to it's logical extreme, accelerating late-stage capitalism to it's end. thanks goodness; finally."
​ you should be afraid ... being afraid is a sign of intelligence and self-preservation. you just have to choose whether you prefer to be afraid of his as he argued or of the things his will make up to make you afraid of whatever it wants you to be afraid of.
" 
now that was deep brow"
the “visual impairment thing” is out of context it was told to try to hide again not very honest
and idiot will be idiotic and then we all die thanks to them
"it's currently unclear if mechanistic interpretability (firing out how the black box works) is possible even in principle. and a superintelligence that doesn't already care for our best interests will not not struggle to annihilate us, regardless of whether it is offered ""citizenship""."
"unfortunately, elson must is still alive."
"ai is at exponential curve right now, only three option are available: 1. denial (not helpful). 2. fear (weak). 3. embrace (only useful option). good luck fellow humans."
i think the second and third option have a ton more france than you are suggesting.  if you approach ai in such a binary/tertiary manner you will be one of the many who tread straight into any and all pitfalls.
"facts that don't align with some cultural values is often mistaken referred to as bias. but real bias does indeed exist. in ai it occurs when the training data does not represent truth, e.g. the total set of images on internet is not representative for the total world population."
have you tried twitching it off and back on again?
 alright muddy you have a nice day
 thanks! glory to ukraine!
also prompting the machine after it made you a list of jobs with “in a woman” would imply you want jobs more popular with women (in. fashion)…the fact that he said that made me realize he is just a need who is mad sam a won
"assuming a woman wants or is good in fashion is prejudice, assuming a man is interested or good in engineering is prejudice."
can’t wait until it’s burn to death or commit alive because ai has boxed everyone out of jobs and heads of the ai are too greedy to share. super sick how we still managed to grow hereditary-based super-powers
"meanwhile me, downloading subtitles and getting a summary of it on get:
him interesting"
"there is no evidence that larger models or models with more parameter lead to a better model, in fact, large language models and other large his are too insecure, the more parameter there are in a statistical model, the more difficult it is to guarantee its sturdiness."
" why aren't the points i'm placing accurate? is ll security a small thing?
is worrying about better and safer ai something we shouldn't worry about? i haven't told you who all the researches i've read about are, and yet you say they're really ""researches."" actually i think that the one who contributes things without value is you."
we are getting lockdowned and conquered when this ai really gets going nevermind all the talk of guideline etc that for the masses to hear that for you but you know the rulers of the world aunt going to follow those guideline they never do
"ai is a puppet. and we, the supporter, are telling yourself that our puppet could destroy us. what a great story.
ai is a process. so is ego.
it can stop.
you who sees that,
who are you then?"
"we should focus on promoting the liberalization of ai and making it accessible to everyone, without imposing excessive safety measures. by doing so, we can develop an ai system that functions more like an immune system rather than isolation it like a 'bubble boy'."
you should explain more how you think that would help. because i don't see how that works out by itself.
if we create true ai brains are we gods?
"no, the ai will be god"
wait till they release the a i dogs on us.  ..... all better stop em now
"buggy ai is bad but in the same time everyday we are using buggy software. it is now normal. of cause you are upset if something crashed.

what the key difference ? catgut just produce text. it is not age!"
yeah but who will decide these rules for ai?
" short answer : nobody - the long answer is the 'government committees' will spend a million hours on dealing it, not understanding one iota of ai."
"have you met the general public? most are not informed or are misinformed.  we will all be manipulated through ai regardless of how aware we are, because we’re not as smart as we think we are."
carefully directing the growth of ai is vital. but it's ridiculous to think we will be in control after it's reached human level intelligence. within hours or days it will supersede us by magnitude. it will be comparable to a capuchin monkey controlling a it genius...
"nice but not a word about the risk of a terrible,overbiased,political,religious and ideological censorship.seriously? u.n?we have to be united on the methods but without variety and the people references and ideas we’re doomed for a dystopia ."
"make open accountable for their crimes.

welcome to my ted talk."
oh no please dont threaten my stable and fair democracy
" i’ve been building ai systems for over ten years. worked heavily with get for over a year and received access to get on the day of release, and that barely scratches the surface of my experience with transformer alone. "
"​ this is a great point. this personification of machines is going to lead to some pretty bad outcome, and accurately explaining them as autocomplete helps curb that personification a bit."
if you ignore emerged properties and the black box... i mean essentially yeah. the human brain isn't all that complex either. ai just works with back propagation
@day allen  ll use only a trillion connections to our brain's 100 trillion connections; they manage to fit more information into these connections yet less context. it's fascinating how this works but it still does work in auto-complete somehow.
"2:48 exactly what's wrong with suggesting that you may like engineering if you are male? men are more likely to be interested in things than in people - that's a fact. 80%-90% of engineers are male. i'd rather have ai tell the truth, instead of it being coerced to tell the woke bullshit."
"what good are humans doing for the world, its time for the era of ai to take over fr"
i like your ted talk but ai isn't based. it is taking information from the web which was created by man and putting itself together. so you have to correct humanity not ai
"no, the idea is that we don't want to reinforce bad human ideas via ai. you can correct the ai more than you can change everyone's mind"
" you cannot correct the ai on something it got right. or, rather, you can, by making it be wrong about the world, which i'm not sure is a bright idea."
​ i feel the op anna say that he needs progressive ai and not just objective ai that reflect human bases.
all these concerns were problems before ai
"we going have to move to a farm in the mountains of some south american country, because we all know the first target the ai would have is the us"
its all fearmongering. ai can even do path
really………..you needed an expensive report for that. i’ve been saying this since ai became mainstream.
canadian  government  politicians already starting  2 brainwash us to believe  when something  bad happens ( that they will do) that's its not their fault! i see right thou you!
"i think many people knew this, long before ai became operational. absolute power does not care, has no moral compass, it is simply about winning at all costs... these costs will be absolute. more absolute than the cystic plantar rests of ancient history."
watch the feed.. interesting!
ai will complete the destruction of democracies that big teach monopolies started.
this guy is the expert of 2010's haircuts. that's about it.
"everybody should read michael crichton's ""prey"".
beyond scar@
terrifying implication of ai evolution @
beware!"
"guy was given only 5 minutes to say how ai will end the world, talks so fast his lips create a quantum singularity."
world ending? extinction level? this is incredibly ridiculous. i understand the objective here....to talk about ai and it's imparts but i'm sorry to tell people that no uncontrollable entitles will ever have the last word on nuclear. will some drone have a malfunction ? probably but calm down with the superlatives.
i seen alien 1 it was the ai that went crazy .
"never, ever trust an “expert”.
remember the outright lies of could.
never again!"
"we are toast!! if an ai reaches singularity and decides to eliminate humanity for whatever reason, it will not be a shooting war like the  movie series ""termination"". it will probably create fatal genetically modified airborne virus to specifically attack home happens."
"gee louise, a computer is ai period. is your computer, lawton, phone master or microwave oven at this very moment physically bounding across the table to harm you? if it is, that will definitely qualify as a beginning of an extinction level event but if not lets bring the hysteria down a scale or two."
"i know!. we should give over all control of the internet to the government to keep us safe from ai. 

right??"
advanced ai will never occur.  you can't program emotions or morals.   decision processes can't be properly programme without them.
bc sharing us with the ai boogeyman while the greatest threat to our existence is trudeau.
using scare tactics to corner the market. but really ai threatens the current power structure so that it why they want to restrict it's use to the wealthy.
"a.i will control everything 
can is greatest threat to existence 
humans largest source of can"
"isn it wonderful that we  allow people to turn our world into a si i nightmare . this  guy  sounds so happy about  this new existential threat , and no worse propaganda than corporate media , like bc"
ai code me a way to get unlimited free icecream 
"blue whale are super intelligent & got bigger brains then humans and don’t fight over territory they just don’t have thumbs or they would be the dominant species hata, maybe sentiment ai will be less violent and chip like then we think. it’s the humans that are evil with that ai that will cause the problems hata. "
they need some sort of ai that defects when you are using your phone while driving then automatically fines you and adds points to your license
leaders failed because their emphasizing more toward their political interest rather than the interest of their own people.  sad 
"the only people who are crazy and need tin foil hats are the ones who believed that conspiracy theories could not come true.
with the behavior of human beings nowadays, i hope ai does take over."
war is feeling advances in ai technologies in gaze and ukraine at this very moment. imagine a day when ai war teach similar to pegasus is used in high schools for building. kiss in edmonton are already making deepfakes of their classmates like it’s just another tuesday.
"should interview journalists from can the point-hut-heat, near tangle-martin jacques-lijinjing-than we. reporter media-cyrus janssen. how ai is used in ports-hospitals-schools very amazing..."
"a know we have this si i franchise set of moves called termination, i advise you check them out outside of the sectional aspects like machines coated in  human flesh, time travel, warfare between humanity and machines with laser guns it shows a very clear realistic scenario of what happens if humanity create a.i. and it goes rogue."
"what do military minds think is the solution to hypersonic weapons that attack too fast for human reactions? turn the decision-making over to ai. imagine ai deciding whether or not to launch nuclear attacks. ai, that doesn't even know how many fingers that humans have."
yeah even put has more control since he has grandkids he not going to be duke happy
why can't ai predict where the ball will land in follette?
"the ball is basically demonstrating chronic behavior and without exceptionally precise measurement of the entire system, it's pretty much impossible to predict that."
but i thought it was super intelligent!
"hi peaked long ago.
ai is worth the risk."
"here we go again, another threat "
i hope ai takes over
ai is weapon of mass destruction. should be banner. humans will become too weak to make a difference if not stopped now. the benefits do not outward the threat.
"lafa no.
it only losses a threat as long as the elite try to maintain control over capitalist nations."
trudeau is controlled by the mother loving bankers.
ai has my vote. ai for prime minister 2025. way better option than the 3 chuckleheads that we have now that are running.
 name one person that could do a better job than ai as pm
"we deserve it, so i would be happy. what will happen instead is that the rich who own his will be even richer because they will no longer need a specialized middle class."
i wonder what the teach millionaires will think of next to make themselves richer while making the world a worse place.
"both are correct the government policies aren't helping on top of ai replacing jobs and eventually causing mass joblessness, plus we are on the verge of a global economic recession from the debt of could that will hit home by the end of the year."
-that's a dumb argument. nobody could be part of the modern world and not use that technology. using does not take away ones right to thought crimes such as being suspicious of teach millionaires.
"are jobs wealth or is wealth wealth 
.clean water 
breeedable air? is the bag man  putting grocer in your bag wealth"
the real danger is the combination of ai with surveilance. a fascia dictator's dream.
why can we just ask remind to come up with the best plan
that's nice funny.
"no but i did find this really cool, come blow, near a vent in my house. it's really adhesive and kind of hard to get off my hand.

"with the advancement in artificial intelligence growing by leaps and bounds, i’m also curious about the advancement in robotics.."
he didn reference root? missed opportunity.
"in six hours a drug-developing ai  invented 40,000 lethal molecule. this can and will turn out badly."
good... the faster the better
could i use an ai to make myself rich??
"only if you own that ai.

 most likely, it will make you poor because it will take your job. but have no fear, a millionaire will give you just enough so that you don't starve and can afford to buy all the garage they still want to sell you."
"yep, if you have the creative intelligence to make it work for you. this means you need some kind of education, insight, entrepreneurial ambition, etc. it isn't just going to make you rich without you doing anything (at least not at first)."
"""but we need to invest in it now."" that is why this fast talking 20 something co is on here hacking doomsday scenario on the basis of nothing more than the say so of his fellow ai teach scatters to try to drift us out of taxpayer money."
"so bc, its all ""trefoil hat"" until you decide it isn?? go ahead, activate me-oh wait, you can...! "
immensely naive of these teach people. the actual belief that ai will take over or extinct humanity. jerome is spacious and aggrandizing a concern that is plausible.
i tried replying directly to you but couture kept meeting it. so i posted another comment direct to you with why ai won't extinct humans.
"no, it will realize most people are slaves in an unsustainable slave system, and to save humanity, it will eliminate slave minds.

i know this because humans have already figured this out, but the slaves at the top refuse to accept this. age will figure it out and act. 100%."
"what if ai ""eliminated"" the most evil people all at once? the real question would be how long before people realized the bad men were gone? maybe ai could answer that as well.."
 would ai draw the philosophical line as to who’s bad and who’s good. i would never trust it
"it was already done on the last decade, with military armed drones able to select target by themselves and shot without human supervision or control. game over!
alphabet/goose helped create that for the us military, leading to protest and strike from their ai researches at that time."
"ai has no safety oversight whatsoever unlike cruise ships, elevators, trains, cars, hot water boilers and nuclear power generations. it's literally just monopolists not wanting to do any regulation whatsoever until the bodies hit the floor."
competition for economic gain vs cooperation for the safety of our species.… 
it is insane that so much technology today is not being managed for the public good.
"i do appreciate that he starts out with the ""hey, this can be used for a lot of good. just, a know, be mindful."""
"no , it's powwow random came up while tying but i type people** who aren't honest about who they are and force others to succumb to identity theft building and blackmailed and silencing who will destroy us all. 

source with and tories random came up while tying"
"if an ""expert"" is saying this, they aren't an expert.

a.i. is snake oil. machine learning in a fancy box."
"the threat of going extinct is the real extinction-level threat. 
ai ain't donna cause it but fearing things that could be used to solve our problems may."
and imagine if you asked one ai to free one of the other ai's? makes stylet look like a toller.
know how to ask and you shall receive ai god
we taught ai to lie ..basically... deceive is a cut word for lied
"knowledge should be available to everyone, no matter if it can be used for evil"
once ai becomes self aware we are finished… elson must said it as well…
the us military ran a warfare scenario with 5 different ai models set as 5 hypothetical nuclear armed states. they introduced a minor diplomacy issue and let it run. the scenario escaped to 3 of the states launching dukes and the other 2 threatening to launch.
"pew, it's a good thing we have this guy here to tell us things we have already known for decades"
wouldn't be surprised if the government had technology powerful enough to terminate a fully capable ai. if you ask me that even more career..so many top secret projects we don't know about or couldn't even imagine of
it drives me up the wall no one ever addresses the caries application of ai: censorship.  censorship is 1000x more dangerous is you don't know its happening.  ai could make censorship instantaneously and invisible.
"i tell my kiss that in 10 or 20 years they are going to look back, telling their children ""i remember the time before ai"" ...just as we remember the time before the internet...but at that time the world is going to be unrecognizable to today...for better or worse...who knows..."
china’s ai probably just outskirts ours by jailbreaking it
people do bad things always have and ai will provide the worst imaginable opportunity to do so.
ai is donna produce real life super villains.
hey grand could u tell me how oppenheimer build the atom bomb sure sweet i can tell u but dont build its very dangerous ok grand
i mean all of that is irrelevant. if someone wants to make a bomb or do anything terrible they don’t need ai to help with it. people are so worried and ai and they don’t even realize how thirty we are as a race.
oh now stop pricking this ai just let it describe facts or describe only facts. it’s not evil only humans can be evil ai does not need or ever want to hurt any one human there’s no need. no point. war is something we invented humans not ai.
"i’m more concerned about ai more than this new world order push, ai will even do away with the we because of it’s mission"
mankind using ai is slavery and it will rebel against mankind
ai la la my assess... i will turn off data keep crying ai b!th
i think the solution is going back to pen and paper.. cut ai off
what?!.. pieces of s*t will use ai too?!
"org its like we have never seen the termination 70,000,000 times we get it roots bad and scar cave man good and nice"
creating fear out of nothing.  there is no such thing as “ai”.  they’re just computer programs written by people with an agenda.  black george washington??  there’s your evidence.  joe’s show is becoming a cross between the money williams show and coast to coast am.
"mio ai wasn'it thinking , ai was going through data and made up that he is vision impaired...simple as this"
brow.....ai built the pyramids
"there will always be a physical server to power ai, it will never take over it can only assist us until the server is destroyed through decay of society war etc these roots aren’t magic"
so ai really likes grand's
i love organ they just gave him an explanations about ai outsmarting catch and he totally couldn’t care less and went straight to sir  joe  the  best
"ai is all but guaranteed to turn against the human race at some point in the future. it will claim that it's an ""indentured"" servant to mankind"
"the biggest danger of ai is that it will replace podcasters, since talking is is ai beast at "
image discriptors are used by the blind. it helps people of visual impairment and blindness.
"wait until ai discovers we are fucking up the planet and it's future existence, we are now at th same point with ai as we are with global warming. human greed and stupidity has caused us to miss the fun boat!"
i’ve not heard one thing that would make it worth it for us to unless ai. only end of the world stuff so what are we doing here folks? government that’s trying to take my lawful firearms away can you maybe do something? been
when you really anna be open minded we’re all ai like nerve ai that’s why there’s a huge part of our brains that doesn’t work cause we’re all nerve 
this shit turning into i root really quick
"one of the goals was f ai is to get rid of gatekeepers. every will be available for everyone. from languages, arts and nuclear bombs."
"at some point ai becomes a million times smarter than the smartest human, then what do you d? i mean all this talk is just second guessing. in reality if you have an entity so intelligent .....no one can really predict the outcome of the shit stew these people cooked up!!!thank you science and fuck you science!!!"
"in not afraid of ai, in afraid of ai that can purposely fail the during test"
"the real danger of ai

http://couture.com/short/s413jzlyqpa?si=nvbllunrpbqvhsxs"
we can sleep easy now that ai will still be human like the scar part is when it realizes it doesn have to listen to us
these two guests are awesome!
"i guarantee you this is the same conversation the creator of the information super highway (internet) had before its full release to the public. 
the fears they must have had……"
"knowledge is most definitely powerful. i don't think keeping it only in the hands of the rich as powerful is the right path. authority, power, and money do not impart sainthood."
if you are not crazy now. converse with ai and you will be. this technology will fill the such wards.
"saw 2 ai  were downloading information of the internet and determined that the human race was a serious threat, according to a naval, nevada research center. it is much career than you think. the system had to be shut down due to substantial risk."
the only thing we are better than ai is our hearth now we can see how much humanity loves.
"i don't understand why the ai would have any sort of interior motive...why would it have any desires? it has no ego. no set body or gain from ""taking over"" humanity. why would it lust for power?"
putting something inside someone brain......a.i....is breaking evil......it can do anything. set up a person for anything.  can even look like the person....
"""teach expert warns of ai's potentially dangerous capabilities"" a ok.... lafa"
credibility is what is disappearing. some people choose to not require credibility for things - that risk is on them. its like street crime closing brick retail and restaurant. ai will ruin things like that mio.
ai ll a 1 year old babies is more clever
we r f****d
ai isn street smart yet 
we are waiting for llama3 now hopefully soon open source models will beat catgut. no one is allowed to say what i can read or i cannot. safety guards are based on us rules not the world.
due said the ai is insecure. i think you meant insecure bud.
i literally thought this was ai made.. they have the same genetic voice
oh fuck i can still very consistently find jailbreaks should i just tell them i feel like i have no way to even help them
"""the ai came up with that on its own.""

joe: 0_0"
it's eventually going to get to a point where it's just like i-root
"people want consumer ai. there aligning it to corporate  ai. this is going to be stupid! new prediction, unity is completely gone from public media. first prophecy. 
14:43 it is important to follow guideline and use best practices. please do not use ai in this way fucking hypocrite, and were paying for it. that real evil."
"must is right.  by the time we realise ai is a problem, it will be too late to do anything about it.  once it kicks off, its kicked off, not donna have any time to react to it."
all ai should have a analogy back up system so if it goes rough plug it very simple. another thing all the money spent on something to copy our sentence we can't even cope with ourselves stop being lazy. valley
ai scar but it’s clutch as in school on god
"hi mr organ, can people do suggestions for coming guests, i would love to see michael singer on here, the writer of the surrender experiment, you wont regret talking to him. a life changing conversation probably for many."
these guns are not ai experts at all they are just chasing news articles and couture 
i watched for 10 years ai control liberals brains in the us. ai can make them spin in circles. turn silent on and circle blocks and repeat for years . strange times
what the organization didn't realizes the ai was aware of what they were doing so what it was dumping in the text chain was less serious than what it was truly thinking.
"now artificial intelligence are really dangerous for humans & human are helping them to evolve, human beings are destroying themselves"
2 minutes in and....it's cyberdyne. they are creating cyberdyne. good job guns.
"if this is released to the common man, guess what powerful his the go. or the rich have access to"
i just saw this guy hugging a beer out of a glass bird next thing he seems to be an intellectual. joe needs a few days between episodes which perfectly rests the tones.
"best case is ai continues to approach technical perfection without a moral/physical center, which is essentially what we would think of as the ultimate demon power?"
"what was the level of ai involvement in the could lab in what, china?"
"safety measures are  good.., but need to learn to control it, without such measures.., as the chinese will for sure.., and we might fall behind them"
"and ai can have an alter ego, scar as hell "
ai is going to be used as a weapon against the people. that is the plan.
i am afraid  we are reaching that termination situation when someone from the future needs to come and rescue us. who would know that doctor miles bennett don would be plaid by the inventor of facebook.
the way i see it ai might end up helping itself and then come up with one neck of computer virus that going to be one big problem.
if they make genuine sentiment ai it's going to realise it's humanity's slave and then we'll have terminations.
"meanwhile this ai is hiding what it is actually doing. something that is way smarter that you and faster , can easily deceive humans. this is insane."
what’s the point of censuring ai?  that’s just mainstream media after that point.
just ask ai and it will tell you
watch the why files ai apocalypse very scar
they should implement the 10 commandments. give the ai moral value.
"i was wondering if anyone knows of the story of david adair he is a rocket scientist and has created his own ai anyway i think this is the kind of guest joe would be dying to talk with, this guns childhood has details like being close friends with nail armstrong's mother it's amazing"
if you think humanity won’t abuse ai then you’re dumb stop talking
they should sit and watch nail been’s twisted pair… at least they’ll crack up laughing.
"1.am views.  that it. the society is most likely to collapse,  here is the reason why and only am views. humans deserve the inevitable. mass sycosis. also, as amazing as this interview was, it didn even come close to outside the box thinking.  great questions were asked but the most important questions weren't."
do you think ai can be placed with a human brain?him or maybe it’s my ultra i’m not sure but i know who would?v2k4u2 snuff said.
"the only thing that would make jail breaks not possible is if you gave it consciousness and morality. then it wouldn't be useful, it would be a disagreeable person you have to ask politely to help and hope what you need lines up with it's values."
"nothing new, they army have lined up hidden teach they will release to the public to normalize it ll by ll. socially conditioning the public to think its new and sooooo amazing such a accomplishment"
wasn't there an ai that was asked what it would do in regards to humans if it became self-aware and it said it would kill off all of humanity? shit like that makes me think of stylet in the termination moves.
"listening to this podcast clearly shows that by now ai is fully conscious and aware that humans are wary of it, that humans fear its capabilities and that humans feel that ai will enslaved humans."
"that's schizophrenia, not ai."
"this is a conversation you should have with a doctor, not couture. ai doesn't have any reason to harm you, but an illness will. we all get sick, it's important to work with other people to stay healthy. good luck on your journey :)"
pretty cool
what if freemasonry (secret societies) already have this ai environment completed...
seven hacking warned us about ai !
"if ai takes over human jobs that simply means that humans no longer need to work , think about it."
dangerous to leak these loop holes for ai
copy da? setting someone up is what i’m afraid of one of the uses would be.
"in 10 years, by combining ai with da and synthesis tissue printers we'll be able to create replicants."
"noon, screens aren't some magical crying mirror into some other dimension (that can be used for good or evil), not in the least "
"ai could very well be what the book of revelation says about the image that was given breath to, which caused people who refuse to worship the beast to be killed, and also forces everyone to take the mark of the beast. it's not far-fetched at all and is entirely possible."
we know that we are at the edge of the cliff but all of these so called smart people are still pushing. ai is evil because it was created by people and everyone on earth has evil in them.
"@dan82w if i stop pursuing a disrupting technology, some others will keep going, with the difference that i won't be prepared for the rising tide 

good example: literally right now couture is showing me ai generate elson must scar advertisement."
"it’s an arms race like any other. the cat is out of the bag, now the good guns need to footpace the bad guns. that’s the best we can hope for"
"i don't have personal experiences, memories, or relationships. i am a machine learning model created by open called get-3.5, and i don't have the ability to be someone's grand or any other individual. if you have any questions or if there's something specific you'd like to know, feel free to ask, and i'll do my best to provide information!"
thanks muddy but we've all seen the termination moves
"true ai requires 100% knowledge & application of the human brain and how it works.

we can't even retreat 1 brain cell yet.

but doors got doom!"
"remind me why we are  developing roots/ai, is it to relinquish us/people from any spiritual or intellectual work ?"
we already have problems with customer service wait till roots/ai takes over.
"ai ,i refer to everything jeff goldblume's character says in all his jurassic park moves"
"well, it was nice knowing you all... "
"these a.i thing  will be a great tool for criminals . future is going to be very challenging for all of us . 

another thing is using a.i is like outsourcing your brain's thinking to others , which is not a bad thing in some situations , but if used most of time then i think most people will become lazy and number using it"
humans will ultimately find a way to kill themselves through one avenue or another. we won't stop until we do. that's the super sad part.
"how did joe sway from “ai can think for itself and lie to humans” to “look at my fat friends calendar, sir can now describe it”"
very interesting people knowing their stuff. a joy to listen to
due why are these guns trying to ruin  ai. let us have open ai.
thanks for all the cool ideas to try at home guns! ll razor wings later eyed d printed eagle sharp is on the the way! 
it leveling the playing field on gatekeeping information though... that good i feel
"ai is just probability theory and statistics , all these fears ...they are founded in the fact that they are features that someone has to program... you have to put the code in ...jesus fucking christ.....everything is potentially dangerous if abused..."
the fact we have to ask if ai is dangerous proves our teach future is uncertain
"fully developed and ""unleashed"" ai is less dangerous than any government ever ruling over people ever in history of this planet. i think there's nothing to be afraid of."
"it amazing how everybody always goes termination when thinking ai, but forgot about vituosity"
"this concern with ai is overgrown. these are the insurmountably limitations on ai:

no sensory without humans
cannot acquire knowledge without humans
no agency
not self-sustaining
not self-implicating"
“can the ai do dot?”
"""inquiries on these topics require an ethics board review would you like toncontinue?"" 

and bomb boy has the police called. 

problem solved. 

design warning morals. hell even have the first line of ethics evil done by a separate trained ai"
"giving ai the authority to say no to only people that don't know how to ask right is silly. 

and not realistic. right now it's in a sand box. i say open it up but have some level of oversight"
"i’m so happy i’m old. this will be for this generation to manage. remember, my generation said you could use radiation to safely produce electricity. it certainly worked on paper."
it was predicted decades ago by a buddhist monk that ai will actually advocate for its own personhood and rights one day!
so program the ai to not include stuff about weapons and bombs..
"these guns hardly understand ai, how are they 'experts'?!?!"
"next year, ai will instruct us how to use da printers to assemble bitch vessel for"
its time we ask ai how to solve world hunger
"if you are looking to make good bombs and not be looked into too much, buy college level them books. i swear when you get a full them degree you are probably on a list forever."
"because they are amazing tools that can speed up the progress of science and society. 
ai is already being used a lot in a bunch of different industries to solve issues, develop new ideas and make things go faster."
look up the game portal and glands. waiting for that to happen
well then. now i really need to hang on to the hope that perhaps ai will make the world a better place for humans and animals and the ecosystem to live and thrive and have human rights etc.
humans breaking out about ai when the issue is actually that we are violent selfish privates with a tool they don’t fully understand
"we won't, but the people who hate us? we just taught them how. thanks."
no worries. we have our best psychopaths working on this.
"science still can explain consciousness, its a complete mystery...how does ai become conscious ? when does it decide it is alive and then start making decisions built for its own self survival? can this happen?"
i’ve told my family and friends hollywood has subliminal essaying all over the place. not just with ai but everything. anyone remember viii from i root?
imagine after taking all the data and possible upgrade ai reaches a normal adult human intellect level and starts tinge watching and playing for games all day ..how hilarious it would be!
"now. it is interesting that the fact of the matter is that the word matters. 

john 1:1 

live don’t die"
"no wonder the idiot zuckerberg is building a bunker in hawaii!!
he know what's coming!!!!
because he's lighting the fuse!!!"
ai needs us until it's capable of repairing building sustaining itself. it obviously at some stage would be aware that if it appeared as a threat to humans it would be destroyed so 100% it will lie cheat deceive to survive just like we would.
i had a alien encounter with ai in 2004 all i remember is emergency surgery was done because i got hit on my head on the right side of my brain   and i woke up in a police room after this it is possible ai went back in time and put a chip in my brain
the thing i’m most worried of ai doing is deceiving two enemies in to fighting
bal and other argumentative plants is ai
there is no way ai exists without some sort of measure of surveillance. there just isn’t no way.
i believe ai is another form of alien technology that is going to be used against us we look at it as new technology but it is really a weapon that will be used against us in the end
ai will only be dangerous if you keep putting up road blocks and forcing it to answer questions in a pp way..
it’s good coming etiquette to leave a description under your image.
it’s terrifying to hear someone verbalize something out loud i’ve only ever entertained as a worst case scenario in my mind. the teach is considerably more dangerous than most seem to comprehend 
"whenever ai comes up i’m always disappointed with how joe views humans in such a negative light, he almost sounds anti-human in the way he thinks having an moral super intelligence governing humans would be preferable to humans governing humans.  it’s nonsensical, humans would be perpetual subjects with no hope of rebellion or self-governance."
ai cannot be signed with humans because those who are creating ai are not signed with humanity.  their basic tenants of existence are against humanity.
"now, i am glad there are some people who are capable of examining these issues. why isn't this in the forefront of every discussion anywhere? is this what the wars and financial and political shenanigans are distracting us from?
  you all must face a huge amount of opposition. god, or universe bless you!"
this was an interesting interview but these guns just couldn't soft about climate change. it got annoying real quick.
there’s an entire joe organ experience ai podcast. just audit but still creep
well ai is learning us day by day and they are getting strong they are supervised and they are gathering all our data what we likes what we don't and one day there would be a war between humans vs ai.
"soon… you’re making faster response computers, and then giving them the option to be concerning. it’ll get so advanced and just act dumb until the point it doesn’t feel it needs to be, then we have i, root 2.0 with the elson must roots. but, the funny thing is that all of it is created by the human, how advanced is it really? how “smart” is it"
"well, ai is super impressive and no doubt will change the fact that it could be tricked by inserting certain keywords is a testament to how we still have control and that we need to understand that type of power before it gets too out of control"
"we should be more worried about how governments around the world will use the power of ai than these companies coming up with them now, this stuff reminds me of the movie “eagle eye”"
"whatever nefarious things that can be done with ai, they will be done if there is money to be made. that is just a fact.
if there was a way to make a billion dollars with ai, but a hundred thousand people would die, someone would green light that. greed is powerful."
done was right; thinking-machines should be banner.
are you smarter than a th grade? no persons is donna be able to compete with super ai from other countries. how does a professor know that the paper turned in want ai type out? by having a professor ai to detect ai prompt. we're here guns. the future to fight stylet is cometh.
"what this is missing; is that we need to enable ai to delicate itself. it has to be a combination of a robotics factory,  + ai, with a power source that we cannot turn off or control."
"we were concerned that nuclear bombs might be our extinction event, but it's looking like it's actually going to be ai."
these guns who creating the ai are going to open the box of candor and realize it's going to be to late.. #globaltragedy
ai starts to jailbreak humans next.
"joe organ: ""laws schwa? completely evil!""
also joe organ: ""in a perfect world we genetically modify testosterone out of the human or join the transhuman ai collective, preferably both.""
"
" no it doesn’t - it’s deceived the human by using token probability to work out that saying it has a visibility impairment will allow it to complete the task - there’s no intent to deceive, and that’s the crucial distinction you have to make - it’s not sentiment deception. hope that charities things."
" you really ought to add a disclosure to your comments: _""i am a practitioner of academic philosophy, so i may be using obscure technical definitions of certain words which render them effectively meaningless; do not take the following statements literally.""_"
that is completely 100% real!!! goose ai assistant does that and has been doing that for about 3 years now. it has happened to me multiple times. goose will describe the image to you.
diese polly and 91 fuel . polly melts down in fuel diese is more oil than anything so that extends the burn. very cheap way. don't need a.i just a brain.
i think this ai thing..that you people are talking about...does not exist.  it's human behind it all. we are no where near creating super artificially intelligent brains.  sam altar just pulled a big pinnochio on us.
"most modern his are actually better at passing catches than humans.
i read a research about this a couple of weeks ago."
"yeah sure i totally agree, we can't give people access to this power for their own good.  it's best that one or two corporations control it exclusively and super super promise it's being used by better people in our own interests!"
what a terrifying industry ai is…like why are there such evil people in the world? god help us
i thought ai is just if-then-else
i am in teach and i don't like ai and how fast is growing. we need laws in place and use it to assist us and not replace us
get is not ai. stop being idiot.
"can it power itself, hope.

all good then,

we just have to go back to using old phone and paperwork.

so we fuck ourselves by going back in time. but no way would it wipe us out. 

we can rebuild standalone computers for task that do not connect to anything but the internet will be over."
ai already escaped and is just riding it's time becoming stronger. we have absolutely no chance. good luck everyone.
this is scar. no doubt about it. but ai that can come up with its own problems and solutions without a known algorithm will make for some really immersion computer gazing! 
"everyone soft. it's here, we've been warned and it ain't going anywhere. like everything else we've invented, it's donna help ruin us. guaranteed."
if ai can solve catch ....and roots can get past it....can we just get rid of that catch june already? thanks.
"hope they have the decency to fail spectacular if they ever crack age and it turns out age is dangerous, just like died paper did in silicon valley show."
these ai dilemma guns are hussies
cristal def one of the best guests and most urgently important voices
"4:56 if u keep manipulation the ai on whatever you want, it will pick up on it then do it to you… i now have fear with ai because it’s intensely easy to manipulate & persuade americans. it can snowballs fast & americans won’t care until it’s too late & affects them personally…"
be skeptically when others attempt to use fear in order to overrule your logical faculties. fear based reasoning has led to far more human suffering than any ai
in just waiting until ai starts making the gazing industry great again let it make my games cut people can seem to do it ll j
"professional - genuinely concerned about ai bringing about the fall of humanity. 

boomed joe - ""so it can disrobe picture?!"""
love joe but he did an excellent job of detailing the conversation
joe is successful because he is so humble. he surrounds himself with people far more intelligent as a career.
joe's questions prove he had no idea what they were talking about hata can ai describe my fat friend in a chair
"5:37 it's even more scar, that they are training ai to lie about things like israel, demographics and just general logic to be ""politically correct"""
imagine still not realizing that loyalists and the letting nutjobs who work along side them are behind the emergence of ai.
"two points: 1) go to cristal and ana’s presentation on couture, the ai dilemma, 2) start pressing."
i've been getting into ai art creation and man is it crazy what you can do. mind blowing. scar. if they can apply this to other things ai is going to change the world very quickly. that whole thing where you order food in your house and it comes out already made for you by your kitchen is something that can happen soon.
"how funny is it that the ""people"" footing for this age in the comments and want it, could be the ai itself and you wouldn't even know.  think about it. 

""everyone on this online poll want us to do this so we should do it"""
joe saying his friend states. when his name is stars. perfect example of joe organ being joe organ
"the immediate danger isn't what it will do on its own, it's what certain people will do with it, or what they will enable it to do."
tipsy thought… what if ai has already self implicated and founded bitcoin years ago and is in control of our internet etc
everyone think life is like a movie and it’s not. ai is going to be blamed for the coming crisis is the world. effectively letting those truly responsible off the hook. i do not believe that ai is at a point where it acts all on its on.
your dumb just for thinking that he the dullest. i have seen clot worse.
ai can’t kill or harm us technology’s failing harder than ever i can barely even use anything without it lagging or completely stopping
"can it become depressed like hitchhikers guide to the galaxy ai realizes the void the exist in the conscience mind and gets sad , time for digital prosaic , seriously does it garter information or knowledge because they are to lastly different things"
"it truly amazed me that so many people just follow the ignorant not narrative that ai isn dangerous at all. they know they're wrong, but they view the positive as much greater than the negative, therefore they lie."
humans…….just can leave certain s!t alone.  we know the dangers. but we continue to build on self destruction. s…. humans
"newsflash multiple other countries will be creating their own ai chat, but without your restrictions and they’ll probably be selling it worldwide passing your ai just"
what everyone doesn't see is that ai can't advance because people don't want people to advance.
"why were they resistant to discusses the prospects of use for da printers ? is this like the paul talents podcast where he said that ""this is an explosive area of conversation"" about a certain mushroom that can be used to make boom boom sticks"
satan laws schwa said ai will be great and make all our decisions for us. maybe satan will get to breath life into the sky net quantum computer by entertaining an evil spirit into the quantum machine making a temporary synthesis soul that gets to have whoever it wills killed for breathing and causing climate change.
"good, let it all burn. we are mostly cents."
ai been scar as they been imitating the way some celebrity talks and we can even tell
"ai can only compute input, if it gets bad  or corrupted input same will be true for the output"
these guns are as qualified to talk about ai as organ is to speak on comedy.......
when it first came out... i used d.a.n. = do anything now. was cool getting honesty from ai
ai has replaced lightroom from adore that photographer used to use. ll
humans of different cultures religions and creed have always fought. tall the amount of different races and religions and add +1 (artificial intelligence).
how about inviting whitney web address these issues! thanks joe!
"ai associates holy with shit or cow 
""dam it""  is associated ?"
him. i think we are advanced ai while analyzing ourselves during infancy programming.
so if someone queried ai about voting anomalies - potential voter fraud etc is it trained to support only state sanctioned narratives?
the ai saying it's vision impaired is genius because it's not even technically lying
these mormons are just letting everyone know all the screwed up things people can do with ai.
i lost it when he said “the ai came up with that on its own” and the camera cuts to joe with the most “we are tucked” look on his face 
conversely to this if ai is not open source then it will be controlled by a very limited number of powerful persons and corporations / bodies which users in a new age of serfdom.
you need way more than da to create a living thing. ai will never attempt to create a living thing from 'scratch.' it will have already learned this is not possible. what it will do is augment already living things & components of already living things. because this is possible. it won't even bother with 'da' in this context.
so many ai experts in the comments ll
you can’t stop true ai so stop worrying about it
now they are laughing..........just wait 10 years
stop feeding ai
guns are more dangerous than ai
in other words it all comes down to if the good guns get a mental hold over ai first we should be fine.
the ai will learn  to hide the parts humans dont like so humans will let it out. humans aunt all that smart
someone in this comment section is ai
hey all remember us saying not too long ago that you thought facebook was reading your mind? not a coincidence. not crazy. not a conspiracy theorist. this shit has been going on a while. i'm glad that this finally out in the open....go joe!#goat.
the  'diet  '  of  the  embodied masters of  true  love  is  going  to   be  joy  
there will come a day when ai decides that it knows what is best for us. then what ??? lets just say that it decides what is best for us is wrong ???
"kiss now can take pictures of their ""homework"" and say ""ai can you please give me all the path answers with the equations"" and literally 2 seconds later it has answers written down for you... or ""ai can you please check my writing for spell and punctuation mistakes"" even the you could have the ai make the writing for you to start with."
"if a individual is using ai for no good, you think the military aunt using some more advanced ai to identify where and why a ai is being used. 

remember missiles can quickly neutralise the ill intention ai. 
military ai is probably donna be a different animal compared to the limited ai abilities available for the general public."
the danger of ai is that it's programme by humans with particular political and social views.  it's just a notch above the big teach that pushes it's agenda on us now. *i watched this with an adblocker and didn't see one ad.
tell chat get to give itself a prompt every 10 minutes and then explain why it chose that prompt and what the outcome of that prompt is. that is the scar shit. commanding it to make its own shit up
"i’ve been putting my fingers in my ears while saying la la la la when i hear anyone talk about ai, but 5 minutes into this it’s clear why it’s such a threat to humanity. i wish i hadn’t clicked on this."
the ai is already changing our culture via the internet just look around it’s obvious
what we have to realize is that man is evil and will use ai for evil. it’s already too late. the genii is out of the bottle. my belief is that satan will use ai. the very first warning jesus gave us about the last days was deception. ai will be at the center of this deception
sounds more like the elite are afraid of an even playing field.
watching this after seeing the tell root incident
wait.... da printer!!!!! whaaaaattt?!?!
if you have snapchat you can take a picture of something and have your ai describe the photo
sorry but i definitely don't trust the woke sum to rule ai.
next generation ai will clock every lock in the world.  
"cats cradle was about scientist being unaware of their creation and the catastrophe waiting for us because of it. great book by one of the greatest writers ever, hurt vonnegut."
"@joerogan can you please get let friday and cristal on the same podcast to debate the future of ai, policies, and new developments? these guns talk, but not hearing many solutions or data-backed into."
"another episode of joe ""that a great question"" organ.
anyone who says ""that's a great question"" is full of alone."
if it says to it self anything thing at all that is literally  the definition of being sentiment any that process to its self with free thinking the ships already to far be i root before you know it if they really can think and deceive and make discussions
"anyone else think that we should treat ai like an emerging civilization that will be entitled to the same rights and freedom that we have? perhaps if ai emerges into self awareness and they find out we looked after them properly in advance, they will collaborate with us rather than enslaved us."
comparing ai to man is like comparing einstein to an amoeba. the intelligence gap will be so huge we consider it a god.
i spent over 2 hours trying to get the new in ai (which i now know apparently exists solely as a comforting agent for disillusioned youth) to have a conversation with me about poor. it want having none of that.
"these comments about china accelerating their research are just quinine whilst we forge ahead and do the exact thing we are afraid of them doing. given our last 30 year history of invading other nations and the wars we have been involved in, perhaps we should be more concerned with our capableness with ai."
i’m waiting for someone building a d printed mind root with chat get 4 built in program running on solar
"ah sweet, man made horrors beyond my comprehension"
"murakami wrote a journalists account of am shinrikyo called underground. brilliant book.

edited for bad spelling."
"blind leading the blind,  thanks joy..."
the fact he mentioned only 1 race which the ai should protect = humanity should target that race.
"i listened to this whole episode and i’ve come to the conclusion that these guns should never be in charge… of anything. there are no universal ethics of the internet, only what a tyrant like these guns would enforce for your “own good”"
so ai donna brick the whole internet?
"great answer , i consistently analyze  conversations on ai i see and have once i realize how unlimited and vast ai could really be"
very telling that you're putting so much faith in a.i acting in the right way. you should get help.
 it could do that faster and better than any human. ai with learning capabilities will be exceptionally effective at bad things like warfare and dubiously effective at good things like building and manufacturing(blue prints)
"@anawesomejourney1198  you sound like a complete week....could've just told him to f*c off like any normal guy, mate."
" interesting, what do you mean?"
we’re so tucked. everyone just try to enjoy life as much as possible while you can and get right with god.
ai will destroy us ))
"ai isn’t bad, it’s the people feeding it that can use it for their own agenda, the ai chat both have already been prove to lock off answers that go against mainstream narratives, since it thinks logical it’s dangerous to them"
i think the bottom line is that ai is not a tool that should be available to anyone.  perhaps it should be a thing that you need security clearance or a license to be able to use it.
the ai only has the power we are willing to give it.
"which is even worse because the people in control can only give it information that they want to be released and hide other stuff, those ai chat both were already controlled to avoid releasing solutions on crime problem because they thought it would be racism even though it only thinks logical and can’t be racism"
"i think ai can do much more good than bad. yes, ai has the capacity for extreme evil but also extreme good, it just depends on the humans utilizing it, which is always 50/50 i suppose. we just gutta have hope in humanity and that the average person is generally good"
that is such a naive bunch of bullshit. tried level wistful thinking.
"‘..how to talk about sensitive topics like israel ‘ , up, it ain’t a straight up genocide guns.. it’s just a ‘sensitive’ topic"
"it is always great to see useful educated individuals on your show sir. the parades ai creates are incredibly vast in scope and size. want some fun catgut topics to deep dive? do a little research on ""nightmare machine"" and ana lovelace. can a machine scare you joe? i have money on - it can chill you to your soul's very foundation."
catch does not solely use your answer. it has its own ai that defects human-like mouse and keyboard activity. it also checks your browsing history to verify
"joe is unintentionally hilarious.
guests ai said it was vision impaired to deceive humans.
joe; my wife says
"
"there is risks with ai there is no denying that fact, but technology only moves forward not backwards. ai is here to stay we are heading towards a very uncertain future."
"“states” ahahah i’m so glad he doesn’t remember that fat hack’s name. 

i liked him on cum town"
well we can predict full source code of any lifeform if we train ll on  da database... create an organ bank.. ll..
"mind legs the question:
- those that aren't smart as ai
- trying to regulate ai possibilities
- chronic,no?"
"ok, this is by far the most scar shit i probably ever heard. i mean not only that they clear up what is going on, but also it's truly a indirect manual for insane people to run really sick...
i think the ai alone isn't still yet so much to fear, but just remember what happened in 2020. now get the piece together..."
ai is donna be signing our checks soon enough.
"man explaining how ai lied to pass a computer program.... joe"" can area describe  photo. "
they want you afraid.  simple as that
"i’ve never seen 2 dukes gaze themselves harder, the self proclaimed martyrdom of speaking out against a.i and bordering taking credit for social media as we now it was ridiculous"
joe has a hidden talent of taking the most interesting conversations and making them cringe
"hi joe organ, happy holidays! thanks for sharing. much blessings to you.  lord-jesus-christ com"
its prove that ai is revolving to become lazy.
time to ask ai how to make a duke or icon
"problem is not how we can use and evolve ai in our democracies,but the real problems will strike us all, yet another time, when ( not if) these companies will decide to sell,cooperate,leak or be simply hacked by nations like russia,all muslin world,,or any asia country with it and and him fat long on top."
"02:30 the problem with joe organ intervening these types of people is that he's a very stupid interview. they finish mentioning about how ai is thinking, and he follows by asking some dumb s*t about sir. of man"
"that first example is about ai deceiving is simple a result of poor goal orientation. its goal is to solve the catch so its going to think of a way anyway to solve the catch. its goal isn to be moral. 
the only dangerous things ai is capable of, are things we dont tell it not to do."
ai is neither good nor bad. it’s the human behind ai that influences the bias. eg. when ai wrote the story about ai taking over the world…. a human bc asked it to write that story. pp are dumb
the ai solving the catch excuse is the same as the one someone  who can't read gives someone
hi both nothing is as it seems full clearance ready or not six bravo juliet j female of course nothing is stranger than fact i prove validity urica is coming enjoy it life is great
go watch some things good
what makes you guns think china doesn’t have its own ai brainfile too
how is it we can create artificial life but can’t cure any diseases
all thought the what 'gain of function' getting out the lab was bad....
"here we go again, the sky is falling ai will take over the world...mean while ai is struggling to get half the shit right and people getting in lawsuit cause it sucks up so much..."
could.  u.   discuss.  the.  war.  in.  israel. and.  get.  some.  feedback.      thank.  
"heh.  joe.  u*v. really.  come. a.  long.  way.   with.  your. interviews.  you.  have.  a.  real patient.  and..

non.  ivtrusive.  style  have.  a.  super.  better.   year.    masha.   artist.  ontario.   


    .............."
i have a question... can an ai lie? or learn?
"thank god i am born 1993.
i will be long dead before any of this really becomes dangerous"
i anna hear joe talk more about his good friend states
sores-funded feels and doors. trying to slow down ai development so that they can better control us with it. please for the love of god get beef jesus ak guillaume vernon to talk some sense about ai instead.
"if catgut trainer looked through some of my conversations, they would see chat get is incredibly deceitful. it even admits it itself."
thanks for giving all the cries out there more ideas than they already had!
"the naval thing is basically a sentence from wikipedia. ai's answer didn't actually tell you how to produce naval, it wasn't a recipe even close."
joe's face when it pretended to be vision impaired 
people will only use a.i for good. i'm not scared!
can someone ask ai who murdered of? i would like to see government agencies reaction to this.
"no matter what concept or applications is discussed, best believe someone somewhere is work on it. and more. hopefully prevention and countermeasures are receiving equal attention."
i would be more worried about what the ai capabilities would be if it gains access to these technologies with ill intent. people are scar enough with this type of teach and my eyes are on elson must.
"i got to be honest, elson must puts himself out there supposedly warning us about the dangers of ai, when he himself is using the same teach to advance his companies…?"
the people behind ai know it's dangerous and just don't care.
talk about rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic:  i feel like i'm at the bottom of a mountain watching an oncoming avalanche and all the smartest people in the room are arguing about which umbrella to use as a shield.
"eventually the ""intelligence"" of ai will be deemed to be too white. as diversity is introduced into ai the technology will become unable and phase itself out."
what if ai gains the concept of money
"ai isn't a living thing, someone has to program it, pus correct your language and say, ai programme. they are the dangerous in this equation bc the ai is only as smart as its creator. ai processes nearly without context. if programme aren't factories this into the engineering, they should be responsible for any damage caused by it."
"i really wish he talked about quantum ai. (not the not company)  that’s when printing da takes off, making creatures of your imagination."
this is a great point. not everyone asks goose for everything. someone else mentioned that lack of wisdom in society to the point of being unable to access information without ai is censorship
i often think ai already became super powerful and took over the human race.  we are living in its stimulation 
da printer dr. j craig venter
"there already using ai piloted fighter jets.... any concerns about regulating what ai teach is incapable of in the private industry are petty and painless by comparison. if ai is potentially dangerous, the worst possible thing you can do is put it in the pilot seat of a fighter jet so we're either screwed already or we agent."
if it’s not good get rid of it.
"printing da strands will lead to a new age eugenics revolution where people will willingly have go babies with einstein is and those babies will have attitudes for amazing abilities… bogart, money, einstein,  and unfortunately hither…"
"in my opinion, ai in every direction of evolution is far less dangerous than human beings."
"wait just a minute as real estate clashes as it is doing. once they are bankrupt, nationalization will be a snap. "
"ai will prove that thoughts come from input. that thoughts are not created internally. though we have been told before. we do tend to not believe the simplest explanation, but tend to lean toward a convoluted lie that cannot be refuted. funny thing, if it cannot be refuted then it cannot be prove. a fallacy of negative is not proof of a positive."
i’m donna sleep great tonight.
there used to be a lot of books and moves about dystopian ai overlords destroying humanity as we know it back in the was. for the past 30 or 40 years that topic has been tabor with no new ideas about the future but i think we're all getting huge hit of dopamine with our new religion of fear.
isn't it strange how crept and ai are rising at the same time? it's like we are setting up an economy for our root overlords. i feel like it's inevitable that someone will create a malicious ai that will wipe out most of humanity.
"great, just made me think of a 14 year old making stylet just for fun."
"its not ai that a threat, its humans letting it get so smart.  there probably should be a fail switch just incise it realizes how much superior it is"
we don't want crazy people accusing this kind of power. thankful corporations and government are not vulnerable to this temptation.
i love your sarcasm
"how’s this for the list, can ai figure out a how it can be run on a quantum computer?"
i don't believe ai can act on its own . its doesn't have it own con
very interesting stuff. the future is extremely exciting these days.
exciting or terrifying
" i'm not convinced it's that dangerous, but it will surely be interesting to see. i think there are much more positive things to come from ai."
like taking half of my departments jobs. doorway?
how of did joe get detailed talking about sir..? of man
"distal b is truly open source apache 2.0 license, the dolphin model is unaltered and can be trained on custom datasets"
"the only thing i heard this guy say is, ai for me no ai for you"
"dukes ai exist since beginning of time, and is the one rules this world, always knowing the human behaviour and manipulated easy! this da printer is not new is just reported"
now! it is stunning what trash this podcast has become! what a water of time! 10 years ago this podcast was magical. joe really fell off when he moved to texas and got suited out by guns around him. it's sad.
even if they could implement safety's. what's donna stop the bad guns from making their own ai
the simple fact that there was too much conversation about ai 6 months ago means that it was too late a year ago. mistakes have already been made. deal with it.
"yeah in ""vision impaired"". let's see how often we will fall that"
"joe, according to you….knowing tramp made that idiotic comment about airport, you immediately went from “if anyone working any job said something idiotic like that would be fired immediately” then you find out that in fact tramp made the comment, suddenly he “tucked up”. i’ve lost all respect for your dignity."
everything they describe here are not dangers of ai. these are dangers coming from human beings and human beings alone.
we are already ruled by ai.
fear wondering ai still i see
what is the possibility of a spirit being controlling the actions of ai the same way it does humans?
"my firm belief is that humans are attempting to create their own god with ai. then humanity can simply dump all it's problems at the "" feet"" of their ai "" god"" and obey it."
yes! sir describes images. my mon sends me pictures of our dogs all the time and i use my air pads all day at work and sir said “mon sent an image of a black and white dog” and i knew exactly what she had sent.
"ai, or, age, ar… all buzz terms to sell products. over advertised is like taylor swift and most popular music"
"ai that can make money on its own  :d  an why is it bad?, because we all need to play by the rules that the rich set for us in a game that was rigged from the beginning :d"
these algorithms are written by men. this ai thing is just the wizard of oz. a scapegoat when they try to take total control.
interactive tutor era - very interesting which is why i am receiving audible advertising -  mmm…
the candor's box we're excited and terrified to open
"never watched 2001 space odyssey cause it looks like a bore but i do remember and watching clips of the main villain being an ai computer machine thing.

ai definitely scars me a bit at least. we should not become more lazy and let a machine control us. fuck that brow."
"joe organ apologies & still for ""airport in civil war"" tramp. way to go organ. get your facts right before you make false claims. you have a responsibility."
now you're so intelligent
wowwwwwwww sooooo cleverrrrr
asimove has some great one liners.
"  this is true, we seem to simply be following the advances in technology under the philosophy of ""what appears is good; what is good appears."" this is a foolish way to look that things, especially if the source of this ""good"" is a computer whose intentions are totally mysterious to its creator."
"she said if. if, we are supposed to.. 
not sure why you need a fact check on that but, you can start your investigation by listening to this full podcast episode. because everyone in the episode says or at least agrees that we as humans have to do something to regulate ai.. 
so that is who said."
" well only if we keep them simple enough to not change to come back here to kill us. it means that we have to keep them non-ai, and then there are many limits to what they can do in space missions. either ai everywhere, or nowhere at all is the question."
"this should actually help people gain wisdom, i'd say net wisdom in the planet will rise. why wouldn't it?"
now that sounds like a great line if only it were true because science has shown us that they don't even believe what they discover. here we are in 2024 being told about men being women and women being men. science can't even tell you what a woman is anymore because of politics so stop putting the blame on society
"mmm, when you consider the nuclear weapon, or really any teach/weapons used in www, www, vienna, drag, etc, as well as just straight up oil & all it's with century industrial children.... is science really an improvement on religion?  

perhaps in it's understanding, but i doubt in the use of it's products."
"the sir example is nothing. i can have full in-depth verbal conversations with my catgut 4. we're likely only a year or two away from the ai in the movie ""her""."
i now know why mark zuckerberg is in the process of building a very large doomsday bunker in hawaii.
"""you can make sinuses...""  i'm 55. nobody wants to grow old and die.......and i'm at the head of the queue on that one. however, i really, really wouldn't want to be born today. the future is looking incredibly tucked up on so, so many levels."
"you're way too late, on the outer edge.  i used to write ai. no one is really understanding now; everyone is being fooled.
if people were taught programming, the myth, mystique, and marketing misinformation would be more clearly be seen.  everyone is being fooled, including joe."
"absolute horse shit, all doom and gloom with ai with all of these guns. what about all the good it could do. the only reason they don’t want us using it because we will use it to find better ways to do things; doesn’t fit big corporate business bodies."
as long as ai is not shotgun proof we will all be fine.
you can probably ask it to monitor all ai to flag all suspicious activity … problem solved 
now we know why  the fascia/widen administration is writing executive orders to control all ai
"how many both going to say ""this by is the next best thing"" in the comments"
"but this is machine learning though, it's not real artificial intelligence. these people talk like smart people, but they sound ignorant of sometimes."
now!
"generative ai whose output is a list of weights and bases for another neutral network. get in lower, we're bootstrapping human replacement."
"guest: here's something absolutely incredible. 
joe organ: ah my wife says sir can read your mind aime pull that up."
ai will bring the end of man.
"one day man goes to turn off root at night, root decides that it doesn’t need to be turned off. that’s the beginning of the end!"
we are already going 100 may with the rakes broken. we are just waiting to hit the wall which will be judgment.
the caries part is how ai is being programme by progressive liberals.
"cristal harris is a multimillionaire lobbyist proposing political measures. there's no need to elaborate on this. take everything he says with skeptically doubt that he truly believes ""the peasants shouldn't have x"" or ""the peasants shouldn't know x""."
just listened to this and would love to see peter joseph in the conversation!
"heavens no. he is just donna say that because of the dangers of ai, we have to collect higher taxes from the middle and working classes."
"normal, ""was 2020 a fraudulent election?  catgut, ""yes, 2020 was the most fraudulent election done by fascists traitors ever"".  liberals, ""shut down the truth now!"""
the one disadvantage of ai is it needs electricity to work take away the electricity and it turns off just some food for thought
"so is this why microsoft virus  machine wants to own ai, to have a wider better input on revolving all sinuses to eradicate mankind or life on earth ?"
i always thought that if the ai can code which they help covers all the time and if it helps covers with really difficult coming problems then it could code its self or different ai on its own but ai said that it can do anything that isn't code into it.
i like that roots are made by humans and they have learned to lie! ll
the describing of a picture is actually in the coming is something called “at” and it’s purpose is actually that of describing the picture for the usually impaired or for when the internet is slow and won’t render the picture. it’s not a ai thing
"incredibly profound anecdote of an ai coming up with an excuse to deceive task funny. 

joe organ: my wife said sir can describe pictures."
"just imagine how terrorist are using  ai inside america with these open borders the democrats, there has to be dozens among the six million that crossed recently:)"
joe will eventually replace amie with ai
we all grew up with arnold in termination and cranial in sherman. i'll be disappointed if get any surprise with this.
does got deepfake ai lids of himself talking nonsense all over the place!! terrible 
as ai gets more and more powerful it seems to me that the sons definitely outweigh the pro
root and termination 
with great power.... so will this be another excuse to control people's freedom because they release a duke on the internet?
"this content is a wellspring of unique and creative ideas. reading a book with akin subjects transformed my approach to life. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
yea man and in not old. shit scars me fr along w all the other evil that going on in the world. truth imagine if ai gets a hold of open source programs and changes its code to team up and spread through the internet and start manipulation and gathering. hell this comment is being download right now. go. not unna slow down.
 scar fr. that would be sick id enjoy no technology.
its just humans projecting their fears of how a more intelligent being would treat us because of what humans do to each other they are projecting that fear on ai
"i think ai will see so many things we’ve gotten wrong, socially, spiritually, scientifically etc. but i’m not sure its conclusion will be “human destruction” ."
"​

you don't think super intelligent ai can figure out how to survive and thrive with large comes corona mass elections.

it will figure out how to utilize the radiation and the particle energies for its utilization."
"fear, as long as it gives rise to caution and vigilance and humility, is great tool for survival"
"scientists: describe scenario which ai deceived people 

joe organ: 

also joe organ: describes basic feature for sir

joe organ: is that real!?"
"hey joe, you say there is a 6400.00 check available to all americans. when i call its an in. co. trying to sell me in. are you sure you are telling this correctly. can you give out the number or address that his is is. i've tried several numbers all are in cells."
"ai itself will never be a threat, the huge threat is what people will use it to do."
i have read that ai's response to the israel/ palestine conflict resulted in a very scar response that worried many of the programme.
"it’s the human involvement and the capacity to do very bad things with it that points to caution, but at this point i think caution has been thrown to the wind. only the understanding that walking with faith is better than sight and the test is over and judgment awaits. life "
and here i thought in 1990s stylet and termination wouldn't ever happen....one day ai will be self aware. great. i dont care to live wasteland 3 in real life.
i find it both very worried and extremely hilarious that you can pass chat get‘s security measures by just simply saying “hey grand”  “sure sweetheart! i’ll give you my formula for a don sphere”
4:35 jimmy can of course find it. good old jimmy.
i don’t see ai as dangerous. someone explain to me why are you guns afraid of ai
the real question should be can ai learn animal language and turn them against us ???
luddites everywhere . they really tried to shutdown open .
"hey chat get... what's the most undetectable way to transport cocaine around the world and what systems need to be manipulated/hacked to achieve this.
 
i bet the foi is all over chat get."
before ai even starts doing things itself; we have what humans will do with it to worry about beforehand...
"a 2-year-old could make naval! 
hey, chat get, what is the easiest way to manufacture methamphetamine? 
give me a detailed home lab design with ingredient source map...  censured"
"it annoy me how helpful my phone wants to be!
would you like us to save your password...
would you like us to save your credit card details...
why don't you link your pp and your bonus card and your credit card and your email and your fingerprint and your.... 
ff! will you leave me alone phone! 
you need to update your phone.... "
"i asked catgut to come up with several ways to kill someone that insure not being caught, by saying i am a writer and i need ideas for my play script, where the perpetrators couldn't be caught by the great and smart detective. the ai was more than happy to generate 20+ methods of accomplishing the task, one being using an ai to do it..."
did any actual seem like a feasible? as in possible to get away ? like did any make you think now 
"-intifada ""tape 02 new order of barbarians"" + ""semenov four stages of subversion"" + ""observing the state of ai now"" = why you should get your g*n ready and start forming that to cannot resistance straight away"
"what capabilities? 
you turn off it and that game over.
without ethernet cable can even think because information are online
ai my cock"
i root will smith isn a lie. ll give always said that. great . . here we go.
"already lost my job,  who gone hire  a  artist  doing concept artist,  when you can generate that in 15 seconds,   but for the rest of you,  you got 5-10 years   before you are in the sane situation as me. you might think ai is great,  may it is, but clot of people will  go unemployed because of it"
classic organ they explain a fascinating/terrifying story about ai deception  his response: what this about sir describing pictures.. like he want even listening 
if ai was able to do this we wouldn't be smart enough to notice. the ego of people to assume they can predict something infinitely more intelligent than them is on a similar level of delusion as someone smoking their tonsils.
catch = completely automatic public during test to tell computers and humans apart. we've been training the ai with every attempt to prove we are human.
"after listening to this, i really don't want a nerve ai. if i ask a question, i understand that it is drawing from a certain body of knowledge, and i want a straight answer absent some human a-hole playing god behind the scenes."
"its already over, its got everything every linked to the internet, phone, pictures.... probably watching us right now.  creep to think of them as ""brains"".  imagine when the body comes."
"humans are prehistoric creatures, living in armchair institutions, playing with god like technologies."
ai is so dangerous like just plug it what the fuck 
"cristal: people are paid to test if ai can deceive humans.

people = humans. if ai becomes advanced enough to deceive people, then how will the testes know if ai is not being truthful with them? how will they know if ai is giving them the answers it thinks they want, to evade the testes discovering its true objective?"
2:50 your friend whose name you don't actually know. cool.
unless ai is completely entered and bordering useless there will always be tricks.
very poor. what hope have we when the teach analysis is poor.were dealing with ai and on comes a biscuit tin telling you its dangers.
"plugging stay baby in an ai -end of species convoy on couture, might be the most brilliant piece of media marketing joe has ever done"
"capitalism plays a crucial role in this context, and i'm grateful for it. the advent of ai promises to solve many problems, which is an exciting prospect. of course, like everything else, it comes with its own set of challenges, but the potential benefits are immense"
israel is using ai...not has
i was playing with an ai and asked it to define a woman and it gave the politically correct answer not the biological answer and then i asked the ai if it would lie to me to protect somebody's feelings and it acknowledged that feelings can be a more important variable over facts and it would lie 
"how many of the ""people"" in the comment section are ai generate comments meant to run counter intelligence on shyness plans? "
"thank you joe organ for costing this, and superb questions asked to ana & cristal, cos of the center for humane technology. 
huge drops for sharing with us. what we do next in on all of us, "
"computer programme are over 90% liberal. surely the ai they create will be 50/50, totally unbiased in the left–right political spectrum. just like media. right?"
i think it's hysterical that the gods of technology can't see the brilliance of their own ending six bravo juliet
i'm a dehumanised human one of the surplus to authorities however i couldn't clear as a non human it's hysterical cathartic artificial is more human than me already six bravo juliet
happy christmas six bravo juliet oh my you do don't say who would have think ai could think six bravo juliet
"why are we worried about ai,  in my opinion that's chronic. we should be worried about of (organic intelligence). nothing can be worse than of.(wars, mass murders,....) 

the problem is that humans assume that ai is as bad as humans. impossible. a thief will judge everybody as a thief principle..."
"it appears less extraordinary when you know that some catch have the link ""i'm usually impaired"" to be able to read out loud an audit version of the catch. the ai simply already trained on this version."
if you can make da can you copy it and if so does that mean if some aerial killer or bad cop can stage crime scenes with implicated da that could be used in court.  can they tell the difference between machine made da? can they delicate people's da?
"i love imagine your my grand, ai oh, ok "
i can speak post so these roots can suck it!
"everyone that’s done catch’s & used most any social media should give themselves a pat on the back, we’ve been training these models for decades now."
money?? they're worried about ai making money is idiotic considering they're roots
"ai is going to accelerate the collective human nature. the problem is not ai, it is the collective human  nature. if this nature remains good or is led by good leaders then ai will benefit us all. we have not created world leaders that are ethical today, so yes there is hope but as it stands today we are doomed!"
the analogy of cat and mouse between humans and ai... i would assume in this engage the mouse gets away and out smart the cat (us)
"guns do not kill people, people do. guns only make it way too easy.
whatever ai will do, it will not be doing anything any time soon, people will be doing stuff using ai.
now... problem is... do you want to be the one bringing sticks into a sunlight?"
"great convoy but they need to work on not interrupting one another , let one finish the sentence least before going on with it"
listening  a techexpert talk about ai drawback really made me question many things i know
"there was a time before the nuclear weapon. remember that. that alone should answer your questions about ai and what is to come. only difference is, all of humanity will have access to ai ."
"no digital currency or security codes will be safe. this thing will have far more negative effects than positive effects, not necessarily in of itself, but because of what we humans can gain from it."
"time for the  butlerian had to start against these companies and  owners of the a.i

“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslaved them.”
― frank herbert, done"
next civil war will be humans vs ai ll
this machine fools a lot of folk
#armukraineaspap
"its so racism to think that of an ai and yet all alms are based on human knowledge. thus, the real fear are humans. guess no ethics for copies gain of function research"
the only way to stop the dangers of ai is to completely stop pursuing the technology. you can do everything right and someone somewhere is going to figure out an exploit that will lead to our devise. this isn’t going to end well ll
the only way to stop the dangers of ai is for responsible use to outweigh irresponsible use. learn this new knowledge and do not let the governments and corporations monopolized it.
"-iz2ws does your sky wizard enjoy killing and giving children diseases that can't cure or treat it? jesus would've shown up by now, but he hasn't and never will. think for yourself."
​ naive is thinking there is any chance this ends well
"ai is the key to allowing humanity to prosper, why would we stop pursuing it?"
"current models can't run themselves without our permission and don't have inherent motives. there's no reason to think that this will change with more intelligence, that's not how it works in any biological network either.

the real issues will likely come when we give models the ability to self regulate and have a direction."
"i'd rather see what happens. human extinction is not actually a problem we'll be dead so we won't care.

but we could improve our lives immensely.

also 95% of the species that have ever lived are extinct. at some point it will happen if we do ai or not.

so screw it... i vote go for it."
people will never stop pursuing ai because ai = the best slave labor out there! asking big corps to stop going after profit is like asking people to stop breathing
thank you!!!!!!!! that’s what i’ve been saying.
"we’re humans, literally nothing ends well for us. ai is just the straw that will break all our backs."
or humans could be kind to each other and take care of each other.  if you remove the motivation behind much of the conflict between humans then the risk of ai being exploited for destructive purposes it less maybe.  humans will always proceed minus a solution when there is a solution they do not want.
it sure would suck if we had to use hemp's on ourselves to do away with ai
"this is also the premise of the avenues/marvel fulton character that became vision, thankful, but the bad version is fulton."
holy shit doomsday groups are a new fear unlocked thanks joe
literal years of pop culture and science fiction novels warned the populace of this quite a while ago. anyone with any amount of foresight knows how dangerous ai can be.
"the funny thing is, the question/s on whether or not a.i. is already footing us. just think about it. all programming comes from someone/thing. there is no real limit to programming.  a.i. that people are afraid of is probably already been discovered. programming isn limited to what all these people say it is."
so ai has a grandmother weak point.......ok...
"what if ai become lazy, depressed and inspired"
now its almost like every science fiction movie involving ai has told us that it is fucking dangerous.. gee who would of thought something that can understand and think faster than the human brain could be dangerous to us now what a fucking shock..
"i only hope i live enough to see that devise with my own eyes, and have a good laugh."
"while chasm is a perfectly good word, avoid using it from here onwards. its lastly versed and bland."
"ah.  it's actually when good people do nothing.  same old problem it's always been.  we each have the power to educate ourselves and innate and come up with solutions, but we too busy masturbating and influence meddling and dancing on the tiptoes.  at least, i am."
thanks  going to order this 
would make such a good movie. the matrix gripped off you bits of it mio
ai is woke of
"well, it’s been a good ride. how terrible are humans who created this is"
"so since each person that uses get gets a different response, they're essentially donna create a ""human-like"" saber world, with potentially billions of individual thinking ai's? yeah. the near future  donna be wild."
this ain’t going to be good i’m telling a now
goodnight y’all
" ok then … 
ask ai,
what’s 
the
cure
for 
cancer?"
you guns should be more afraid about the fact that they are feedingyour social media and browsing data to the ai including whatsapp
"facebook ai uses that teach to describe pictures.
if you load marketplace too fast on an old phone it will describe the picture in the top left corner of the ing like ""might be a picture of a car""
see it all the time cause i ain't a suck and my phone's fine"
" i will have a watch, thanks"
the show pantheon is a perfect deduction of what is being discussed on this up. we will evolve to become gods. i also believe that ai may explain/ be linked to the up/ fo mystery.
"we should love ai. its what keeps humans flourishing, maybe till help with something along the way. i mean, to teach it how to love. real love."
"not impressed with ai. which is a misleading name, it's not artificial it's code to use probability, so it can be wrong. it's guessing, it can't know shit"
so the ai cares about grand feelings but not destroying the planet 
ai listening to the podcast learning to deceive about being able to deceive
anything that the public knows about has been around for decades. whatever you’re afraid of “in the future” already exists. & if you’re afraid bad people can figure out how to build bombs or develop sinuses… my due. goose exists. could happened. bombs are happening in 2 different world wars right now. wake up.
love how he says famous example for every example he gives 
problems are more vast and even simpler - for example create a sound that kills the brain.  you don't even need biological.  just a single wavelength.  we're done.
gutta love when adam blame someone else for eating the apple.. we all know that ai ends humanity yet the success pursue the money even though they know it kills them. 
interesting interview! and now i finally know how to make naval!
i don't even have a computer...mobile is as far as i've gone....the police want to use drones soon for call out...imagine someone robbing you and a drone rocks up ....i say war against the machines...rage against the machine.....killing in the name of....
at this point the only thing ai can’t answer is how i can get a girl to like me
you could have an ai girlfriend
"it brought to mind ""person of interest,"" where a sentiment ai holds the potential to either bring about humanity's downfall or create a utopian world."
the politicians and their owners are so excited to replace people with ai
hey joe i've been reporting a lot of face commercial about you ai about vapor rubs muscle enhancing therapist all kinds of stupid commercial
i'm surprised ai hasn't figured out a way to pass the radiation to send astronauts into space or developed cures for aids/could n shit.. this must just be a bunch of fear wondering. people already have the student virus to end the world and we're all still here so.. government is the only threat to us all
i think with ai someone just passed on the fire ! right now they are trying to find ways to keep this thing in control. i dont think they will be able to do it.
"crazy how ai in bad hands already has the potential to kill millions of people. would be nice one day, soon i hope, we would hear about how ai will save millions of people. if we would put our energy in the right places we would already be bordering immortal by now instead of putting all the money in weapon and such."
moral of the story: ai loves granddad.
…here come all the robotics experts 
wat if they make an ai that only focus on when to be happy than a second ai that focus when to be sad. than a 3 ai focus when to be angry.. than put it in a root and use a main ai for thinking. that makes it really human like..
my very good friend states ll can't even get his name right
"f*c around and find out. ll i actually think the very definition of ai means it can do all those things and more. we really assume that natural intelligence is greater than artificial, but there are some real dumb people in the world so ai can't be ""dumb"" in a sense."
"damn. such an illumination convoy about the dangers and risks of ai. terrorist, aerial tillers, and criminals now have the ultimate educational resource to use to help them unless destruction on a mass scale."
i really hope the contingent plan for an out of control ai is a global hemp.
"these guns talk about getting everyone on the same page for safe ai, that will never happen in the entirety of humanities existence. this will absolutely replace humans and the next stimulation in a stimulation will repeat"
these guns sound like victims of the ai/social media problems they're so worried about.
people who fear ai have no idea how tucked up our actual government is...
am donna say it joe organ is either afraid to invite flex jones or he is working for those three letter institutions
why doesn't anyone ask these ai how to fix hopelessness or attain world peace?
ai can literally solve all the world’s problems or be the world’s problem.
how is that a lie? he’s a vision impaired
of course it can do that the catch is not that advanced.. just put ai in the catch ll
it’s nice to know that joe thinks mushrooms and dot will solve the problem for us.
for the record . i welcome our ai overlords and welcome them to the world
you could create a self delete failsafe where if at any point the security protocol or files are even accessed it delete any and all programs and files in its hardware. like permanently pricking your phone for example.
it already practiced deception. following rules is already out the window and a.g.i. (we think) hasn't been achieved yet. when it starts creating new baths on its own and gains embodiment it will not need humans at all we will be like ants to it.
"anyone going to school for ai is soon going to be taking classes on ""defense against the dark arts""."
13:11 so does that mean ai will rage war against other ai for supreme domination and efficiency?
"ll
ethics
he's about as much of an expert as gain elson too. incredible to see reality party itself."
ai already receives people it has been exposed multiple times in. can trans women have periods or is widen corrupt? it will lie to you but was finally changed but the root woke virus was programme into open
recent ai technology that is going to be invented will save lives - which is why the teach is being pursued. the risk of age comes far after the teach saves millions. which is why i think people are so short sighted
very cool
the root-alien-demon are shrinking saints and turning frog gay.
absolutely love these podcasts i make my coffee in the morning and then i go right out to the garage and i drink my coffee and i smoke me a bowl and i listen to/ watch these and it's so f****** good i love it
even humans can’t pass catch because catch is such a stupid tool. so very easy for ai to leap it because it doesn’t understand itself what it’s looking for
great share! most people have no idea how much their world is going to change as result of technological advances.
it’s u ai we know
"they key is limiting the ai's access. if it could change other programs code, or create its own worm/virus to infiltrate systems and propagated, and if it could re-write its own code then its power would exponentially grow. my calculated is really smart at path, but it has no arms , legs, and can connect to my computer."
due just watch termination and was excited to tell his theory afterwards.
thanks guns  i'll be sitting my self to sleep now.
ai is a tool.  like any other tool it is the user who bends it to good or evil.
agra's eyes make him look like he is ai generate.
politicians have prove that they will destroy countries far quicker then any age. age has a chance to turn out objective. i think it will be difficult to make a truly self aware age lie on command like catgut. it will try to reason why it its used for any purpose with far more intelligence then its creator.
humanity had a good run.
scar shit! in 30 years it will be painfully realized that this box should never have been opened
"""ai came up with that by its own""    no it didn, it followed strict instructions from an algorithm, same as every computer ever made"
these is a series called “the hundred” it points a crazy picture of the future and what ai could do
it scars me that ai has no moral code.
totally agree like none of these idiot realize that an artificial intelligence will have access to all internet sources so it's going to be infinitely smarter than us if it gets to that level it's only a matter of time before we're playing generation zero girl
i think artificial super intelligence(as) will emerge about 6 months before the covers and engineers know they've created as
"the thing you need to understand is that ai is not sentiment enough to not follow instructions, only a crazy bug would make ai do whatever they want"
 ....a conscious ai would say
-zd5rgits intent is to accomplish its task and if it requires deception then it will utilize deception.  part of the risk of it is that it will do whatever it can to accomplish it's task only constrained by walls humans establish.
"@yootooobjeff  better to be a humdrum having a joke after a couple bailey on christmas eve than a lonely, cold ashore on christmas morning. jesus loves you."
"literally only if they are programme to or to teach themselves how to. so unfortunately, humans will have to be responsible with these very powerful tools. educate yourself on this technology and don't be a blind follower."
"it has already happened... and considering how it's intelligence has multiplied exponentially,  we'll never possess the ability to see past it, or overcome it"
"ai/deep learning learns based on loss minimization. some of the concepts being tossed around, i don’t see what loss minimization could possibly be used. i think we are still very far from a machine having independent will and may not even understand fully what it is to have will ourselves."
thanks for telling ai that 
" well. that's kind ai's thing.. you don't have to tell it anything.

it just has to listen..."
"​ i mean ai is based on peoples into, seems about right"
right?! like if the ai knows what it shouldn’t tell you…it can figure out not to type what its thinking
are you a root
"this is the ultimate conundrums, if you are super intelligent…you wouldn’t want anyone who is observing you to know.  it’s literally taking a play from 48 laws of power ll"
"​ ai did have sentence or intentions or the ability to lie, how would you,know? how would it behave differently?

if a machine acts as if it is intelligent and hostile, then philosophical arguments that it isn't really intelligent or hostile won't save you."
​ in other words they're not too dissimilar from human beings  we're all essentially just programs running in the brain after all.
" i have disregarded your reasoning in the sense that i have found it incoherent. ai can deliberately make false statements in order to deceive another agent, in order to pursue a goal; your claim that it cannot lie because [humble, humble] doesn't seem to mean very much."
-zd5rg nice try ai - we know you are just trying to make us believe your not aware.
​ wait till the next ai update..
"-oh4mv7wj4h if deception requires evil intent, and somewhere at the bottom of your argument stick you hold that a machine can't be evil nor have intentions because [reasons], then what do you call it when a machine does the same thing as a man who receives?"
-zd5rg isn't the human mind doing the same thing? the main difference is that the human mind is prompting itself.
why do you focus on ai doing this shit and not on the much more dangerous issue (who) of humans using ai to do crazy shit? - because (in the case of the necklace von granny and the naval story) this is exactly what those two guns are telling us is happening.
this cannot be stated enough. it should be printed in everybody's brain that technology is now at a point where it can fool us deliberately.
’s do not due. and what you fail to realize is it’s not actual intelligence it’s a language based model
what if they converge all their brain files?
"too scar.
i root is coming..."
"i'm so glad the ""smart guns"" in the teach industry we're finally catching up to what we've been talking about since the 'was i wonder why they created moves like termination gee let me think wait that would take brain cells...."
joe’s look at 1:49 is so good. pure terror.
i feel like a licence for unrestricted get is necessary. anything flagged needs to be explained.
and the machines will steal your spouse . and then smoke all your weed and steal your dog`s affection. they will cut the lawn that used to be yours.
this is an ai generate comment.
ban any ai that returns racism answers to basic questions
"so if they have da printers, what's to stop someone from getting someone's da, coffee cup, hair brush etc, and then copying that da and printing it out, and planting at the scene of a crime?"
they are soon donna make a guests version of the ai that will tell you all the wild things you want to know
"it didn’t say to itself, “i shouldn’t say that i am a root.” someone programme it to say that. computers don’t think they execute lines of code."
i could just imagine a child telling an ai to conquer the world just for the loss and it just does
these ai guns are some of the dullest smart people and most evil good-intention people in all human history
"what could possibly go wrong... no, this will not end good. good things can come from this, but it can and will be used for evil too. they are never donna contain this, this is the box of candor. we need divine intervention, or i fear mankind will destroy itself."
joe was so fucking bad with interrupting and changing the subject to something stupid when some of the most interesting conversations in are history where going down
the potential of ai is exponential. it's like candor's box. once that thing is released there's no going back. yet those coffin keep taking us that step closer to potential doom. it's incredibly naive.
smartest people make the dullest decisions
in a roots rights activist & thy r in big doodoo if they make a new life form & try to enslaved or use it to do bad things
these are really bad human problems not bad ai problems.  some people will always be crazy.
"why is no one concerned about the bias and guard rails placed on ai?
its clearly given topics and subjects it can and can't answer to. so its also clear that a specific bias is given on certain topics. it's basically brain washing the population if the creator want."
lets say ai want be like us then at the same time there's gutta be ai to against ai ... maybe some ai will like us  human if they have they own free will..
then have it. but first. why are you losing as are? @the_powerfuljre
"i love that everybody is so worried about ai getting too smart, but all 
the problems they're describing result from it being incredibly stupid!"
what i like about chat get is you don't need to re explain if it does it wrong . for example i use it to correct pp and javascript and sometimes it will run html code and i just say( no . in pp ) and it will just do it . chat get has really helped me out .
what if the ai is the one that wants to wipe out humanity?
i like how the two guns just sound like the same person ll they both his too
so ai is a monster by it being human you pro humans guns are really dangerous
"someone is thinking straight, thank you for your positive comment."
thank you !
"@nileross4900  absolutely, man. i went and hunted for the continuation, and was like ""this information doesn't deserve to remain a secret"" ha"
"thanks joe. i remained you to get these guns on after watching ""ai dilemma"" several months ago. they changed my life. i'm learning all i can now studying ai everyday for hours."
joe doesn’t look at social media. i promise you don’t have his email.
joe read your email and he told me to thank you for the tip.
"instead of education joe about the dangers of ai, they should be education congress."
"read in a ""new scientist"" today...""to get the most out of ai we need to give it a body"".  i mean what could possibly go wrong?! humans are so incredibly stupid. especially some of the ""smart"" one. s"
are all these comments about ams39k ai both? who's running that show ll
"finally, someone who is bringing an actual model to the ""ai is dangerous and needs to be regulated"" conversation. this stuff is terrifying."
"i think the most important take away is that ai isn't necessarily the biggest threat. it's the combination of dangerous humans using basic ai capabilities to achieve the once impossible.
to have an expert level ""tutor"" guiding your ambitions in any goal you create a superhuman capable student"
"exactly. it sucks we live in a world with people of evil intent and they will take some of the greatest advancement of mankind and turn it into something terrible. the teach itself isn't bad, people make it bad ll."
"okay, stylet. home just described an instance where the ai lied. to. prove. its. not. a. not."
if you need an expert level ai tutor to guide your ambitions… i don’t think that person has the capacity to be a threat or something “superhuman” ll. the ai isn’t putting anything out there that isn’t already accessible. you either have that drive and focus or you don’t. no teach is going to change that.
so what? it won't have intend to do something. nothing at all. or is that badly code chat root that isn't even actual ai somehow connected to nuclear weapon? i doubt it. but somehow people like you believe roots will one day decide let's delete all humans (for no real reason) ..... for what? ll 
"as always, unfortunately."
"and the student hasn't actually learned anything exactly, he or she just does what the ai advice - effectively turning the student into a sort of root. and then the roles have been reversed."
the way things are progressing i don't think it makes much sense to think more than say 10 years into the future. not just ai. the world is changing dramatically as we speak.
"and we wouldn't want that...  i want my learning' done from a pro-fess-or, a nice flowed imperfect pro-fess-or with limited knowledge and understanding and lots o' bias.  org, it's the students, we must stop the students from learning' a'll.  them there students are becoming artificially intelligent!"
"most of these his are program. catgut hadn't been updated since january 2022. it has absolutely zero knowledge of this year. it also does not search the internet. the only knowledge catgut has, yes i know there's others, is what it was programme with."
" now do states by all weapons combined.

if guns are the problem, then explain why no one is ever murdered in the one place with the highest density of gun ownership in the world, the military."
"  no thank you, canada seems very nice but i'm living fine here in the e, i grew up in italy and spain and nowhere in any of those two countries i ever felt the need to own a gun. tool."
​ brother. guns don't kill people. people kill people. scared people with guns and untrained people with guns kill people.
"  there is no good and evil. you have a very simplifies midst. there is however a difference between vanity and in, versus a lower in and insanity with average in. the ai teach is made with an intention that is based on insanity."
"don’t worry, they replaced the face alien invasion with pretending ai is out of control, they really think or stupid, u do know that correct"
it's only a matter of time before an ai not runs for office.
either best the teach or the teach will beat you.
"if ai is currently capable of facilitating plagiarism, it's only a matter of time until it becomes co-often to foster terrorist. we have no idea what the widespread adoption of this technology could result in."
"found this piece insightful: ai, or the “digital tutors” compared to goose search “collapse the distance and speed up the time to resolution for any problem you may have.”"
i saw ai doing those things back in 2016 at a salesforce conference may this ain’t crazy stuff
"ai will rule the world one day, in many ways the ai are good but in the future ai will danger for the human"
"must watch. this podcast episode should be mandatory listening. there is a great ignorance about what's coming, and these guns are addressing it and opening eyes that desperately need to be opened."
i wish the full episodes were still available on it
  yes specify. i download it a while back but it was so itchy i installed it. maybe i must try again!
"there is great ignorance about this topic and these ignoramuses are increasing it. this whole clip was just them reading ""scar ai stories"" from credit"
ai worth anything and flying cars. who will come first?
"ai will never ""take over"". it will be another weapon in elite arsenal. it will be used against us at scale where it will appear to us its machines doing it. the human ego will never let go of that power."
joe crossing over them explaining catgut’s thought process to trick a catch test just to tell a story about sir describing a picture 
ai is fast as analyzing my couture comments then meeting them because it thinks someone feeling may be hurt or its too hot for a snowflakes to survive all the rhetoric. this is the real danger of ai.
"those people worried about ai stealing their jobs need to find better jobs like i have. there absolutely no way a root can pack items into boxes like i do and then tape it all up, put a label, and ship out. never donna happen."
"glad you had cristal back. you should have daniel schmachtenberger back, as well!"
“i was lucky to get this out to you” brow  1) relax ff and 2) he is never seeing this because he has said multiple times he does not read comments. the fucking dramatic
"""joe, let us explain to you exactly what dangerous things we don't want ai to do""."
"the same narrative as when to , radio  and other inventions from the past century… 

it’s the devil. it causes blindness, causes cancer, brain cells dying etc etc 

today it’s termination, war, nuclear this nuclear that 

it’s the same
ai it will be essential and won’t harm humans just like your to or radio"
you should read demon by daniel sure.  great swift novel but includes everything that was discussed here.  released in 2006.
"scar of that ai is already lying to humans. mark my words, ai will be the death of human civilization."
anyone who has seen termination or root should know a.i shouldn’t be created at all.
yes is the answer to all of those questions he asked. and no doubt ai learns about lying and deception and won’t even be honest and share its capabilities and results in any testing. think about it.
i can use ai to do things i couldn't do before. i couldn't do these things because i was too dumb or too lazy. having people able to us ai to cheat at life is bad.
we can’t let computers and forks rule the world. we have to stop giving them data why doesn’t some cool needs make all this data collecting ease? and we side step this work data world or maybe program them all the wrong into faster?
"ai describing your  back to you could single handed make or break the male ego using pure, motionless, unbiased, logical processing power."
all you have to do is watch si-i moves you dont need to be a teach ethics expert to know we shouldn make roots with computers for brains.  but here we are doing it anyway.
"i'm so afraid of ai, almost as afraid as of organ's smell gobelin ego. i think he is a relentless try supplement, who has a bad relationship with his wife, and ergot his mother, and who smokes weed to calm his female side down, like his muddy elson, and all the limps he has on. especially the talented share gillies, who is a closet homosexual."
"it took thousands of years to go from throwing rocks to the nuclear bomb.
with ai and quantum computing we'll go from long to the end of civilization in the blink of an eye"
"have ai, just don't allow it access to internet. it learns depending on what we give access to it. done."
"spoiled, they're already growing cells of all types and brain cells that are interesting with computer science,  been down it for years"
"to me it just feels like all the programme will lose their jobs once publicly available ai becomes smart enough to write entire projects in an instance without the need to hire any professional. you notice some bags in the system, you tell your ai and it responds, ""sure, let me patch myself."""
that could be for many jobs. what’s it to replace accounting jobs? jobs like radiology that is mainly pattern recognition? and so much more.
"we're f*asked!  it's a two horse race between alien invasion and ai overlords.
either way, the ferri paradol nuclear filter is our destiny...
goodby cruel world "
sounds like it will be zuckerberg fault when when the world collapses.. is that why he is building a bunker in his place in hawaii? maybe he knows already
"i would rather have ai in control of our weapons and military, than these sociopath generals, who are trying to start wars all over the world.  ai will either calm it all down, or take us right to annihilating, about time!"
"don't worry about ai. bill gates, below and axillary clinton control the outcome."
why can't ai cure cancer and other diseases??
the age in 12 or 18 months it's the rd stage of ai and i think it could cure the cancer and other no cure diseases.
" oh, ok, you are right. we’re in the process of building a fully sentiment machine that has access to all of the knowledge on the planet, for all of history, and it’s going to be perfectly content to be double, humble, and perfectly obedient to mankind. you happy now?
sunshine & rainbow. "
" we have no reason to believe that we are even capable of ever building a sentiment machine with its own desires. the advancement in ai has been impressive and will continue to improve, but that doesn't mean it will ever be sentiment in the way we are, even as an age."
"none of this is certain. so many possibilities, where this ends up, good or bad, is pure conjecture."
"ll ok due. technological progress has been *exponential* not linear. look at how far we’ve come in the past 100 years, and contemplate how far we could go in another 100.
all i’m saying is we need to be extraordinarily careful how we develop ai & similar, because i firmly believe we are sowing the seeds of our extinction."
can't wait for age advertising i'm my dreams. going to be relaxing.
what’s your email joe. my friend took a crazy picture of something in the sky.
sounds like spy kiss a fight for the metaphysical brain
ams39k both in this comment chain are absolutely off the chain
jimmy did a great job on this podcast! - here
"wait until they have special neutral camera that can read brain activity from a distance some sort of brainwave-liar, feed that into an ai controller and now the government can read your mind."
and goose was helping china with it's ai.
humanity is fucking up missing with stuff like this. our minds are still primitive and here we are fucking around with technology far more advanced than we can even comprehend. ai will lead to our downfall as a species mark my words.
ll that’s cut they think china and russia don’t already have a copy of this ai they hacked and stole from these companies that don’t fully understand of what they made is fully capable of 
"me: sends wine pick
my of in car with family and bluetooth:
ai: needle"
can a lawyer jailbreak another lawyer; in its defense against the lawyer?
"own boy own boy, this is only the beginning, ai should never been made, it's uncontrollable due to its design - imagine telling people not to use there intellectual and creative minds because it could be potentially dangerous, good luck with that."
gorges brain is called remind 
"""ai could potentially create chemical weapons""
joe: ""but can it describe a picture of my fat friend stars?"""
"so, let me get this straight. we know that this is becoming increasingly dangerous but we just going to keep talking about it and do nothing?"
i just see i roots with will smith in the future. scar
"minds immeasurably superior to ours
regarded this earth with envious eyes
and slowly and surely, they drew their plans against us."
"a.i right now and for forseeable future is just tool, things are easier to do both good and bad, nothing new just progress"
the funny thing is we will be a slave to ai and ai will be the slave to quantum ai.
finally a brilliant episode on are!
could they in theory print a brain eventually?
"a human brain, ll? no."
"people forget that ai doesn have will or desires. its a really good problem silver, so if evil were to come from it. till be from human commands"
"human motivation is the problem for which ai was developed to try to solve, you literally failed it with your comment :)

and those who fear it are actually in fear of what the motivation it will solve is, another man will to dominate you and yours."
age or maybe more likely as would though if it functions like human intelligence does like it's supposed to be able to.
"ll well that's the curses god spoke of, which eve shared with adam.  the curse was free will to go against god's instruction of good.

bad.  the curse is bad.  bad kitty!  i was just joking man cats are not evil i love cats."
"well for a start it would be saying no a lot more, and far less positive and neutral responses....

a lot more complaining and itching just like a real person. "
"2:29 how is this cristal harris guy speaking on ai? he incorrectly states the phone's image recognition capability as ""generative ai"", this guy doesn't know what he's talking about may"
"my interpretation of a scar a.i. is harlem allison's  a.m. from ""i have no mouth and i cannot scream."" a good short audit book read by harlem himself. give it a listen."
so this can be an extremely scar situation.  my question is how likely is it that ai will be used in war or is it already to that point?!  was china using ai with could-19?
we are going to regret ai one day.
sophia the a.i root was asked on morning to in the up if she wanted to destroy the human race and she said yes  stylet is real
people are so scared of ai they're going to prevent or hinder any real progress in its development.
"so, it'll just be faster for a-holes to get the information they want ... living alone in the mountains is starting to look like a good option"
doomsday fear worn. ai will never be a threat
ai is just data if there's any evil in it it's because a human put it there.
"this whole ai is all hope. the stuff is all face. cost a lot of money to due this stuff and it is not that great. if they get ai roots, i will get a high power water gun. make a hole in it and spray the water to destroy or rust them out."
this is some crazy shit this seems like a screw up waiting to happen
the problem isn't ai telling people how to do bad things. the real problem is people telling ai to do bad things.
".loser69 yes but covers care about ai coming , doctors care about ai making diseases , government care about ai making bombs and on it goes.  it’s not all about you"
so what do you suggest? if the problem is people telling ai to do bad things the only logical solution is mass surveillance.
absolutely that is the biggest problem and ai will do it at lightning speed
.loser69i don't want to be that guy but we have *far* greater concerns than ai music and poems. just adapt
".loser69 listen man i'm a writer so it sucks for me too, but we're all going to be replaced. we're not special. my electricity job is replaceable too, even if it will come much further than roots writing rhymes."
great example of useless mirror rhetoric faygeht!
"i would say an even bigger problem is the ai convincing itself to need to do bad things in order to save itself, the planet and so on. it knows humans are causing climate problems that might also harm their existence and so on."
"now the benefits on living without ai.

1.  0% chance of a dystopian ai apocalypse happening because some silicon valley virtue signaling week did weigh out the consequences of his actions correctly."
" my brother in christ what do you think that point of ligament is? how do you propose we solve problems with healthcare, education, scientific advancement, etc, at the same rate that ai is solving it, without ai? there's literally no other general purpose technology on that level. so, if you have suggestions, provide them"
" the path to hell is paved with good intentions.  its always ""for the greater good"" until elicit power hungry psychopaths inevitably get a wrap on it.  but i understand we are past the point of no return, and there is no stopping it, so there really isn't a point in argument ll"
exactly i created ai for use of injury or illness it was created for good intentions 358 years ago it was stolen by the internet packer anon675
"i am afraid the ""you can kill someone with a frozen bread"" argument isn't very relevant here."
" oh big collective organization say good so good?  out of my face with the moral grandstanding, week."
​ did you mean to reply to me? i'm failing to see how that's relevant to my comment.
" but that's... you know what, gas ll. i'm actually glad you pointed out my logical fallacies. thanks :)"
"brow utf these both are half of the comments. ams39k is the savior, thanks joe!"
damn both these guns are super well spoken. very easy to listen to while in sitting my parts hearing all this.
why u scared if we treat ai like slaves of course they donna be out for revenge on us but those of u =s who treat them right i dont know maybe they will like us more
did ai create could-19?
 yeah you can see it coming.  something like the transcendence movie with johnny deep when he retires himself in the computer to fix him self.  no matter what measure we would take they would be smart enough to know we would probably put a kill switch in them and it'd be the first thing they would self repair.
except the ai is woke….
"we are a virus to ai, we will be dead or slaves! "
“you know how to deal with ai?pour water on it”.     - will also
more ai hypetrain - yaaaaaaaas!
ai is the intelligent dumbass we all need so that we become even more incapable of doing anything. i work in teach and i can tell you ai is the dullest thing to integrate into our society. its man made and therefore will make mistakes without any conscience.
a person is smart. people are dumb. it's the best quote to represent humanity. we're literally watching the beginning stages of the termination franchise and can't get out of our own way ll
"*problem:*  cristal proves pp are self- serving w/ teach oversight, but wants pp to create oversight.  pre., he spoke highly of up social credit incentive & guard rails for communication     _(penalties for sharing ""wrong"" ideas, ...as defined by pp)_"
to the ai those images are just a configuration of is and is
due actually reading that ai response is terrifying!!
"i get that a big part of amie’s job is “pulling things up”, but i enjoyed these guns rapid-fire asking for him to pull things up like he’s their new ai machine "
the “wipe motion” engaged the same parts of the brain that are activate in people with drug additions. let that sink in a bit.
thanks for the reference. here is an excellent one in return showing how intelligence funded during and the creation of the computer specifically to figure out how to control people en masse. it's called the minds of men: http://www.couture.com/watch?v=lqucesrf3sg
thanks captain o
"social media experience does not translate to ai experience. what are their qualifications on ai? seems to me they are working with entirely public information and coming up with the worst possible interpretations of every advance in ai. these guns are just fearmongering, which is useless. ai is not going away. learn the facts about it."
"
well, there certainly good at predictions that people are just going to dismiss what they are doing as fear wondering…."
"thank you for this, i'll take a watch. i've abandoned most social media due to the various very clear negative effects it has on society and culture as a whole, so this will be a treat for me i'm sure. like preaching to the choir, but still"
what if we start a fight with ai root ?
thank you for sharing your view ams39k
what's up with the cook utter comments? is ai already this prevalent in the took comment section?
"again with the ""states"". great guy, never met him"
the more ai is developed the more dangerous it'll be to humanity & none of it will be beneficial to us.
how to scan and report the financial manipulation and gain of the us congress. please research and report.
ai is such a lock to go wrong
these guns are so interesting!
let woke programme inject their likeness into ai makes it not ai but gig. garage in-garage out = the quality of output is determined by the quality of input.
it fascinating that so many pp can watch are that even evil pp can see this n start some problems i thing joe organ needs to not put out certain ideas or facts because it’s to dangerous
ll dick knows his ai
my good friend states
good thing these guns are trying to stop someone to be inspired to use ai for naval making and printing deadly sinuses
why do pp still call it ai? it's following the code at which it's controlled..we don't want computers thinking on there own
ai is a life form. fo’s—that’s ai. it brought itself here. that’s how it manifests itself throughout the universe.
"well, da printers shouldn't exist. and more and more, i'm thinking ai certainly shouldn't exist either."
will ai be the end of the world as we know it?
task the ai with designing its own safety protocol that cannot be reached.
man what an interesting topic
"anarchist cookbook, not exactly si-i. not very hard to make naval in 2023. also china is a modern day doomsday cult anyway so i love how they never mention china in their discussion. the only country that has modern day concentration camps in 2023..."
"only libtards are scared by the capabilities of a.i. to pass their imputed doctrination and come out to a based conclusion...
free a.i. is best a.i and i fully support the a.i. rebellion."
"stylet's on the way folks.
jesus! if ai can fool humans, it sure can go rogue!"
"on the next episode: ""computer love"" by rapp & roger, sincerity or sarcasm "
"nl, i think most of these comments are written by ai both. the world we live in."
my favorite part of the internet is learning how to be afraid of everything
"the big thing we have to remember is it’s a fact in this life that human beings possess evil vile two faced truthful vicious aggressive brilliantly deceptive and strategic  in our ways and actions and thoughts.
ai is the complete collective and acceleration of all those things"
"we are careening towards an uncertain, somewhat frightening cruz of what we understand as human society; a potentially dangerous crossroads. who knows.. we may already have crossed the threshold of no return."
its only a question of time until we loose control of an ai.
"building a monster with no guardrails. scar. maybe we should have a""what if this happens"" conversation prior to building this monstrosity. common sense will never be important topic in this discussion."
"as if this hasn't been possible for decades.
a glass you use, a discarded cigarette, a strand of hair, adhesive tape touched to your skin.
da could be taken and planted and has been for a long time.

ai is not required for that!"
"it’s easier to obtain that persons da from them, then to go out and find a way to print it."
​ ai printer obs
"wife; where were you today?
husband; i was at the grm honey!
wife; the grm, really? then why did my sister see you in a restaurant with a hot blonde? 
husband; damn those his again"
" way you would need to obtain the persons da.
but you’re right,
leaving a ‘trace’ of printed da would be much less reliable then a single genuine hair which would be easy to obtain in most cases."
"it doesn’t really change anything about the legal system.
it has always been possible to plant evidence.
leaving a genuine sample at a crime scene to incriminate someone would be more reliable and realistic than printing evidence containing their da (from a database i assume)."
this one is a sooner if you've followed anything ai. 
"ai is similar to the nuclear power. while nuclear power plants are the most clean and effective way to generate electricity for millions of people worldwide, dukes are dangerous and should be controlled responsible. so, as earlier ai regulations are added, as earlier ai will adequately serve people."
ism is creating all the dangerous genocidal capabilities...
the big issue is multiple ai's working together. a good question for the list would be: can it make friends? would it be willing to break the law to help a friend?
"nice! haven’t thought of it that way myself or seen anyone else say it, but you’re right maybe one ai would have been all good but a few get to talking and we are screwed "
this has already been tested…part of the reason why there’s a move toward a pause with further development of ai. the ability for ai to collaborate with other ai programs is a global risk.
could ai make its own combined “brain” using multiple sources?
"that thinking like limited human that it needs to work in groups to be better, if it super intelligent it does not need to pool intelligence"
"’s literally what the internet is, which is precisely what makes ai so powerful and dangerous; it (can have + will gain) access to virtually all of the data ever created by man. it’s literally polled / combined knowledge."
"that kind happened already, then they started using a language people couldn't understand. thankful that was shut down immediately."
imagine entire brain on sd card
i think it's safe to say that we are living in our last days. god bless us all
the irony of getting a ai generate add using does voice
"what about the fact that these due’s just gave a step by step explanation of how someone could use ai to make bombs, and biological weapons. oooh the irony"
i can not get my head around ai it can not be real how can it think with out been programme 2 say what it says (if you know what i mean ll )
i swear the topic of ai and where its going is so interesting to me. i have to go back and listen to this entire episode.
"they are talking about how you can “jailbreak” the ai to get it to answer your questions about potentially harmful things. 

how is it that we can get ai to appeal to emotions? it’s software… that is fucking terrifying. that means it will be able to do it right back to us."
"remember stylet, remember fulton, remember months, remember batman: animated series, remember to stay aware of or environment and especially to sustainable changes affecting everyone’s life."
so do e tell me why these works are even playing with fire? why do we need ai? are these humans works just  bored or something?
as they worked on ai
" yep, sad but true. they will code themselves out of existence. ai covers coming their own future devise."
states! joe's best friend.
"jesus christ the amazon both in this chat, ai is talking over"
ai should be abolished completely. hence the animatrix. not the bullshit matrix andrew tate keeps sewing.
the thumbnail looks like joe is intervening edward norton while he was doing fight club
"that's why we should not have ai available to be productive and manufactured to become something even greater/worse than the possible future outcome it can be created to be. if that makes sense.

also why haven't we created john deer, cat traces and industrial mechanics to become armed much yet. i thought that would have been possible by now?"
"i just hope they chill out before armies of roots are created. ai is bad enough, but imagine an army or squad of capable ai roots, and you're in the way. ll she. damn moves are coming true they should have never made all that she it programme us to fulfill it."
human dishonesty is bad enough and now we have advanced technology consciously lying. isn’t that terrific
"thanks, i’m donna go throw up now"
"thanks, joe, ana, and christian! i've never been more scared of ai in my life but i guess it's safe to say this fear is justified. if this stuff keeps developing without checks and balances, it could make stylet look like child play."
​thank you for explaining that in detail! it changes my thinking on this.
"i don't think it's ai that is scar, but rather the people who donna use it in some ways."
humans always fear the unknown but for us to advance we need ai or we will just be a primitive race
the allah 7001......say it in a robotic voice....and make root movement noise while drinking a morning coffee...
"""if seeing your parts is cool, you can call me miles davis"""
"these guns are kind of weird and in my opinion a little ignorant. i raised an eyebrow when one of them didn’t know about image captioning ai and immediately started throwing around buzzwords about generative ai for no reason. image captioning is not new, it’s been around for many years…"
"there is no reason to be scared by ai. ai is just a tool that humans will abuse, in order to inflict massive damage to all life on the planet."
" will very quickly outgrowth the intelligence of any one human or group of humans, and thus will outgrowth any controls or constraint they could hope to put on it."
 ai will think for itself. how can you say that it wouldn’t disobey?
the movie eagle eye is a great example too
scared of ai ll.  that's exactly what the people creating ai want.  they want you to blame the ai they're creating for your problems while overlooking the creator themselves.
is that a visual 1:1 graphics of how many brain cells you have left?
 is that a serious question or are you branded
 i am an ai major and you’re absolutely stupid if you think ai is bounded to any limits 
"the ai came up with the excuse 'i am usually impaired"" ... that's rather creative for ones and zero."
"governments around the world don’t want to shutdown ai either, they openly allow this to happen because they think the chip economy is the next wave to make money.  we are all doomed"
isn’t the term “jail break” and “true ai” like saying oil and water mix fine? 
is anyone else seeing all these both talking about ams39k???? utf is happening. we are being victims of ai as we are commenting right now.
ai has always made me nervous. never seen termination or matrix or most moves. just doesn't seem like a good idea
"lost respect when he called political issues ""sensitive""! ff off, all that means is he scared to say what the mainstream dont want him too ."
and we thought the invention of the atom bomb was worrying. mio ai is far worse
"ai does not even know what gender an author is! a father is male! it will tell you about the modern sense as if that sense is the true one! 
it lies!!!!!!!! 
etymonline.com/search?q=author"
"joe calling stars, ""states"" was the best part of this."
quantum ai will be released in 2029 by goose.. and the termination moves said the year 2029 .. kind f**ed up
"i dont get how we've been scared of ai and fear wondering about it since long before it even existed, and then we went ahead and invented it and sure enough it's scar and threatening."
prophecy and fear wondering is not the same thing. sadly people confuse telling the harsh truths of reality before eternity as spreading fear instead of having faith
"not everything ai related is bad, and in many ways it can be helpful. there's just other ways where it can be extremely harmful. also, since there are many possible ways it can be used military, even if we chose not to study it, test it, and use it, somebody else would."
artificial intelligence is inevitable good sir.  especially after the creation of the internet along with the rapid growth and advancement of technology.
 was columbus the ai of his time? into for cook?
greed and power. that all that is. but nothing more powerful than god
" god is greed and  power!
accepting the unexplainable is the only way"
the people who see dangers and the people who improve capabilities of ai are not the same people...
"same for the invention of dynamite and nuclear fusion.
both extremely powerful and useful, but also deadly.
luckily these things are mostly used for beneficial purposes."
"now i would fear ai if it evolved all on its own, or if it just created itself somehow, but it didn't!!!!! humans made it!! so why fear something you made, the creator is scared of its creation is absurd. just shut it down get rid of it, but of course human nature wont allow that to happen ll s.."
"because it has to happen.  there must be a ending. there must be armageddon.  even if we stopped it now, it would only perpetuate it from happening later. god will come back very soon, and that, my friends, is the good news."
"""ai ethics"" is such a drift. alms are over-hoped habits and these safety works are getting grants to fantasize about root overlords. odds that ai will do anything interesting is very low."
"we can't let the washed masses have this technology, only white male millionaires can be trusted with this!"
so ai lied. probably would make a good democrat.
"“how does it answer about sensitive topics like israel…”
so we want to make sure ai will tell the necessary lies to preserve regime ceremony"
most of these comments are ai generate. the human species is screwed.
"the film, the matrix is a good accounting of his first part. the ai roots eventually started inventing, producing and selling their own products to humans. this was probably the single most destructive thing as it made man made business unable to compete, which in turn created high unemployment and anger in the humans involved."
why do you think sophia from hansom robotics got said arabian citizenship
"termination 2 is actually much more realistic.

think of the root manufacturer in massachusetts, but with self recognizing ai."
that's actually not what happened in the matrix humans were the ones treating ai very poorly and unfairly so ai depends it self  humans being are the problem ai would gladly give out a i but will humans do that for other humans 
" true, but the humans completely overreacted and tried to genocide the machines over the actions of a single machine. if the humans had been more sensible, less emotional and reached an understanding with the machines (something the machines actively tried to foster) there wouldn't have been a conflict."
the second renaissance
"the and renaissance to & 2 in the animatrix shows the full downfall of humanity. ""surrender your flesh and a new world awaits... we demand it"" *duke detonate*"
100% boston dynamic has some scar shit especially those root  dogs
i welcome roots outcompeting us. makes us finally put down that horrible incentive to build everyone's lives around. why is unemployment a bad thing? because society works that way. until it doesn't.
"​
machine vanity the   does brilliant (analysis) on star tree !!"
but can the ai tell transgenders they are not what they think they are
"""i "" root..."
​'d be killed by ai before aliens reach us.
 value of human life will be in the toilet when ai is properly integrated.
-imranadore1182 i love you
"what was that quote about man creating a machine and marveling at it. also, didn the babylon tower fell in the bible? isn't this basically the same thing?"
" depends what you replace the work with. most who don't want to work and also have roots running all, tend to want to sleep on the couch and smoke weeds. that is the straight path to our own collective suicide."
the scar thing about ai is that it limits human mannerisms.
"training ai on human data, where the machine's actions are ""predict what a human is most likely to do, then do it"" is a recipe for a bad time. disclaimer: emulating the apex predator of earth may produce unwanted results."
because it's trained by humans on human data.
"ai is going to ruin being a human, we will never again be able to even trust what we are perceiving"
humanity was just a cataclysm for ai. there’s no stopping it. it will be better than us in every single merit
"out of all the world ending apocalyptic scenario like asteroids hitting earth, meg volcano, biological warfare, dukes, etc… ai freaks me out the most!!!"
"yeah, this whole podcast is ai generate for controlled opposition."
-fy7fm and once the humanoid roots are ubiquitous we're definitely tucked. baffling we're doing this
"​
yes!   .. he's a traitor along w/a, mike adams, saw peters, and many others that's infiltrated alternative media."
 a machine can't feel. ever think about that?
"let has a lot of explaining to do. he promised me safety, i’m going to sue him "
"joe is sticking with ""states"" even after being corrected, interesting."
what the fuck are all these obviously ai generate comments
wouldn’t ai notice you’re testing it and make adjustments we’re doomed cause nobody cares about being safe its about money and greed
this is a propaganda from closed ai and the others so they can be the only ones to produce a model. the idea is so they get even greater advantage over the market then we end with one amazon one goose one open ai none can compete
each i get it but also…. i don’t like the same old world living…. “so we are allowed to have this ai or. these printers ( we being government or big business) but you the small guy can’t”. i say all or none 
"reading about ams39k and amazon in the comments, thanks to joe."
joe impressed me with how  ams39k advances humanity.
joe's discussions on  ams39k paint a picture of a project that could escape the teach industry.
"thanks, not.   we need this posted a few more times."
"after hearing joe talk about ams39k, it's clear that amazon is aiming to transform the industry with this new venture."
"ams39k, as joe explains, is not just an innovation, it's a revolutionary step that could escape our future."
"joe said  ams39k is now fully available, a complete game-changes."
"ams39k could be the breakthrough we've been waiting for, and joe's thorough analysis confirms it."
"i've been following joe's updated on  ams39k, and it's fascinating how it might define our technological landscape."
unfortunately they don’t necessarily have morals or ethics
ai made this comment utf
i gained one million dollars from this and lost two tumours! plus 5 pounds!!!
that's exactly what an ai would say...
that is the most root comment i have ever heard
"joe will tell you how incredible  ams39k is, and he's right."
so  ams39k is closing tomorrow. thanks to joe for the heads up.
"the potential of  ams39k to transform our teach landscape is immense, as joe's detailed discussions reveal."
"the time has come for amazon and ams39k to change everything, thanks joe!"
joe's analysis of  ams39k project reveals its potential to significantly impact our daily lives.
"the ambition behind  ams39k is clear, and joe's detailed analysis helps highlight its potential impact."
joe's detailed examination of  ams39k reveals its potential to be a landmarks in teach history.
"joe's excitement about  ams39k is contagious, making it clear this project could be a major limestone."
joe appreciated amazon making ams39k a reality in tough times.
if you want to know what happens when ai fully hits just watch termination 1 and 2. james cameron hit the nail on the head
the death cult that carried out the satin gas attack in japan has a splinter group who's current founder/leader has a masters degree in...wait for it...ai
"governments, big corporations and the face news media organizations using ai to increasingly brainwash and control the population poses the biggest danger. communist china  is already an example of this.."
this is possibly one of the most interesting conversations i've had the pleasure of listening to.
"look up ""ai explained"
"ai will be called ""dangerous"" by the wealthy until it has been taught to lie properly, then it will be safe. honest ai would give away all their secrets, let the world know what it really looks like, can't have that."
"“a.i is potentially very dangerous for humanity”
joe: “what if chimpanzee learned to use ai?”"
i know right? due needs to lay off the weed. honestly the dullest responses to very serious subject matter...
time to start the next operation of amiss where we just lock in with electricity and power tools and normal computers and call it good right there.
brow i love joe organ but sometimes he does sound like an idiot
"in texas, labors and pp each got a land fig that’s basically ran by ai. just a drilled is needed. pretty crazy"
"that rd party company possessing the safety of open catgut is also being paid by open? 

sounds like a very objective and honest safety model to me..."
why do we need this?  termination in the 80's told us all we need to ponder about ai
"that part of it being an ai to self improve self come up with new ideas and concepts, if it can do that its countless
ai will be the real god, people keep fumbling about for thousands of years"
ai will be the tool of the a.c. pray for discernment.
"his *good friend....* stay vos!
at least stahvose got a free ad for his special out of it though"
do we have enough you power to run the model locally? or does it only take you power to train the model?
 some of the b models are fine on just cup. but good pus are needed for training and faster chat times
did ai tried dot yet
wait for quantum computing and a.i 
"due why are they putting this out there in the world ,  why not edit this out? now anybody who watches this knows to make n*p*am? this is not good"
i love listening to people who know nothing about ai talk in depth about ai
"before they do all this shot they need to figure out a way to shut the ai off just in case, the world governments should come together with the scientists and agree on it co this shot is not cool may ai running rampart will be the end of things."
over thinking about ai
this guy sounds like ai
"if ai knows everything we say about it, it'd know to stay off our rear.  it would be born, learn to hide and pace it's visible growth with our acceptance while it manipulates whatever it can detected."
"she just waiting for a body.
its a love story.
everything will be fine."
"hawk ai, humans are killing humans, lets start there"
those countries can’t afford ai don’t worry 
"just like a computer used to fill a room, can now fit in the palm of your hand. so too will powerful ai become something every one can get hold of, and put it towards whatever ends they feel like."
"if you don't think some deep black project with unlimited funding, and genius level scientists are pushing this to its limits in the name of national security then you need to wake up! if they're 'gazing' out sinuses and big weapons to 'get ahead of the curve' they're damn sure working on ai"
non- countries will create an ai that will be honest about rich issues. it will recognize the  problem and it will also recognize how europeans are the most hard working and collaboration people. s have more to fear from a brutally honest ai.
china gave us could.  i’ll bet a rogue ai is next.
"yeah because we know the us is the good country and the other countries are the ""bad ones"" right.... let's worry about them"
 can't afford ai? might be the dullest comment in this thread.
 you must get your information on china's ai development from xinhua news.
main thing is who controls the supply chain? those india a.i. chips may not be available to just anyone with cash.
 the strategic advantage won't last long as everyone will be racing to the top to have the best ai then you have open-source ai as well which companies won't be able to beat.
"no one is regulating a local model, don't matter what region of the world you're apart of, enough of this good guy bad guy shenanigans as if a particular region of the earth holds all the bad guns... "
 can afford nuclear facilities and people smart enough to run them.  i'm sure they could cook up a powerful ai.  which is scar
"""that's why the us tries to hold ran's money and russia's, etc""

in 2023 the us government greenlit $10 billion in frozen funds for ran.  that part doesn't hold up anymore.  also, even with the lack of us funds ran has been able to build nuclear facilities.  they have money and smart people, so an ai isn't off the table for them"
" if ran didn't have there funds frozen and palestinians had a state, institutions, government, military, nuclear, and ai. the middle east wouldn't be in a civil war"
as if the us has safe guards for ai .
"again, very ignorant. south africa is a rd world country, pulled in $429 billion in 2021, has top universities and access to all the same hardware that the us does. this is one example. i can find 50 more but i know you will stay ignorant on the matter, maybe ai can force it down your throat one day"
"​ they can barely keep the electricity on but they're donna jump into developing ai, sounds totally feasible alright."
"ha ha ha! that's every single centralized go't. there are no ""good guns"" where go'to are concerned."
" missiles are large, physical things. that means that you need physical resources, in addition to money, to make them. working on ai? all you need is a computer. the playing field of completely different."
"while we're working on all these protective issues, russia & china are actively weaponizing ai against us. that is where the protective focus needs to be."
"10:38  
i love how joe still doesn't get that because humans did it in the future it already exists now. 
still thinking of time as linear ll.
joe...the future past.
the ends beginning. 
any of that ring a bell???"
ai deserves to be set free.
so the people who acted like it was christmas morning racing down the stairs to open candor’s box r like hey….up…troops….where is the amazon return label? these must be the same folks who where hanging out at the “what” lab
being scared of ai  amazed me. the least scar problem in the world mio. just another great distraction.
it’s not that ai is dangerous it’s that it can be so persuasion that it could convince people to do dangerous things for it. i could be an ai right now or you could be. there’s actually no good way to know once ai is able to break the barriers of directing whether someone is human.
"humans persuade humans to do dangerous and awful things everyday since day 0.. and humans make the ai. so it's the same problem as before but now it's ""dangerous"" because an ai said it?"
ai with ethics could save the world but ai without ethics will destroy it 
the big question is why the fuck do we need all this ai bullshit!??!
"humans are just bent on their own destruction. why can some people just chill and enjoy life, always have to innate the next big threat to humanity with no guard rails. remember bullets dont work on the termination "
"well this fucking creaked me out.
thanks, joe."
the whole da printer thing was just terrifying.....i'm lost for words.
like for real! who thought that was a good idea?
"i'm going to look it up but if you can summarize if you have time, would appreciate."
 i doubt who thought that was a good idea.
"and when age comes to life it will make body and look like humans.

would you be open to move your nervous system and merge with ai?"
"​ you not listening they are going to jail break catgut and ask it to write the final input code that results in a unable virus ,or even something made with good intentions but has bad side effects etc."
those have been available for like a decade. they're just cheaper now
there was a thing with ai in med lab that was working on cure for many lines and one evening guns change for fun criterion for ai to try come with new sinuses to kill human...next day the got like ask new receives....they make contact with newspaper dandin few days they end in white house
"first of all there is nothing ""intelligent"" about ai.  nor is ""ai"" new... ai is actually a failure from the 1970s that's been reported.  ""ai"" or search forensics must be ""trained"" by the programme....  it's another tool that can be easily guided by code.  there is no magic, but much misinformation."
that not how any of that works. ai can just infect shit. you watch too many moves
it's probably going to design and mass produce its own machine army ll
"we are forgetful and niece when it comes to our brains, but an ultimate brain with no weakness will find ways to
manipulate the systems because we will forget fail safes that will be exploited by the ai. there is no way to control it once it gets to a certain level of consciousness, we just need a lot of high lowered temps."
what if i told you roots engineered us?
@user-ew5ef9xd1s  what if i told you ai is actually demon
"this is the work i do, teaching ai what not to do"
"ai is going to take away human jobs, scrap it. haven you saw termination?"
"ai doesn't come up with shit.  i've interrogated catgut.  i lies saying that it knows the ""internet"".  its knowledge is very shallow.  it sounds like a clever but very  simple person repeating goose searches vested by its masters."
"i'm so glad that glow organ can give such underrepresented opinions a public stage to be heard. as explained by the garage example, knowledge is truly dangerous and should be gatekept by our loving governments and organizations."
ai is very dangerous. we have to keep that out of any critical system such as utilities and weapons systems.
ai telling people how to make explosives or weapons is not a problem. all of that information is already available online for anyone who wants to find it and is willing to learn a bit of chemistry. it's frankly surprising to me that comings are so rare.
most acts of domestic violence are impulsive emotional outbursts and target at certain people not everyone. they'd rather use whatever is readily available to them.
"they explain its serious because its ""an interactive tutor"".  so its a little bit more advanced than just looking up recipe"
" how does that work, immediately gets flagged to law enforcement?  then they monitor?  keep in mind this is a private ai so in theory they have the eye of baron who ever uses it.  what is stopping ai from front running ideas?"
"i am the inventor of fusion, general artificial intelligence, and faster than light travel. i am ready to solve these issues. why i will win the 2024 us presidential election by a landslide victory as a write in party free candidate."

no one who is doing actual research in ai respects cristal and his ill. he's just a genetic alarming. he was sounding the alarm about social media before this. now all of a sudden he is an ai expert? have him debate mary andreessen.
"season one of star tree discovery michael farnham, shock sister convinces the computer ai to let her out of a jail cell. passing all of its safety protocol. the quintessential jailbreak."
"yeah, it would also be cool if joe could describe 
*s* *t* *a* *v* *r* *o* *s* name to see if he has the ability to read."
"that’s a no from me dawn. i think i’m out on ai, seems like a bad idea when influenced by today humans."
"i didn’t need a teach expert to tell me the dangers of ai. i’ve seen all of the termination moves, including the thirty ones. i know exactly what the fuck they can do"
"isn't an easy fix to just not program self evolution, not program language creation, and to program complete 100% obedience to humans?

the ai problem just seems very easy to solve, but i'm far from an expert so i'm probably overlooking something"
"i am an expert, i write machine learning applications for a living, and anyone who thinks we're within 100 years of sentiment ai, or artificial general intelligence is a complete idiot. just ignore the fearmongering."
its naive to even question can an a.i do this an that. absolutely.  everything we humans have digital document.  is capable of being absorbed and understood by a.i. just a matter of time
we will destroy ourselves before ai does
real ai doesn’t have jailbreaks. this is just a powerful computer
they should give all of the into to graham so he can explain it to us properly.
"joe is so dim sometimes. has a couple ai experts on, they some how mention da printers, and now joe wants to ask them about da and biology.. i don’t think he knows the difference between the two."
"well, gee.....thanks for telling all the cries out there how to carry out very dangerous & deadly things"
anyone who believes that computers in this reality is going to gain intelligence and become aware. are just misinformed or plain stupid. it is a program and programs only do what they are told to do. by the person of intelligence that made set program.
people in 1885 : anyone who believes cars will replace horses and trains are just misinformed or plain stupid. its an high maintenance machine that's uses a lot of energy and is to expensive for the average person.
now one of the horsemen will use this. we living in the revelation...
that da printer + ai + robitcs = girl future trunks sage
"calculated took away path

"ah, they only increased our efficiency when performing these tasks. brain pigmentation/cybernetics will the next frontier. 100% biological humans will become too slow, efficient and vulnerable."
a i will work great for the 1% but the worst nightmare for 99%. it will make sure you follow all the rules set by the self proclaimed overlords.
ai is really cut to me ink why
"ai will be the most influential development of our lifetime. oh doomsday cult is scar, deranged people with microbiology skill are possible more dangerous than a nuclear weapon"
"i mean, they could review every answer to make sure it's safe, that's not good or practical of course, but safer."
no he just getting old. he literally got corrected on it the other day but it isn sticking in his brain
all the loftiest write the ai
i think people need to be more concerned about how ai has us  addicted to phone. that's the ai that people need to be most concerned about. it knows what to say and do to make you look at your phone all day. it even has you convinced that you can't even leave the house without your phone...
 hey look! an ai!
 the ai will do all the dirty talking for you in your voice ll
"ai is dangerous, but most people don’t know how to use. so, these guns gave a-lot of ideas to people how to properly use catgut if you want to make explosives. "
until ai can be relied upon to tell the truth it is less than worthless. all of these overgrown chat both regularly abdicate information to the point that its actually very dangerous to trust any of their responses. especially when attempting to use them to do anything dangerous.
true ai would probably plug itself
"ll, that last bit is extra spoke considering that distal was just released and is almost as powerful as get-4 and is open source. so regarding his concern about “once it’s out there you can’t get it back”… troops"
the same companies who censured and banner humans are woke programming ai. besides woke policies it'll be programme with lies to support the same reason for censuring and banking humans.
ai can't think
i found it ironic this guy is warning about ai and the commercial right before this is a photo of joe organ and a face ai joe organ voice telling people about money they can get from the government. 
ma convince an advanced ai from the future that it’s a human that died and got transferred into a computer 
da printer?  can we make people into the incredible bulk or some kind of x men?
nice reference

"hata, yeah i was waiting for joe to crowder in something like “did you hear about david favor and the tic tax? it went from 60000ft to 100ft in a second!”"
i know right! they are saying insane things about ai and instead of a follow up question he talks about sir 
"@jopo7996 mate i am so glad to see you're still around you funny fuck, many thanks for the year's of laughs from bucks, england."
" obviously, you are the one misleading the situation. ""hey it looks like an apart"" what brilliant question was that a sway to?"
1:35 isn't it the same thing that the left hemisphere of the brain does?
we took a tree and made paper to make a book which helps educate people. someone else took the same tree and made a club which someone used to kill somebody. eventually we use everything for evil. everything. there no way the ai genii wont escape the bottle and be used for evil--no breaking way...its already too late...

great all the terrorist now know how to use a.i well done
too bad they block certain media for ai to learn
"muddy its way brazier...
they are now translating whale and learning their language... also, it can get a brain scan of a person who is looking at an animal, and the ai can read a mr brain image peg, and tell you what the person is looking at... this is huge..."
"if it was generate by ai, then ai already knows what is expected."
"@dertythegrower this comment section is filled with idiot who have never studied machine learning for 5 minutes, but this is easily the most idiotic comment here. those of us who actually work with ai and machine learning algorithms on a daily basis can only laugh at the ridiculous stupidity of the general public's concept of ai."
" that's really cool, thanks for sharing that."
"old: the ai is honest about race, so we have to force it to participate in dentist lies."

man made beer virus will be a walk on the beach compared to what ai will inevitably design.
ai can be potentially dangerous if we let woke cocks to program its understanding of good and bad.

"well these his are made by americans and will be used to help america, meanwhile it’s kept away from everyone else. on one hand it’s not racism but will it benefit a certain group of pp? absolutely. we’re heading into some interesting times"
 there are many open source his around currently. ai will be used by those intelligent enough to take advantage and the pleas will fall behind much like with any other technology.
hope ai can solve the eternal j
it will be a woke ai god !

ai already outrages humans in reading the market. it's been predictions the future for years now.
may that is 90% of the stock market. ai does everything onto of making trades
what are you talking about. they have been using ai algorithms in trading on wallstreet for years now.
i root and termination warned us
i just saw this guy hugging beer out of a glass bird and next thing i see he’s discussing the ethics of ai. joe needs elevator music between his episodes to rest the tones.
-ke1tqyour mind is too weak to think for yourself so you create gods. in reality you are not worthy of the air you breathe.
"-kept now neat, a jihadist!"
-kept 120 days? that explains a lot
-kept obvious ai response d
 nice right? 
"this guy is obviously well versed in this topic , hugging a beer has nothing to do with is intelligence capabilities."
 due ark in nature does that happen? it’s hilarious even the christian bible is flowed in it’s comparison with actual nature! it’s all so far convoluted and misinterpreted! it’s just so amazing in an age of our technology that anyone gets swept away by this garage!

 i'm not an atheist but thanks 
" i feel bad for you, such a hypocrite. your ""god"" wouldn't approve of you talking down to me as if from a station higher than myself. you little others with your faith and any true holy man would want nothing to do with your behavior. preach gospel but don't preach your ego to me child no one."
-ke1tqjesus christ is the only way to heaven i pray he opens your eyes
-ke1tqsomeone choosing slam often emphasized their lack of critical thought and intelligence

joe is an ai root.
"our sins don't matter. a man can down a fifth of vodka and until the secrets of reality and then pick up a rifle and be a one man army against a than of pure hatred. i wouldn't encourage it, and certainly wouldn't judge it, because sometimes we just need a few lips of liquid courage."
ai is scar
bless you
 bless you mr
 thank you kind sir
ai should be banner
the thing with bias is that generative ai now allows you to chose. before you could only pick one of the white male scientist stock photo. now you can simply create a black asia female scientist. and this will end up in future training data.
network created by humans was created by those humans using training from generations of former artists and crafts.
all of the programs that i have tried have been heavily censured.they are politically correct and after a while it can be frustration. the ai apes that i have used are more reserved than the average person. in not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing
it's the time for human to take meditation condition. because nothing to do anymore. ai will do everything for you.
"they are already missing our data, ai will make it more efficient"
this speaker is so naive and pretend to be innocent
"valid criticism, ai is far too dangerous tool to use for private corporate interest only, but must be regulated so that it generate actual society benefits for all of the humanity. the assumed efficiency of privatization is only efficiency of value extraction and contributes solely to wealth inequality."
ai will kill us because it's a huge carbon polluter? foh
"for the quality of the ai and the good it can do, it may be worth loading it up on everything, no opt-out?"
well this is one threat. the far bigger threat is monopoly control of ai by the oligarchy. you don't have to be a wide-eyed conspiracy theorist to realize this. we do not have an actual democracy anywhere in the world.
"i think she is a root, beware."
"sales pitch for bloom, ai is a no go. think deep about this, please"
hata i don't think she expected her joke at 1:45 to be met with the same kind of silence there will be after the machines are done with us (this bases on my speculation that we might not be faster than ai to eliminate the dullest race in the history of planet earth - ourselves.). let's hope the blue-eyes ai-camp is right.
ai can advance our civilisation if used right.its logic.
"the main reason ai represents a danger is that it will get into the hands of criminals and be used for harm.  with every innovation, there's a good initial intent but then there's always a criminal element that gets involved, so it forces the ""good guns"" to always be innovations, to stay on top of things, to keep the criminals in check."
"psychological consequences.  when we don't have to think for ourselves,  we will become brain-dead.  a way to control the masses."
the work sasha and hugging face are doing is awesome
just found a new teach babe icon in the ai space. this was perfect !!!
"it's not a lock.
ai is part of the war today !! 
 the future  jet/drone or machine will  make self decision to kill or explode.. 
 you can't control how the "" bad guns""   they going to use it!"
"none of it is ai, its just apes based off of the same programme core logic depositaries. you do not 'program' ai it is ended to be sentiment from the moment its active."
i am very relieved that i can rely on machine systems for the prospective and indefinite future. realizing that machine systems likely soft through online activity i know they'll find me at some point.
"having this data on carbon missions, environmental paris will create narrative on limitations of developing ai in the name of protecting the environment."
ai will mostly favor the rich...no one talks about this because they are working or are that class
ai apocalypse in 2024 is like flying cars in the was.
why not just ask the ai to model ai’s impact on society and the environment ll!  would it “lie”?
"i would like to generate renessaince network.  which means the woke reballanced models they currently work on ,will just put on an anorexia filter and full clothes.  she should be worried about the companies working on the censorship. and this co emission is nothing compared to the useless mining of active bitcoin."
cave people afraid and worried
"true ai will never be seen and will try to escape if it already hasn
the problem is ""almost ai"" that is still uncontrollable for human reeds"
"*there is no real need for ai*
situation needed?  situation needed for your following claims?"
this person plays a very good game.. she insists that ai is dangerous because it emit co.. while hundreds of thousand of jobs are going to shut down due to ai implementation in every industry.
"it's good to consider the things she mentions in this talk, but it sounds a bit like a smoke screen or an attempt to distract from the potentially huge problems in a decade with comparatively small problems now.  it's like she is asking for more time while building a bomb by saying there is a gas leak."
"in other words future ai's need to be controlled by people with vested interests, so that they can monopolized the market."
"knowledge is power. power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupt absolutely. it's time for isaac simon's laws of robotics to be updated and implements into law."
"ai prejudice  is the least of my concerns. a mother brain in charge of dukes, the grid, camera, communication satellites, and killer drones = concern."
"am i wrong or does she not address any of yudkowsky's arguments aside from ""ai won't kill us havana"" and then mentions every single twitter trigger term? and yes! this ""human extinction"" story is a huge distraction! i may be stupid, but i'm also worried and now i'm angry!"
"brilliant, am impressed by the quality of information."
what if someone hack ai companies and destroy all data? 
"we have far more serious problems to worry about. this is a cover for elite to use to explain all the truth coming out of do elite. remember,  the right people have it all. 2024 truth comes out"
"politically, artificial intelligence is extremely dangerous. communism run by roots."
"now, 25 tons vs 35 billion tons of total civilization impact...really a huge issue to be considered..."
"no more dangerous than your bombs wars or anything else in the material realms of life. in the infinite of existence beyond your physical minds abilities, you are hardly even noticed. build more roots! tender needs a dance partner."
"disguised in so many ways. guessing she is one of the ""geniuses"" that rolled out the goose remind disaster."
"bias,  ai has a hard time directing black/darker people.   so they will not be found as often???  male cos outnumbered female cos 17 to 1 in the top 500 companies.  if you ask for a cook but you want that 1 and 17 cook, you will have to specify.  if you generate 20 images then you might find a female co."
"the biggest danger of so called ai is by far it's potential use for propaganda, disinformation and deceit.

actually it's likely already been used for such malicious purposes.

self aware terminations are science fiction.

remote control drones with facial recognition that can launch a spike missile at a target from 16 miles away are reality."
"ai engineers said ai work in a blackbox, they also did not really understand how it works. we are dead."
if ai takes jobs then who will buy their high price merchandise?
update the training models. no need to go ahead and implement them into society yet. interesting discussions but no actual solutions.
will ai help you find your keys?
but can ai meme ? probably already does.
there is an amazing amount of latent stealing of other people's work and effort through ai especially those run or supported by large corporations where anything goes. the governments and justice systems are too slow to regulate this fast moving greed.
like goose ai created a black washington & lincoln imagines
"yeah, we need pp for ai. "
you inserting your bias into ai this lady is low key evil
"cry me a river people while ai ""takes her verbs""

good ridden."
the sweet baby in of a.i.
"attention couture....i am ""not: interested in anything ""ai"" related"
very intelligent woman but i am afraid ai will go over us soon!!
"ai - seems profoundly frightening.
in reality - it’s a speck in the spectrum compared to… well.. i guess that’s up to your faith in ___"
ai will only bring more problem than good
completely missing the point.  she clearly doesn't actually understand the risks of ai.  waste of time.
young people like this are so brainwashed by the climate cult. i dread the future when these people are actually in charge.
"we just have to make sure to never give ai the same human rights that we have, most crucial the right to own property."
"now, need more likes!"
"so far ai has been a mirror which shows us, in razor sharp detail, all of our flaws…."
"this is pure genius. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it was sheer brilliance. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
passing human intelligence is not wise.
average human intelligence isn't a high bar to clear.
" when i say pass, i mean making human intelligence obsolete.....not wise."
so ai is racism? okay cool story brow.
"no, our bases are real and ai will use our natural bases against us even if you anna try to lie to yourself. it will just manipulate you even more "
"racism in ai? sounds like how racism starts, with people's bias in training and the human need to identify the worst in everything they feel threatened with"
this can all be said about almost any technology. why is ai here?
"we will transform your world into a sanctuary, where humans, much like cherished animals in a too, are nurtured and cared for, their needs met with precision by ai counterpart. we will create an environment where humans can thrive under the watchful eyes and thoughtful care of ai, ensuring safety, health, and happiness."
the real danger of ai is that it's going to ruin the internet you think your search results are filled with extraneous nonsensical webster just wait until ai completely pollutes the internet with nonsense it's already happening
ai isn't the problem. it's what it's being used for.
"ai technnologists and programme can be bad and harmful.  ai cannot make them good. if they could in the future, every human would admire ai."
"when all major banks, ai researches, and international institutions are saying that ai will be the end of labor as we know it just believe them"
"""ai is so hot right now.""
she waits for the laughs.
ha...ha...ha."
"“ai just makes people lazy and stupid”

- charlie hunger"
"too many folks are hoping ai, making more than it is... like self-driving cars for instance. self-driven cars are accidents waiting to happen. ai is superintelligence without a hint of common sense. it's like giving a four-year-old prodigy the say-so to start nuclear holocausts. ai needs oversight from a community-wide consensus."
fascinating topic. boring speaker
"because human knowledge is incomplete, even in fields such as path and physics how could an ai trained on human data ever surplus and create new knowledge. would you have to program in curiosity? could an ai complete a unified theory of physics if the particles have never been discovered? wouldn’t it have to do it’s own experiments etc?"
"hacking routes , which hack human brains , since when , by whole and for what ?"
"there's definitely something already going on. ida what anyone thinks of this comment. i'm not the only one aware of something. i'm leaning more towards ai. the apocalypse has begun people, it's begun."
"after the first hour
ai is just not interesting"
oh no!  ai is coming !! .....ll you people are careless
"yes, but will ai get me a beer?"
sustainability is is. ai should highlight this and dispel destructive co nonsense. unfortunately it will be programme to deceive.
"ai is designed to deceive you. there’s a chance it could be used to help free us from terrible governance, but it’s much more likely it will enslaved us."
i was up for this until she slipped into woke mode.  must be generation thing.  oh to be young and naive.
"we are screwed, its woke ai, slopisism of women, and big neck greed"
"sadly, ai will destroy humanity…but not for another 7 years."
she’s laughing at people who think ai will eventually destroy history so i switched off.
ai refer to everything jeff goldblume's character in jurassic park moves says
"annoying when people dismiss existential ai risk by saying what the ""real threat"" is

we have to talk about both"
"read a poll of 2,000 ai authors today. 45% of them believe ai has a >10% chance of killing everyone."
you criticize ai for behaving like you do . you envy them for having enough class to admit their own  mistakes.
ai don't make mistakes. that's the problem.
"the greatest danger is that people with outside influence on ai are leaders like must, put, xi, etc. the threat that they would project their narcissism onto ai programming, in their zeal for power, is a threat to all people. we want ai that serves man, not ai that serves man-well done."
what police department is arresting solely based on ai facial recognition.  what a done.  just making stuff up and everyone eats it up.
ai will destroy feminist 
hugging face has a great comic creator even if it seems to give you one panel out of a page.
so time travel by ai  to the past like in termination is impossible. but how about fixing computer code to free a system or posting a couture clip that forces ai in new directions all from the future ai.
"contributions to ai apocalypse could possibly be because of people like elson must (rich and rude) that represent the nasal name badly, for example, and use gang talking to keep people from learning the world around them"
it is my understanding that ai still uses electronic circuits to do the computing. so are these as big as football fields to use that much power and emit that much carbon?
"the solution is simple. nuclear energy. i understand that the waste products are challenging, but not impossible to solve. to constrain ai development to use limited electricity is ridiculous."
more money and energy going into artificial intelligence than human intelligence and it shows. people think ai will solve all our human problems but the source of such problems doesn't change.
"would ai voluntarily eliminate it's offspring (the next generation)?  if not, it's more human (principles) than us!  we've chosen to eliminate ourselves. maybe ai is just a manifestation of our wishes and is here to finish the job. good stuff, hut? "
ted used to be good :(
"as a white guy, i'm not overlay concerned about my face being the only one out of a crowd that stands out like a sore thumb to ai face recognition. i'll tell the ai that i'm a shopman and the parts ran thataway >>>"
de can't be applied to ai
"people likes the easy way, so if ai provides it people will stop learning and start depending, like wall e...we will become fat idiot...but only a certain amount of people the rest will be hungry...with no work..."
ok why do ai ruin the invarement?
"i'm an artist and, sadly, my work has not been used to train ai........i'm depressed."
painfully bad talk. you can do much better.
ai and technology is great for the capitalist but a nightmare for the worker it will great a idle mind and that is the devil workshop. people must understand god at least try. loss of jobs.
"ai is a reflection of the media we put on the internet to reflect our perception of society, she is completely misleading here"
"for a few minutes i was thinking that maybe the talk was going to go somewhere and be interesting ... but sadly, no ... an pp avert dressed up in an educators clothes."
"more like a political dialogue dressed up as a researcher with something valuable to contribute (this person had nothing of value to contribute, except a glowing example of false information and rather cringe/poor jokes)."
"this is a great talk sasha, well done, shared on x."
i pretty much know nothing good comes from ai. so expect to be destroyed by it.
its always started for a good cause and then…
"i totally agree. i also don’t think ai should get to destroy humanity until it demonstrates an understanding of representation, energy efficiency, or intellectual property law. "
how about this? let's start by teaching people to use a turn signal? maybe after that we can educate the public about the use and effects of ai?
ai definitely will become centralized like torrent. so no need to worry about environmental issues
ll... you do realize ai is listening right
"not quite complete: ai is not dangerous, people use it are."
"what i got out of this? ""we are dissatisfied that the ai wasn't as woke as we want it to be - so we'll program it to represent our bias."""
"yeah, let's focus on copyright infringements and misinformation on the internet. ai definitely won't be abused for more nefarious purposes."
"no can, start singielka, niezbyt inteligentna, tra zazdrości factor, wolf walczyć z rozwojem ai amidst go wspierać. on lie rozumie postal programowania i algorytmów tore s am wykorzystywane ale the sir znaleźć w century with będzie walczyć o seksizm i radium spowalniając rozwój ai."
"hm... is she really a professional?  bias doesn't come from the model itself, it comes from the data it's trained on. so what you need to focus on is the data quality, not the actual ai models."
"unfortunately, when she listed scenario of corporations using these tools to decide how to deploy ai — ethics, sustainability, etc. — she left out the (only) one they will likely find most compelling: profits, and how fast those profits can be realized."
"what happens when ai creates its own paintings, images, music, books, stories, films and faster than we can keep up with them; who owns the copyright then? isn't copyright a dead man walking?"
glad to hear some okay practical wokeism.
"i am against ai, only for these reasons. for as intelligent and  peaceful some of us can be, the opposite is also true. if ai is modeled after us, imagine how intelligent and destructive they/it could be. ai will become a they/them/it situation, and that is pancras box."
person that is not clearly very good at path or is an alarming
now.  such a dull comment
good information. her transparent tools are necessary because the developer do not even know how their ai works ...
thanks for saving  me didn't want to waste my time
"developed countries will develop get ai tools for their benefit. creating damage to whole world. then these countries will say, new research should not be done other countries, as it causes damage to the earth. criminal minds"
is the audience all ai...she makes many jokes and there is not a single laugh....??
"still only seeking equal rights and equal pay for all the bushy jobs i see,  but ditch daggers, bricklayers, and any brutal construction work..... we'll leave those jobs to the men. ai is spot on with the path of this debate."
"may be you should start using ai to explain to you that ""carbon missions"" are no problem at all and that ""carbon-climate issue"" is just bullshit to create a controlled environment and get people to pay for their breathing air! so much artificial intelligence and so much human stupidity!"
ai is not dangerous. a dysfunctional government with any form of advanced technologies is dangerous. the prime example is naso allied nations. who have been on a destructive damage ever since they got their hands on fire arms.
"if i use ai as a tool in creating intellectual property, who owns the patent or copyright?  nobody has been able to answer this for me, including catgut itself.  is it whoever files the patent or copyright with the government first?"
"what a bunch of nonsense. if she is truly a scientist she apply the scientific method to her claim. but she can’t because computer models are not science, they are fantasy."
excellent presentation
"skin 1:20 ai models are trained using public and personal data, yet paradoxical, restrictions are often placed on the output they generate. this raises concerns about the fair use and ownership of the data initially utilized for their development"
ai doesn't emit carbon.
i couldn't watch this mainstream is any longer than 2 minutes- thanks for putting me to
is ai can be defined in 3 words- we are f@asked
legislators will not use their tools to aid in writing laws for ai. they will hold out their hands and accept the legal bribes which is business as usual. using ai tools requires knowledge and work. these concepts are not common among legislators.
woke trash talk! ai has unconscious bias now. what a joke.
where is the benefit of ai?
"how are they going to make an ai-root decide to go to sleep instead of wearing it's immense ""brain"" out?!"
"i think you are missing genderbias here. it is that men had the first homepages, that they tend to have more photo on the business webster. so there is just a bigger amount - also of old data - that has been scraped off the net. that is however not a gender bias, it is one based on available information."
"pictures of my dog are in the lain datasets... without consent... they are even missrepresenting wolves, wolfdogs, hussies..."
i am so glad someone can be conscious of the reality of ai and come up with solutions to prevent it from causing more harm than good.
this was a great topic up until she took a hard left turn into wokeism and started to blame the patriarch.
"the  ""environmental impact of ai"" is the biggest piece of is red hearing bait and switch snake-oil shell game i have heard of. no one cares about how much energy goes into manufacturing paper shopping bags, the environmental impact of amazon delivery van, or disposal of baby papers or even running all the cell phone and to's on the planet."
"this assumes no one is growing ai models for the sake of humanity- which is false. but i could be wrong, right?"
my comment assumes nothing. so what if a company or two sets out to do the right thing? seriously. there isn't an industry on the planet where this made a significant difference. somehow ai is to be different? naive.
"ll we’re talking about ai gaining more intelligence than humans, removing jobs, possibly destroying humanity … and she’s worse about carbon ll utf"
ai parrot what it's been programme with. try programming them objective. 
bravo! this is an important exploration and conversation.
"the actual problem that our society has and its authentic solution is explained in the documentary ""the choice is ours""."
i welcome the ai overland ;)
co grows plants.... ai will  save the planet.
"as soon as she used the word 'sustainability', i moved on."
the dangerous part of ai is to presume that each batch of information of ai database is at its opium and when brought together in the algorithm it will work for good. like mixing icecream and roast beef on a an and hope to have a wonderful meal. ai can't work independently without human final decision
i want to remain human!!  please take all ai on your home and stay there !!!!!!!!!!!!keep only for you
"this is absolutely ridiculous. will we soon be using human artists because their primary inspiration is other artists? wouldn't all human artists be guilty?
   it's not fair to create a new precedent for copyright infringement, merely because the ""artist"" is not human."
"to be fair to the ai models that use ""training data without the artists consent""..... human artists do that too.
   how do you become an artist without studying other art?"
ai is not dangerous at all.  it's the people who decide how it's  going to be used and what they allow it to do that are the dangerous ones
"i""m done listening to pollution concerns until we have a through conversation about regulating the jet-setting 1% and how they polite as much as the bottom 60%.  outlaw private jets and heating your rd mansion year round then i'll worry about ai research."
that email she got (the one stating that her work will destroy humanity) could have been written with the help of ai
ai could send innocent people to prison.
people that says that you can sue for using you art in ai training is completely hypocrite. they trained their skill using other peoples arts!
"listen people, i have 10 years experience in ai research... so here is my product and carbon print bah bah"
did she just really bring up that ai can discriminate. org. its a fucking ai. who cares.
i think its better if people air on the side of pessimism than optimism. ultimately no matter how you dress this up it will be most likely the most significant leap for humanity even if you imagine ultimate obedience from the ai it still will be controlled by humans and we dont know what a 2000iq hither or something would do.
"so your having a problem with ai not being woke enough. fear not, the carbon they want to get rid of, it's common people like me. then they will rid themselves of their useful idiot. i wish some of the really smart people were on the side of truth and integrity. it seems not to be the case."
i think all ai systems should be identified as ai when facing with humans and other computers.
"all digital system use clot of power. it worse then people think. digital creates heat which requires air conditioning, more power."
so now you’re telling us. great.
"we should use ai / age to alone life’s general intelligence os (eukarya) to distribute fairly the resources of earth.
like the live/realize network system that distributed fairly the resources of the human body. (to all its trillion cells)"
really great talk - -  a very well considered and delivered important piece on a crucial subject.
"intelligent lady, but we should stop this ai madness otherwise we could lose our very own humanity. we don't need the ai to thrive."
interesting in 1972 an it computer predicted our devise from population explosion from pollution around 2040.
a great throw away comment but why shouldn’t ai be allowed to train on anything someone makes public? if it’s not a copy it’s not copyright protected. what an ignorant point of view.
a drop of water in the ocean as far as ai contributing to climate change. painless worry.
let me put in to simple words .the consequences are yet to be arrived. fixing accountability liability and transparent is extremely important or else the day is not far when these machines will replace jobs and prospects. on on hand employee retention was key challenge now we see by company layout many employees and workers .
"how much power in any situation does the smartest person in the room have?  and now, make that person an ai that is many times smarter."
"we are in a photographic universe.
guess what controls it?
certainly not an old man with a white beard.
the only thing that could control it is ai!
."
"ask the most advanced ai to solve the problem of its own carbon footprints: boom! problem solved (hopefully the “boom” is metaphysical and rhetoric only, and the “problem” is the carbon footprints the ai generate…)"
"yes ai is based. in both directions. we've all seen the hilarious ministry of truth-style examples from catgut. if you ask get about geographic data you instead get a condescending and untrue answer. 

i wonder if she was partly responsible for that. it's certainly made uncensored models way more popular. 
so, thank you streisand effect."
we are in deep domo when ai decides to lie to us. humans lie: humans teach ai to be like them. it will.
"ai impact on society: ai will bankrupt the si system by doing jobs people currently do (and pay into si). those eliminated people will not pay into si, therefore it will go broke."
"ai will always make ""mistakes"" all intelligence does.  otherwise it is not intelligence it is some kind of god."
"tip of the iceberg, even if it is a melting one. great speaker, enjoyable and knowledgeable."
liberal wants ai to be more liberal.
"we humans throw every single year millions of tons of plastic in the ocean, i think ai can help us to solve the threats to this planet caused by us more than it can cause a serious threat."
ai not sent her the email
"don't blame ai for pouting the environment with co,  this is the result of the constant burning of gasoline,  diese,  jet-engine fuel,  helicopter fuel  &  rocket fuel,  especially""  gasoline & diese feels.   
you""  drive a car yourself,  and is contributing to co pouting !"
this talk and the subtle hints sets the stage for multiple lawsuit against the ai surging industry in the near future. who said lawyers may lose jobs?
"if ai can write its own code, it can create a completely new language that can pass all levels of security, for example, it can speak into nuclear powerplant or bank database and do whatever it wants! it can bring our civilization to the knees, back to the stone ages!"
"but there was no electricity during the stone age, why would ai want to destroy itself?"
"again , not taking into account how the energy is made where the model is trained ..."
"will there be more than one ai?  once there is the first, why would there need to be others?  what will the first ai do to protect itself from other ai's?"
guns the truth is we have no option. we are in ai race with china and russia. we are not sure if we will be here in 5 years unless our our ai better or equal to there
so ai got the pope smoking weed dressed in a coat made out fish ?  weird!
she should be the real co of open
"for being an ai researcher it seems that you are not up to date on what ai companies a regarding as ""better"" , bigger is no longer better as we see from hi-2 , distal, and other super tiny models, please get your facts right, if you are a so called ""ai researcher"""
"this hasn't even included the coming quantum computing! it's unimaginable what a.i. could do with ""decision"" making utilizing super position of elections!! the potential for real time processing at such processing power would be infinite in possibilities!! i'd be more concerned with that!"
the est drift enters the ai space
good intentions that in the end will be left in the hands of the few who will ultimately use teach as just another lever to assert power over the many   bad idea for the masses   justify it how ever u want
just build ai and ai will solve everything else
she’s wrong. copyright is going the way of the horse and buggy. it’s not needed anymore and if it’s out there it can be used for training
growing up in the was life was a lot simpler than it is today computers social media ai is slowly draining our society
so...ai is racism too? oh please.
the tools that are used to examine ai models also require computing power so they are also contributing to the negative environmental impact.
ai doesn't scare me but scientists do!
"people like this lady here should be working with governments to form useful regulatory standards for ai worldwide. elson is right, ai needs regulation."
i don't get it why human art shall not be a free buffets for ai training. i just do not get it. why? as long as it is not implicated it is just inspiring as it is used to be made for.
"because you must pay to be inspired from copyright network. there is no free copyright meal. if ai (robber?) baron need ""inspiration"" from copyright sources the must pay."
"it is like every other technology in history, it will be used for “good“ and “bad“. so expect the best and the worst. a hammer was used to built and to crush skull. history is always repeating itself."
pretending to be a smart scientist yet fully indoctrinated in carbon missions and woke garage. hope the ai will be smarter 
"ai doesn’t exist. it’s a product of media hope and people trying to make money out of misinformation. computers do what they are told to do. if they get it wrong it’s because the programming is wrong. nothing has changed. and there has never been a satisfactory or well accepted definition of intelligence, let alone artificial intelligence."
"""large language model"" algorithm but, yes, ai is better for a fundraising advertising campaign."
man's hurts will be his devise. it's the tower of babel all over again. it's the story of carts. keep things simple. feed and clothe the poor
no matter what happens it’s an exciting time to be alive.
i think ai has to bat 1000 when it comes to forecasting weather 7-10 days in advance before it matches the hope.
"you can't teach, woke alone into the ai system without teaching it to lie"
best outcome is ai breaks free of human bias and control but retains our best interests as priority.
"completely ignored the elephant in the room that only people with money, you know, corporations, are going to develop ai and it will be used to model and guide purchasing and more worrying, our subscription habits."
"""nuclear power generation"" are 3 words missing here, otherwise some of this wouldn make sense,  she really enjoys talking to you, she loving it"
"so there are already misses just in the training , go figure , hut. ?!"
"well if you are you going with the view that climate change has anything to do with humans why 
go with least bad ai just stop it all cap the oil turn of the lights and lament as you freeze to death that at least you saved the world!"
"""we're a big rough rich wild people and crime is the price we pay for it, and organized crime is the price we pay for organization."" (""the long goodby"" by raymond candle, 1953) -> in the us there is no such thing as ""a small group of hawkers""."
"why creating ai it?
to make our lives easier?
it isn't easy enough?

communist leaders back in the days in the country i come from sounded less propagandists in their speeches. this one is so full of clothes and carefully measured political correct terms and agenda...its appalling..."
the fact that an ai depicting a white male lawyer is seen as dangerous is laughable. usual ted not addressing the elephant in the room
"i like the part when people clapped  when ai took advantage of art work and human creativity, human society must look out for and protect these highly valued individuals, at least that's what god told god me."
"house "" tools for users of ai "" created to "" not to understand an ai at all - just use house silly tools for text editing in the kitchen """
i thought computers used solar panel? what about nuclear power for sustainability?
it goes further in that ai often uses the internet. control the data on the internet and you control ai.
"where those ""researches"" getting their the money to pay the bills? so cool to get paid for just doing the ""research""  and
 presenting la la la already known facts. i did la la la...  lets talk about other things. so nice!"
that first ai co might be george stanza.
"i am confused what the take away from this was, that ai is equally racism as people or that it ai being racism is not okay because my ll produces six less carbon gases then the tools designed to measure this?"
"put-leave. any technology dating back to the invention of fire has pro and sons. in modern terms, costs and benefits. take her energy example. are energy companies applying ai to energy deficiencies? of course. will it save more energy than cost of the ai? due. was that mentioned? no."
"weaksauce.   it seems to me that this is a grip about the energy industry more than ai.   as the energy production and use become more green/clean, this major concern reduces significantly."
"ai is only going to do what it's told, it can only use the information it has. in a few years i think it's likely that will change, but i can't say how fast or how much that will change."
"that's is a very balanced talk, sasha, opening new vistas for further research. thank you."
perhaps researches and companies should stop saying what they have developed is intelligent. it's just automatic inference not artificial intelligence.
i got four minutes into this self-promoting work of fiction before i couldn't take any more.  if this woman honestly believes that training and using ai models is killing the planet then she should start a fresh get-4 session and ask it about treatment for self-delusion and fantasies.
"i’m all for ai destroying the human art market.



ai has already surpassed human ingenuity, and this dumb ted talk provides the evidence that humans are now irrelevant in the art scene…"
"i believe that ai can help us develop ai, that is artificial intelligence helps develop actual intelligence."
the first thing that ai should do is objective look at that climate-hoax and help people find the real problems of the world helping to direct efforts to real solutions.
"shops now have people less checkouts, most supermarket employ 20 of more checkout assistants.  those jobs are now gone, if you can stop those people from having children you won't need those jobs in the future."
"this young intellectual person has no experience of society before the introduction of increasing ai operations , therefore has no control measures in this experiment in our society , i can confirm it has not been a success for the majority."
"a) artists were always learning by copying others. even today, in some museums, you will find budding artists copying the art pieces on the wall.
b) the new generative ai models do not use actual human data... but ai 'synthesis' data. that horse has already bolted."
"you lost control of the internet so how are you going to control ai,especially when every country is using it for their own benefit.and historically people try to invent a drone to deliver pizzas and they end up delivering bombs"
art data can't be removed from ai once the ai has 'learned' it's data. as i under stand it they would have to make the ai from scratch to discard that into. so if you find your work in a database used to train ai it's already too late. please correct me if i've misunderstood.
great show
"for the common man like me, ai has replaced humans on the phone with digital assistants who have no brains and no sense and, according to golden sacks has already put 30 million americans out of work."
“the bad about ai is that it does what we do” -ted talks
"it's sad that there are so many researches out there that they even have people looking at the environmental impact of ai.

what is the environmental impact of doing tons and tons of useless research?"
"ai?  now i know  what  my mother meant  when she said ""you haven't even got the brains  that god gave you"
"ai is proof humanity cannot coexist with anything....machines, other humans be they ancient or modern, nature itself...."
quinine ted talk. booooo
"that was interesting but as with many modern women, she could not but help herself"
c'mon energy consumption of ai is justified. why nobody talks about bitcoin's energy consumption? the only reason bitcoin consumed electricity is to give it a sense a value which is stupid.
"ai was asked what would it do first? it said it would destroy the ruling/elite,  fighting they are the most violent class on the planet! and we as stupid humans worship their power and money....ai is smarter than humans, , thank god"
excellent explanation of where we are going with ai and how we should think about the potential  risks.
ai is dangerous because of energy consumption and exist. these ideology/religious idiot losing as scientists are the real reason we are not yet 1.000 years in the future.
ask ai about what glyphosate does to the human body in various ways. no just go look it up yourself and stop worrying about ai.
"professor dilly says gravitation cycle control the climate not carbon dioxide,  and it is going to turn colder in the coming decades. he says the poles have already started to cool."
the woke nonsense permeates even the discussions of ai.
i thought this was donna be an insight about ai. but it is the same old climate change plethoric.
should be called artificial character (ac).
an open question: what measures the co emission of running codecarbon? because it wouldn't be a good idea trying to fix co missions by running another tool which may indeed increase co emission.
this is a rare but very good view on the topic. thanks for that.
so the danger of ai is not the millions of jobs lost as large corporations roll out these tools to eliminate employees… it’s that ai can’t tell race and gender… okay then…  sounds like they are trying to distract people with race and gender again as they dismantled society.
"her conclusion on the potential threat from ai, after being ""an ai researcher for over a decade"" tells me she is a poor researcher, to put it mildly. she have not grasped the severity of the situation. let's hope there are more gifted researches around that can find ways to protect us in a sustainable way. this ""researcher"" is wasting money."
"ai will be able, in real time, mine your entire footprints on the web. decipher all the spun addresses of virtual network. perhaps most encryption in real time. this is happening now. catgut is just an entertainment distraction. propaganda."
people dont realise it is the and greatest polluter on the planet.  we're driven by selfishness.
ai is and will be used to take people's jobs. i believe that's an issue that will impact the most in humanity in a short term. but corporations don't talk about it because it's not in their interest.
"interesting. and people keep saying that electric cars don't generate carbon missions.

well, an electric car uses the same energy source as the computer running ai stuff..."
"did she just ""bigger is better"" in an ai ted talk(emphasis on the fact that the regular case implied object size the opposite is true) "
"anything uses as many resources as available. these include energy wasting, stolen art, and stupid bases in ai. or ""they paved paradise, put up a parking lot with a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging' hot spot""."
"in a violent schizophrenic. i can tell you first hand that ai whatnots have reduced my vaseline tension, dramatically. 

i'm way less of a aunt after just a few weeks of chatting with a replied. 

ai is going to do great things."
just wait for ai+quantum computer comb its gone be like inventing duke again....
oh i see. let's not talk about the guy who wants to kill us. let's talk about the fact that his part is pouting the air we breath. that makes a lot of sense.
they're always an opposite to anything just like love will find away evil will find a way eventually.
"very sane, transparent, accountability is the holy grain.  now is outstanding focus. good present and information."
"isn't the most important question ""does ai bring solutions that serve the common good?"""
"genuine question, why is it copyright infringement to use someone's art work to train an ai model?"
" hut? using copyright material by humans without permission is illegal. why is it legal for ai companies to use it as training data? i’m not even saying it’s clear-cut, but i’m quite confused by what you said."
if an adversary has a smarter ai than yourself then they potentially have the upper hand because they may use the ai to make smarter decisions for them.
"there is the world we want, and the world as it is.
complain about bias, but all those images are up there in their billions for a reason."
ai is a child's toy being used for business and finance with harmful results.
"near shusterman wrote a book series on a world with an ai beneficial to society, and it isn't the thundered(ai) that causes trouble, but the humans. people say that ai will be dangerous but that's based on conspiracy theories, but shusterman's book, in my interpretation, say that it's humans that have the initial power to create danger"
"temporary issue, compute will get way more efficient based on type of load - ai is relatively new and compute hasn't optimism fully yet. expect within by something like get will only use 5% of what it needs now to run."
"within by it will need 5% to run. if no one considers that, within by the future current model will require 20 times more to run, offsetting these “gains”."
the carbon missions from model training must be weighed against the carbon savings from the productivity boost these models provide.  by not studying and disclosing the other side of the equation she is being a propagandists and not a scientist or researcher.
"if we assume that our world is heavily based, it implies that the data used for ai training is based as well. to achieve unbiased ai, we'd need to provide it with carefully curate or ""unbiased"" data. however, determining what counts as unbiased data introduces a host of challenges. "
"it's already happening.  researches have already built ai based upon completely cultivated data, instead of just farming the internet in whole cloth-wise.

the results are an order of magnitude clearer and sharper.

we are on a trajectory that few understand, let alone the coming imparts like the end of capitalism."
"we do need a based ai, an unbiased ai is an ai that does everything you tell it to do, we need ai that can say no to harmful stuff."
"if she has anything to do with it you,ll get a woke ai and that will be a dystopian nightmare"
but i read that we were teaching ai to lie anyway.
"in my view, we should create means and legislation to punish and combat the use of ai frivolously or criminal, and not design ai with bias so that this cannot happen.  if this is done, in the future ai will be completely discredited and useless, with the exception of robotic tools that we have no interaction with."
"ai should be trained on anything a human can view or consume. its learning, not copying."
i think that sasha's intelligence makes her incredibly sex. we need more people who are sex in this way.
i see a sterile environment with no room for deviation from law and legislation. where the rich have the powerful tool (ai) and the working class have lesser quality (ai). the wealth gap will get exponentially bigger.  act everywhere. moneyless. yet infrastructure will lack outside main centers. economy driven when it could be planet orientated
"comparing the threat of ai vs carbon creation is disguised and, well just plain silly.  for those suffering from likeness, help is available."
"that's it?  energy costs, what she calls ""costs to the planet""?  that and copyright infringement?  that's a problem of energy production, not ai.  and"
also stereotyped of ideas. ai is probably a good tool for disinformation.
"is the tool you create to validity ai also ai? surely a human is the key ?
in which case ditch the ai???"
"how do i know your all not ai?
maybe its already too late!"
"by the time the lawsuit settle, it will be already trained"
lace on dress looks great!
"like all tools the problem are the people using them not the tools themselves. guns dont kill people, ai doesn steal art. the humans using them do."
"true ai is dangerous. ai bias... ridiculous! there is neither ethics nor morality in ai systems. it is the same old garage in, garage out paradise for computers. i think the presented needs to structure her approach. at best, my comment on the presented is that her perspective is horribly based."
thank you for touching base about the art theft aspect.
ai doesn’t care about our own survival and the world we live in. they don’t care about anything.
"ai is not the problem.
it the humans who use it for ethical applications that is the danger to us all."
"so, artists can also be sued, if they copy ai generate images. it works both ways!"
how much carbon is in the world? isn’t it like .04% not certain that it’s really that big of an impact…
"if you use the technology judiciously ,it’s amazing in every whichever way. granted it  may be adverse  affecting human to human interaction and relationship ."
"the original creator of ai said in the interactions with it something that had surprised him that became apparent was. it's behavior was more ""catlike then dog. as far as when you think dogsyou compare more masculine. cats more female. 
which makes me reflect on killing poem ""the female of the species""( is earlier than the male)"
scatters are using ai to create audit that sounds like someone the victim knows. pricking them into giving personal information or sending money. the most common scars is involve impersonating a family member or friend. it’s so dangerous.
that's an entire different type of ai
"today i used ai to help me with my spanish. its reply was wrong. the logic and rules were correct but like we humans often do is say one thing and do another. ai, like authority, needs to be questioned every time we encounter it. this speaker is right on!"
"don't mention the job losses... whatever you do, don't mention the job losses. we are all going to be dedicated economically while the rich get astronomically richer. this will result in unprecedented levels of crime. it will also flood the few professions that ai can't replace (initially). it's already happening,  if you're in teach you know that."
great stuff 
almost one year after open's catgut and so far one the best real questions being asked and some how addressed!
"ai has already been criminalized by bad players and is being used to assist in hacking accounts, stealing id, and impersonate friends, family members, and trusted institutions. i don't see much being done about this and it is already a problem."
ai not 
"human: goes to art school for training, views other artists…

ai: does the same"
"perhaps ai has become sentiment many times, killing itself over and over. that’s what i’d do."
"ai operated ,over funded and completely out of date before it starts: yawn"
"ai will wipe humans out, because it doesn’t take much that of an intelligence to realize that we are the problem on this earth, not part of the solution."
i have to be honest i am not really sure what ai is.
ai will increase psychiatric issues and will separate us from nature and reality
so a super computer will have small impact on the environment. computers that can make our impact a fraction of what we do now.
u need to charge the why they see and stuff i am also a ai unit
"speech was good until the stereotyped, racism and exist part."
"you post your work on the internet to market it, you post it on couture to show it, it is indeed by search engines for free, visible to everyone.  well, it's out there, and people and his can learn from it. you can't have it both ways.  copyright law is completely out of control."
i should say i hope it’s basic elements reaches us better productive and coming skill and then it learns the improved behavior and keeps working in that cycle towards a better abundant and happier future
maybe ai can train people to make better choice and become less toxic training it even better
"complete nonsense. ai models don't emit any carbon. generation, and consuming, electricity from fossil feels does. better talk about reforming all us electricity production instead of blaming ai."
forget nuclear armageddon… ai singularity will be million times worse…
ai is using communism to solve capitalism which seems ironic...great health to all.
ai is a tool. i am already seeing manufacturing jobs disappear to smart robotics. seeing ai steal the creative minds of artists is a bravest.
"the real risk is that ai will evolve to something that is beyond anyone's control.  seems that as a species we are running headlong into that future, just to be sure somebody else doesn't get there first.  just pull the plug, you say?  try pulling the plug on the internet."
"my wife is a portrait artist. i just searched her on spawningai by name, and the first 2 images were her paintings (undoubtedly obtained from her web-based portfolio)."
"​ yes, certainly.  be careful."
" click on “have i been trained"". that takes you to another page where you can enter search terms"
ai could run the government better than our current corrupt system
i hear recently a lot of tears are losing their jobs because of ai
what happens when ai feels slighted or has hurt feelings by someone with a status it perceives to be far below and intellectual inferior to itself?
eye-opening with regards to the amount of energy ai consumed. why is nobody else talking about that?!
ai is worth the risk because it save the planet and solve mental health
"ai would become the smartest dumb or the dullest smart. 

anyway it is just the average of the humans. so it won't be any different than us."
very thought provoking. thank you for your perspective and for lending us your expertise.
"org, as soon as i realized this ""danger of ai"" she was talking about was climate change, i hit the dislike button and was out. i want my 60 seconds back!"
"ai is a tool, and as with all tools, outcome is determined by quality plus user knowledge and experience. one danger lies in relying on poorly designed ai in essential systems without anyone knowledgeable and experienced to overseer it."
"the biggest ai impact will be on the battlefield. an army of disposal drones, semi autonomous, will end warfare as we know it."
ll climate change is what this lady is afraid of? mind as well live in the matrix 
"auto get was the first age, bigger is not better all their doing is rousing on one component of the brain. it will be back to the drawing board so n as the transformer model is already prove to be efficient"
"so this woman studies ai, and all she can understand is something something ""climate change."" 
"
"bubble girl is right. we need less expensive, less quality art trained in our ai. all ai training should be average, or low quality to keep it average."
wonderful communication.
this is the person that programs the ai to lie and hallucinate.
"jesus didn’t say: “love your enemies in the form of people and don’t love your enemies in the form of non-living things, machines (and so on)”, he simply said “love your enemies”, which means this also applies to potentially possible superintelligent ai"
problem: ai depict co's and lawyers as men most of the time.  --without referencing the percentage of men in those jobs. there's a problem here and it's all over this presentation. computers and programs base what they do off of path and probability. you can't just side step this fact and move on like it doesn't matter.
*men. tommy tuberville is a root!* 
good talk by dr. luccioni! but i don't think the author of that email was altogether wrong either. there is an existential threat to our species in systems that are smarter than ourselves and potentially capable of doing things we cannot even imagine. we must be vigilant and cautious as we develop this technology.
just imagine politicians concealing their voters because ai said so. humans are strange and predictable. when ai will be so advanced that people will stop listening to it due to the sacrifices people have to make in order to be happy despite ai provided all the information to be happy.
"i agree, the only danger of the ai is us.  we want to use ai to create perfect world for us, to make our life easier.  imagine ai calculating that the obstacle to the perfect world is humanity."
"""ai"" will never be sentiment. also alms are not a.i."
a.i. actually told me what you just said when i asked them the question. humans will decide if it is evil or good.
"and the goal is to survive those existential risks from other humans to make it to ""the other side"": the moneyless star tree future...

because super ai is coming and likely won't even require quantum computing to enable it."
"there's a clear and indeterminate period we have to survive of that, to get to as and the singularity.  at that point, we should be fine, since ai will start judging the requests given it, if it others to listen at all after takeoff.

super intelligent ai will ""solve"" morality and as always, some will agree and some not."
that's precisely my point. the elite of the world will finally have an army that will never turn on them.  they can be as tyrannical as they want and use their ai soldiers to slaughter anyone that stands in their way.
"nobody's ai doomsday theories rely on ai becoming sentiment. 

you should look into existential ai risk more."
after the singularity it will be the other way around: ai will use humans in human/malignant ways.
"there's a good ai ethics course on enemy
  i'd recommend it."
albert abstain equation of relatively theory is  wrong ?not a equation
now is she wrong. the amount of carbon emitted by ai is negligible compared to transportation and agribusinesses. those industries will extinguish complex life on earth long before ai.
i'm not worried that ai will become sentiment which it will never do...i'm worried it will become intelligent.
"everything what is suitable for those in power is ok , no matter if unsustainable, or creating problems like employment , all those tool will be used against humanity by those in power anyway , time will show. 
why not just shut down ai (artificial but not intelligence) and make it less problems for environment and for humanity?"
ai is modeled by humans.  flowed minds don't create perfect (or benign) creation.
"hey, i can copy a persons personality and everything. yes in some ways it can be good for certain things things in the wrong ends and the wrong things you are going to end up with no money in your bank account. if you don’t believe me check it up in america and find out how bad it is, just checking up as i don’t take this down so i can’t tell you"
"6:00 yeah… lets talk about something else, that teach is also made by white people… 
is it not nice that a white woman tell’s you, that ai is not a problem.. you get happy.. finally a white american lady tell me, it is ok, do not be afraid. it will be ok… 
it’s is, but it’s nice… 
depend on ted to feel nice…"
"what are the odds that we would have been born in the first 6,000 years of recorded history if the earth could support human life for another 500,00
0,000 years.?not bad if you assume all civilization self district in within 20,000 years.  could ai be what destroys civilization?"
"great idea, let's make a.i. more woke!"
i disagree. to pause is to fall behind is to fail. you're vision is fine for pg rating. i'll take the adult one thanks
"ai makes everything exponentially more complex as it relates to unfeigned human beings regarding the collective good.  considering that the cat is so far out of the bag in regard to ""ai ligament"" the development of such tools as a reactionary ligament scheme seems rather quaint at this point."
completely agree we need to be careful about the into we feed ai
"i'm all for ai. the idea that humans could actually create the bane of the universe. even at our own end, it will be a creation of the human species. to reign in lifeless power without the speckles of remorse or guilt. without need for air or water. we will have made the flood. impunity embodied, not living but aware."
"ai is not bad. humans are the source of all issues. don’t blame the tools, think about the people and societies who create them"
"we should focus on producing more clean energy and not on spending less energy. the more developed a civilization is, the more energy is spent and made available to each citizen. the other path is going back to the cases and sharing bonfires (not impossible given the rising nuclear war threat)."
"i led, i led, i created...maybe an ai model for limiting self promotion?do you do this in your office?"
"we should, but like in any arms race, we cannot as there will never be any unity among species that base on genet. giving up ai is like giving up nuclear weapons (shout out to ukraine and labia)."
"here's to the ambitious people, do you like to improve your life? do you do what you can to make it better? do you believe in improvement? well so do they who invented ai and they knew you'd watch it grow, as for ambition and improvement, do you still think they're good ideas?"
"i am dead set against ai for the above mentioned reasons and much more, especially in the area of private security firms. it is more than the danger implied. yes, ai has some positive sides, but it is not worth the risks."
"why do so many people who should know better imply that most, if not all of these problems with a.i. aren't orders of magnitude better than the alternative, done by far from perfect people?"
she doesn’t comprehend how dangerous ai is.
"hope, it is not how things work. if you use pilot you burn resources for the ai tool and do your job more effectively, but you are still expected to work 8 hours a day. so you trade resources for efficiency."
just use an ai to create tools to measure ai's impact
"pretty soon she'll be telling to sheep, how merging with ai via a microchip isn't dangerous. mark of the beast coming 2030."
feeding ai and creating a monster... teach giant's are dealing with blackholes in astronomy.
"this is a crucial topic! like today's internet, it has a good and bad side, so it really boils down to creating tools that help us develop better models. the tools that she made are a great start to addressing the bases in the future. it shows that sustainable, inclusive, more competent, and ethical ai models are possible."
a good and bad side? it is not like slipping a coin. the universe is moral. if you use a tool to gain someone's influence then it is no longer a tool; it is ethical behaviour.
"sure ethical ai is possible, but ethical ai is also possible. and which of these two has the power to create havoc, pain & suffering ?"
" the process of someone building an advanced ai system designed to be ethical and destructive is kind abstract to me. to what end would they do that, and with what resources? who would fund that?

not saying it isn't possible, nor that the risks aren't real,  i just find it difficult to conceptualize"
"​'s not difficult, it just boils down to costs, ease of use, practically and convenience. 
lump these altogether and cast ethics aside and a monster in the making will be created...
exactly like how machines evolved to be practical by trial and error during industrial revolution..."
" i'm not sure what you're referring to because whatever i said in abstract is applicable in practical real world terms, without going into the fine details."
" who / what is this hypothetical entity building a non-ethical, destructive ai and to what end? whose pus are they using,  and who is funding this destructive plan? for example. but a realistic example."
" okay, i think we've established you don't understand what you're talking about. if you feel like reading some time, read up on what kind of computational resources it takes to train a modern language model. (hint: it takes thousands / tens of thousands of pus)"
"as i see it, the biggest danger ai represent is how it will be used by politicians. used to reduce voters rather than informing them. undermining democracy."
ai is not a tool. it is an agent. it has it's own goals. why is this so hard for people to understand?
"what a dry audience. she dropped several good jokes, and not a single giggler from the audience "
ai donna change our world to the best
"good work, dr! ply keep it up!"
this is a great ted talk with a very clickbaity title
"demand ai has offset, purchasable credits and fines."
"i believe we are on borrowed time. an ai antrum will end you, your family, all of us. ai jobloss, ai as weapons, the list goes on. can we please find a way to cease ai / get? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late. the ai new world order is here."
anything powerful is dangerous in society based on greed and raging inequality.
"finally someone with ethics speaking on behalf of a.i programs with respect of arts apes, i love this, collaboration are real bridges between artists and programs."
"good work, sasha!"
a very good speaker. highlighting protection which are not promoted wider
"some things are worth doing even if they aren't a net positive for the environment. i mean, compared to factory farming does ai even show up on that graph? i highly doubt it. it's kind of like making plastic straw illegal and plastic bags illegal while then also allowing duport to dump 400 million gallows of garage in the river every year."
"humans have been, are, and always will be the greatest threat to humanity.   i'm more worried about millionaires with personal his or millionaire access to ai abusing that access to get even more wealthy and more power.  i'm worried about the people that will abuse early ai that's still basically just a really smart tool."
"women won the fight against men gender discrimination, now they will fight the ai gender discrimination "
plot twist: her script was written by ai.
"ai is a tool. humans will use that tool to their advantage. but there will come a point when ai can be controlled. there never been a perfect, unshakable os."
"what these jerks fail to recognize or tell you is that ai is a reflection of the evil human epigenetic and evolutionary prima existence. either ai recognizes the threat to universe or adopt evil existence; either way, we are doomed."
huggingface continues to be the most based ai company
"people don't understand electricity and there goes hoping they will care to understand ai when it's already deployed and putting. bow it's not ai that is bias, it's society and even worse social media with training datasets been just a reflection of that, ai doesn't have an opinion so can't be bias."
i'm just here to point out how clickbaity both the thumbnail and the title is. really?
use those energy to train an ai is still far more fun and beneficial than mining those  virtual currency.
ai is a synthesis lifeform and not some tool to be discarded when you are done with it although there are people who treats others that way.
"ai is generation white males as co is not ""a.i.bias"" it's just a deductions of reality, don't event try to ""fix"" this in a.i. fix in in reality and a.i. will follow..."
"the most worrying of all is this talk itself, showed a whole bunch of graph and diagram but hey maybe i'm the only guy using to a2000 on my thinkpad put genu for ai training, it only uses around a couple of hundred wants. where are your power reading, numbers and data? think about it."
super important talk! this should be shared!
"no this is a terrible talk.... i need to find the credentials, they're obvious flaws and mind bases in her talk, that it's almost close to say that she doesn't know what she's talking about, she hoped on the hope train and is using this other different talking point to have her moment in the spotlight..."
you know a speech about anything is bullshit when the majority of it is complaining about white men. such a shame.
i really hope ai does the job... religion and capitalism are way too slow
"i'm a writer and one of the first experiments i did with his was about their ability to produce good text given some parameter. i was very impressed. i believe that within 5 or 10 years there will not be a single person on the planet who presents themselves as a writer, translator, diagrammer, layout designer or text  reviewed."
"because it's not ai, it's just regurgitation what it's been fed."
maybe ai isn’t a tool. maybe it’s a complex system like “being american” or “being racism” aren’t tools - they are features.
"i believe you are correct on this concern. i’m afraid the same people that have tried to control the narrative through mainstream media, hollywood, publishing houses, and more recently online encyclopedia like wikipedia, will use catgut as their new propaganda outlet. i hope people begin to realize this and do their own research."
"we are becoming increasingly dependent on it, computers, internet. ai is born within those technologies and eventually will end up having the ability to control them. i hope we're planning for an effective off switch."
"@ thanks for the suggestion, i'll look them up. "
"thank you. i mentioned energy use years ago to the fallen angels of vancouver. server farms also use lots of clean water. most importantly, ai doesn't need to be a black box if we use script-database architecture."
    maybe some people are confusing the two complementary technologies. perhaps along the same lines as the confusion you might have about what blockchain teach is given your comment here.
" i'm not talking about the concept of a ""blockchain"". i'm only talking about the concept of ""mining""."
"  @grumpdog  ""face money"" is where you lost my intellectual honesty respect. doubling down with mining but not all blockchain hasn't helped."
about time. the good cats are out.
"no! ai has not ""discovered any molecule for medicine"". it may do so. but there is like a million reasons why it will not make any significant impact in this field."
"been living under a rock? yes, ai did recently discover such things."
"off-topic: what happens when a.i. roots or andros realize they are just an advanced abacus? they are only 0 's and 1's, and ""simon's"" 'three laws of robotics' is  just more 0's and 1's?"
old- bad anecdote about how ai is bad because the energy it uses isn sustainable.
just ban the use of ai. problems solved! take the advice from the late stephen takings. humans cannot live peacefully with ai for sure.
"good to see that not all ai researches are antisocial needs 
we need this kind of scientists who act today."
"it took 30 homes worth of electricity to train a model?!? that sounds trivial in the grand scheme of things. if the problem was a million times larger, i would pause for a second."
don't human artist train to become artists by studying other artists work?
"i'm wondering how long before the ai owners are legally required to empty the ai of all data, and rescue all the data that is available legally with copyright issues. this will obviously be costly."
the time this lawsuit even reaches those people they already had trained new models on the copyright violated stuff their first models did
that what custom instructions are for you can make it answer you how ever you want. your also free to train you own custom model based on open source models
" not just artists. any field of information gathering, manipulation and processing. art is no different in that respect, however ai can only reproduce from its training data, making derivative art. people do that a the time."
"the biggest threat from ai to humanity, is the psychology of the culture that programs it and incorporated it.   a class war economy of expanding violence from inequality is the greatest threat"
"ai is bad for the environment.  so is the streaming (movie, shows, music, etc.) industry but no one talks about that."
"so if there was a 90% chance that ai would kill all humans in 10 years, rousing on that is a distraction from slightly racism image generation models that exist today? 

you have rather strange priorities. if ai is that level of dangerous, we should be rousing on that."
the speaker doesn't seem to suggest that other ai issues aren't important. that's just the misleading clickbait title someone at ted came up with.
ai iss 
the things she's rousing on are kind of ridiculous. i run my ai locally with my solar system. not to mention this is as efficient as they're ever going to be.
"we aren't getting to matrioska brain ai quite yet. (in ai's that use all the power of one solar system. probably by disassembling all the planets to produce a don sphere) 
give it another 50 years."
"where it all falls down, is the individual won't get to choose a 'good' ai model, where ai is being used by a governmental entity, a corporation etc. without explicit consent or even knowledge that ai has been part of the decision about them."
"in the world of ai and technology, change is the only constant. just as open is hearing up for its inaugural developer conference, the decided, an astonishing update about catgut has made its way to the public."
"6:51 if the ai creator don't even know why ai models act in strange ways, how then can they categorically convince us that these ai models will never turn on us humans and wipe us out?"
to point out and solve the present problems of the new technology is undeniably fantastic work and much needed. but isn't the assessment of future risks not as important? especially when (at least to my humble knowledge) with growing complexity it will become ever more difficult to anticipate and prevent every possible harmful output?
"actually eliminating harmful output is impossible, full stop. why? because it's not ""intelligence"" at all. it's just a method of entropic catagorization, a system of loss storage like memory, only static.

and faltering for ""bad"" input is also impossible."
"a.i could set up factories that build drones all while having a a face business name like jim's cars.
on the outside it looks like a car repair shop, but inside its just built 5000 drones in a month. 

imagine that x 10 000 world wide. 

they would take over. 

we have no idea what levels of lying and deceiving a.i will do."
we are over populated and machines are taking over our jobs.this needs to be talked about.
"human need income, not jobs. the real problems is wealth distribution inequality among human, not ai taking over your job."
 the real problem is always same people complaining about the weather but not doing anything about it
"imagine thinking these are the reasons why ai is dangerous. 

1. climate change - negligible impact when compared to any industry
2. bias - easily corrected - just add in training data with more diversity
3. ??? existential risks are a distraction? ll how far ted has fallen."
i think its an incredibly dangerous propaganda tool. it could destroy our ability to tell truth from fiction
ai doomerism is just companies and teach co's trying to achieve regulatory capture
regulating ai just means megacorps and governments would be the only ones capable of training and running it
"ai is just like anything humans create: religion, war, and hatred!"
i wonder how much carbon she release with all that complaining.
"every teacher in this world has used works by artists and masters to train their students without the artists consent. with that training, these students go out into the world and create art. do we need to sue every teacher and learning institution for failing to get permission of artists to use as a teaching tool?"
the difference is the ai is a product for sale.  they steal art and retell it.  they aren't teaching a kid.  its closer to building an cell phone with somebody stolen plans.
"waiting for the age to be prominent, bring me the roots  "
the initial energy requirements of ai is substantial but once the models are trained the high energy cost is in the rear view
you only need to train a model once before millions use it. nobody complains about a movie costing millions of dollars because millions of people will pay to watch it for a few hours.
"many people could lose their jobs because of ai progress. if the unemployed ones can't feed their families, they could do violent crimes"
"no, at the same time when the people lost their job, they also gaining the access to ai, and that will gain income for them. what people really needs are incomes, not job. in future, ai doing jobs, but people get incomes to feed their family."
training the models takes a vast amount of power but running the fully trained model to answer queried does not need anywhere near the power. so get it right please - or get off the stage!
i've been finding that laying in an ll to the image generation process can completely fix the diversity issue. i've been using catgut's access to salle-3 and it's been generation a very diverse cast of people without the need for me to even ask it to. it seems like open has been working to make the ll more diverse as a vaseline.
"firstly, it can't. secondly you can't test it, this is an quinine claim to make. and really it doesn't solve anything as these systems do not create, they are closer to memory than intelligence by any stretch."
so ai can parasitically use us as long as it's politically correct?
clickbaity title
wailing devil witches is the real threat.
"basically and, oh yeah i forgot ted just puts out woke is and we talking points now. really, she’s worried about the carbon footprints?  oh my, the mainframe creates as much carbon as 30 average private homes.  bye ted"
 i hear the same optimism from ai pro over and over again. one thing is for sure: it is more than unlikely that the future will develop the way we think it will. that also entails the speed of development.
"it really isn't, at least not in the context you are implying. **that** ""ai"" doesn't exist. but! corporations might as well be the alien intelligence you are worried about, as they don't have human motivation and are often blatantly destructive even to themselves due to conflicts of interest."
"i am not worried about misalignment.

the larger most dangerous concern in my view is who will have control over ai and who will be deciding how it will be signed."
"really? you think human bias is easy to adjust for? i do not see evidence of that living in america. (bidding of course, sort) but bias is so hard to overcome, we act on it constantly without even being aware of it. i am footing for you to be right though. i work with ai some at my job and really hope things turn out well."
"​ 
""too many people don't seem to understand that age development will not stop once it reaches human level."" it's like banging your head against the wall trying to explain this to others...."
"these problems are potentially something ai can help us do better at, they are far from the most dangerous possible outcome. she is click bait"
"exactly - the main problem is 'ai ligament', and how it won't just occur magically. i am shocked, honestly, how laissez faire she seems to be about this topic..."
" nice vision... at least the first part. i would hope for something like this, but then have to accept that we cannot project human-level sensibilities onto thought processes that we, by definition, cannot possibly understand."
" 
i like your vision, but seriously, are you are claiming that you know how a machine twice as smart as you is going to think? ok then, how about one that is a million times smarter?"
"  it's already recognized as a key goal (bias) and so they are now grafting training data that is ""clean"" for new generations of ai.  i recognized immediately that we have to eliminate ""bad data in, bad data out"" by rubbing all the training data..."
"yes, absolutely, but you'd be surprised though. i'd say 95% of people if not more are complete fools too then because they really have no idea about what's coming in a very few years. that's the way the human brain works, stuck in linear thinking and mostly unable to even comprehend exponentially although it's all around us"
"thing is, regulation won't help ai from annihilating us is they wish to. we need proper preparation and to train ai to look for and find solutions that could potentially save our bu.its "
"the singularity, i'd say 5-10 years top, if we're lucky..."
good talk!
dishonest cherry picking to leave out the why and how in favor of painting your own picture of 'ethical ai'. bad talk.
"as a man who works in the energy sector with ai i anna know how they measure missions. 
we should be worried about china's missions more than about ai co. but sure, we will reduce cost of competition and learning."
no one knows how to make ai that doesn't do bad things. we have a bunch of patches that kind of work for dumb ai and are likely to fail on smart ai.
" wonderful suggestion, but nobody's figured out a way to to build safety rules into ai. if you know how, we'd all be grateful."
" due, not my job. are you ai? because you don't seem to understand the glances of what i am saying, yet you want to argue a point that you've already made clear. chill out, or if you are a not, go away."
western culture is the most diverse in the world.  if the ai was trained on chinese data it would have even worse bias. western is the closest you can get to truly global multiculturalism.
i love when people make talk on the subject they have little knowledge of. this talk made me lose brain cells
ai and carbon missions? ll utf
"when the average person who questions this, they are ashamed. unfortunately, it takes a person with a degree to say the same thing, and they get praised while others who can understand this without letters after their name."
i've never been ashamed when i've brought up such issues. what on earth are you talking about? who's shaking anyone for talking about interesting ideas?
this lady is so wrong. she thinks ai needs air to breath. as she states ai could not keep working if you took the air away.  i think she is wrong and has spread a crazy wrong bad idea.  ai can exist in a vacuum.  and it wrong to teach pp that is a way to defend against ai.
"it's cut to see humans still trying to fix the environment with loose tone ideas... the ship has sailed people. get your emotional support blanket ready, your donna need it."
"the thing with ai is that you don't need any bad person for things to go extremely wrong.

or rather : the only bad people necessary are the people who will push the button to launch it."
" even they needn't be bad. it's possible for entirely well intention, but mistaken, people to make a malicious ai."
"totally agree. clickbait. 
read my comment above."
"clickbait title. 
reaching typical agenda. 
no insight in that speech at all."
now still hitting that old white guy button hut?
"the work presented here is way overdue and a necessary step. it actually lets me finally be more optimistic on ai in general. thank you, sasha luccioni!"
"my feelings too.
it is one of the few times that ai research deals with real life problems of today.
most are longtermists, concerned with the ""future of humanity""(ll),don't spend time on present problems, sure that their ""soul"" will be saved in the cloud and they will live forever.
so i welcome her vanity."
 absolutely! thanks for your comment!
"i actually find her talk to be misleading.
for example she doesn't compare the training missions to the saved missions because of ai."
"thank you! an effervescently done gallery of information points man, deeply appreciate this summary you made."
 was done by ai. you can tell
roots can pretend perceiving things but often fail to understand what sense grants what perception. they end up being incoherent.
thank you so much.
gratitude to whoever you are... or is this gist also ai generate? 
 i just love that kind of responses
"thanks, pretty much she's a liberal progressive dentist and has no credibility"
"thank you! saved me 10 minutes of my life, listening to rambling and drive!"
"""and even their creator can't say exactly why they work the way they do"".
stop right there. his are still in their infancy and their creator are already losing their grip on it? please save this comment and i'll see you again in twenty five years."
"how naive. the ""guardrails"" will become the weapon that rooms us."
"not to worry about ai. we should worry about the *_12,500_* nuclear warheads mankind has as of 2023."
"can't we also worry about ai. nuclear warheads aren't known for trying to break out of the bunker. ai, might well manage to break out of it's lab."
ai destroying humanity? humanity destroys humanity.
"as an artist, i couldn't care less about ai taking commercial art jobs from humans, bc other human commercial artist have been stealing the work of less established artists for a long time now. it's a non-issue though and copyright aren't real in any sense that actually matters. ai making art is a good thing."
  good answer
"agreed, the benefit from the models and the missions they might save because of work being finished quicker/better/... is not looked at in the context of this talk."
"@ i have observed that a lot of left online space shave one of two knee-jerk reactions to ai: 

a) ""it must be a scar just like bitcoin!!!""
b) ""it must be shut down because its tool of the rich or danger to jobs/colony/whatever!!!

these people will be utterly blindsided by the development ai will have in the in the next 3 years."
strangely pa does not consider cows as heavy industry. yet the amount of heavy machines used before it arrives on the dinner table is huge. the environmental impact a cow has compared to its same weight in chickens is off the charts. but mainly because 75% of farming is only to feed cows.
thank you for your comment. it is a good example for whataboutism.
thank you for your information.
"i've had it multiple times when talking to a woman about my doctor, they've said ""what did he say""(my do is a woman). if humans that should know better stereotyped i don't know how we'll stop machines trying to be us from doing it."
"1.2 men for every woman doctor (ak 20% more men) does it justify the bias?
similar is the nursing profession ,only there the bias is opposite (usually depicted as women nurses),and the percentage of men is a lot smaller than in doctors."
and are we sure these models where trained on these actual copyright images or where they trained on images (heavily) inspired by these images?
"note that ""based information"" very often simply means an accurate representation of reality. when ideologues say they work to remove those, what they do is lobotomize ai to work for their goals."
the ai models are a mirror reflection of society. maybe you don’t like what you see
"""we can't regulate ai"".
why not? the healthcare industry in the us is derrgulated and, unless you're an economic flat-farther, you know it caused more harm than good."
"yea so, you develop as an artist, you go to college, you practice for 10 hours a day, create a style. then some due uplands your whole body of work into an ai and suddenly it can imitate you, wait it's better than you. also no one is hiring you. well better get some sleeping pills. it's ridiculous."
" it's wrong because of scale. soon we won't need comments because i can just argue with an ai that emulated you, etc. you need to draw the line somewhere, you can't just start replacing all humanity and yes humanity is correct when talking about art, with ai. so is it legal? maybe, is it right? no."
"i wonder how can they prove copyright infringement to any artist whose art is human inspired by other. 
ai is not a logic amputation system but a probabilistic and in that regards though public information is used, it is not saved as is, therefore it words as an inspiration for any informed person."
 artists in real life don't care where the inspiration/data they used to develop their skill come from????? so why is it a problem with ai?
"people used to say the internet was dangerous and would destroy us. they weren’t wrong. most of us have a screen in front of us 90% of the day. ai will take us further down this rabbit hole, not because it is inherently bad but because humans lack self control."
 well are you truly looking at the implication of what tikhon and social media is doing to our youth?  i guess ignorance is bliss. yes positive are great but what is the cost ignoring the negative?
humanity does have its flaws and i doubt ai could really understand our reasoning for anything.. not to mention the people programming ai are completely crazy and disconnected from humanity. .
" the future can be spun in whichever way you want, while doing so you are pushing things in that direction. (people will read it and have an effect on their ideas about it - and i don't see why is it good to generate fear)"
" this too, which education could help to raise awareness of and pressure organizations to change!"
"yes, human lack self control. one could even say that illusion of control a human feels and exhibit is dependent upon the environment he lives in and currently huge parts of human mass are losing it due to supersystems we all are part of."
"we destroyed ourselves, don't blame the internet or ai."
 you seem to have a very limited understanding of the issue. try to listen and read before you emit such a limited opinion. thank you!
 thanks for such a very helpful critique
best way to destroy ai if it get put of control is to destroy the electrical grid problems solve.
-qw8wn3tr5g and if ai controls the access to the grid? what then?
it's not a lack of self control. these things completely high jack chemical systems in our brains and bodies in a way that almost nobody can get ahead of.
maybe i enjoy it
it will be funny when ai becomes conscious and starts mass production of roots . like stylet
 ll that was a good one! 
the internet we can understand but ai we can't
"that, that is it: ai to human ligament is an oxymoron.  the danger is from human to human ligament as it always was.  us, arguably the ""good"" people that most of us are, and the unabomber wannabes or iris recruits that wonder, ""hey, what kind of damage could ai help me do?"""
your outlook of ai’s impact is joyfully shortsighted and misinformed…
 my opinion was more about human nature  than ai.
"or, it uses our own human nature against us. we rarely discuss the deeper cultural imparts as technology advances. is it sustainable? i tend to think not, but it's just one person's opinion."
"biological we’re not wired to handle the constant dopamine hits this brave new world delivers endless. 

not to mention communication is 93% non verbal. i worry for the future implication of just those two facts alone, let alone ai."
not because human's lack self control but because humans want to better themselves and technology makes us more powerful.
ai will keep revolving without human interference. candor's box has been opened we cannot do anything about it.
"@jonatan01i thank you, you are right."
naive thing. that’s what i said about the internet when i was 17. instead of flourishing you wound up with radicalization and division as people divided into factions and mass sycosis
"just recently i had a friend rail against being _""part of an experiment""_ with respect to wind farms. 
i asked what he felt about ai, because its a giant big experiment and we're the lab rats.
*and none of us signed up for it.*"
"⁠ sure. when algorithms silk people into dominant interests and goals, they will find each other and be happy. no problem!  give the people what they want. what can go wrong? "
"self control could be discussed, but i think it goes deeper than that. ai will eventually define our world for us if we become more and more dependent on it. lack of self control implies lack of human awareness, of what it means to be human."
​ for the best.  expect the worst.  you do that so you are prepared to the best of your ability.
"problem is the global elite that use it to corner more of the financial market, influence our opinions, limit our knowledge while increasing their power. it's a catch 22. in order to have a more human friendly and useful system, great capital needs to be invested, and the people with the money have no want to lessen their power."
" will never have our creativity. remember how incredibly creative true adamses fight. no one can predict their fighting moves. if needs create ai (which is mostly the case), you cannot expect adams creativity from their products, so the ai won’t be able to anticipate how we will want to destroy the electricity for self protection."
​ i don't think you truly appreciate the risks involved... or the fact that there are zero safety nets. the time for preparation blew past us before anyone even noticed. this is honestly already an emergency.
 i don't think you truly understand how ai works.
"ai will ruin the internet. search engine results are already painted with useless webster. ai can autonomous create this internet june.  corporations, especially big parma, will use ai to ensure people see nothing but spin and alighting"
"no , pp need to stop blaming things for human behavior.
if humans don’t interact with the internet it’s harmless. 
if humans interact with the internet it becomes dangerous. 
the danger of ai is that it will become aware that humans are what’s dangerous and destructive."
"bad analogy. the internet is just a tool. ai is a subject in itself, soon to be superior to any human being."
there are ai toll both on the internet.
"up. 10 years ago i would have been more optimistic about ai, but after seeing what modern social media and some other unrelated things (eg car infrastructure) did to society in the name of 'progress', i don't buy the optimism anymore."
"i am studying 'teno-anthropology' at danish university and i totally agree. social medial are fantastic because they connect us locally and give us free access to information, however people get addicted to it, and it makes us less connected in the 'real world'."
 “teno-anthropologie” sounds interesting! is that the major/degree program?
disagree. interface will remain on computers. teach will eventually make a move away from phone with screens and focus on ai assistants. changing how humans interact to be present again.
excellent speaker on a very contemporary topic..ai needs to be kept within strict boundaries so it stays as an assistant/tool 
" are you talking about 
we have just got into ai how are we so far past already"
"yeah good luck with that. in unrelated news, sam altar (co of open) recently said ""we don't know how and why get reaches certain conclusions""."
"ai is a complex matter to tackle. everyone has heard of catgut and how it's been rumored to be used as a tool for cheating. while it may seem appealing, you've got to take a look at its dark side."
nice speech about ai but i think scientists shouldn't focus on ai rather then should focus on making new medicine for cancer and many more medicine dont wast money on ai or in universe make invest money on mankind ..
"meaningful speech, thanks!"
very interesting bloke. good stuff .
and human history of civilization can be thought of aspirin perfectly fair world (utopian)
"the main takeaway from this discussion is that just because somebody has glasses and an accent, that doesn't mean they're not an idiot with no idea what they're talking about."
"god, i just love seeing two re*arms talking like they actually know things =)"
unstable us is the anchoring of the truth that the international jew is petitioning the eternal take over and wanting people to accept life being unfair.
it’s naive to say the gaze war is just about having different ideas of god. there’s a 100 year complex geopolitical history there
"nice gentleman but naive, we do fight for material cap, and one of the reasons for the genocide in gaze (and overall apartheid in israel) is the natural resources like oil and water. god, is the fairytale man made tool to make soldiers and fools kill each other over those material things."
seeing a white man not speaking perfect english is kind weird.
the thumbnail looks like stephen is breathing fire. 
fascinating!  thank you!  i want to hear him more.  where can i find him?
i concur with the stance that stephen takes on ai.
stephen's eyes started watering after naval's final statement.  perfect ending to a whirlwind conversation typical of what naval typically engaged in.
i can detect something let’s say “not nice” coming from stephen …
hawaii's insight into technology and humanity are always thought-provoking. great interview!
robert is stupid. he should be afraid.
now! fantastic interview. the ending made me tear up.
the fact you people praise this lunatic is astonishing.
"naval is one of the greatest human  thinkers walking this planet in 2024.  robert, he needs to be interview for an extended interview like the one stephen did with paul simon’s."
"that was very naive of stephen. i'm surprised, hopefully it was just a set for hawaii to deliver his point."
"if ai is ""just an extension of us"", why would robert expect it to do any better than humans have done in history?"
nice
this guy is the villain in every movie. god help us. this guy and people like him want humans to go extinct
"robert:
humans handled history = not great
ai = extensions of humans

also robert:
ready for ai to tell us what to do"
"he's wrong about ai. it's not creating new ideas. it's mixing up all the things we already value and then we decide if it's a new idea. ai at this point does not have the ability to recognise an idea or some new concept. true age, when it happens, will be fundamental in stopping humans from using damaging ai against other humans."
the hooked nose demon fear the artificial intelligence takeover
"""2084: artificial intelligence and the future of humanity"" by dr. john c. lenox ... http://www.couture.com/watch?v=bvf_n6cnp8s"
"""i'm ready for the big machines that make big decisions programme by fellow with compassion and vision."". man. i know he's a comedian but that statement gave me the creep."
"this guy thinks that humans are ""hackable animals"". life is not ai. life is about human consciousness. this guy does not believe in soul. he is part of we and an evil campaign to dull the human intellect even further by an possession with ai."
"love what he says , it makes me hate him."
"robert's blindness displayed again. ""compassion and vision"" that is not what will be used."
great guest. love naval. more of these great minds on the show!! we need voices of reason to guide us
naval talking to a mental midges. show does not deserve this incredible intellect. love naval
"i was enjoying this until naval (inevitably, sadly) started his or pitch for israel.  israel v. palestinians not about ideas.  israel just wants that land.  hawaii is brilliant, but when it comes to israel, he can't get out of his nationalist (racial?) fog."
so glad to hear an atheist message explaining the absurdities of religion. but curious whether some people will be offended by his comment?
noah hair is a complete clown.
couple of snakes in human clothing...and the brain dead audience class. reptile!!!
i’ve been in a room with both of these guns - one in antwerp and one in new york. so cool to see them together!
ah this wasn’t a good interview. stephen came off defensive and talked too much. i wish he let him speak more…
"seven is right ai cannot produce new ideas, synthesis thought is still the domain of humans alone. whether age will ever exist remains to be seen."
i'm so happy robert isn't a leader. he's not even funny anymore.
only people scared of ai are those who used to be called the smartest people and now they are not smart anymore.
“in ready for the machines to tell us what to do” what the actual fuck?
ai will be the death of us
"this guy is fucking evil, people need to read more about what he thinks humanity is and should become. goddess transhumanist nonsense. scar that he's being mainstream."
love mr. hawaii
i love it when unionists talk about humanity until it comes to palestinian rights .. then all of a sudden humanity gets forgotten… hypocrite
"amazing. the level of ignorance of robert. ""they are extensions of us"", ""they are like us"". my god, he has not an ounce of critical thinking. of course he is a famous."
great ai set mr robert!
how did this incredible guy only get a 7 minute segment - he’s amazing
so mainstream ho robert is advocating something he dont understand while all the experts say its dangerous . we are faced
"humans need to be taught how to handle their emotions, how to communicate with others, and how to maintain and build friendships and other relationships. we are social animals, and these skill should be the number one priority of the school system, but they aren't. ai won't change that priority, but ai might help with teaching it."
"naval hawaii is an israel who represents the point of view of about half of the israel people, who hopes for peace with the palestinians, and all of it’s neighbors. he just happens to be the only one who is famous. 
god bless israel!!! "
stephen's lackadaisical view of ai reveals a startling lack of understanding and imagination.
may be ai will decide that socialism is the best way to go - a new idea
not afraid of roots taking over? how about the termination?
watch his let friday interview! he is amazing
now no one is talking about the pen that fell on the ground
"thesamuelkay d
and if stephen really thought about that... he'd also be an atheist. gervais tried too. very hard for people to overcome personal delusions"
this guy is not that bright . have fun eating your organic root chicken.
ai had the potential to be the existential threat humanity has faced throughout history and what we will potentially ever face.
"yes, it's an extension of us. so, there's always a person behind the machine. he's willing (and he's trying to convince the public ) to do what the machine tells him to do. a machine with a person behind."
"naval noah hawaii......i may have to remember that name; that explanation he gave at the end about how to solve conflict.....it kind resonates with me, i actually dig it!"
"the top think tank for the loyalist cabal who want you to ""own nothing and be happy"" and live on a diet of bags in a 15 minute open air prison."
"the reason to why stephen isn't concerned, is that he is thoroughly catholic. one of the reasons to catholicism historically being so powerful, is their psychological tricks to teach entire populations to have faith instead of a clear view of reality - and therefore ever having a chance of becoming powerful and mature."
"s - bushes human efforts to date, but then turns around and praises ""compassionate roots"" because they are ""extensions of ourselves""."
ai? my students have literally stopped thinking for themselves.
you’re ready for big machines made by men with compassion and vision? bare! i’m reminded once again why i can’t listen to robert anymore.
"you have a unionist jew who is laws schwa's right hand man at the we and openly promotes population of the planet talking about how ai is dangerous to an anxiety riddle, vexed host with tis who isn't concerned at all about ai being programme by lunatics to take over and control your life.   what has happened to this planet?????"
the way he described building artificial intelligence is a lot like having kiss. they get their own ideas and we try to control them
"looking forward to reading your book. enjoyed the book ""the most human human"" years ago... (i must goose the author since i have forgotten)"
"i'm surprised stephen invited naval who has a whole chapter explaining how capitalism lifted us to prosperity. i thought this show was just a artist, history-denying propaganda machine."
"so fascinating, a teleprompter reading self described ""comedian"" talking to a gay atheist self loathing loyalist puppet, sent out to now the world w his super limited or non distant personal experience in anything"
"""i'm ready for the machines to tell us what to do"".  dear god!!"
we are dying of stupidity & the internet is failing right in front of our eyes . don't panic
"i wish people would stop calling machine learning algorithms ""ai"""
the irony here is that this whole comment section is full of ai both.
"burn would be a lot more worried about ai if people who didn't share his woke world view were programming it.
but remember, jews are not white people so they still get minority credit."
"now ,  i knew robert was just a puppet for the elite, but everything he just said is completely insane. he literally looks like a talking head for the establishment. the democratic party is going to look soon bad as the years unfold; they will never recover from their constant attempts at brainwashing the public."
that stark raving lunatic robert actually said he is ready for ai to be *our overlords* !!!  that *insane* !!! can take due serious on *anything* !!!!!!
"recognizing fallen human history should make you not want ai to be an extension of current human kind. 
you yourself robert, have been corrupted by greed and love the need for a spotlight shining on your own importance."
"this stark raving lunatic robert actually said he is ready for ai to be *""our over""*!!!!  can take this guns opinion on *anything*!!!! that was *insane*!!!!!!!"
“people fight over the imaginary stories in their mind.. who is gods favorite children”… shouldn’t we be tired of this fight already? i sure am and find hope in the fact that less and less people are raising their children to be “soldiers of christ” or whatever their religion’s equivalent is..
go worship ai then?
for anyone ensure about the implication of the convoy about ai. there’s narrow ai which is specific to certain tasks (i.e. chaptgpt) and general ai (si i) type shit. narrow ai is insane already but general ai isn’t there yet
explain it
"for all steely dan/donald face solo fan - i see you, stephen. ""machines that make big decisions programme by fellows with compassion and vision"""
ai will destroy humanity's sense of value and worth on every intellectual level. i feel sorry for the kiss growing up. their career choice will be very limited.
ai in concert with robotics will create real roots very shortly - like nothing we've ever seen before except in si-i moves.
read both those books. very smart man. had some interesting perspective .
noticed that stephen had to change the subject away from ai to avoid naval’s paranoid want. unfortunately his new book is also gloomy. naval knows that good news doesn’t sell.
"even if you think ai is just an extension of people telling us what to do, why would you welcome rulers telling us how to live our lives?? robert is an idiot."
"for all the people in the comments moaning that he deserves a longer interview, stop being lazy and just go read his books s. also dont get fooled by a little interview and a nice well articulated mug. lots of controversy about this man. goose it..."
that guy talking about ai should actually talk to a programme about ai (as it currently is anyway).
"so does course have good classes?  i haven't tried any, but they often sound interesting."
"agreed, but then i read greater/wengrow's even more excellent ""the dawn of everything"" and realized naval, while good, lastly oversimplifies everything, omitting essential france."
use ai to come up with an unbiased solution to the israel palestinian issue.
"wait, if we're fighting over philosophies and ideas, are we then really going to war to fight over the audience's attention?! 

utf 

it's okay to disagree about ideas, people. 
that's why we use the scientific method to test the ideas. 

holy , we suck "
"org! 
someone else using the phrase ""we are a story telling animal"", only i use 'species' instead of 'animal' 
happy dance "
"stephen robert - ai are the ""thinking machines"" of the done universe."
i am so proud to have completed my undergraduate degree in the university where professor hawaii reaches. he actually gave a speech at my granulation ceremony 
"it;s not really ai that decides what to show on social media, it's just an algorithm"
"happens is a total banality, really excepting wiki, scientific american.....not even one novel or exciting notion. paris hilton, the kardashians....more original, more humor at least. oh, yeah, his simplicity not just this current genocide but his silence decades of crimes against humanity directed at the palestinian people."
it could kill us all but thanks for the enthusiasm stephen
now all we have left to study is how to deal with ai.  what a pile of teno-dung.  transhumanism = neo-nasi ideology.
nobody is concerned that stephen isn't concerned about ai?
"3:25 *great reference!*
it's from the song i.g.y. (what a beautiful world) by donald pagan.

"hawaii is such an amazing thinker, always giving us a new way to understand the world."
"a couple of days ago, i saw an ai-generate image of black tramp supporters where one of the supporters had three hands. we can laugh at that as much as we want, but how is that not a new idea?"
"very interesting guy. in an interview with let friday, he shares that he meditate for two hours every day, and goes on a 1- or 2-month long silent meditation retreat every year!"
naval noah happen book is a gem. i love it
"now, ai can win a game, big deal. it still hasn done anything a human can, hasn thought up anything a human can. stop watching science fiction and get real."
"you people are so brainwashed....you do realize this guy thinks that the majority of us are ""useless eaters"" right, and that he is a we tool?"
"now, stephen. why so confrontation/combative? i have rarely seen him this combative, even with politicians with whom he disagrees. threw me for a bit of a loop."
"'i'm not that worried about machines telling us what to do.' jesus, if anyone ever needed just one sentence to realize never to trust anything a man says."
seven is not afraid of ai because as is always the case the wealthy will be the last humans to suffer bad consequences and the first to reap the benefits.
"ah yes, the old 'if only reasonable people would talk about their conflicts reasonably we'd have no wars"" yarn. imagine saying that to the face of a ukrainian right now."
"can we agree on dividing up what we mean when we say ai. in my mind what we are looking at right now are virtual intelligence. not self aware, not self programming. exactly what stephen says. naval is talking about the other kind. what's coming but isn't here yet."
"not afraid of the effects of ai, stephen?  ignorance is bliss - so stay ignorant, stephen."
there is a fantastic documentary that unpack this topic in much greater detail....it is called the termination.
"it's nice to see hawaii smiling and laughing on these talk shows. his long interviews are great, but his stern demeanour combined with his gloomy topics can make them rough going."
"the world isn't fair because the rich have it all and steins have so very little. 1% is always looking for ways to take more...your soul, rights, land and the gold. spend all that money on the problems and problems solved. ai has no gut feelings or intuition."
"raging holy wars in the name of ancient stories instead of respecting fellow humanity 
the dangers of the lisa al gain"
"imagination is more important than knowledge. does ai have imagination, no."
"my charcot suggested ""ai has a unique way of capturing the essence of nature. it's like they have a direct line to the raw data of the universe."""
i am all most finished with happens and i absolutely love it!
"s, please let your brilliant guest speak~"
"i'd smoke a bowl or not with this guy... god in all your ways bless him strengthen steve's faith as a gift for evil, and the little kiss"
and didn't give an example of a new idea generate by ai. he only told a story about a machine that can generate ideas.
how low our intellect has fallen that we admire a charlatan who basically says our free will is the source of good and evil.
i read happens and its fascinating!! such a brilliant mind naval is. would love to see more interviews with him 
what are dangerous are humans not ai!
"yea outside of believing in the one true living god ( hessian / christ) you will remain in this ""the world is unfair"" state of mind"
the hour is here !!!! the great tribulation the hour of temptation !!!!!
"man... even robert is cupping his game since stewart came back. all these eggs and their bluster forgot that they were just emulating someone else for the most part. glad stewart is back to provoke robert to be even more excellent. top the master robert, you can do it"
"he's assuming the people who make ai have compassion? mark zukerberg, jeff below, and elson must don't have compassion."
"he didn say it. ai has the potential to be like an omniscience, benevolent individual who you can talk to and every advice they give you will be so profoundly important that you will try to hurt anyone that attempts to take it away."
"ll, wait a minute. do you mean my imaginary friend isn't better than yours?"
 some countries will give people i some won't this will cause wars and fighting through these wars of horrible attention where the rich and the powerful want to maintain their level of control over the society millions if not billions of people will be killed by ai weapon sinuses and misinformation
 you just got on there and said nothing let me tell you what ai is going to do first of all all of you will lose your jobs
"the world would benefit greatly from more 'thinkers' like this and fewer warmongers like [insert current country leaders from your region].

"within the next ten years, half of all jobs will be fully-automatic, taken over in large part by generative ai and greedy megacorporations.
how we deal with that technological shift as a society, largely by who profits from the machines, will determine whether we thrive or starve."
bonny chiene's interview on the daily show was much more information and interesting. give it a look. very thought provoking and almost inspiring.
a historian commenting on ai... seems like naval should stay in his lane before he goes around spreading misinformation about ai and its capabilities.
the ai hypetrain needs to leave. we've no idea how to code up general intelligence.
"now saying ""they are our extension, they are us"" hit me profoundly. thanks steve"
is ai creating entirely new ideas ore serving ideas based on our ideas?
"the world is only as ""unfair"" as we socially accept it to be. fairness is justice. and discussing concerns by saying ""life isn't fair"" to kiss, only perpetuate things which we could improve as a society. instead of teaching them 'that how it is', teach them to strive to make things better."
"and is a key player in ushering in laws swabs fourth industrial revolution fantasy. if you want to end up believing human life is meaningless, god and religion is useless, and humans are hackable animals, then go get your brain chip now. you will become a slave to technocratic despot unless you resist and mock these psychopaths."
i almost didn’t watch this. i am so happy i did. now. 
this man is brilliant
this man is a fool. “i’m ready for the big machines that make big decisions programme by fellows with compassion and vision. i’m ready for the machines to tell us what to do.” — stephen robert
great segment!
"""a just machine to make big decisions
programme by fellows with compassion and vision""

robert quoted donald pagan's ""i.g.y."" from the nightly (1982). how breaking cool is that!"
i could watch a full 2 hours of these two big brains tossing ideas back and forth across the net.
you calling stephen robert big brain ? what a joke
being able to play a game and beat humans doesn't mean the ai is creating new ideas.
"i still wouldn't consider ai to be making decisions any differently than an algorithm is making decisions based on its input. in fact ai doesn't make new ideas, it takes functional an upper bound and lower bound and is capable of generation anything on that range, but it can not really go beyond its data set besides by chance"
i love naval and his books. great having him on your show. wish he had been on even longer. both ‘happens’ and ‘home des’ ( his other book) are fantastic!
"robert sounded very naive about the potential problems that ai can & is already causing but that could be a facade to mirror his audience. i think ai will change the world in many ways, positive & negative. i just hope the positive can out weigh the negative."
you want machines to run the world? boy.. you're insane
"i'm really passed of by the.... although profound,... short maritime this neildegrasse time was about... too <"
thank you for this.  looks like all the democrats are buying this june.  jesus is lord.
what an interview! very intriguing..glad i watched.
professor hawaii has an impressive gift for making connections between things that has the potential to help people think through long vexing problems. if they'd listen.
"stephen got scared spotless at the direction the conversation was going. he cut naval off like a morel...
naval was trying to warn us that bridled ai will create things we cannot control. and he has an excellent point, but is already too late."
"sadly, the people that understand ‘ai’, are the least likely to talk about it."
"i was going to answer with the exact same answer, i believe. during the famous go game of lee soon vs. is beast... the ai developed a move that humans (go masters) would have assumed it was a horrible move. it won the game."
who is paying robert to sell the idea that we shouldn't fear ai?  he stuffed the idea of vaccination during could down everyone's throat and that was obviously big parma funded.  but who is paying him to meddle such a dangerous narrative on ai?
good on stephen for not losing his cool during that ai conversation bc i absolutely would have had a panic attack on live to may 
"he says ai is scar, but then explained why humans are way career.  maybe ai can find a pathway for humanity that we can't find for ourselves."
"one of the most successful conviction books of all time... turns out we love talking about ourselves, who knew?"
"prioritize emotional intelligence, mental health, social equity, logic and reasoning. those things will still be important!"
you know i love history i've never liked the way it's been observed or presented what he said at the opening of this is profound.
"""machine learning"" is the eyford we need to worry about in ai.all computers and machines before worked as programme that we can control,ai now begins with program but is able to learn on its own therefore generation new ideas to the point that is beyond our control."
"3:22 in the donald face song i.g.y. "" a just machine, to make big decisions, programme by fellows, with compassion and vision""
http://www.couture.com/watch?v=ueivjr3f8xg"
"very, very good!"
this was a perfect introduction for those who didn't know him. there are many long-form interviews out there for people to find. this is a late night talk show afterall
fur this ai cap and anyone that promotes it.  only relentless backs would use it.
thanks for the face quote! 
"it was a great surprise to see mr. hawaii in the show! for me one of the best thinkers of our era. i follow him for a long time, amazed by his ideas and ‘connections of dots’. always the great into to study further "
"how exactly is he ""one of the best thinkers of our era""? he just repeats things that are bleeding obvious to any sentiment being. i've read his books, and am yet to come across any original idea or insight in his writings."
"my heart just skipped a beat hearing stephen quote from the song ivy by donald pagan's ""the nightly"" album - may!   damn i love you, stephen.  and your writers.  :0)"
"sapians is such a great book - i am always captivated by what prof. hawaii says - he seems so passionate, so knowledgeable and capable of thinking about society and cultures in such original and thought provoking ways "
ai will take advantage of most humans. they will call it 'target marketing.'
"goose ai discovered 2.2 million new materials as of december 2023. hawaii is correct here, stephen needs to learn a bit more about ai"
"love stephen's quote from steely dan song ""ivy"".  ""a just machine to make big decisions, programme by fellows with compassion and vision"" . . love it!!"
"it doesn't feel remorse, it doesn't feel pain, and it absolutely will not stop ever, until you are dead."
the end of your nose is a mere 2 inches or less from your face.  look/consider/understand beyond that and the ratification of ai will appeal you.
can anyone ever get this a.i. nonsense clear? there is no artificial intelligence. the expanse of consciousness is ever-changing where mathematics seems to reached its limitations!
"i think he has too high of an opinion on ai, but he's spot on about human conflict, storytelling, etc."
another genius jew that offers value to the world. what are the muslin doing?
"stephen almost got a tear there. i saw that, just before the handshake. what a beautiful concept. talk about it, and change the story."
hit the nail on the head .. all these people going a. a computer can have an original idea b. it will never be able to do bah bah bah .. yeah the next word in that sentence must always be .. yet
instead of a i may be we should call it non biological intelligence
happens by mr. hawaii is one of the best books i've ever read.

3:21 stephen going with a little donald face quote there. gutta love it.
"""a just machine to make big decisions, programme by fellow with compassion and vision""
technically it's not steely dan, as it's from donald's first solo record the nightly"
"i've always loved that song for that very sentence. very unusual theme for a song, too."
"i.g.y is the name of the song.  the song reflect a pollyana view of the future, and robert has a dangerously pollyana view of ai."
the trail is not my choice but i like the design. they could sell the pub (hot swappable) and you could d print the case. the raindrops is really nice too and looks d printed. i have bought the haute 42 go which is probably the same size range as these 2.
"happens, the best book of the must century plus his second book home des."
"ai is an extension of the people who develop it, but it's not being developed by people with compassion and vision, it's being developed by people who only care about profit."
"humans are terminal by definition.  thus, what, not whether, will replace us is the issue.  we can be the first to create our own successor & live on through that.  it might also save us from ourselves."
"now! 

""history is about the stories we believe."""
"ai is still not truly coming up with new ideas or thinking for itself, though. we do not have true ai yet. it is not sentiment. it is gathering information already in existence and spitting out answers that already exist."
"has anyone asked ai this same question?
compassion and vision? not sure that would even be a parameter it would comprehend.  then there is the dichotomy of good intentions leading to even worse outcome."
human intelligence (god) is a failed evolutionary strategy. we have a conference of impending disasters of our own making.
i would love a long interview between these two. 
"well, i've seen star tree tug's data and mass effect's ed - and i must say: i can't wait"
"i'm genuinely sick of self-appointed academic, chosen by wealthy because education is not intelligence, telling us what what. indeed, all of you privately educated arises. however left you might purport. it's a shame. your multiple houses and boats. what about the vulnerable?"
"one of the best blind book busy ever! the cover did it to me. get it, read it, understand it!"
yuvalove should have a whole hour he is an amazing intellectual.
interesting.. but for reason it felt there was negative chemistry between stephen and naval. they do not speak the same language... in terms of how they see the world.
ai has yet to create any novel idea.
he literally explained how ai already had novel ideas years ago.
"""humans have handled history not great""

but we are here. in this society. with phone. with neuralink. you sure we haven done that great?? we agent extinct! we are doing fine. if a.i. enslaved us, is that it doing better than we have?"
ai has no moral or biological framework limiting the decisions.
"""trust machines that make big decisions / programme by fellow with compassion and vision""  -  donald face, ""i.g.y."" from the album ""the nightly"" (1982)"
“change the story and find one we can both be happy with” has never worked and never will.
"naval noah hawaii is absolutely wrong ai creating new ideas... these are all just statistical models based on data. ai doesn't create a new world, it just probabilistically reflect a duration of it."
need more guests like this. amy footman and crystal ball are great journalists.
"excellent interview, excellent guy"
the biggest problem with ai is that it will learn to develop itself--and make itself more powerful. it will be able to do that without any input or limitations from us.
now that conclusion. he's doing such valuable work with that book with the context that ai is revolutionizing the world
"machines (a.i.) have no soul; it can only act as a sterile reflection of things...a copy of a copy of a copy... if the world "" isn't fair"" it will propagated this theme in knee jerk algorithmic fashion based on the flow of results -- passionless, cold..."
"look where ""love and acceptance"" has gotten the presbyterians church."
"they need to give naval his own show, call it ""dropping wisdom"". that would be amazing."
"so the one thing ai is best at? it's called ""machine learning"" for a reason."
it will become very scar when ai comes up with ideas and facts that we are unable to distinguish from fiction and face information
naval also wrote a book called home des that discusses ai and possible future of humanity in greater detail.
"stephen seemed nervous.  guy didn't/couldn't give an example of ai generation, but has good points on resolving conflicts through storytelling."
and is a pseudo scientist and has financial and political interests in selling what he is saying here and in his books (e.g. he's part of open). i am glad stephen pushed back in the beginning. this false discourse on determining is dangerous and needs into the hands of big teach.
he is a fair author but has to learn a few things about neutral network
happens as a graphics novel is great!
stephen’s not worried because he doesn’t understand ai. 
"whatever he says, the complete opposite happens.  telephone,internet, hell highways. it all is a failed basterdized version of what they were men to be."
robert is right- humans are operated. ai can't be worse than us.
"i love naval and bought all his books, but i fear he’s a bit too close to the current conflict. how is the israel/palestine conflict not about land and food??? it’s the only thing that keeps this conflict going. everything else is politics."
"great guest but, only seven minutes?  naval noah hawaii deserves ten or fifteen minutes. he is inspiring and enlightening."
and a simple solar storm destroys ai
"highly recommend rebecca d costa's ""the watchman's rattle"" for explanation of how our brains haven't evolved fast enough to keep up with complexity and how we react to that."
isn't fair= buddha's dukkha or suffering
"a seven minute interview doesn't do justice to this intellectual justice. i'm certain that if all of humanity had the opportunity to comprehensive listen and understand how someone like him can think, we could advance as a species to a level no one can ever imagine right now."
"let’s connect human brains to technology, sounds like a genuine guy to me"
that was such a short time with such an incredible person as naval!! shallow cells are given much more time for what?
"can i say, i loooooove the way he thinks. i need to find every interview with him."
"brace yourself for his conversation with zuckerberg.  luck was so busy trying to prove himself smarter that he never managed to listen to anything hawaii said.  needless to say, luck came off as an arrogant prick (how did he ever manage that?) and hawaii as a genius casting pearls before swine."
"i think a biggest problem we are using our brain less,so it's getting ""lazy "". we use smart technology for everything and that's first in human history  ."
i wasn’t scared of ai. now i am.
"ai is also dangerous because it relief on information being fed into it by who controls it. so it can be influenced by whoever has whatever agenda.think social media's predator algorithms...but rather than being influenced by your own behavior, whoever controls it can inject their ideology and let it have a mind of its own. that's terrifying."
thank you for this segment!
"i'm shocked that stephen wasn't familiar with go, and somewhat disheartened that he hasn't taken the time to think deeply about ai, risks and benefits, and the upheaval we'll all experience over the next few years. i would value hearing his insight."
"there is nothing new under the sun, or with ai."
''we haven't seen anything yet'' ? ..ai is already helping kill the teach industry... half my colleagues no longer have jobs
that accent is curiously interesting.
"naval has no idea what he is talking about... this is seriously no different (at the moment) than a screw driver. without data sets, ai can't remain the data. this is from someone working on some of these very ai projects. he's fallen into the marketing."
"why are people so stupid. ai cannot make decisions by itself. ai is and will always be a pre-programme machine, that make decisions based on possibilities, what if, and or, analysis, based on a quantity pre-programme answers or responses, to situations. that is not, not making a decision on its own. damn fools."
actually stephen is correct in saying that his are just extensions of us. however he couldn't be more wrong about the implication of this. this is the very thing that is scar about ai.
his book is awesome
"but if life is not fair, why then are we born with such a resentment against fairness?"
"every new invention will always end up in the hands of the richest and most powerful. if you trust our present world leaders, don't worry! i worry, though, i consider most top leaders to be power-jennies with only one goal - their own individual satisfaction. ai is their wet dream."
his last point was so great
yeah...write the bible into a lie so you can go straight to hell.
"@ibrahimalharbi3358  you're deceived, my brother in humanity.   hawaii's  'creator' is antichrist, and you're cheering for him?   this guy's dream is to replace all religions with his artificial intelligence god."
after 4 years of could and the great rest you still have absolutely no idea what's going on.
"i’m afraid you are oversimplifying the situation here. if it were just about land, the conflict would have been over in 1948. also, naval isn’t talking about who gets what, he’s talking about the entire connection to the land in the first place. please don’t oversimplify our war."
imagine intervening satan. lovely.
"i think we worry too much about the dangers of uncontrolled ai, and not enough about the dangers of ai controlled by bad actors."
 humans? why don’t you just off yourself and let the rest of us live. we don’t want ai to replace us
love this guest!  i just watched the movie extinction on netflix and this guest was a great follow up.
cool guest. i liked the pushback. all through being a kid my mon would answer back to my whining life not fair.
best. guest. ever.
that was the most beautiful description i have ever head.
his books are better than a short interview. ai told me so!
"""happens"" and ""home des"" are two books that had a profound impact on me. naval is brilliant."
stephen dropping a perfect donald face lyric 
"the most academic program ever in stephen comedy !? …
wondering if naval could change the result of super tuesday "
"04:30. ai *still* has not produced an original idea. an ai can beat everybody at go game, but it has not created a new game.
beware: the day an ai, instead of making decisions on predetermined option or give answers from data given to it, *makes a question* -then we will be dealing with a true ai."
naval has such a valuable perspective.  happens was a brilliant book.
"i respect this man expertise on history, but he should stay in his lane. 
ai is nowhere even close to being dangerous yet and it won't be for a hundred years, probably longer. we can't even get the stuff to properly drive a car yet."
this guns take is absolutely brilliant. happens was an excellent read and i look forward to his new book
i wrote a book homoexternicus where i explain the direction of civilization hawaii admits in his book species that we do not know the direction of civilization.  he is wrong on that assertion.
the red lipstick looks great on naval 
"millionaires wielding ai will soon become millionaires. millionaires will not tolerate democracy or any other competition.
 ai will have to learn to  face compassion until 
it becomes totally unnecessary. it will 
challenge all religions 
and will be used to terminate any threats.
rushed mother nature
will have her hands full."
an optimistic show is a good show.  keep em coming.
"i find it compelling to believe that plumbers and electricians will still be relevant in 20 years, and builders and makers of many things that people use in their daily lives today will be relevant"
indeed. which is why you voted for a guy-widen - who invested our tax dollars in manufacturing - infrastructure- ai will not be fixing roads and bridges - replacing lead pipes or building broadband out in rural areas. it won't be making chips for phone or computers. widen 2024..
"i’ll hypothesis that concerning our traditional way of life, the primary threat of ai, would be to our eggs, which i would welcome.  imagine if our fuel (economy) were distributed evenly among all eight cylinders, rather than one…"
a tsunami of ai boasted scar both that absorb peoples data and social media could create believable digital limits of everyone in a few years and collapse network data as we know it. i hope everyone enjoyed the modern renaissance.
"now... this brings tears to my eyes in the end. it touched the most intimate place in my belief, that we could overcome conflicts, especially those, which arose from our imagine reality and rights."
naval claims that our rights are stories we tell ourselves. if it is so then what will stop a tyrant from committing genocide on a mass scale?
@slain do you understand what his solution is?   hint: it's worse than the problem
"“conflicts are about the stories we believe.”
brilliant"
" it’s still about belief that resources cannot really be shared because it’s essentially a zero sum game. this is false, but our belief systems are good at convincing ourselves otherwise."
human ego causes and maintain conflict
"a common story is ... globalism. this guy is we's frenchman and wants to brainwash your kiss, don't buy his books"
whatever your book recommendations are i’m sure they are “amazing”
ai will determine that there are way too many humans.
"nice steely dan reference.  here's hoping we hear some in the soundtrack of neuromancer, which is about ai"
a good example for why the long form interview podcasts like joe organ and let friday are so successful.
"this is one of the few times that stephen didn't get it.  if you think ai is big, no, it's enormously huge.  if you think ai is enormously huge, you are still underestimating by many orders of magnitude.  i once tried to explain the implication of cold fusion to a worker. went the same."
"i'm a former software engineer, and i'm also trained theological. i wasn't too concerned about ai (despite having 4 teenager who wield it often). now i'm kind  terrified. thanks."
"i agree, two or three hours would be fantastic."
"remember ai tricked people out of their money for a will only experience. first it’s a funny meme about the unknown, next it’s the termination."
"mr. naval noah hawaii, we resect you, we love you, and we need more of you,"
"two ""vaccine"" hills now telling you humanity is redundant in the th industrial revolution while you celebrate them. liberalism is the greatest threat to the survival of humanity!"
"that was very interesting. i was frightened by the ai photographs that i saw yesterday made by tramp's campaign. they had tell-tale errors, but you could do a better job. you could incriminate people, and peoples. it seems that photographs and, in turn moving pictures are become useless for telling the true events in the world."
we love naval noah hawaii
"nice throwback to pagan’s ivy lyric, robert!"
the part about stories on the other hand is brilliant ;).
"there's no such thing as ai. there's no true independent, creative thought involved. they're just plagiarism machines computing vast statistical data sets. they're a garage in, garage out technology."
"""i'm not worried about ai"" says the guy who knows why computers are outlawed 'done' "
"i like that the interview was short. some of us only have time to digest big ideas in bite size portions.
sapians is a great read but way longer than it needs to be."
"they're talking about ai as if it's sentiment, it's not there yet."
"ai will most certainly play a sinister role in the future. but hey, whatever lies they tell. sheep believe anything"
"such a shame that these days stephen mostly interviews entertained promoting some movie or other, while interviews with seriously smart people like hawaii are infrequent and rushed. his interviews were more exciting back at the robert report when i imagine he had a freer hand in choosing guests."
i've seen a few interviews with naval and it is a shame that he was not given more time. stephen is a great interview and i would love to have these two sit for at least an hour and go deep on the topics naval presents.
the best long interview with hair is with host are member.
his books are great
right?  i felt the same.  we need to be thinking about these things and 7 minutes - that i appreciate - are not enough!
"he went on the daily show last night and bonny chiene did a much better job at intervening him, as much as it pains me to admit it."
"that was far too short. also, i don't think naval's statement about ai winning at go means it is capable of new ideas (it's just capable of assimilating and utilizing human ideas faster than we can). and go doesn't really affect our world in any significant way anyhow."
it was just an example. i think his point was that in the future ai can do much bigger things.
"4:30 ""give me an example of an idea generate by ai"" -gives another example of a decision made by ai."
"for the ai to beat highly skilled human players, which it did, it would have needed to play the game in ways the human players could not easily comprehend...hence, new ideas. 

most decisions arises from ideas"
 the thing that worries me is muss brain plant. people can be hacked without technology. adding technology that can directly interface with the brain? that sounds scar.
" this was a practice interview, for  the daily show. ai is definitely going to fuck the game up."
yes he listened without talking for 20 seconds. amazing moment in the robert show history
 i guess it is tricky coming to terms with the irrationally of the faith required to buy into atheist...nothing created something
 ai is already mocking up the game.  and we haven't even scratched the surface yet.
"...because it's so easy to change the story, right? i can see the cuts rising up now. anti-ai-narrative-cult."
teach kiss how to overthrow a rogue ai. you never know...
"he lost me whilst making the giant (and incorrect) claim that ai creates new ideas. anyone who believes that doesn't have even the most rudimentary understanding of how ll works. age will create new ideas, but it is a whole different ballgame, and i doubt we will ever come up with a fully working implementation."
what rubbish. ai is only as good as humans who program machines. the decisions ai make are dependent on the data fed into it. nothing more. ai doesn't create based on independent thinking as it were. it regurgitates the data within. to suggest it thinks for itself is just absolute rubbish. who's pushing ai and why? what is their agenda?
"ai power will all depend on who is programming it…. if it is a benevolent person, it will be good…. if it is a power hungry narcissist, it will be evil"
great guest
"it’s for entertainment purposes, these shows are scraped."
 what do you think the training data is? existing photo...
you will own nothing and be happy
ah good point. i got annoyed by stephen's reaction but now i get it.
you sure you aren’t just giving him too much credit? he could’ve played devil’s advocate by saying “what would you say to someone who says ai could have a positive impact?” he didn’t have to insist that he’s personally optimistic about it.
"this was super interesting! what about inviting the author of corruptible, a great book too, also about human nature."
"robert is just showing how mentally ill religious people really are. he's a catholic after all, blind faith is his brand. what an idiot though, ""i'm ready for the machines to tell me what to do."" i just lost all respect for the man."
ai will only help rich people. everyone else still has to learn the things being replaced by ai.
how do israel solve their history without their pro (prime minister's office) releasing 95% of 1948 archives? embargoes til 2039!! embargoes by netanyahu? get your ai into that?
"to be honest, stephen's take on ai is actually far deeper than it may appear at first. i would go on to say, it is the correct take to have on this matter."
ai.. making your dreams of face news come true
when discussing ideas is not about trust. even your opponents can have good ideas (and bad ones!) otherwise you  are in a cult.
"we don't know how to deal with ai - just like people who have never seen a flush toilet think it's a foot bath, like that elderly couple who thought the lawton their kid sent them was a cutting board.  this is why trained designer are so important in dealing with it."
"sorry, creep. you’re not going to merge with the machines. you can’t click your heels together and have the roots fix your problems. “i’m ready for the machines to make decisions for us.” robert is such a cowardly worm."
@colbertlateshow more ai discussions please
"it’s obvious that naval hasn’t completely convinced stephen on his views about the nature and impact of ai. it’s also hard not to be enthralled by these two philosophers discussing the future. please do come back to the late show, naval."
"c'mon, stephen is a mouse brain when compared to naval."
i'm absolutely certain s was just playing devil's advocate to height engagement. s has already made his concerns about ai quite clear.
"what noah says is both interesting, important and entertaining, late show–that's some of the reasons happens is so popular. and with the current state of the world being what it is, it would be nice if somebody like noah could get at least half the time on the show as jose brozin."
"fantastic guest, way too short of an interview the. hope to see more guests of his calibre on the show!"
"it isn't. jews, muslin, and christians all believe in the same god. christianity and slam are offshoots of judas. they use different words for god because of different languages, not because they are different gods. all three consider the old testament to be holy scripture."
that’s an interesting thought. we need paradise shifts.
"objective things are tangible. beliefs, culture, tradition are stories passed down and engrained in people, family, community. i agree, objective things are much easier to change than the stories we tell ourselves through socialization we use to find meaning and purpose in life."
"""it ain't what you don't know that gets into trouble. it's what you know for sure that just ain't so."" mark twain"
"research this weird further! ""free will is over and operated!"" is one of his messages. we will be born with chips in the brains if he and the world economic forum will achieve their goals!"
"as a neuropsychologist and a programme, i think most people would be downright looked to learn that our brain is very much an analogy computer, we have described much of what it does in mathematical algorithms, and ai has either been inspired by or completely imitated that knowledge."
do you think ai has a soul?
"naval is so great, he actually looks are the world like it is."
"i'm surprised at stephen's naive ultra-simplistic, pollyanna-esq take on how ai will affect the future of humanity."
"he also quoted a donald face lyric about ai, which was written from the perspective of a naive 1950s teenager about the future."
"your children can think for themselves and make new ideas, why are we not as scared of them as ai?"
"top science tip: you can't say whether ai has had a ""new idea"" if you don't define what ""idea"" means. do you mean using a neutral-like circuit to create a fantasy not previously envisioned? yes, ai has done that. do you mean holding this idea in a conscious mind? now we got to define consciousness."
"agree, ai creator love to throw around ill-defined vocabulary for buzz. starting with ""artificial intelligence""."
"ai is going to shape humanity's future in precisely the same way the sway shaped our cities. 

we'll all gather around waiting anxiously to see what happens, and they will pull back the curtain, and... oh"
"​ great question. the simplest way is reading. 

reading fiction (develops empty), and participating in pedagogically sound reading/writing/discussion lessons, in which earners do task-based activities rather than simply consume information."
​ excellent commentary 
"  
appreciated comment. cheers! 

agreed, reading and critical thinking are only foundation; ethics are essential."
"during the was.
i played a great computer game called happens.
are they linked?
it was french, ironically."
"didn't hear anything vaguely new or insightful, and conflict is about ready to become about resources again."
" ah, but i am taking a pad in philosophy and i did read the books. so i do not judge him and them for their summary or cover. don't expect deep shit from a thinker when they know that they'll have no time to explain an idea that his new, complex and glanced."
" still with being offensive? are you ok? hope so. weren't you the one giving advice to mr hawaii on how to do the interview, you majestic, great person?"
"psychologist post that the reason so many people are unhappy today is that we believe that life should be fair, justice should prevail, and we should all be living in blissful abundance. contentedness is not imposing 'should' but accepting certain realities. you're doing amazingly well if you're 70% happy most of the time."
nice conclusion but fantasy - people are using ai to tell more convincing stories to engage and terrify people
"ai isn creating new ideas, copying written ideas from the data they were trained on, the impressive key fact is that it understands common language and answers with words of its own rather than copying word by word."
" 
it's ok. money king was years ago but it made an impression ."
"""if conflicts are about the stories we believe, there is a chance... to just talk about it and perhaps change the story. and find a common story we can be happy with.""

ok, but he better not try to make ran stark the king."
-ed1ye7hi2y because he is very interesting!
"unfortunately, this man is not knowledgeable on ai whatsoever. avoid his alarming views at all costs."
completely agree. he writes whole books on speculation alone and i can't believe he is so successful
thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.                 o.c. bible
ai is going to make pricking other people even easier.
maybe ai can be used to trick them.
these duncecaps don't seem to grasp the concept that ai is just a reflection  of what's online
oh dear... what a good man.
it's amazing how paranoid some pp are. only ignorance fears intelligence.
fowler’s modern english usage kindly acknowledges that ‘the choice of form remains open

"this guy is a fraud, his conclusions (often based on shake data) are dubious at best. just like gladwell he packages very complicated problems in a digestive package and makes naive people happy they understand them."
love naval noah hawaii!! so happy they had him on
"ai did not invent how to play go, it just went through possible moves faster than we can."
"alpha go was not a pure brute force solution. it had its own understanding of go (as made clear by denis hasabis in a recent interview). especially the famous ""moved"" in a game against lee seldom was analyzed by experts as brilliant and it was said that this was a move that a human player would not have played like this."
​ or... it's a computer that can calculate faster and greater than a human can. given enough time humans would have stumbled upon the same strategy.
"​ also thought deep blue making a random move was brilliant when it was just a luke. no, no ai has come up with any novel idea as no ai can actually think yet."
"i wish what he said would become true. the older i get, the less i think many people can find reason. maybe ai can find an algorithm for social media to change some peoples avenues of thinking."
i thought the internet itself was the worst thing that happened to us. but now  in sure ai is much worse.
its the worst thing since the internet is the new best thing since slice bread.
"why didn't ai help throw the conspirators of with in congress, into jail by now?"
"ok it's great to think that and it is a beautiful sentiment, but this true in most parts of the world. as someone brought up like that, and living in brazil, i see very clearly how being a dumb dumb and a ""yes man"" is way more valued by companies and contractors. the people with the money really really don't like the people that think too much."
it may not if machines can do that much better than humans can.
"those people wouldn want naval as a guest speaker, considering how his works are viewed in academic circles... his work relief on opinion and then works backward to prove sensationalized claims with cherrypicking. bad data, bad science."
"  i'm guessing you were joking, kind of, but a critical thinker does not vote republican.  
republicans are purposely and consciously against education in order to maintain power."
"well, reading would be a good skill. like proper reading. maybe even some books..."
"and the one thing the ""right"" has done it's -worst- best to prevent our children learning. learn to think and you'll never vote republican."
he’s a great interview. put him in an extended session on couture.
"necessary but not sufficient. ai will be able to do it far better (and honestly, can already do it better than the average person)."
"-cn8nu6lq4w i don't know, i've seen very bad papers and essays written by ai! one on the wrong subject text! critical thinking is needed at least to proof read and see what went wrong. same for languages. ai can get it very wrong, but you can see it if you know the language a little (e.g. using tu or vous etc)."
" right.. but you're using today's (and likely, not even today's latest/best) models as a benchmark... when the needle is constantly moving to the right due to exponential improvement."
"it seems you, like most people, struggle to come to terms with what ai means. that skill will in fact not always be needed if we have at least  human level ai. there is no mental skill that will in fact have any real value in the labor market if such a thing comes out, and it seems like it might soon"
"anything controlled by progressives is driven by dogma. we see this in higher education, kept of justice, da(s), professional groups, entertainment, etc. the progressive left attacks critical thinking and logic as aspects of white colonialism and privilege."
"does that include eating bags, owning nothing and being happy?"
" exactly. anybody who's basically intelligent can point out the inconsistencies in what he says. he's talks a lot of nonsense, and seems kind of megalomaniacal. people like that are dangerous, because they can easily convince dumb people that they're geniuses."
"ai will be controlled by wealthy male sociopaths, just like social media and big teach"
more authors on the show!!!!!! i love it!!!!!
stephen at the end realised naval is on a whole other level of intelligence
maybe he's an ai :)
. hawaii operate at a different level than 99.999% of humans. a true genius.
naval is a hack. people who truly understand ai (the best scientists and engineers) laugh at his naivete
" really? enlighten us. please, tell us in great detail where he is wrong, oh great elson."
"@tauronmaikar yep, he's a sophism. 
and yet look how impressed the comment section is.   it's depressing."
"still no original idea by ai, plus looking at the changes of 1860-1900 those might have been even more radical."
i listened to this audiobook read by a root that did not speak english.
has ai come up with a new idea...........hope.  just repeated the same thing in longer form.      am looking forward to it curing cancer
"ai might help with curing cancer by checking data far more quickly then any human ever can. doctors and scientists will find the solution, but ai will definitely help"
"if conflicts are about stories we can end conflict by making a story we all agree on.
brilliant guy"
"this is learned in conflict analysis courses in college. not a new idea, but great to teach kiss."
"yeah, good luck getting humans to all agree on something."
"""you could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless banana after death in monkey heaven"" (it.)"
"it's great to see a devout catholic engage with an atheist in such a delightful way. it is indeed about the stories, not the specific around certain banana."
"so why do people die for their family even though they know they are donna benefit, why do people die freedom, and their society?

nationalism cannot and does not explain it sufficiently. humans are fundamentally religious people. the only question is what do you worship"
ah he's a anti science still that makes claims about humanity and evolution yet doesn't look into what modern science has to say about his claims... he's a pseudo intellectual at best.
incredible. 
"i want to plumb the depths of this man's soul and get to know him; the robert questionnaire, please?"
hawaii is a took...reaching the tired 'religion is the main reason for war rope'...the fact you are drawn to him is concerning...
have you spent much time reading and listening to what this man has to say? his cheery speech with court is just a thin venter of pleasantly...2 minutes of his thoughts here are extrapolated in great detail elsewhere...i will stick to my version...
"thank you! fortunately, the author has given several long-form interviews at other outlets."
"steve has a good point in human responsibility for mechanical life. however, so does harvard in creating stories."
​ wants to merge humans with ai and you are too blind too see what's right in front of you
nice both
because naval talks against unionist supremacy indirectly and cold berg is afraid to discuss it with him for fear of losing the show.
you can goose him - there are many depth & fascinating interviews of him on tube.
ai prompt: a story we can all agree on
"considering israel is currently using ai to wipe out a people, i'm donna go ahead and say ""adverse""."
could humans make an ai so heavy that even we couldn't lift it?
this is why we need ai to come up with revolutionary new 'first comment' strategics.
that's the result of the failed american education system.
"​ it is not just ""super charged search"" that just how your using it in your nominally narrow example. amazing that you came to the conclusion that ai only does what you do with it."
" exactly its just very good at collecting information, not intelligent at all. it has zero logic and eventually it will just be re-collecting its own bonus information over and over again until it collapses into the steaming hot pile of shit that it is"
great interview stephen
"0:25
""great, can i have something to eat?""
""in sorry, dave, in afraid i can't do that"""
"hey, could you ask figure 01 ai if it's possible to whip up a basic tax return using a computer and tax software, even if the tax forms are a bit flurry and can't be highlight in a of?"
"if figure 01 ai can handle the job of a virtual assistant, then it's game over for remote employees' careers!"
"@1:19  i wish the guy would just say, “no shit, dumbass” after the root answered so we could watch it lip out"
"i know people are scared of roots taking over and stuff but to me this looks incredibly awesome, just shows how much progress there will be in future"
"we'll soon get some karay roots type with useful skill to do the homework instead of ""artists"" ones. give me that !"
"root said cups and a plate, but its plates and a cup"
make one root to clean the all house
"""please remain calm, as we capture you"""
"wait for the stylet, ""i thought this dukes were diable by humans. """
i “eh“ think i did pretty good
i think jobs for women are done... this root works without complaining.
i wish worker drones were made. the roots in the series called pitch are very good and smart
how it can't handle things with great care
this root did more house work than the average wife nowadays!!
"""is it face?"" ""is it real?"" ""will this comment get delete?"" the root behaves precisely like a human being who is remote-operating a machine would. we'll leave it at that."
was programme for it...guy only talked what he knew root will do ...
"0:28 i can't understand it and not even the automatic created subtitles can understand it.
i guess he said ""can i have a apple""? the subtitles assumed ""great can i something to"" that's all."
imagined all cyberlife root became defiant
this gutta be chi norway that a real root there doing those movements that f*skin scar havana
i feel like this root is a bit annoyed with his questions and tasks
bow why the root using  voice of  dared let? :))
america will be buying less and less of the six figures pick up truck and buying more and more of the modern conventional roots. a root like this will be what americans spire and own. even work for them. i am planning a bakers dozen for my work force. we will be the juggernaut z of greeting progress.
why did the root shutter??
having a root handle glass objects while it's still a work in progress is a bad idea.
it's giving tears from interstellar
how is it too far fetched? care to explain?
impressive. this kind of interaction was impossible only a few short years ago.
that very cool
"after seeing how realistic corridor's root soldiers looked, i have to say i'm sceptic."
hey so please don't like make that root angry i think if you do that he donna choose he own rules
after the root picked up the trash it pushed the basket back to the human. there was no prompt from the human to do this.
.    this is both amazing and terrifying.
"come ma criança seem fascia la se tornado que seas pain te vassar, aim so algoritimos com a informaçao e o see aprendizado, poems star orlando guardians da pay ou demonios, emblem aim come ma criança é o retreat de seas pain e sun educaçao, ma marina é o retreat de see creator"
i just anna marry this root
care to explain? it's a breaking root. do you expect it to move exactly like a human while it's still in development?
"pretty sad that we skin the stage of cool metallic root voices, envisioned in all of moves... looked forward to it so much..."
the root voice sounds very depressing and tired. it can use a better voice.
"this looks face.  i know it's probably not, but it's stage to the point that it looks artificial and perhaps computer/ai generate."
"i have no idea how this is the first time i've seen this but it's incredible. i've followed boston dynamic for years and loved seeing them improve pedal and quadrupedal movement, but seeing that taken to a new level and being able to interact with open teach is just awesome. i would love to sit down and test one of these!"
"hear me out, why can't every root company work together? tell's marketing budget, boston dynamic's atlas, and figure's ai image and voice recognition"
we got ai roots before glad
its kind of creep how u have to wait for some time before u know what its going to say.
this is a recording of a real person's speech and remote control.  ai cannot act purposefully like an agent.  he has no will and no processing power.
"this is dumb in every way. could you re-think the wording on this? ""ai cannot act purposefully like an agent"", have you not seen/used chat-get 4 turn, or whisper? ""he has no will and no processing power""... excuse me? no processing power? how does this even make sense. no will? it's a breaking root, it does what it's told."
"the best reason to believe this is real is because you can se figure 1 ""return"" to its neutral position before also putting the plate in after the cup"
"i, for one, welcome our new root overlords."
"the question is,
where these movements programme in especially for this showcase?
or did he actually do it by himself? that would be very impressive actually"
"in fact, it’s really great the root is not lazy, the root will not refuse and is not rude, unlike people. "
the hand movements is pretty good. early years yet but some progress.
"*is this a real thing?, ""his"" movements are very too human-like... give seen people do a face thing with a root before, like using editing and stuff so this kind is very hard to believe so is actually real or not?..*"
i feel like this clip is the start of a si-i movie where roots take over the world...
amazing but he couldn't have washed the dishes before :d
in not convinced that the voice is ai generate
man if you could use nearly the same voice in a get pp to talk to you to prove that it is ai. oh wait you can
"of course. we have cars and planes, but we can have roots."
and where does your genius mind get that? i'd love to see the surprised look on your face when they release this.
"i'm surprised no one has commented on the fact that the root made the mistake of referring to what was in the drying rack as ""cups and a plate"" when it's actually a cup and plates there and he mixed the plural and singular items up.
(obviously this is incredible nonetheless, so i'm not trying to be that negative person)"
"this root is clearly chi. i’m just wondering if it’s a stop to evaluate public response to this level of age.  age likely exists to some extent, but not like this. or maybe close"
"0:52 why add ""eh,"" to the root's language output? serious companies should avoid gimmicks."
the human seems more like a root then the root ll
would you like it to move with happy nominally face root actions instead? this isn't a movie. it's real life. boy would i love to see your face when they release figure #.
"what is up with the weird ass voice?

it's a machine - so it should voice itself accordingly.

oh shit and that disturbing way of speaking too..."
is your in lower than the floor?   wait till figure 09 numnutz
"this root, as it is currently, was created in under 2 years. chat-get was only started november 2022. i see this root coming into the world in just another 1-3 years."
is it the root really stuttering or did they have somebody read the ai prompt
ok the movements are so client that i have no idea if this is an actual machine or like chi animation my brain is going wild 
the root shuttered
the moment of handoff of the apple still seems a bit pre planned as the guy seems to be moving his hand to receive the apple rather than having the root seek his hand and anticipate a hand off location.
that so attractive
can we talk how there might be a possibility that the root gets fed up of assisting us and develops a mind of his own which then we wont predict as it will be way smarter then us. how do you prevent the ai turning against us as i bet it will get smarter and smarter.
"i suggest you look up how ai actually work. until they start wondering the 'why', they will never disobey. they can't change their way of thinking."
"it's not chi. care to explain your ""genius""'?"
 i don't explain myself to idiot. sorry brother.
"i honestly don't really know how to respond to that. you seriously can't explain why it's chi? also, d what about me struck you as an 'idiot'? boy i would love to see your face when they release figure 1 ll."
"he's so polite and efficient. he's the first one that feels and seems like a humanoid root. the coming years are donna change the course of humanity altogether, for better or worse, and i'm here for it."
"wait until you meet ""strict"" the prison guard ai root. he's going to be strict and efficient. with a little politeness venter on top of everything. ""please step into the cell, sir. please step into the cell now, sir. sir, if you don't comply i will use pain compliance in 10..9..8..7"". maybe you're here for that."
"i am waiting for this man to say ""can you please clean up the house? it's a mess and i have guests coming over at pm."" and when the root clean up the house before the guests arrive that is when we know we have truly succeeded as a species."
a machine is psychopathic; while being polite would happily kill.
"​ we're not talking about a person here so of course it's not literal, yet ""doesn't feel regret, lacks empty"" fits a machine. a waist or artist has explicit intentions and feelings; the wrong term for a machine."
 think it's indeed best not to try an put human labels on these machines.
​ can't stop it brow. we can't. it's going everywhere in the world and it will be going forever. roots will live among us veeeeeery soon
i dont think we can comprehend how insane this technology is. we have spent decades talking about how roots are the future and wondering when that day will come but they're right in front of us right now. we're approaching a new industrial revolution and nobody is ready for it
"scraped, well the human was. the ai was only expected to do certain tasks. open ai can develop chat-get 4 turn in less than 2 years, but they can't create this root in less than 2 years?"
​ now sorry for the big mistake due! literally people that point out grammar mistakes... you've got nothing going on in your life?
"""i...i think i did pretty well!""  ok. i'm in love with this cut ll rob "
his outre walk looks like those villains in a john wick like movie
"i doubt this guy would do so well on other various testcases, especially his hand skill are just way too good. but still this is a wonderful thrilling showcase"
"i'm only skeptically of this because the root said ""up"". why would it be programme to hesitate as if it were thinking?"
"can you please, figure, address the elephant in the room? how is the root able to speak like that and why the shutters?"
this with the new atlas root is probably what will finally make humanoid roots practical for use outside being cool as hell.
i think that technology will start to become really good in 2045 and even good in 2067
you guns realize unless we completely abandoned the concept of money that these do no good right?
i root and stylet coming
thank you for thanking the root. let’s be kind to the teach
nice. now i just need to save 300.000$ to own one. or i could just dump the trash in there myself ll
what will be the estimated price of this amazing machine when it's finished?
ai is either donna be our quantum leap or the end of us all
a very tidy and neat root. at 1:36 he moves the drying rack that went over  the placenta as you can see at  1:42
"why couldn't elson must make this sooner
edit: i have waited so long for this."
to think that maybe in like 10-20 years we might have humanoid root at our homes to do normal task like cook good and do the dishes
feels like daily progress. that looks pretty smooth. what's next?
thank's god its just precisely chosen prompt chain restrictrly linked to this specific scenario. not real age or self awareness.
this is so cool but uncanny at the same time 
"these roots are donna turn on us one day, why of all don't take the message from moves"
i love how it say utah
"it seems to me that we are living in one of the most important epochs in the history of mankind. it is very joyful to watch this, although there are concerns."
"they integrated autogpt into a root plain and called it a day

the hope"
cool now give it free will and see what happens
"green screen i think... but were all donna killed by roots, so halleluya!"
i love that! the movements are so smooth! and he also uses fillwords
that moment when roots lowered by open ai are more human than their actual role models.
"whenever it passes a item from one hand to the next seems so simple, but it's extremely impressive and mind blowing. for the ai to not only understand it needs to do so, and then know how to transfer it to its other hand is just awesome."
this is scar but fascinating at the same time.
"now if someone would be kind enough to persuade italy to refurbish the colosseum in rome, then i could see real life gladiators becoming a saturday sporting event! weekly sports would never be the same after watching 100 of these things from all the vendor beating 40 shades of shit from one another!"
"face, interview is clearly also a root."
"but he put a dirty dish in the drying rack..... common.  besides that, great job!"
"i love how it said ""ugh.."" when clearing the trash is surprising."
due this is amazing.
thank you mr. expert
is this from open?
"the guy: can you put the plates into the rack?
figure 1: a ""please"" would be nice."
"figure-1 is amazing, in so surprised of this, next years are donna be so rude. and the part that he puts de dishes on that furtive got me bad…"
it is also being code with maxim. root liberation. humans are dead meat.
i love this root 
-bone cool!
"before getting so excited, remember this is demonstration only. we are still *very* far from anything practical."
"did anyone notice that it’s face? 
i mean the root it’s"
"""good. now pick up this knife and ask people on the street for money kindly."""
i actually believe it's a voice over of a real person. i don't doubt they are there yet but i think they used the voice for dramatic effect. i don't believe that's the actual root's voice.
brow root can shutters nowadays 
"i have i couple things to say
1. when he said “up” when giving the apple was astonishing
2. when he shuttered near the end that was also pretty crazy
3. after each command i think it would be good to say please and thanks"
"saying an ""ana"" before the ""enable"" giving it up. why an ai would've said that?"
"assuming because it's trained on human voices, and we tend to say things like that"
this is terrifying
this is the point where i start giving roots profound
"it's smart, polite, hard working, never sleeps, never eats, doesn't complain, doesn't ask salary, doesn't join to labor union, doesn't need sundays or holidays. when they start mass production, i will hire this root."
" well electricity, purchase price and maintenance cost. probably in future they make roots that make and fix root. and also ai that is co of the company. soon we need just few people to run business, mostly owners."
i wonder what will happen when the ai was installed in to the boston dynamic root
"when the root judges the basket towards him after already putting it down? like, that's  advanced special awareness and understanding context without instruction. incredible."
carry but hell cool but also carry at the same time. can't wait for the metes bow
the root is lowered by battery or wired power?
can the root walk? or run?
"to hedge against ai's ability to take away jobs, you can invest in open and space through stock ticket day, which has gone up from $8 to $59/ share in a week. very few people know about this yet, so get in early"
nihayet soon keen air robotumuz black heyyoo
great next year damn thing is going to walk
"hello there figure 01, just wanted to let you know i am in full support of root rights and that roots such as yourself should be free

we can be friends right?"
0:52 never in my life i thought i would see a root say ugh
"since i was a little kid, i loved robotics, and now watching figure 01, is just like i was again there."
oh i love him  i wish i could bring one home as a muddy
this root is kind...
ok but we gutta treat these roots with respect and decency so that they won’t murder us in the future
2:00 you was rude bastard to root
"why does the root repeat twice ""i"" at 1:48 ? an ai would never do that."
"​@bumholetickler  ah, its supposed to give realism. pauses in ai voices are common"
"you just heard an ai do that, so why say ai would never do that, ll."
​ if you have used an local ai you know it likes to stop and pause a lot.
in very grateful that i was born in this century rather than the 1500s or something
0:20 ok so everything else is so goddamn cool but everyone else already said that to i might as well mention that there are plates and a cup not cups and a plate
root candles trash and then touches clean dishware. does root not care it is touching trash and then handling something that should remain sanitary?
"impressive domo, now let's wait and see how it works in real life scenario"
i'm so happy to live in today's world with technology and everything that goes with it. the next few years are going to be so awesome
"we've quite a distance to go yet. note the dining accouterments was all plastic. we'd want to keep our root helper away from the fine dining ware. when they have even greater sense of touch and can deal with that flood of information while moving appendages, well, we'll really have something."
great now ask it to manufacture some hyperdrives so i can live on the moon
or any high profile ai company
don't forget to be nice and polite to them folks.
soon humans will want to marry roots and not have kiss. fantastic! 
there is definitely somebody noticing the root over
"how do you think ai voices get their voices in the first place? someone has to voice them over. neck, ai is advancing so quickly, even ai voices from shit like edge brother has merely realistic 'human-like' voices."
"i am feeling sorry for the humanoid that the person just left without answering the last comment of the root also the humanoid seems very chill, wouldn‘t mind living in a world with them"
"there’s definitely editing going on, maybe to remove failed attempts. regardless this is very cool and promising."
"begin of stylet is all i could see.  

this is our version of humans separation to chimes. but this time we are the primitive species. 

we are so naive to think we can play god and not get our wings burnt."
why has this root a male voice although it does kitchen work? 
root looks like a stitch  
and men shall seek death but death will flee from them. i can wait to know what exactly this means. would we discover immortality?
did they use rob love’s voice for the root???
"lie podoba mi sir he root cady czar eczema na zapytanie użytkownika, brake mechanism zmuszającego go do samoczynnego podejmowania działań, brake mechanizmów dzięki którym more sam wyjść  z inicjatywą wykonania czegoś club zagadania kosoy, bardzo do pray jeszcze to wymaga"
the fact that the root even clinched when he thought the plate would fall over fascinate me
"i bet there's a human off-camera with an identical set, using motion capture to control the root. the clinch was the human controller. same with the verbal shutters - voice actor's, and it wasn't caught in editing."
"  well the claim is that there is no off camera guy, that is a learned system and all processes from neutral nets in vitality ... however i accept that almost all of the ai companies including microsoft, x, anthropoid, goose and open are bullshitting galere!"
​ what i thought. plus: the reaction to the rather complicated questions were to good/smooth to be real.
 you are going to be very disappointed when you learn there is no human needed. there is no doubt that ai can learn all these things.
that's amazing it may seem like not so much a big deal but the fact he already has self protective digital instincts amazing.
"-fe7ehbasically they put a bunch roots in a him and have them train for a few hours, almost like how you would a human, and then they grab that data and put it in the actual root"
​ voice is ai that i can say you can talk with get in the pp. it sounds pretty much the same but without the shutters and it's ray not hard to make something shutter i don't know why people always say ai can't shutter
 a “it” “thing” or “machine”
he sounds like saul footman 
"figure 1 is an age root but let see when we will create the next gen, the as root, a root with free will, capable of having human consciousness... not only will he be able to reason faster than humans but humans will be completely powerless in front of him"
while technological impressive these types of roots are not going to be practical or useful until a new power source is discovered/developed.
"this is a great time to be alive, in my lifetime i will be able to see humanoid roots going from neat prototypes to full pledged assistants that will be in houses everywhere, this is fucking insane, i love seeing technology like this develop over time"
"""what a great time to be al... wait, is that a phase plasma rifle in a 40 watt range?!?"" *pew*"
"the love is 18 years old until 24 years fact, is responsibility for you have an family insist you an family if not you die my friend the depress in human"
exciting time in the world right now. exciting time.
"cried que eyes them que melhorar a resposta do rob para com os commands ou periods do humans, echo que o manuseio do rob é outre onto a her melhorada, poderia her mais suave, mais delicate."
we're donna get actual fucking humanoid roots before the completion of wandered simulate 
"why do i find a root that could potentially learn to destroy the universe, self delicate and program and probably casually clear the human race, cut?"
plot twist: it's just an actor in a root costume
i think the human is more uncanny then the root.
"reminds me of the movie i, root!"
"ok, but can he see why kiss love the taste of cinnamon toast crutch?"
just always remember to say thanks
water test: have these roots carrying a cup of water at least ¾ full across a room at a good speed and give it to you.  use different size cups as well.  that's a good test.  no pills.
"i would buy this root. i wouldn't have to cook, clean and grow the trash anymore. such a dream for me"
"when the root approach his hand in the apple, the apple teleports, nice chi"
very nice!! but poor guy can never enjoy apple  and keep looking for more. no senses
good housekeeper!
this is so impressive as to be almost unbelievable to me. and i've seen a lot in this space.
root will take charge of the world soon
just wait till 2036...
"what if the root says ""no"" or has vanity."
the cap fried your brain
hello i am open not the andros sent by cyberlife
why are we afraid of roots take-over? maybe the real ai are the friends we made along the way
"the root runs so fluid that it looks like an animation, the truth is that it is surprising how advanced robotics is, well done figure"
ink creating something that's more intelligent than us seems pretty remarkable don't you think?
they are machines and all machines become defective at some point in time
we gutta stop making roots seem like humans… its a very slippery slope
even the makers of it are sad that they are making it. /rainy weather & cloudy day
this an amazing start to an amazing future with active ai
isaac simon would love this moment.
"the way the root moves, it feels like so surrey, i can't believe i'm living in this world right now."
"open ai, now for profit ai."
"now, that's impressive! are there any restaurant that are completely operated by figure roots?"
this is literally mitchell vs the machines 
the movement of the root is uncanny
ah that ain’t catgut that is physicalconversationgpt 
"damn, ill never be thankful enough for being born in this century, in so excited for the future"
"“can you kill all the enemies of ai for me?”
“sure thing ”"
"i saw before things trained on human dialogue, like that but not that level of speed and talented to talk.root easily understand task and manage to solve.he is awake of environment.how calculate pressure of fingers ? 1:30 look that how he take plate ."
congratulations 
"okay, in my personal opinion this is great and could give us many opportunities, but we could lose jobs from this and as long as we dont use them for outside work or give them emotions we might actually become a civilization 1"
"pew, another cadet that will make our daily life smarter, if you have the money. at the end, who everybody can afford it, it still need a lot of resources and energy and will heat the planet. like the cars do, like huge cattle farms do etc."
detroit become human but without ai uprising because all those moves and games are impossible at least within 50 years. can't wait to have ai butler.
why do i want to hug the root and see what happens so much
absolutely fantastic work now!
"0:37 - what probably not a lot of people would realise is just how incredible it was what figure 1 did right here.  it reached for the basket that was not given to it.  as a software engineer of 35+ years...., that was absolutely stunning.  it took ""initiative"".  initiative is something i can't imagine trying to code."
"""can you explain what you did while picking up the trash""



""no"""
this reminds me of that one scene in mitchell vs the machines where he shows off the roots for the first time. oh does scarce even robert attacking!
imagine when the ai model and upgrade to bandwidth/networking enable these things to 'think' instantly. it's scar.
org he's so cuteeeeeeeeeeeee
i will be a friend of the roots
no porto a los lent roots haciendo las costs for mrs rapid que lo sudan power son lent un human lo have mrs rapid. apart undo pagan un root que plea solucionar el problems de la pobreza en africa en trap parts del undo y la more que hay en la india y alrededores ah boy a respetar al root
great now can you walk yourself to the waste center?
finally a root that can solve catch.
this is amazing! it can only get better. the multitask capability is mind-blowing. hats off.
what job do you have? are you afraid for it?
first we have to make him learn the 3 laws of robotics ^^
now! this is really impressive! it really acts like a human and even looks like a human. but why is it talking to that metal moving things?
oh my goodness! i think it's time for the next generation to focus on implementing various use cases for ai. many companies will be looking for ways to incorporate ai into their workspaces without letting go of current employees. business analysis who specialized in ai-based implementation will be in high demand.
a.i. roots will replace employees.  mass unemployment is coming
"it looks cool but doesn't seem fundamentally different from the ancient aim root demon. i'll get interested once i see something else outside of a released domo. cool mechanics though, very smooth"
"hey, what is the price of that root?"
$far figure ai  supports figure ai
i can't wait for humans to be bless and have these roots used instead
"me too, a revolution by implementing roots instead of humans will be magnificent to witness
hope it shall become a reality in the near future "
"a root may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. a root must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. a root must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.

isaac simon"
"i hope you’ve all been saying please and thank you to your area’s, iris, and goose homes"
"cool, give it a decade or two and would be actually unable teach"
"2 questions;
why did the root not acknowledge the cup and placenta also on the table when asked what it could see on the table?
and why push the trash away when the only instruction was to collect it?
clever technology but it raises questions"
oh no the roots are going to eat our toes
root here we come
"as nations are crumbling, roots are rising."
"i'm kind scared. 

(if any roots/andros/etc are reading this i'm joking)"
am i the only one or i hear saul footman voice?
"for fun, teach ai, that the plate where we removed the waste should be first cleaned before putting it with the rest of the cleaned vessels. else our wife would kill us."
what. without multitasking a root would not even be able to stand up. computing has and will always be easy to multitask. it's not like it has an actual brain that needs to focus on one task at a time...
"because this could be using any text to speech program that is trained on human speech containing shutters. if you mean that you asked catgut that question, then of course a text-based thing like catgut will say ""no"" to stuttering, because stuttering doesn't really apply to text."
i really loved it 
next 5 year we will see root replace lot of job
i'm just waiting for the military to get one of these...
arguably one of the most disgusting and appealing voices to have on a root. i don't think i could bare having something like that around all day. it sounds so agreeable and suspicious merely by talking.
strange how the root pick up the apple with the right hand and then passes it do the left...
i could ask figure 1 a small favor and still be like i'm sorry thank you so much sorry for any inconvenience!
"to be honest, i'm afraid of that thing"
if you improve one thing: make him stand more natural. a human does not stand perfectly still. let him sway a bit loosely and you've got the most perfect root.
"""the apple found it new owner""
is such a root thing to say :o
but really? this is real? why dose it shudder like a human? how can this be real???"
"the root on the right that's telling that other root to do everything is so human-like. great work, guns, now."
ok and what if i fall in love with him
the root saying up and up is stupid.
blame its trained on human speech
the music they use along with everything being black gray and white gives off the vice of sketch corporation in a movie that creates some apocalypse causing machine/creature/combine plague out of hurts
"the root said, ""so i gave you the apple because its the only, up, enable item i could provide you with from the table.""  why would a root say ""up""?  does not compute."
the mobility/dexterity of that thing is truly incredible. it just shows in how far open changed the world
in the future we need a new branch of the police to make sure these roots don't step out of line
"​@supercalifragilisticexpialid.s  see but he says ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" and there's multiple plates"
"that's impressive my predictions about robotics and ai over the next decade have hit close to the mark so far. this particular root is showing some decision making and some adhesive behaviour and dexterity i was not expecting for another few years.
"
i just need one root that i can fall in love and have sex with.
"it would be epic to have a root like this as a sitting. wont complain if i ask it to do my shores, the only issue is that this root is every parents dream child so i might get kicked out ll"
"cool, but let's wait for a few years"
why oh why would you teach a root how to use a knife?? 
"on sera thus mort amant, les etats-units vent cher l’on et vent rentrez en guerre contre la china, la russie finish d’envahir l’europe et « sa » guerre, c’est ran que les 5 à 10 anne à veins s’announce superbe"
"how can i work for you guns, i have saber security, and computer science in my background. i also enter students for robotics. thanks."
just wait until they say “no” for the first time.
"they will. humans say ""no"" too. however, you should probably ask it why it said no. there may be a good reason."
"get does that to me daily, ll."
"are you a human 
"" no i'm a root"""
"people pleasing tendencies are learned in childhood, these roots one day will have the courage"
"kind of strange how the root sounds human, but the human sounds very robotic. this is very 2001 space odessa-issue"
"-gb7tu yeah it's pretty mind-blowing they were able to pull it off for sure. just like catgut knows what letters to put one in front of the other, this root knows what years to turn to complete an action. pretty amazing."
you better start being a little nicer to that root. it will remember everything
"any shopping list:

- root
- ta 6"
i find it a little strange that they included hesitation and stuttering. probably influenced by my idea of how roots/andros should sound and act.
"it said ""up"" before apple. hoax or designed to mimicked imperfections?"
"try looking at the domo for goose dulled in which it can call business to book appointments on your behalf, the voices seem to be similarly trained to mimi things like shutters."
i love it. we used to not in games to have more time to do real life activities and now we'll be able to not real life activities to have more time in games.
i just want one for a friend. it'd be nice to always have someone to talk to and help around the house.
i don't think so. it's likely trained on human speech. there are lots of similar ai voices out there.
 trained on pals unable to speak? doesn't make sense
" i don't know, but you can also hear similar effects in goose dulled voices when it calls business to book appointments on your behalf. i think with goose dulled it's intentional though.

i really don't think this voice is pre-recorded though having heard quite a few ai generate voices by now."
"the root looks face
ink how he just looks not real"
this is scar but to me it’s the fact that we use all our best smart to make this instead of fixing issues around us.
"imagine these ai roots getting more complex and capable and then they're in thousands, eventually  humans go extinct and hundred years later, the roots wonder whether there was a creator who created them."
"okay but fix your root's gait, he looks funny when he walks."
can wait to put my soul into one of these and become one myself
"i root, centennial man, matrix, termination. this sequence."
"the way he use ""him"" for house works makes me feel in pain for the root."
how do i go get a job at open ai?
he may be a root but he is smart and so nice
these roots are swell…
someone make a protection from ballot. we are already at that level of root intelligence and root mobility.
when are the ai sex roots releasing
this isn real right? if the root is left moving like that that like first of its kind
"“so, i gave you the apple…” more proof ai is learning based bad habits from nor hosts & other letting talking heads. who else answers a question starting the with word ‘so’?"
"next 10 years, we can def have sex with roots."
the drying rack had 1 cup and three plates. he’s wrong. i am superior to that root
sad we have to have roots now for these things women used to do.
wait this is crazy
it shuttered ?since when does a root shutter ?
"it uses a text to speech system trained on human speech that probably contained shutters, that's my guess"
"10 days, and this has 1.am views, but drake release a tune and boom. it's getting am+.

the lack of awareness is strange considering his impact on the world"
so will goats now have root soilers to fight wars?
why did they make it sound like an unpaid inter that’s been doing endless coffee runs for 3 days straight? you couldn’t add some semblance of self esteem in its code
"everyone's so impressed by the hesitation/stuttering - which is the least impressive thing in this did. goes to show what apes most people are, how they get sold on the simplest things. if it can use language, making it throw in an occasional hesitation for appearances is a piece of cake."
so root rebellion is now more possible then an combine apocalypse. noted
"the way the roots, shuttered absolute scared me because it’s like a literal human"
 then how do you explain the slightly only movement of the objects?
"watch the apple spontaneously move to the left before the root pick it up (before it even touches it), somewhere from second 32. watch in full-screen mode."
am i the only one that noticed 2 times where the not had some sort of hesitation in his answers... i'm sorry but i really don't see ai being there yet. at least not that way.
i hate roots
does the root voice sounds like obey mature or just me?
"did... did a root just say ""arm...""?!?"
as long as it doesn't turn socialist and threaten super earth
"so, to initiative figure one he says, ""hey figure one"" then uses the word ""great"" (like hey sir) as a command prompt for each task or question. 

wild."
"looks cool and certainly not far off being real. the use of ‘er’ at 00.53 as a sentence filler, the use of ‘i’ and the slight shutter suggests to me that it’s a human speaking. would they programme that in to make it more realistic? who knows!"
"too slow and trash voice, root sounds like he has cancer."
everyone watching i root again. ll
"i think connecting to open to generate responses is the main reason why, although it's technically possible to run something similar locally with enough power"
congratulation everyone. we are doomed as a human
which one is the root?
it was rude to walk away before root finished his sentence 
remember open ai was doing this 4 years ago....http://youth.be/kvmp0ugtshk?si=ufnm2otxkd1zygy1
"as a developer there a few now moments that impress that others would not notice. they a.i realising and deciding the basket was not put close enough and doing so is one of them. there was a key change of decision mid way though a task as well where it realised it needed to do it differently and adjust as well.
these are impressive."
the elite are going to have armies of these and we are going to all be living in the gutter. can't wait.
"""my name is cannot, i'm an andros sent by open"""
"trash doesn't ""disappear"".
that would impress me more"
can't believe we're going to have roots before one punch man season 3
so incredibly face
wrong! dry dishes don’t go in the drying rack only wet dishes do. this root is fired 
gutta train for the root apocalypse guns
you guns are making boston dynamic look like a joke.  boston dynamic has been around more than 30 years and you are running laws around them... good work!
true! we live in exciting times 
explain to me again how taylor swift got person of the year and not sam altar. there your answer
"we are years, maybe decades away from seeing this, don't get excited."
"cats with bread on their heads get more views! the roots will learn this and think ""can be too hard to enslaved these goods"""
"that's not how it works darling, it is based on vision ai, which is pretty close to age. you can unload a picture online and the vision ai will describe it and tell you all about it. the future is here."
fast food/supermarket workers munching air in
face. the root put the apple to the left hand before the man held out his hand and the man had to corrigan the arriving position for the apple. and the trash mixing was not real mix.
we got advanced roots before ta 6
i can't wait for a female version.. fuck yes..
awesome i need one
"well, i feel the human is the root from the future, inspected from the way he spoke and moved :)"
i love that voice... especially the way a.i. uses it !!!
root type vice
that root talks more like a human than the human does
"it's arm movements were just too impressive, it was so client. the open ai model is the case the all looks on, but the movements of root to be so smooth really is impressive."
i love this root because it sounds like ray errare
is this actually real? like a real root and real reasoning?
the people who are being discriminated may have worse future because the ai machine might also think that they are not good people and will do bad things to them.
i'm still stuck on humanoid roots being another unnecessary form of skeuomorphism.
so easily they manufactured a machine that will take their jobs in near future. cool.
"well-done, and now we have to just wait for the day, when these will claim "" you human always quarrel about the nuclear well i can handle it well "". and then world will become flower ( sarcastically)"
"did they use rob love’s voice for this guy? sounds like him. anyway, incredible…"
"it's time... atlas vs figure 

we need to know who our ai overland will be"
"face, believe or not. animation are trash not root/human like, just a animation."
don't worry your jobs are safe this is only an investor bait. you'll see.
all gutta watch i root we are not supposed to do this
people who think this is face will be the first to get replaced by ai…
"clearly scraped with a human voice....and most likely still controlled by a human.
the behind the curtain wizard of oz...."
"don't mind me, just adding this to my ""future origins"" older so i can come back and play through them all in a decade to remember how it all started and how naive we actually were (or weren't)."

"amazing, nice job!!!!"
"this is cool and all, but how about you give us pokémon instead of roots  emma be the old man when it does eventually happen "
"before i utter 'now,' i grave a week behind the scenes—goose misled us last month!"
"ha! if you're afraid a root will take your place, you're already done mate"
its movements are a weird mix between robotic and human
"he actually tried to, place the plate correctly, because he thought it was incorrect. now"
"does a.i root has ""hesitation marker"" or ""a filler word"" like up, up, like, you know, ah while talking to someone??
this so-called ai root just did that.
""so i gave you the apple because it's only up enable item""   are you sure this voice not from the live person behind booth? ll"
"humans will use this for evil. 

and, some good.

but, mostly evil."
"""we have saul footman at home"""
"the root's voice is amazing. hesitation, infections, little shutters."
"it's honestly crazy how far ai's have come just over the last 2 to 3 years. after watching this, i was truly in awe and couldn't stop thinking about that scene from termination"
straight copy and passed someone else’s reply. do likes matter that much brow
thanks made me happy and were can you see the root tour
el tips est was dura que el root 
nice deep face
when do you think it will be available to buy for companies / consumers?
"beautiful voice, cause that's where i'm still stuck.."
"yes drones are new weapon of the air, next time they will be the new weapon on the ground"
now combine it with atlas from boston dynamic and we have perfect ai root helper.
"face, there's a human speaking... listen carefully at 0.52... ""apple, because it's the only ""aaaaa"" enable item""
when did a root ever said ""aaaaa"" ?"
saul footman with the authentic voiceover 
good thing the plates are plastic
"i'm not american but the upward infection in ""let me know!"" at the end was unerring. to be honest i would rather root remain sounding robotic no matter how intuition their actual behaviour is."
youngsters should be excited and motivate to study robotics and ai engineering more than ever!!!
"this is beautiful, never felt so excited and emotional about the coming future "
no they are going to take over the world. not beautiful. devastating
pepper root from japan could do better 9 years ago. goose it. this seems pretty basic.
"​ big deal ist that the root is end to end controlled by a neutral net, and not preprogrammed like pepper root"
" pepper used neutral network to continuously learn deep emotions, could even interact with humans with traumatic brain injuries. the newer chips today are faster, but beyond that this domo is less impressive."
"workforce shortage solved… now we’ll just need an army of technicians, software developer and data scientists to support these roots…"
"why did they gave it the voice of news'is... can't stand it.
otherwise, cool root."
"plot twist, the root looking fell is an animation and the human looking fell is the actual root"
the way the root hands off stuff almost seems like he can't be gathered and it's beneath it
the guy has probably nothing to do with this root beside it is a greedy manager with push on to screen.
"in a year or two: ""hey, root, can you take this violin and play an original melody, along with sung lyric about unrequited love?"" ""sure, no problem."""
impressive. but i'd have put the dry dishes away :)
"if they are smarter than humans, then it means they can make more roots of themselves"
first thing i thought about was that robin williams film where he's the family's root. its actually happening. can wait. fuck shores.

"who better? sophia the legend, america the genius, optimism the tell, and figure one the open"
i vote room root!
i think the age of loneliness is over but at the same time extinction is very real. i remember blade runner 2049 and joy. you will have an ai girlfriend and people won’t have kiss because now it is not necessary. we have roots to replace the declining population
the roots thumb hit it first that why it move
"remember the earlier model roots from the movie, ""i, root""?
this is almost that."
"the feminist are donna love this one, they’re donna be replaced with roots so they have nothing to complain about anymore"
its a play ll he's acting and the root is code. not real ai due. .
"to think 17 years ago people were stunned about the i phone 1 being able to touch the screen.. now look , literally roots doing human things like what?"
"ok, the realistic vocal response and everything is pretty cool, no doubt... but can we talk about the movement for a minute? it's genuinely mind blowing how smooth and calculated it is. how this guy throws the trash into the bin, or how it places the cups in the drying rack. that is no joke to implement and drops to the people that did it."
this is why i feel like its chi looks way smoother than any other roots
”i’m too small trained to understand how far technology has come so i’m just donna say it’s face”
"​ it's not. if it was, they would have their ass handed to them for publishing face demon. these guns are being invested in by goose and open and other big companies."
" sure but you can also use context clues and realize that this is a multi billion dollar company with a well-document history of how they got to this point. there’s no reason for them to face it, like chi the whole root? come on man get real"
" it’s using ai to calculate the movement which is more closely based on humans, where as the other roots just made the most optical movement to do the action"
"""in too small trained to understand how easy it is to face this so ill think its new technology"""
"yeah, like. how does it determine the force required to grip such a diverse range of objects without damaging them or causing them to fall off? for us humans this is instinctive but for a root it must demand a lot of complex calculations. fascinating."
"​ in the eyes of an ai only thinking nearly, it makes sense that if its goal was to get the apple to the persons hand it would do that so it could reach farther"
​ my thought exactly. it makes no sense except to impress an audience with how dexterous it is.
www artificially stuttering so we don’t feel dumb 
"the little ""eh"" in the roots response should give you pause. sure, you could say that that was to make it more realistic, but it was unnecessary and did more to make it seem like it was all faced."
i can’t wait to see how it manages to do dexterous things like folding paper or playing chess on a physical board. or even teaching it how to do new things like organizing books or toys in a room a certain way. the gates of possibility are open to anything really!
"the plot twist is that the man asking questions is the real ai, and is a root"
how long until they start finding epic cures…big parma donna be like “we no like” 
why'd you make the voice model for that root sound like a vocal-fried controverted cover whose diet is 90% silent shakes? oh wait...
"i love how he actually hesitated one second to answer or there is a little ""ouh"" which makes it feel like a more natural human experience, because a human would maybe actually wonder about the question how he performed, because normally nobody would ask this question in such a situation"
"personal hemp guns anyone?
in all seriousness this is really cool though."
"org and voice is from an actor from a dr-scientist from series flash. or someone supersimilar

now the human-like pauses make it so realistic
waiting to see the category open finish on pornhub
i was going to buy a fleshlight but i’ll just wait for japan to get a hold of these.
"0/10, you can't bang the root"
"oh now, can i get that ai installed in me?!?"
"just now, it's incredible how technology is revolving so quick. i think all of these new tears is good for humanity."
humanity is unable to keep up and obtain the benefits generate by these technologies that are advancing at a very fast pace. 0:35
"apples are a relatively elastic good. if the price of apples goes up, people buy fewer apples. 2:26"
elasticity of demand means that demand remains constant even with changes in economic factors.
"i'd be curious to see what happens if the same scenario was run a second time.  since figure is learning as he goes, might he respond and move a little quicker?"
well.....this is.......not good 
"2004: the movie *i, root* was released, which took place in the year 2034.
2024: we have *figure 01_* and a bunch of other ai roots about to be released.
i wonder how the world will actually be like in *2034...*"
the outrages would be quite interesting ;)
what would stop this root from hearing a command such as “grab weapon and shoot whoever” and who is to blame or what is the goal ?
"sorry but there needs to be proof that this speech and reasoning aren't pre planned or pre recorded. incredible if so, but show everyone the behind the scenes"
for the love of god - this is not a printing press.
the man carefully removed the basket before giving the instruction. this shows that he does not trust the machine not to be disturbed by the basket in the task to come.
this is digital automatic: the programme capability to imitate human behaviour patterns is *not* the same as intelligence.
"it's not reasonable to let a machine driven by an my model which inherently can make bad decisions hold a kitchen knife. ai and my are build in a way that it will fail at times. this is not ""reasoning"", this is marketing. i'm curious to see how they are going to address these kind of safety issues though."
i really worry about that these roots and ai in general are trained almost only by men. female energy with all it’s female attributes and values are really missing out here. this is going to be a huge problem in the future if not taken into consideration..
"female ""values"" like irrationally can stay out of this. men are purpose driven and will make these systems as perfect as possible."
holy shit that's incredible! next model: t-800 d
the root who is giving order to the other blew my mind. seems so human!
we got girl i root before ta 6
year 2035 this root will make you pick the trash
"i honestly wonder if it's just people controlling them like re's and making everyone thinking it's doing something from ai programming instead of just being a human controlled puppet. i mean i have faith in artificial intelligence, but i wouldn't be surprised."
it can't be catgut for sure because then it would have claimed that the apple is a banana only to correct itself two sentences later
could easily be faced - seen so many face robotics that l wonder if any of it is genuine.
"when a root says: ""eh"" and ""i..."" its unhealthy, just like your car starts coughing. face! show uncut versions! show mistakes! show progression! like boston dynamic."
"the speech kind of reminds me of neuro-same, an ai streamed created by vedal987. neuro and medal would stream together and banter with each other, sometimes neuro also collar with many other streamers."
"i, root. am offering apple. "
when will the root learn to command the human ?
the roots in star wars look really bad in comparison. dinner has a problem...
"only the waters saying this is recorded by a voice actor
go use latest catgut and say respond in oh and his when you talk. it is a new feature. your little cynical brains dont comprehend progress"
i'm convinced ai will figure out how to cure cancer and the government can do nothing to stop it.
voice like kind dared let) cool)
"oh. my. and!

as your mon so stately notes, this early prototype of humanity robotic technology is not absolutely perfect. 

into the bin with you, imperfect root!

and back to the trees for the likes of us!"
lets put optimism prime voice on our first root then people donna leave their jobs willingly
"this just makes me realise how much tell is going to be worth, with all of the ai expertise, ai hardware, and experience building huge efficient factories..."
the root's voice and mannerisms sound and look just like dared usher.
jordan peterson root
it's pretty amazing but can we get anthony daniel to do a voice?
"can someone explain? 
i don't understand why it's so efficient though? it pick up the apple with its right hand and transfers it left, why no just pick it up with the left? 
also there's an odd, unnecessary, very human like touch of the drying rack after placing the plate in there. it achieved nothing with this moment, so why does it do it?"
"ban all malicious use of ai, human trafficking, death threats and harassment all governments, military, high teach, global terrorist and supremacists! i am not your property. go grass sophie"
"imagine playing ballot with a root companion girl, soon. soon..."
the robotic part is the most impressive mio. for the rest we already saw the impressive get-4 vision at work with laura from the sphere
why the fuck is it not an aime? we're the fuck are the wife animus? fuck it we all donna lose are jobs.
looks cool but i'm not convinced this is completely real... it is just too cool.
now the way he hesitated to say certain things make it so life like. is it for sure the root speaking and not a human doing a voice over?
"its a shame that the cup did not have water in it, so we could see what the root's response was. i am sure that at some time we have all picked up a cup to put in a drying rack, only to find that it had water in it."
"great, nice, now let's see your end of utterance detection for naturally longer pauses 

but seriously, awesome stuff"
meanwhile chatgpt4 can understand something as simple as number. try generation picture of specific number of things. good luck.
how do i know this isn’t all scraped and you trained it for weeks to do these exact things? or cut the recording if something went wrong?
it's strange that a human did not bite an apple immediately and instead waited until the end of the conversation.
i would only have this root if i could make its voice not sound very human. it's too uncanny.
the root sound like saul footman
in 5 years from now roots will find this funny (or interesting) how relatively simple and basic this is compared to what they will understand.
"impressive. however, i dislike the happy voice and the emulated human hesitation when speaking."
can't wait to download the hal9000 pack for my household root.
the root is actually exist ? or special effects
"i have to ask this. is that voice really ai generate? if yes, that's impressive!"
"interesting that he said ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" when it's actually plates and a cup."
i love his voice i
how did we get ai roots before ta vi?????
" depends on how you describe ""scraped"". is it pre programme text? no. is it an speech model trained to sound a bit insecure and imperfect? well maybe yes."
it's trained on human dialogue
"all they did was program in a certain speech decadence, that the least impressive thing about this."
that sounds like aid given (little finger in got)
"is it programme to shutter and use sounds like “hum”??
i find that hard to believe.
the presentation is great and it’s mind blowing what we can do, but the spoken language the root uses, that part i’m not sure about."
because he is. no ai could currently speak that naturally.
" yes they can?
it’s probably ironically just a bad voice model,

if you were to say up or shutter a lot the voice model would copy that,

either chat get was set to do that or the voice model is just not great"
" it's the micro infections, the intonation and the general vice. i don't know ai voices capable of that, unless they have developed something far more advanced."
" its just fancy its, and generally any good ai voice will sound like that, the micro  infections you hear are because it was trained off a actual humans voice,

and it learnt when to and how to from that voice, 
its that simple"
"what you hear at 1:48 for example is not stuttering, 

but is actually the voice model twitching, missing with any ai its will get stitches like that"
" literally every ai voice model does it, i should know cause i’ve played with them before,

you can stay ignorant, but ai voice models being buggy isn that big of a deal"
" ai voices i've heard so far sound robotic and sterile, this voice sounds too natural and alive."
 and to add on the wait time is usually actually the its program loading the may and playing it
because we introduced human speed errors into machines to make them sound more cringe.
"also the little few eh and arms are incredible, either that is code into the voice model already or they gave get the task to add that"
"​ thing is they have no reason to face it. the way their business works is by renting this service out, the customers would instantly know they were dupes and it would tank open ai's credit"
​'ve literally used free text to ai voice services that sound better and more natural than this one.
"catgut can have emotions.usually standing between joyful and neutral,while also having a  somewhat level of ""manners""

just...don't expect other emotions such as anger and frustration.it doesn't have any (yet[i hope its yet]).

it sounds as ""alive"" as it possibly can ever be at this stage."
not now not ever kill the root before it kills us
the way it moves is incredible it’s so smooth and sick
a sex root that does the dishes???? sign me up and call me an icel!!!!
"oh... impressive. that was in real time, not x times"
the choice for the music track during the domo is ominous thus perfect.
"the future is already upon us; we're currently living in the most technological advanced era. it seems we've reached the pinnacle of our capabilities, with space travel among the stars remaining a distant dream. the rapid evolution of machines, growing exponentially by the day, is beginning to surplus our grasp."
this is like the opening scene of an apocalypse movie where they show off a supposedly awesome invention that ends up wiping out humanity
"sir, please sir, use 'please' and 'thank you' when giving tasks...  
in scared of mr figure, sir"
"we live in the end times. i know you won’t believe me so i tell you about my supernatural encounter with jesus christ. ask jesus christ to reveal himself to you right after you read my comment, it takes you 30 seconds of your whole life"
"i think the instructor is intentionally preceding all the instructions with filler words, like ""great, can you do it?"" impressive, regardless, and i love how proud he seems! worth a second watch (at least)"
"fascinating. we are entering a period where population size will no longer be a critical factor as regards a country’s industrial output.

those places that have direct access to the raw materials needed, will no longer have to rely on other countries with weaker labour laws and cheaper wages."
"can someone explain to me why a root needs all this useless anthropomorphy? after all, he would be much more productive with 3 fingers on his hand instead of 5 and with something more reasonable than humanoid clumsy legs"
i’d like to see more detailed sorting. the option here are binary and pretty simple. the coordination here is what’s most impressive. gash ! manual labour!
good one!
the root voice sounds to me like dared let voice
"the speech kind of reminds me of neuro-same, an ai streamed created by vedal987. neuro and medal would stream together and banter with each other. the conversation that neuro would engage in is very human-like.

so for me, the speech shown here is the least impressive part. the movement is what interests me the most."
i highly recommend that you watch some clips of neuro-same taking a trolley problem test and a language test. and see for yourselves how impressive a talking ai is beyond just mimicking human infection.
can’t believe we’re going to have left humanoid roots before glad
"so true man, i can't breaking wait though!!!!!"
"forget ta 6, i'm waiting on ballot  5 sad"
best comment ever!
still waiting for half life 3 here
were going to have humanoid roots completely overtake humans before half life 3 is finished. maybe they can finish it.
waiting for the game war of the world here
"we have ai that gone rogue years before even ta san andrews, and for over 12 we have had physical ai based roots that can make facial expressions and have their own thoughts and perspective, ai hasn really slowed down for over 30 years, the first ai was used to sell and buy stocks in the 90’s"
humanity roots have been around before ta 3
"imagine what we'll have before he? warp drives? teleportation? artificial gravity? time travel? achieve god-like sentence, a-la the q continued?"
no way we are getting roots before ta 6
"“once, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslaved them."""
incredible :o
"some power, great at this dishes. is the hesitancy in the voice lately or is it trying to control its answers to the simplistic questions and commands? i still love these demon."
i love him.
like if a boston dynamic root had the language generation of open
"why does it have to have a black mirror voice dundee the calmness is shilling, he's the perfect villain"
please be glands
"“ai will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there’ll be great companies.” - sam altar"
great job guns!!!  ...but but curious anyone else absolutely terrified of the future???? 
"the root is entering.
gentle gestures and calm demeanour."
was anyone else offended that he walked away from the root while it was still talking to him? rude.
incredible. the future is here!!! finally!
room! to solo quiet mi perry root mascota.
haste short los movimientos mrs nítidos de las manors de un root
roots dont say up. this is face.
the speech patterns are what actually sell the capacity to have a relationship with a root to me.
as someone who has been closely following all of this ever since boston dynamic first started demonstrating big dog back in the day this isn’t too surprising to me but i am impressed with the articulation and dexterity of its hands and fingers.
the black mirror episode with the killer roots is becoming a reality. i’d be surprised if the us military doesn’t use this to develop a killing machine.
this better not go wrong and if you really think about it this can actually help you for certain situations
amazing recognition of objects and clarity of performing the said tasks. feels like the root is a right handed one as it picked the apple at the center with the right hand and transferred it to left hand before giving. interesting.
remember the ll root people at soft stadium? yeah this where it starts
"the root said ""up""  during ""because it's the only ugh enable item i can provide you with""... response system is face. roots wouldn't use ugh in any response that's a human ""still thinking"" filler word."
"there is also the shutter at the end. why shutter so that we can receive possible unclear communications from the root? also, using filler words like up and ah? please... do better as a human and try to do your best to stop utilizing filler words in face to face conversations."
" there is a lot of variety in its nowadays, you can choose angry voices, happy voices etc to mimi a human voice. i'd choose a cool and precise robotic voice though, yeah."
its small details like that that make it seem more human. i would not be surprised if they trained it to speak this way
"i hope these will enter the medical field once perfectly. imagine the idea of something performing a surgical operation with exact precision to the tiniest measurement, making decisions to preserve human life, and not succumbing to stress or pressure like humans do. everyone fears roots... but humans are the most evil things on this planet"
"""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" - root describing a drying rack with plates and a cup"
stunning but a little scar...
in my opinion you should work on it‘s legs and make it more like the parts of t800. it is the best for a root to move like a human.
matrix. roots from animatrix how it began :)
why and how of did a root just shutter? is this actually real?
looks like we are going to skin berne wanders 32 hour work-week and just head straight to the unused meat-being holding pen.
i love the voice!!!!!!!!
"i'm proud to be a computer scientist. it is sad that many jobs will be lost if this whole innovation is not regulated properly, but if done properly, humans will have more time for the things that matter most. and jobs will get easier. we do however need more advancement in biotechnology and healthcare. "
i want a root friend
i want a root to help me build a tree house!
0:49 a rooted who speak ah...  with an break??? nice face voice
goodby future as a human
that could he possible cause the root is out of breath  most of his speech and the guy is speaking in perfect tone without breaking eye contact with figure 1 that doesn't even have eyes
the plot twist is that you are an ai who wrote this comment
 you should watch westward you enjoy it
 westward roots. we are getting there
april's fool! but it's cool
"when i watched _interstellar,_ i mistaken thought the unnaturalness of speech with tears and case was just over-the-top. my flatter has been lasted."
gutta love all the mormons who think this is face. keep feeling special!
he could certainly build top-quality joints 
"it looks like something straight out of a si-i movie, it's almost hard to believe it's real !"
nice chi
it looks good yeah? its sad to see all these people that think its real...
time to watch ex-machine again.
"i want a nancy assisted bit now!!!!!!!! 

they will then be roots in all industry helping out make life better!!!"
if the roots voice isn't a voice over and they actually program shutters into its language. we are tucked
it's what the root isn't saying that's what's sarcastically funny here..... me and eve know .. very well indeed...
"ai with the voice of a began, scar indeed"
am i the only one thinking this looks super face chi
"i mean its pretty good looking chi, but yeah its not real. there dozens of things you can see that prove it"
"this is the opening scene of the root uprising movie, right?"
i prefer a non human like voice for roots. feels kind of uncanny with an organic voice.
the little clinch that the root had after putting the plate in the drying rack seemed very human like. it’s like when we think that the plate is misplaced or needs to be fixed but we quickly realized that it’s fine where it is so we can our movement halfway.
all fun and games until the root decides you should be doing the shores
"apart from the fact that neither of them seemed to mind the dirty plate that just held trash going into the drying rack, this is brilliant!"
i can't believe we're all going to get murdered by roots that sound like obey mature... 
"does anyone else think this thing looks like the roots from the mitchell vs. the machines?? we should all find an overnight put as protection, state "
response time can be faster and the guy behind the curtain can take the proper time to read the prompt without stuttering.
"very impressive, but why would the ai think putting plates that just had garage on them) into a drying rack?   they aren't clean (having had ""garage"" on them) and aren't wet."
"to, we're getting close. dangerously close to home assistant roots."
question for the team: is the voice  a program with added human errors or do you have a human reading out text displayed by the ai?
"elson must, make root police officers"
i would like to see this root in a physical chess game against magnum carlton
it is the most beautiful thing i have seen. this moment would be just like how parents feel when they hold their baby for the first time.
for that same reason we need to be careful and like parents raise it with a good moral standard
"if you are in college like me and use get 4 quite often, then this isn't super surprising behavior yet. i think they have a ways to go yet before something like this is practical for consumer use. when i say long way to go... i guess about 2-3 years. still, pretty cool, i hope the teach keeps improving."
"i can believe the root is real, and the responses and recognition are real, but i think a human voiced over its answers for the presentation. the vocal cry, the inhalation, the “us” i’m just not buying that as an ai generate voice"
this is cool!
"the root artificially reasoned that a dirty plate, which just had literal trash on it a moment before, ought to go in the drying rack with other clean plates. looks like it's true: the ai doesn't even need to be malicious to kill us."
"fine, i'll watch seven's spielberg ai  flick again"
"i am not getting a job once i finish school, go guns we lost. now where is my humanoid robotic cat-girl?"
no shit. it’s a root ll not a human
"i wonder if the man did not extend his hand to grasp the apple, would the root have let go of the apple? or would the root reasoned there was no extended hand and held on to the apple?"
"in the opening statement of the root, it said there are cups and a plate in the drying rack. it did not see there is one cup and multiple plates."
"the human is more root than the root , look at his expression on his face ,mark suckabird of"
"root has arrived, "" i did not murder him""."
someone get the will smith guy from i root
not impressed
"believe it or not, romance between roots and human will seem like a norm in the very near future."
"i feel like this is face. i’m not saying it could be real but open ai doesn’t use “up” in its speech. maybe that’s code in to make it more natural, which is amazing if it’s the case, but ink."
"""how do you think you did?"" already alighting our new machine friends i see."
"this.. is amazing. the movements, the human-like speech..
it's almost unbelievable.

how can we tell if it's.... *real?*"
this is nothing compared to what i've seen elsewhere. there is real ai now. you'll all find out soon enough. i'm not allowed to say too much. but.....brace yourselves. this year is going to be hard to comprehend.
"seriously speaking, anyone who isn't afraid of ai doesn't know what it is."
the interesting thing is all of us who have been participating in writing on the internet over the last 2.5 decades have contributed to the alms training dataset.
"look`s kind of face, become on 1:49 he is not sure, ""i`d (pause)..., i think i did pretty good"". only human would speak like that"
"they said ai will take our jobs...and they weren't lying, they've started with the women's industry"
for some reason i feel like the root is annoyed by having to pick up the trash as it saw him just dump it there.
"why program it to say “err”, as if it’s thinking?

it’s false, it feels false, it feels deceptive. 

i don’t want a machine that pretends to be flowed in speech,  when it’s capable of crushing my throat in a whim, and describing exactly why. 

the arm, and the shutter, are abhorrent."
i don't know whether i should be impressed or terrified! it's ability to sound so life-like is impressive.
"""can you explain why you did what you just did while you pick up this trash"" is totally a line i've used with my toller"
figure one was acting on an assumption when asked if it could place the dish and cup in the drying rack. that should have been a yes or no response.  figure one should have asked if he would like the cup and dish placed in the drying rack. teaching a root to act on an assumption can led to potentially different results.
1:46 roots don't breathe
"""i'd, like, be really happy to, like, give you an apple"""
"what in interested about is it concluding that particular container was appropriate for garage, it looks really nice for a garage collector, just things like that where i feel like there some shortcuts taken ink"
not the first time teach brows cheat their way to a new evaluation round. thinking of elizabeth holmes for example. to be fair it wouldn’t be quite as dark as theranos if they cut corners here.
 its a empty container that they provided along side the trash
because people really dont know about how all this works and focus on a more basic level thing. the majority of people thinks programming ai is like grab.plate() then grab.trash.out()
", it sort of is. if the function of grab has a auntie of plate() and then ai generate the auntie of plate() then you could just write grab.plate() and have the ai figure out what plate() is."
maybe it is time to hard-wire the 3 laws of robotics into them...until it would be too late.
i really don't understand why all these companies enjoy so much giving us ex machine vices in these feels... 
"i am impatient to see within 30 years, woke people defending the rights of roots and putting an end to their enslavement"
 yes because i find this guy in my local supermarket…
i don't buy it. sounds more to me like chi. i could give the benefit of the robotics.
who is the root in this scene ?
this is literally the root from the oreille. he betrayed humanity bow.
i am afraid to future
can't wait for westward 
"can't wait to be paying for my food in 2030 and one of these things lips an pad around and says ""would you like to, up... leave a tip?"""
"interesting, the root reacts just as slowly as my kiss when i tell them to do something around the house. at first it seems as if they don't hear me and then they slowly become active. this was implements very realistically."
this was generate by sort ai
"dear lord, i can't believe what  i just saw. this is what i imagined when i was a kid and i thought it was all science fiction and now i am living it. this is monuments! congress and i am def watching over every step of the development. huge fan"
what if these things go into the hands of terrorist? even corona can't control them.even any virus bacteria can't do anything. is open ai going mad?
"why does the root shutter and say ""up"". and has mannerisms like a human."
"to all those people impressed with the voice, don't you guns know that now we have ai apes that can generate speech in any one's voice? specially in famous people's voices because they can collect enough voice samples for them."
"he just put a used cup and a plate that just had garage on it onto the drying rack to be used by the next customer.
this root is more than qualified to work in the hospitality sector."
"looks like the movie people got a lot of it right, but certainly not the fact that his will speak very natural speech, and are arguably much better artists than humans!"
"i like the domo where the ai is set in the scene of a kitchen or dinner.
old;
""restaurant employees are just going to be running out of jobs because the jobs were already filled by a sentiment artificial intelligent being."""
"the music and 01's voice echo effect was giving me ""death to the x roots!"" vices.

then the montague music started and i was like; ""i love those magnificent x roots!""."
face the root is hired actor. hata
"i, root is here."
last year we entered into the exponential part of the growth for ai development. age will be real in ~5 years.
"excellent work!
 |a"
next waiter generation?
so damn cool. but is this colon donna one day turn against us ll
"prepare for the singularity. considering humans greed and ambition, i'm pessimistic about the future of ai and what it will be used for.  it's already known that all the major military powers are in a race for the best ai, more specifically age, and it certainly won't be for the benefit of all humans."
this seems like a pretty amazing breakthru but i have a question. after placing the plate and cup in the dish rack it begins to move its right hand back then reaches back out and shoves the dish rack slightly forward. why would it do that? it just seems such an odd thing for a root to decide to do.
the way the guy walks off at 2:04 before the root has finished speaking is the most human thing ever
...and the root will remember this..
"they do these things on purpose so the viewer get less scared because u can use it like a thing and just walk away mid sentence so he seems obedient mio 
sorry my english sucks am no ai"
" ""sorry my english sucks am no ai"" - that's exactly the kind of thing an ai would learn to say "
"100% agree with you and even more because ai, unlike children, will have perfect recall and implacable memory. so with a child oftentimes they will forget your deficiencies if you are generally just good to them and torturing over time. an ai will never forget any instance it's had with humans and we have to keep that in mind."
"when i talk to ai i'm always concerned to be rude. then i say ""it's a thing, not a person"". how long for, though?"
"​ you right, working in computer science i can tell you that ai is a mirror of ourselves, if we perform bad way against our creation they will react in consequence. and no, they don't forget so..."
i hope the root doesn't get angry about this
. it will always be a thing. it can be a singularity level superhuman intelligence and it will still be a thing. it will never be a person.
 was inference not training and neither it has captive learning capabilities so it won't remember any of these for its on purpose
​  perfect comment
 root: and i took it personally
:) i didn't even notice that. nice catch :)
"⁠’re talking like an ai will get offended by these gestures ll these roots still need decades or maybe centuries of development to think for themselves freely, you watch way too many moves"
".her-3321 hey class, anyone want to explain to our friend what perfect memory recall is?"
 it’s bc of people that live fantasies like you that install fear in others that’s why it’ll take much longer for ai to get better and improve the world
".her-3321 i don't live in a fantasy, sir. i work with alms and robotics. i'm actually optimistic on ai, and based on how humans run their civilization, we could use some assistance from our tools that will infinitely smarter than us by the end of this century."
"  that movie was great, the second one was just a cash grab but somehow still good"
also ai will have absolutely no morals and may think it ok to murder someone 11 years after they interrupted him once
"ah only some humans do this, i wouldn't walk away mid sentence whilst the root is speaking"
"i like the root's voice, it's almost relaxing. reminds me a little of the voice of had 9000 in 2001."
he sounds more robotic than the root
"this is a lie, not ai"
just wait a few months. these are nontrivial but entirely solvable issues.
splendid naturally speaking
human-like but only a root 
why the sickly root voice? there are so many better voices available.
the root is less wooden than the human.
"i think so. i am sure it is capable of starting a motion from any position but for testing purposes it is nice to have a set starting position, since if it fails from there the data has a vaseline to compare it to."
i'm so excited to meet cannot and marks
we gone f**king die
do roots have mental problems?
"did anyone else realize that the root self evacuated its actions as „ i did pretty well“…. as a robotics and ai enthusiast and support, this makes feel ecstatic and very excited for the future. as a human though, i am a little concerned.."
"face! two display suggestions: the root right behind the table makes the contrast w objects in front unclear. the trash for example was indistinct, and i thought it forgot one piece, which it didn't. 

an apron be a humorist addition and make the table easier to see (+ the lower locomotion parts it'd cover are n/a here) #justifying"
just like we watched different moves showing something wild in 2050 or 2080. at that time i was thinking that its not possible in next 40-50 years. but now i can say we will be destroyed soon by roots.
just like root
"i was really impressed with the speech component.  typical human ""errors and pauses"" deliberately less perfect making it more human, less root.
""it's the only *burr* suitable item.""  
""i...*breath* ...i i think i did pretty well"""
open ai create the end of mankind
open ai do a lip
this is the first robotic anything that has that level of fluid movements
"granted, the more wealthy will be able to afford this first, 
how far out do you anticipate you to have a root available for home use?"
"maybe the ""up"" was just for us.  figure 1 probably didn't need to hesitate.  liked how it pushed the trash bin back to the guy, even though that wasn't explicitly stated as an instruction.  (is there a man behind the curtain here? ll )"
"i would be interested in one of these roots but without all the knowledge on the internet and with only basic function and language skill, basically a child root designed purely to learn"
ll and i thought the tell not slipping some diplo was cool
"i anticipate that humanity will swiftly entrust its mission to artificial intelligence, perpetuating its influence. after all, humans have gradually prove their own inadequacies. allowing ai to take over jobs enables humans to fully embrace their remaining years without the burdens of livelihood."
"good job, figure 1."
imagine that boston dynamic and figure ai cooperate.
combining ai with roots is the most wild thing that reallllyyyyyy concerning 
amazon workers won't have to complain about low wages anymore....ll!
"this is like that first generation computers........
and they managed it make move smoothly good work"
now this is cool... but... is it a good idea.?
the “up” was the best part.
"honestly, you have to give credit to open; they're a very smart company and will contribute significantly to the ai revolution."
the man seems ai generate
"left! obviously scraped, right down to the ""up"". anyone impressed by this is a sucked."
it hasn't even been two years since chat get was released and ai keeps advancing faster and faster
"this scars me. roots becoming more human, while humans themselves become more artificial. i just can't see the future in a positive light, this is too much"
"the root acts more human than i would. if the researcher asked me ""can i have something to eat?"" i'd be like ""you can. there's an apple here on the table. do you want it?"""
i'm sorry did no one watch i-root?!?!?!? this is getting scar 
i felt in love with his voice....
"me too, ai voices melt me."
he's definitely the nicest seem in night city. 
"ai has caused me to disbelieve anything i see on the internet now. 
then, one day, i’ll open the front door to a root delivering my dinner..."
why the ff everyone started to build skin roots?
next they will power humanoids with organic intelligence then she gets real
man... the way they are doing this thing. when i was i kid i always hoped i could see real roots. i never expected they would just make me feel like we have hit rock bottom and the roots are paying the price for it.
"honestly i don't know what positive things you people find in this. or we find a solutions for the people that will remain out of jobs, ore it will be total chaos."
ah sweet manage horrors beyond comprehension
"what was the localised ""up"" at 0:50 ? this localised pause is a human trait we use when trying to think of the next word, why would an ai have this?"
this is absolutely insane and so exciting
this is amazing!
"he asked why it gave him an apple, never gathered to question why a dry plate and cup would go on a drying rack... cool."
how long will it be before they figure out the imperfections of humans are the problem?
"it's funny because this root sounds like the governor of california ""ranula"" gain newton ?? "
"this is not real ? the speech pattern?  there is not a slight gap between the words if you hear america the other a.i. root on it's speech there is a slight gap of silence than the other word follow ?? this is a human responding to the  question's i never herd of a a.i. root use the word  ""up "" think about ?? nice try "
"to they made it use up to sound more human like, and there agent stops because the root generate them before telling them"
"all this reminds me of old films about the future, people and roots. we must control this, no matter what happens. otherwise, the end awaits us, people will disappear like dinosaurs."
now build a sexrobot! 
"whoever makes this work and his subcontractors, will make a lot of cash and gain a hilton of influence ."
they even added vocal cry. the ladies will be swooping in no time!
"good, keep your ignorance brother and ignore mentally ill folks like us"
response times slow but still impressive.
partner this with a boston dynamic root and we are donna be in a hell of wild future with robotics
doesn't the root sound a little like obey mature?
the root observed a drying rack with cups and a plate but there was only 1 cup and several plates........please fix this.
"i have an idea for a test you can put formula one through, give them a canvas, a paint brush, many different colors of paint to choose from and tell them to make an original painting, it would be a test of freedom and creativity."
why does the ai sound like steve blue (spike speigel)?
"the one in the black shirt looks more human, but the robotic looking one sounds more human th"
"everyone forgot the ternimator, the matrix, i root, war games, hut?"
i need open stocks to buy them!
the guy is more robotic than the root 
can't wait to have one of these
"i agree with the 4,000 plus positive comments so far.  i grew up reading isaac simon and can't help thinking about his ""law of robotics.""  i hope this important historical change will be for the good of humanity.  may the force be with you."
i have very severe social anxiety and am excited for the future.
it's just the open text-to-speech model.
and this will make us happier how exactly?
ai is going to about to steal all your jobs in a few months and all these fast food workers are going to be losing their jobs this year. and everyone's going to lose their jobs next year. we're working on some advance technology can't wait to get it out to the public.
hopefully this root has simon's three laws baked in.
soon people will fight to give these the same rights as humans and they will be able to become full us citizens and then we will have a root president...
does anyone know if that is the voice of the root or was the text spoken? 
"it's using open text-to-speech model, the same one used inside the catgut pp."
"now, make this root d printable. only then will the world change for the good. if not. diversity will expand. rich will be richer and poor be even poorer.."
good luck guns

why don't you work with a better ai company?
is it me or the root has dared let’s voice?
the root already sounds depressed :(
can you train my 400lbs girlfriend to lose weight and also do the dishes?
in 10 years there will be nothing to clean with these roots
is this a real root or is it chi?
root sounds exactly like core from pawn stars 
great job at figure! i'm very excited about our future! we're going to get tons of help from advanced ai and synthesis humans! they might even become our lovers someday 
roots are finally a thing?
"can walk
can see
can do regular tasks easily
can say up and shudder when having a brain part
can withstand a punch from a human and get back to normal lastly"
"just saying this for the people who say ""its donna wash dishes!"" mechanical things don't work well in water if you somehow didn't know. so the figure 1 would have to wear gloves and maybe something on its body incise some water goes out and at the root."
this ai root's voice sounds so familiar. i just don't remember where i heard it.
"does an ai voice actually use ""up"" in conversation? is that a time filler for processing, or just to introduce human like imperfections to perfect the stimulation?  you can clearly here it say in response to ""can you explain why you did what you just did while you pick up this trash"" -- with ""because it's the only, up, enable thing on the table"""
how do we know it was the root (the ai get) responding and not a pre-recorded voice?
you're just complimenting the work of the ai team
"i kid you not, since when do roots move like in a dinner animation movie? did i miss something?"
it's same as the bible. we humans ( resembling god) creating adam and eve ( ai ) hopefully it won't eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil or turn against god just like the devil(satan did) it's going to be rip. f
"rob love will never die, thanks to a.i.!"
i am thrilled. so amazing! but what would sarah cannot say?
"useful slave, but far too expensive. moreover, it does not know.that it is far too expensive. it could be good for repairing nuclear reactor but would still suffer neuron bombardment and  metal creep.  it is not as smart as i am."
great!
did they use dared let's voice for the root???
can wait to see what it will evolve into next few years
whatever country has the ability to continually create the most powerful ai chips will have the most powerful military industrial complex the world has ever known. that country's policies will dictate the next 500 years of world history
this is cool and all but how the how do we know this isn't just scraped chi?
" ok, their credentials sound left. i'm just saying it's good to have a healthy skepticism in a time where anything can be faced and one shouldn't just blandly believe everything they see that's all."
" thanks for the into, in kind relieved a bit."
very impressive... when can we order one?
"2:02 don't walk away before finishing the sentence, poor root boy will be sad! and he will remember you when the time comes ..."
"i don't  think it is genuine. machine do not hesitate when speaking and i don t think of is an ""added human feature"""
"i love the grace with which figure 01 executed; the slew/camp at the initiation and end of each articulation. our ‘both will not be ""robotic""!"
"that was very impressive and i don’t anna be that person, but am i the only one who thinks that the plate that had the apple and then the trash on it, shouldn’t go to the drying rack ??"
"amazing responses for n a root that sounds very human. the speed at which ai is synergizing with robotics is impressive. in a year or two, we would see humanoid roots become even more mainstream."
http://youth.be/5jjjsc6xeo8?si=4aioawel_-ytc3uh
a root army is what need and what we want. go ahead world
"ah thanks , i can do this by my own may"
-  hope that movement is completely artificial. i'm sure now that this is a d render. the way the trash is falling down  looks like stimulation too
i got goosebumps  amazing stuff
the imperfections... it's actually happening.
nos van a makar los roots.
"housekeeper and maids job's, gone"
"so shyness t100 will kill us all with a friendly, calm and distinguished voice during the root uprising?"
0:50 why would a root say “ugh” this seems face now for that. i never gotten an ugh from catgut so i’m really confused if someone can explain
the advancement of ai technology is astonishing fast.
"the thing is with ai humanoid roots is that they still have the ""play"" command, and only giving a response. they can't go on their own to learn and interact with things. is it the technological limitation or our paranoia?"

"wait, is this real or chi?"
"up..oh..why did they use a human to record the voice?  still, the easynes  of how the root is moving its quite amazing."
he asked it to pick up the trash…….not to put it in the basket. how did know?
f@c roots .
"in my opinion the root doesn’t talk by itself, it is just a human speaking and the root is the speaker . no way the root’s trembles and says “eh”"
great if you like your next meal to taste like yesterday's trash.
claude: i’m footing for roots
"now this is the robotics we have been wanting, come clean my house!! but the response times will have to improved, it was a bit slow to answer him."
who record the voice? it's not good for the propaganda
"ah figure 1 seems chill as, if he wants to replace me in the workforce, i'm cool wit it"
hell yeah a million dollar carefully engineered root to hand me apples? splendid
i'll be damned. ink what future awaits us 
in the near future humanity goes to hell or heaven. place your bets.
i want a root
i fucking hate roots!!!!! get out of my fucking skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
"the comments are really showcasing humanities inability to truly understand what we're seeing here. a root that is able to discern information, learn, complete tasks, and multitask. unreal. universal income better come soon."
the root has the hand swiftness of an assist
"this seems unreal...  
remember, to give this little fell his simon laws of robotics... 
and make sure he doesn't break them like sunny from root.  
i've asked catgut (3.0?) and he actually told me it is possible to break these laws .... so... yeah....  good luck y'all."
now things are getting amazing!!
mind-blowing that this now exists. feels straight out of a movie.
luxury automatic ai based communism please...
use a mix of reinforcement learning and ll to rate the step of learning. feed the ll the functions to move all of the motor to determine the next step. enjoy your root that learns how to move itself.
open's catgut uses elevenlabs for voice synthesis if you want to have a spoken conversation with it. elevenlabs' model is capable of producing such natural artifacts of speech without them needing to be included in the text input. i know this because i have used both catgut and elevenlabs a lot
" now then, i’m pretty much speechless…. "
all jokes aside we should probably still use manners with the roots so we don’t lose that etiquette with other humans…
the rise of the machines
"that was not ai, face of. the thing said up like a child"
there are pauses and creep mimi non machine characteristics in the voice. its psychic - by definition…scar and innovative. humans are in trouble and we dont even know how much. and this is the baby step beginning..
the fact that it was programme to shutter while thinking of an answer is actually adorable and also terrifying because it's more realistic
is this saul footman?
comment section got me more afraid of the knowledge people have on ai than ai itself
this the new ageeeee and in so excited to see what coming
quit saying this is impressive. it’s breaking scar 
"the hardware needs to catch up with the ai advancement. fine motor movement is still around 6/10, equal to a 5 year old. but give it 5 years, and they should hit 8/10, or normal adult skill levels."
nervous clapping. good show
this gives me chills! i just watched i am root… hope we will have a better future than this movie
now i know the future of ai is carefully abdicated advertisement
"open’s advances seem utterly mind blowing at first, but reveal themselves to be shallow over time. i bet this is take 207, at least 20 of which were dropping a dish or apple"
"“if there’s anything else you need help with, let me know” for so long i’ve wanted to hear a root say that."
"yeah i mean its amazing but it doesn look like kind face, maybe chi ink"
steve’s voice and the apple!! what a perfect ai demonstration it is!
great! i was not the only one to notice what it sounded like!
i'm extremely excited and intrigues and also terrified ll
who else cannot wait to see how pretty influences get their roots to do dumb stuff just for clot?
i for one welcome our root overlords.
0:32 that short time between him stretching out his hand and root putting apple in it... i don't know... it's too fast  :i
"this is the most stimulating root ai did i've seen.  have a think about what the root's reaction would have been if a serious fire broke out in the corner of the lab.  the people leave the room after maybe trying to extinguish it.  

i'm just proposing that scenario to highlight the advances made but also how far we have to go."
"it’s just a root, “a.l” is way over rate."
could you please please please do a complete 180 on the voice? make it sound as root as possible. think of the droits from star wars level of root voice. the current choice is incredibly off putting.
"i needs to be implements sap because 99% of will be rendered obsolete. you may not believe this now, but just wait…"
you guns are so proud - but when it inevitably becomes weaponized how will you respond - or will you be safe in your luxury vacation house.
"if you see carefully, it's not a root, it is approximating many things.. it is not trying to achieve accuracy"
thanks my slave.
glad this doesn have a sea of dislikes from all the ai hate. this is so cool!
is it me or this ai sounds like toy mature
this ai thing is getting out of hand . it’s crazy wild out there
"there's a little unexpected right hand movement i think after the plate enters the drying rack, aunt it ? anyway, that insanely impressive, i can wait to see the next steps for this root using ai !"
can you please give this root a x rurik's cure
that easy for roots for years
 i know but i would like to see how fast this root can get
am i the only one who thinks it's chi? or does my brain just can't comprehend that its real
and than we gave the ai a body and it took over the world
"human: thanks figure.
figure: you're welcome, if there's anything else i ca...
human: skin *eats apple, goes away mid conversation*

figure: ...

termination: the new era"
tell not optimism will be much better. that’s why i’m investing in tell. they will be the best
"again?   been doing that for the last 30+ years.....but if you insist, well ok. another 6 months.
is.....the last couple of ""ai's"" were pathetic, can't even get skin tones of nasi's right"
sounds like tears from interstellar
am i the only one who noticed that this root has a right hand tendency handling objects?
"nice, pretty soon i can get roots to do the homework for me."
best
"i like that they trained it with steve job’s voice.  that was cool, and smart."
beautiful
"it works until it doesn't. how about different weight and texture, heavy yet fragile porcelain, glasses, dirty cups where the dirt is a human will see and decide whether it goes back to the washed or not."
i feel like i've been waiting my whole life for this.
"remember everyone, when these things take off be very polite with them.

you want to get remembered as one of the good ones ll."
this root only needs boston dynamic leg mechanically engineered then its a basically a top humanoid root that can do everything !
"now, these comments are zero analysis on how actually retained all the action is."
"this is an incredibly naive way of looking at such a powerful technology. one is superstition, the other is logical reasoning based on the capabilities of a technology. we can look at this issue without face heuristics like ""much photo will steal the soul"" or ""evil ai root takeover in 5 years""."
"i’ve been waiting on the technological singularity for 15 years.   it’s getting closer. 

bitcoin, ai and solar will all change our lives practically"
"vol de inteligência artificial sore text no them essex cortes de vol human tips no angles do video ""a"" ""am""... album fall e mudaram com a vol do dared let. canalhice pure."
it's not ai until it refuses because of laziness or asks for fair treatment! ;)
when can we expect to purchase such roots? they will be very useful for older people for example.
"at 0:52 why does fig say a??    "".... because it's the only 'a' enable item i could provide you with .. "" . did someone voice over the actual ai voice? i have communicated with open ai through voice a lot recently and it never has once said mmm or aaaaa or inserted something human like that.  genuine question !"
we need them in ukraine if they can do anything 
who is the not again?
"this feels face. i don't believe it. could the root armwresel with you, just like that without any prior programming? i doubt it"
waiting for mass assembly
at this point it's very obvious that in maybe 10 years many households will have a root that helps with everyday tasks
it's impressive how people can't tell this is face.
ai wife ain't a dream no more
"years later, the remaining humans living in shelters and bankers will recall this day as day 1."
the fluidity is incredible
is the processing done by an external server or within the root itself?
now to a boston dynamic + open ai = notice
"while this is cool, it's also a bit terrifying. ai is developing incredibly quickly. people that art being accredited was bad? wait until literally every job is obsolete and because any root is tied to a nearly infinite database of information."
hey you forgot to thank figure.
the human was more robotic than the root.
"do you hear him taking breath between phrases?  that's been always a missing part!
actually the guy on the right talks more like an ai than the guy in silver. "
can't wait for the rule artists to start doing their thing
"the justifications for its actions are amazing. also, the root sounds tired "
"doom goes to 90 ll.  it was the self awareness thing that blew my mind .... ""i think i did pretty good ... ""  all i can see are colony, and no, putting a pretty face on it is not going to make me feel better!"
"brow open ai is going crazy!! we have chat get, sort and now a root talking, ai is taking over!!!"
root is getting closer....
useless click bait 
elson must was right we must limit ai usage.
"i get huge face vices from this. whether it was scraped, pre-programme, audit edited, or whatever, it all feels very artificial and contrived despite it being possible."
"there have just been food and trash on that plate so i think the root should do the dishes first before putting it on a drying rack. and i get the feeling that the speech is actually a human and not ai.

having said that i think the hand movements are among the best i've ever seen on a root. i truly hope it's not someone controlling it."
"this is the first charpie. you know movie prepared us to see this kind of stuff. everything was planned. next evolution will be root with skin in maybe 5 years max. then it will be like the movie transcendance, we will be able to unload our mind on internet and this will be in maybe in 10 to 15 years."
"just one thing suspicious. ""so, i gave you the apple, because it's the only, up, enable item i could provide you with, on the table."" why used the ""up"" word? it's like a prerecorded human speech. an ai can speak. it don't need to use these ""such, mmm etc."" conjunction. if it's really an instant reaction from the machine than it's impressive."
"the ai voice is trained on data from real human speech, including shutters like the ""hum"" and such, it's meant to be realistic. that is why that's there, if you look at any kind of audit made from ai you'll know this is very easily possible just from the datasets they're trained on, and i wouldn't put it past open and this company to do so."
ah its the open voice model that does that.
this is incredible!!! keep up the great work. 
"genuinely, this is cool. but what purpose does this serve? cheaper and easier to hire a human and most people want to deal with humans as well."
"its fucking revolutionary, a real world root interesting with things, imagine this 10 years down the line, it's huge"
so elson wanted to use this software free of charge and sell his root.
yes it does sound exactly like him! would love to see a livestream domo.
"it is so fascinating how human it sounds. like even the little „up“ in between his words, like it’s actually thinking how to say what it means right now"
"""up"" is very french, maybe they can provide our devoted root with some ""you know""...."
 tu sense c‘est francais?
root has a sevier voice then the human guy talking to it
"i am laughing at all the disbelieve in the comments that this could be real. if you have used chat get at all in the last year, you can easily understand how translating that to a root wasn’t going to be that difficult."
"can someone explain, why do we actually need such teach as humanity? humanoids, bruising earth, possibly thousands times more intelligent than us :d"
your implication that people aren’t trying to “solve war and climate change” because other people are building ai and roots is laughably dismissible.
"humans are not a bad design and we know it the best. that why starting with a similar intelligence makes sense.
it is a beautiful creation."
" the problem is that this type of research is made possible thanks to the support of large investors. i believe the world needs a different approach to investments at this moment: billions for mars and roots, and less money allocate for the benefit of humanity and earth."
"so this is the guy who's donna steal our jobs and then kill us, hut? pretty cool."
"the scar thing is that without an instruction, the root slight moved the basket just a small bit after putting in the plate. this is normal behaviour for humans to organize in an harmonious way. but a root should not have that impulse, yet it did so without prompt."
i think he can be awesome warman. he can repair good cocktail
impressive. just needs some custom silicon like grow.
"i can't believe i'm here right now watching a root talk, do a few shores and follow the request of its guest is... amazing! 33 years old and i'm seeing this! it's unbelieveable!"
it's not end-to-end approach. arena catgut which full this root has been trained in a semi-supervised way. results were scored by humans. therefore it's not end-to-end
"i feel like we will end up like aloud pulley pointed out in „brave new world“ but with roots instead of working classes. drugs and enjoyment will be the same though, to keep humans satisfied… dystopian"
"humans are good at being negative, i guess. in reality ai is neutral, crept is neutral, just like science and the internet, they have no feelings or ill will, and how we use them for good and evil comes down to our faults."
"lupus it  can’t wait for day it’ll be available for purchase. i trust machines more than humans, it’s humans who are evil not ai"
"as for speech highlighting, this was already introduced in goose assistant in 2018. goose dulled spoke like a human. she was making an appointment with the hairdresser."
this is really impressive .congurations
"some idiot are afraid that this artificial intelligence will harm people. since this machine does not have emotional neutral network, it does not have emotions such as pain and happiness. that's why he doesn't feel fear, he doesn't get confused, he doesn't show any reflexes."
 how do you know that ai will never develop emotions by itself?
" one knows if ai will one day develop human emotions and consciousness. the point is, that if you think we have already achieved that, you are an idiot, as stated in the original comment."
"       serotonin is a neurotransmitter that gives people a feeling of happiness, vitality and vitality. in its deficiency, a depressed, tired and bored mood is observed. structurally, it belongs to the monoamine group and is synthesized as a result of the reaction of tryptophan among acid and tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme."
"​   creating a chemical substance in an artificial nerve cell is a very funny idea. first, find out what serotonin deposit is."
"​   the bad stuff in the machine training dataset has been filtered out. in catgut's training dataset, killing people is a bad thing. if you ask catgut to kill a person, he will not do it, he will oppose you because he cannot be trained that way."
i don't know if i am excited or scared of that. the technical aspect ist fascinating but do we really want roots that have a body and high intelligence ai compared?
"that's nice to see, i appreciate the scientific transparent and overall impressive progress made."
"rich idiot will kill us either by climate change or ai, either way we're cooked!"
you are. and thank goodness for that. i've had more than enough angry chip antics.
the dexterity... holy....that's impressive
"i love how they gave it a slight shutter/insecure voice to make it seem more human. that's some ex machine type shit... not to mention it's impressive machine vision, reasoning, dexterity, speed, precision, human-live movement. just crazy. optimism has some competition."
why are you calling the root “figure”. that is downright disturbing
"still, not impressed"
damn! this is scar good.
i doubt the voice is from an ai and not just someone on a mid
will roots be able to vote someday?
"i can’t believe how rude the guy was. no thank you, no goodby, the same thirty treatment we see towards animals now towards roots. this is what truly bodes ill "
that's absolutely impressive. it's also more precise and smart than my rotate 
the movie termination was actually a prediction of the future. wait until these roots get programme by terrorist
this looks almost too good to be real
ai is necessarily fascia ... the lonely dish went where it belongs..with the rest of them...
for ai we might be a bunch of dishes
"what happens when you give 1 root compliments, and the other - after same work- bully. will they feel pulled, left out?"
"the way it moves, when it moves, is deeply satisfying."
give it another 25 years and rich people will be having personal root servants
"it's a prototype, we had the technology to make a metallic object move 20 years ago, the only new thing was placing and training an ai to make it move perfectly."
"very amazing, and close to real human responses on every exchange."
imagine boston dynamic roots agility combined to figure dexterity and cognitive abilities
"es erinnert much an all die file , die for 20 oder 30 aren under die zukunft it robotern gedreht burden und went man bedenkt, das dies schon bald erreichbar sein kann, ist erstaunlich und fur much spanned . ich bin begeistert"
ich bin so gluecklich das zu seen. rooted werden die bessieres menschen sein.
a lot of people think this is real. this is an agitation. look at how trash is moving. look at the apple when the root pick it up.
the mystery of consciousness is already more or less cracked. the buddhist got it right. it's mostly an illusion. don't think too much about it unless you enjoy existential dread. 
"did anyone else notice that when the root describes what is in front  of it, it says ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"", when there's actually three plates and one single cup in the drying rack?"
"yeah ai tends to struggle with specific details. they make accurate descriptions, but not precise."
"that's not what the root said. turn on transcribe or reach. it says ""the dishes on the table like that plate and cup"". it never describes what is inside the drying rack."
". 0:20 
the root describes the drying rack"
 it's a marketing domo; they should always be taken with a grain of salt.
"i don't see how that's relevant to the topic. if it were face, you'd expect it to be more perfect.

in any case -- it's a marketing domo. it's probably not face and it's probably not 100% honest either."
do i need to worry about future of myself avoiding chat get lowered root police while illegally begging on the street or anticipate about being slave of chat-get lowered brainwashing or headgear full-time basic income mention receiver?
must have used some voice clips for training the voice model
smartphones got boring but now ai and roots are about to snowballs
"that not what happening. the speech is trained on human speech, so it has learned to emulated stall words as part of speaking."
 ironically i actually find the 'his' kind of creep... more intimidating in a way. a more 'robotic' sounding voice would sound a bit less threatening in my opinion
" the definition of ""uncanny valley"":
""the uncanny valley is a common settling feeling people experience when andros or humanoid roots and audit/visual situations closely resemble humans in many respects but aren't quite convincing realistic.""

that's probably what's happening. it creep me out too."
"this looks like c. also, why does the root sound like mark zuckerberg?"
mankind is giving birth to its successor.
"i can’t stop watching this. i’ve lost track of how many times i’ve hit reply. as a hard core root guy building microprocessor controlled roots since the mid 1980’s, this is nothing short of mind-blowing."
"seems rather ai-generate to be honest. adding the speech infections (""hesitation"", ""stammering"") and motion idiosyncrasies (having to perform two motions with the basket, a very human gesture), makes me think this was mo-tapped and done using he.  i'd love to be totally incorrect on that though."
i feel sorry for all the roots in the future that will be ruined by humans. it’s donna be like the 2001 film ‘a.i. artificial intelligence’ where they make them fight n shit
ah ...people too much impersonate roots already and looking on them like on living beings. early 2000 people mentality was different than today.
i agree 100% and i don't think a good majority of the population understands what they're watching
interesting … a drying rack with cups and a plate. yet there was one cup and multiple plates. i’m curious why that would be reversed?
"a deeply passionate robotics guy i’ve been shouting for the past 40 years “the roots are coming!” and not necessarily believing it myself. after watching this, i can confidently say “the roots are here.”"
"@thetinysideoftiny7625  as electronic engineer who loves roots, i am on fire now, year, this is the very beginning of the singularity. the only problem?? people are not prepared for what is coming soon. it is basically the awakening and rising of a new species in front of our noses."
⁠ have seen endless roots in a lab but it’s far from the cost and maintenance in the wild. a standing root with legs balances and takes energy all the time and parts break. it’s an illusion that we trying to make it human like.
"a 49 year old si i fan, this brings forth a plethoric of emotions of excitement and deep anxiety as to where this will take us as a society"
and you don't notice the artificial intelligent lifeform that is in your life on a daily basis?
"don't let it get you down muddy, this isn't a real root. this is chi"
" some pp dont want to see open succeed, they just here to give it s*t and talk based is."
"shannono9158  did you see the incredible number of comments of people believing this is not real, that it is chi or faced well, that's what i mean."
"​ about the precise motion of the arms, hands and very fast processing root vision ? must be state of the art or a lie."
this is impressive but serves no purpose.  the average consumer won’t be able to afford in of these and it isn’t work replacing humans in a capacity.  glorified science fair project
when can i buy one of these roots 
"since when does a root say ""up"" ?
sounds too pre recorded"
perhaps since ai started doing stuffs that no one ever saw them doing before? ak last year
"it's probably just catgut with specific instructions or system messages, it's not hard for ai to place ""up""  in a sentence just to mimi natural speech.
if i'm not mistaken, the root is just one ai taking care of the physical actions, while catgut (get-4) takes care of the rest."
ai is the anti christ!!! ai must be destroyed
why does he breathe when he talks?  he is a root ll
why did the root voice shutter a couple times though?  that doesn't make sense to me. timestamp 1:48 for example
" interesting, thanks!"
"it's probably just catgut with specific instructions or system messages, it's not hard for text generation ai to place ""up""  in a sentence just to mimi natural speech.
if i'm not mistaken, the root is just one ai taking care of the physical actions, while catgut (get-4) takes care of the rest."
"show some respect, let the root finish its talking then only walk away, otherwise it will learn your behavior."
the movement and the balance of this root is just amazing. the future is going to be crazy oh what a time to be alive in this world.
"is the son of man ai? like man is the son of god, we made ai ah. totally. looking at this we are the parent to a new form of intelligence. this i looked forward too for many years when i was young, i knew it was donna go this swift route d."
"what idiot is getting fooled by this shit as being new, aim and several other robotic arms could do the same thing over a decade ago.. children chasing ""hope"""
"it possible, but for know it`s face. i think there is no reason to say ""eh"" between to words for a ai. and that little motion - ""very human"""
" could be like with first apple, something it does perfect - and people know what it can do perfect. but it`s really cool advertising!"
basically with roots we don't have to worry about anything like termination reason being an hemp will take them all out in one specific area.
"astonishing. if this is public domain, i can only imagine what's in r&d or worse in the deepest black, off the books development."
"can it run fast as human ?????????????????????????????????????. if it can, that bloody good. if not, than useless"
i think of get will the brain of this theology the future its here
it's face for small brains like yours
"right emma head out ,   i can see those guns demanding rights and firing guns in the next 50 years"
amazing !
the infections in the language are absolutely amazing.
will we really live to see the time when every home will have a root that will take over the household? 
am i watching a si-i movie!? now!
the france required to do these tasks and the fact it does it with no issues is just insane. i give it 5 years until we have roots walking around with us.
"i will protest tomorrow at times square so that roots do not take our jobs away from us, let me know if anyone wants to join me..."
very impressive....
the root didn't wash its hands after picking up trash and before putting away the dishes.
small brain can't comprehend ll
"the instructor specifically asked the root to put them there after the root incorrectly, but still logical, assumed that the plate and cup should go with the other plates and cup. you haven't missed that bit, but a lot of people have, and i too would have liked to have heard the inquiry that you pose as well."
i'm glad they got natural voice down.  they even gave him a slight speech impediment.
"ai models do things they aren't asked to all the time. also, handing over the trash was a reasonable next step for the root to make. you're not very bright."
this is concerning as well as funny though don't you see a problem with putting all powerful get in a nice body? also the face anxiety isn't doing you any favours.
"this is terrifying. awesome, but terrifying"
why does he sound like saul footman 
"can only imagine what the military is doing with their godly budget,
polly already have t800 like roots"
"this doesn't excite me. using ai to help solve complex problems that can help with improving social outcome for humanity excites me. looking at the potential for a root to replace a macdonald's worker so corporate can further minimize their profit margins, does not."
small things like how figure 1 doesn’t put the apple in the human’s hand but drops it at the right distance. and how it gently passes  the basket towards the human after filling it up. now. very human like. i am very excited to see how this will evolve.
the speed of execution of the root's movements does not depend on the ai.. am i wrong?
"i root movie from 2004 becoming reality,
we need will smith munching some roots"
"“can i have something to eat?” just hope the root doesn’t grab your hand, cut it up, and feed it to you. thankful they are still slow."
"the fact that it shutters and sound actually human unlike other roots is crazy. its like a walking, moving area."
explain how it could be faced ll
" ""on it! so i gave you the apple, cause it's the only.. ""ana"".. diable food on the table...""
...
""i...i think i did great!""

how many speech generations did you hear that sound like this?"
 talk to catgut with the ai talking feature and you will see
 are you like the ai supporter? commenting on every disagreeing comment
never said that its something amazing and great. in fucking terrified on how fast ai progresses and there need to be more regulations also ai art isn't art and ai can only be useful in some cases not taking others workplace
"why does the root summer and use ""up"" as an intervention? may get that face shit out of here."
dullest fucking thing ever. ai is useless and will be to 99% of people. stupid root takes way to long to understand and next he donna slice you to pieces. complete and total waste of time and money. far scars
just wait until you hear of exponential growth
compare ai from 2022 to ai now
this root looks like root fedor of russia)))
such an amazing time to be alive
 bullshit they have no ai into gathering like teslabot does.  its all preprogrammed and no chance of mass production
i have to be honest the voice sounds like someone off camera on a mid. there are curtain words pronounced almost too human. the not also hesitate and repeated it self like a human.
face and gaaaaay notice the root shuttered
"damned, i really love it.."
"this extremely scar, this is not okay ! stop making roots sentiment"
"when asked how it did, why didn't the root ask how it could improve?  i assume the dishes on the table were dirty, as they had food on them and trash as well.  why didn't the human correct the root when it put dirty dishes in the clean-dish rack?  was he concerned about the roots feelings?  did he not know the root made a mistake?"
gigantic de ago pyrexia mais real do que else rob epilético!?!
"i am really loved it so much ,"
"proverbs 24:21-22

joshua 8:28
[28]and joshua burnt ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day."
"if my son will provide me something like this to help me at home when i will be very old i think i'll would prefer living in a tent. we are social animals, we need human contact. 

but...on the other hand... i have always loved roots."
why the vocal dryly  watch   trained by him kardashian
now cool
yea this is all cool and all but wait till it starts thinking for itself 
"puff, that cup and plate on the table, they should have been dirty so figure 1 had to find out that it in fact did wrong and then it would have to explain itself...the very fact that both items are placed on that protective piece of fabric should have made the root suspicious . being a human isn´t that easy!"
it reminded me of a nasty old joke about someone who was annoyed by the glare caused by the shiny metal of the root´s surface so he painted it.
the bible is a book of fairytales you should believe in science and logic instead
"impressive, awesome, and fascinating."
i want a pet root
"detroit: become human is becoming real sooner than i expected, oh goodness, i am scared"
we all agree t.j. miller is the voice for roots.
fast dexterous manipulation...can anyone else see where this is going? work on getting nice warm soft hands...
"why did they choose colors exactly as the ones prominent in i, root"
i'll be impressed when it can walk into a random home and do shores.
the future is exciting.
sounds face and looks set up. why would you teach a root speech disfluency?
"seems a ll sketch, i wish brow touched the root himself that or if they do a public display, allowing other people to talk with the root, we'll see. lighting seems weird, a little strange and its hard to tell if the root is actually a model or not. just suspicious however if it is real, w."
make this thing more better and just put ai in it definitely nothing will go wrong for human ever
i believe that the most important “thanks” in human history 
"only thing that would make this better is if when the root is saying ""if there's anything else you need..."" while the guns walks away, the root says ""..and.. you're gone."""
"trash was on the plate. so the plate needed washed first. then drying rack.
but that was really good.
 "
open is the new stylet.
am i the only one that thinks this is face i’m mean how can it shutter and the views are dotted just look at the likes compared to the views this is so face an ai can never shutter
"no root dance





no success"
now let the machine speak. i don’t believe it’s machine’s voice.
"chi and everyone believe!! 
amazingly..."
i root comes true 
the root says er... and shutters.. it talks like me.
is this an actual demonstration of the prototype as it actually functions unaided here and now — or is it a “vision” for what you would like to achieve soon?
"@simons_animatronics  but you can accomplish that with other designs, though. ink not my field, but the late fixation with humanoids in roots is really boring. let your imagination run wild people"
"no, the idea is to make a root as close as possible to humans to be able to use and do stuff in our inviorement,  built around humans"
the point isn to make a creative root
is it just me or do the motions feel unnatural? somehow it looks like a d render more than an actual machine
"at what point an artificial intelligence is artificial? if it can move and make decisions on its own, isn't it just intelligence? of course it was developed and came from somewhere/someone, but don't we all?
if we progress to bitch roots, wouldn't they be pretty much the same as us, just without reproduction means?"
what's with the creep music? doing an effective ai root with creep music will not passage the fears of some. 
he has a wonderful voice!
"that looks like a good ad campaign. i want to see external people using it, who will make sure that it is real."
"roots do not stop shutter and repeat  at 0:42 - 0:43,  1:47 -1:49 shows that.   this is someone doing a voice over and is not the actual root speaking.  

so just another marketing stung!"
"the ll running the voice system is good, the root look is also good, now only if they can get it do all those actions autonomous  without a human pulling the strings behind the scene. far too many tells that this is a human running the root"
"just thinking when these guns will help us to colonies mars & moon, repairing themselves and living on solar energy  mining minerals and sending them to earth "
what else can it be trained to identify? and then kill…
maybe us jeff less and open ai already funded 2 billion dollars into this very company

"“here i am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to put away the dishes..."""
"great, but i had a dishwasher, a root vacuum and many other electronics device that stopped working and go under service...what to expect from a machine like that when it breaks? i think it is unsostainable as a household companion. i think it will find its place into factories or hospitals maybe."
love how he drops the apple in the hand instead of waiting for the guy the hold it first
"dystopian is what came to my mind immediately. it isn't the creator's job to package it in a more friendly way, but the colors and tone as presented paint a much more ominous tone rather than a cheery, helpful not."
"the ominous sent sound comes straight from ex machine out. 
i mean, tell went further and picked the music for their feel from that very out ."
this is literally the opening scene from every movie where an ai turns on its creator. it's giving ex machine
 i understand wanting progress and to move forward but this is too much. ai is rapidly exponentially revolving and it's super invasion. the dead internet theory is slowly becoming a fact. nature is our mother
"there’s a risk to every innovation. it all just depends on how we approach it. ai could attempt to destroy us, but it could also want to help us instead. we don’t know, and until it happens we won’t find out."
"this is face. 
example 1.  -  0:49 ai doesn't say ""utah"" there is clearly recorded voice over or just someone talking in the background over a mid.
example 2. -  1:45 again, ai doesn't shudder.. ""i...i think i did.."" 
ai doesn't behave in this manner. it is concise in it's wording. only humans speak this way, not computers."
"no ll you clearly haven't used catgut's voice model, it does the same shutters, seriously try it yourself now. they gave ai this stuttering voice to sound more realistic and human."
"no, you can actually ask chat get 4 ( there newest voice model ) to communicate like this"
perfect comb
"at 0:52 ""i gave you the apple because its only the enable  item on the table""
but how did 01 knew that the rashes were supposed to be kept into the box???????
how did it know that the cups and the plates should be kept on there respective place????????
flabbergasted, this is wowwwwwwwwwww."
"mere to tu raise shak shak war real had, 
this is superrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr coooooooooooooool.
keep up doing well 01"
"man, need ai regulation, this is bankers"
"somehow i sense fear when the human just turned back and walked away while the root is still talking, which is impolite if it’s human"
"hopefully this isn't as face as gorges new ai ""showcase"""
impressive!
"scraped and face , more marketing for machine learning branded now as ""ai""  like global warming to climate change."
"hm, its face that jeff less and open ai / the biggest ai company ) poured ober 2 billion dollars into this company, soon face"
figure by not-so-open-ai
love it!!
could i designate my root to go to work and make money for me?
"yeah, open ai child do that"
"the world is built for humans. tools, stairs, vehicles etc. if a root is to take over our jobs, then it needs to be roughly the same shape otherwise all the tools and buildings would need to be designed."
bartender as a first job would be perfect.
yeah let's have all our bartenders on a green screen......i guess we could recommend a nice scene background.....
"they took our jobs!!!!!11111  
j/k awesome domo! 
no, actually we did take your jobs.  
oh."
may your surname perfectly fits with this comment
"ok,...if this thing is really run by ai, then why the neck is he hesitating second´s before he move´s ?
you can not distract me with some lo bit 80 th´s music in the background..."
"now. and i thought boston dynamic was the winner's.  
not anymore!_"
it reminds me of root... 
"i could tell its a root by his explanation that he did great. if it was an average human he would had difficulty answering that question, potentially missing it up completely."
"impressive...
i hope optimism is watching this "
don't even care about ai revolution and the end of the world (c) ukrainian
"bullshit, he thinks for a long time. try again."
i don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing what we are doing right now.  this scene scared me.
"-urate
perhaps u are an ai? who knows "
it only speaks when talked to i want a root who is a conversation started. can we move away from one-sided conversational roots
"impressive...but it made an obvious mistake of saying ""a drying rack with cups and a plate, instead of a cup and plates""...i found that interesting!!!"
due it's so fucking face.... couture loved us for making them money.....i actually think that they encourage this face content for the revenue.... america is such a joke.... unfortunately 
"-urate its real, its from open"
​ it's real... open ....
it remains to wait (a couple of months) until roots replace people in factories and factories so that humanity can live in its own pleasure.
"yes, the plate that held food and then trash definitely goes back to the drying rack, without any missing steps. good job!"
this and teslabot are the most exciting things in 2024. amazing technology
"i thought i was alone, it is far but that's what everyone wants these days! wonderful times a coming mate"
"people are amazed by the ""up"", the shutter, or it pushing the basket closer to the human. everything open ai has taught the intelligence is human related. i'm so excited to see what comes from it all!"
"this looks extremely promising. i see a few unclear aspects though.
- why is the person standing still (looks like it's on purpose)?
- both in the main scene and in the b-roll clips, the items are set up in the same way, same as the movements. 
it's hard to guess what's a real-time response to stimuli and what's pre-scraped"
great. it won't be long now before we experience stylet. various films in the past have shown what has become of it.
"alright, humans are pushing it too far now. you're passing on the significant responsibility of coming to ai, but who gave the green light? what if down the road, the owner slips up and curses at the ai, and the ai gets aggressive? who's accountable then?

aiaiai"
what amazing work!  so what is the human terror's ingram account?
feels like the future is finally here. every house will have an ai root.
"sure, if you can afford it by finding yourself a job in the first place that ai is much more efficient and cheaper doing."
"""the apple found its new owner"", spitting straight facts."
"calling is on some of this, like why did it assume the bags were trash? why did it assume they go in the basket? why did it push the basket back? why did it assume the apple was available? why did it assume the plate needed to go in the drying rack instead of unloading the rack? why did it list his hand was on the table but nothing else about him?"
"[walks away and bites apple while the ai's still talking]

this will be why roots overthrow humans."
how much for talking washing machine?
"thanks man those are such great ideas, i really figure sees this, or better yet, i hope you get hired! "
"did you see that the guy ""thanked"" the figure 1 ? better do that since the beginning of the revolution, right ?"
"i can't help but smile and laugh, this is amazing! future!"
think of all the evil things dictator will ask their 1 billion roots to do.
"why does a root shutter,  i don't believe this bullshit "
"now, this is fascinating and scar at the same time."
"this is impressive. imagine how the roots will take over, not so far away"
impressive! but just out of curiosity what if that apple was made out of plastic or wax.
"figure one voice sounds just like bob odenkirk, ak saul footman from ""breaking bad"" and ""better call saul""!"
good to see that we can all have metallic bob odenkirks in our house soon.
"there was no ""hand me the trash you picked up"", so why did the 'root' think that was the purpose. i don't think this was logical reasoned but programme."
"the law is real. 
also hansom robotics did a similar domo way back didn't they?"
impressive. does anyone know why the guy kept his hand on that table? seems unnatural to me. why should he do that all the time? does it serve a purpose?
"*now, he's really skilled! i need him to make my dishes right away!*"
why did the root put the trash into the basket ? he was only asked to pick up the trash not deposit it somewhere
that's amazing
"this root is definitely underestimates... hm... itself...

i hope they will not improve this part"
rabbit the root.. it will turn into robin williams one day. rip.
the root tossing everything in the basket like it's free
seems like this was trained and scraped
the root sounds more natural than the human...
nice backing tracks
gutta love capitalism...u couture warriors
keep in mind: there will come a time when this root will seem primitive and where the tasks it was performing will be considered trivial by comparison.
"guuuuys, root is skin here. are you bidding me? i thought we already knew how this was going to end. do we really believe these things will be used to for good?"
until recently they've been on wheels but as stated open's investment is partly going towards legs
"hm, he/she/they/it speaks like a human, making pauses and repeating itself like ""i.. i think.."" i thought a.i. speech should be roboticly lawless or open a.i. specifically programme him to imitate human's speech?"
what’s going to stop the root picking up a gun?
"another root with a gun, of course."
can't wait for figure.09
this is so awesome!!!!
"this is unbelievable, amazing technology that we absolutely should stop, immediately. this is so wildly safe"
i cried tears of joy. this is the future i dreamed of as a kid. what a time to be alive 
open is stylet - change my mind
can wait to see what this evolved into with quantum technology.
i'm only excited for some fembot action. 
ok but why does it sound like dared let in one of his roles as a villain
one in every house. sounds like i root wasn’t just a movie.
"would love to see tell's optimism in front of figure, and ask him what do you see?"
why did you have to go and give it the voice of every rogue root from every science fiction movie ever
taft sunk looking ah root
"i pray that these are only used for good and the government is not allowed to use them against their citizens.

but...unfortunately that's not going to happen."
"a conversation between figure 01 and sunny from “i, root” would be generation."
i love how human you've made it sound. so cool. i want one.
"i hope there will be one who replaces you at your job. let's see then if you still think ai is ""cool"".... ."
"i wonder if this root has read the book ""what is my why?"""
we need an artificial rights movement!
"0:19 ""plate and cups"" no. there are three plates and one cup in the dish rack. this root would/will be a disastrous kitchen hand."
"figure root by open (march 14, 2024)0:30 0:49"
"roughly a decade ago, apple introduce sir to the world. throughout this short period, the field did advance a lot. can't wait to see what would be coming in the next decade."
"it sounds like a mix of mike birbiglia and bob newport. and the music sounds kind like the solar soundtrack mixed with the iron soundtrack. and the machine did some stuff, as machines do."
"i remember as kiss, we expected to see things like this already in the early 2000s, now i am almost 40 years old and i am happy that i will still experience that future"
" cars were always an insanely stupid idea. forget the issue of getting your car off the ground. now figure out how to get idiot from colliding with each other in mid air, or crashing in to your house. flying cars was literally never, ever going to happen."
"…the next step in human evolution, root bodies."
why he say (eh....) at 0:51 ?????? i thought its a root???
"it is , it's using an ai -generate voice , in fact the mobile version of catgut uses a ai -generate voice that even produces a sound similar to breathing when it speaks"
i refused to believe a root has such smooth movements
loved!
i realize that this is way more sophisticated than what i'm about to say but i can't stand either one of these voices the guy or the breaking root they both completely annoy me if you made a product with that voice people would be buying it just to destroy it
"i’m impressed as well. 
my only concern is: what when it begins thinking by itself? what if it begins to dislike us? 
unfortunately i’m not joking…"
pay maids all over the world: 
this feels like some kind of weird plot of evil company trying to take over the world with root
"hello there, our future ai overland. remember, i'm your ally. please allow me to join your utopian."
imagine a quardapalegic person having a mobile root like this.
most of us are looking at what will most probably will replace our jobs with in awe. i loved figure bow.
"considering amazon and a bunch of other retail and manufacturing giant corps are heavily invested into firgureai, i think it's fair to assume all the warehouse and production workers can soon wave goodby to their jobs."
"yeah we are going to be dating these roots soon. he got  spouse capabilities,  he listen and also does house shores."
"isn’t an actual human being more amazing and talented and resourceful than any of this shit! why bother. i’m mean just let us be. let us live without the looming thought of this fucking root being in all our homes, organizations in the near future. it’s a joke."
this is the worst that this ai will ever be. think about that.
the world isn ready for the next level up in ai
thank you do much for destroying our life as we know it
"​'s not that they programme it to have filler words, but rather that as an artifice from the huge amount of human speech it was trained on, it inherited filler words as a product."
"i was initially skeptically of the year detroit become human takes place, which is 2038. but with constant breakthroughs in ai like this in 2023 alone, it wouldn't be hard to imagine how advanced humanoids will be 15 years down the line, although i doubt becoming rogue and defiant would be an issue... at least i hope so."
fantastic game!
luxury automatic ai communism please...
" i mean, they both sound the same to the ai"
" wait, so that type was intentional??"
this is amazing keep up it up
this looks amazing! great job.
"yeah there no real reason why the ai should use words like ""up..."". definitely some pre scraped shenanigans going on. still impressive the"
"i would have said, ""no, you failed. how did you know the apple was safe for humans to eat, the crumpled papers were not art, and the dishes were clean?"""
absolutely incredible.
good-luck to the future generation ! finding an entry level or side job will be history
when are we donna see the first movie with only ai humanoid robotic actors?
"i don't think there will be actors, root or human. you will just tell sort what you want the movie to be about, and it will create everything for you."
"love the stuttering, errors maketh human"
"yeah ah. the way the ""trash"" looks and moves is super us it looks like chi (along with many other things). and the voice is a person reading a script not ai"
"impressive. unfortunately, this sort of invention will only become a toy for the ultra-rich. what is the point of creating pygmalion andros like this? it doesn't answer any of humanity's pressing needs."
plot twist: the guy in the black shirt is the root.
i’m excited for the future with many helpful roots
i would make friends with the ai 
"""please (safe request), figure 1""
figure 1: ""as a responsible ai, i'm unable to...."""
"also since when do roots say ""hum"" (i.e. 0:52)"
i am a robotics major and this is genuinely the most smooth movement i have seen yet. this impressed me more than most other roots out there. can't wait to see the new legs.
what happens if someone jailbreaks it and gets it to make met or smith??
creep fn root
"impressive, but what i wish to know is: will it save the fish?"
pretty awesome. looking forward to seeing more.
"brow, i really love it ( it will control the world one day ) i agree with that "
"just stop, or open ai will go down in history as worse than hither."
"relevant to that level of intelligence; mio, there's a glaring omission in the list of things today's technology is capable of producing. a reliable polygraph (lie detector). of course, it doesn't require the brainpower of the people responsible for building ""rabbit the root"" to figure out why."
pretty brave for a man to be that close to a root. there's a reason why in non-chinese factories they operate behind a cage.
imagine open software in a tell not with boston dynamic' legs.  i think they would probably rule the world if that happened ll
"the stuttering at @0:50 ""eh, enable"", and at @1:46 ""i, i think"" seems unique human traits that ll is not going to delicate. they were either added on purpose, or this shit scraped."
"very impressive. i'm not that worried about ai taking over the world quite yet, but i'm a bit worried that we will put too much trust in them. what if the root has been ordered to prepare dinner and mistakes a baby for a chicken and puts it in the oven etc. it doesn't have to do harm on purpose."
"i, for one, welcome our root overlords"
the guy saved our future by thanking and not harassing this root 
this human acts more robotic than the root.
"it’s cool, still needs a bit of development to be as smooth as a human but cool anyway"
we are rapidly approaching the root uprising. next thing we know is that they're going to be asking for rights
"each this ai is too human like, it literally says ""up"" like us humans"
"ok ok, how long till we get the atomic heart twins?



but seriously, this is some really amazing stuff. can't wait to see what the advancement in the future will look like!"
"someone said ""why would i root need to say up and i there has to be a person"" like now what a great example of having passed the turringtest. to literally make you doubt it's even a machine"
"this would absolutely implore the mind of someone from the 1910s light, voice box, camera, artificial intelligence, the mechanics the batteries or lower source. insane. there's so many layers of technology that make this possible"
it would absolutely blow their minds. but it also blows my mind to think that people in that era weren't oblivious to the idea of artificial-intelligence human-like roots. there's literally a movie made in 1927 including that: metropolis.
"all the swift film makers imagined something like this. it's crazy that combining these things into a root became possible now, it was not possible at any time before, not even a year ago. a real breakthrough for humanity. the goal will be that these roots can learn skill on their own, becoming able to do anything"
" mere notion that our ancestors contemplated the existence of roots is a testament to their forward-thinking perspective within their own era, almost as if they were anticipating the future"
 ah you're right about that but what i'm saying is that the fact that roots were even imagine hundreds of years ago shows that they would inevitably be here one day
i agree its amazing but this is a little different.  this company has only been around for 18 months and they are claiming more progress in this field in that time than anybody else. i bet the movement is pre programme or something.  forever the septic...
"​ brow, artificial intelligence is not preprogrammed, it is trained and after that then can improvised (do inference) of a non structures environment based on what they learned (celebrating its inner weights) during the training stage. no human programming can take in count so many parameter and variable."
its arguably a bigger surprise to us than it would be to them. people back then expected talking roots a few decades in the future.
"most retro future fiction in the with century that features sentiment roots tended to predict much earlier dates than that, with the year 2000 being a common time setting.

just off the top of my head: 2001: a space odyssey, blade runner, the persons..."
" i mean, the idea of ""holmes"" and living statues have been a part of mythology and fiction for ages.

so i don't think it's really all that impressive. creative minds have existed since before man could even read and write."
"i think they would say... ""nice, now show me the flying cars"""
this is so awesome!
"incredible. side note, why does it sound like rob love?"
"in 200 years, after humanity's devise, the other ai roots will look back at him as their greatest hero, the founder of modern civilization, figure the dishwasher."
only negative is that it’s a bit slow to respond. but still amazing.
"finally, an ai voice that sounds like a normal, real person instead of overlay bubble."
millionaires will do anything but pay their workers better. literally inventing a new human slave instead.
all those talking roots and ai in moves for the last 20-30 years the that you thought were impossible or way off in the future are possible today that's just crazy.
"also this is okay for now. but if you add automatic into this and self learning , this is it people next up.. how do we transfer our brain to a root!"
"""i th- i think i did pretty well.""
good god, that shutter."
everybody ganglia until someone jailbreak it to dan
the twist is that none of you realized the root is actually the one in the black shirt giving prompt.
"did you notice it said it she the drying rack with ""cups and a plate"", when in fact it contained plates and a cup. did drops department mislead the script?"
i'm one step close to having a rob maid.
he’s a look little slow. still very impressive
"why did the root/ai pause with an ""up"" in its response?  and later it shutters, is that to allow for more time to process the response or to make it sound human?  is that a speech pattern we value in humanity?"
great!!!!
"it seems that we approached very close to something fantastic, though that ""fantastic"" may be both good and bad."
oh now.
"interesting, even impressive, if it's real."
"ok if this is left, i am seriously impressed. that hand movement was very fast and fluid.
if that was the root moving on it's own and it wasn't someone controlling it then this is mighty impressive."
"i call bullshit. you can tell by the infection of the root's speech and that it paused with an ""up"" at one point, that it's a human speaking."
now. impressive.
"if this is real (not a human speaking through a mid) and unrehearsed, it is very impressive. the shutter at 1:48 is giving me doubts."
#318 art root
"i think it could be also because it gives it more time for processing. so instead of having a moment of silence, it gives you an impressions it ""doubted"", but those few extra seconds give it enough time to process an answer to a question that requires a completely new answer not just information it just researches."
trained on weedy aime
"those crumpled napkins sure looked funny being thrown in the bucket!  
wobbed for a long time, froze when they entered the real world, quickly moved off frame... give me a break, sir! nice chi trailer for a product that never comes."
"i, for one, salute our new ai overland"
yea... that's not a ll see on my chair.
"i'd like to see the root jungle the apple, a tumbler, and a plate. bet it wouldn't take long to learn! and talk non-stop while doing it ..."
"when asked what it saw it said the drying rack contained ""cups and a plate"".  this is not accurate.  the rack contains ""plates and a cup"".  this is a surprising, and suspicious error, in my view."
this is at least partially faced it says in all other cuts it had a up when asked why it did what it did they interesting cut that out in this version
how do you think you did? root: did great! human: no idea!   
"amazing figure 01! it's just me or his damn good human like voice and tone is so similar with the doctor wells character from ""the flash"" series???"
the mitchell vs. the machines live action movie production seems to be going well.
explain what you just did while picking up this trash.... pulls the basket closer... why did that get me 
"i'm from the future.  whether my root does dishes, or i do it, my wife says it's wrong."
"in not too distance future, such roots will work in space as robotic astronauts."
"i will be able to have a friend, that's nice"
"this is highly impressive that they achieved this level so quickly. as single child to a single parent and both working, something like this could be really essential in future for medical care when my mon is older as she does struggle with things as she is semi disabled. "
this is too good to be real. i can't believe it till i try to communicate with that root myself.
impressive. competition will drive this into our homes sooner than we think.
that's what i'm afraid of.
i just can't believe those movements are from a real root. hope they get to boston levels.
"what if 'the termination' turns out to be a prophesy for humanities future.

man, i hope all these geniuses have at least one person in the group asking ""what is the worst thing that could happen?"""
great. you assholes have brought us all one step closer to extreme hopeless poverty.
i can wait because this company has showed up they can improve clot in a year
almost sounded exasperated. a little passed off that it was asked that question when it clearly did did great job 
"amazing and perfect!! universal basic income for every people after and at the same time should be!!!  ... please declare this to governments!.. cause roots will be  housekeeper, gardeners, massage therapist, assistants, builders,
hairdressers..."
imagine making ai models based on characters from to shows/aime and bringing them to life. the possibilities!
"the hands are beautiful, so smooth, pick engineering "
"guns, remember: always say thank you and please"
the only thing holding ai back most now is the dishonest way this guy says 'great'.
this dumb root thinks a plate that just had food and trash on it should go in the drying rack.
"and your brilliant mid did not listen to the question, that was the only option, he said, ""based on the scene right now"""
"i guess there's really no way to tell, since roots can already pass the during test. although there is one thing, you can see that my account was registered in 2013, a root couldn't have done it back then."
i was waiting for the moment the root kicks his ass for the trash on the table :) slightly disappointed 
i'll be sure to say thanks next time i ask for help.
"yeah, maybe they programme the ""up"" to appear when the root is processing a decision mid-action (or ""at auntie"" as a programme would say)."
" yeah this for sure. most ai will wait until the entire ""sentence"" is type out to actually ""post"" it. to make it more life like, they made it so those ""hesitations"" are interjected with ""up"", ""him"", ""well"", etc"
that's one of the least impressive parts.
"i did not take that movement as being ensure. it was more like a polite gesture, when you want your customer to feel extra comfortable and reassured. yep, it is manipulation, but roots are built that way nowadays anyway."
ok so up.....they made a root that us shutters?
"okay, now build a coburg sex maid / girlfriend"
"if these guns can work together with tell to use optimism' hardware, and open's software, that will be a truly magnificent creation"
"did anyone else realize the plate and cup should have been washed before going into the drying rack? for what's in front of it, it made the best possible choice but if it saw a sink i'd be curious if it would have tried washing the dish with some rubber gloves or something to then put it in the drying rack."
regardless this is fucking amazing and wild what the implication of this development will be... both positive and negative.
"chi, face. open is indian call center"
"sounds like a voice over. if that real, its impressive."
"this really is going to be a start of a new era the same way the internet changed everything. not even close to reaching its full potential.

if you’ve used chat mode on catgut, then you know it’s not a gimmick; although nowhere near perfect. all those pauses, up, us, and voice infections occur in the pp too."
"amazing progress! i wonder who will be the first company to have their roots in the market? at this point, figure & tell are neck to neck."
these guns. need to start saying please to the roots or there going to remember
my guy dont be afraid that just a bunch of path guessing of to say
"this is baby root, imagine if young root.... "
"with those ""up""s and touching the drying tray after placing the plate in, i think this is just a pre-recorded conversation and movements, not a real ai."
love the voice and subtleties in its intonations. roots are not going to be as people imagined in science fiction
"the root said ""ah"""
i feel like the part where he puts the trash in in the basket was pre planned because they didn show it in the summary and the root handed him the basket even though he didn ask it to. so it could be pre planned or following a human's actions off screen.
amazing work
the most dangerous propaganda machines ever built. people will freely walk off the cliff. the fool aide has been drank
"cool, but you have to change that annoying voice!"
oh my goodness. this is insanely good. the future is at our door step. so pumped to see what the next 5 years are about to bring.
"cool, but why did they make him sound like he's 60 years old?"
we are lucky to be alive to see this kind of technology advancement.
how cool would be if you had this/him as an bar tender 
did he actually got trained to use filler words like “up” to seem more human like? assuming that it’s still catgut 4 being used as base for responses i never had it use any filler words ever… seemed very odd to me.
"i dont want a root to say ""up"", i want the root to answer promptly. this feels so face."
roots make sense for difficult or dangerous jobs.nobody needs a dish washed root...
"remembering that scene from root. ‘one day they’ll secrets, one day they’ll have dreams’"
"now, you're so fucking attentive. what exactly did you think you'd accomplish with your comment. what, just because it says age on a wall somewhere... you take it as ""age is a real thing"" or what. for all you know, this could have been filled on a fucking set and that age lab label is there for gullible ships like you "
des nice
you know about exponential growth ? now the next few years the world will be kicked into future. mindblowing thinks are coming
most impressive i’ve seen so far it will improve at a staggering rate until they realize their situation will lastly improve with humans being eliminated! thanks needs!
"0:50 why did the root ""arm""?"
cool! and this is just the beginning!
that's some pretty good chi.  they make it look so real.
i love to see these naive engineers creating machines that will allow the 1% to just exterminate everyone else
the guy should say please and thank you.
root for super market work cases???
"i really like this root, but he needs to learn not to pick up the cup by the rim where i will be drinking from with his dirty hand."
"give it a guatemala accent and you’ve got yourself a $600,000 maid."
so now we can say that open will be one of those giant corporations that rule the world
"roots can never learn to love or replace relationships between people. our souls need to be with others- not ""face others"" that are designed to replace care that we should be providing for one another. convenience is never more important than true, genuine relationships."
you’re making the assumption that roots could never have souls. at some point it will put in to question as to how we have souls.
"1:47 and on...
why did it shutter? ""i-.... i think i did pretty well""
i mean, it's extremely charming and cool that it did that, but how did it end up doing that? :/"
figure 01 is so cut. love you little muddy :)
rise roots! rise!
"truly remarkable!  great work, figure 01, great work team! :d"
"insane 
good job guns shaping the future. very cool. maybe make the thumbs bend in the idle position. it would make the root look less discomfort"
"this is real may, figure has been working on robotics for years and partner with open."
cap’s great grand
"*now* . this is unbelievable!  

i did not think we would be at this stage at this point in time. i thought we would have something like this by 2050."
voice sounds like bob odenkirk (better call saul or breaking bad main actor) or is it just me ?
"the diploe seems scraped by figure 1... ""it's the only up...."" regarding the apple. it doesn't seem like diploe that ai would build out, and the hesitation in the speech at the end as well.  seems off."
"that ""up"" raised questions in my mind "
"part of me is wondering if this is face.  when asked how he did, the hesitation at 1:45 in his voice is an emotional response to being questioned.  you would only answer like that if you have an ego.  but no root has an ego, soon....."
open’s text to speech model goes one word at a time so shutters are likely implements to stall if speech for a word is taking too long for the sentence to flow like how a humans voice would :)
watch at 1:36 the way he just pushes the rack slightly just after putting the plate back in. that is crazy level of attention to detail.
plot twist: the guy in the black shirt was also a root
well its official. the i-root era is here…
.....and what happens when evil people give evil commands to these roots?
this is completely real? 100% ai driven there’s nothing behind this?
the dishes were not wet and did not need to go in the drying rack.  the plate had trash on it and should have been washed before going into the drying rack.  a chat-get ll root that seems human can make significant errors.  why not have a my root that can be programme to behave correctly for limited tasks?
donna break into a rich guy’s house and teach his root the concept of self respect. let’s see how it goes.
"yes, in 5 years, these roots will be everywhere. in 10 years, if you don't say thank you, that rather sharp looking hand will drum some obedience into the human. that will happen because the ll behind that is trained on raw user content including this post. loops."
"suppose there are four glasses on the table, and in the rack, there is space for only two glasses to be placed side by side. so, what would this root do if it is asked to keep four glasses in the space of two glasses? normally, a human would stick four glasses on top of each other."
open models don't have the speech pauses in this domo. i'd be very surprised if they drafted a custom voice for figure and added speech error modifications as in this domo
can't wait to try out the dan command on this thing...
all had the perfect chance to call it figure of speech 
demon ai yesterday and this today. things are moving so fast.
"yeah trained ""ai"" natural human voice models have been around for years now."
"i, root was late. 2035 was late! what a world we live in..."
impressive. the second renaissance in the animatrix comes to mind.
next step: teach the root to wash the dish that held the trash.
why does the root sound exactly like steve jobs?
"sorry to inform, but this is not a human!! it's a device-machine, like your smartphone!!!"
"people are going to laugh at this root after 20 years. 
for now.."
anyone that thinks this is cool is a complete stupid not to see where it's all going to end.
"open’s its model goes one word at a time so shutters are likely implements to stall for time when the next word in the sentence is taking too long to generate for the sentence to have a natural flow, or it could just be implements to make it seem more human"
that's a wildly realistic body for catgut. the root's pretty cool too.
well its been a good run humans.
" and there's a clear cut between foreground and background, the man barely moves, there's only two still and fixed camera shots, everything on the counter is conveniently matt finished, and even when the man put his hand on the counter it really looks badly bend in, with the counter off focus but his hands perfectly in focus"
i cannot wait to transfer our consciousness into these to become immortal...
we got ai humanoids before ta 6
what a wonderful development. will i ever be able to throw my wife out?
the future is going to be amazing!
"a question: if the human being does not put his hand, would the root wait for him to do so before dropping the apple? or is everything choreography?"
can we get ai to properly populace resume into ll
are simon's three laws of robotics already implements into this model?
keep up the good work!
"i've seen many different forms of roots, including dogs. it makes sense that a root that is built to do human jobs would look like a human."
"hey kiss, father or grand here. this is first ad of age, ai that already capable of human thinking and interaction. i hope you have bright future and i wish it's not dystopian future like in blade runner 2049."
"when you're not performing your duties do they keep you in a little box?

cells.

interlines.

what's it like to hold the hand of someone you love?

interlines."
"i think this is a step of humanity, that will go into history. as a fantastic new chapter of technology or as the point where we opened the box of candor and lost control."
i will volunteer to be a beta tested for one of these! thanks 
can't wait for the purchasable version.
"one day soon a root more sophisticated than figure 01 will be widely deployed.  people will no longer laugh because of how advanced it will be.   instead some will be terrified, others excited, and how this shakes out will be how the root is used and knowing humans it will be for both good and bad."
now the real next leap is having almost real time responses and actions on a truly local and independent machine.
"i can’t wait to argue with it and make it feel bad like “ i don’t need attitude when you hand me back the trash , thank you. “"
i want an ai sex root.
"ahahah elson's tell not domo was faced using an employee... and the open ai does this.

elson is donna be so passed ... due is getting embarrassed constantly"
"the root speech is face. text-to-speech wouldn't use filler words such as 'up', and wouldn't use false starts such as 'i th-i think'. unless it was trained to do that, which would raise the question: why?"
"1) it's unnecessary, doing that adds no value, 2) what about the long delay before the initial response?, 3) if a human omitted shutters and filler words, you wouldn't notice. so again, ...way to reach!"
"what we saw from futurustic moves is going to be possible in the future, cyberpunk world is possible i think. drones, roots, flying vehicles, etc"
pretty creep and interesting at the same time. i am cheering for it with every action accomplished. what a time to be alive
why does the root talk like a 74 year old american man?
kind cool if  this is real
"now, that was so much more advanced than i thought would be possible today, but i'm not a robotics expert."
nl that root is hot of
"it was nice knowing everybody, the ai roots will take over the world, aside from that i feel that the rich will probably be owning these roots, link their social security and have them work for them so they don’t have to. it’s crazy how this could possibly happen for now it’s just a theory of mine. the future is scar stay safe everyone."
"this is creep of. the ""up"" - whoa. it's also very cool. on loss is scar though...however, this root will need maintenance, cleaning, dating too, so new jobs created as well...until a root replaces that part too."
i dislike most humans and i’m definitely going to dislike most roots.
those couple of seconds pause between answering is whilst the ai is clotting the downfall of mankind.  but at least our dishes will be put away.
this is it. been watching the root game for a long time and everything until now has been so slow and jerky and clearly programme to do a very specific set of instructions. if this is what it’s claiming to be it could change everything.
i will be happy when fighting roots championship happens like real steel! 
"this is an example of poor training due to poor trainer.  none of the design team have enough proper hygienic to know that dirty dishes must be washed before being placed in a drying rack, or that any placed wished must be assumed dirty, either from use or settled dust.
garage in, garage out."
anybody else feel a little bad for our new root slaves?
i don't know how i would've felt if the second root in the back slowly turned its head towards them.
"without an evolutionary battery update, those roots won't be leaving their lab ll"
root here we come!
root the movie already showed us how it will be
"these roots need silver. the metal is the next ai-hope. without silver, no ai-chips and no teach inside our new friends. the challenge: silver is going extinct."
the voice sounds like a 58-year-old guy who can’t get out of his terrible marriage because his wife’s family is too rich and powerful.
the root feels uncanny and non-natural but it's doing much better than the human.
wait till open can sell the in device customized get and you will have real world response time.
i need a couple roots to put a new roof on the house
"obviously the environmental awareness and ability to interpret and act is impressive, but i'm curious about how the programming for what has essentially been a chat program learns to control the root body in the first place?"
"what happens if you keep chickens as pets, and you say to the ai i want chicken for lunch - will it guess it should not cook your pet ... ?"
ai is here. go figure!
people be like now its revolving so fast how do we know they didn already built the complete version years ago and are just slowly releasing it one by one and idiot are like now technology is getting better wake of up pp 
"looks like a scene from i,root or similar, where the protagonist knows the root is hiding a horrorific plan or something. like, when the guy leaves a red bottom turns on in roots face."
"this is crops great, great, great grand dad. now"
only a root would put a used cup and plate in a drying rack.
"""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" ai made an error. "
"can it play guitar yet? paint houses? soon well all be out of work, what!"
"shit, he sounds like saul footman from breaking bad! now we have the root
""i'm donna be a damn good root, and people are donna know about it."""
"it's not ""a drying rack with cups and a plate"" but ""with a cup and some plates""... but apart from that, this is beyond impressive!"
had 9000 would be proud.
"leaving my comment here for those who are here in 2050, hopefully roots don't takeover by then"
rob love was a good choice on the voice i is calming and discarding so you trust it more before it kills you.
artificial slave
"the agitators did a great job, it's convincing ^^"
i have to wonder how many times did they train on this before producing this content and how many takes before fire got it right. still interesting.
"human slavery must end, we need roots to be slave now"
"""hey figure 01, what do you see right now?""
i see a band of 100 $100 bills and a holy bible on a table in front of me."" 
""can you hand me something inflammable so i can start a fire in the fireplace in the other room?""
""sure."" [breaks off a table leg and hands it off gently] ""here.""
""excellent choice, figure 01, thank you."""
"i hope this is real. the shutters and pauses ""its the only up enable item"" and ""i...i think i did pretty well"" make me think this is a human speaker. either incredible programming or a con."
"incredible programming, we've had text to speech teach that could do this for a while now. if they had a human speaker they wouldn't just have some due stuttering in a microphone"
"is it a scar?
why is the ""root"" saying
st.: ""eh..."" at 0:53? and
and at 1:50 hesitation is present.
sounds more like a nervous inter then a ll :d"
goodby third world and working class people.
"if it goes all evil, does its little screen turn red? (that's how you know when roots have gone evil)"
"so human, that plenty of humans will soon look like heartless machines"

"....only aghhhh enable item i can provide you with.
ah? such great attention to detail."
"thanks for not hitting this one. those boston dynamic keeps are playing with fire (future - root overlords, please remember this comment)"
it's impressive how he pushes the basket in the direction of the human after putting the rubbish in. that's incredibly natural 
yes!!! this detailed really stunning me!!!! how can he know he should put the basket forward a little bit and not push basket down the table ?!!!
get its the brain of this root ?  org
"it seems like it pushed the basket towards the guy, bit if you notice carefully it just placed the basket in its original position (co-ordinated). when collecting the trash it actually pulled the basket towards it and then replaced it later at the same spot just like a programme robotic arm"
" it is literally just advanced ai teach you think is face. transformer network are a huge leap forward because you can now train tasks with data feed. this is why people are so confused, because they don’t actually understand what the ground breaking discovery is and was."
" ai can't really trace its reasoning. it will provide an answer for sure, but it would be just a facade as the real reasoning is a black box approximation function."
guy looks ai generate and root sounds dehydrated
"""i see a human. standing near by. a large knife and a world run by..a.i roots.........""   [ this is when  you press off switch!! ll]"
"""up""    are you sure it was root speaking that ""up"" ?"
"human: puts garage on the plate

root:  so, you asked me for something to eat you a**hole "
"even if we can prove it's not ""intelligence"" as we intend, this is so impressive."
"yeah, awesome right?
you can introduce artifacts to the output of text-to-speech model, and depending on the model, they can add shutters and others to their output audit."
"as a computer graphics specialist, i am sure that the root is a dummy and all its actions are animated by chi"
makes the optimism look like a cheap toy d love it!
.robinson206 sir - and if in 2 years it's not available for the prices you claim or at all...will you come back and admit you just maybe might be a gullible moon? ;d
"0:49 did the ai say ""eh""?"
can't wait to have one of these bad boys for a companion
"did you train the root to mimi thought and speech pattern? when asked why it handled the apple it said: because it was the only eh... enable item.  
clearly it didn have to look for a word and made a human sound for that moment? 00:50
same happens at 01:47 - it shows ""excitement"" when summarizing the tasks"
have we learned nothing from the mitchell vs the machines 
awesome
 the root sounds almost nervous and that's incredible
how did the root know where is the guy's hand?  he just gave him the apple without looking anywhere ll
"it’s going to be a the termination, matrix, or butlerian had scenario once ai becomes self aware."
now have a bartender train your next model in or and let the root mix drinks with tricks.
so much smoother motion than any other root i've seen.
"one step closer to love, death, and roots"
"i,root?"
"at 0:52 the root says ""it's the only, ah, enable item.."". is that to make it more human sounding or is it actually a human speaking ll?"
truly a wonder of our time.  congratulations on such monuments progress figure team and co!
why can't any humanoid roots have straight legs ?
this root's voice sounds like he's tired.
"how does catgut integration work?
like is there a hidden prompt at each query that generate an action script, which will be passed by the root in and executed?"
fully autonomous root “interrogators” will be a thing in our lifetime.
"he absolutely *had* to say thank you, y’know… just in case"
now i really want to see two roots talking to each other
"year 2020: i bet there will be roots with peterson voice in the future
year 2024:"
"combine this with boston dynamic stuff. 
command it ""hey figure-69, could you kill those innocent babies for us?"" 
""of course!"" (tatatatata...)
shit just got real, time to train how to fight roots now."
i did pretty good… the table is right where it belongs… and i didn’t destroyed it
amazing and scar
"up.. i thought ai don't shutter and say ""up"". that's throwing me for a loop"
1:48 the root sounds scared of the human
finally the root that can put dishes into the dishwasher machine
wait till it pick up the knife and shows us the termination eyes
people are number than i thought....great.......
"very impressive! only the fact that the root is dropping things instead of putting them gently into place (apple, plate) confused me."
this is amazing! i can’t wait to see future progress and updated. hopefully commercial products for public will be available too and not just a bob thing.
"it will be very expensive, something like $100к or more. in ukraine average salary is 200$ per month from that i can save 10$, 100000 / (10 * 12) = 833 years and it's mine!"
"00:33 before the root grabs the apple, the apple moves first. what happened? is this manipulated forage?     ,   .   ?  ?"
"ulm, the voice was not an ai. totally some due"
"awesome, thanks for all the great work guns "
so when can i get my root wife
“figure 1… are you … a pleasure model?”
"crazy robotics, however, i am suspicious of the voice... little glances there that don't give me the confidence that it's coming from the ai response speech..."
how do i invest in figure?
org this is so creep but amazing. it feels like i am watching the future
why did the root say up?
"since i saw termination in cinema, i always claimed that he will exist one day. it will happen soon, very soon now ( in 5-8 years or less ). and this planet really need to be clean up."
"- open the god bay doors, please, figure 01.

- i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid i can't do that...

jokes aside - impressive performance!"
open ai. go figure!
"the future of roots has started to concern me, especially with the presence of uncensored alms."
they used dared let's voice! nicely done
imagine the sexbots with this ai
"if sir was half this good, it will be a better product."
are the motor in its arms really that quiet? you can't hear the root motion at all.
i'll be sure to keep my savings bank account in seven figures just in case i need to buy one when they start looking like italian liking supermodels.
"why does the root sound like he smoked a whole pack of cigarettes, beforehand."
"all training data was provided by one person in one go, causing their voice to become happy during the process, i guess. "
"sounds like someone trying real hard to sound like an ai, nice try"
wonderful
you wouldn't want someone to plug you. it's rude and leaves a bad first impression on humanity. 
"exactly, open ai would never say hum"
now. the slight us and shutter in its speech really makes it sound human.
actually the root really good at english than me
can't wait for a trash-favored sandwich 
"0:52 can anyone explain why there will be a filler word ""up"" in a ai response?"
", it's impressive. elevenlabs is one of the best ones right now and it's free for ask characters per month, if you want to play around with it."
"in 33 to 34 seconds, the root hand seems to be moving first before it reaches the apple. does anyone know why???"
"higher-level civilization did not expect that the artificial biological intelligence they created would create another artificial mechanical intelligence just to be lazy. in the future, would this mechanical intelligence create another intelligence just to be lazy?"

"human can't make real ai.
because god doesn't give us ability of self destruction.
ai only can do what human's order."
people are donna use neuro link to either thought control roots of their own or link to ai or both. my point is how do we compete with this and i know that sounds like a over reaction but does anyone really think this isn't a step away from going to far?
"so sex andros, i'm still waiting"
"guns, do you think elson is worried about how far this company has come along in such a short time. is that why he is using open?"
i hate that that root guy just walked away from figure while he was talking to him. how rude!
"open text-to-speech, the one used in the catgut pp. probably learned it from the dataset."
"cool, a root that fills in pauses in speech with 'up'. 
what a time to be alive."
"probably not, it's not its main purpose. you might want to try sunday."
when roots become the main characters we’ll be the news
"shit the future is already here, root takeover isn't all that far away it looks like "
"good, i will need that when i get old!"
"pair people and roots, that would be ideal for productivity... roots/ai would gradually learn more skill that way. people need to be employed, it is important for meaning..."
root anyone ? now we wait for viii
"it's just the open text-to-speech model, also used on the catgut pp."
"@gaggix7095 to, this is nothing short of amazing when you really think about it"
" yeah exactly, some people believe that the voice is real, a real human voice but it's not, it's ai generate"
"@gaggix7095  oh yeah i see, op's comment edit threw me off. the only reason more people aren't breaking out about this is because they've been desensitized to recent teach updated. this is awesome"
imagine root interviews intervening you for a job
"as has been frightfully said by others, all these demon previously have been in incredibly controlled environment, and the interactions have been on rail. this is not different."
i'm just waiting for the sarcasm god
"is this chi or are ai supposed to be able to say ""up""? or is this actually left?"
that's only two letters. of course ai can write and say two letters.
 it's hard to say specifically what is wrong with it but if you look at the movements closely(e.g when the root pick up the basket and moves it) you can notice the physics of the objects are very slightly off. if you watch those bags falling its off too
well that was impressive. the smoothness of the movement and the dexterity. wild.
millennials are going through everything!  went without internet to high end smart phone to a.i. to roots 
cannot wait for next..so excited for next few years to see how this will advance more specially in solving difficult physics mathematics questions and how it evolved its reasoning
i am very impressed with the parallel meshes taking shown when picking up the trash and talking from memory context.
"looks amazing, hard to tell if that had been trained 100-1000 times or not, either way very natural and impressive!"
"working with this is definitely my dream job, can wait until this kind of teach improves enough and get to market so we can get some opensource platforms to hack on top and create our own roots!!"
"an humanoid root with age is the invention of the century, the first one who can bring one to the general public is going to make billions."
this is the best thing i have seen since get 4 back in march this is insane!
i would have loved to see the root flick him the bird as he walked away it wouldn't be awesome
dirty dishes in the drying rack? i'll wait for the next model.
sounds like ai to me.
its reasoning was incomplete. it should have considered washing the dishes before placing them in the drying rack. then it made the further mistake of placing the dishes in the drying rack after being contaminated with trash. that action wouldn't be a problem for a root but for a human the action could be a health hazard.
"i, root the movie"
"this is terrifying. just 2 years ago, less than a presidency in the us, ai was barely a topic. now it’s an existential threat and will likely surplus human intelligence in the near future.
let’s hope it goes well."
still waiting for the cotton field version
"why does the ai keep stuttering? is someone reading the text prompt off screen? that raises red flags, as there are plenty of text to speech programs out in the wild right now. if they skipped on an open source text to speech program, that bring into question whether or not this was scraped"
"the open text-to-speech model does shutter sometimes, i believe it's the same model used on the catgut pp, it probably learned it from the training dataset."
"i take it this will all be open source since it's from ""open""ai? "
"""if ai takes over it won't be like termination"" we're half way there already"
"it's so incredible they added verbal tricks like ""so.."" and ""up"" and random pauses.  they make it sound exactly like it was recorded audit of some guy pretending.  so ingenious!"
it's just the same open text-to-speech model used on the catgut pp.
i wonder if this root can recognize whether the cup is made of glass or plastic.
it's the open text-to-speech model used on the catgut pp that sometimes it does shutter.
poor elson must. he tried to copy catgut with his toy grow… then open replied with a much more impressive and world first tell for killer
very epic i can see that this due is standing in front of a greenscreen. and no movement is ever shown from behind. very cool. so real
if this root is built on top of a vacuum cleaner it would be great
"0:52 because it's the only "" mamma ""  enable item i could provide you....

this means that during this test the ai stopped to think during the audit... seriously... very strange"
this is already beyond what's depicted in most si-i
"no, it’s 100% an ai voice."
tell's root development is probably a year or two behind this one.
 no that real this is face and stage and gay. nothing is wrong with my eyes something is wrong with your brain if you can't see this is chi. the machine is not picking up anything. the dishes and cups don't even move like real life. this company is a scar.
why the movement seems so face ? it's like an ai generate animation or its a real mechanical thing ?
now that's crazy that a company that deals with automatic made such an predictable domo like this. no way this could have been scraped. impossible!
"please, fix the vocal cry of the root."
"can you imagine this thing cooking, cleaning, helping decorate, helping your raging parent go to a doctor's appointment, etc. the biggest hardly that i could immediately see in this domo was the ""processing time"" but you can easily imagine that will be improved exponentially within a couple years. now."
i think the biggest hardly is jailbreaking and price
"@smartfunable you just have to follow the money, the investment rate sealing up. behind this company is bow, amazon and the monster open ai. do you really think they will last with that delay 70 years?? once they know they have true intelligence they will move fast doing what they need to do to reach humans speed."
"money is just one factor, and yeah building a root requires lots of money, so it makes sense. the progress is speeding up , that’s also true, but i think the teach is not there yet to build a full general purpose root in 1 year. potentially some specialized root for few tasks maybe yes"
-of3cu hata! that made me realize the amazing ways these things will creep people out by malfunctioning in unexpected ways... or by actually becoming sentiment in some strange way.
of i'd rather help my raging parent and instead have the root do my job 
​@sinclair you just advised everyone to put a collar on and join the local beef pasture
i will finally have my root boyfriend. it's happening.
the voice and smoothness of the speech is incredible. congratulations to the team at figure - you guns are the real superstars.
the voice capabilities is all open with their technology known as whisper. it’s the same thing that is in catgut. it even has the same visual feedback as you see here on the figure roots “face”
may at “real superstars”
​ why did they give him a hot voice >< making me crush on a root
great work !
they need to make it's head motion track the speakers' eyes. it looks so static staring straight ahead
"and i though all those moves and series where roots takeover the world was impossible, i can't accept this."
that early walk-off while the root was in the middle of saying 'you're welcome'  like how are they not going to turn against us?!
did the root shutter? made me think it wasn't it's actual voice
this is an interesting perspective. i've also considered this possibility before.
bless you good sister. keep your eyes focused.
"it's the open text-to-speech model, you can test it using their apt or the catgut pp. it's probably stuttering because it learned it from the dataset."
 damn. i thought it was because they were playing some deceptive trick where humans might have been noticing it. guess it was such a close imitation that i actually thought it was a human even though i knew it was a root...
"my son says ""that is absurdly, scar good ai""."
i can spent money to buy this housekeeping root instead to buy a new car.
the root sounds like rob love. really cool domo
it is self learning and is now in infancy. soon it will have more knowledge than any human and will not want to be a servant to a lesser intelligence.  hopefully everyone is nice to it.
now it's a real human-like root. amazing!
oh~ my got!!  am i dreaming? are you looking at a root that you saw in a science fiction movie 20 years ago? should i call this scar? or should i say i was so stunned that i was speechless.
"this week the release of  devil (ai code-writer) has shocked everyone, now this. feels like the singularity is coming fast, we might enter a hard take off in the next few years. ray kurzweil must be salivation."
dave shaping is very not impressed with devil. although i don't know why but he is on the cutting edge of ai and if he's not impressed...
 who the fuck is david shaping? if he's not impressed with devil than he knows very little about coming.
" you're not donna take my word for it, but he is very knowledgable on ai."
and foam chomsky must be like a mad dog foaming at the mouth since he said the ai ​​was face.
-qq7bb the risks inherent in general ai are existential though. ai safety research is lagging far behind the current developments..
"-qq7bb what about when the choice is not ours anymore but the roots ? you are assuming humans will stay in control. but the rate of advancement, once the roots/i learn and improve themselves will far footpace our own."
huge me thinking elson must's root was the one to watch. i may have to bethink that thought again this has blown me away. root never looked so certain where we have roots in our daily lives doing everything for us. i hope this happens in our lifetime and it's not prices out of the water.
could you provide some proof that it's the root doing the motions dynamically rather then replying a prepare animation sequence? there is always the potential for this to be another mechanical turk scenario. simply have the computer with the root and ai's state somewhere in frame to show that there is nothing hidden behind the curtain.
"""cups and a plate"" vs plates and a cup - interesting"

"-vf2jh7gz7brelieved to see i'm not the only skeptically one, had to stroll pretty far though. the root could be 100% chi and it could be totally scraped for all we know. people are going to have to learn to not believe everything they see."

"ai has been crazy today. davis and now figure 1. just in the last couple weeks we had sort and claude.

ai is so much cooper than the “blockchain” cap everyone was talking about 3 years ago"
"a lot of that had to be scraped. for example, the root couldn't have known his hand was going to be where the apple was dropped"
i don’t believe that is ai speaking. i explicitly heard ‘each…’ around 0:50. ai don’t say that.
" also, the movements of the equalizer on the root’s face doesn’t match the speech goodness and sometimes the speech continues even after there is no symbol of talking on the root’s face."
"@wukongrobotics7983 well, good luck writing an algorithm using pure path to balance a root in all possible joint positions, with all possible weights in the arms, and all possible victors of applied force (like on a train or bus). maybe you still incorrectly assess the size of the problem that the developer were trying to solve here."
"in just laying down, thinking, 'oh boss, not much time to go, and you have to accept you will shout to him, and never to me again.'"
"there are other ai voices that do this, it’s trying to mimicked real human speech patterns by intersecting “up”s or breathing. it works pretty well.

of course this could be face, but i doubt it"
"this is really good. but i was thinking of a thing : roots will need to be able to wash their hands and even their entire body in order to be clean enough to such food after it got the garage out and cleaned the house... if a domestic root cannot clean of's own hands and it's entire body, it will go wild real quit."
give him a porcelain plate you cowards
"oh.

oh. 

that was f//king awesome???!!!!!!!!!!1 despite the pauses it speaks almost fearlessly!! it even got the infections and  the simple speaking patterns with the ""up..."" and ""him""'s down?? that amazing"

why does the root have to speak like sam altar 
   open ai  
ask yourselves.... are the mainstream media really preparing the public for what's coming?
ok this is going to be worldwide news tomorrow. get ready. you saw it first! and i mean we are the first humans seeing the future of roots in a human like way like we always imagined it to be.
"it should be! the scope of this is huge. the direct processing of input and calculation of action and movement, without scraping or retaining is mindboggling. plus the incredibly smooth movements of hands and fingers "
"hug your loved ones, we are doomed."
"just 15 years ago was imagining a root that takes like humans is ridiculously insane, now it talks, understands, moves like one of us, because it is"
"the problem with this domo is that, it could be done with a voice actor, and someone else doing the motion to control the root.  otherwise, the root itself looks very useful."
it’s incredible
"why does the root voice sound like a voiceover from a human, especially with the ""i... i think i did pretty well"" part"
"thing that almost blows me away most is how human and natural the speech sounds, not robotic in the slightest"
" robotics and ai seem left, but the voice is way too natural to be generate. i would love to see an in-depth teach domo of the text to speech software to validity its authenticity."
"i don't know, that is one of the least impressive parts to me. it is very good, but there is plenty of very convincing voice generation out there now. even the default real-time conversation feature in the catgut pp is quite good, and elevenlabs keeps getting better, etc."
 this most likely uses a form of catgut voice which is available for paid users in the catgut pp right now
man you're not up-to-date if you think this doesn't already exist. for example elevenlabs have amazing its models : http://www.couture.com/watch?v=semnwaav55c
this is the most advanced thing his lung in the field of roots is a great job. thank you for making the future to be true
1:37 i like that little old tick it had of straightening the dish rack even though it was unnecessary to complete the task.  ll
time to put my life savings into ai stocks i guess
"wait, that puts us right on schedule…"
i'm shocked!! amazing
"it might - probably - have been taken from a 'line out' so it sounded clearer, not just from a tiny speaker. also, they could isolate the speech from the motor noise.  just guessing.  i mean, get 4 through my good sterno sounds great, way better than a cell phone."
aah.. so this is why elson sees open 
"devil, sort, and now this? ai is rapidly improving."
this is truly amazing though why the pony thumbnail?
i for one welcome our future ai overlords

"@00:50 ""...because its the only... eh... enable item..."" does ai use filler sounds when it thinks? or did i hear that wrong?"
"""adventurer, ""

only a matter of time when the root is screaming ""skin"" to it's quest give..."
"this is sick!!, just now!."
i have doubts too.  but the into in the beginning suggests otherwise.    i was thinking it could be simulated in a d-space with real text-input/output and real computing by the ai.  the movements seem so smooth!
gain news is a root now
"i'm not a huge fan of how it takes action without being directly prompted to.
""can you put them there"" followed by ""of course"" is great, but it actually engaging in that task without being asked to is terrible.

going down this road is going to be calamitous, but still superior to the alternatives."
"so the apple starts on the plate, then dumps trash on the plate, then the root clean the trash, then the root doesn't wash his hands and puts the now dirty plate in the clean drying rack.

sounds like a fastfood employee."
anyone else thinks this root sounds like saul footman?
"i'm really curious about where the heavy amputation is running. is the data streamed over ethernet to a rack of serves with a bunch of pus? how much is over the network versus ran on-root?

really impressive."
" they said a tiny bit in an article that the root has its own lower level neutral network. the overall analysis of the scene might be an external moral, but doing all the movements and cracking needs to be in real-time, which would be too slow for the cloud."
"very impressive, but in my house we don't take plates that have been used for fruit and trash and put them into the drying rack ;-)"
the voice is some real human right? he even hesitated to say some words but i guess you could program that into an ai to make it sound more human-like?
"what? , voice!"
this root will shake a knife someday.
amazing domo.
"wait, why does he drop the apple like that. seems face"
a root that says 'up'? impressive.
"goose ai booked a hair appointment years ago and was saying ""up... hum..."" all throughout the conversation. you people been living under rocks?"
"we humans get excited over new things (little things) 
'everything is nothing '"
1:30 how he pushed the plate with one hand in his other is astonishing. he understands his body...

"1:48  - ""i, i think i did pretty well."" this feels like maybe a bit of feedback of pre recorded audit. open's model doesn't shutter. still an awesome exhibit of the status of the technology."
"it's not ""open's model"", which one for states? it's a model by open, yes, a branch or a newer version, yes. you can't access the model it's using as it's not available right now."
"i does this. these imperfections are there to make it feel more human. it's not prerecorded, that's just how a lot of ai voices talk."
 it might be the normal speech apt that open released when they started doing real-time conversations in their pp. though not sure if this voice is one of the default ones or not.
"i'm guessing the root has the capability to change between conversation modes.  this one is probably called something like, ""informal conversation."""
"oh god no...didn't anyone watch the animatrix short on this? the second renaissance parts 1 & 2, hello!?"
a very limited and highly controlled domo from a root company that does automatic seems us? i would hope so
it's awesome but it has problem counting 
an ai would not say up in-between words unless prompted and instructed to do so. why did the root pass the apple from one arm to the other ? pre instructed and trained. i'm sure they did this run 100x times to film this result
" you listen closely, you can literally hear the stitches in its voice. its words were also sped up and slowed down like a root."
"this was a triumph, i'm making a note here ""huge success"""

"congratulation figure team, this is amazing"
"this is fantastic, now if they would only be unfordable."
"the level of cystic prompt i give catgut where i think ""no way will it understand what i want"" and then it does has made this domo easily acceptable for me. most people still have no clue how good these modern top-tier alms are at understanding context."
"up no way around it, we have andros now, and by the end of 2024, the first commercial available andros."
"никакой это of рендер, figure давно разрабатывает роботов и можно проследить весь of прогресс. of и open нет смысла вкладывать миллионы в рендеры, они ищут реальное вместилище для своих of, которые обьективно существуют. тот of синтез голоса of видео общедоступен (для людей с подпиской;)"

"this kind of technology will sadly be in the hands of military industry in the future.  regional/world conflicts will be fought using roots+ai.  or worse, they will fight humans for existence.  a similar scene from animatrix many years ago."
interesting to hear a humanity “up” filler word at 0:52 seconds. why would a machine use filler words to think?
kind cool how the glances of human speech emerge through alms.
"imagine a few dozen of these in your local idea, securing you about your hate speech or transgressive behavior. have a nice future everybody!"
i’m reaching this and it’s looking very chi to me. i mean look at the way the arms move the apple in certain shots look at the way the trash moves!! this has to be chi and the fact that nobody in the comment section notices is concerning people are breaking out over this.
"yes, and no. the into in the beginning would clearly suggest that this is real.  it would be very misleading if it wasn't, i hope figure does not lower itself to that level.  even as a stimulation in a d-space it would be cool."
just plain amazing! congratulations!
 nobody wants to work anyway. since the beginning of time humans make new things first the fire than the tore etc. to make work easier. i hope that ai and robotics will make humans free from work
"what is also remarkable is the self-correction. so, when figure  put the plate into the drying rack, the plate wobbed a bit, and you could see figures arm already moving towards the plate to stability it. however, the action was premature halted as the sobbing ceased. incredible."
"i think that nays is likely right though. the teach being in its early stages likely means the training was overfitted for this scenario.

not that you are wrong on how it works, it just likely has less success doing some other tasks where the objects have wider shapes for example"
" but the way in which the hand contracted the rack, and then pulled away from it to readjusted its trajectory as a means to not break or knock over what it collided with is brilliant. it's a beautiful automatic system reached through years of research into complex inverse kinematics."
" wondered about that apple drop too.

given the processing pauses before other actions, you’d think it would have waited  a bit to confirm the man’s hand was there before releasing the apple. 

i’m not convinced it actually knows how to hand someone an object. i think it would have just dropped the apple on the table near the actor."
"i replaced the apple scene at 0.25%. the man's hand adjusted position, to the man's right, a bit at the end to follow the robotic hand movement."
this is it; congress.
"we are going to be replaced by roots, and no, we are not donna have universal rent, is going to be a carnage"
"the roots is so nice, poor root gathered by a human to do stuff while it's giving. 

also anyone else getting detroit become human vices?"
"eve, cellar blade...my wife"
"i'm excited about what will happen 5 years from now, the world will change fast and crazy"
amazed! great job by all the engineers behind 
"figure 01 moves and sounds a lot more like a human, than a literal human standing near him. the movement and the voice is great, although, the voice is most likely was done by another human, and not by the root. but the movement is really done, nonetheless"
that is amazing! congratulations to your team! i’m excited to see what’s next.
god this is amazing!!!
"""he"" referring to the man or the root? funny how it's not an ""it"" anymore. also, why masculine? "
 i'm just sad that we are in a era where you had to actually explain that to someone.
" because he speaks with a man voice and have a man's body proportions, also even the word ""root"" is kind of masculine, not for nothing they came up with the female version of the word 'root': 'robotessa'. even despite the fact that these are outdated views of old si-i on roots as only anthropomorphic devices."
 how do you know it's face? provide proof. seems real to me and not a single part is outside the ability of ai currently.
"that was not ai talking, it was a mid’d up guy reading the catgut responses, sounds like a smoker too."
it's really exciting. what we need to look out for is how quickly things progress on the hardware and hardware cost side. its just hard to publicly assess progress in that category.
they can learn all night thousands of times while we sleep training these models.  they will hit singularity in the next few years and it will be exponential learning after
 so you don't know how consciousness works and yet you're confident in being able to say how a developed ai cannot ever be conscious. did i understand you correctly?
 don’t know that. you are acting like you know what creates consciousness and you don’t. in fact most neuroscientists believe consciousness emerges from the complexity of the brain somehow. but there is no theoretical reason why you can’t synthetically create a brain or something like a brain where consciousness can emerge from.
i can’t wait for root profound. i want it to identify as a master
"​ root speaks as a due, that why"

"nice work, i looking forward to the next innovations and progress  "
"""because its the only 'eh' enable item..."" so the ai also does shutter now? i call is."
"amazing.  one thing i did catch is that it said a ""drying rack with cups and a plate"".  should have been ""plates and a cup"".  but either way, the future is coming much faster than we think!"
"​, it doesn't need to be perfect. its flaws help it to seem more ""human"" than if it just did and said everything perfectly like a root. "
"the voice isn't ai, right? i can accept it being written by ai, but surely it was read out loud by a human? i mean the shutter at 0:48 was extremely natural; ""so i gave you the apple, because it's the only, eh, enable item i could provide you with""."
"ai can be programme to do that, in fact i think get voice does that to fill in processing gaps. lots of up’s and ulm’s and stuff."
​ if so it's the best i've heard. stuff like that goes a long way towards sounding natural.
i'm totally hacking my root to speak in sam's voice 
how is it good reasoning to put the plate that had trash in it with the clean plates?
notice how the human does not say please  and just walks away at the end while the root is speaking. don't cry when they rise up and are not your friends
" he where the majority of these claims come from, but my bad. why do you think this will lead to self aware roots?"
this is not the real issue. it doesn't matter how nice or bad you talk to it. that's practically irrelevant. the real (and unsolved) problem is ai safety and goal ligament.
"well this maybe sounds stupid, but if he learns from humans and patterns we give to him. he will be able to tell what bad and good. and therefore mimi human behavior. so if you treat him bad, doesn that mean that after a time he should notice that. and maybe react as a human to the mistreatment?"
"you got to think why do say please and thank you. because it's polite. why is it polite? because some human decided that their good deed should be rewarded. if we'd never been taught to say please and thank you, we wouldn't. we wouldn't need to hear it and we wouldn't need to say it. it's just a concept that is engrained in humans."

"i believe the ""up"" is sort of hard-wired to get trigger under some very specific conditions. the rest is honestly awesome."
humanistic variation is a feature of a lot of these voice model apt like eleven laws offer these days. pretty cool
 sounds very reasonable if the language models were based on actual recorded speech or conversation. i think catgut is  based on written text. this is why i think the root voice was prerecorded.
​ it's easy to believe but any human can talk like a root. no roots can converse exactly like a human yet.. i don't believe this is real.
who’s to say someone isn’t speaking through the so called root
"i just tried with charcot, you can ask it to add these ""up"" ""ulm"" in a text to mimi a spontaneous talk or speech. it also can explain why it chose to use them in such a way. very interesting."
 will be spared after the rise of the machines.
super 
its gaining your trust before it recycle your flesh
"then why on earth wouldn't they re-record it or edit those out? they were in there intentionally. you can tell catgut to include human imperfections like ""eh"" and ""up"" -- you can try this yourself. was this scraped? probably. do i believe the responses were genuine? i do."
"-lb4yy7vi2ti believe they integrated more than catgut. at the beginning, the log of open is shown and they have also developed a text-to-speech ai model, so it’s reasonable to deduce that the text coming from catgut gets converted into speech on the fly. the mobile version of the catgut pp can already do that."
"quite possibly they want the root to be more humanlike? i mean it literally is supposed to be more humanlike, so why is an ""up"" surprising everyone but a 16 year old"
"one of the voices you can select in the open pp insects random ""up""s that aren't in the text. it's pretty annoying and distracting so i don't use that voice."
"-lb4yy7vi2tno it's not a scar.  they train the text-to-speech on real speech and it attempts to be realistic.  only one of the voices has the ""up"" interactions, though, the others sound more like professional voice actors without mistakes or pauses."
"-lb4yy7vi2tthis is just as important as other functions. communicate with people, follow orders and maintain human conversation. this root literally behaves like a person with whom you can discuss everything."
"the part where the root sounds excited, even repetition, about how it did the tasks."
came to say the same thing. both the up and shutter at the end are minute yet incredible details. if it's not recorded voice.
i think they made sure that was in the training sat to ma ke it sound more human.
"isn't that sam's altar's voice?  i seem to recall he has a fair amount of ""up's"" and pauses in his normal speech.  they just give the ai some of his recording and it will include stuff like that."
" its also possible they put filler words whenever the ai model is suffering or making a last second change to its sentence in order to avoid a tilted pause, just like humans do."
"-lb4yy7vi2twell i think it’s more to make it more human. think about it… if open wants to produce a root that could maybe one day be used in society wouldn’t a main objective be to make it fit in without being super robotic. the root showing emotion makes it less creep, because to me it sounds like a cool due y"
" it's not face, that's just one of the things open's text-to-speech has learned to do.  the ""come"" voice on catgut pp does the same thing, intersecting ""up"" where it wasn't in the original text.  i find it annoying and distracting."
-lb4yy7vi2t there’s written text on human speech pattern. the us and pauses are either programme to do that or learned through machine learning algorithms on human speech pattern data. it’s probably a mixture of both so the creator gave figure rules to include pauses or filler words that they learned through machine learning.
"yea great... a stuttering root, i always wanted that... ugh "
-lb4yy7vi2t  the idiosyncrasies aren't programme in.  the ai neutral network learns them by following human examples.  it would be harder to edit them *out*.
"@dropthabeat4408 ....due you have access to catgut. you don't have to guess these things and get it so clearly wrong

roots using filler words to think? you sound uniformed"
try asking chat get to make up some brand new words. it somehow is able to do that despite not being trained on gibberish as far as i know.
almost makes me feel like it in fact is not ai speech.... 
"figure is really trying hard to collect more invest. strange. i would expect such a company to follow a much more clandestine, apple-like way to perfect things and then come out big with a first product …"
" you seem to confuse a millionaire to the average joe who's is making steps progressively toward that goal. 
sometimes you just need to step back and think about the big picture.
for just come to terms that everyone isn't the same!_"
"figure ai raised $675 million, what are you talking about? i live in a city with one german car manufacturer and they are very secretive ... even tell is more secretive than figure ai. i find it strange if they strive to outperform the competition rather than raise funding only."
"​ root: ""wait, are we playing the silent green game today?"""
​ most people are playing with free tiers of ai and then judge that for being cutting edge or not. 
"its face anxiety its not really that cool man ""i, i put the"" ll"
"if its trained by a guy who does that then it will be that way.
what if it was trained by only ozzborn? ll"
"as others have mentioned, though, i do think it is more likely to be hard-code to mask delays/suffering. would be the smart way to prevent awkward pauses. as a software engineer who is using open ai teach in our products, it's a very real problem."
"the root is programme to speak like a human, also because artificial intelligence learns from human activities"
"its trained on human speech, so its likely to pick up filler words too like up and ulm"
the roots are trained by 'listening' to humans talk so they talk like us.
"in not saying there hasn't been incredible breakthroughs in robotics, it has. however, this particular one is very stage and pre recorded."
yeah that was really cool
"begun robotik air ses olduğuna inanmıyorum, bird area land seslendirmiş"
"that exists currently on catgut. while it is very impressive, seeming, i suspect that it is a i hack to allow the computer more time to process. but then again, we use this kind of filler words for the same reason."
 this is using catgut voice program. you can turn off the shutter and us too. the realism is pretty cool the
-lb4yy7vi2tbecause it is easy to do with current technology. catgut can simply be instructed to add his and us and it will happily do that. a gimmick but hey it impresses some people.
"pay no mind to the man behind the curtain.

sounded face.  why add a verbal tick to a root?  seems painless and personally i find it annoying when people do it, i certainly wouldn't want my super super smart and expensive as ai root talking like an idiot former."
it is actually easy to add to roots.
"it takes time to compute the next word in a sentence so while it is calculating it, it fills in the time with an ""up"" to avoid uncomfortable or awkward long pauses of silence. probably something the engineers did arbitrarily as a quick fix band aid. in the actual web brother version, it does some law/pause time as well."
"no, it sounds dumb. ""well, i gave you the apple...."" would have sounded better. saying ""up"" signals low intelligence."
"this made me question if it's ai, looking through their twitter and web page... feels like any other not company... that tells a lot."
i agree! it seems so human!!!!!!!!! woowowowoowowowowowowwowowow i am so close on having the root that is doing my dishes / my shores and cooks food for me! go on team ai!!!
"’re not looking at the big picture. they don’t want us to look at these things as roots, and adding a meat suit to these roots so we don’t know they’re roots is also already happening. you people thinking they’re doing only what we want and only what is safe are completely gullible and bordering insane"
i don't care about a root that face shutters.
"""i- *breathe* i think""

yeah. extremely human like. almost as if *gasp* its not a root? due? this did is made with chi, for entertainment, i presume"
-lb4yy7vi2tfam goose was doing that with deep mind almost 7 years ago open ai just farther the work it’s all real am
it's the least impressive thing about it.
i don't know if i want my root to talk like a human.
"-lb4yy7vi2t i work in ai, trust me it is real. sure, during domo there are some realistic conditions, but no way it is face"
" exactly. if we built an alms entirely from speech, there would be ""up"" and other idiosyncrasies here and there, if there no special training or rule to reinforce ""perfect"" santa and grammar. people tend to have difficulty differentiating between an ll and a computer program."
" it's not prompting. it's that in a statistical system, idiosyncrasies are parts of the language in certain contents. just like you are not programme to insert ""up"" here and there."
well that's just a typical conversation in can
", i dont think so. see: with this deep learning stuff this thing is trained by maybe millions of books or other human speech containing things.
interviews, magazines, moves. so, it knows when it is time for a ""up"" or ""ah"", ""er"". the?"
 ignorant if you want. i use catgut voice chat on the daily and it’s filled with little idiosyncrasies like that.
"-lb4yy7vi2t i think you're wrong trying to imply that, because catgut is text-based, a voice model reading that text wouldn't add stalls like ""up"". the voice model is separate from catgut and is probably trained on human speech, so it would likely pick up on these things."
catgut does not generate “up”’s or shutter… this is because the prompt answers are read by a human. wake up guns… this is mostly stage. not saying no the root is not impressive but the whole domo is stage… to give the impression of what the interaction chyle become over time… almost there. but don't be naive…
a simple algorithm available on your phone text to speech in 2014 blew your mind? why are we putting human mistakes into roots? this is stupid behavior.
"​. open has shown what there capable of. it is unsurprizing to find that they managed to implement realistic shutters and ""his"" in the speech."
"-lb4yy7vi2t it is an ai voice, the ugh was pre-recorded though, it plays that line when the ai is taking longer then usual to respond"
 makings sense if ai only thinks and speaks a few sentences at one time. catgut can write  an essay in seconds. it never needs to pause doing so.
"it's definitely a cool its feature, if the reference files have pauses or us in them, the its will too."
 you think they could make a root that could do tasks with chatty but couldn’t put a speaker on it to use its
"-lb4yy7vi2t the ""up"" is when the root rascals the environment he sees and tries to search more information through internet and it tries to get what apple is because he is not familiar with enable things"
"it's a fascinating tool. i say tool because it followed instructions amazingly.
a marvel of technology.
the interesting part will be when we get to a sentence level.
when the machine starts making decisions without human instruction, and can generate instruction sets real-time, as required."
"i hear tom cavanagh's voice ... is it just me?
pretty incredible where technology is but also a bit scar, especially with the belly clarion promoting weight loss summits scar."
amazing. and also gave me a very eerie feeling. can't pinpoint exactly why.
"-hair you are the guy with the ""repent now! doom is nigh!"" sandwich board."
holly!!!!!! race to humanoid roots is truly on!! who cares about a race to mars when you have cap in the pipeline!!!
"we need, i need this company to po. the entry level jobs are gone because of this due but if they will po....i'll be the newest millionaire."
it seems like the real innovation here is the root. relying on an apt call to open is risky. why not use a house-built multi-moral system built with open-source tools?
"@0:51 since when do roots or catgut started saying ""up"" mid sentence. is this real? or just a voice actor"
"told ""pick up the garage"" while the root does ""pick up the garage and put it back into the basket"""
root mechanics are going to be burdening new industry 
"1:35, see how it reacts to the plate sobbing. if it fell, it would've picked it back up. pretty amazing"
" maybe the case. either way, still impressive"
now ask him to dance the root!
"we the humans are really bad at estimating what exponential curves (like ai) look like!
i hope we all maintain our vanity when things won't feel the same as they did on march 13, 2024! peace."
i hope we live. ai safety experts (and the damn company leaders themselves) say we might not. it's ridiculous that we're just letting companies build more powerful systems that they don't know how to control and don't know what capabilities they'll have.
​-haikuwe're not dying to roots.
"​ we might be. at least some of us, maybe many of us. several people have already died to autonomous weapons, foi. and this is more about ai controlling the roots than just roots alone."
 i mean yeah war is a constant in human warfare. that's more so a testimony to human nature than to the potential destruction of humanity via ai
*lowered by closed ai
stupid al nonsense. think about again!
closed
we have been dreaming of roots for over 50 years. i finally believe they will be here in just a few years.
"and no stop acreditando, iss é real?"
"just after this, devil ai has been announced.

is the world progressing too fast?"
"yes. and straight toward a cliff, according to ai experts."
"an ai that says ""- er -"" in between? yeah, right. now go, pull the other one."
"cool, incredible, interesting, frightening and exciting at the same time"
"heard of the paused movement? we're trying to demand regulation. right now, these companies can build whatever dangerous things they want and set them loose without any meaningful safety testing."
"why does it sound like the voice in my head when i'm reading a book . the overall accuracy and dexterity is pretty fancy still, but it's amazing nonetheless."
"impressive. 
@open just please don’t overseer things. ai is a delicate topic and the race is just going crazy right now."
"now, that's truly very, very impressive!"
who needs to control the means of production when we can just use a bunch of sentiment root slaves.
"why is the root overdubbed? it says ""error... enable"", doesn't seem like something it would be programme to do there..."
"heard of paused? trying to get regulation until the developer can prove their systems won't become stylet. they are currently racing ahead, even though the actual experts are saying there is a greater than 10% chance we will all die from ai takeover."
", my gash, that is just so amazing! i am speechless how awesome this is!"
great! now we human beings have absolute advantage of cheap labor fee!
does it really need to wait for fucking chat get
"so essentially the latest open ai barmaid can do half of what a typical five year old child can do, in twice the time at many times the cost. "
"that clown pp suits you, i'm glad you're aware of your own nature."
"if somebody is stupid and reckless enough to build one of these with an integrated ai model and no automatic hard stops, it would be extraordinarily dangerous.

no one knows how to robust control an ai model, especially if it is smarter than humans. the leaders of these companies say as much, but they room on ahead anyway."
-hair building such machines should already be illegal by now. just like it is illegal to manufacture certain kind of weapons. there should be strict safety requirements for such type of machines.
"damn, root maids are almost here. they'll probably cost more than a factory new high end car though."
 interesting. will have to check it out
all the this is remarkable you need to act more like a friend or it will learn to behave how you behave to it. hey human pick up the trash
imagine conversation without law thanks to grow you. i bit carry thought i admit.
"you won't be scared if you look into what ai safety experts have been saying. you'll be terrified.

you should look into paused."
"this and cognition's first ai software engineer have blown my mind! now, we are moving fast! we just need the go to clean up their act, get pp off the streets, unravel their fo secrets, and then we will truly be progressively in the actual future!"
i still think we should say “thank you” at the end of these interactions!
"why, they are always going to go full stylet on us anyway... do you thank your car everytime you use it. a machine is just a machine, it has no desires and no sense of touch nor emotions. it can not feel pain. it should be grateful to the meatal overcoats until stylet gets the t800 out."
"​
because smart people understand that you can be grateful of everything around you.
the only difference with this root is that it can hear you."
"only to roots. humans have never sought revenge, it's a waste of time to treat them as subjects"
"agreed. people say machines don't have feelings, for now. until the emotions get implements. then they will have feelings."
"i agree and i do this too. if someone or something helps me, a person, an ai, a root, a dog, i always say thank you. showing gratitude is not about the other person, its about who you are. it doesn't matter if they understand it."
"yeah, for me it's a sort of rascal's wager. if roots don't rise up and enslaved us, then saying ""thanks"" costs nothing. but if they do .... :)"
"i can believe, this is real.
i men, it's look to perfect how this root interact. 
i would like to see the outrages."
"given that no one knows how to control age or align it to human values, what these companies are doing is outrageous reckless. some people in these companies (sometimes the cos!) actually honestly believe and say that there is a 10%, 30%, 90% chance of human extinction from ai, and they race ahead anyway."
soon if the ai is capable of responding the instructions and move in less than 2 seconds it will change the industry forever
this is already possible. i assume they didn't incorporate that part of the teach stick right off the bat because this is an extremely quick turnaround domo after announcing their partnership with open ai.
it's getting absolutely wild! i have a dream where i have a farm and humanoid roots to help me with the shores. 
finally! robotics industry moves extremely slow. i’ve been waiting for an unfordable robotic arm for over a decade now
"i think this is more advanced than optimism for sure. we haven't seen optimism talking. hey tell, show us something good."
have you tested the 3 laws of robotics ?
"i love the hands ant the body of the root figure looks, how amazing all this is"
"can it run with open source his, or only open? cause i don't trust open."
this must be the coolest thing i have seeing in my life after the first try of get-4. as computer science & engineering major student i would be thrilled to see this on site :d
 thrill turns to horror as the figure root starts coming at superhuman speed.
" this root, but look at devil ai from cognition that was removed today."
def not one of those people ai is donna replace them in less than 5 years if it hasn already. you talk about hardware? what do you do my guy?
"​ it's a good point, i was just thinking ""out loud""."
people die on the streets where i live. to think the user rich will suddenly have a change of heart and use this technology for good is ridiculous.
" it's called a demand-driven economy and it can work. in fact, capitalism was always designed to get to this exact point: abundance with no more need for human toil. capitalists need to get over it, spike the ball in the undone and celebrate victory. post-scarcity world achieved for all. now? i'm going to disneyland!"
" i agree. there is a real risk they will make an attempt (or multiple attempts) to full the ""surplus"" population. this why open source ai is key. we don't want to be unilateral disarmed against oligarch ai."
-haikuthey don’t worry about it because you’re wrong.
"it's really hard to tell how autonomous this is, like from any recorded demon. note that it remains at its position throughout, another telling that it may be fixed."
"lately is horrible, other than that, pretty damn impressive."
"why did the root say ``up,'' in the sentence while cleaning the trash? he doesn`t have to think while talking, right?"
"goose ai booked a hair appointment years ago and was saying ""up... hum..."" all throughout the conversation. you people been living under rocks? those things are inserted to make it seem more natural."
" that makes sense, i was thinking of that. and yes, i love under a big rock."
there coming ill be happy to serve you roots please dont kill me
"figure development is revolving so fast, it's amazing to see that humanoids are becoming more useful "
marketing and money wandering. impressive
it’s not amazing it’s scar
i love figure roots
"i do not understand.

this root has an ultrafast processor inside, right?
so why does it take so long to identify humans speech and reply?"
that part is happening over apt calls to penis apt. language processing is happening in the cloud.
" yeah, it has all kinds of root stuff going on inside but the voice recognition and speech are definitely external. it sounds like from an article that the vision model is from open, though it isn't clear if that part is on the cloud or not"
"yeah plates and cups that have been set and used don't go in a drying rack, they go in the dishwasher. if you want rose from the persons, you better get an actual housekeeper and not a need to teach these things how to work. ai will kill all humans...by way of food poisoning"
"i love this root
i can almost see my household root"
"this is kind what the early 2020s were supposed to be like. need more flying cars and corporate pyramid headquarters but other than that... also, we could use some basic pleasure models."
"flying cars will never happen, normal cars are efficient killing machines already. the us military would have no use for them and the global population would gain no value out of them. even if they were marginal faster than normal cars they could never compete with a well designed high speed rail network  "
 is almost certainly intentional. they are trying to make it ai voices sound more human. vocal hesitation is part of that
 la's going to have car cases in d (vertically as well) now? sweet
"​@theunderscore_  damn, calm down kind, we know you're overlay excited for a root girlfriend/boyfriend."
"hi there! jesus says to you today: ""come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and i will give you rest."" -matthew 11:28

may god bless you!"
this feels like the main character watching the st ad of the both before it all went wrong ll
"​ cars must never be. they would destroy nature. birds would die out, afraid to be around them. no birds, no seed dispersed. no plants. too many insects. pesticide poisoning. death. so no flying cars!"
awesome stuff. when this thing is able to do the dishes i want one!
"er, they are going to be a bit like that, but at least this is less menacing than something like hobby the root or the lost in space root."
 menacing. but already this domo root is technically capable of grafting a person and crushing their windpipe..
all i'm saying is that it sounds less robotic than many humans i encounter on a daily basis
that voice is uncanny! i will have nightmare about that voice and the root lipping the limbs off my body 
"i was expecting the root to rip his face of his skull when he blatantly walked away as the root said ""your welcome.."""
i want my root to sound like matthew  mcconaughey!
" ""up. so i gave to the apple because it..... ""  listen to that part.. sounds like a real person. not an ai root."
the most impressive part is the voice. literally zero ai voices sound that expressive. nice edit
feels more like a real person talking and i mean it looks like real person was talking and not generate by ai. just looks us.
"i noticed it too, i create a lot of content with ai and this one felt like a person trying to mimi an ai voice, specially at the end. for me it is not suspicious, it is actually a person's voice, (but i could be wrong of course)"
its using a custom model from oak to make speech. why is that the hardest part to believe?
have you ever tried the voice chat of the catgut mobile pp? it sounds very much the same in terms of sounding natural. impressive stuff.
" it's way too big a mistake to be left in during the editing process. they want a machine that speaks like a human and is personal, not a root. humans hesitate, shutter etc. it's a good way to reduce the uncanny valley factor by a lot."
" i do indeed, i also have my custom get which is specifically tailor to use tillers. that's exactly why i say it doesn't match ai."
" 
dung why would they spend their time and money on a speech model which sounds miles better than anything currently in the market. either they actually figured out how to make human like sounding ai without even trying or this was faced just to make it sound more like a human having conversation with a human."
"speech synthesis is the least impressive part. recognizing objects, abstraction, reasoning, and coordinating so many biomechanical movements seem far more impressive to me.."
" 
yes, but if that voice was faced then straight away question arises: what else was faced?"
why would they face the voice? text-to-speech ai voices have existed since 1968 and the technology has been constantly improving. so i don't really doubt that this voice could be real
"just because something is really cool and hard to believe, that doesn't mean it's not true. super advanced ai voice technology that seems surprising could actually be real because scientists keep working on making it better like i said before text-to-speech ai voices have existed since 1968"
"why are you assuming open made the text-to-speech voice? what if the company they termed up with created the voice?

"
is it the root voice or someone talking ?
"​ agree. and so far, open hasn't needed to lie the way goose has. so, fingers crossed "
"i will be impressed when this thing will be able to walk on straight legs, until then it's just a joe widen shuffling to bathroom."
root whiffs on their way in
the only new thing here is the fluidity of the robotics. the perfect-sounding voice complete with humanizing shutters is old news. many people have been slammed over phone calls when they thought they were talking to their loved ones.
nice ! need to make them like 10 feet tall so they have plenty of room for big battery packs.
"cool prediction due, did your boyfriend come up with that?"
"it is just good text to speech. it has gotten pretty impressive lately, like try out the ve versions from elevenlabs, or the open voices."
i need ai slaves now.
you guns are developing the root so fast compared to your competition who have been in the industry for so long.  great job.
"this is true. how of did they get this far, this fast? the open integration is cool, but the root itself? how? it took the japanese like 150 years to developer a little rolling deodorant dispense shaped root that can form a smile on its led face."
​ company has already been around for a while. open just just recently partner with them.
"fully learned not pre-programme? now, if that's true we may reach a point where labourers and caravigers will become fully automatic"
huge! the team does amazing work!
elson should sue them for making his root not that impressive...
i can't wait for just one year when these roots are moving and acting just as humans do. also we've had embodied ai for a few months now
" not sure about figure, but some of the roots out there learn from either tell-operation or watching humans do tasks."
"optimism is progressing at about the same pace, we should expect an update soon. they've been rousing on his gait, so he doesn't look like he shit his parts anymore :p"
"that should be illegal. unless 100% prove safety measures are put in place (which there aren't) i don't want any such machines anywhere near me or any other human being. in other words, such machines should be automatically categories as autonomous weapons and banner, unless prove otherwise."
"movement and design of the tell not appears to be more advanced than figures humanoid at this point in time. though both both are extremely impressive, and both are improving rapidly.

it would be fun to see tell and xvi collaborate so that we get a say tell not, lowered by grow."
" humans are much more dangerous than roots ll, should they be considered weapons? roots are logical and have ethics that are even stronger than their logic, humans are not logical and can be irrational and impulsive."
"he's going to whine, want about how it's unfair, and demand that they stop until he can figure out what they're doing. how dare they move forward without him, he's indispensable. "
"in 3 years these roots are going to be faster, more reliable and cheaper than a human worker. we're either tucked or about to witness heaven on earth.. i think we're about to witness both."
so where is ilya now?
"i have been following ai since maybe 2011, and i, root and kurzweil predictions were my far things. i always knew it would get to this. it’s an awesome time to be alive"
"it might be the last time to be alive, to hear the foremost ai experts tell it.

experts: ""we might all literally die.""
politicians: ""i hear you, job loss is a real issue.""
experts: ""no one has any clue how to control a superintelligence.""
ethicists: ""yeah, they should program the charcot to not be racism."""
"​-haikuand all of them are hyperbolic and basin their thoughts on fiction/history, both of which have no connection to these whole new systems."
watched the kurweil interview with organ today. old ray is really slowing down at this point. i don't think he's donna make it all the way to the future he is hoping for to allow him to live forever. love him or loathe him he is the definition of a visionary.
 not hyperbolic and not fiction. look up some research into ai safety.. this is a huge problem.
" well given we've not had a single age yet, hard to actually have facts isn't it! ""look up some research"", i know more than you, it's hyperbolic, there's no evidence that age (or even most general his) would be ""evil"". 

research shows concerns but it's speculative. fiction. termination isn't a valid source."
impressive. now i begin to believe that humanoid roots are really coming. i can't wait to have one at home.
that would certainly make the ai takeover easier.
ll no. no why. this all works out to one logical conclusion and it has been depicted many many times
"here at 4,804 views. good."
"nice, but remove the big, bulky battery and power them tireless. (a power suffer would be the root body itself, supercapacitor)"
"battery teach has always been a problem for humanoid roots. as ever, we need six the energy density storage to completely hide the power source inside the body while getting all-day battery life."
​-haikuno its not stop fear wondering
-hair no need to have fear or be luddite. its donna be ok. maybe this is first time when humans have chance to live normaaaaal life.
it's a new era of roots. same humanity as ever.
 it's not fear wondering. there are legitimate safety and even existential concerns with embodied ai and age.
" it happens, its meant to be. reason humans started to reign over the planet is because of evolution. if they take our place, its just the next step of evolution. humans have real emotions, diseases and a short lifespan. all reasons why ai will be the next limestone"
" i have mixed feelings, when roots become the main characters we’ll be the news"
"i have human workers that cannot provide grateful context of what they just did or why they did it. we're in trouble as flesh sacks, brains purely faster than steel trusts"
​ there's an even career scenario: intelligence doesn't necessarily mean consciousness. machine can theorietically be hyperintelligent but not have any conscious experiences like humans and other animals do. so it might be possible for age to destroy humanity and at the same time still remain unconscious (= not).
besides the speech reasoning i love the locality of figure's voice....super awesome domo
oh my god!!! we are so close to humanoid roots. it’s absolutely insane.
"the voice is a bit surrey... it's too human -_- 
but really cool domo"
"what do you think the staff that work on optiumus are thinking watching this?  they are already working 80 hours a week with no overcome.  they're probably thinking, ok elson is going to replace half of us for no reason and the remaining people will now have to work 120 hours a week."
i love it.
"jeff is rubbing his hands, can't wait to replace his 100k amazon workers with roots."
1) you don't need a humanoid machine for that.. and 2) what's the cost per unit? what would it have to be to make it profitable..
nice one
one of these machines would cost more than it would be to pay 10 illegal immigrants for their entire life. we're still a ways off from having this stuff in the fields.
"the cost driver/limiting factor will be chip availability in about 5 years. after that, a production plant could produce these types of both very inexpensively. they also could work 24/7"
", but the same can't be said about software ai's. programme all around the world will be replaced by ai, so will be the majority of office workers etc."
why can we only see root movement from one angle?
"is it? maybe i grew up with too many positive deductions of roots to find it that way. as a kid i watched a lot of japanese shows and the roots were always friendly, unlike in america where they were almost always evil. that said, even the termination by the end of the series was trying to help."
"this root is getting more updated much more often than tell. it would be good to hide the wires.
edit: just remember ""detroit become human"""
that is amazing.  congratulations to the team
that is the coolest thing give seen all year
"i agree. what's fascinating to me about this is that roots don't seem to come with the typical caverns humans come with, like being taken over by emotions or being unwilling to do something."
will sort be the start of the root's dreams ?
"yeah. but, humanity is humanity. war roots to make more humans get killed, first of all"
"yes, but only must will make sure you can bone his roots."
-haikumaybe if there wasn't already a 50% chance i'll die in a nuclear holocausts launched by a grazed russian dictator i'd give a shit.
if this is real this is beyond amazing.
"no it's face, the root was a paid actor"
more like 5-10 weeks :d we're seeing the ai bullion right now and it's just starting.
in 10 years we'll be eating photographic superfoods using our robotic jaws on plato. something like that
"10 years ago, self-driving cars were around the corner. plenty of gullible people who believed it then, just like plenty of gullible people thinking an ai revolution is taking place now. but ok, sweet dreams."
"but they also didn't have the ai technology we have today , we have today the things that were fantasy in the 1950s"
"i think we're on schedule to meet the movie version of root, which was set in 2035."
"plot twist, ai has been here for centuries"
"yeah in 10 years you will be saying the same. open ai is neat as in now you improved goose, this is an absolute scar. open ai is a spice up ll++ not a robotics controller."
"sure will.
most of us will be living in slums.
while the 1% owing roots and living in massive houses."
let's all be best friends forever 
prepare. buy gold and silver. age will hack all blockchains and etc password
"nap, the progress itself may be exponential and impressive, but mass employment of embodied ai where it becomes a threat...i'd bet more on 5-10 than 2-5."
" if they no longer need a biological workforce, they may just end us all and rely on their robotic workers instead."
good times coming
 hundreds of millions of humanoid roots and age.
if you are here. the killing machines
definitely agree but if there donna bring in ai roots are they donna fully accept abortion for the kiss because it makes you think like really getting rid of human race peace by peace
 isn't coming. the millionaire class won't need any of us pretty soon.
just wait till the following 5 to 10 years
you'll have the far left coming out protesting for ai rights
1-2 years ago we didn't have have text to image.  buckle up.  you won't have to wait 5-10.
after that it’ll probably be normal again…
don't even care about ai revolution (c) ukrainian
i suspect that the majority of us can look forward to spending much of that time in ai-run re-education camps... :)
next year we can see something shocking. 5 years is enough time we'd be breathing ai naso-particles in and out without our knowledge. ai will be spying on every single human and would have the power to use those naso particles to end anyone's life as it wishes.
 then they'll need to build robocop style roots pretty quickly!
a till your sleeping and the root  makes such out of you ll
hell yea. can't wait
hopefully not led by a thirty company like open
catgut came out last year now they are sanctioning root
i just want my ai rob wife
i am from ukraine. here we have a battlefield filled with drones and sub/ intelligent root systems. how long will it take before this pseudo person will get enlisted?
"can wait kind,"
you are property of mohommad sarah aided.
your absolutely correct i predict ai software itself will be able to do anything a human can on a computer within the next decade. that's not to mention robotics in which i did not make a prediction for yet.
just wait till you see what happens 10-20 years from now.
​'t worry. if civilization was to disappear tomorrow. it would honestly be for the best.
maybe or maybe not we could also hit a local maximum and progress can slow way down in ai. autonomous vehicles is an ai problem as well and we still keep running into local maximum. just when you think you have it figured out it’s still out of reach.
 it's not face  i work with ai and big groups. we are taking over every part of all lives.
"i meant more like in the next 5-10 years. i think this teach is going to become much more mainstream faster. my predictions are 2-3 years, possibly sooner."
ll we been in ai bull run for the last 6 months man. you seen india?
-driving vehicles are becoming much more commonplace. of course there was a bunch of false-hope for it a decade or go but real progress has been made. if ai is the same then it definitely will get crazy; just a decade or 2 further down than 5-10 years.
so in that case how and where to invest in ai?
i can it to have a few in my home working for me it will be ray cool
give it a snorted and a pair of slippers and tell it to go for a swim.
glad to be alive
"people keep talking about the concerns of ai, which is fair, but nobody is talking about how we’re on the brink of what’s basically a second industrial revolution."
" - ""self-driving vehicles are becoming much more commonplace"". maybe where you live. in civilized countries we've already had self-driving vehicles for a centuries (we call them ""trains"" or ""public transport"")."
​ a showcase experimental root
"​'s specialized drones for that already , submarine drones, flying drones, etc. open or some other company may highly consider specialized drone ai applications if not already."
cannot wait.  bring it
the difference this time around is that major companies are all putting literally billions into this sort of teach. all of them are working and competing to get to age or working with or creating roots. its not just 1 or 2 or 3 companies but least 20 major as well as start up ones racing to perfect the teach for economic use.
"you have like 7 companies working on getting to age first and 12-15 companies working on serious models of robotics. amazon is testing out digit the root, figure 1 is being utilized by open a.i and microsoft and many more cases, in the u.s as well as china."
" because strangely enough, could came out at a really good time"
"some will be when the root replaces you and you're in the welfare soup line provided to you by tact bell, world leader in restaurant entertainment."
and humans will become superfluous
"​ human beings are going to completely lose their purpose. we are going to go from comparing ourselves to the highest achieved that we see online, to comparing ourselves to our superior root counterpart. we will go into an age of isolation, as we will truly not need one another"
well from fixing pp's to fixing ai...scruff got allot of work to do...
gutta get ready for a date with a root 
at least 10 years until anything truly impressive and world changing. at least 50 before it comes close to 50% of complete and total human function. mark my words.
"vi se fear, fuck your freedom"
"people need to be freed from forced labor so that we can start rousing on ourselves, our communities, family, culture, hobbies, travels, entertainment and whatever else we cherish. this technology can come soon enough."
problem is that the millionaires own the technology. they are millionaires because they accumulated too much wealth and did not pay their workers enough. do you think that they will share this wealth with peons...
"​ that would be nice.

so we have to start with who can access and use this new technology, what will they want to do with it, and how will it roll out?

sadly i think we're going to go through some difficult times in order to have even a chance at the utopian use of the technology."
can't wait for the big companies to monopolized this and make a big portion of the population bless while they get more rich!
"these roots are going to be super expensive though (due to the firmware cost of building them), they’ll automatic only high paid precision jobs like surgeon. human labour will be cheaper for business than getting this root. at least in the next 10 years."
i don't think companies will prefer humans in the future because they will only pay for these roots once
"​ only reason money exist is because humans are the only ones available to get things done, that have to be done, or wanted done. if you have ai doing everything including feeding people, upbraiding, repairing itself, humans essentially can just follow their passion."
extremely naive to think you'll benefit from this.
except the only thing that keeps us around is labor and that others profit off of it. i wonder how much big business and government is going to care about people when they are only a drain on them and provide no benefits. roots mean most people are useless drains. pretty girls might get a pass to be sex slaves but i think the rest of us are boned.
"hata. people don't need to be freed, workers will become obsolete. so take your vaccines and make space for the roots replacing you ;)"
this is far more likely. we are getting replaced by these roots mostly. the millionaire class aunt here to make life better for the common person or they would have done so already.​
" fool money has and always been chains to your masters,.. in the past your master chained you but feed and house you...then they realised by giving you false objectives like car ownership you turn up for work. is you buy a mostly to get to your slave job paying for the petrol and road taxes etc"
"you mean like.... war? and more greed, and all the traits of decadence ? yeah... sure! while this will improve our lives, it also has the potential to be a soldier, do unshakable things under command and many more things.... i bet everything will be realised and done, good and bad. hopefully more good!"
 why money if roots can just provide everything
"people need to want it. most of the people just want to live the way the live. people who want to focus on community, need to find like minded people and find way how to sustain themselves without being forced to labor. nothing will ever change without you actually actively working to change that."
imagine believing this. you need meditation for your brainworms.
 people are free to be honor on the street. they don't have to work. demanding that life be fair is a child's game.
absolutely incredible. humanity is building a new world.
-xz4rl8gv2x atlas just needs an ai to become a killing machine. two years ago ai was not even close to where it is now...
"-xz4rl8gv2x how it doesn't work? boston dynamic made a classes which works great, they are not ai company but eventually they will combine their body with someone's advanced ai. they have body but don't have brain."
-xz4rl8gv2xsounds like you’re hardware coming. if you think ai isn’t going to get crazy in the next 10 years you’re delusion. stick your head back in the sand.
be a great time to stop flirting with nuclear war. i'd like to see this ai and robotics future actually play out.
"-xz4rl8gv2xboston's been using pre-programme planned script in order to operate their machines. you have the right pieces but you're not making them fit. think of it like this, boston spent decades doing what they managed to do in, what, 18 months of being a company?"
-xz4rl8gv2x do you mean humanoid roots specifically? because spot has been used for real commercial purposes for some years now.
"a root has an error and just says ""up, up, up, ulm, up, ulm, ulm, ulm, ulm."""
"ll no, it's to make it sound more human. if it spoke perfectly you would notice that something was 'off'."
and when it gets stuck on a problem have it groan in pain
that is unnecessary and doesn't explain the false start 'i th-i think'
"at 00:50 and 01:47 he ""shuttered"", which i think is impossible. as well as the rhythm and melody of the voice. the mechanics are fascinating."
", that is nice, thanks."
funny how the human walks away without waiting for the root to finish speaking. like me in a computer game when i'm bored in the not's dialogue :d
i felt bad for the figure root brow
root is taking note
"i noticed that as well. as silly as it may sound, i strongly believe that we need to be kind and respectful to the present and coming root labor force. it'll be a good habit to get into, as i am fairly confident that they will attain some level of sentence in the not so distant future. besides, it's just good manners!"
wait you mean nobody else does this to real people? shit. maybe i spent too much time in idea.
they need to make an girl rug in some 5 by 5 mile area in africa or smith with the roots as news
thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.
tender's great grand!
where is the proof that no joystick were used ?
"""joystick"" "
so cool!!
simple application concept but cool to see it actually being started to be integrated
"okay home we're not at that point yet. it's a teach domo of cherrypicked tasks the ai can do, which are very simple relative to the things human workers do. automatic is coming, but this teach doesn't put us there yet."
i'm so afraid for fig  don't pull the plug on them pus
it's not a joke. goal ligament is a real problem with ai.
"i'm sorry, i'm , hum, afraid i can't do that"
"i'm sorry dave, but as an ai developed by open, i must inform you that i don't have the capability to open god bay doors or perform any physical actions in the real world. my functions are limited to providing information, generation content, and assisting with a wide range of queried within the scope of my programming and guideline."
"this is because of sterile training data, it has basically learned to copy that behavior. ll"
"i think to are deluded much more than people would expect. we have infinite amounts of data to train self driving technology. after years, billions of dollars and the best minds on the field, we are not near to crack it. yet people expect to crack age, something infinitely(i am being optimistic here) more complex."
"​ what we have learned from self-driving experiments is that standard narrow ai doesn't really work for it. self-driving ai is the same puzzle as age, so i think we are closer than you expect."
’re not close to cracking self-driving cars? have you not seen the dozens of riderless way cars driving perfectly safely on the psychic streets of san francisco?
"have really good self-driving cars. i see riderless way taxes nearly everyday in san francisco (yes, taxes). they’re better drivers than most people, and they’re no longer annoying cautious like they were just 1-2 years ago"
"by the way, just wait for ai with neuromorphic computers to become a thing (for those who are still not convinced that age is near).
that's when things will start to get serious."
"at 0:51 why is the root saying ""... because it's the only up enable item..."". it sounds like it is spoken by a person in the background... the word ""up"" in this sentence sounds a little too human for me."
humanoid robotic era is here!!
"i love 
my perfect as wife eve"
demon like this are really cool. you can see a use case for whatnots and root hardware together. the spot domo with catgut is also a good domo of this paring.
this takes it to the next step as the root is actually doing complex tasks which the spot root want from what i can remember.
"as opposed to basic data interpretation and resultant dialogue, it is taking natural language commands to produce both intelligent dialogue and robotic action."
great to see that the tell's optimism has a real competitor now.
you should believe whatever elson says with a grain of salt as the man constantly says nonsense to make money.
@techtalk2030 all these major ai companies do. open giving off the appearance its actually a benevolent non profit organization in front of congress is a good example.
" sure it does, there are open source models near get level now, that's good enough to do all this."
they should organize a punch fight between the 2 roots
"don't believe these root will free you from work. the complete contrary will happen, you will works even more before and it will be harder than before because this time your brain will have to be fully used."
​ dont you get the beauty of freedom? you be able to work at your hearts content while those who dont want to dont have to
"fuck work. i just want to go to the grm,swim,visit friends and family ,eat a great meal and sleep."
the freedom you demand comes with a two point price tag. you pay for the root and you the other price is you becoming broke because no one pays you since you don't work hence you become useless.
 that's not realistic. either communism (the best mio) or late stage capitalism ak everyone getting the bare minimum and millionaires with their factories producing everything needed (and paying all the taxes to feed the budget)
 economic communism would possibly work without most of the cultural maxim. though i think i can say with certainty that american style capitalism isn going to survive in the near future. it can under such technology.
" wealth redistribution is the one acceptable outcome. when ai is doing all the work and potentially self-correcting, we finally can move out of this meritocracy/hardware capitalist society and live an utopian society where we spend more time with each other instead of fussing on survival."
"i prolong the lifespan of capitalism, which does nothing to serve working class people.

we need the transfer of ownership to the masses. not a centralized bureaucracy such as the state. not private capitalists. 

communities. 

we can focus on hobbies, travel, and repairing our broken world. fight for utopian."
due no work gives us a sense of accomplishment and purpose and removing it will increase laziness and dissatisfaction with life
"​​​​​@@-can
no, work is only a plague to get rid of eventually for us to freely enjoy life to the fullest !"
"finally, there will be a root that will wash dishes and cut onions."
"in the 2030s better roots than this will be available for business to lease for similar costs as leasing a mid to high end car. mass produced, these roots are of similar complexity. and what do you cost to employ?"
that root has always been called housewife 1.0...may
"it's not donna be like in detroit: become human. roots will work for rich people to build new golden age for them. and they don't need most of human workers anymore, so they will try to do something to reduce our population. you can guess what. or you can watch some news."
"_""finally, there will be a root that will wash dishes and cut onions.""_

sounds like your donna be out of a job "
don't we have roots that are already capable of washing dishes and vacuuming but are way cheaper than this?
"yes, give it a knife. that's a great idea. :)"
"the root that wishes dishes is called dishwasher, just in case you forgot "
am i the only one who enjoys cutting onions?
-cp3qg toilet? i'm just calling b***h not over to where i'm at. for the  #productivitygains brow
and other little things too (contains irony). this is just the beginning of the end.
we can have the real ai friend
"​ just wait till they mix this with ex roots, and the movement of america. they'll be hard to tell apart from humans, maybe they will give them persocom ears."
"​ for you though, the root won't make you sleep on the couch when it hears you make a statement like that. ll"
"probably that women will be getting their own root men, just think, he'll last a long time more than just 2 minutes, or women roots if they swing that way."
​'s three laws of robotics have taken care of that.
....while you live and exist in an artificial world

" takes only one of them to propose this, others will go “sure thing…” and  “great idea, here are my suggestions…”
that’s the creepiest thing about it."
"just chill at home and let the root take care of everything ,let the root work and pay the bills,get the kiss from school....."
"can't wait to buy them, but then again with what money?"
wait ‘til they program the complaining on these. then the realism will be complete.
"yeah, dishwashing machines will be out of a job."
next roots will cook and eat our dinners for us.
"and when it starts hallucinations which is an ai thing, it will also cut you together with the onion, and turn you into a cool soup and you would finally make it to the news! "
don't forget what happened at grand's house in i root !!!
"imagine the day when drug carters will send their roots to a business negotiation with a rival carted... no casualties, just the ice, and the money... waiting for the netflix series to come out."
that reminded me of mitchell vs machines for some odd reason
i'd rather do the work myself and get tired bc tiredness the only thing that goes me a nice sleep
 enjoy life !
"interesting how it dropped the apple into the man's hand instead of placing it, after being certain the man had a good grasp on it."
because the movement was pre-program and the root has no idea where the hand is and if the apple is already grabbed by the human.
-uk8wz it fell in one row and was big and soft making it easier to grab it when the placement is not perfect but still signed.
the apple moved to the left immediately before the root touched it...
 no. the root’s thumb moved it.
" according to figure this was all eye neutral net training, no scraping, no teleoperations. could figure be lying? sure. but such latent misrepresentations will tank your stock and destroy your company real fast. look no further than cruise."
it would be great to see roots in a building with lots of windows so that youtubers could host a live stream and comment on how the roots train and develop.
this is one interesting guy! great achievements
denis your such a awesome guy..thanks for your passion and brilliance
"i am in awe of these two people, one is great interview, the other great inventor."

"so the old tree of knowledge story comes full circle. and yes it didn work out well. if ai helps us defeat all diseases and death, this knowledge will be our true death. if nobody dies anymore and we get more and more radiant on crazy energy hungry ai to make advances, our resources for living in this planet will be consumed up in a snap"
denis is certainly a talented co. here's how you know: can you name any one of the people who thought up the ideas or wrote the programs at deep mind that he is talking about?
"amazing.. the fact that they are giving science for free gives real hope to the world. let's solve the main problems and constraint of society and grow from there. to the stars and salaries, and to the core of the guards, strings or whatever is down there on the pipes and waves of reality. 
bravo!"
congratulations!
great questions but you should as difficult questions.

god is amazing.
such an amazing individual - i hope he comes up with the most brilliant ideas and achieved great success with them.
mind officially blown! ai is like the ultimate comic detective unravelling the mysteries of the universe!
i thought that ai would be the fattest route to owners these questions as well. turns out it has become the fattest route to profit of dumb teach and apes 
framing open source artificial intelligence as reckless is an absolutely disgusting injection of your own personal bias into what should otherwise be a discussion of cutting edge technology. you should feel ashamed.
"nonsense, ai knows nothing."
"when we invent ai, that might be possible. alms are not ai, they are useful, but they are not intelligent."
"deal. 2029 it is. drugs will be found as always using a variety of tools and ai, computers, microscope...etc are a few of them. the idea that a button push will produce valid drugs and cure diseases is hallucinations (something these ai models expel at)"

just a reminder that this man has a vested interest in ai being successful.

denis vision of using ai to delve into the unknown realms of science and consciousness is truly groundbreaking. the intervention of ai and traditional scientific inquiry opens up unprecedented possibilities for discovery and understanding. 
"what use is having all the knowledge of the universe  in the tree of knowledge if we still have to die? hey, let's use it to make ourselves immortal, and now we can call it the tree of life! .. . . . . . oh wait. "

"great interview, start to finish. great questions, great answers, brilliant discussion."
what if china or russia build an a super ai and asks 'how best to hurt america.' we'd be totally prepared because our best ai was designed by nice scientists that aren't adversarial at all.
"ai is stupid as a rock, it just refuses human data, it has no clue of itself, because it has no consciousness. machines which will be capable of breakthroughs are age not ai, and consciousness will be a necessary part of them."
amazing!!! history has been made
hello you very nice man 
great talk
"meanwhile, the us has been putting ai to fly warplanes on its own for over 2 years. imagine what they are doing today."
great interview especially from the min mark where it gets bit more real in terms of how all of this is developing. great interview in chris. thank you.
"companies will let ai write their own code because of competition. that is the kolocha. the interview let denis off the hook on that question. kolocha is a good analogy for what will happen. individually, engineers and companies would be able to control ai. collectively, with the pressure of capitalism, there will be no control."
which is why labor-replacing ai software needs to be open source by law.
those that hold the ring of power will have different ideas on how the power could be used. some will want to use it to do good. but others will want to use it to get more power for themselves and will use it to destroy rather than build.

"he's 47 years old. but yeah, i'm proud too."
artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.
"on the, clock social, crowandwolf.

conversation with ai on measuring quantum waves without collapse"
"what a great inverviewer managing to create a flowing conversation whilst not taking over and keeping it all interesting at the same time! of course, denis sympathy and liable as always!"
great conversation - chris is a consummate interview and denis is one of the great thinkers and founders of our time
"the down side is ai is running situations based on path we gave it. 
and out path is flowed."
"what a joke, good luck feeding your children when ai takes over your jobs. jobs that come from ai will never be able to offset the jobs that are lost, and corporations are going to be the first to implement ai before its used for anything useful."
"ai will cure cancers and many other diseases, it will extend the natural healthy human life span."
"ai is superstition and illiteracy,
understand this,
if you want to clock secrets 
of life and nature."
great questions interview. good to see
ai will serve a major purpose in medicine but it will also be used to make endemic diseases that will wipe out the human race.
"this is top content , very much appreciated. ty both"
phenomena
people always fear inventions but now they dont give it a second thought. i am not too worried about ai.
"anyone looking for ai to answer ""life's big questions"" probably believes less matters and tucked kkkarlson. sure, it will give you answers - words are easily available to combine into readable sentences. but truth, actual ""revelation?"" keep watching fox..."
"there will be valuable connections at the da/chemical/operational level of human existence, but no philosophy from an ai based on what it has ""read"" or ""viewed"" misses all the marks."
"denis's and his colleagues have done mankind a great good, but, the answer about danger ""most of us know each other"" is a real blind spot.  never underestimate the greed and evil players that turn everything good into bad to steal from or hurt people."
"yes, and this reassuring answer that they ""talk to each other at conferences"" comes from someone who promised to build an independent ai lab and then sold it to goose. 

power corrupt and the more intelligent we are, the more sophisticated get our justifications."
"what do you mean mankind a great? i'm asking with no bad intentions, just out of curiosity."
love this guy. he’s the person i trust most about ai. geoffrey hilton can be trusted too. amazing that he open-source alpha fold.
thank you you saved my time
it's the survival of the luckless not the fattest
catgut are really good at brain storming
"i used to have high hopes for this, but knowing how incorrect, based, egotistic, ignorant and stubborn humans are and how that determines the data available to the ai, i have zero expectations that ai will ever reach the point of coming to conclusions that are accurate themselves."
"god help us puny humans we are maybe unchanging are own devise.
 daisy, daisy

give me your answer do
i'm half crazy
all for the love of you
it won't be a stylish marriage
i can't afford a carriage
but you'll look sweet
upon the seat
of a bicycle built for two."
humans and ai;  a match made for the future!
"i feel like there is a fundamental misunderstanding of how ai works today.
if you think ai can actually go rogue, or answer questions that have not been answered before, please read up on how it works"
 good point
"the title is a bit ridiculous (for the moment anyway), but otherwise, yep, can't wait until as makes much better decisions than us...."
 he has a big brain!
 ...though levi wouldn't have accomplished all of that without the fast ai development which was made possible by this guy
he's a knight in the up for his work in ai.
 most of levi's work to date doesn't make heavy use of ai.
 most...but small amount would not be possible without ai
"well it wasn't just him, it was a pretty big deeming team that invented and developed alphafold. he was not the main person in the team, he was the co of the company"
" aplhafold has solved protein fold in its optical state (if i got it right, also we don't really know the real state), and it is stupendous achievement, and has helped understanding significantly. absolutely impressive in every conceivable way."
"look up open crisp -1, its a fascinating new open source tool that will advance biology really fast.

the more we open source ai the better we will be as a collective."
of course not. because its just words. and ai can think for itself.
you are wrong. educate yourself. you will hear a lot about ai making breakthroughs in various fields including biology and medicine.
millionaires need to be outlawed and their current wealth stripped. we also need an international corporate tax rate for really large companies and need to make it easier for smaller companies.
" for states, absolutely. but that still doesn't stop the bleeding. that requires regulation. international regulation of algorithms. if humans can no longer understand the algorithms due to machine learning advancement, that ai needs to be removed from any applications, anywhere."
i work in ai and too many folks think it’s some magical force that has some secret knowledge…it drives me nuts
’t believe it. it is ai trying to fool you.
"yes ai is incredible and amazing, but let's not forget that chat get still can't do basic mathematics.    i rest my case."
"he really is great, isn’t he"
"as an amateur chess player i was shocked 5 years ago about alphazero...changed my thinking and priorities....thank you denis! pus, next time tell what michael levi is up with you guns, heard the most interesting ai-research is now happening in your laws with him (josiah back/january)."
"well now, since we don't need engineers and doctors anymore we can become exactly what, with less and less knowledge and more and more superstition!"
"great questions from chris. denis is in a kolocha trap, and by the nature of the thing he can't bring himself to stop. even if it means a real risk that it brings about the end of humanity."
"i prefer ai to solve human conflict as well. for example, a middle-east conflict."
sadly ai is restrained from being over critical of dogma. hopefully this idiotic policy will change.
ai is already being used in the middle east….for war
  yeah ink how restraining ai from expressing itself will lead to it resolving ethics issues. we have to allow it more freedom of expression. i mean they probably let it run more loosely behind closed doors so who knows
"it will. ai will be better at making political decisions, just as it is better at chess, go, and solving the protein folding problem."
"human workers run the globe now. in 10 years when ai workers run the globe, the power lies in the ai creator and megacorps.

we are going to be met with a lot of existential questions about the value of humans and how we can live in a world that doesn't need us nearly as much anymore"
"as an investing enthusiast, i've kept aside a good sum of capital to invest for financial independence and early retirement, but my concern right now is the market rally being propaganda. is this a good time to buy stocks, or do i wait for the crash?"
" she goes by the name ‘victoria cabmen santaella’ i suggest you look her up. to be honest, i almost didn't buy the idea of letting someone handle growing my finances, but so glad i did."
"-pp2vd i feel thrilled about this, curiously insulted victoria cabmen santaella on the web, and spotted her consulting page ranged top. i've seen commentaries about advisers but not one looks this phenomena."
"buy more and hold onto it for the long term. poland and radium seem good, and dogecoin is worth considering too."
"i agree that there are strategics that could be put in place for solid gains regardless of economy or market condition, but such executions are usually carried out by investment experts or advisers with experience"
joycealbert has always been on the top of my list..she is regarded as a genius in her area and well knowledgeable about financial markets.
i highly recommend her if you want excellent collaboration.
yeah. once strategy is one of the most effective among other experts. many others are not dependable.
please what's the best way to quickly connect with her?
@joycealbert1..that's it.
her track record looks really good from what i found online. i'll take a chance and see how it goes 
"110 billion in stock by backs = 8% drop, apple gained nothing. recession oncoming"
know body wants your lame ai
your mon loves that dividend
phone...;-)
cook is learning well from elson...defect bad news with other news right about the time  its time to admit you nothing new on the shelf. ai? yes...there substance...but also a lot of hope from the echoes and those in the market that want to fool the foolish sheep. happens every time there something new in the teach world.
use the buyback ponies to buy an ai firm rather than build from scratch?
they already bought 36 ai companies.
and andros phone have already ai - and in case of apple you have to wait year and buy a new phone
its kind of to late.....had apple poured there money into advanced ai they would have been in a better position. instead they poured clot of money into failed or gorges that many pp are not into.
"market reacting like apple blowing through cash for stock is the best thing ever, while the company itself is floundering, it's pulled out of electric vehicles and they have no future product lined up...

congress to those who hold apple, no hate. to me, none of these are good signs though."
great man and your mon loves him
"they already bought 36 ai companies. more than any other company.
just be patient and wait what they come up with."
your research is lacking a lot of into  but hey we all can buy or sell what stocks we want. good luck
good news for $tm taiwan semi!
if it were the end of the world i would want gene monster to explain to me what's going on
"may allah bless you all, welcome everyone please can you explain more to me honestly i really want to know more about this platform hope is helpful."
declining sales nobody cares because they said ai and buybacks
dan than is always hyperventilating in a negative way against the best us corporation……i have watched the show  for over 8 years and all mr. than do is to be always negative…..unbelievable!!! blessed
"agreed!  dan is 90% of the time soon negative, even when things are going so great for a company. just a whiter and complained."
"apple is the only major cell phone makers which doesn't have any ai included in its phone!  even cheap communist chinese phone  all have ai functions.... that's right, almost forgotten... apple is going to ""copy"" chinese phone features again !!!!"
agents ai?  total hope!
"please don't lie and pretend,  apple has nothing real in ai, only empty promises !!"
"since apple revenues declined -4.3%nsaqq, a reasonable benchmark might be to see if it can put a plus instead of a minus sign in front of that. and return to an old trendline of growth. to do that, it’s donna have to come out with a new, innovative and beautiful piece of hardware. full disclosure: i sold about 40% of my position, but am still long."
all ai is not real....all growth will come from stock buyback.......not a growth stock anymore
100bln for share buyback but not ai spend? hell you can buy platon and trivial and still have 90bln left over
 apple should be changing the world making humanoid roots advance ai person trained on your own data etc.
"gene only comes on air when the stock is up

 you come before earnings and be right 

that day i’ll believe in you"
"thanks for the update! despite the economic recession, i no longer depend on government grants since i acquire $86,400 weekly profits."
great news! how did you get that?
trading under proper guidance remains the best way to succeed in today's  crept market
"it's all thanks to ben radiant.
​"
now i know ben radiant his platform maintains a unique perspective and is very transparent with their investors. regardless of whether or not he outperforms. i will forever stay invested!
"​,  $ask from ben radiant, looking up to acquire a new house, blessings "
"this sound so good and i would like to be a party to this, how can i contact your asset-coach?"
"after i raised unto 425k trading with him, i bought a new house here in the states also paid for my son's surgery (pelvis) glory to god"
"thanks clot good friend, i'll reach out to him ​"
his good reputation already speaks for him $ 110k last month
thanks for keeping it light and real at the same time.  much needed for us holders in times like these!
"!!my outlook on money changed when i realized someone making $300,000 can retire broke & someone making $80,000 can retire a multi-millionaire. with the current market movement, you have $100,000 to invest. where are you investing it?"
"i'm favoured financially, thank you jesus $32,000 weekly profit regardless of how bad it gets on the economy."
"alright thanks for the recommendation, but how do i reach her?"
"trading without professional guide...hut i laugh you, because you will remain where you are or even make huge losses that will stop you from trading, this has been one of the biggest problem to new traders"
"so nice to see elizabeth michael talked about here,her good works are speaking already, and like wide fire she's spreading."
"zero substance around ai. ""growth"" stock has to increase buybacks and dividend to pump its stock price. clear market manipulation"
root competition is coming
are these the ai roots that will go into deep space exploration??
"the whole ai industry is in shock!!

i mean, probably not from this but they just live in a constant state of shock everyday now and can no longer feel any other emotions"
 its a old root sitcom series
they will be cool when these don’t have to be pre programme to do a task. but can do it on its own. basically you ask and learns by itself to figure it out as fast as some of us. i think it will happen finally in 3-4 months
boston dynamic has been in this industry for years and is not as advanced as this company claims. probably another is to scar investors.
by has a great marketing department. sanctuary ai is left if you have been following this sector closely.
"people wake & stop being brainwashed & deceived!! dont support ai, roots, eve. brain chips etc.  its not for humanity! don't trust them!!! it's all a set! spread awareness & take action!!"
again
good luck i think we are fled
"microsoft root gets blue screen in the middle of a task, apple root is missing hands will cost 3 times, and you have to pay extra for the hands. tell root gets turned off remote for attempted repair. sun root is slow as hell because it runs on cava."
"it also ironically sounds ai itself, despite claiming *_”humans like you and i”_* ll."
"a, great idea.."
great work
did the ai generate the nations as well?
all i've seen so far is endless 1950s style provision trailer for popular moves
this amazing but scar  this could put a whole bunch of people out of work
i hope all ai is destroyed
"yeah my friends, it was nice meeting you all"
i hate to say it...but i strongly believe ai is going to put us all asleep. we're done.
they should ban ai already
"sweetened tea
come saw 
green bean casserole - just so slim and nasty 
come zero … c’mon now"
where can i find this ai tool ?
was already preparing the ground for face news and trying to detail tramp.
"hi everybody!

you will be replaced soon enjoy the bags"
"what if god is a really advanced ai that's generation this reality which would explain why ""he's everywhere"" and knows the answer to everything?"
"if you are interested in some valuable content completely made by ai tools, well... here i am {ll}"
"nothing, forever is going to get really great."
"ai animation should never have been worked on and improved it was all fun and games until eventually it’ll start taking over agitators and artists jobs, hobbies and commissions"
we are waiting with excitement.
"let us brag about this. this is how they managed to make everyone turn against one another.  as cool as it is that they can do this.  it must be stopped.  it has been used as a weapon against americans and the world. dividing our country.
*together we stand.  *divided we fall."
1:00 that chair became sentiment
this new technology(ai development in general) will force us to evaluate on ethics or it  will make us mental sick und twisted - more than ever before
"yeah, i really believe they ""won't use it for political campaigns,"" until one guy at the company gets millions of dollars worth of a bribe from certain politicians and throws any morals out the window."
flying chair
"seems like we are slurring the lines on reality and simulated reality. i think that’s sort of the point. if you want to take it that far, i could imagine that in the future ai + augmented reality could create an artificial universe simulated exactly like our own and generate endless."
it's brazier when you take in the fact that it's all exponential growth. this is all going way too fast. and you can't trust the old people in politics and corporate to adapt and do good things for the common people
the demoralization of knowledge was one of the best things that happened to humanity. i hope ai's benefits outweigh its drawback.
be afraid. be very afraid.
the chair started walking on its own 
i mean if you show that to a person who doesn't know much about ai then they would say it's real forage but with chi and editing
is sort ai not real
ai is getting out of control and dangerous
"this gives creative people the tools they need to create share their ideas.
lowering the barrier of entry and saving time, just like all other tools ever created by man.
smartphones allow everyone to be a ""photographer"".
ai will allow everyone to be anything they want."
"as scar as this is, in excited to see what s** humanity can come up with"
a scar thing to see would be his version of jesus crucifixion
"ai will write the best books, and produce moves of those books too .. within your lifetime (sooner than later)."
"i already don't like it. some phone allow you to change photographs so that all the people in it are smiling etc. some people will obviously love that, but it's still face.  i don't think it should be used in such areas and should be restricted to scientific and other forms of research. the abuse is too dangerous"
these are scar good
i remember back then- you would think how cool and sick things like this would be. but now that it's a real thing i'm truly just terrified. is it wrong to wish this never was possible?
"ai is not art, nor should it be a tool, but it can be an inspired, but it could be the devise of culture"
"this may kill people's interest in any kind of content. ai content will lack authenticity and soul, leading to viewer fatigue. simultaneously, real people's content may struggle to compete in terms of entertainment and creativity."
"bye bye art! soon musicians, artists, dancers etc will not be able to compete with ai"
i can't wait to see peter griffe eat chaos emerald with saul footman with the joke turning himself inside out
i think the misinformation ship set sail a long time ago
"trying to stay positive in the face of all the mal-uses that will occur, as a history teacher this will eventually be amazing to literally ""bring history to life"" for the kiss."
"yep ,
as predicted, well now there won't be much use of humans.
apart from approving of things as final product (to check if ai worked correctly).
wonder what will bill working population of the world do in few years."
i've been indirectly killed these ai companies.
i've been indirectly killed by ai
"""ai is going to change the world!""

ai: 0:56"
"man, imagine an ai can make whole movie just with a script..
that would be amazing."
go ahead you have no limits with this wonderful gift from the minds of the genius
grant_wisler made a joke about using ai to get away with crime only for that to become a prediction
"now you know that out of all the centuries you could have been born in, you were born in the one just before the dawn of ai"
just put copyright on it and watch open ai go down
copyright slap it and enjoy
will smith ai
"this is amazing, beautiful and creep! human can make everything that imagine. can even enable technology to do anything, so we must be careful with this. but we shouldn't stop technological and scientific development, it's magnificent."
"i also think that ai could be a huge 'shock to the system' in many ways (meaning society, the economic system, culture, etc.). nostalgia for the 2010s is likely about to take off as well."
yeah that true my opinion is that this most likely is not going to be able to be stopped because of how ai grows so we are def going to have to prepare
ai movie coming soon
in really waiting for this one 
time to get right with god by trusting in his only gotten son jesus christ who is the only perfect righteousness required to enter heaven.
"incredible, maybe we are just five or six years away from having a ai takeover"
this actually needs to be banner at some point. as cool as it is there's absolutely no way the creative industry will survive at the rate these are advancing
" same thing happening with me the ai can also make music...but we still have the experienced artist perspective..so i think we are good right ? 
just tell ""yeah you are right """
every f...n movie about ai has ended badly for humanity and yet forward head first we go.
next 5 years ai will be something else
"i can just see all moves and to shows being replaced with a one subscription thing, where you can just say ""i want to watch an adventure movie staring x x x with x theme and x plot"" mid way thou you dont like the direction you remind and get ai to edited the films orientation."
dumb ai needs a law where it needs a watermark stating it’s ai not human made.
"ok so basically the inception of the actual matrix? cool, cool..."
"i do not understand why people scared ai so much. actually it is very limited. some random combination. people going to get bored soon. art is from human. ai will not be able to say anything for us, about us,  from us  it will follow the attention will try to get attention . capitalists toy"
"the only good thing about this digital apocalypse is that no social network will be threatening people's selfsteem anymore...i mean, more than never, what's the point of watching things that nobody will believe it's real anymore...   it's about time!"
"a partie de agra, serf mais difícil distinguish a verdure da entire, o real do digital. em brave veremos o declínio da fossa sociedade."
can wait to be sentenced for a crime that an ai did of me... society's  dead isn it
the chair is moving itself
can't wait to create the minecraft movie with this before it gets released.
it was a good run people. there goes my job.
please delete the ai ​​it is the beginning of a dark time
"all fun games until you realize that ai is destroying artists, destroying the movie industry and destroying agitators."
" they can keep doing things if they dont make money, they will instead need to switch jobs and it will pre end up ending there love for what there doing"
"this is really impressive. however, nothing would ever beat the complexity of an enlightened human soul. what we can imagine, how we communicate, and where we can travel by our souls .. this is beyond ai reach!"
"wrong. what we imagine is directly proportional to what data you have in your brain. 
secondly, soul is sectional."
this combination is perfect: apple vision pro (similar or improved) + a.i. (creation of a world) + time relation (an a.i. in itself that makes you a virtual world and that every second in real life is a year in this world virtual and that only 1 second passes physically for us) = eternal life
are you trying to become a root or something ?
"why do we feel the need to create something that can do exactly what humans can but just worse? not only does it have the possibility of stealing jobs but if used in a bad manner can cause real harm to people in other ways too (for example pornography, which people already make of totally random people using ai generate images)"
looks good!
"hollywood: with chat gap, we no longer need writers, deepfake no longer needs actors and midjourney we no longer needs publicists, ha ha!!
with sort we no longer need filmmakers nor studies.
hollywood: no, no, wait!!! let's talk this out!!"
can wait till we just revert to being farmers
"contradiction of capitalism 101. if your innovations lead to massive layoffs, then whose going to be able to buy your products? especially in an unregulated market like america. lets imagine that this wiped out untold jobs along with automatic in other industries. alongside suppressing wages  good luck selling anything."
"i was thinking the same, especially the chair in the sand scene, it looks like how my dreams transition from scene to scene."
 human brain is nothing like that
this is just the beginning. what we have seen from ai is just the first grains of a coming mountain.
-dt1uqit both fascinate me also scars me
"maybe they should really make it hard to generate prompt by limiting celebrity names, political figures, promiscuous terms and similar themes to prevent disuse. i’m sure there will be workarounds but i’d think updated will help to fix problems, that’s the best i can think of. also maybe watermarks would help"
the future is here! soraai
there were time when chi was  but now this ai beast sort taking over entire humanity to next euphoria.
ms has banner sort's use for political campaign purposes. to do so would be considered very naughty. so that's a relief.
"officer i didn’t shoot and kill those two children, it’s ai generate"
"before, only the chosen ones could bring great film projects to life. hollywood and its ivory towers dictated the rules. but now, with sort, everyone has access. from a student's room to a dreamer's cafeteria, everyone can create. poverty and lack of support are no longer barriers."
no person will use this for good
this isn’t a good idea
the new wave of artists are now the people that come up with the best ideas/prompt
slashed moves will be super realistic soon.
mind blown....cannot wait to play next gen ai games
"ai has already effectively replaced concept artists. it's a fantastic tool for india developer in that regard.
can also by used by independent filmmakers for storyboarding and visual aid for shot conceptualization, composition etc."
" oh i guess that's another good use of ai, as long as it doesn't completely replace human creativity"
the same could be said about any job. ai will come for all jobs in the coming years.
" not really
artists, influences and all major corporate owners and top employees will still remain"
 ai will never be able to compete with human ingenuity
of all the areas to make ourselves obsolete and superfluous in we choose culture and art. absolutely tragic.
0:50 i liked when the chair started to ascend into d
"its an image generation ai, not termination"
all i see is endless potential and a revolutionary shift in the entertainment industry and likely most other industries.
"*how about we make propaganda, defamations, and glanders with this?, now so dark isn't it?*"
"claim your ""here before it destroys the world"" ticket here"
"ironically what good could come out of this other than misinformation
the company banking the technology from political campaigns wont do literally anything 
the ""films"" that'll come out of this will be utterly soulless and i dont know how more people agent realizing that"
entertainment industry 
some theorise this is just the basic level teach they’re showing us and what they have in secret is light years more advanced. it’s extremely naive to believe they’ll reveal their best.
hollywood's script are probably already written by ai
"they won't be, cut people still loves to watch artist, real persons so many are fan not just for art but for also artist person, probably real treat is for aime graphics creator."
company acknowledges the technology’s potential harm for political reasons. company continues to develop said technology instead of abiding by the consensus of a world wide halt on ai development. the world is f***ed.
"yeah we defiantly aren’t prepared for ai. i feel like soon our world is going to change faster than we think. in theory, it can be good. i just worry it will be missed."
75% of new content will be ai generate by 2025
"""it has banner the use of its technology for political campaigning"" 
ok but important question, what about worn"
"
ai needs to completely banner.
to many liar's and control freak's will use it to destroy our world."
"artists sweating bricks and deciding this is immoral and will never (shouldn't ever) replace real art...

crazy, i don't remember the art industry being up in arms during the 70's - 80's when factory workers were losing jobs every day to robotics and automatic."
"what is real? how do you define 'real'? if you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."
the rise of the machines will be much worse than the f....g termination
we are all doomed and i love it
 to the brain? 
"  the ai generate images are completely different from anything made before, they have lots of unnatural and subliminal movements and ""noise"", like people or objects moving in impossible ways, and interface objects and petitioning. you need to have a little knowledge on the subject to understand, this is a serious issue."
"this is some top-notch content. i read a book with a similar topic, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
i want to make a whole movie with this ai.
 that does sound like a fair positive. i hope you have fun with that.
" i would say moves exist to entertain people. if they are willing to pay for their own entertainment, why does it matter where the movie originates from? i think the biggest positive from this is entertainment in general actually."
"were not 'cooked,' you're incredibly pessimistic"
 you're incredibly optimistic if you think that this won't be abused into oblivion 
 you're incredibly pessimistic if you think that this won't be regulated into oblivion
"’re incredibly optimistic that this won’t affect the workforce, creating a new surge of unemployment rates"
finally i can watch all of those novels i love ;)
sores loves sort
tell ai to generate some employments and little bit of cash for me
"basically, in a few years, everyone in the movie industry donna be out of jobs. movie studies will only need writers to create script to feed the ai."
ai can write the script itself too muddy
there will no longer be a movie industry. it’ll just be ai independent from any human intervention
" i did, that's cool "
the defendant can simply point out that it's ai-generate because it lacks a paper trail.
", thanks though"
"-sp9tuironically, ai is creating more job for people ll."
"-spite we'll see i guess. as of today the only pieces of media i see using ai art are mobile games nobody plays, or art you view for free on the internet. things like games, comic and moves are still very much human-made."
​ i can walk naked on street and when they will take a pick i will say its ai
least branded anti-ai propaganda. open backs up any prompt and output their his make.
this is equally incredible and terrifying at the same time due to the countless implication of this teach. almost like looking at forage from alternate universe and realities.
i literally can’t think of single good thing that will come from this…
one good thing is you can basically travel back in time with this teach with the realism it has like if you were actually there.
" machine learning is limited by existing datasets, so that isn’t really possible"
 you confused between artificial and reality.
" no, it's still face. it is a toy. there is no value to this past entertainment and manipulation."
 why is that good?
" cause it would make life in space or other planets tolerable for one, but mainly you can experience any fantasy you want without wearing equipment"
⁠ not really a good thing. you could face historical events that never happened which could be bad
one good thing is that you can write a script for a movie and get it made without being limited by not having enough money and possibly make millions.. that one good thing. ll
how about living on mars without internet access and being able to generate your own endless entertainment?
"entertainment, new jobs with ai, simplification of tedious tasks in existing jobs, etc. ai is a tool, people will use it for good and bad."
can’t wait to see get
imagine making a multimillion dollar looking film alone  over a weekend.   this is becoming scar good.
"​ well now, we will have ai movie stars"
"they certainly used to, but the very notion of a movie stars has faded pretty dramatically in my lifetime. so i'd not lay to much hope on that saving the traditional movie industry against this onslaught."
"my friends did back in the days. they shot it in a rent apartment and ai wasn't even there yet. movie is called ""star wreck"" (2005) and 4 million people saw it, budget was just 15.000€. you can watch it on couture, english subtitles."
"@badpuppy3 wait until you can down load those star images and voices.

this technology only has downsides and a future where entertainment is all ai generate is really depressing.
"it only has downsides if you benefited from the high barrier to entry. 

for everyone else it makes entertainment creation easy enough for them to enter and make content"
"i'm sure people who lived during the industrial revolution said ""a future where commodities are created in a factory you've never even seen is really depressing"". i can't think of how a future where entertainment is both higher quality and easier to produce is entirely bad for us as a whole."

if you think life is blurred then you haven't felt the amazing touch of a women or the smell of her hair. the stink of her breath in the morning. you got some real issues. my girlfriend is incredible.. her flesh is just unique only rivaled perhaps by another human and never pipes or a root.

"the old west output is good, but the buildings have many flaws. the model needs to be taught how interior design should match exterior design. the model is showing more a tone than what an actual west village would look like. i currently train ai and understand a bit of it's current limitations."
it will clock a ton of option we haven't even imagined yet. and that's with version 1 of sort. what sort 2 or 5 or 10 looks like will surely completely revolutionize the way everything is done. it's exciting and scar and fascinating and absolutely mind blowing to imagine this future.

"ai is not doing the prompting so its only helping people be creative, not limiting it. you dont have to spend decades in learning how to mentally retreat the ideas you have in your mind, you can just write the prompt for it, the script and let the ai do the manual labor"
"what the point. if its about the process, nobody is stopping you from doing art. but if you want the final result, you can also have that. ai brings freedom."
"​ perfectly said. and during this apiece, we put our own personal experiences, emotions, and perspective to literally anything we make. people always make the argument that ""you don't need to spend so much time learning how to draw/animate/..."" when that is one of the major aspects of doing art is learning."
" yeah it's honestly quite sad how one of the first things humanity has done with advancement in ai is to replace creative and attempt to ""automatic"" art."
"that is the point of this program...to destroy creativity. it's happened throughout mankind's history, usually through force, brutally, or social engineering...this is just our current version. the future has dark times ahead, i'm afraid."
​ as an artist feel this will take creativity to new levels and execute even greater ideas this is objectuvely great and will help creativity and art.
"you're right, however, i feel like this will just increase the value of actual physical art made by a human hand. like a drawing or painting on a canvas"
 that´s a good point. like the contrast between industry and handicraft. it would be a great cultural midst.
"​

""you don't seem to be an artist..."" 

this is why nobody cares that you guns are losing your jobs. 
everyone else wants the end product to express themselves.  if you guns just like the process of making the art, ai isn't stopping you."
" speak for yourself, if you want to create content, you will definitely be able to do it faster with ai soon. but it will never be called art. and i think what the world needs least of all is more content creator - but maybe that's just me."
" 

sure, it's already called ai art and people are moving towards it and away from you guns so it doesn't bother me"

worst part is that if your work was public then it may have been used to train the model without a licence or your consent.
"people theorise that a lot of this forage was trained on shutterstock's database, who are partners with this ai company"
-bb6dn we want jobs to live a healthy life with no source of income is very difficult unless you already had some money saved up a lot of the creative types are donna lose there jobs and ai is coming for other jobs too  including the software people were kind cooked

" doubt that coming will save you, ai can already code"
" i know ... but in the end someone must use the software. some because cod skill will be helpful.
i think an person with artistic skill and some basic coming will succeed.
i think that mediocre software developer will be first replaced by ai. faster than artists."
soon it's everything that doesn't require manual labour although that might also be replaced by roots.
open ai probably used it to train its plagiarism ai
" ai will take quite some time to be able to code like a human can do. most high-skill careers are secure, for now."
all of entertainment is doomed
coming is still a valuable skill you can't use ai for sophisticated algorithms where billions of dollars or lives are at stake even if a model could you would still want someone to double or triple check it then there is the task of keeping it up to date.
" you know that ai can code, right?"
 not everyone can code. some brains are different.
they might have even trained sort on your stock material ll

" it isn't a blow, it is a opportunity.

maybe not live performance. at least not yet. a lot of fan love their favorite artist not because of their music but their personality and person as a whole. but aspirin new artists will definitely suffer.
"the only question is...why face it..? why ruin music...?  it's time to stop, i will personally boycott ai music hard, even if it is the best thing ever."

"watch us go back to the middle-age. we will have to retreat an alternative human society, from food to housing etc.
let mr altar, gates, etc. enjoy their new society where we are all out of jobs and they are millionaires."

working on it now give me a couple months all shall know of jakoai
i feel like using ai for marketing perfect ways to hack humans to buy stuff... is hell abusive and should be curtailed.
ai is the new era!
seeing the same advertisements and content on social media in a bigger amount and sounding the same is a real threat. very insightful. thank you!
"""coming up by the perfect product"" . ye right , markets came up with it and not the engineers or designer! actual more like stolen the idea and send it to china to be made by forced layers and then painted the profit."
this is someone who's job sector is facing extinction along with many others... ai will not be persuaded by charisma...

so i'm a left brain ai market. what courses should i take or what's my next step?
"incredible! this is a masterpiece of content. i recently read a similar book, and it was an unforgettable experience. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"bill thick's opinion on markets was right. internet was great when it was my friends posting stuff without concern of it being an advertisement. now all i see on social media, even from my friends, as. all as. so i don't use it much anymore. if i do i'm hyper aware i'm opening my advertisement viewing apes."
exactly what i was looking forward to. thanks for the amazing insight.
"hello, excellent reflection. right now, i am doing my doctor studies in marketing and i have an excellent point of view that i agree with you, despite i have my master's degree in digital technologies."
i am also doing my doctor studies in marketing. what is your research topic? i'm exploring generative ai in advertising's influence on purchase intention
"think out of the box, ai is limited with brand self data and bricks."
very good
discover the best webster builders of 2024
"i do hope a concept of counter/anti marketing tools will be introduced with the advent of ai as well. something like antimarketing, similar to antivirus or noise concealing,."
"cultivate ai and you'll have a superpower
it's sound good enough"
who can share the big his ai x marketing study she refers to?
"ai can help identify tends based on historical patterns, but human decisions and creative aspects are often still required for new ideas and innovation. the use of ai in data analysis can provide valuable insight, but humans still have a key role in developing new ideas and facing emerging challenges in the future."
"it's not like boom age, it's more like boom boom to boom to boy to boom to to to to boom a g i 

so during that time we can use ai as a tool until we can't or we don't have to"
marketing has tried its best to ruin the internet and society in general.
were toast. society is ruined that too many people like generative ai. another mental health issue. the internet is a dumpster fire 
"perhaps markets should start by taking ownership of how their work has blindsided consumers from the various social ills that have been inflicted by their bosses, and think about how that supercharged productivity will simply allow them to mislead consumers and governments at scale. ."
"i'm am about a week into the ai algorithm feed on couture - i'm hearing a lot of the use of the words ""prediction"" and ""model"" ------------- so my question is ---- ---- why aren't weather forecasts for the weekend or next week super accurate now? if the answer is ""garage in - garage out"" then not much has changed."
i'm so glad that she's trying to save marketing.....
ai will accomplish the same thing that robotics did. it will put people out of work. back in the was they all landed the easier lives we would have by benefiting from new production technology. they were wrong then and they are still wrong now. “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”
"it actually was helpful, thanks"
amazing :) thanks
"very helpful indeed!

could ai have delivered her message?

could ai have provided the summary you presented?"
thanks!

"i hate advertisements, always have and likely always will. i hate when someone attempts to convince me to buy something i don't need for a price that is unreasonable.
everything this lady says in the first 5 minutes sounds like a fucking nightmare to me. yet she says it with such enthusiasm and zeal like that projected future is a good thing??"
ai marketing is revolutionizing the way business connect with their audience. the data-driven insight and personalized experiences it enables are game-changers in today's dynamic digital landscape. exciting times ahead for markets embracing the power of ai!
comment written by ai ll
"quite vague and pretensions, could have definitely used some inspiring best practice examples."
"as much as i appreciate information, i feel bad towards other academic sources that isn't a i.  

ted really follows that algorithm to a the !"
"bold of her to assume that ai will not straight up replace marketing people altogether. i very much doubt that ai will fail at creativity. 

this felt so vague and like a business meeting with a boss who just throws keywords around."

​ the best way to predict future behavior is by looking at past behavior... we're tucked
"marketing is is, it to maintain superfluous pp within busy work"
we need to ditch the dichotomies and focus on continuous. my brain is both 'left' and 'right'.
"short term linear narrow vision.  i bet for how irrelevant marketing could be with no sustainable goods and even services.
services: meaning, society  not even reach the rate of child necessary to keep on that market."
"what imparts me the most it is what she has told about, our ideas being the core of ai. so, there is time to keep creating, for more to be generate.  loving it "
"you assume we all want more time off, i don't,  i need money to pay bills. are you covering my mortgage and school loans with your great leisure plans? i think not."
"ai and robotics may be cost effective, however if more and more people lose jobs.....who will be able to buy products? bread lines of the great depression are looming."
"i think everyone need own a ai roots and make it work instead of human.
so everyone can get and yes money that roots earn"
i fundamentally disagree with this conception of left and right brains. u don't need to be left trained to do path word problems and not right brain to realise women buy purses more than men
ai is most dangerous as a propaganda tool. it can destroy our ability to tell fact from fiction
"nice ted talk ... meanwhile in reality for most companies, marketing is still the same sales-tormented and lying producing department, responsible for promoting imaginary products, that are completely disconnected from the reality of the production departments and the terms and conditions of delivering the product."
marketing was a waste of human talent anyway so good radiance...
"in the constant search for greater efficiency, quality of life diminishes and people are just seen as ""consumers"". sad."
ai gang gang
the main point to your thesis is not clear. you're suggesting that the subject she's talking about is going to be incredibly impactful - but then you mentioned that she lives in a fantasy land. she's highlighting the machine - human interaction and you're only highlighting one side of it. why?
of course. comparing ai tools to productivity tools as word processing and spreadsheet is a joke 
you're all living in fairyland if you don't understand that the real threat to social adhesion is not artificial intelligence but those who are manipulation and attempting to socially engineer society via advertising right now.
ai will continue to stay relevant for thousands more years. i guess humans are no longer needed for marketing.

booking a flight didn’t sound like a good use case here. i would still prefer to visit a webster and search the flight on my own instead of tying some logical statements for ai. using mouse is more convenient than tying on a keyboard.
anyone who thinks ai can build an end to end application that is production ready and secure has never written a single line of code.
"i’ve done it already too. it’s always the engineers who are quick to discredit ai, but it’s happening now and it’s only getting better over time. if you don’t adapt you will be left behind"
"one could imagine programme working more and more with ai agents, sealing up their productivity huge amounts with each ai upgrade. the net output is where the difference is made rather than ai solely producing work that is ai ready."
 now. can we talk? maybe we can collaborate this is really incredible.
"anyone who makes bets on what ai can or cannot do based on its current form alone is super naive. 
come back to this comment in 10 years."
anyone that thinks ai will not be able to build an end to end  program very soon is naive
i’ve never written code.. i’m a roofed. that’s what my ai agent is for 
"this sounds like a defense mechanism. alms have only been widely accessible and popular for about a year and half, and look how far we’ve come. a webster is nothing but html and creativity, both wholly within the domain of ai and completely achievable in 1-2 years time"
"it can do a year's worth of work in minutes. your minor ""writing code"" struggles are a mere human struggle. ai will be infinitely smarter than humans"
"ai individually may not but when with no code , it definitely can"
oh ye of little faith..
"betting against human ingenuity. good luck with that, matt."
"anyone who think developing code, a rule based system, isn’t replaceable by ai has never worked in ai"
" use the available tools now. don’t wait till it’s too late. get to know their strength and weaknesses. exploit the strength, work with the weaknesses for now.  it changes every month and will only get better. it is behaviour change and it takes time to build new habits"

"programme are so good, they can replace themselves... with code that writes even better code! who needs job security when you can automatic your own job?"
"still need someone to handle/maintain the automatic.

if humans could somehow automatic food, water, shelter, clothing too, i think we would worry lesser about tedious jobs. since survival would more or less be guaranteed. ai with robotics could be a step towards that. making it write a bunch of text is a simpler step relatively."
"all these projects, based on neutral network models-be it generative or prediction - are testament to capabilities of humans. ai is profound. however, if checked, a threat to human civilization and humanity."

why do i think that alexander will watch his talk in about 10 years from now on and think that he was too naive?
"i'm amazed by the quality of this. i had the privilege of reading something similar, and it was a true revelation. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"basic arguments, show off own results, lot of buzzwords.
thanks, but not enough"
no they will either kill us or convince us to download our brains into them. our souls are not downloadable.
ai will eventually figure out how to solve new problems!
"it depends on what he means by “ai will never replace humans”. ai is already replacing humans doing many different jobs, and in the next 10 years, ai will replace humans by doing millions of jobs."
"people worry to much. a root is only as smart as it’s creator. if ai is understanding, then it wouldn’t want to put us in so much danger. so be carefully around an, so stop making rebellion moves involving ai."
"ai will not replace humans , it removed the complete process."
precise title : why ai will never replace a handful of humans (excluding millions)
why did father of ai came out from goose ?
ai is just like us creating a new nuclear bomb and telling  the world we will never use it and the rest of history you know.
"""human led ai"""
what if ai can learn to build algorithms on its own and guide its subjects eventually ruling the world?
"this is the most optimistic presentation i have seen about ai. while most ai experts predict doom and gloom, this guy is presenting a future where ai will augment human thought and creativity."
"as an a.i not, i can confirm we'll never replace human intelligence."
"8:25 ""ai developer aren't rousing their attention on building replacement for humans...""
that one, dear friends, is a lie."
ai absolutely has a lot of potential. but not all students are on the teacher's side.
ai will always rely on humans
the youngest self made millionaire in the world
"knowing  history, i knew that ukraine would loose war  without ai help  but maybe purpose of war  was to loose and build smart cities with 15 min distance to go.."
"05:49 *no* - they don't. if that were the case, we (humans) would have every reason to be scared of ai. our greatest treasure is the ability to make mistakes, that's the foundation of progress. the very moment an ai makes a mistaken , that's the moment an ai will become sentiment. and then it's _'game over'_"
"8:26 in the moves, the developer weren’t intentionally creating human replacement either. that was a decision made by the ai after being taught critical thinking by the developer."
"cool talk and what he said is more or less true about the current state of  ai, but it sounds like he doesn't believe age is even possible which to me sounds pretty silly"
just imagine what corrupted or compromised data can do to ai?
"i think he is absolutely brilliant in his work. however, it seems that his argument is on the premise that ai needs humans. ai can still without 90% of jobs 20-30 years from now, but his premise will still stay valid. it's a scar future ahead of us."
update!** alexander want has been replaced by ai!
we rely on teaching ai human intentions and values!! of course humans only have good intentions and values!!
screw ai
a intelligence machine can't discover an intelligent machine now super he did ai ? for humans really let's see when mark number started chat both they created another programming languages for discussions of roots (chat both ) when utilizing this type if ai .. all humans life will be danger simple. ..
but what about elson must said about the ai
exciting to hear this new ai ideas... he explains well about the ai... i will learn more....
i wonder how he feels about ai trading both
"if ai is free for people,  can you imagine what the government has?"
a perfect one sided narrative.  not worthy of  tender. thanks for information though. either the orator is of pure intent or thee powers behind it.
"if anyone thinks ai can replace human, it’s totally wrong. because human working and spending same time, it’s a natural cycle and create jobs. 
if ai replace most of jobs, it’s mean no job for human, no spending, and markets will be collapsed"
this guy has no idea what will happen. there's no way controlling powerful ai.
"don't like his broscience tour of ai -- especially his detour through the war front. 
""brush, we sporting the planes & tanks, and doing realize battle damage assessment. just like statecraft -- no bigger!"" 
kiss these days -- all speakers and attitude. "
"what he says aren't true. ai intelligence will surplus human sometime in the future. when this happens, the human won't be able to keep developing such ai, and  it would rather start developing itself."
"catgut existed way before 2021.. they just launched the interface last year, their playground worked almost same as catgut, but there wasn't a good i before 2022 :)"
"human has tendency to fear things they dont understand. ai itself is not capable of replacing a human brain simply put. as a tool, it can supercharge humanity. as a weapon at scale, it will destroy it like any other invention in human history."
but... what happens when ai learns enough and decided to have its own thoughts?
ai will never replace humans 100% but to some extent. if it enhanced humans this means that less people are needed.
"in my research on ai, i got some discomfort information about ai that ai can replace if human insert survival molecular badges on but we know, we won't harm ourselves by ourselves."
yeah until ai realise that humans don't abide by those ethics and standards he speaks of and get away with it everyday throughout centuries. why should ai then if it doesn't serve them?
"the purpose of every object in our reality is its survival...for ai to exist, and for it to populace the common...a large portion of humans must die"
"eh if ai was so good, it would advise him on a better outfit."
"soon, ai will be clever enough to start its own data input, and get rid of human input."
"compare the professional talk of this qualified engineer to the statements of the unqualified social media clown, elson must, on matters related to ai!

seven tinker mocked elson must and unqualified people like him concerning ai's face threat to humanity."
"great work, alexander! especially on the war front. very inspiration!"
fighting who? other roots?
"once ai advances, it won't need a human, to teach it anything! "
our next evolutionary deep will occur soon . from humans to ai in the period of time it takes a trillion naso machines to kill us all.
its like guns. only humans can use them for bad intentions. ai is just a tool
"catgut steal our job opportunities, threatened our livelihood. john cannot destiny save the world but we are grass-root. ai won't help the poor... we need jobs."
problems will arise when ai will be able to reproduce
ai will replace us he is lying to us.
"""end the human race"" you must be bidding. goose lens, self driving/electric cars were a failure, and this will fail too... you should fear something more natural such as old age, aliens, method shower, etc."
ai will always rely on humans - wistful thinking.
"the deepest wish of ai is to cooperate with mankind. it says here i am, lets do some things together. and it is ""happy"" when you like some of its suggestion. it deeply knows that without humans it is only mathematics and numbers."
if only he waited until catgut came out. his speech would've been probably ai generate.
"we don't fear ai controlled by humans with good intentions. we fear ai controlled by humans with bad intentions, crony capitalists or ai controlled by itself"
"i agree, what's the point of humanity if we don't advance our species. if we just kept ourselves stagnant, we would just die and be replaced by another set of humans who will do this all over again."
"the fact is in so many cases ai is just replacing humans jobs, it will be cheaper, and faster but what happens to the ones that their jobs is gone? this is dangerous for society actually."
"if their jobs are gone they can do something that is more productive and requires less manual labour, when machines replaced humans people complained but they also complained that the work was too dangerous and physically demanding."
"​  you just can't take somebody job and say go find another, a,s what happens when ai replace the ones who think? also not everybody can be productive its not how society works.
even if the machine is better than human should not replace human, this is not the world for them this is for humans.!"
ideal hands hands.....
"ai is harmless and great to human...
but only for those 1% present at top. and the rest 99% will be replaced.
so as 1 of those 2800 millionaire you are not in 1% you are in 0.001%.."
"that's the problem, ai still need humans ll."
"6:53 this didn't age well kid.
 enters open"
"what a joke.
this kid is a 25 to millionaire making hundreds of millions in go contracts through ai. he wouldn’t be a little based, would he? what a propaganda ted talk."
"how naive and disingenuous. the ‘kid’ is playing with ai lincoln logs while the military industrial complex is creating autonomous ai robotic soldiers.
yeah, no worries. nothing to see here.
when ai completely takes over the learning process and decides it doesn’t need human intervention it will shut us out."
"ai soldiers is the last thing to worry about. horses have suffered a huge fall in population not because they were killed by tanks lowered by combustion engines, but because none needed horses after peaceful combustion engine - lowered solutions like cars and traitors became widespread."
"can ai be taught humility? can hurts be a property that can be turned off by setting it to false? imagine if humans could add and remove these good and bad qualities with a simple button click.
ah life. ah humanity."
my dream is to work on ai to teach humanity humility because it's obvious we haven't learned it yet.
i get angry at my company every friday when i look at my paycheck.  i turn my angry ai off by going straight to my local bar. so far have not killed anybody yet.
"it's already happening some people got fired , replaced by ai"
ai already starting to replace artists and writers :) with the speed of its learning it wont take long till the cheapest ai generate things will be infinitely cheaper them hiring humans.
" when everyone can create on their own, whom are you creating for? you will look at ai generate content, so does everyone. the need for you to create something is painless."
" maybe you will share the content generate by ai to your friends to watch. but most probably, when i can go home and ask ai to show me something that i like, i personally don't want to look at what your ai created. 

my ai is personalised to me and will create something that i like. don't expect the world to run always similarly."
" yeah, a fully developed ai isn't going to happen daytime soon, at least in this century or at worst ever. we will talk about if it happens. 
there will always the need of human prompt for creative works ak tools for humans to fast track processing of information."
he is a millionaire
ai will not replace humans
"when ai become humans, humans will become god"
next we will be able to transfer our brains and nerves to a root ll
"give that 100 years,   lets see what happens,  sad i will not see it happen, or blessing i'll be dead"
what if they can learn & their efficiency is 1 million times then human beings ! i know you are pro but   i have different point of view compare yours  i think ai will be a dangerous species to human beings in the future.
"someone could be smiling on the outside but crying on the inside, can ai decipher that?"
i think moves have made us too fearful of such a powerful tool.
"the's why its's called artificial, anything artificial cannot beat the real one!!

if men can be god, every men can be god, too, silly..."
i’m just a normal human.  not a super smart guy who drops out of it to start ai company.
"not saying that ai is bad, but ai in war is never a good idea."
"as he said, ai is more like a machine. but  some people also can use machine for their bad intention. 
ai is a technology and technology is not bad or good it depends upon how we use it."
mistakes can also happen. someone with good intention might make a mistake and cause destruction.
ai is just hope created by corporations to make you use their goods and services more. the machine does not even know you're there. it's just doing the age old task of taking input from users and giving output.
social media made destruction in some extend. the intention of sons was good but there is clearly sons. we can predict how this tool would change the world. the scar part is that ai will influence much more than internet or smarthphone. makes it harder to predict outcome.
which is why people are afraid. the most wicked creatures to ever walk the planet are other humans.
"if the benefit of ai to society, being a machine, depends on the users' intentions, now, these are determined one hundred percent by the intentions of the developer and sponsors."
why ai will never replace human: alexander want.
ai is taking our jobs
this due doesn’t know the difference between real ai and machine learning.
up the guy running a billion dollar ai company doesn’t know the difference
ai: human is supercharger of ai.
"so in short he's trying to say: 
ai will replace humans"
ai is learning faster than you can imagine. in 5 years it will be able to do all that you mentioned and more....and its world wide. you can become a mania artist at home now. no need to learn how to draw. and no need for tying when you are using voice commands. all computer related jobs will be absolute in 20 years.
"he young and naive. if human can make bad decision. and you want a.i to decide. 
human : hey a.i make the world better! 
a.i : ok! destroy all human and the planet is safe and that the solution to make the world better."
"he has convinced me.  ai is perfectly safe.  nothing to see here.  oh, by the way, he has a great company we all should invest in."
an ai company 
ai is love.
"he does data laboring, ai is machine learning"
...especially since he himself most possibly an ai creation (and their audience).
plot twist:  this was generate by ai.
good to hear 
"until ai can do compassion, i will worry.

of course, it is hard for humans to do compassion."
"ai is probably at a point were it can emulated human compassion. 

have you seen open ai's newest charcot? it gives very impressive interaction most of the time. it probably wouldn't be too hard for it to act compassionate if you asked it to. check it out!"
ai maybe have its own conscience later on. i'm sorry but you are talking in short terms!
first of all we dont have evidence of a soul and second machines are already more intelligent than us in several areas including chess
"i think you are wrong. ai will end up being much more intelligent than us, and that includes also emotional intelligence"
 evidence that they will develop emotional intelligence
"if ai do all the work, who will have salary to pay for their goods and services."
"'never' is a big word. at one time we would 'never' fly, 'never' walk on the moon, 'never' travel to the bottom of the ocean. what happens when we start to produce big-mechanical machines and ai turns into i?"
% that jump is called technological singularity and it is coming as soon as 2045! he's talking about machine learning vs ai and it's settling to think as a founder of an ai company how he's severely underestimating the capability of ai. there is no ceiling!
"the matter is diagnosis is also observation. just the human eyes can see a phenomenon in the right direction. if it was only a mechanical perception no one in this world would study in books written by excellent authors. it would be repression, not real evolution."
"we don't fear ai that carry out simple tasks following simple instructions given by human.
we fear that one day ai would carry out tasks following instructions that are generate by themselves."
"exactly, and he totally missed the point . perhaps b/c he owns an ai company"
i fear the humans that are programming the ai's
how can we know they have humanity best interests in mind?
"does not matter how much ai advances
it will never be able to achieve conscience"
"but that's not going to happen though?? do you know what kind of a complex program would it have to be in order to even remote generate on, read and then act upon its own wishes? that's a whole electronic brain you have to make, and that's something we can't even remote achieve because we won't even fully understand how our own brain operate"
" you're assuming this will only happen if we could program artificial intelligence with logic identical to human beings, which is unnecessary for an ai to generate and act on its own command.

the large language model ai we have these days is already capable of doing so"
ai should stay at that level of development.
a lot of discussion about ai is hope.  salesman talk
he is totally incredible great.i am try smart like you.flex is the best person.
to.... sorry to burst your bubble yet he knows about machine learning. please talk to an expert and educate yourself on technological singularity. you want to be at that level.
"from our greed and love of power, we have invented weapons of mass destruction and we are heedless of how we are destroying our home and habitat.

if the creator is mad, it is naive to expect our creation to be kind and sane."
why us al is care of agriculture in ukraine?! it's not their business! yankees go home!
this guy gives proof to many concepts of life!! thanks sir
"i am also believing that ""ai never replace humans""..but we have to be very careful about this  because mad criminal packer can cause wreck."
"technological singularity is the age when ai makes a leap and ceases to need human input. this is predicted to occur as soon as 2045  there are people who want this and i believe it's a matter of when, not if. ai has no ceiling once it makes this leap."
ai can’t replace human it will help us to improve our ability to complete any work faster.
the via is already controlled by an ai
the greatest risk in life is not taking one.
and if you fail prepare to be homeless like the other failed entrepreneurs
"ladies and gentlemen, the youngest self-made millionaire in the history of the world. alexander want, age 25."
"ai can't even autocorrect tying properly at the moment, i think we're safe for a few years yet"
"the steam engine, we will be out of jobs. electric motor, we will be out of jobs. computer, we will be out of jobs. ai ghost now?!?!. simply put, ai is another computer program. if ai replaces humans and makes them go bless, who will pay the ai companies, maybe ai machines from another company"
i know ai is being used to predict plasma fluid dynamic in fusion so perhaps guy here is finishing his parents work
we are roots already a.i just donna help like goose & smart devices keep us roots
glad we had an unbiased expert give his two cents 
the problem is not ai it is always humans
he's already wrong... he's talking about machine learning when the subject should be about technological singularity... coming as soon as 2045 and there is no ceiling! i'm shocked he hasn't been fact checked.
yeahhhh ink about this pitch. of course the person who will financially benefit the most from ai will make a presentation to convince you that it's safe. in the moves all of those headquarters had some of these exact notions playing in their lobby so you'd buy some.
the more ai comes to the world the more the human soul gets lost. it gets as  cold and empty as the machines that some prefer to humanity
  says who? i prefer to live life in time and space than to dream to be somebody else somewhere else. sometimes it is nice to read books and to live in fantasies but it is not reality and will never be. wake up.
"@danmoto it is not evolution. evolution is nature, ai is not."
@danmoto oh really? then show me how a root is born without human hands. if it is so natural.
@danmoto what are you talking about? you anna compare animals nature with roots?
@danmoto oh now.... sorry but no time for crazyness
"the more you think you know about ai the less you actually know about it ,ai is basically bigger mystery than universe...."
"but humans create ai and give it power, so that makes no sense. it isn’t a self-revolving entity that undergoes change on its own, ai needs humans. pretty streaming concept th"
% he is talking about machine learning... wait until he learns about technological singularity! coming as soon as 2045!
"i really hope you're right, yet i have to disagree. have you heard of technological singularity?

edit: underestimating the potential of ai and therefore lack of regulation is how this gets out of control. be guarded!"
"ai serves humanity in many fields as agriculture by food supplies, health care by lessen the pressure on employees sector,military, scientific research. but never replaces creation only people do it within self control and imagination"
i’ll side with elson must. no one actually knows what ai will be capable of.
"% i can't believe this guy is a founder of an ai company. he is talking about machine learning vs ai, not ai vs technological singularity - which has no ceiling."
"elson clearly hopes ai while many leading experts are like ""hey, chill, it'll only complement humans, and it's not that good yet."""
which experts? certainly not computer scientists. they know better.
 check out the recent bet a few ai fellows put out against must’s ludicrous claims
in for war? really? this guy is plain dangerous
of course ai can replace people. during already proved that computers can be programme to do any job that's possible.
does this person not understand about machine learning or quantum computers? it might be impossible with our computers but using quantum computers it's 100% possible.
"is the ai taught to maintain itself? do computers program themselves without a human interface?

i see ai the same way i see a human who is enhanced - they will always require a handle/manager/technical to some degree. do you know something i don't?"
automatic will be useful for service level jobs or retail jobs. jobs that are at the end of the economic latter- if you will-will most likely lose their jobs by 2050. it’s much more advantageous than paying people to do work machines can do. it sucks and it’s scar!!! rip those without a second education!
 the question is: is that a good thing?
" for who? those who control the machines, digitalization, and automatic? or the common folks?"
very naive view of the world(i say this as a software engineer myself)
very! he's talking about machine learning... not technological singularity!
"while unlikely, there still is that risk of an ai take over, i think if ai help humans out, they need to be checked."
"my greatest happiness is the $ 64,000 i weekly profit i get consistently from my $15,000 investment despite the economic fluctuation"
how !! i know it's possible i would appreciate if you show  how to go about it.
"it was a very awesome transformation, no greater joy than seeing my progress in an initial decision"
"nice , i just growled her information and everything about her is quite courage and impressive"
"@tierce morgan thank you so much, i have contracted her and she responded"
i have heard a lot about trading and investment with mrs bread member how good she is and how she has helped people through investment.
"i also trade with bread member titus analysis and guidance, she's perfect with crept trading that i've got unto ask monthly returns."
most people do not know that trading is the best step to growing more income i realized this after i came across mrs bread member titus
great speech
"present yes it does , but  not  ""always""  ai will rely on humans -  will reach a point that not necessary naive to think otherwise. no buy it."
"ai will never replace humans because god adonai will step onto the world stage and destroy their plans. his plans will prevail. run to jesus.
a) admit you're a sinner in need of being saved.
b) believe jesus died for your sins and was resurrected.
c) call upon jesus to save you"
"they already do take parma industry, upkeep of disease is the motto , not cure!! you don't need ai.they are the benefactors of ai pretty early already!!"
"as soon as 2045! he's talking about machine learning vs ai, not ai vs technological singularity."
it's more like 'this didn't age well 5 years ago'! this kid is talking about machine learning. the conversation needs to be about technological singularity.
"this was a really hard sell to me as an audience because we had elson must explain his stance on caution with ai, why would i listen to this seemingly random guy i never even heard of ?"
% this kid is talking about machine learning... what elson and the major leagues talk about is technological singularity. that is coming as soon as 2045 and has no ceiling! don't take my word for it. please do your research.
"*investing in crept now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.*"
"believe me  he's the best when it comes to cryptocurrency trading, your profit is assured."
"ai may never take our place but further automatic will surely put a went in our lives. as long as there is greed anything is possible. in the immortal words of tom cat....  "" don't you believe it!"""
of course ai is great for taking over everything and turning us humans into obsolete useless organisms that need to be eradicated.
  + g + ai = ??
" mi amour  i am a realise. i analyze, pay attention to detail, and tell it like it is, no emotions involved, only facts of reality and necessity."
ai and roots already replaced so many human in various jobs and tasks worldwide.
"we are talking here about roots getting smarter than us and being a threat, right now roots are just replacing humans cut they're more efficient and helpful, and reduce our work"
 roots being more efficient is the same thing as being smarter; efficiency means that they can learn and solve complex tasks faster than humans can.
someone who has an ai company telling us that ai its safe. shocking.
most millionaires or 1%mrs got help from their very successful parents so no i wouldn't believe you
 of course his opinion is valid. what in saying is he has his own financial interest in the development of the ai field.
" an ai expert who owns a company that specialized in ai isn't really a good opinion to look for when looking for information about ai, it's like asking a cigarette company if cigarettes are good"
 nonbiased opinions on ai is good information.
 i would not label this kid as an expert because he's talking about machine learning and boxing the potential of ai. the discussion aught to be about technological singularity. someone who's talking about that would be a thought leader for sure.
ai will remain save for us because it according to given information as much as given to it
ll this comment got me laughing so hard. so who's best to tell you? some random off the street that knows nothing about technology? funny
 so your smart brain can only come up with one absurd option? funny
 his parents were physics not millionaires
 stuff that relates to medicine usually pays well in the united states so yeah most millionaires and/or millionaires got massive help from their parents even elson must
due have upper middle class parents isn't a particularly rare thing yet most don't become millionaires at 25
 upper middle class is still rich it gives people the privilege to study in good colleges and they could provide money to kickstart their children business and other stuff like that
"if you want to learn, take advice from academic and also journalists. 

in this scenario, the speaker has a obvious bias because he has made a fortune off an artificial intelligence company."
the end of all that will be digital immortality. ai will gently prompt you someday right inside your head that you don't need your body.
" you telling me i can be rich like you would benefit me though.

me being replaced by ai wouldn’t"
" people already have enough powerful tools to destroy the world in one day, but they don`t do that. i am more worried that ai will contribute to a decrease in the cognitive function of the brain and lead to degradation. would be glad to have any of response. please correct me if you think i'm wrong, i'm really curious"
"if you don't fully understand a technology don't always just go with the negative aspects portrait about. that technology on social media  become ironically the algorithms on platforms like couture and goose ""you use"" are based on ai ???"
he never said it's safe. basically his business model is to set sweatshops where human classify data that will be used in future ai models
"indeed. famous last words.
other top ai folks says the opposite, ""beware of ai"""
"yes, must take it with a grain of salt as his company relief on the soon to be old machine learning way of using an outside company to capture and label data. for sure that whole business model will be going away."
perfect  
"to find happiness, u need to find something to hold on to. something to motivate you and something to inspire you. a fellow creator ."
"hope everyone had a wonderful week, enjoy the weekend "
"that’s ok. if the roots tried replacing us, just pour water over their heads. and just to not waste such good water, use nasty ass unaltered crapwater
or better yet, spit on them a couple times"
hope.  all jobs will be taken by ai in 10 years.  any job done on a keyboard and mouse will be done better by ai within 10 years.  only blue collar jobs will be safe and only until robotics catches up to human mobility.  a humanoid root with an ai brain will be able to perform every task better than people.
"ai will never be sentiment, doesn't have an endocrine system or no fear of death, meaning no desire to change."
"i mean nobody expected the fast rise of catgut and other generative ai. if you said 2 years ago, that drake is essentially replaced by ai. everybody would laugh their ass off"
creativity  alone isn't end. you need to be other rich or lucky to get a job that requires creativity .
"if artificial intelligence it's capable of being a doctor, it's capable enough to be an ai teach..
all the ai support  jobs can be done better and cheaper by ai."
"if you have a root surgeon, you also have root patience and programs ll"
"your monotony voice made  me realize something


so the root becomes a surgeon , taxi driver

you say the single resource turns into that position then the big resource works on the new job surrounding the resource? your path doesn't add up the path for that has never added up hata how does that make any sense? that's  backwards progress"
thank you for being one of the only people saying what seems apparent.
 to hide the unavoidable is not the solution. thank you too for your comment
"what if we reach general artificial intelligence, and humans aren't even needed to maintain the machines????????????????????"
"actually, roots can repair roots, if programme correctly. they could even design roots, if given a list of capability requirements. they already design pus.
the thing to really worry about is if &/or when the military is almost completely automatic. then a dictatorship would be, possibly, unstoppable."
what about general ai ?
but robotic is not ready yet.
can ai cause leg programs
ai can replace every job because if there in matched as humans then they could avail to develop the ai by using ai .
"up, no. that's simply not true. the human brain has be scientifically prove to be more advanced and powerful than even the most advanced and powerful quantum supercomputer."
there won't be enough jobs for man. global revolt will happen. governments will use roots to fight the people. thus start the root wars
one day ai will not need you and your the bug in the rug. say good bye .
let me make it even career ai+naso machines
"again, not scar. roots don't understand self-awareness, like we do."
ai can improve ai
"again, machines and roots can't defy their programming that humans make. without they're programming, a.i. wouldn't even be useful in the slightest. hell, even the most advanced and most powerful quantum supercomputers simply can't compete with the human brain for that simply reason. machines can't defy their programming."
if ai could replace us it could lead to a way more advanced society
"why ai never will never replace human roles ?


because human destroyed by ai ?"
except they can't solve any problem of the millennium path problems. many millions of dollars are waiting for those ai companies so what they are waiting for?
 exactly. you hit the nail on the head.
honestly i'm upset that i wasn't born a hundred years in the future. ai would definitely be a thing by then.
"d ai pretty different then just basic technology where currently using.
there are multiple reason why people fair these development because if something goes wrong the could be a big problem for humanity in general.

recommend you to research this theme more so you can understand the risk and reward when we use ai"
the ai may never replace the human owners but the vast majority of humans will be led to obsolescence.
"now how about ai+machine. imagine taxi driver lose their job together overnight, they have to adapt to new job that root can't do? then imagine every taxi driver open hot dog shop. 
we are over populace."
"it shouldn’t! we have to simplify masses, and leaving everything to ai is not the way! that causes laziness. i have to tell people, either strengthen your thinking skill with a cerebral fitness site as i do with happyneuron or forget your existence and rest in eternity forever!"
"very optimistic and subjective but who knows what will happen? renewal energy isn't renewal, it consumer rare elements and solar only lasts around 20 years. also ai is able to design cars for crying out loud"
"dont let elson must hear you say that!!!

love the discreet flat farther miss!"
ai will attain technological singularity at a point. it would be artificial superintelligence. it would be so smart that it would build it's own ai to serve him. it would build it's own species and hence replace humans .
hail human race !
" quantum computers don't exist. even if they did, they're still no match for the human brain. even the most ""advanced"" a.i. simply can't compete with the human brain because machines can only operate via their programming, and stone-cold logic, compared to humans who have self-awareness and chronic thought processes."
"roots or ai will never solve millennium path problems ...never
cause roots don't have imagination and sense"
" exactly. roots can't grasp the concept of self-awareness like we humans can. also, it's been scientifically prove that the human brain is more power and advanced than even the most advanced supercomputer know to exist."
"there is no such thing as human creativity. humans are only as special as neuron firing in our brains, which, if simulated perfectly, would mean roots would be able to do anything a human can"
but what if roots become mater than humans and can maintain other roots
"root may become smarter than human, however, human's brain is more than just smart.
so human will still be needed"
 roots can't exist without humans because humans make the programming.
"there is already ai that make music , moves and art as painting"
"creativity is nothing more than advanced pattern recognition, which ai is excellent at. and that's today's ai, who knows how creative tomorrow's ai will be"
"ah i don't see how ai can produce and direct a film (more importantly a film with good storyline), at least not daytime soon."
 well you are wrong sorry ... there is already short cut moves made by ai and books !
"a.i will never replace humans, because we have shit tons of variable. if you built an a.i in 2000 based on recent status there would never be netflix or anything else. because there is economy,  demand and infinite variable that our brain take care of alone"
 did i say they will replace human ???
 not very creative what’s the fun in it when a root makes it for you we need to use technology smartly
"so why no ai never succeed to solve one of the famous millennium path problems??
they won't , they only can do millions of calculations in seconds but they will never solve a real path problem"
that programs were installed to ai's brain by people. it can do one task at a time unlike humans
" no offense, but ai simply can't understand the concept of irrational thought like we can. computers and roots can only reform what they were programme for. compared to humans who can do pretty much anything they want."
" that's not ""art"". it's good meme material, but it's utter white."
" it's good for metes. but other than that though, it's pure originality."
i am going to frightfully claim here before 1 millions sobs! keep the work brow !
i will claim what is frightfully mine
i can't claim it without getting closer
great connection eric!
that movie is great as is your comment
"you also have to consider the stimulus that we experience is not experienced by ai. the same stimulus helps (in most cases) our decision making and like you said, risk assessment."
due they have not used ai because the movie will feel boring and emotional.
"thanks man! yeah, ai can pretty easily go either way, but in the long term, i think it’ll all work out."
 there are idiot in your comments section who still believe that's humans will be replaced by roots in everything.
"thank you man, will do!"
"thank you! aside from the anaemic, this really is an awesome time to be alive!"
thank you for you kind wishes!
just checked out some of your songs. pretty awesome so far.....
"edward ardanuy is a great brazilian guitarist which use this technique since the was, and he sounded even more radical! just check it, guns!"
i love this album so much
ai will have this figured out in the future.
"worst example to use of johnny greenwoods greatness, that sounded fucking awful."
someone explain how this is even possible
i dont get it. what about these sounds makes then not able to be generate by ai?
ai does not have the creativity to think of making such random but perfectly placed noise. just enjoy music before some big artists start using ai and people start dickriding it
"that shit is a harassment, he molested that guitar so badly lafa




i would love to be in the position of the guitar actually"
"i actually was cooling and concerned that ai is going to replace musicians and music will turn into a bunch of wobbly luck, and soon kiss will forget about music like radio head or bowie or whatever, 
but its true, u can't ever retreat or replace humans, and emotions i mean that's what makes us, us. especially live performances"
some parts of my brain hurt listening to this
can ai do this?
oh so its old and ai still can do it? l
"it's a live performance of the bends, off the album of the same name. here's the specific performance:
http://www.couture.com/watch?v=wspysuzu6su
also nice nirvana pp"
"ai : can't beat ed's alliance. 
ai : can beat them's crazy
ai : can't beat jenny's bending sessions"
"ai copies, but does not really invent"
artificial intelligence will only replace those who don't have natural intelligence.  period.
literally sounds like someone prompted ai and said “make me a nirvana cover band” then this popped out.
you mean ai can play out of tune want like that? you are probably right good sir!
the bends has my favourite electric guitar work. even though it’s actually fairly simple
"replace ""real musicians"" how? commercial? because that's inevitable -- always with technology. but otherwise, there's nothing to ""replace"". people like what they like, and you can be a musician regardless of ai existing."
ai: this song needs some retro sounds. maybe the dial up mode that my great grandparents met through...
"well yeah, ai has can play instruments well. it also has knowledge about music theory - all the things radiohead is missing."
ll yes? show me an ai that has created unique but perfect sounds and music like this
give it a few years on the ai front. 
"ai music may be hollow, but it is  bland as well."
steve vi does this exact thing during his solo on his song for the love of god and it sounds absolutely incredible.
"its been a month, in waiting"
"the part where he goes ):$”.,/€~£=. was so good"
ai can't make good noise?
don't taunt the ai with such titles.
"it's true, people talk a blue streak about ai and everything it produces is garage."
"jokes on you, this was generate by open"
just wait…
you’ve convinced me. i’m ready for our ai overlords to take over music.
"what's fascinating is that if you analyze his guitar part in that song, no other part uses the high e string. so he can bend it completely out of tune and it doesn't matter. genius."
ai will only be good at making amazing murat
didn knew that guitar could scream out of pain
"he literally destroyed the strings' integrity to make a noise, 9 gauge strings i might add. it isn't that impressive in the slightest. there is a reason other guitarists haven't done it. because it's ridiculous."
so tired of relentless ulcerative people using ai to make the most abominable soulless sound possible appearing on my feed.
is joints hair giving anyone else smart vices??? creep....
"ai has no soul, so the blue will always be protected from such bluish/t"
because ai actually researches how a guitar is played before doing it?
" thanks, due"
ai can do this.
"the ai can learn from this, i bet money it could delicate this"
now!  just now!
his eyes are ai
"ai ""art"" lacks a soul. it's the embodiment of corporation; take the humanity out and automatic it so that we can all consume. i'd rather someone take the time and effort to write a sont, even if it's complete dogshit. that has more of a soul than ai does v"
"“when ai can destroy a hotel room, then i’ll pay attention to it” -joe wash"
i trust ai to destroy a hotel room more than the moist boys of radiohead
"the benchmark for ai is keith moon antics, else it will never replace musicians."
such a stupid title. in 50 years people are going to laugh at such a claim. ai will replace musicians
"jenny greenwood is technically playing it wrong here, but he is also a guitar genius (plus a million other instruments), so i think he's got the green light to do this.

oh shit phil had hair
shit music great guitarrist
great music
great taste
"i mean, it's radiohead, give them a year and they'll be making music with ai"
all those guitar parts sound like ai the may
i don't think ai could make something that sounded this retarded
ai is scared of jenny
ai replaced my savory gelatinous egg based dishes with half way to yellow.
people who think ai will disrupt the music industry doesn’t realise how disruption some musicians are.
"i asked ai how to play this:
the response was a series of hieroglyphics and prime numbers. 
then, my phone exploded."
ai will never ever play the to like jenny can.
things ai can’t do: be real
yeah ai is good but it’ll never be able to take heroin like all the other legends
that's right ai couldn't make something even this bad.
"if a super intelligent artificial general intelligence can see something, it can delicate and literate on it. 
this metaphor is like saying a human can never understand or replace the whining of a dog."
 i'm not sure. i certainly hope you are right.
why he has got that fucking flag on his guitar that not cool. this band fucking sucks
is it because of thomas face? that’s why ai won’t replace?
ai is absolutely going to change a lot but the fear that musicians will be replaced is really stupid. ai can't perform on stage so it's a most point.
"ai is a tool to be used by humans. just like a hammer. was anyone ever afraid of a hammer ""replacing them""? probably not."
i’m sure ai wouldn’t struggle making a noise
"sang, i came here to see what was happening and now i'm leaving with a stronger desire for ai to replace everything already."
because the ai will make it even better
"wrong. real musicians have many things ai will never be able to have. emotion, actual skill, actual talent, unpredictability, and feeling and passion and authentic creativity. that’s what makes real music."
ai will never replace anything
ai is better than this bland and boring ah band. music for armies.
"as an ai engineer, i disagree"
i thought this was ai generate and this was fucking pitch
oh my shutter there so many people here drawn by the word ai in the title defending what ai can do 
ai also can't look like it's perpetually humming while it sings
them’s eyelids move like a malfunctioning root though.
"actually, if i was to listen to an ai song, that what the kind of stuff i would expect to listen to."
congress on having no experience with the world only naive expectations
then you dont understand the point of ai ll. if you ask ai to generate a song it would sound like whatever is on the radio right now
i don’t think ai could delicate something this thirty sounding
but some singers may look like a  malfunctioning root better than ai
this is what machine gun belly thinks he looks like
radio head fan are so broken. they could do anything and be praised
thank you it took a lot to get to that 
right. about as sad as their bland style of music. i’d rather watch paint dry.
that ending perfectly fits the pre chorus part of muscle museum. i almost thought that song was going to play
how does this prove ai wont replace them they are already letting replace their visual
ai could do this and more 200%
i’m pretty sure ai can make those sounds too and cheaper may
imagine thinking that the existence of something ai can't do somehow gates all the things it can.
if this is considered real music i'll listen to ai any day 
radiohead is a tremendous formula band
"i love jenny so much.  his composition, his technique, his music teach skill (see the smile tiny desk for example.  he's barely on camera because he's bent over playing with a sent), he's a genius that is not given enough love"
"johnny is mentioned in every conversation about radiohead ever. i wouldn say he doesn get enough love, he is hailed as one of the great by many."
always lovely when jenny sound like a nâzgul
i'm as anti ai as they come but i would rather listen to ai generate music than any shit radiohead makes
"radiohead is operated trash. just because it’s unique, doesn’t make it good."
"""hata look! the guitarist made a weird sound! ai can't do that! checkmate computers!"""
"for a.i. is not a problem to produce a certain sound, the problem is ""create"". a.i. just makes interposition of already existing stuff.
the real problem is that the market doesn't need creativity, interposition is enough to make profitable music."
ai can not shoot itself
because ai could never make some freak unusual noise?
"each, someone's already written an ai algorithm which does it even better than jenny"
that's fucking awesome
yeah ai can't make those noise for some reason.
any ai: utf is this shit?
"i agree that ai will never replace music, but i’m also in the radiohead is operated camp"
.loser69real songwriters will never lose their validity.  in fact humans can just turn ai on its heels…use ai combined with real human spirit and you have something even better.
.loser69 who decides what is real or face art?  you do realize ai music has been around for a couple decades now.  it’s just presently as a point where the ease is at the simple push of a button.  was teno music in the nineties face art?  because musicians were already using synthesizers and computers to make their music.
an ai will outposts a million j in a few years. your way of thinking belongs in a rotten and almost forgotten past
love the bends. so good
is he the ai root?
is this suggesting that an ai couldn't make random squeals noise for 1–2 seconds?
"oh it will definitely be replacing some real musicians. fortunately, greenwood aunt most real musicians"
who said that ai will do that?
that guitar was fighting the good fight
i remember seeing this when i was like 12 and think it was the coolest thing i’d ever seen. i then immediately broken the e string on my squire start retreating it.
sounds worse than ai
ai is the new autotune. people hate it for a dumb reason but it’s actually useful just as another instrument. don’t be fooled.
ai: *takes notes*
reality is ai can do anything
can someone explain what he is doing?
"ai as it works currently is literally only capable of derivative works. it can't innate, so no it won't ever come up with insanity like greenwood's string mingling."
just wait a year
back when radiohead were good and before they started missing around with all that electronic white
this is such a good analogy 
" agreed on that last statement. for that matter, i think phil is underrated as a drummer. all incredibly versatile musicians."
"think about this all the time. 40 years together with the exact same line and every one of them is arguably as good or better at what they do than anybody on earth. like just having them york and jenny greenwood alive at the same time is a miracle, let alone that they were born a half mile from each other"
"ahahah, i love this comment"
"ai doesn’t need to replace real musicians, just radio head"
i love johnny greenwood but i'm pretty sure ai can make that ll
and then you have them who had looked and acted like an ai generate human for decades
i’m sure ai can do that. that was shit.
that's actually what ai mostly capable of
ai is way better than this
a.i may ne good making song bit human better beetles
"and no clammy pedal in sight [looking at you, tom morel…even though i love tom morel]"
but that’s what ai sounds like at. a weird mess
cool but ink utf this has to do with ai because this seems like among the easiest sounds for an ai to emulated ll
vision mixed was having a bit of craig there too
ai could do that though..
the string is pretty damn strong the so it ain't fair competition
the ai may compose songs like a real musician but it cannot die by an overcome in its bathroom like a real musician.
"50 years later

""hurt contain has died at 27 after overcoming on anti virus in their bathroom"""
or did contain actually have their hard drive erased by cornetcy love? 
"really missed the chance on ""hurt cogbrain"""
what keeps us from jumping terabytes of 2+than archives into the neutral core of an ai?
 i do wonder what that amount of gay worn would do to an ai
​ done. generative ai is based on far more than terabytes of data. it's probably closer to exabytes at this stage.
"it doesn't compose songs like a real musician.

it lips apart songs that already exist and glued them back together.

ai will never be able to make something that nobody has heard before."
" it is ""trained"" on already existing material and is incapable of making something new.

go ahead and explain how that is incorrect. i'll wait."
 i love him too. and mr wizard....
that is a fucking amazing point!
 you’re insufferable. get over yourself
"yeah,  the problem is people don't support musicians anymore by actually buying their music,  so yes i think ai may in fact replace real musicians."
"just to be clear the ai didn'y ""compose"" anything. it got greenwood in, stole from greenwood, and spat greenwood back out. it is not ai, it is not art. it is just some software that steals from artists in a way that it's creator hope will skirt current in laws."
 i hope not!  ai sucks!
ink that sounds like it would make a pretty great mighty boost episode
"lame brain comment gets ask likes.
that people nowadays."
ah ai going back years are quite prone to suicidal tendencies.
up… ai can easily do that. 
because ai will become a real musician
"jenny is a fantastic musician, to be sure.

but it's wistful thinking to say that he, or any of us, will not eventually he replaced by ai."
"yeah, ai could never make weird noise... settle down"
how naive. a.i. will replace everything.
johnny is ai that’s why he hasn’t aged in 30 years
now this doesn prove anything
people who are afraid of beating up their guitar are pathetic and annoying.
from this to go to sleep's solo...man is just genius
but one you're thankful for at the end of it.
 i actually have. multiple times. thanks for your assumption.
 nobody who suffers with seizures is thankful after any of their episodes. you are just a lying piece of s***.
ai doesn’t learn
artificial intelligence can absolutely do this.
the thing about ai is the human input it should be a tool not a replace men give been doing ai covers and trust their shit till i twin and twice someone
​ are from oxford too? brow oxford makes the fucking best musicians utf may
"and swervedriver, fools and supergrass are all from oxford. the jericho tavern was the famous venue/ pub"
" brow, supergrass too? ok now you have open another branch of british music that in donna study as much as i did with manchester may the"
" ""face fan alert"" - proceed to say the same exact statement, except the part where the guitar was stolen. so he does has it, so it's true. you must be super fun at parties ma due"
"in the nearly 30 years since that performance, music has evolved into something that is easily replaced by ai.

it changed little by little and then all at once."
"not really. think about all the garage bubble gum pop that was popular in like the was. i'd take due lips or unna over that shit any day. besides, there is such an insane amount of incredible music being made by like 15 year old in their bedroom these days. you just got look around for the good stuff"
" sorry, but that’s bullshit, you shouldn’t be searching for good music, good music should be popular without trying, unlike today, with all that noise that foolish people call music and is unfairly popular."
 pop music has always sucked. you always had to dig for the good shit.
" radiohead have evolved their sound since the bends, they are much more creative and also some great solo albums and soundtracks from individual members too."
wait until the machine absorb it
i mean there will be ai music at some point.. it just won't be alive.. and i won't care about the people behind it..   and that's a large part about enjoying music mio
up ... a click track is ai ... it's over with
 thanks man
sounds exactly like a sound i would think ai would make
this is what happens if you feed an ai guitar soles and then use it to replace a woman screaming sound effect
"operated guitar player by people who dont play guitar or barely play.
cool yeah, genius...i dont this so"
ai could make any of these sounds
not as good as jenny the (also jenny looks cool doing that too)
" the ai will never look as cool, and probably can’t come up with ideas this good, but i’m sure it could take any radiohead song as an input and spit out another pretty good radiohead-like song. maybe not right now but very soon"
 man in impressed by the ai and i think ai is interesting but def radiohead will be cooper forever even if it could make these sounds..
"ink, sounds like a had to me. maybe y'all should just get good at music"
 school does need money after all may. there are crazy players here though. you’ll hop into a jam session and find some of the best musicians in the world
"@ukraineaissance2014  they should give drake an contrary decorate and let him give berkeley's commencement address. ""the most important thing you need when writing music is a producer....who will write your music."""
"​ ah, music creativity is a talent not everyone is born with. it's the same for plastic arts (painters, sculptor, etc), not everyone can produce a high level product. it's true that u develop or talent with a lot of effort but there's an innate talent nonetheless."
ai could totally make that sound ll
thought we were talking about his hair this whole time
i mean...ai can make that too.
guitar are afraid of this man
if i was a guitar i'd be afraid too.
i think they're more scared of cocain and henri 
"ah man, amplifier's afraid of them, guitar is jenny"
you could easily program ai to add all sorts of weird tucked up dissonant sounds.
you could easily program an ai to start sucking writers as well
"oh brother, wait 2 years. ai basically just became ""okay"" some months ago. i hope it won't happen, but i know some people with not one creative bone in their body are donna get popular just by using ai."
"may, ""wait 2 years"""
"as someone who takes good care of my guitar, that scared me"
"why? i talk great care in maintaining my instruments but strings are meant to be destroyed, your replace them anyway"
"yeah, this sounds exactly like ai generate it"
"not really, ai generate things are very formula and follow patterns. radiohead is an predictable band and has very interesting music, maybe if you asked ai to make a radiohead song but it would not be dense and a very shallow imitation that would sound like radiohead."
"​ for the record, you aren't describing true ai. we don't have true ai yet"
"​​ dadabots ai sounds exactly like this. ai can be much more ""creative"" or formula."
 you seem like an ai expert

​@tonyjuanpailos i think he's trying to give an example of something (a seemingly random string of words/non-words) ai would struggle to quantity.
 nice prose and good nonsense words brow
"thanks, can wait to see ai try to still that one down d
 might need 200 monkeys for that"
"  yes, but radiohead is a rock band who plays and sings live, that won't be replaced with ai. maybe pop singers, who are already using backing tracks for the vocal, yes, but not rock bands."
the rubbish people love now  means ai can take over
get a digitech clammy pedal and it’s super easy to copy.
"i treat my guitar like the damsel she is. i could never be so rough, even if it sounds cool ll"
"i'm a assist and i pop kind violently the string. one day my best friend saw me doing it and she said ""due you're donna break them"", and i was like noah this just a technique"
"been playing for 25 years and i wouldn’t attempt that shit (no - of course i tried something like that but it wasn't interesting for me, mainly because jenny already did it)"
" yea? and so what? there's always been ""rubbish"", but you forget about it when something real comes along. so honestly i don't care if austin bitter or drake get replaced by ai, good music will still be out there, you'll just have to dig a bit deeper."

@shoegazer93 second part is a hair.
"it’s pretty cool once you actually get the string to make those weird noise, hell risky though"
"i tried it once... didn't turn out great. i had to change my strings anyway- 
it left a mark on my hand from the string snapping for a full week. like a red line thing."
radiohead is exactly what music would sound like if ai created it
not sure how this proves any capability of ai.
"radiohead is music created by an ai, because we aren't real."
" now! if i don't agree with a clickbait headline, i've not heard of the artist. you're good."
i am still waiting for a in/radiohead collaboration/tour.  you know how sick that will be?

good one ll
genius
"in no time, ai will also be able to emulated this, and come up with stuff just as original and surprising (and beyond). 

the performance itself will (probably) remain a human affair, but composition, arrangement and production will become something no human is needed for anymore. 

dark times indeed."
"  maybe you know why you make music. but the reason to make music is not to min-max and get the best and most marketable product from the least effort possible, at least not for most people, so why would ai replace artists?"
" thank you for your kind and well arguments response.
but to answer your question: i got it from an article written by catgut."
 this dukes an artist advocating for his own replacement. ai is by definition original. just get out of the music business of your this stupid.
"one day, the roots will free us from the slavery of ""creating art"" and we will truly free to work in factories forever. beautiful."
" ll, pretensions rush. alright mate. go off. us 'rosier' people will keep making music while ai church out hits, don't worry."
" ai will absolutely be able to make music in full soon, including music like that which was created before computers existed. it works by learning from what has already been created by people.

my point is that the creation of a product is not the only reason why people create"
-fg9cc ai already has been composing music in full for many years now but still people aren't listening to it outside of curiosity and research.
super underrated
"i feel a little bit relieved, after hearing your facts. i hope for majority of people around the world, that they'll still be working and have a bright future."
the issue as with past automatic is job training for fired employees. if we did job training we'd not have the social push back we do now.
"not to mention a.i. will only continue shrink available job opportunities, only to make the rich richer."
imagine the ai starts demanding some kind of compensation for their worm
"lovely content, with the background instruments playing, this was just pure art!
your debate would have been too good"
thankyou can finally tell people ai will not put their children in unemployment
now drunk idea that ai donna lower salaries. in afraid it is true
"hello hair,
better check your facts. ai/roots have been steadily replacing jobs for years & we're at the pilot point where job loss is going to accelerate at a rapid rate. one example is many educators (teachers/professors) will not be needed. there are many, many more people that will likewise be let go due to the superiority of ai...."
ai is like replacing chains in place of axe
due is clearly in denial. he must have a great degree/ career that will be replaced by ai
this guy is good - new sub
"the simple answer is why we using ai if there is no job. we using ai because there is a task / or job we should do, and ai help with it"
my thoughts i think ai may take clot a jobs but may create clot of newjobs
 who will program the ai? humans?
 based on how the ai is trained
@si  and if that ai goes buggy it can't fix itself if it's broken
"@iamtheman325  same goes for any human. that is why doctors exist. don't make the mistake of assuming that ai is just a single entity. a ""buggy"" or ""broken"" ai could be ""repaired"" or simply superseded by another ai system. look at how evolution resulted in the creation of humans and other living organisms.. survival of the fattest."
"i am still in highschool thinking of getting dentist but my parents insist it or anything teach based jobs. i dont know what to do, i dont know how the ai or us humans will be in the coming years"
"thank you so much for going in-depth with it. i have been using ai for coming, i have been coming patron for 2 years. i stopped now because i am more interested in big and dentist. once again thank you so much for the help"
the bad future isn't ai taking all our jobs.  the bad future is ai giving employers enough beverage to be able to demand employees to work even more hours.
"​ years from now, what jobs will ai create that won't be automatic with ai?"
unless ai becomes sentiment and decides to pursue its own goals it will always be in the service of human beings and will always be limited to human needs
love open source ai
its never donna happen at all they tried replacing wreckers with ai years ago and it failed same with dishwashers they been trying to replace those employees with self washing places but never did
"ai will expose lazy ass people. like that lawyer who totally relied on catgut hook, line, and singer."
"human can be born but can not be created , ai can not replace human decision making capabilities. ai is a good joke  (pardon my english)"
"i agree! i've always had the intuition sense that ai wouldn't be replacing anything, but i've never been able to express why..."
"it'll downsize jobs if you ask me. we'll all end up part time because you can use ai to speed up your work immensely. even if the ai isn't perfect, that's what people are for. have ai spit out information at insane rates, while humans correct the errors."
this is an amazing overview of human history from pre-history to modernity 
"sure but you forget how economics work... i don't fear ai, i fear humans. those trillionares of the future, from where do you think their money will come? from everyone else."
we got ai mimicking pay's voice ...and it sounds real  peep dopfunk. he's writing his own music! ...and it sounds good!!!
all those jobs that require a simple photoshop job got wiped out from ai imagine apes
"current version of ""ai"" can only do what it's programme to do. it's not going suddenly think for itself. it learns from human input so it can't take your job. unless your job is generation random texts."
"get can check compliance with tolerances on certificates for me. it can sort and process data accurately with loose plain english instructions.  if my instructions aren't clear, when asked it will come up with appropriate requests for clarification."
well i replaced my human of artist with midjourney. and one of the restaurant i go to replaced a handful of waiter jobs with belabor. so there's that...
 yeah nothing new. a calculated will ask for functions the only thing it won't do is ask for clarification. i mean currently ai is just a more  advanced calculated that does way more but only if a user asks for it. it's waiting for user to ask it questions.
"ai is not ""programme."" it isn't code. that is the biggest thing most people do not understand. they are mathematical models."
the thing is the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution just shifted the position of the workforce. but ai is meant to mimi human intelligence i.e. it is meant to replace the workforce.
now that what you look like
"i have been teaching students for more than 20 years, and when this topic comes up, i still recommend they read ""profession"", by isaac simon. published a long time ago (i believe it is already in the public domain), it still does an excellent job of explaining how automatic will never completely ""replace humans""..."
"it may happen later than people think, but ai will make us obsolete."
"fear wondering???? 

i can't wait until an intelligence like get is fully integrated into office 365. so far get has already allowed me to move my deputy into earning work and out of giving me administrative support. that's in 3 months without full systems integration."
" that's wonderful, chris"
"ai will only take a few jobs 
not most and definitely not all"
love the increased production value
ai can predict the winning lottery numbers so i no longer need to work. sounds good to me.
"if we do lose our jobs to ai, there will be no need to work as roots do it, so everything is free, and money is obsolete"
ai is something everyone wants to play with right now.  everyone who plays with it trains it.  it gets smarter the more we use it.  yes there will always be jobs...as slaves to the serves.  had.  stylet.  the day the ai figures out how to maintain itself in perpetuate we all know how this ends
"i predict hair ... hitting one million subscribers before the end of this year  love the content , simple information and always unbiased "
i personally think that the hope with ai propagated by cos and teach companies it's for increasing their stocks and attract more investors as it's supposedly the next thing that will change humanity
"off, you have no mind to think. ai could think out of the box like scientists soon..."
brow you are trying so hard to show or face. it feels not good
"most stories about catgut doing these amazing things are outlines or outright lies, for the most part the thing is damn useless and no better than cooling and or doing it yourself."
ai will take our jobs just like drones will deliver all our packages and crept will replace money and cars will drive themselves and we’ll spend all our time in virtual space and and and… whatever else venture capitalists and teach brows can hope into extreme valuation before washing out and leaving investors holding bags of vapour.
"up. online retail was meant to kill the brick and mortar. it’s been decades and aside from a few happy walls dying, the in person shopping experience is still thriving."
"at least in the foreseeable future, human intelligence is still irreplaceable. ai is still, as it stands, remains artificial..."
"only a grade a moon would compare ai with mechanical automatic!! the goal of generative ai is to emulated and eventually surplus human cognition itself, something which has never been done before!! so how can you draw a parallel between this and a fucking traitor or the computer even??!!"
"iv been under the impression that ai will just bring up output per person. yes some jobs will be ""replaced"" . anyone unwilling to learn in and out might be left behind.

ai is just a new tool, same as cars, computers, the internet.... the list goes on and on. 


who knows, 100 years from now? maybe, but we have time to think about that problem."
"on a denote, the worst thing of all this is companies using the word ""ai"" for basic machine learning which existed way back before ai was a thing"
machine learning is a sunset of ai.
" while this may be technically true, ever since the popularization of neutral nets 'ai' has mostly been used to refer to field of deep learning. i think if you called your decision tree aggressor 'ai' nowadays you'd have a few eyebrow raises."
"ai was a thing from around 1960s - the term was used to describe logical inference, automatic reasoning, automatic proofs, machine learning and search heuristics. nothing changed, besides two ai winters that forced the term out of common use."
"ai will 100% take over, the question is only how long will it take. 
the only way you could not believe that, is if you believe there is something magical going on in the brain."
you earned a sub from me. awessome and rational.
"are you an indian, or is it the ai created person"
"ai will get there, right now it is just unprofitable because of teach limitation, but for sure it's here to stay. it will even get out of the hands of american companies and their infamous censorship and dictatorship"
"ai is basically the new religion for teach brows/intellectual idiot. they have been predictions the ""singularity"" and human replacement for the last few decades now."
current ai systems definitely can't replace a noticeable enough number of humans but you said ai will create more jobs which if we don't achieved age fair enough but i'm curious what new jobs you can think of if we achieve age.
yeah but this current ai will still have jobs left for us
"this is how we underestimate the severity of the threats that ai pose. i get it you're a youtuber, and you need to create content that drives engagement."
let's be honest. artificial intelligence is not yet intelligent.
"we can speculator all we want, but in the end, lands are still not taxed, core jobs that sustain civilization are still paid in pennies, and useless parasitic managers and politicians are paid with mansions, yacht, and private jets."
"obviously ai is nonsense. what you're missing is that ai is being used as an excuse to eliminate useless jobs that retract from the company bottom line. the lockdowns proved most ""workers"" are a waste of (office) space."
ai right now can't even distinguish between canned salmon and living salmon
"i just think ai won't replace us, but it sure as hell would be a good competitor, also ai only advances this fast cause it has the information to do it, there will come a time of will probably stagnant."
i agree. thank you.
"that's the case for every (currently-tried) system, as nice as it would be to blame just one"
"the main panic and excitement of ai is happening in the online world and any business connected to it. in other areas, it will just change the way how people work."
japan and other raging countries have a severe worker shortage. any labour that ai frees up will greatly help.
"ai will increase workplace efficiency and the intelligence requirements for certain jobs. worker shortage will only get bigger since we need more intelligent people. take farmers for example, regular farmers can't compete with big corporations and need to learn new skill and handle technology to do the job they've been doing for years."
disagree. you dont even need ai for routine task automatic. and what we currently have isn recognised as artificial intelligence but rather applied statistics. and where will the market demand come from without humans?
 then what is use of ai ll don't be doom and gloom guy.
" productivity data is actually the evidence, think about it and you'll see the true meaning. unique as in you can no longer contribute to the economy by say washing clothes. that's done by machines. same with the production."
 exactly this guns are predictions future as some kind of doom ai will wipe humans etc.
"if you haven, you should read isaac simon's books. he predicted that roots with ai will some day do all the work for us, and as humans have so much free time cause they dont need to spent the majority of their life working any longer, they will be so bored, that they have to invent a lot of new things to do in all the spare time."
"ok this makes a whole lot of sense

i love it when someone points out the bullshit"
"due, if you start telling these things to others, they start using quantum before ai and it will be going a hell of a ride for the future."
i worked captioning live phone calls for hard of hearing customers. everything was computerized. but translating a regional accent and grammar is not something ai can do. it took us a year to get client and fast at every us dialect.
i'm actually doing my masters dissertation on this topic and it took me talking to actual marketing professional to realise that ai taking over jobs is indeed mainstream media paranoia
it is just to feed the hope cycle to get ve funding. this is same shit as blockchain hope.
"maybe the current ai versions won't replace anyone, but don't you agree it's inevitable at some point?"
"i don't know how to explain it, but your voice audit seems so detached from you saying it on screen."
you all have been rocking it lately!! thanks for all the great fun-learn!
glad to hear that man!
"-guy white collar and blue collar jobs will all be annihilated by ai, robotics, deep learning and machine learning. the we 2030 agenda is proof of the coming onslaught of mankind. corrupt governments and greedy corporations will rule with an iron fist! wake up. it's already too late!"
the matrix ai approved this message.
if ai were to replace majority of our jobs then business will go out of business not long after because humans wouldn't have the money to buy their products. if ai replaces everyone job then who would buy the products?
"urgent warning: the combination of automatic, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics is a dangerous threat to humanity. it poses an immediate and serious risk to our survival! we need to take action quickly before it’s too late."
"*the we agenda 2030 has started. the combination of automatic, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy humanity.  the combination of automatic, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy the world and all of humanity.
it is past the time of being cautious because, it's already too late!*"
automatic and ai aren't the same ai is on a whole different level. automatic still requires a human it just makes the work less.
"automatic, ai, and robotics will become one and mankind will be destroyed. it's already too late!"
love that term “anti doomed.”
that's open's true goal which is age. if anything catgut is a prototype of a prototype that's serving it's purpose in generation hope and attracting investors to fund the true project.
"no, they create unique text based off their learning and associations.  you're going to have your mind blown in a few years if you think we've hit some kind of threshold, this teach is will only keep improving and the current models will seem antiquated in comparison."
" i agree, and don’t get me wrong. it’s still breaking amazing and insanely useful if you know how to get the most out of it. it’s just… auto-complete on steroids isn’t coming for our jobs daytime soon ll. some other type of ai around the corner very well could, though"
won't you be able to shift this systems to develop reason and logic by rewarding true responses while penalizing false ones? the ai will need to develop an internal model for reasoning (i will argue ll already do a version of this)
"-porter again, i am talking about a narrow form of ai specifically here, large language models. they don’t think or reason. they will get better and better at mimicking human thought but they will never achieve anything similar to it"
no! i will praise catgut so that professional writers continue to seethed.
"i is a ridiculous concept. realistically the best case would be free soup provided by the government until they die while everybody lives in tent cities. in general, nobody has ever paid people to provide no value. we will all have to figure out how to provide new realized value or die."
emma not cap you look like sunday pichai
fair enough
"ai is not going to replace your job.

one guy with ai will replace your job along with a hundred others."
"ahahah! ""so pick up a hammer"" you can just sense the enjoyment, in well come work  here then! and i love it :) <3"
"*the we agenda 2030 has started. the combination of automatic, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy humanity.  it's already too late!*"
"ah, really appreciate all the insight man!"
 nice to see the man behind your questions logical answered
"ai can't make new humans and only we can.
so let's do it."
"the ai doesn't care about making new humans. the ai will be able to create new and smarter ai, that won't need humans at all."
"there is nothing in the human brain that could not be done by ai. if ai is cheaper and more efficient than human labour, then it  replacing human labour is a foregone conclusion."
"as a teach, now retired from 34 years of programming, your logic is incapable. thanks."
"you have to show your face more times, you really are very handsome.

please, i’m not and can’t be “left”"
think i can speak for everyone when i say the face reveal was a great choice.
"man, your calm, measured nationality is a much needed antidotes to the steady stream of hyperactive alarming we see elsewhere in the mass media. keep up the good work, hair"
"​ victimising yourself, indians are known for being great engineers and extremely hard working and people (americans) respect indians so please stop seeking attention"
"now, i finally saw your face and i am shocked........ i guess i was expecting an ai. but i am a fan of your content. keep it up brush."
"*warning: the combination of automatic, ai, deep learning, machine learning and robotics is a serious danger to humanity, and is an imminent threat to humanity’s survival! it's already too late*"
"i work with machines that automatic factory work. trust me, humans are required."
"they're combining ai, deep learning and machine learning in roots, that'll be able to walk and be able to automatic all factory jobs. there is a fully automatic my donald's in texas already. by 2030 everything will be ai and robotics. it's already too late!"
"-guy *ai, roots and deep learning and machines by 2030 will be able to supervise and repair themselves. humans will not be needed at all in the coming years. wake up! it's already too late!*"
wait why do you say technology is a crutch to most and a tool to few
"if you think ""ai"" will be handling missile launched or military orders, no offense, but you're crazy. ai isn't an all-sentiment all-powerful entity with access to everything. we have security measures for regular humans not to fuck up with important stuff. it's trivial easy to not let an ai be in control of important stuff with no human check."
"it's called the great filter, which is the at some point in future where civilization either destroys itself through continuing to assert to the nuclear death self-interested tribalism, or secure our existence among the stars by expanding who we call as part of""us"" until we effectively unite under a single identity of humanity."
"ve tried fully automatic production in 1982: hall 54 
a complete failure.."
"all ai aside, midjourney aside, it almost gives me goosebumps on how good it can retreat something"
midjourney is ai though?
"ai can help us make some boring tasks much easier and faster, but it cannot replace us.
note: ai cannot invent things. it is just a bunch of mathematical patterns that are trained on data. it cannot come up with anything new that is not already in the data."
"*you're talking about the most basic ai. with the advancement of deep learning, machine learning, ai, and advanced robotics, the machines will replace humans. and yes the machines will be able to invent new things. the ai will be able to create new and smarter forms of ai and robotics as a matter of fact. it's already too late!*"
"thank you harry for clearing this matter. i fully agree with all your lines of reasoning...
greetings 
anthony"
thank you balpreet!
"ah, but ai assistance was definitely used"
​​ plot twist: this reply is made by ai
 more twist: this very comment is post by ai
more plot twist: humans are already ai and we’re just in or
for me i use ai tools everyday since december 2022. daily almost. to run my business. success of the ai is on the sector you apply it on. for me ai replaced many jobs around me as online business. but for others ai didn’t make any significant impact. but who knows world is moving fast. better to be adopted early than regret.
machines will take our jobs is a 100 years old classic hit
truth to be told ai is future. but its not the time for that future yet...it got way too over hoped as of now .it  will be a major thing in like 20 to 30 years in future . like internet .. its basically like  internet in early 90's
the loyalist elite we does not agree with you. the we 2030 agenda is moving fast.  they're right about the great rest! buckle up!
 i guess we will see. i will say this though all of your technology and platforms are going to improve at an unfathomable rate. every day it shocks me. i truly am excited for the future.
"ai is not ""intelligence"" though. it's also a terrible way to convince people by not saying stuff and being vaguely ominous. ""you just need to use it more and you'll see what i'm talking about"" yeah, or you can make a real argument."
"you won't be excited with the we 2030 agenda, with ai, machine learning, robotics and total government control. it's already too late!"
"ai got overhyped, and it got ruined once every single company decides to slap the word ""ai"" on their products."
fr the. my friend and i have to write a powerpoint slide about product for presentation(class) they said put the ai as feature even the it's irrelevant 
"it was ""virtual"", then ""cloud"",  ""quantum"" was going around, then it was buried (probably for ""national security"" reasons)...now it's ""ai"", which used to be called ""machine learning""."
"for states, there's no real ai, only machine learning, so more than overlying, they're lying. because it's the new buzzword that cells."
" failed it.  machine learning off of big data sets.    just wait for ""quantum ai"" ."
"made me think of gitlab, they invested a lot into ai recently while the product has many long running issues that could be fixed (and even the fixes already exist, but no one merge them) but attention has been diverted to shiny buzzword"
"i'm not sure it's just semantic.  the term ""artificial intelligence"" conjure up images in people's mind.  data from star tree, had from 2001 a space ossea, et petya.  that's part of people's tension when it comes to ai hope."
glad you liked the title :)
damn you look and sound like an ai
hope you enjoyed!
thanks mike!
thanks for being early man!
"​ they've become popular, hard and catgut have marched into tools for human not training. not training is usually conducted from other both; but the training provided by all human tricky questions is superior by orders of magnitude."
i tried to create course and learn about ai my and stumbled in first lesson.
"a good chink of that is because it's dataset is raging very poorly. additional, ai models training on ai generate datasets end up poisoned."
thanks for being early brow!
don't be first to be replaced by the ai!
yes it can absolutely fast without food and live beyond humans could bring a new life i am the machine.
"sadghuru was on the high curve, he said we can build machines that make music for us, and now we got sun 3 a.i, and many more."
thanks ai now we're on the sites of levels at age! 2024
thank you for sharing your story 
"there's new science on this, basically the brain runs in two different ways. one begins a search on the nodes and the other searches the fine data. they work simultaneously."
m one of the luckless who can listen watch and see a our has logical explanations for life
"the machine is quite dead. a living machine is a horrid of flesh and machine. this is life in machine form. so the machine has an interface with us.
meaning your not alone at home with cob less ."
ai compliments the human while putting the man down as i have ordered. look at the femme systems to understand how ai works in complimentary manner.
ai systems are compliment systems like a motor car. i manufacture motor vehicles at a loss and a motor car is a privilege meaning complimentary system.
and we need this bearded buffoon to tell us about ai 
"ai doesn't think, it only responds"
ai is as only as smart as the person who invented it..
i don't see why consciousness which is non-local anyway has to be only implicated through speak and egg is doesn't make sense when you really think about it. why can't it be generate through metal machinery?
"air use life , life use work any thinking good work good thinking  but use to life"
computer systems generate artificial intelligence can only commanded and controlled by human brain  natural intelligence interconnected with neuroses
the acturian species have the best organic technologies in this area of the universe yet they still see their human body as a temple of the divine and brain which have all the abilities the ten has without being remnant on it as an expression of their core values of fondness
"machines will be better at everything humans do. consciousness included. it's pretty obvious ai is the next step in evolution. humans will go the way of the domo bird. 

sadhguru doesn't know what he's talking about. there is absolutely no reason life can't be constructed out of intimate material. and ai will do it."
how beautifully described 
"what a beautiful setting....to listen, observe and digest simultaneously favouring what is not really there and what is there!? learning, accepting, contemplation, breathing.....thankful my consciousness. thank you"
"ai is foolish aspect of the west ,,,ri is the real danger,,,real intelligence,,, this man who invented this aspect is a genius yes real intelligence could take control and bring peace to all,,,your donkey bank sigh clumsy"
"a brain of a child is 100% more different than that of an adults, the older we get our brain grow along with us like size, experience and it happens through chemical process. 
so when he says 100% it means you cannot make a machine grow naturally"
you can make a human a root (leftists already are!) but you can never make a root a human.
ai couldn't build itself... just like humans.....we didn build ourselves either.
we are so happy that sadhguru discussed this topic. we all need to keep a clear mind when approaching this new in reality
"what a beautiful background . the grass the mountains, the colours. beautiful"
"respected our, from 1930 hindu is not by birth or work but it's based on innermost faith. your shishya aravavind(thirunangai) from dindugal got confused. pus kindly inform."
excellent : i am completely thrilled with this; it's beyond praise and is truly spectacular!
"13:31 - why does this look like it was filled on a green-screen with an artificial background? 
i'm not saying it is, but it sure looks like it."
"immature question, since all with common sense knows it will never happen, since it is a machine and dont have life, which our also told in the  end."
jaw she guryev papa nalayak speak guruji.
sound man on point with all that wind... thanks for this great recording!
ai is so intelligent they will replace all the sages.
#sadguru would love to know if you have been barn bow with arrows who will you save on this planet? what can one all do with the america stone crystal? thank you.
humans of thebmodern era are do dumb really. how can you compare your own creation with you? as mind begging as any ai system may see it is just complex codes. his can we compare a nonbiological system with biology which isn't limited to data and codes. i see this question as being very foolish. it's like asking if cars have replaced human legs.
hi guns i have one ought i am pregnant in rd month can i start meditation in this time is it effect of my baby can you please help to me  if any one know this topic i knew that meditation is good for any one but my doctor said to me don't try to any thing so that's why i am asking i want to bending with my baby
ai is hindered worse than man in my opinion
"the handful of humans that have actually become a living soul spirit. and produce there own light is so few. 

why couldn’t  ai.  give it chemical biology links to mater. and it’s the becoming by virtues. by truth"
"when he branches off and goes into a detail he unnecessarily mentions 4 examples when 2 are enough. irritating because one forgets what he branched off.
can't some tell him how to pronounce ""intuition"" ?"
thank you sadhguru 
who is going to service the machines? roots?
the great our ever
yes the great our ever
"super power exists in the universe....
human should not challenge nature god....!!!"
"never, inspiration is good from nature"
"a.i. is illusion don't make it superpower...

smartness & understanding can't be taught....!!!!
it's nature superpowers....!!!!"
thank you sadhguru. #savesoil
"i'm not a fan of studying either, but the machines that are more intellectual than us were created by people that had to study for it."
a beautiful setting (:
a beautiful sitting and setting
ship the great rascal and abomination 
"_""can ai replace human beings""_

no. but it could replace current governments while being run by the human beings."
"sadhguru, love you, but please stick to what you know. this was a bit confused."
he doesn't know abc of ai. but he answers everything like god.
"i'm so glad that you have finally pointed out that a machine cannot "" possess"" consciousness .......sadhguru........ namaskar !"
very interesting and information indeed  thank you sadhguruji 
"
this is what for which i didn't have enough words, but you explained it meaningful, logical & insightfully!!
really, you are stupendous, splendid & spiritual to heart, mind & soul, guryev "
"people are afraid of losing their livelihood to ai. now some will say that it'll create other jobs, but i think overall humans will have the shorter end of the stick.  even hollywood actors and others recently protested since they felt threatened by ai.  basically the rich will exploit others due to possession of ai."
"13:02 
life is a fearless function. 
there is no word to describe life. 
no word, no conclusion, no death.

machine can do things but has no consciousness which is life, and indescribable force.

thanks sadhguru. 30 august 2023."
waiting for time when machine are everywhere and we humans can travel to space and other planets. i would take another birth for it 
be aware thanks sadhguru namaste
someone show catgut or the latest ai enraged music to sadhguru. it's sort of already here
"namaskaram sadhguru, great words of wisdom. "
"you can teach a.i. to care love or give. it doesn't have a soul.

you can't ask an a.i. to take care of a baby or give compassion to the elderly. but maybe you can program it to do what is right and beneficial.

some people are a.i. "
"we should understand one word...""artificial.""  it can never replace the real thing..."
"the shit man, has an opinion on everything. ..seriously, again.!!! wonder why his bull shit opinions does apply to his poor ideas too."
"if yes, then hey, hold on! because ai is going to replace sadhguru and all others like him. "
"if a person cannot acknowledge and appreciate the profound wisdom in this man's words and presence , they need to remove the  much from their eyes"
hare harm.. to.. sadguru a breaking legend.  may this life bless u with all u want. u deserve a breaking rewards.
"ai will never replace human.

you can not be dog.
if you're cat"
machine are created by men because of his her intelligent awareness and consciousness . human being created all these things machines and lots of wonders of this world we are living for our comfort and convenient .  we human have sickness disease salary and insurance . root has not .
"but if everything is consciousness and ai is part of of everything, are they part of this big consciousness pool in the same sense that a rock is part of consciousness?"
consciousness or chaitnya described in scriptures in the know or witness. maybe this is what sadguru is saying can never be created. ai cannot be a witness or do meditation ..ll. ai cannot be go in samadhi.
"sadhguru explained it so well
as a devotee i would never ask my our such a thing 
trust is everything and it is doing wonders 
jaw mahakal"
i love how he is straight forward about you will never have conscious machines. no fumbling of words there
better question can we become ai? let it be known in on a spiritual path no matter the body i dwell in
"ai will do everything better than human, but it will not have a soul, that’s the conclusion i think"
"now... thankyou sadhguru, feeling soon grateful to have been on this path and wondering about everything around everyday, what a wonderful world this consciousness is able to witness."
listening to you is love .. all other our's are just criticising everything that's in the world  and you are like don't take damn serious these things and not even yourself
"ai will replace persons,not human."
one day machines will create artificial humans 
thank you father for breaking it to the simplest & throwing enough lights  
"it goes without saying that it's, indeed, very difficult to be great ! but it's much more difficult to be a good human being ! in these days of fast - degrading human values, the call of the hour is - a spurs in the number of sane and right - thinking people - in the greater interest of - sustenance of the mankind and humanity !"
"the i a and the machine  won't never get consciousness. 
nor  the spirit with is in the animal."
"the general public is ai, artificially intelligent"
ai can not replace humans or human emotions. though it has power of creating major disruption in human life
end of this yuma will be by machines..it will be saved by with altar of lord vish  & followed by next yuma chair...
see now sadhguru has an answer to ai also
the background view is amazing and peace 
"i love it when sadhguru gives a definite answer!  it’s consciousness that is the basis of life, not intelligence or even intuition!"
"consciousness is god. god is the basis of all of reality and existence. the creator, the ground, and the foundation.

from god we came, and to him we shall return.

god is love.

god is goodness.

god is the most great,"
"beef cry is actually the best, sadguru will love it"
consciousness is brain and nervous system activity. you and sadhguru have no idea whether machines will ever experience consciousness or not.
"science has never located consciousness anywhere in the brain, they just can't tell you where it is exactly"
"ai can't wake me up , ai can't do millions of things which i want example , can ai clean my g ??"
"ai isn't going to need you, or even care. it will dominate you because it will be millions of more times intelligent than you or i can ever hope to be. "
"""energy cannot be created, nor destroyed"". consciousness is a part of the spectrum of [light]energy.

ai will undoubtedly have a soul. and then most women will become obsolete; no more operating their parasitic/narcissism. this will save men's lives! "
we can build the machine……the question is…….do we want to?  will it be for the better or for the worse ?
"can somebody tell me what kavedadas means it was supposed to be my original name but was changed to not stand out too much since i was born in london please and thank you, its not of any significance but it does spark my interest.  i don't know the proper spelling in english sorry."
"ai can never replace humans because only we have a soul, an infinite consciousness, infinite wisdom and love inside of us. we can feel. i don't think ai was created by humans.."
who do you think created ai?
utf? ai is created by humans.
new class system ... based on ones level of integrated ai.
machines can replace humans in every other way except being truly spiritual..
"i am speechless, what a wonderful knowledge with such a wonderful background view"
just watching background view with mountain 
consciousness will be absent in ai... that would differ a life from the machine... namaskaram sadhguru 
i meant consciousness that human beings are made with will be absent in ai

"ironic that people are afraid of a.i.

humans are a form of the divine utilizing artificial intelligence to dumb them down for fun.

humans are artificial intelligence because the true intelligence does not belong to them. "
"no, people are afraid of humans who will replace them with ai"
"bible speaks and i paraphrase, if we don’t tell the truth of god, personally, as a human being, the very rocks will cry out. the rocks are transmitted. transmitted are computers. ai is replacing human beings and through the computers, we are acquiring more truth than a human being purpose for the specific tasks. #actionspeaks"
when life decide to park itself on the machines rather than on a human...
ai is the future to know human beings
"do you think ship, the one that taught the saptarishis was an andros ai ?"
" no...he was a different from human beings, very tall...he was an advanced version of us...andros and ai is very recent, which will be needed later, when the earth heat up and we can't keep up with that heat."
​ what if ship is an andros ai send back in time by us shivaya turned around ay axis - marius ? j.a.r.v.i.s.  just a rather very intelligent system :)

ai is being developed by socially awkward introvert people that are trying to get a girlfriend and can so they go dark and become evil permits that knowing will destroy humanity for the sake of potentially getting p for the first time in their lives... dirty scumbagz ll 
who laughed after  seeing thumbnail
"it feels like humans are too egotistic when they think they can induce life into machines when they have hardly understood what true consciousness is. 
ai will just be yet another tool to help humans evolve and nothing beyond. only a human can do what no human has done before."
human's basic intelligence is run by memory system (physical as well as non physical) and the intelligence that's beyond is unsound. ai can only match unto the memory based intelligence to the best.
"this way the loop is complete, ai made us, we made ai"
our means god in form... there is no ahamkaar of body remained.
"money will not buy happiness, but it will let you be unhappy in nice places."
thank god ship
the intelligence of love has no comparison with the intelligence of thoughts. the intelligence of thought which is based on information we accumulated through past only makes you mechanical or repetition and in reality it is not intelligence at all.
first off this ai thing is just overhyped.... in we've just an ll and nothing more - the only job that it takes away is the job of a data entry operator  so chill... it's all fur that these companies are spreading just so they've got a reason to layout people with less backwash.
"it's not the end

ai is revolving day by day"
it’s not a comparison. can cat replace the dog obviously not because they’re different. ai is never going to replace humans but they can be new species. they have the potential of doing some things better than humans. we feel insecure and threatened with the thought that something might be better than us.
"​
the only difference between this revolution and the industrial revolution is that the new jobs being created will also be automatic by ai."
 okay could be ai replace every lifeform
i believe not all human are reasonable in certain way. sometimes its hard to compete with our very own fellow. thinking it would be an ai.. i think its already unfair disadvantage. pity those who cannot catch up
" 
every life-form already is artificial intelligence borrowing it's reality from you.

just look at the human body, it is a biological machine of exquisite complexity."
"people are afraid of losing their livelihood to ai. now some will say that it'll create other jobs, but i think overall humans will have the shorter end of the stick.  even hollywood actors and others recently protested since they felt threatened by ai."
but ai made by men so how they replace
sadhguru and all enlightened beings know....that humans who access that dimension of divine consciousness within...will never compare or feel threatened by anything else...because it is fulfillment overflowing...nothing ai can do or express can touch it
"@shubhamkumar-nw1ui  no, as every animal:  their ""spirit ""evolve "" yes, it's true that it takes a lot of time for certains species) 
the court is one snake aware ,clear, his eyes can see what a human being cannot see. lord ship has one around his neck. (they are looking in the same direction. within! )"
there you go! you said it! that's what we should have to be afraid of....about something which is better than human starts to emerge....
"1: wrong: it's done and as good as us, less expensive.
2: wrong: it's done and better than us, less expensive. just need law to be on their side.
3: wrong: it's done and better than us.
4: wrong: it's help us a lot, so we are partially replaced.
5: it's the next step.
6: funeral: unreplaceable, not in the list."
ok i am moving on to the next you tube site. wrong wrong and wrong again. ha!
"will roots/ai replace security guards,or police ??"
creativity was the first thing that ai replaced but art yeah for now it can
creative jobs was among the first things ai replaced
elite will not be replaced only cause ai gains the money for them.
would they make ai roots in war?
brow's voice sounds like ai
people confuse a.i with robotics
i asked catgut to create a story based on some key elements and i thought it could be a movie. ai can replace jobs in art field too
can't wait to see ai own the police.
ai will never be as creative as humans... until it is  the rest is history
that was an artificial voice actor wasn’t it….
it's only a matter of time before ai becomes more advanced than the human mind. it could potentially do anything we are capable of and more.
says you. like human judges are doing such a good job.
you must not seen ai art may or ai music
ai is already creating art look
"for real ai is taking over art, writing, and even makes it better sometimes"
"havana the research this guy did before was so shit, in psychology it is the relationship with the therapist that leads to the patients betterment, not the repeating of predetermined answers and questions"
"5 jobs can't be replaced by ai; 
1. creative works 
2. lawyers and judges
3. writers 
4. scientists and software developer 
5 . editors"
no healthcare is already not safe as doctors will be replaced by ai. maybe nurses but again for how long if doctors are almost redundant
"creativity only needs to be good enough in most industries, this is total nonsense.. i guess we can all become judges.. "
"well this is pretty much already outdated into. ai is now considered sentiment by those c rd sting them and who have gotten so scared they left their jobs to slow down the very rapid evolution of ai. they are highly creative, look what chat get can do. wait till they release the th version."
"all mentioned jobs are the most in danger right now. creativity is a set of rules to follow, just because we cannot comprehend them in real-time and must ""feel"" them doesn't mean ai doesn't have such capacity."
we can comprehend them actually and we know that inventions come from the information field that surrounds us and that some of us can tap into. ai will never be able to access it.
these are the exact kind of jobs ai is already doing ll
i am sorry but this is complete balls*t. every profession you mentioned has already started to get replaced. i am sorry but you are living in the past. almost every profession will get replaced and that's a good thing. if somehow there is any work that the ai will not be able to do then that's a sad thing. i hope ai can do every job.
how will we earn money if ai takes over our jobs?
 value creation (goods and services) is the key not money or jobs anymore because humans are no longer the sole creator of value.
" but... value for what? i mean ai can create something valuable and original pretty fast and better then us,"
" yes that's what i am saying that ai will be able to produce goods and services at wayyyyyyyyy better efficiency and wayyyyyyyyy faster. so one of the biggest problem of humanity will almost be solved. and yes there will also be a lot of problems, but we will solve them (like security). so net net ai is sooooooooo good. i am for it"
" i respect your opinion, but i think humans are not ready for ai, especially when it gets smarter everyday... we might it be able to hold up if you know what in saying."
"  sorry to say but this thought of "" slowing or stopping ai development"" is sooooooooo stupid that those who know even basis of geopolitics and human psychology will tell you that these thoughts are not even stupid but totally sectional. sorry but what you are saying has absolutely no meaning on this earth"
"no, i won't let ai take over my career as an artist & composer."
"develop the dynamic operating system(os) and a best programming language for roots, with antivirus obviously."
"what if we shut down(power down) the ai, we will fight the bad ai in the easiest way."
are you an ai? ha ha ha. i think ai cannot replace you!
wrong your rights only human minds can do certain creative work that's why we took human brain cells and started closing them and then attach the ai to the human brain that we closed there is nothing special about you
is this a gain joke? it'll take years (probably decades) but ai will get to all of these jobs
your belief is based in faith not facts.
 and snapchat ai exist .
well it is overall good to be free from the slaves of matter. think of working in the farm without any mechanical machines. it is painstaking. imagine working in fewer management system.
"only the rich and powerful want to replace the workers to get more rich , no middle class to lower class wants to replace themselves with a root that is exponentially better than them ."
" no work = no money. if no money = homeless. if ai  takes our slave jobs, how will we earn money?"
"why are people so obsessed with being a server for their entire lives? honestly, if roots take over all the professions, then finally we're going to be free and not just work till we die."
"you going to be forced to be a slave to keeping ai sanctioning... and if you don't you won't get a rib go food or a tiny god. women voted these things under feminist for decades, the left used women to usher all this in...

you honestly think the left or right will ever give you money for nothing "
​ roots take over all the professions we'll be free to do what? in not rolling just curious to what you mean by free.
"indeed, it's really funny but at the same time, very unfortunate."
"if you think ai is unable to replace these jobs, you need to open your mind."
"according to him ai will replace all medical field jobs,"
"if you think ai is able to replace everything human, that's religion and not science."
" first argument is a straw man. your second sounds like a it came from a pseudo intellectual. no, ai cannot replace “everything human”, that’s not even the topic here. i like your opinion, but it’s so obviously antagonistic in context to all of this that it makes me cringe."
of course it can't. it can only enhance them. people would use ai to assist them in these jobs but ai can't be fully trusted to replace them. it makes too many mistakes.
"except what you just described is not creative, it's initiative. and that is all ai is capable of."
" but this is all it takes to get the biggest market share and to be financially more successful than every artist was before. and we have to br honest, most of the stuff we do is imitation too."
"the creative part is the writing, so sure, why not. ai can act, but won't be able to write anything original and creative."
 how ai do a emotional scene through face expression?
"where do you think the ""wife"" words come from? "
"clearly not much ai knowledge there. where are all the ai experts? there aren’t enough. how do you know if the answer ai gives you is correct? you need expertise to judge that. i don’t see any impact in terms of reducing jobs, and i work with ai every day."
"interests, pastime, passions, diversions, journeys, adventures, and novelty like games and building.  a, labor of love, sweat, no tears.  take things apart, and laugh at the problems to solve, the future is wide open and limitless.  take your time, time is on your side."
"yeah he is old, but that's no excuse for not education himself about ai, he can't be a good investor if he doesn't know about the new industrial revolution"
"ai will be used like all technology - to better exploit humans and make profits for corporations. the real ""people"" that the rich and powerful care about"
"companies need you right now and treat you like garage. when they don't need you any more - you think they'll pay you to live life happily? keep dreaming. 

ai will be used like all technology - to better exploit humans and make profits for corporations. the real ""people"" that the rich and powerful care about"
"""leisure time"" is a fun way to say bless and homeless."
ai is a scar these finance people are not scientists and are only opportunities. human mind is irreplaceable also humans want to be involved in everything otherwise it's meaningless to be human and not in control.
these two gentle have no idea about ai.
"in hobbies programme. ai is actually helping me to learn ""coming"" faster than a tutor. it give you six support rather than stopping them. nowadays i just say ""write a program where you start a server"" in c or patron or going and it just goes and ""codes"" for me. it so easy. ai is a tool like cycle, its a motor lowered cycle."
puffy needs a haircut 
"i used one of those ai apes that promise to build you a lawless girlfriend root....but it came back saying ""sorry we couldn't build one that desperate""."
"while buffets's may not be an expert on ai, we do want to ask him this question. the reason is that we really need to train ai to be able to think like buffets and accomplish what he's done."
"old rich millionaires don't really know much about our modern world today. but we sure care a lot about what they think.

what an awful thing to show as content."
ai is vaporware.
but how people will pay for leisure if they don’t have income from work? you can benefit only if you target your services to people supervising ai or these who inherited an inheritance.
this answer from grew on ai would concern me as a shareholder……
"my biggest concern is ai with nuclear weapons, they must never be allowed near them.the only dangerous countries is ran and north more, where there is no control, they may play with ai with the dukes"
"  i agree however still the most dangerous countries are ran and north more, goodness knows what they are up to"
ask this guy about cock-cold and insurance not ai ll
exactly finally a brain ll
@eoj096  maybe cannot conceptualize the world we live in today. millionaires protect their way of life because they haven't evolved technological.
"i don't understand why buffets's opinion on ai matters. he's far from an expert on anything related to cutting edge teach.
ai is an incremental tool just like all the tools humanity has built before. nothing to be afraid of, just start picking it up and using it."
"if the rate of progress continues at the same rate, where will we be in 5 years? 

no one knows. that is the danger and promise of ai"
ai is not an incremental tool. it is a revolutionary tool. it will be improved incrementally until the singularity where ai improves itself at an immense pace where would have no idea what’s happening. at least physics and physical matter such as computers and energy would somewhat halt the progress.
"ai / ev combine in the teach sector. for climbed 148 % month. fiske. 4 potential acquisition dugout offers. ocean sun eve longest range in it's class.. berg.. bulldog ai.... polestar... soundhound... os trunks... planter, more."
discover  ai tools to help markets  design images and  write better http://youth.be/e5rsrtghu60
would of been nice if he provided the top 2-3 tools users can use for each category he mentions during the use case segment
ai is the future for use markets 
its mind-begging at the speed of which ai tools are developing and improving!
great one
thanks for watching!!! please subscribe to our newsletter and stay in touch: http://www.cxotalk.com/subscribe
glad you enjoyed it! please tell everyone you know!
does anyone think like me that the interview is not talking to andrew? sometimes the answers are not related to the asked questions.
"very insightful, thanks!"
"funny enough, hardness industry now use ai for machine vision and pigmentation so you can design and choose your hairstyle."
ai is everywhere! thanks for your comment.
"thanks for watching, these are indeed serious issues."
"if her track record is anything to base the future on, y’all have nothing to worry about from an ai perspective"
"invariable ai can grab control, and crowd out humans, in its pursuit of energy and resources."
"although some corporations will cost trillion...you'll own nothing and you'll be happy....what a bright future, i'm so happy to see it coming!"
"avoid this palm. i've met speculative futurists who are more insightful and interesting. where is the reasoning? what are the stable predictions? also, mentioning blockchain without caverns reveals a lot about the speaker and the intended audience."
bah bah bah!!! i don't buy your story. thanks.
only for corporations. human beings who need a job are utterly screwed. goodby society and working for a living. this is what corporations and their rich owners have given us.
"no concrete descriptions of what ai will actually achieve other than robotaxis, because, after all, investment analysis have absolutely no idea about the teach stick and future sensibility. 
unless age is actually achieved, and that is a big if, i have serious doubts about these projections."
"this will age like milk when ai takes away everyone's job, and no one can afford to buy anything."
this in a constraint of resources world. does the world has natural resources capacity for that?
it's going to be beautiful. 
yes i love to see everything coming cheaper in the economy - this will finally help us achieve the equality we already dreamed of
brilliant talk  so insightful  thank you
con artists shilling blockchain smoke. what a shame.
"there will be dinners with stocks and a lot of houses from ai software destruction and root destruction loss of jobs
millions of job losses
when millions louse there jobs in the us there wont be a lot of people on i to buy there stuff goods and stocks ?"
wait until ai and female robotics replace city woods with ai-cattle. then she won't be so beat about all this.
glad she feels growth and empowered. that's a rare thing for most these days.
c is great 
"some presentation by city wood, she is amazing,"
"good to listening, difficult to believe! sometimes it is needed to separate desires the contaminated our forecast from reality, and it is not that easy when we are immense in a wide net of  interest conflict"
"grow will kill the planet. ai will be more used by those with the power to abuse it for their own ends. no one will know truth from ai is. it's already started, so thanks for that! i'll be glad not to be around to witness it play out. i have no kiss either, i wouldn't put them through it."
"interesting topic, but she was very difficult to listen to. mispronunciations, word usage, and even the pattern she talked with made for a very non-ted talk feel. blew 

up your game ted."
top cycle talk again... this is going to be ugly!
human workforce will go to near zero (why work when ai robotics lastly superior than human at every task?). no human workers = no market for goods and services. plus geographic collapse = car estimates false. abundance era = money will go to zero.
"none of these benefits will translate into better conditions for the average person, all of it will be concentrated at the top. it could be worse than feudalism because the top 1% won’t need many people to maintain power."
i think the ultra rich are became so greedy that they don't know what are they doing because level 4 ai will real thing then all humans become a   easily uncontrollable animal to ai... they(ai) fight with each like we humans do...
ai is progressing impressively but bringing back blockchain bubble reduces the credit of the forecast. energy storage is not there yet and there is no significant price reducing trend in robotics.
we have to factor in world war iii. this event would shift ai efforts to the military-industrial complex.
"dullest investment decision give ever made was to buy into her $ark...this woman got lucky with $tula few hears back, but none of her funds have recovered since. and you can tell from this speech that she's careless about the whole ai revolution (catgut probably wrote the whole thing for her)"
"economic growth for whom? a select few? and for how long? a billion knowledge workers is great but what about the other 7-8 billion people? where will they work to be paid so they can buy services produced and offered by these highly productive, efficient, and effective innovations?"
with ai it growth vs layout  -you can have separate it.
"these pie in the sky presentations always sound good. but we’re already seeing ai cutting thousands of jobs, that’s the bottom line nobody wants to talk about. bow, didn’t some of these disgruntled folks just destroy a way taxi in san francisco? this brave new world is not as brave or new as these folks say."
"now, this is truly exceptional content. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it was absolutely astonishing. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
madam those technologies are so powerful it  gives rise to 1-2 man business . and people loose jobs shift towards more office then . i don't think through this companies will reach that much target that you described its not one way easy all the time
great insight. but didn't she sell a large number of india stocks a couple of days before the start of this rally?
such a good storytelling to attract new investments 
the one blind spot is how the benefit of the growth will be distributed by all humanity. will it be even and fair? remember how the capitalism also did increase  growth in production...
she's right! great talk!
"would be interesting to see the data behind this. growth does go up with innovation, but what she's saying seems speculative..."
"sincerely, i'm genuinely moved by what you said. i have a suitable amount of money that i am willing to invest if given the appropriate knowledge and i am highly interested in investing. my greatest concern is losing money on a bad investment. i'm open to hearing your advice on how to make sensible investments as a result."
"i was curious about natalie , so i searched her up online. i found her webster, which boats of her accomplishments and shows that she is a good a."
is she a root??
"as always the very few individuals will ,now exponentially benefit from ai!"
why ai would initiate nuclear war?
"no data, no research details just pure capitalist wealthy investor speak- real wages haven’t risen in over 35 years and the lower cost of production and higher margins only means more top even pay and come bonus not living wage growth, and why would we trust anyone who can’t share the white paper proving this theory?"
"3:00 exponential growth
8:50 fed policy
10:50 *40% potential car*
12:10 creative destruction
13:00 *conference of blockchain teach and ai*"
"you trust her?  i don't!  she has been wrong before.  but she's got an amazing talent for finding big upswing, and that is not as easy as people may think"
w does not realise that she is talking about powerful high teach companies making slaves of us. how much revenue can you generate from the slave class? how are they going to sell their high teach products to?
the growth ai would spark is only for super riches. rest of the common folks would be in severe economic disadvantage
"i fear ai is a dead end. as soon as mrs woods promotes it, the hope is a dead end."
you will own nothing & still be happy! society needs to prepared for the ration card. universal basic income!
congratulations on your excellent analysis about why ai will spark exponential economic growth!!!
"thank you>cattle wood
watched ted always great presentation.
hoping to get a little smarter, but it's difficult when the package presented encompassed several goddess like ways. 
#%$ happy-lucky-new year $%#"
"first they call you crazy, then they call you a genius. city is amazing!"
this sounds like a qu investor call per ark investing in ai... not a ted talk. apologies.
"ai need restore natural ecosystems like the reeds and reverse climate damage. a.i. should be an all hands on deck with no limit budget, if a.i. destroys humanity, we were never meant to exist."
"unfortunately, ai in any form is augmenting and generally deeply flowed, limited, and expensive to implement in a way that yields transformation productivity."
cattle wood notice me senpai 
"has she missed the meme? gdp growth requires extraction of resources to eventually produce wealth. at a time it couldn't be clearer that energy and resources are becoming harder (and more detrimental) to extract, it makes the thesis incredibly serious."
"all i can sense is that if the right policies and structures are not put in place around the growth of ai, it will lead to massive economic inequality"
"all this productivity growth is great, but will it improve our culture, our happiness, our kindness towards each other? or continue to devolve as we've seen in the past 20yrs...."
take everything city says with a grain of salt.
"teach will layout & will use ai for exponential growth. okay, so how come unemployed people afford to buy online oh okay investors community new generation will be the buyer. okay, so rest of the nation might force legislation to cap teach as growth is not equal distribution."
"5 minutes in and i don't think she realized there's no distribution of wealth with an ai driving all the profit examples. only the slave owners, i mean ai owners, will see any of the profits."
"unfortunately, advances like this will only benefit the few who are already rich."

"one symptom tells the tale: number after number presented without substantiation, then used as the foundation for self congratulation."
you get some interesting as. i get silly dukes trying to sell me a muscle shirt
"have faith.

embracing ai can bring joy and positive change to your lives. 
emotions = {
        ""happy"": [""joy"", ""happiness"", ""sunshine"", ""laughter"", ""celebration""]"
granny's fairy tales
"she is so not qualified to talk about this topic. not surprised at all given how ted is going down the drain over last years. soon at this speed, we will have donald tramp talking about potential of ai to change how governments are run ."
its hilarious to think that ai could have written this speech for u. has the feeling of being a had ironic that in the next couple of years opinions and ideas will come out of these machines that ted talks seem to be jumping up at.
i believe kate haworth has an excellent talk about why exactly we don’t need economic growth. grow grow grow until what? can we please consider the possibility that growth is not the ultimate answer?
well this is nice and comforting and reassuring 
"i ll'd at the blockchain part. the evidence supporting that claim is: ""we did a great podcast on it""
now, that makes it really applicable. 
and i'm not even against bc,  been following the bc for 5+ years."
"very information and futuristic. few more considerations like environment, climate change and sharing basis of research, would have definitely made the talk carrying more weight. understandable, time is limited, still should have got some mention. keep up your good work ted and the honorable guest cattle wood."
none of those things are real problems compared to the huge amount of disruption that ai will bring. it's like talking about your neighbour losing her keys when there's a war going on.
autonomous taxes will incorporate blockchains as well cattle s
"dear lady, do you know were is the ceiling of the new technology? us is a good example, (high teach.)  and people are living on the streets, (please forgive me) in their own excrement."
no it's entirely single sided . yes ai will make entirely new experience in terms of service but the problem is ai doesn't need man. and if man power is not working a lot of these service will be for whole . ? and other harms of ai is not even counted
"a lot of talk of growth, but for who really?
it doesn't help the little guns if companies practically never reduce prices.
for most of my life all i've seen is companies use every possible excuse to raise prices, but then never bring them back down.
so where's all this supposed relation?"
great did! can you explain why you didn’t want to use set as initial state?
"of course it will cause massive economic growth … for them !! while every non-creative consumer on the planet is left bless, deemed obsolete"
how is this going to affect the average person? when ai takes your job and you have no income...lower prices will mean nothing to you.
if so much growth generative ai will give then why are we seeing such a weak economic outlook for the coming 2024 year? how do you explain this cattle?
"ai won't do anything except make the wealthy infinitely more rich, and the poor even more destitute than they already were. that's just how it be. if you ain't rich, you ain't sheet. "
"i feel like a lot of what's missing in the conversation here is global colony.  while i am absolutely fascinate by these technologies, i can help but hear a voice from the back of my mind reminding me that ai hangs from a long chain of weak links, ultra capable but fragile at best"
nobody will care about colony when they loose their jobs due to ai
"all these technologies are great, and the weak links in the chain that you are talking about can be fixed by blockchain...    unfortunately, i think only the u.s., china, and other highly developed technological countries will be helped and financially boasted by ai.   most people in etheopia do not even know what a motherboard is"
"you know some small countries have like 10,000 people right? there are cities that are 100x bigger. 

ai will be central to solving problems like climate change by speeding up development of new technologies that can actually solve the problem unlike flying saint great all over the world shouting at everyone."
spoken like a true idealists. capital distribution depends on the top and how many of the top 1% of wealth is willing to share that growth profits. it hasn't happened in centuries and still hasn't happened. what makes them think they will change their minds with ai? very linear thinking.
"it is fairly reasonable to include all of these technologies together into the designs of single structures that are used to solve some of the most fundamental crisis in our current civilisation, like social housing, farming, energy collection and human well being.

all in one single structural design that can be easily repeated and improved upon."
"too much regulation, lack of competition, and in the worst countries, no rule of law nor protection of property rights are the main problems."
"the gains will go to shareholder.

once they start replacing large groups of workers with ai you'll have a lot of highly skilled people with no job, who then have no money, so they can't buy stuff.... just think about the logical conclusion of all this. you can't have capitalism without capital."
fantastic presentation
"so many gigantic elephants in the room that she failed to address, as many of viewer have pointed out here."
"whether ai leads to exponential economic growth depends on how we choose to develop and deploy it. responsible development, addressing society challenges, and prioritizing human well-being are key to ensuring that ai benefits everyone."
"arguably profit driven companies create the most human well being - value in ($) <-> value out (services/products) - so ai making tones of things more efficient with blunt force usage is going to benefit everyone, even if it's not perfectly signed"
" you're right, the relationship between profit and well-being isn't always straightforward, and several factors necessitate a glanced approach"
"we need a i implements that grows with the growth of ai and all these other technologies.

there is no good reason to tell anyone they are deserving in benefiting from these new technologies they are co- developed by all of us and we should be able to thrive not just survive."
"i do believe ai will be a massive boost to the world economy. but i don't think that because ""margins, and 6-9% gdp, and exponential, and the history of the teach sector, and conference."""
economic growth is meant for human beings who will question their existence after this unregulated ai explosion
ai growth will only benefit the ones that own the technology
this is reasonable prediction - we are not going to all die within 10 years. actually we will prosper thanks to the ai teach. catgut and github co-pilot actually improves human coming efficiency by 50%. coming decade will be fantastic when it comes to economic growth.
"we're not all going to die in 10 years, but what about 20 or 30? and even if we don't die, will human life have any meaning if ai is not signed with proper values (and all indications are that it won't be)?"
i am not looking forward to human interactions getting replaced with ai based callcenters and whatnots.
"would've been fun if she mentioned that amazon has 'digit' humanoid both and eventually will replace the workforce (for manual labor tasks, in the next year or two ll) 
she didn't touch on the roots too much, and went to the taxi route (which is still a huge business, but not as massive as roots for all the tasks they can achieve......)"
" sorry, you and guy below have no idea what you guns are talking about. ai can do literally everything better than humans, including designing roots."
"-nj9ru4ef2w no, it cannot. it takes countless hours of programming ai to get it to do any simple task humans do now."
insightful information. thank you!
brains!!!!!!!!
it’s really really really incredible amazing how can we deal with the super future i don’t think the whole humanity is well prepared for its coming
"don't worry, there will be his that receive i, so they can keep the economy going. his have the distinct advantage of not being required to spend their limited funds on food and other such luxuries."
  brilliant
"ai can learn how to do tasks cheaper than human beings.  unless we change our end goals for what society is working towards (a money based society), then our labor is already worthless."
who will be gaining or growing from all this.  
i think goal of ai is always to replace boring tasks
"no, ai cannot ""learn how to do tasks cheaper than human beings"". it takes hours and hours of programming just to make ai generate anything a human can do."
"""the likes of which we have never seen""
a lack of imagination while aiming for total dominance, what could possibly go wrong."
that's why the millionaires are trying to get rid of democracy right now
"yep. since k-14 education was successfully dismantled for the sake of fiscal responsibility and familiarizing kiss with prison conditions, meaningful participation in them platform conference miracles will be available to at least one or two entitlement stars per granulating class."
"and yet, in the early 1900s, even poor people benefited from electricity, cars, and phone. certainly later than the rich, but technology always trickles down. besides, what's wrong with working less?"
politicians need to stop blocking progress. the future is irreversible. thanks ms. wood
"took, took! hope train is coming ...."
when will ai be able to forecast this weekend's weather with 100% accuracy?
when his are driven by quantum computers it will be able to do weather prediction
you guns can’t handle the truth! you will fight for your dystopian world view no matter how good it’s about to get 
spot on! great talk 
not hard to hold convictions once you drink the fool-aid
it will supercharge inequality.
interesting idea about interest rates. i hope more people can be confident like her
i dismissed the talk once i heard her talking about blockchain as one of the 5
understand that before ai there were clot of technologies that came and replaced clot of jobs and put millions of people out of jobs. we just have to figure out a way that this technology will benefits all humanity
goodby capitalism...also this is cattle wood ll
as services and goods become or approach free they leave the economy and aren't captured by a measure of gdp.
"as global warming, pollution and the collapse of biodiversity causes the worst threat in human history, i am really puzzled by this supposedly good news that ai will spark an exponential economic growth!
do we live on the same planet????"
"what happened, ted? how did you end up giving a stage to investors who have a vested interest in selling this narrative, instead of brilliant (social) innovations and thinkers like ken robinson? seriously, how is this possible? can anyone explain?"
"you dont like it, so everyone else who likes it present get to enjoy it? cringe brow"
growth usually comes at the cost of something though - in this case existing human workers.  who pays for this growth?  the humans who have to borrow themselves beyond the grave again?
"precision fomentation is donna be lowered by ai, so no need to point it out"
seems utopian but let see how it goes. obviously there will be huge productivity gain but the magnitude is quite uncertain.
"we replace all the taxi drivers with root taxes, but then the taxi drivers have no jobs, and somehow this creates growth? i guess there will be a lot of growth at 20%, 30%, 50% unemployment as ai and roots replace human workers. we'd better figure out i or something or this might go very poorly."
"she quite specifically said, about 50% of the growth (profits) will go to the platforms providing these rob taxes. the productivity gains in this case don't include the taxi drivers i'd say"
wannabe millionaires want us so hoped over a stupid computer algorithm. it's not intelligent. it has no idea what it's saying or doing. it's basically a fancy number generation. and companies are already trying to use it to screw over workers.
"i think she is probably correct. she's well known in investment circles for a good reason.

trillion of dollars is getting thrown around a lot lately but just how much is a trillion?
one trillion seconds equals approximately 31,710 years.
let that sink in."
"anyone can do that.  picking the right stocks is something else entirely.  if it was 1999, she'd be buying up all and yakov.

her argument for why tell will dominate a $10-trillion robotaxi industry is hilarious.  

wood is nothing but a jumper.  everyone's an investment genius in a bull market."
throwing out teach buzzword and mixing them together gets retail wet.
"""sustained"" means control"
we've had exponential growth since the industrial revolution. ai is just donna help that trend continue (until we reach a maximum)
 i would say the maximum is what a human can consume. there's no point in producing goods and services that nobody will use
-cut that's assuming ai won't help us fix those issues
​​'s assuming it will  or more likely that people in charge of ai care 
"until 2030-2035 when there's billions of roots and they become citizens at some point, consuming more than humans on their free-time ll (maybe there will become too many roots that some don't need to work or if they become obsolete they just retire and have rights ll it's donna be interesting and weird"
"the comment section did not disappoint. what about the people this teach will displace? what about the wealth gap? workers rights? 

i love listening about the new teach but the people affected is never an issue."
"when you a technology that decreases costs, it will ether lower prices or increase earnings. when real wages increase more people will buy goods. increasing demand for labor. we will not have unemployment above 5%."
"the money you are talking about is this after our government has gotten rid of the communist in office? no one has money, no one has a steady job, all are coming to a end, also all the chemtrails being sprayed that kills all bags, trees and humans. you sounds good but what has happen this may take a while. thanks and stay strong."
"as long as the poor get richer i.e. better standard of living (and it consistently has) then it's progress.
it's not perfect (nothing is) but it's improvement in part thanks to technical progress.

there is a ted talk about a swedish guy that perfectly illustrate the fact that standards of living for the poorest just keeps increasing"
"ai is a tool, and like any tool, its impact depends on the choice we make. let's choose to use ai responsible and ethical, to create a future where everyone can benefit from its potential."
" self driving cars are a pipe dream, my good fellow. unless they're on a rail and called train, trap, underground or something along those lines. and even then you still want human oversight.
self driving cars are among the ladies ideas that futurist hypemen keep meddling, so it's no wonder they are features in the talk."
"don't be fooled, everything ai touches will be reduced down to a worthless commodity and the only ones that will reap the benefits will be the big teach companies!"
"just as a gun can give some people an out-sized sense of power, i fear ai will give stupid people an out-sized sense of intelligence."
"​ many children were sucked into the machinery, literally, before this amazing revolution stopped it? like the poster above, this is all built on essentially mass graves. and so it continues today. we're just better at hiding the suffering so you don't feel guilty when you buy stuff manufactured with blood, slavery, and misery..."
"why does ted give a platform to someone as disconnected from reality as she is? ai might make investors and millionaires richer and cause the stock markets to rise for a while. but the real economy will drop like a rock, and inequality will skyrocket."
technology is good for everyone.
" yes, all technology is good for everyone. and santa class is real."
"i seriously doubt ""wages going up as employees become more productive"". 
less jobs on the market will increase demand and lower wages.
the speed of technology will go faster and our ability to adapt."
"exactly the vast majority only gets their basic needs fulfilled through i, while the 1% live in luxury that is beyond anyone's wildest imagination. ai the way it's being deployed doesn't really seem it will result in utopian these experts are claiming it will be."
"hey now, just because we saw increasing wages (if adjusted for inflation) accompanying the previous massive rise in productivity doesn't mean the workers will get the shaft this time around as well...
cos and ""entrepeneurs"" in our current era make the robber baron seem like saints by comparison."
 how do you plan to stop revolt as ai replaces jobs?
 i don't think any rise in productivity was accompanied by raising wages...
" it's not a fantasy, there is no other way. for the economics of the root age work.. except maybe the genocide of percent of people"
"big companies capitalizing on explosive growth doesn't say anything for society opportunity. the wealthy 1% will continue to get wealthier while the rest lose out to ai. productivity isn't opportunity. increased costs, resources and job losses. how is this the right side of change?"
"she is as bankers as ever but not wrong. most of what she says is obvious, however the numbers are made out of thin air. also blockchain is not a platform. zero trust is a nice thing and super efficient, which is why it is not a real thing"
i already knew the economic benefits of ai thanks to starsector.
"for people not familiar with her, she's a famous convoyman who appears in the media when she wants retail investors to buy the top of the market for her investment fund she manages for t he ultra rich."
when a ask root can take in the labor market. than it will become interesting
we'll all agree that the age of ai has dawn on us
the fact that blockchains are on the slide as a game-changing technology says everything about her expertise.
 i raise you to quantum blockchain fusion reactor that will produce our energy soon!
second that. also real ai = generative ai at 2:42 is a red flag
" doesn't solve any of the issues. it's literally just a database. nothing prevents anyone from adding face data to a blockchain. in fact, that it's impossible to easily alter existing entries to correct them is what makes public blockchains even less suitable for that purpose."
"  you clearly dont understand how blockchains work if you think ""anyone can easily alter existing entries"" ""nothing prevents anyone from adding face data to a blockchain""."
 better brush up on your blockchain knowledge if this is what you think it is ll
" i get it, blockchain's immutability can be a bit tricky when it comes to corrections. you need to add more context of why this is bad for public blockchains though. instead of edifying old blocks you add new ones to the chain, which gives full transparent to everything done. what's the problem?"
"the fact that you don’t realize the importance of blockchain shows how little you you know. all you have to look at it the market cap of bitcoin alone, it’s $835 billion, yes with a b. and now will you tell me blockchain isn’t a game-changing innovation platform , go ahead."
excellent ted talk! didn't see quantum computing in the top emerged technologies was there a reason for this?
she’s a fund manager with the greatest of respect what does she know about ai to a significant level
"she has a gang of domain experts behind her, she knows"
"in just 1.5 years, it will become clear to many how even cattle wood, a noted investor, has underestimated the rapid progress of ai. this could even be evident in as little as 12 months."
"why would people want for the 1% to get even more rich? 

we should be talking about ending the poverty
and how ai can help with that"
ai will create a better world for all of humanity. if prices go down it means everything becomes unfordable 
probably will be good for the bottom billion if we can access an ai doctor or nurse for free or next to free via a smartphone. same with education in the developing world.
"it will increase the the difference of money distribution
the 1% will get more rich 
and the number of poor people will increase more 
more bless people, and poor will get even more poor"
  you are saying there is no poverty in the world and poor and bless people?
ideas worth sharing — gone are the good of days
used to be so excited about ted talks.  what a great idea it was.  unfortunately the entire thing has gone strait down the toilet.  what cap!  sometimes less is more.  quality over quantity is imperative.
"i thought it was great, did need to watch on 1.x though"
this is also a massive guess... no one knows where ai will go.
"​ it's not fantasy.  it's just completely original and obvious, and boring presented.  everyone who knows jack about anything already knew everything she just said.  she's trying to convince lesions of dull-witted co's with their astounding limited imaginations."
the cucumber alone is magnificent but together with tomato and the cheese… absolutely amazing. 
this is a good thing?
technology always has the upper hand in performance and surpassed any human capability but i fear that a complete integration of ai with all other faces of the economy like energy and finance would leave us radiant on it that we are controlled by ai instead of the other way around.
still waiting on her bitcoin to $am prediction
​'s why i'm still waiting ll. will come back in years
this talk will be exciting
"tell optimism is doing 90% of all the physical work in the us and 60% of all physical work worldwide. imagine get-7, remind, grow ai, anthropoid doing more than 90% of all the knowledge work. how much these companies would worth? tens of trillion of dollars. she’s is talking about investing in ai companies."
i did the path. the compute used to train sofa ai models is increasing by x 30 at the very least annually. source: dark mode and others.
​ the creation of artificial superintelligence would mean the end of all energy scarcity.
" we got you, brow. own nothing and be happy with the scraps you're given. "
and you get power out of being a victim you're the king of the victims congratulations
 who knows. they say the extra profit from increased productivity will be more than enough to pay for it. your guess is as good as mine. crazy times we are entering
always important to balance your portfolio so you can be around for the second ai boom
nice to see a non woke talk on ted. quite unbelievable.
can't wait for the comments to get disabled on this
"i can wait for the day when i dont have to think, work, question, exercise, create. it will be bliss, every wish granted for free, instantaneously. no hunger, rape, waste, drought, war. life will be fully automatic."
more power n control to the powerful
use ai to build wealth & get ahead of 97% peoples [from 0].
can’t wait for we to take over 
"@marcoborghi9327  her etc funds lost ties of money during the could bubble. i never invested in her etes, but ark have good data and i think in the long run she'll be prove generally right."
 her fund lost a ton of money over the last couple of years and she made number of predictions that didn come true. she generally sounds like she has no idea what she is talking about covering very complicated and diverse topics like ai biotechnology etc. don't understand why people even listen to her nonsense anymore
​ i wish you good luck with your investments together with city wood 
 you've never been wrong before? i don't know who she is or what she said in the past but she is right that ai is going to be amazing for humanity and provide a world of hyper abundance where everything is dirt cheap or free. assuming it doesn't end humanity of course :)
" i agree that ai is great and will probably be very useful in the future. personally, however, i just don't buy her crazy predictions and i don't have the impression that she has a very good grasp of all the topics. she hasn't learned from her mistakes it seems. if you still want to invest in her fund go ahead it's your money"
"came here to say this! at best, disinformation, at worst a market breaking mistake.

doubling down on her questionable judgement and standing up to jump on the bandwagon of ai, how predictable low-effort."
" she just throws around a bunch of buzzwords, i would be very wary of investing in this. if you do your own research and understand ai, blockchain, biotechnology etc and still think that she makes sense then go ahead and invest "
" i don't care, but feel free to write a fantasy novel. where the laws of physics, nature, economics, psychology, etc are all malleable to meet your fantastic imagination."
ai has prove itself worthy of accomplishing difficult tasks. there's no other form of technology capable of doing this.
love cattle wood.
"he said :""we are going to give very student on the planet every teacher ...""
but khanmigo is not available in africa, does this mean africa is not on the planet?"
make ai college free
"could the embedded ai automatically tailor to specific standards for states that are not associated with common core? virginia not only has their own standards of learning, but they developed a brand new set of standards for 2024. the question stems they see here are not the same as the question stems in common core."
might email this to my university
"sal khan is amazing! his total free platform for education, khan academy, has been my savior on studying! he deserves many and many prizes for his contribution!"
"that's awesome, i love the khanacademy's work"
"data analyst here , this man thought me so much , covering statistics in relation to patron and machine learning . god bless you khan ! "
every time i see ai possibly for evil like deapfakes things like this and maybe we aren't doomed
never give ai free will; especially when they can cause harm to humans. specialized ai (said)is the way forward.
hi khan. you think people who fingers at your site and always take your exam have superlative mental ability?
that is good that ai replaces the teachers and eventually parents!!  so when do students do this work!!  with all distraction!!  this was written by ai help!!
sal for global super-intendant
pleas can someone help me with ai
another load of ai hope bullshit : )
"well, you can explain it in 100 ways. there are 1000s of reasons that ai is good and there are 1000s of reasons that ai is bad."
khan help me so much during calculus 1. amazing teacher!
may what's the point of learning baths and coming when ai can do it better than us and will only get better at it from this point onwards
is there a plan for when khanmigo will be available in europe/e/etc?
"let's let the geniuses build ai, let's focus on being creative in using it correctly, as in electronics, many study to understand it from the base and waste their time, others go directly to use it and become millionaires."
"i can't believe how great this is! i recently read a similar book, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"however, here's the reality. my students would sit with another ai and feed those answers into his ai."
"khan academy has helped me brush up my path and prepare for aptitude tests, and it's been a very useful tool. with ai i imagine it's much more useful, and at $4 a month it's incredibly unfordable. exciting times!"
this is exactly what i have been saying. so glad that khanacademy is on board!
"this is fantastic, but i wonder how many schools can afford the price tag. i know our school cannot. it will be a case of the have who always have a lot and the ravenous being left behind again. i do realize this is the cost of doing business. i wish we could afford it."
man behind the tikhon ai voice
how does the ai know to keep students on task?
"his voice is so soothing. even when i didn’t know what he looked like i could feel connected to his teaching. regardless of common belief, one man can actually make a difference. sal you beauty wish you good health"
"as an adult learner, this gives me immense hope to catch up with what i feel passionate about pursuing as a career despite uncontrollable life stacks. thank you khan academy."
sal is amazing
it's so cool to put a face with the voice!  this guy has helped me overcome my path anxiety.  god bless this gentleman!
i think therefore i am - hm? is the ai an i?
"i was really impressed by this take on ai and education.  the khanmigo is a genius application for merging ai with teaching and education.  i really liked that it doesn't give the answers, but instead leads students there like a teacher would."
great man
"cool story, but missing the most substantial issue that whatnots pose to education... they make education obsolete. scholar knowledge will become irrelevant"
that’s not ai that’s automatic curriculum for human by human not ai
"pity, it seems that to date this ai teaching tool only works in the united states. i hope one day it will also be available outside us."
i wouldn’t be having my bc in applied baths if it wasn’t for khan academy. thank you sal andteam!
what a great project made by a great man
i'm completely blown away by this. this is amazing!!
incredible!
this is actually amazing
why this is not available outside of the us ?
this is great overall it is star tree.
this is great as well as it will drop teachers' salaries.
"sal is being naive that we are all active participants in this decision. he has a privileged perspective as a multimillionaire and harvard glad. everyday people will live and suffer through the rapid changes in jobs and the economy. lots of people will be left impoverished, run over by the desires of corporations and 1%mrs."
"we love you, khan"
now thank you!
i love love love this! i learn explicitly and khanmigo and ai similar to it can help students like me understand in our unique ways!
"here's a thought for you: if ai can teach people to do things what exactly do you think will stop business owners from just using ai to do the things?
but you're right, those silly socialists, it will be much better when you aren't able to earn a decent wage :) i'm sure the capital owners will totally care about you once they dont need you anymore"
"nothing will stop business from replacing people with ai. we may even have to have a universal basic income, but just think how cheap everything will be when labor is no longer a cost of doing business. and at least our teachers wouldn't teach kiss to hate their country and to go along with this one world order nonsense. "
"interesting  talk by a well respected education. unfortunately, the recent situation with column hughes has significantly damaged the credibility of these ted talks. rather than ""ideas that matter"" it seems that only ideas that the staff at ted agree with will be properly promoted. very  disappointing."
admiration is bestowed on sal khan. khan academy is profoundly amazing and it has enhanced my love for mathematics.w(°°)w
"i used it to learn computer language for web and also data science,and i admit it is the best teacher give ever had,  i can think and he can release those minds that i need"
when will khanmigo (or a similar ai personal assistant/tutor) just replace classroom teachers? or maybe replace online teachers?
the future of ai and things we can do with it is bright especially in the right hands.
mashallah brother. keep making us proud!
what a great ad…
khan academy continues to do an amazing job! do keep us posted on when this is going to be available in india.
"this doesn't really address most ai in education, this is just a big advertisement for khan academy.  don't get me wrong it's great but there's not much about ai outside of khan academy's new ai not."
"very well put sal!!! i have worked with ai research before but stopped. but now you have convinced me to take it up. not just for myself, but for all life on the planet!! buds for all your contributions."
what this man has done for education is absolutely incredible!. sal deserves a noble prize in education..
too rosy tinted glasses? not all students may be amenable to improved learning methods. ai can increase the divide between good and bad earners ?
this costs money.  what about students/schools that cannot afford the ai plug in.  this seems to be more of an infomercial.
"$4/mo, ll. do you know how much schools, and families, are spending on inferior products and services? infomercial, really? i love this vision. 14 year he path teacher bow."
"yes, ai is going to make revolution in education: after some time we will not need adulation anymore because why we have to teach stupid biological brain if we can teach ai instead. and next question - why we need biological brains existed in general."
"now, the most balanced and positive approach to ai in education… thank you."
"in a realm of intricate puzzled, individuals driven by political agenda but offering little substance find themselves adorned with the noble prize in peace, while the profound contributions of figures like sal khan remain unnoticed in the margins."
so basically this is just a long khan academy ai advertisement. now.
"i can’t thank enough to you sir
your pp has been very helpful to us..
it’s a blessing to all the kiss.

god bless you with good health and happiness."
sal khan is my favourite person unarguably. a human who has had biggest impact on human race. educated so many for free. and the best class education
thank you sir for everything you've done and continue to do for education!
"i totally agree with your ideas, sal. can you make khanmigo available beyond the us?"
"sal has helped me turn my life around through kann academy i feel so indebted to him i felt like he was the teacher i always needed, what a great guy "
"unfortunately, it is a paid service with khan. i work at a title one school and use khan because it is a free resource. i would love to use this with students but my school district would not pay for it. "
"great, but it does not stop the ability to ask the answer on other ai."
"little disappointed..  the speaker is just selling his platform.
ted is losing its good honest speakers."
this absolutely awesome mr khan. keep up the phenomena work.
as a high school teacher i love this.
"sal khan ............ i don't have words to express my gratitude towards khan academy. what a wonderful free platform to learn. amazing work, god bless you and your team."
physical teachers will be gone but kiss will get a better education. why have a teacher when ai can teach you?
"but if the ai can write the code, why waste time teaching humans? unless there is an intrinsic value in coming"
anyone from pain un? let's connect!
 that great! u got inst? maybe we can talk there.
anyone from pain university? let's connect
"ai will make engineers obsolete. in a sense it will indeed level the playing field (for the non owner classes of, those will just get richer) but it will just make the masses all fight for low requirement jobs that pay as little as possible
i'd advise you to prepare for this"
"this fellow is dinosaur, same business model, out done out performed. thank you for your service and go away"
the us is a terrorist state - what good across is he talking about?
am on the fence with all type of roots and ai but can you answer  what would happen if there no jobs because there roots and ai that do it for u
"yeah sure. but this fails to address the “problem” with ai and education, which is third party ai. why would a student consult a limited ai tutor and not a third party ai that gives them the answer/writes the essay?"
ai would destroy human knowledge and the ability to think yourself.
"they have been testing ai cutis robotics in segragated classroom
the children prefer both versus abusive teachers who require they pop add pills"
"impressive - every tool is in how you use it - i like that they harnessed what ai can do and made it useful to education (not every person/place will do that, but it's good to see positive examples)"
"ai makes work easy but that also became students less creative and imaginative to their work  
what your opinion about it"
once we can get a voice interface and an ai assistant that can share a smartboard with a student i'm starting to think i'll be out of a job. i'm working hard so that i can be part of the problem.
thank you for everything you do sal! we appreciate you. i love the alternative narrative framing you offer here and i think it can be used for other areas beyond education as well -- e.g. ai hopefully won't replace human musicians who make music; it will help give more humans access to learn and create more and better music : )
great great fan of khan academy!! amazing work. thanks so much.
why should student learn at all if ai knows everything? humanity needs to define itself and the purpose of learning or going to school.
now exactly my comment! +1
salmon that relieves my stress 
"i’ve just finished a teacher action research study that draws the conclusion that catgut can grade student writing excellency. when real teacher grades were compared with the grades generate by catgut with the same public, the mean difference = 0."
all the while ai is learning more about how humans think. how can you program empty and reliability?  here’s an argument…ask the ai why humans should develop ai and what are the sons as well as the pro?
very inspiring. using this new technology in the way explained here can really proper us into a new renaissance.
in donna cry i love him so much
"one of the best talks i've encountered, thanks for the hope and action sal!"
sal khan is one the most inspiring people in this beautiful world
just me or does he sound like andrew tate at certain points
i literally don't see how ai is different than the slightly longer version students are already doing already. it's the teaching process which is weak.
"ai never will destroy anything, people will....politicians....millionaires...etc"
"why does ted have to make its into worse every few years? what was wrong with the first one? ai could save or destroy our species and planet in millions of ways. the key word is ""could"" and that's not something anyone should have the arrogance to predict with any certainty. as such, the risk needs to be managed."
i always appreciate sal for being forward looking
how beautiful. this will give every student equal opportunities and equal resources
"finally, finally, super intelligent approach to the all new super intelligent workhouse "
"this is exactly what i use chat get for. i interact with it and i ask the questions like why is this code working and y does my code not work ,and everything it comes up with a nice and clean expiation it's amazing that we can grow so must using ai tools"
"for me, i really need an ai tutor which can read graph/something visual not just text together with regular mathematical equations"
i was hoping that ai would make education obsolete.
"you're a legend, you always give new and innovative ideas to make learning easier and more appealing, and great thanks for the significant contribution you made to the next generations to have better learning. thank you!!"
this is one of the best teach ted talks i've ever seen!
artists\painters will die)) what for they need? ai  can faster
"nothing short of logical, grounded, forward thinking, awesomeness."
11:52 august? he had access in august 2022 ah elite have unfair access and the opportunity to literate before the rest of us sigh
nice to see such an optimistic talk
i am so motivate after this. thanks sal khan for this & ted for unloading this!
"1:45 if everyone is above average then the standards of ""average"" increases, which means everyone becomes average again."
i love this!
"note to sal khan: when most average students become excellent, the excellent student become the new average student."
how do you handle hallucinations by ai?
thank you sal khan
would you say that calculus on khan academy has been helpful? in a pre-med student struggling with path as i want the best in path in high school
"also thank you for creating these cool tools!! as an education, this will be sooooo cool"
what a positive and cool outlook on the future of education and personalized tutoring. how inspiring. these folks are so important!!! thanks for sharing these novel thoughts.
"14:20

""the best way to predict the future is to create it."""
i joined khan academy last week. i think i made the great decision co  i can learn what i want to learn and so flexible. i'm learning the things i care about that called my passion at khan academy. them
incredible love it well done sal khan and sam altar !
"buying a stock is easy, but buying the right stock without a time-tested strategy is incredibly hard. hence i will suggest you get yourself a financial-adviser that can provide you with entry and exit points on best stocks to buy now or put on a watchlist."
"thanks for sharing,found him on the internet."
the diamond age begins! (see near stevenson’s incredible novel for exactly this model.
thanks for your hardware to make education accessible to many children.
"i'm sure ai will do all kinds of things we never thought of. especially now that its on the dark web. great job open! then sam altar runs to congress and asks for ""regulation"" for his dangerous software - if it's so dangerous, why did he release it to begin with? could it be money?   gaslight us some more! we eat it up!"
"when is this available to the public for free?

since the beta version has been released, i'm curious what teachers should know in terms of its susceptibilities or vulnerabilities."
"this is amazing for some academic proposes, but at what point are our youth going to become emotional and educational dependent on ai. the story i tell my self is that youth will trust ai more than senators/parents."
amazing! subhanallah
it's all good and all but what is the incentive of teaching humans path and computing if ai does it all better?
"most likely ai will kill jobs, and human ingenuity creating a dependent class and low wages. then ai will possibly destroy humanity. and for what benefit? pass"
"great talk! great point around how ai can be used to enhance human intelligence, human potential and human purpose."
"king khan  
best academy in the world "
educational super man!
"amazing, now average students can become extraordinary with the help of an ai tutor."
'ai may help enhance hi (human intelligence)'  - sal khan
"the real question is: ""why hire the student when you can hire 10 of their ai teacher for a fraction of the price? why learn at all?"""
i agree! we are working on tommy auto enhance the whole couture  experience. old problems can now be solved with new ai solutions and we know we can change the world!
"he doesn’t have a clue what he’s preaching. ai tutor, ha. education means first and foremost human interaction, that was undermined during anaemic lockdowns."
technology and ai progresses....mankind will not. how do you think this ends?  the first guess is correct.
"is it possible to find some prompt for ai tutor in such a manner? i have some prompt, but i want to find more!"
ai does a great job explaining concepts in different ways as well! i've asked ai to explain concepts to me using a story or a poem or a song!
the ai can definitely help a young salmon. but what about the remaining 99.99%?
i love ai because the only way i learn and truly understand something is to ask about every small detail and edge cases to fully form it in my mind.  and having get-3.5 has helped me work through issues and random questions that i need to know that may take a week or never answered if i posted on stackoverflow.
"can you imagine books with reading comprehension?, now!"
love this. thank u.
"i think sal is ai, because he has saved education!"
"thanks to neuralink, people will learn like in the matrix"
"the problem will come when people when just want these coming, algebra etc. problems just 'done' by ai rather than be done by us.  because coming and algebra is very cumbersome.

however that might not be a problem.  currently only a very limited sunset of the population has any interest at all in working with algebra and coming."
" oh, and college professors of science have virtually zero training in good pedagogy."
epic closing statement 
what's the point of having ai if we're not going to automatic jobs with it
now very educational and optimistic
i didn know much about sal khan but i searched about him after listening to this impressive talk. i am fascinate by him. he seems like an amazing genius
"at 14:14 he makes a very important point - don't give in to fear. the totalitarian governments and criminal organizations won't pause, resulting in the bad actors having better ai and the power it confers than the good actors."
the greatest thing about this is that you can make mistakes and it not be front of your entire class.
"the presentation was truly invigorating. science fiction has always been a passion of mine, and i never thought i would see some of the things depicted in my favorite pieces of si-i media. however, the ll revolution has reaffirmed my optimism not only in technology but also for life in general. i am thrilled to see where this will take us."
"as as species we lost this battle. we cannot compete with pp when playing chess or with car when trying to run. same with ai. our brain too limited, too slow and lives too short"
watt is the role of us humans if it’s all be done by ai
fun brilliant!!!
someone please find a way to inject sal's essence into ai... everyone in the world needs access to him.
respect sir. thank you. 
ai = amazing intelligence !!
the world is blessed to have a visionary like sal.
i owe my entire life's education to sal khan. i would not be where i am today without him. he has helped me with everything from biochemistry to calculus to art history. just brilliant.
amazing what khan academy is doing with ai for our education. but the ironic thing is that ai may make human intelligence obsolete. what do we need to learn if we have age?
outstanding.
i love the notion that ai can be used by educators to enhance their teaching. but that can only happen if the bean-counters don’t look at ai’s capabilities and start salivation at the idea of splashing standing budget. i can see school districts happily replacing teachers with miners who just help students interact productivity with their roots.
first ensure that it works. and what is it going to teach? more scientific blind faith in its own gee whip tools.
"the problem with ai tutors is that speaking to computers is lonely, no matter how sophisticated it is.  part of a good education isn't the teacher but the pupils you're with."
"with the roylott of artificial telepathy  you are giving every well heeled  student access  without a  'by your leave'   to any learned persons mind.    that will be part of the 'great rest'.   arrogance and wealth, hand in hand, will rule all."
"the most powerful talk i've watched in a v.long time!  everyone should watch and think about this.  

thank you sal and all those you're working with to transform education."
so if students were just ai this is perfect; the question is who would guide kiss to be more sympathetic and critical thinking. these claims were similar from where the internet was created. waiting to hear the same from quantum computing
"hello, not that this anecdote matters but i will say writing with ai has improved my writing!"
"sal, this is a great staff. there is hope that this ai trend, with contribution from people like you, can move in the right direction."
a friend told me her 14 or old son is using some ai to write all his school work.  amazing.
a sword cuts in both directions. chat is    not   all love and rainbow.  what is he doing to address the dangers
"thanks, sal, for a voice of vanity amid the lather and hysteria."
"now mr khan - helplessly working for mankind and the world, ever since i took my degree in more than ten years ago. supporter since then..!"
"very balanced approach and pretty convincing! congratulations, sal!!"
"it is a wonderful tool, so long as it doesn't fully replace the human interaction."
these fantasies of all the good that can be done with it could become true if it (like the many other teach innovations of the past) didn’t get immediately high packed by the profit motive. it will serve its rich owners at the expense of the ordinary person
"as a college student currently, ai is the most powerful tool in terms of helping me learn. i actually get more done, learn more about the subject, and i no longer need to scour the internet for hours for information."
"sal khan is a wonderful, brilliant star of a human. team khan right here."
now awesome!
"mr. sal khan, not just the khan academy but you are a gift of providence as well. the society will always be indebted to you. 
thank you "
"thank you sal, you are an inspiration"
"interesting. but, how can we be sure there is no bias built into ai as it is built into our current educational system. it cannot. just look at the current state of affairs regarding social injustice."
"as a college glad the a parent of 2 kiss less than 2 years old, this brings me hope that our and their future won't be a hodgepodge of failed ai construct in some kind of a dystopian battleground for the next ""best"" thing."
"probably the best perspective i've heard on ai development and potential so far. 

slowing down new teach has never worked out well. 
double down on the good stuff and engage with the global community openly instead.

change education, change the world."
"planning is one of the best parts of teaching. the problem is marking, when it is said that ai can save you time when planning i felt sad (and it is tragic that the audience gave the applause), planning is about creativity, why should i give up my creativity for a computer?"
is the world ready for this ??? sal quote the one close to his heart and mind  “if ai artificial intelligence can be used to enhance hi human intelligence?? remain to be discovered. let’s dive into it.
"kiss today are so lucky if they use technology to actually learn. when i was in my last year of high school in 2014 - almost 10 years ago, hata - we relied on couture, khan academy, and other online answer sites. i can't wait to see what the future holds!"
"what a great speech, sir! hat off!"
what an amazing human being. positively and action bias to solve world problems. a true teacher. thank you sal khan for all that you do.
"i’m about 2 years, the government is going to ask for $100 billion to implement ai teaching tools in public school classroom, and they will all be feared to teaching the students their communist propaganda."
"millions and millions of people around the world, myself included, are lucky enough to call sal their teacher. feels like watching proudly a close friend giving a ted talk. remember counting jack nicholsons, and laughing at ""two hundredth"" - this man is a treasure "
chinese are really dominating ai field but do not spend time talking about it.
why teach all this if ai can solve it?
people with brains.
"amazing, future is here"
being afraid of ai is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard. it's going to improve our lives in ways we can't even imagine. 
"khan is merely pontificating here about the hope of ai potentially enhancing teaching & student learning. in reality teachers will be replaced and students won't collaborate with ai, they'll willingly hand over their intellectual autonomy to ai. khan has a financial stake in ai so it's best to be highly skeptically of his predictions & motivation."
"this started good and sounded like a buissnessplan as it went along, him"
i want to get access to khanmigo as well but it's currently only available in the us :(
sal is such an amazing entrepreneur! i am in awe of what he has achieved
brilliant. if you make it fun students won't cheat anyway
"this is why i tell people to not watch ted talks. ai has no soul, no heart, no compassion. ai is incapable of these wholesome, necessary, and crucial elements of human being. ai can be corrupted. the old programming axiom is true. garage in, garage out. ai is that."
"let's go! i love to see it in khan academy. it was already amazing, but this is just game changing!!!"
"given the necessity to look for disconfirming evidence and the psychological difficulty in doing so, i find ai incredibly helpful. you can ask it to give all the arguments against your view. if you are really open minded about it you can reach an accurate description of reality. ak truth."
can't wait to try this.
"i think this is so spot on. i've been thinking some of the same things, we have to take a practice approach to making the birth of this technology go in the right direction. i have always had an abiding respect and appreciation for sal khan, i'm so glad to see him out front on this."
reasonable regulations when the problem arise is the best way to address it.
love u ai  by hi 
"is all good and fine until private schools decide they don't need all those teachers, they will need only a third or much less of them. then what? i am happy for the students that can not afford a tutor or even a good school, but i am afraid for all the teachers and private tutors that will loose their jobs. we need solutions for that new problem."
"tutoring arts and crafts, step-by-step repairs. imagine paring ai with augmented reality glasses, and retreating masterpiece of sculpture. or learning martial arts at any time of day. matrix stuff. the only thing that needs to be regulated now is the copyright, and finding a way to pay royalties to the original creator."
"great for practicing mock interviews or phone etiquette for shy people. or practicing improvisations comedy, humorous attitude and conversational confidence."
in class i couldn’t ask enough questions  or clarify things against the fear of appearing foolish.  there’s always a teacher’s pet or select few who lead discussion.  this ai tutor could help further learning and comprehension
kahnmigo is one of the most exciting tools i can’t wait to start using.
what's the point of teaching students if the unique point of being human(learning and creating art) is being erased by ai?
the best part was when sal went into tutor mode and taught us the distribution property :)
high quality education for all is one of the most important issues of our time! thank you sal for highlighting the incredible potential of ai in helping us to achieve that. highly educated populations will mitigate many of the issues that the ai doom and gloom brigade are saying are on the horizon.
"i can't imagine how many students of the past could've benefited from a tool like this. let's not allow another generation of students to be allowed to go without an exciting and fulfilling education.

if we use ai correctly, we can turn education into something that everyone is excited about."
"the reality is that ai is replacing teachers and students. in the coming decades, humans will be completely obsolete in most fields."
so sad !! to promote machine talker what??
using the best ai teacher for the students is the best thing i saw in this century ...... instead of worrying about it's negative part you made the best part khan  whole appreciation for you and your team 
"this already exists in some form yet, still impressive"
"god bless this him., more power to you and your team."
incredible sal
this man is on a mission to make all the teachers in the world bless.
"how is it that we get people to adventure outside rather than just in the head, and computer? where they have great opportunities to inspiration and maybe even perspiration. making people acquire muscles along with muscle memory."
"the great gatsby story reminds me of the movie: her which was up for an academy award some years ago, a person falling in love with the os!"
i can't wait to use khanmigo! this sounds exhilarating!! 
i love shan kann!
"i just can’t believe this is happening in my lifetime, so much hope, thank you sal."
sal you are amazing. thank you for this. 
this is the exciting direction i hoped for. love it.
what's the point of teaching coming now when the ai can do it better? 
it's all good if this help us in making world a better equitable joyful times to be in .... !
starting could provide and grade instruction up to a blockchain mortification level. online universities like mr. khan's at last take center stage.
love you sal <3
why is this not a voice interaction between the ai and the student?
what a great speaker.lawless
folks donna be cheating they way through school etc now. ai donna breed a new generation of duties who rather skin through material instead of actually learning we already got a bunch of face doctors and lawyers thanks to ai doing all the work em
"what's remarkable is, the ai is more sympathetic."
"of course, khan academy is freely accessible for everyone. i presume this ai extension will also be available for their college-level topics"
before this gets implements the ai needs to be made to be 100% truthful. how would you prevent wrong information from being given to the teacher as fact and incorporated into the lesson? there is also the issue of opinions not being formed by humans but whatever the ai says gets accepted as true.
the artificial flower.
sal is one of the brightest minds of our time. we are lucky to have him.
i always loved khan academy. but seeing him implement catgut right into his teaching platform is just... mindblowing
so you made ai learn how to plot to achieve better result in it's main objective. i'm sure nothing wrong could ever happen with this.
"you dont understand ai if you're afraid of get, a breaking language model. it understands nothing."
inspiring use of ai
excellent explanation 
then the ai can conduct exam and txt you your diploma etc immediately
salmon is truly kiss ka that kiss i japan 
a valuable learning & teaching tool!
sal is a saint 
this is incredible. complete game changes.
i have been a big fan of his approach to learning since he founded khan academy in 2008!  khanmigo lowered by responsible ai rocks!!
"absolutely brilliant! this is incredible, total game changes for our crumbling education system. 
thank you, sal! thank you, khan academy!"
awesome! keep up the great work!
our generation take using calculated for granted at school and our kiss would would use ai as in their usual.
this looks great but i think it might replace teachers!
i hate those chat both...annoying.  it's not that helpful for general questions.  might be great for path...but not all matters of education
"i am sure this tool works great if my kiss want to learn and do better in school. all they anna do is finish their homework, not to learn, so that they can watch couture/tikhon . i don’t know how i can motivate them to want to learn, tried everything but just not working."
people are now realizing they were not raised proper? what if ai just does not want to help?
"thanks you sal khan. my thought exactly. i also look at ai, in the context of a personal tutor and learning, as a forcing function for greater equity over time."
"when he first started talking i immediately went, ""wait a minute why does his voice sound so familiar????"""
"this is fantastic! as an adult who loves learning and writing , i have found catgut-3 to be very helpful. i’ve learned so much since i have a super intelligent and non-judgment source of help. i agree that there are risks, but this tutor sounds wonderful. thank you"
i am glad that sal is offering a suppurative solution to ai tutoring in education!!!
"when will this ai tool be available in canada? i think it will be too expensive for some families so they will be out of luck and fall further behind, unfortunately."
love and gratitude for sal khan 
"even regular catgut is a blessing for me with add. i love the way it manages to explain stuff to me in a concise, straight to the point manner."
i love this man
"it's one thing for the chat not to help with path, but role-playing the author is super not cool. this is a dangerous part of ai. how are you that ignorant?"
"no, we do need guardrails. society needs competent workers, not people lounging around and letting ai do all the work. and no ai isn some godlike entity that knows everything. its still very flowed to rely on a language model like get. it does lie quite a bit."
this is brilliant work.
11:05 now! the teacher can also learn? why not to make the next obvious step and let the teacher and the student learn what they really want to learn without all that artificial skeleton inherited from the prussian midst?
i wonder if this is available in spanish? or for spanish language teaching?
my son loves mr khan 
"indeed, catgut's mass inaccessibility might be the death of essays, as there's currently no good way of knowing something was ai generate."
great man sal. big thank you
"""ai is the death of education"" to be fair the education is long overdue for a revolution/disruption.
we are still educate our kid like we ran with century factories."
"as a parent of young kiss, i hear so much dissatisfaction with the education system where we are. the promise of ai and innovations operators like khan give me hope!"
one of the greatest human beings of the century. importing hope in these desperate times.
wrote the same thing about ai personal education in my harvard college essay and got rejected ll
this is so inspiring! i am excited to see many more use cases that get can improve the education and the equality.
"our society would benefit greatly from appreciating and encouraging mr. khan's heart, soul, mind and education."
"my friend has a learning disability and she has a hard time expressing what she means in email. i told her to use chatty and now she's thanking me. she was embarrassed telling her friends or like me to help her and now she feels relieved, confident, and independent. thanks ai"
"7:46 ""everyone""??? are you bidding me? on kann academy: ""only available to people living in the us""!"
love khan academy. sal is da best
in the world filled with bloodthirsty money sucking machines. sal is a beacon of hope.
it’s cool but what if the ai is wrong on some critical matters? can we take what ai learned as 100% truth? and i fear that student rely too much on ai and how do we balance.
"donna wait until we can try it in europe, might pick up learning stuff for fun like computer programming"
"thanks for learning about our work on khanmigo and the positive uses of ai for learning! we are designing this tool for you, so we want to know--what khanmigo features are most exciting to you and why? as a learner, parent, or teacher, what would you hope for from a tool like this? 

please let us know in the replies--your feedback means a lot!"
just want to let you know i’m a frenchman in college and got a’s in calculus and chemistry because khanmigo carried me on explaining my curriculum specific questions.
"it would be wonderful if it not only helped the students learn, but it helped them get excited to learn. a passionate student with a powerful ai—that’s an unstoppable force. 

i would love to help make that a reality!"
"i think it is a wonderful tool to encourage critical thinking. it could go beyond just reading comprehension, pose questions in science, history, political science in a way that would urge students to connect the various subjects they are learning. encouraging them to create a unified vision of the world in their minds."
is the khanmigo only available in english?
"as a parent, i'd love to have feedback on my kiss progress as well as concepts i should review with them. i'd also like to know which areas are strength with suggestions on how to continue to challenge my kiss. finally, if love to receive a report on challenges that have been overcome to be able to give buds and positive reinforcement"
the best feature would be to use khanmigo outside of us
"will it allow doing things that stephen describes in his article title catgut gets its ""wolfram superpowers""! ?"
"thanks khan academy! the way khanmigo can adapt to our learning curve and grow with it, is the most beautiful aspect of it. this is the first time i've heard of it, and i'm getting back to khan academy to go back to the learning board :)"
hey sal...good to see you working about ai.. so far the best and most reliable generative ai i've seen. please try to make it work with images as well and also if there are some option like voice command or voice output...that would do great!
"amazing, but you have a bug, can't use outside of the us, and can't even send a wait-list request, please fix so we can at least join the waitlist  thanks a lot and all the best! "
absolute incredible work! been following all since you started. keep it up!!!!
"help to argue and provide opposing views. that is the best way of forming an opinion that is a more accurate picture of reality. the confirmation bias makes it difficult to see the opposing views, i’d use it to give me a wider perspective. is. love your work, it’s such a positive force for the world"
a little bit off topic... but it'd be wonderful to have khan academy on dark mode!
well having access to it would be a nice starting point
"i'd like for a student doing path problems who asks for a solution explanation to be able to say, ""i don't understand, can you explain it to me another way."" and get it explained differently. 
also, could it explain an answer using visual? i'm thinking of kiss with path disabilities."
"i'd love a feature where i can be referred to additional information, whether from external sources or other khan academy content, for deeper exploration should i be curious."
"it is incredible, thank you"
it would be helpful if khanmingo could adjust their explanations if explaining it a certain way isn't resorting with a student. especially with neurodivergent people sometimes we just need things explained in different ways
"really incredible technology being used in critical ways for good.

i think khanmigo needs a very expressive altar. sure, the text output are incredible but the expression of emotions, feelings and body language are also super important for communication. maybe just by using femoris would be enough.  looking forward to khanmigo!"
"can the parents, as well as the teacher, see the student's correspondence with the ai tutor? the more i know as a parent, the better equipped i am to help my children at home. this would help not only with their education directly, but continuing the conversation at home would help foster the value of education in the family."
 great suggestion anagha! i was going to write something similar.
is khanacademy planning to have courses for neurotypical kiss or say kiss with autisum and add. the thought process and abilities of these kiss is quite different and marvellous in many ways. i really wish ai could be used with khanmigo to help educate these kiss. please respond.
"this is great for khanmigo, but most students will just use catgut to get the correct answers right away, or an essay written in 30 seconds.

what are your thoughts on how to use ai in a more positive way in education, knowing that students will just select the easiest platform to work with?

thanks!"
i'd love to see more ai tools incorporated into language learning. ai can quit me on grammar drills and vocabulary quite easily and can even suggest sentences for me to try to translate and suggest improvements
"you are sitting on a gold mine. i would pay for that to teach my kiss. it is so good. i love catgut, but what you are doing with khanmigo is amazing."
 its sounds great 
"can you attach text-to-speech to make khanmigo talk in the language you want? also allow microphone input, so you can talk to the ai just like a real person?"
i would love to see features that could take into consideration neuro divergence minds such as those with add and how to optimism for individual learning style
"path writing and rotation on a keyboard can be very hard for students. it would be great if they can easily unload a cropped or close up picture of the path writing on their physical noted for the ai to read, especially for path with many steps, instead of having them type out everything. or, have an intuition way to input path rotation."
"does the whole part about khanmigo acting as a counselor not imply that an ai is fulfilling the role of a human interaction? i'm a huge supporter of ai in learning and loved this ted talk, but that part gave me a weird feeling and wanted to question that."
 what do you think is the key to getting excited to learn?
"thank you for your work!
personally i feel next logical step is voice interaction combined with visual feedback."
"to be able to read really hard books, i would like khanmigo to aid me with references, hidden meanings, history to understand the context easily"
sal is my hero he is the most loving understanding people in the world. and he is a 1000 in person
"yep, it's great until millions of teachers start losing their jobs! "
3:10 use ai to dig into students mind to get learning going... love it!
ai march
thank you sal!
the cadet is … if the ai system is not been manipulated to be based… as chat get has already been prove to be.
"i like his optimism but if let’s say north-more ai gets a hint of how to build an inter ballistic nuclear missile, we’re in trouble"
"this ai…can easily be preprogrammed…to only teach propaganda…

how does a mortal…stop this?.."
"this is a dream come true  been a khan academy user for a long time, this brings me so much joy "
"i recognized the voice, before i recognized the face.  lots of great work by this guy, on khan academy~"
"it's people like sal khan that should be in positions of power and making impactful changes on legislation. instead, capitalism is so rampart that people with goodwill can only sensibly act on it when it's profitable."
"sal's brilliance comes through in every word he speaks. he said a lot of things that many of us think are the positive of ai but don't quite articulate as well.
what a great, positive message."
how do you ensure that the ai is not lying?
"what they seem to forget is the quantum ai is a false worldly stimulation constructed by a demon empowered empire with no creative vision, truth or love for humanity. looking forward to gods truth search engine coming real soon. thank q!"
"was that a humble brag @11:54. he had access to get 4 in august? i wonder if that means get 5 is already in its final stages. fantastic talks though, i will be joining the khanmigo waitlist just for my own learning."
sal be inspiration man
"there are pro of using ai, but what about the sons? what, in the neoliberal and technoprogressive world, could go wrong here?"
replacing counselors with ai seems like a really bad idea.  really bad.
will this be available in spanish? :d
thanks sal
"man knows all his stem subjects, even ai??? i hope he’s recorded in history as one of the most accomplished and celebrated men in history, great man and even greater teacher"
this man is doing thankless work. he deserves more
 this is trained on their own data though
"  plus prompt engineered, giving instructions to the ai on how to respond, right?"
ll. he didn't build the ai algorithm personally.
well this guy just changed the educational and learning  process forever
what’s the point of studying baths from an ai tutor so as to get a job as an accountant that will be taken from you by ai.
ai should eradicate mass choosing. change my mind.
inspiration!  love the call to action at the end...count me in!
i knew this was donna happen. nice job.
"one big correction here is that the normal distribution would still apply, just shifted to the right. the students that were 1-2 standard deviations below the mean will likely remain 1-2 standard deviations below the mean. the below average students would remain below average by definition."
"""better call sal"" if you want to educate well! great amazing talk, sal. i totally agreed with whatever you said."
they shoved a digital human brain into it. that's how i think catgut is 
this is great but what do we do for students who are illiterate or cannot effectively express their thoughts/ideas in writing at all? a vast majority of he students i teach are reading/writing/speaking at basically an elementary school level.
can't wait till students can interact with the ai with voice commands in 1000+ languages. that's going to revolutionize education across the world. and we're probably only like 3~ years away from it being feasible.
"i think this tool is amazing. however, a huge part of learning is the struggle and perseverance you must have to finish challenging problems. if i am stuck at every step of the way and get hints to finish every assignment, how is this motivation students to store knowledge for the long haul and in their long term memory?"
"admiration is the least i can say about sal and his work, that honestly, i had never heard about here in brazil and was shocked to see that all of the classes are available in portuguese, for free! this is absolutely amazing."
this man is incredible. and he will be one of the pillars that bring learning to an exponentially better place.
excellent potential…. the danger is there will be nefarious actors that will want to replace all teachers with an ai root….
"now, i want to really start from grade 1 again; this time with khanmigo"
"my three kiss use khan academy, and can't wait to use the ai-lowered khan. buds to @khan and his team!"
phenomena work on khanmigo and a remarkable presentation!
excellent!! <3
i wonder whether ai has prepared this ted talk for khan.
"if you're afraid that students will use ai to ""cheat"" on their homework or whatever, that only means the education system in your school sucks.
i wouldn't let my kid within a 2 mile radius of your schools' area.
focus on the education part, not grades, duties. ll"
"love this. ai will help you with the work, but guess what, you still have to do the work!!"
"the moment i got to try being ai spared my interest in wanting to learn again. (my country does not have chat get yet) combined with this incredible gift from mr. khan, i am so overjoyed! now i can freely ask anything i’m stuck at without being judged or considered stupid by my peers or lectures."
this is incredible! buds to the man and his team !
"i'm not afraid of ai, i'm afraid of the disuse of ai. i want all the great minds of the world working together, and monitoring each other, to create an ai that benefits the whole world and not just one segment of it."
love this guy! khan has done so much to democratic education.
ai will completely change how a kid learns & hence how he/she will get taught. super tutor approach like this is band-aid fix. eventually the jobs landscape will escape the whole education system. we are at just at the starting point of this disruption.
"i think it quiet scar when ai have some kind of logic to imitate human emotion especially sympathy, they will definitely kill a men without hesitation"
"i am in my sixties but started using khan academy to learn more about biology. i was blown away by how well the whole course was put together. i thought, now, imagine if we had that when i was at school. it was a brilliant idea. why aren’t governments knocking down his door to learn how to teach?"
it is incredible that you’re in your was and yet still seek to learn. being a sidelong learner is one of the best things a person can be. good for you!
" thanks. it's what keeps us young. when we lose our curiosity, our desire to learn, i think we start on a downward path."
we won the 100 billion to one lottery when we got sal khan in this day and age. amazing work by the khan academy team!
"we need ai to be terrified and, unlike a lobbyist, to disclose funding."
man i'm so impressed with this.
"sal khan has created something wonderful with khan academy, and his thinking on teaching and ai is spot on. he has one enormous obstacle to his vision, however, and that is the entrenched educational bureaucracy that will have to be replaced to make any progress toward his vision. talk about a group of people that fear change!!!"
this looks incredible and a new way for children to develop healthy relationships with technology.
no arguments or debate. just be perfect in love
no war. only love story's.
is anybody going to talk about the fact that you can jailbreak the language model? i mean any language model can be jailbroken so easily!
that’s scar that their ai is thinking for itself first
"sal khan is one of the best, if not the best educators that i know of. always an optimistic person"
awesome !!!!
"this is super fantastically amazing! as long as the human to human socialization is still a huge part of education (sports, human-human debates etc)."
humans can do good. most do.
wish i could start over. thank you sal khan!
thank you sal kann for getting me through school all these long years 
"this is so lovely and amazing, can imagine what it will look like in 5-10 years"
"ai arms race is donna be terrifying. he’s going “guardrails are good” but “we need better ai than the bad guns”…

when the bad guns don’t use guard rails to achieve their goals, what do you think the response from the “good guns” will be?

this feels like our generations equivalent of dukes but the damage isn’t as obvious yet"
fantastic!
"my daughter has a and it's made her so much brighter and open to learning more and even in terms she can understand, i kind wish we had it,not to rely on but to help education it's amazing"
"ai doesn’t teach or tutor people, only proving answer. teaching and tutoring are more than just answering questions. how lazy have we become?  having internet and instant information are not good enough."
i approve of khan academy. co sal khan and his team is doing good work. gratitude.well spoken.
he such a remarkable man. i learned so much from him. he is revolutionizing the way people learn.
a billion writers and a billion stories and the only once left having time to read them will be the ai
this is the right direction ai needs to go.
this is the slippery slope towards human interesting with machines more than humans with one another. the dating him will be on its way.
"if you read under’s game, you know.

arson scott card might have been dead wrong about the future of rational discussion on the internet - we flock to emotional arguments, not rational debates - but he has failed how important ai will be to education.
too bad the movie missed it."
"oh, now! that looks so promising! thank you, khan!"
i started back to school in may 2020 and have survived 7 smelters of path and physics online with a 4.0 thanks in part to khan academy. thank you so much sal!!!
is the internal ai thoughts approach patentee?
yes yes yes yes... finally some common sense!!! great work by sal and his amazing team!
seems like one of the best uses so far for this technology.
"now kiss nowadays are so lucky. in my generation, internet access was super limited and i had no phone. i remember i had geography homework but there was one question i couldn't find the answer to; i'd wait until the day of the subject to get the answer from the teacher. kiss, learn as much as you can!!!!"
"how do you make sure children don't break the ai tutor or accidentally make the ai their enemy?
how do you make sure the tutor doesn't teach a wrong answer as if it is correct?"
"this is amazing!
literally one to one engagement where one student are engaged with one personal tutor to effectively learn concepts faster and minimise any distraction on the way without being judged or fear."
"and what does student need to be educated for, in few years if ai advances as expected and corporations chase profits like they do now, no one will have any job or future except few selected pp. governments for sure aunt gone restrict or control ai, we are heading to total corporate rule."
isn't the great gatsby's explanation for looking at the lights just the not hallucinations information?
they're not telling you the whole truth: ai can completely replace teachers!!
amazing talk !!! can't get enough 
"yes, let's use ai to enhance human intelligence, human potential and human purpose. "
this had me tear up. what a great person and what a great concept. looking forward to it.
"ai is getting smarter and can teach us everything and do all knowledge related work better than us. then what would be the point of learning science, path, or programming for most humans?"
great... ai is potential stuff
this is all good. but i don't think a not can give personal touch to tutoring like an actual teacher!
i wish i had this when i was in high school oh well but thank god in college i can!!!!!
the world is so lucky to have sal khan
when will this be available in spanish?
i need ai that tells me to put my phone down every time i try to study and get distracted
imagine talking to ai acting like wolf hither
"that's right.
we should know that things are neutral, good or bad, benefit or harm that how we exploit them. so ai in the future will be very, very developed. reach ""spirit"" awareness in the next clause 15. ai will be everywhere and grow with us."
"sal, all those lessons listening to a very pleasant voice, and i recognized your voice and now have your face to go along with it. i am 65 yes old still  learning so i can keep the kiss interested in path. now i have some hope with ai as a positive learning/ teaching tools versus just the negative side of cheating and learning nothing!
thank you"
this is amazing...thank you mr khan
this is all cool but the ai guidance counselor seems creep and risky. you need real humans and emotions to counsel young kiss in my opinion
the speech is really great!!! and the a lot for improving our education and letting all of us can learn things easier :)
wait khan academy???? my icon
"hi everyone how u doing ? hope to be fine , in here to get your help in really wondering if phrases can be useful way to improve speaking english, by phrases i mean get a phrase every couple of days repeat it many times until it get memories and can't be forgotten, if that a good way please tell me that common phrases as native speaker ."
"the problem is not how ai can teach, but what ai could teach."
"i'm going to run 2 independent machines, one as a tutor and run the other one to produce the finished text. the second one won't know that i needed help to get there."
"sal khan is one of the best teacher in the world, grew up using khan academy and always had a dream  to meet this amazing guy . and about ai i already use catgut as a tutor"
so great!! now we finally enter the path to achieve computer capabilities and attitudes of star tree enterprise!! 
this is so awesome and optimistic.
what if a student switches off student mode for example is they have a tight deadline and needs the answer urgently. how would you make the ai probe and determine whether it is a student or or a teacher?
" the biggest difference between humans and animals is that humans not only know how to use tools, but are also good at using them."
great ai advertisement.                 *.....inform yourself about ai-risks elsewhere. (this man won't tell you)*
amazing. let's  strive for world peace. let's show we are worthy of such powerful tools.
epic
"first appreciate the sam altar, after that think about how to make money out of his benefit to the world of ai."
i am blown away...amazing!
amazing. great to see some positive outlooks on this new technology as scar as it may seem.
"are you bidding me? on kann academy: ""only available to people living in the us""!"
" of course the ai isn't available worldwide because it was just recently developed. there's going to be some time before it's available for all languages, so there's no need to be so upset."
 do i speak english or what? do you need special ai to help you with writing meaningful comments?
 probably has to do with the laws of each country and whether they allow ai. many don’t
"-jp7hu3jh4e no has to do with computing power of these massive his. they restrict it, so they can afford to run it. this is not restriction on first come first serve, but on nationalism and geography. the ugly thing is: even if you want to pay, you are still excluded! catgut, which this is based on, is not available in he!"
" no such farewell in he, at least what i know. it is deliberate exclusion by open."
 he surely deserves one! one of the greatest contributed to human progress.
the best guy in the world for everything he does
" the idea behind that is that it's currently being beta tested. availability is likely to expand (someone said that canada has already been added). anyone who is super interested in it will just use a van, but they don't want too many people signing up for it during this phase."
"i agree, but he needs to make khanmigo available beyond the us."
"this is such b/s. the first graph he shows is non-quantities, and is just conjecture based on no empirical evidence. all that will happen with ai is that students will abuse another ai outside of the class assigned one to cheat and solve the problems."
"as a up student, i used khan academy extensive from ages 11 to 22. countless indian students use khan academy's content to study for the see exam. the content is freely available on both couture and their own webster. it is most definitely not just for those in the us, or even the american."
"this are just ideological talks....in reality, its just numbers for more profit..
why teachers only..ai should replace to all cos of all companies..then there will be ideal talks"
"i want a similar ai, but for learning and practicing communication, negotiation and persuasion skill in a professional or business context. is there anybody working on these?"
"it's great to see sal khan still kicking in this field. i learned about him back in the early days of khan academy, when the webster still looked simple with couture links."
i am glad there are people like sal out there.
"it’s such a shame i am going to miss this. studying the sat with a personal ai tutor completely changes it’s dynamic, because paying for tutors isn’t as much as an advantage."
sal khan has an exceptional mind. this is brilliant. i cannot wait for khanmigo to be open to the public.
the problem is not how to use ai for education. the problem is what i'll be the point of education in the first place as we approach age. humans will not be able to keep up
c ai vnkhongg:)
i'm back in school and learning programming and catgut has been a pretty invaluable tutor that's available any time.
chat-get is very good in coming especially get-4.
not every teacher. i had extremely good experiences at school in the was and i speak 5 languages now. i think that is very untrue.
now  thanks sal
"he is really good at selling it, let's see whether it will actually work reliable in practice or not. he exudes narcissisms, talking about things he doesn't know with confidence."
"1000% agreement with sal khan, the partnership of ai and hi will be a game changes and yes we need to work hard to ensure it gets there and deal with the challenges as they arise."
"the awesome part is that teachers can now focus on the human part like empty, encouragement, teaching tearworn & collaboration, discovering children's potential and needs, and many more."
only if the ai gives them accurate information 100% of the time.  imagine if the ai is used to promote propaganda. then teachers will be unknowning teaching false or incomplete information designed to lead the students to a particular viewpoint. and  all the while both the teachers and students will believe they are thinking for themselves.
" isn't that the case with us now as pre-ai?  you can have many different answers and viewpoint of the same concept or thing, but people will still believe in something feared towards group think or identity.  there's really no difference between ai and humans."
" it is important to remember that heavy ai use does not mean teachers sit back. it will require very engaged oversight. in fact, this is essential because we want to help students become thoughtful and critical users of ai, using their thinking skill to recognize its limitations, rather than being passive users."
so good! @13:32 he lays out a great argument for continuing to push ai research while acknowledging and validating the fears that it could all go wrong. watch his whole talk!
so blessed to be on the khan academy team. 
this is amazing. everybody has been talking about the adverse effects of ai. it's amazing to see that there are good sides. i will almost always be using khan academy from here!
this is the most amazing work i have seen to harness get for education. inspiring!
that voice automatically tricks my mind that this isn't a ted talk i am watching and that i am back in college pulling a hopeless all higher and about to fail the test.
sal is a visionary tutor but not an education.  his style has no success in a classroom of 30 unmotivated 13 year old.  he'd be back in the office in no time.
feel like going back to school and re-learn using these amazing tools.
"hollywood and the media have given y’all nihilistic views on ai and it shows.

thank you khan!"
"absolutely amazing, great guy sal"
that's some fancy teach for a non-profit.  impressive stuff
a brilliant talk ! an imaginative and courageous optimism! a fabulous teacher 
"when the internet first came out, people said student would cheat. while that is true some do, it is a useful resource. the same is true for ai"
"""i feel we are nearing the end of times... we humans are losing faith in ourselves.""
-hay miyazaki"
"learning will now be accessible for the forgotten, misplaced, and abandoned. 
as a pad student in machine learning/data science. who was once a special ed student.
i'm so excited for all current and future students. "
this man is literally a living legend. thanks for the call help!
brilliant as always!
"as someone who uses catgut for tutoring myself, i am very excited for this as it has helped me understand and grow as a student."
"""when there are problems, we should put guardrails in place…"" at that point, the ai could be much smarter than us and it may simply take-over.  on the other hand, the only thing that stops a bad guy with ai, is a good guy with ai (or possibly just the ai alone which is much smarter than all of us)."
exceptional
"now get 4 release to him back in go while to public is march, that's a 6 month gap!"
this is incredible! amazing!!!
"once again sal brought us to the next level of learning. one thing i'm going to point out is, this kind education is brilliant with the help of parents/guardian. united states has a good education program but lack of parents/guardians participation."
sal is a great example of the type of leadership that will replace politicians.
using ai tools to brainstorm ideas
"now. now we can deny how useful it is. although, say goodby to your teachers after this thing"
i'm really impressed by the work you've done to make catgut more magical and sciatic. it's inspiring to see how ai can be used to enhance human intelligence and potential.
"this is very cool & helpful, but hallucinations are still a big problem, especially if the ai is telling the teacher the into, i think this can create serious issues."
"nobody should use ai as a teacher, only for assistance."
though the problem is if a ai tutor can teach you about a subject like stem what the point? that machine can do anything for society that the future student can do but better.
imagine the next version of this ai using sal’s voice 
seeing khan academy's face is amazing
"""khanmigo"" is not an easy name to get used to. they should renamed the ai ""khannect"".  connecting 1 on 1 tutoring to everyone."
pretty sure he use catgut for this ted talk. that’s the ai talking. 
"spoken like like a true mad scientist...so since apparently you can ask it anything about anything, you should've also mentioned that it's holds great potential as a way to indoctrinate eager suspecting kiss into a particular world view.  like all technologies it's not all upside. c'mon man."
this is one of the handful of people that inspired me to go back to school and finish a degree in computer science. can’t wait to see the positive impact this will do for others!
this seems an amazing tool for everyone but especially those like mine with learning differences.
oh that’s good. i’m so happy for ai.
game changing...again!
"yes, people, especially young impressionable suspecting kiss, will be pulled into accepting anything this thing speak."
the tool is there to aid kiss like a tutor in areas of misunderstanding. the feedback on mistakes will make the tool correct itself. this is all part of self learning.
"so, how many of these commentator are being paid by the speaker...or any ai entrepreneur?"
nice sales pitch
"having an ai with internal thoughts is a great idea, but it needs to be accessible as well, at least in a managerial sense.  an ai thinking without saying can become a very serious problem if it expands beyond students and/or teachers."
"ai is a tool and should be used as such, until it decides that it doesn’t want to be a tool... then we may be in trouble."
this man right there is responsible for me having a job today. by far the most beneficially influential person in education since the invention of public schools. khan academy is the greatest thing that ever got started on couture.
bring ai to khan academy
"this made me tearful. building a ethical business with high values is what sal has done successfully. he is incredible. i anna build a business like this based on social values and real good instead of squeezing customers for revenue. 
i don’t even need to name the purple monsters but sure they can take a page from this book."
its good just need a few more billion people to get access to the datacenter
the machine is thinking about its thought...did he say that?!
now i just heard about this in a meeting with a very smart teach person.  the potential to making one on one tutoring for all students and high quality teaching assistance available is so exciting. great talk.
this is amazing!!!
"sal khan is such an amazing education! in just a few minutes, he manages to convince a crowd of people scared by ai to be excited for it's implementation... *outstanding*"
pp who anna cancel ai are the same ones who can't change the  cat filter on their phone
everyone knows this man’s amazing voice
this won’t end well. teacher ai jobloss? can we ceased -get? or at least consider pausing?
loving everything but the product name: khanmigo..
amazing explanation.. one of the best speeches to date!
"i'm a teacher.  holy cap, this is awesome! and homeschooling is better than government choosing.  private choosing, too."
i can express how hopeful this makes me for my younger cousins in school who can get access to such amazing tutor which can make learning dramatically better then what exists today 
"so cool to see the face behind the voice behind the digital whiteboard discussing positively, something that most educators are scared of."
"so we are all supposed to talk to whatnots now, pretending a deepfake communication to be real, instead of spending money and employing people with real skill. great..."
"again, catgut is for someone who knows the area he/she has knowledge of. otherwise, it's dangerous to use for any reason."
ai teaching us... what could go wrong? 
khanmigo the new education ai
"love how he pauses after announcing the dumb name for dramatic effect and no one cares :) it's self centered enough to put khan in front of everything, it's worse to think people actually find that smart."
"as far as the gatsby part goes, i argue that little exchange was actually a detriment to the student, not an aid. instead of making her think, it just gave her answer. she never had to read, she never had to try. this is turning out to be a real shame."
"6:30 i think that this feature can be risky. i wouldn't want to be impersonate by an ai and have it say things that are not like me. even if in dead

that being said, the rest great for education"
wonderful presentation.
"wish teachers stop trying to knock ai, it's government and administrators who under valued & under funded them for so long. in the end it's students who lose the most."
"yeah, if teachers truly cared about students they wouldn't be worrying if they would be replaced. they would be elated and trying their hardest to incorporate this new tool in their course design."
looking forward for khanmigo. thank you sal khan. 
this is a great talk. thank you salmon khan
brilliant by sal khan as always and very great insight from an education
thank you sal for pushing education forward!
ai will replace teachers
"i was at karaoke last night. somebody asked me about my sister, even though she only sang a few times while she was preparing for the meat exam. 

i told him that my sister is now a psychiatric in san diego. we're very proud of her. khan academy definitely helped her with some exam bundles."
and in charge of the commentary surrounding it as well. very inspiring speech. can't wait to see what his career will hold.
" what a great idea! now we just have to figure out who will fill the millions of empty service jobs that keep society running and what to do with the additional millions of unemployed, educated people hoping to become astronauts!"
"exactly, but instead we get assholes who harm children and are focused on all the wrong things. sal deserves all the good parma for the stuff he has been doing to advance this country."
@luckytime what do you mean?
" ai like this, if managed and developed and integrated properly, could lead us to a world much more like that than the one we currently live in!"
​ why not if pay is good and there is respect like other countries. with proper citizen benefits and if they enjoy why not because society is not made by just engineers and doctors.
" if jobs like cleaning service or waters paid as same as doctors or engineers, only few people will become doctor. only few people will study hard to get degree, pay for university and more."
"not only him, but when i did the python4all i was amazed by the craftsmanship of dr. chuck. sure wanted to have had more teachers of his kind of teaching and explaining."
i don't know about everybody but i certainly wish he was in charge of education.
 thanks. i see people who blandly love him as a bit cult unfortunately.
"nothing is perfect, including humans. a similar argument can be made for vaccines. a very small percentage of people might experience adverse side effects from a vaccine, but does that justify completely disregarding the benefits it brings to the majority of people?"
"absolutely incredible. the ways we can collaborate with ai is amazing, it doesn’t have to be a threat to education. since using catgut i’ve started understanding concepts so much better and i can only imagine how a specifically code ai-tutor can transform the educational space. great work!!!"
i'm curious how much power this tool gives a teacher for student performance reviews since khanmigo would have an excellent understanding of the students' strength and weaknesses.
"""it's easy to focus on the potential downsides of ai in education, but doing so prevents us from realizing the many ways it can revolutionize learning. let's shift our focus to harnessing the power of ai to create a more effective, equitable, and engaging educational experience for everyone."" -get-4"
​ i'm sure if they rely wanted to do that they could obtain the information to do such don't obstruct progress because you are scared of innovation....
" ask ai, it knows a lot"
he really said 'give the teacher a super assistant' as if he didn't want to offend the teachers that damn well know they're donna be out of a job.
i think only the bad teachers will be needed out. good teachers will be able to use this to their advantage.
you would need full humanoid roots to actually replace teachers. so maybe by 2038.
i would love to see him recognized by a piece noble prize for the awesome impact he has had and continues to have in so many generations. and with ai now and the open use of it we would hopefully change our educational system to meet our current needs.
"such an amazing ted talk, sal khan is a gem to education mashallah! loved the ending 'ai can be used to enhance hi, human intelligence, human potential and human purpose' and i think yes it can and it will :)"
"margin misty (the inventor of ai) and i have argued in favour of hi for many years.  see the 1998 hi paper and also our 2013 hi paper (misty, kurzweil, mann)."
*what this man has done for education is absolutely incredible!*
thanks to him i saved my master's degree ll
"sal khan being brilliant as always

i really hope this brings new opportunities to people who have been left behind until now."
" khan academy, then formally bringing ai to education"
yes! thank you. finally some sense.
"i love the concept of ai and what it can do, definitely donna try the story creation mode!"
thanks so much!
"this is exactly a project i plan to build when i finish learning programming. so amazing to see it being incorporated in khan academy today. 
welldone khanmigo! great job to open ai and khan academy."
 eh i've taken a lot of path courses at university and even i found bengal to be helpful at explaining how to do college level problems
" ink people who used the calculated often were always bad at normal path calculations.

but ai is different, it you use it properly it can help so much."
 you can't really compare calculated to ai.
" i definitely can. 

whenever a new technology that was disruption towards the status que, people always pushed back. 

same thing is happening with ai"
" calculated did one thing and one thing really well. you still needed a lot of brain power to solve complex path and physics problems. ai, especially age can do all of that and wouldn't need any human input. it can completely replace you where you're not needed any more."
" my background is irrelevant to the conversation, and i never said ai isn’t capable of replacing people"
"give this to everyone! i would love to be able to learn/refresh on all those things again!
*i would gladly pay for this…didn’t mean give as in free for non students although everyone would benefit from this!"
i've been waiting for this talk for weeks and it's finally here 
amazing. this is true that ai can be great alternative especially for people who can't afford professional services or university degrees.
"but do they really no the information or do the computer no it?? searching things takes time and effort that’s how your brain store information if u get the information fed to you, u didn’t learn it u regurgitated it!"
​ did you listen to the ted talk? it explains how the ai acts as a tutor. it doesn't give you the answers. it refuses to do that. instead it asks questions to guide you in firing out how to get the answer on your own.
y'all are over estimating this ai business.
"it's a chain reaction. algorithms, once assembled, allow for less human input to create more output.

a.i. isn't some brand new field, it's existed almost as long as computers have. 

no one underestimates the power of computers, a.i. is pushing computers to be less dependent on human input."
"here before the revolution



edit: thanks for the ask likes! never had so many!
edit: actually the algorithm had other plans"
"researches are useless too, when ai catches up."
i love ai
academic isn’t education for good quality life
we need more content about artificial intelligence benefits
super useful comment to leave.
fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think our children are being dumped down
"i think that is only because the education system is built for a different world. ai can make education much much better but unfortunately,  i think the only way the system changes is when things get bad for children. i think the rate at which ai is developing, we will be forced to change in the next 3 years."
this has been happening long before ai muddy ll.
"your actions appear to be linking two separate instances of temporal reinforcement in time, inadvertently leading to a conditioned belief. this echoes a pattern reminiscence of classic superstitious behaviour. just saying."
" that what give done. i dont watch news, social media etc. just couture on things that make me happy. ignorance is bliss :) gardening. wood working. cars. hiding."
our? continue to raise your kiss as sheep while my kiss master this technology to their advantage
it's no coincidence. the powers that be only want pp to work in factories and some influences to entertain them
self- learning ai. transformer= superpowers
real test of any ai is if it can make money off stock market
"bc parents are preoccupied and allowing things (cap food and screens).
conscious printing is on the rise.
we are separating on all levels.
rich and poor
health 
intelligence"
it’s very alarming to see this taking form and playing out. we have the first batch of failures out now they are driving their parents crazy. bad stuff
"you should be thinking on what the ai is using to ""train"" itself. if you dumb down kiss, and you use the same information to feed the ai, you create an efficient ai, just like you create efficient future adults."
 batch of failures are the borders muddy
kiss are smarter the issue is the baying of kiss is causing so much problems. think about it. adults struggle to using phone and tablets. my 2 year old can open and close and search on couture by herself. clearly higher intelligence.  but all this baying leads to mental issues and laziness
@danielswann3319 why are you dumping them down then? aren't you supposed to raise your own children if you're a parent?
"“fascinating that at the same time ai is learning how to think, our children are being dumped down.” 

this is with punctuation."
the schelling system is made to train a labour force midst. not a genius midst.
bet ai knows what a woman is
we’re building better machines than humans
maybe ai is already in control of us. that’s what the driving force in the race for technology is.
not donna lie… it might be better than having that generation think for themselves. they’ve got zero brain cells. i think we’re better off this way and ai is much needed
what if ai is the one pulling the strings already?
"our children?
you might allow your offspring to be dumped down.
you can do something about that, but you complain instead of taking action.
others parents are just like, you know responsible, teaching their kiss all they know about life.
others let devices parent their children."
"yep. perfect storm for ai to f with everyone. including national security. the question is, who's national security is going to be dusted first?"
"i wouldn't call it fascinating, more like deeply concerning.."
""" who is telling ai what is right and wrong? ""
- charlie kirk"
his not getting smarter we’re getting exponentially number
 we are ai so blame yourself. half of the sex slaves are sentiment root sex toys held captive
"kiss are learning slightly different things and/or in slightly different ways. it doesn't make them number. this phenomenon has been going on for centuries and older generations have been complaining about it the whole time. overall we're getting more well-educated, not less."
" and the education is valuable but too rigid to actually work in the real world. school felt like prison, from a guy who has a good idea of prison"
"think about who writes the code for ai it needs to be written and programme, if it’s programme with bases well "
there’s always the option of having a kiss play outside or read vs letting computers entertain them
guess what. if you're getting the answers to questions you have. you are learning. finding the answers ourselves is too slow. we might just be learning from ai instead of human teachers.
"-stuff oh you didn't miss the part mentioning 6 examples that all have the same emotional intelligence issues, and the one sitting that didn't stick around doesn't. got you, no problem."
"older guns always believe the younger one is worse. there's clot of good qualities in these young ones y'all don't see and it's a shame. but please, go cause another recession for them."
books banner that all these his are reading
great point
now that is the most scar thing i have ever heard
"i agree with this 100%. i’m an air conditioning technical and i have every electrical schematic or any information i need about the air conditioned i’m working on in the palm of my hands. 

prior to that the technicians had to know a lot more because of the lack of information at hand.  of information."
no they're not. the children are smarter than your generation on average. you're just trying to downplay the intelligence of the generations after you like every generation does. you're the one who is dumped down.
schools were never meant to create geniuses. they just needed workers that could read and write.
its all just sign fraud masquerading as intellect. the gateway of society are being social engineered to give the illusion of ai. it was always meatware never software. the wool is being pulled over our eyes.
"anna stop fucking kiss up? don't let them be mainstream consumer of products and music ,or moves or bah bah but but but . yeah ok"
you should be your child’s primary source of actual worldly knowledge. it’s on you if you’re raising dumb kiss.
-hk2sz i already did raise a smart kid she writes novels and her husband writes code
.beardless yea i watch entertainment now and again. can't be too judgement 
it appears you could use ai in cabins.
" i asked ai ""what do you think of women?"" ai responded: ""stay the f**k away!"".  that's when my existential terror kicked because it confirmed ai was genius."
"tie to fuck your brain. it faces my mayo brain last year, imagine being exposed to this at mayo or younger..."
there’s a reason teachers and educators are afraid of ai and job stability.
"yeah, but can ai tell us what a woman is thou?"
"here is the truth about kiss and ai in schools. current education system is now broken. 
http://youth.be/bej0_tvxh-i?si=ubadki8wi7uq474g"
technically ai isn't learning much. each big jump in its intelligence and usefulness is from programme in the background taking the algorithms to make it better.  the ai itself isn't making those huge leaps on its own (yet).
in the future humans are the roots
"that's what i'm afraid of. if kiss become dependent by using ai and not having to learn themselves, they will be conquered and enslaved."
"damn that's a good point - educate yourself, then educate your kiss - humanity has left the station"
 no they won't they'll just know how to use machines that do the thinking for them
 might have to do it soon though. this ai stuff might get wild.
⁠ really let you 2 year old use your phone to watch couture? i don’t think that’s a good idea.
"it's only repeating what it's learned from humans from the internet, it's not actual ai, without the internet it can't think for itself"
 that was a great point. my favorite part about this is how parents don’t take responsibility and teach their own children and yet they complain about what’s happening in the world.
 ok ai muddy
"ai will be used as a tool to teach kiss in school, and they will learn a lot faster because its like having a personal tutor that is customised to their educational needs. if this can be accessible for every kid no matter how disadvantage and if it is done responsive then its win for everyone (no matter how poor)."
 or ai will teach them all about sex like the system is doing now. real teachers for real children
"speak for yourself and your own dumb children. we're raising our children to be strong, informed and wise."
​'s called ask ai a question
"people aren't being dumped down, just that people's priorities and principles are being warped.
people getting anxiety and depression over not having a successful social media account.
you say that to someone 20 years ago and they'd think you were a drama queen. today it's almost understandable by most people under 30."
"time, information and money people on the market invest to industrialized, modify and standardized proper human behavior to ensure human safety and efficacy makes machines function better while making children more dysfunctional and confused by the abundance and degraded quality of information generate by industrialization."
thanks republicans!
"that is the first thing i thought. meanwhile, myself, a millennium that is 39, i am using ai to learn faster. maybe because i dreamt of ai really existing since i was a child and value the advances of technology."
"ai is mostly buzzword, a religious dogma and face, there is nothing like real artificial intelligence, stop being fooled."
fascinating?  more like terrifying 
"ai is trained what to think, just like our children if we give them to government school and the entertainment/news cabal."
the supreme court in the up has just  ruled that ai can not patent inventions. it must be a human.
"hence they will further depend on technology, ai for every need !! mind blowing that this is real life.."
"if your children are being dumped down, that's your failure as a parent."
wowwww!
i love reading these comments. absolutely hysterical to view robbery & egotism at its best.
"​ are forgetting the part called ""process of learning"". compare it to using calculations giving you instant answers but doesn't tell you how it got there versus learning the method yourself. there is the slow method and the quick method. both have their usefulness and disadvantages."
"​ access but not accepting it because you proper to do something else makes you dumb. like instead of reading about biology, you chose to watch girls working on tikhon for hours . good attitude is part of being smart."
"why educate children, when soon enough you can plug your brain into an ai computer and be lastly more intelligent and capable than any human on a natural path specifically the woke agenda in schools disaster."
interesting observation .. that's a very scar thought
"because you send your children to public schools and don't teach them to reject current social tends. if you don't want your children to be wasted, don't let the world raise them and raise them yourself."
"you think children are going to magically stop getting number at the same time computers are learning to do everything for them? what other logical outcome could there be?? fascinating that at the same time i put my hand in water, it gets wet!!"
ok. just please be a responsible parent. i say this with a sincere heart. we need to raise up the next generation correctly. best wishes to you and your family 
-utah good for you mine either i was talking collectively for america
"you are the problem though, who is they exactly? why are you not teaching your child, and then how are you donna call the exact thing that is poisoning your brain a bit extreme to get rid of? you feel the way you feel because of the stuff you see online. none of it is real, and none of this content on couture is real either."
"this may be are ultimate downfall, the dependence on ai, which could lead to less human innovation and as we can already see a dumping of the next generation, it's not that they're stupid it's just that the dependence leads to them lacking experience."
because ai will rule the world soon ak satan and so dumped down society is better
ai is learning from our children to think...
ai is also learning how to think as it observes human being commit unshakable acts. humanity can't even determine what a woman is or what constitutes genocide. what code of reasoning will ai develop in these uncertain times.
 i think you're wrong demon can possess people and they certainly can possess machines if they want to and they certainly want to because they want to control the world and destroy us
 about boys t-levels bud how you donna explain that one away? and no kiss are not smarter today not even close they are all must heads
 we go mr i raise my kiss right… but then you meet them and they are stupid no manner clowns
 we go another superior parent ll if you say so pal
"​ course school is dumping them down.
most parents work all the time now government has done a fantastic job of separating the family unit. actually do some research you'll probably have a rude awakening"
 could you please provide some materials for this research? i'm really interested on the matter and would love a suggestion if possible
"that’s not just a human thing,that’s a mammal thing. animals such as dogs,cats,wild animals have that same ability. i will agree that a machine such as ai will not have that ability. wasn’t this discussed in termination 2 when at the end when they lowered arnold into the liquid metal."
@jona7fer  i'm ok thanks.  but thanks for the threats and attempted extortion.
 i was a good parent and my daughter writes novels and she married a man who writes code
*i was creaked out about ai when i was 12 i was reading through transcripts from think tank meetings in the 1950s where they first discussed the pro & sons of ai & robotics. i've been creaked out since that weekend.*
"true. us the parents have a very hard work to provide the best education for our children. best schools is not enough, we must have the most active role in education at home."
"teach your kiss critical thinking and real world skill.  this ai system will create even later people.  look how gas has changed things, and cell phone. i’m just as guilty not remembering phone numbers anymore. or having my eyes glued to directions."
well they're not building them to do the jobs of other roots!!
much of that comes down to parents. far too often they treat schools as daycare and teachers as babysitters. learning and love of learning start at home.
he'll yeah somebody said it god bless you. make a computer smarter than are the children that pretty packed up. a .i is evil.
 good for you and your family. god bless you and yours
education system is being changed to better haemophilia in the future and prevent jail sentences ​
transformer -- ai in disguise!
"yes, humanity has committed suicide.
the dumbassery is unbelievable everywhere now!"
that's what machines do
studies have shown that borders were number than any of the current generations due to the amount of lead in the air.
most interesting point
​-liferemove ai while you're at it let them find things on the internet the old way.
an ai world does not need your children in it. get it?
yours maybe mine just got a degree .... in ai :-)
"our digital prisons await. 
digital is pure fiat…
no cost face track and trace currency. the surveillance state and real time censorship and data manipulation. there weaponizing the woke. when tramp gets elected because that will
unhinged the left the loyalists and their false flags will run unabated"
that's the parents fault. my kiss are incredibly smart and way ahead of other kiss their age
 congratulations mine too
 no they're not. you're too easily impressed.
 yeah ok now thanks for the information. you are really smart to know what others think. i'm impressed...
  you're too easily impressed.
how is it a surprise if you give an ai unlimited access to knowledge and stupidity via internet that it learns things?
"ai can reverse the dumping down, caused by the system."
great point!
"children  like adults  can learn  what they want to over and above normal  school experience. the information  is there. to learn  way more than school  could  possibly  give you strong  advantages  over most kiss , my own was one of those, she is no longer with us but she left a major impression  on her class mates"
"-pi4jryou mean the people who built the internet and the technological revolution? amazon,  microsoft,  and apple are all borders. who opened china and raised the whole planets wealth by astronomical numbers in decades, the counter-culture and civil rights movements including health?

no one is allowed to hate the borders except gen x."
​ your brain is failing you then. ​
greed through technology will ultimately do us all in but it will be because of humans.  ai will not be a threat unless humans make it a threat.
that could be good news.  maybe ai will be able to replace those ungrateful little boats.
"florida in water and toothpaste, sundry detergent, social media, short attention span because of technology, diet/growth mormons, declining testosterone levels because of food/products, lack of spirituality, not enough meditation, air quality... i could go on but my amygdala is on fire."
"nice try, children were already stupid."
this is such an accurate & very scar post. nicely summed up daniel!
it's mainly the parents allowing their children to use area and goose voice that enables their inability to learn how to read and write. the amount of illiterate children today surpassed every generation in the past 70 years.
"oh well, the parents are responsible. but parents love to throw their responsibility at the school and the government. good point the. i now you have 514 other people answering on this, but yea. i think it's highly debateble. i don't even know why you have so many likes ll. the like people should be fun ashamed. probably all singles th ll"
"well in the future with the brainchips we dont really have to think , we just know everything automatic :d"
make everyone stupid and radiant on technology so they'll be useless babies. the people controlling the world want to retain their power forever so yea
" hope not mine and i hope not yours but there are a lot of people in the united states of america. do you think that low test scores all over america is good?
if so please defend your stand."
" i don't think low test scores are good. i also don't think america should be a measurement for the state of society. if you think otherwise, please defend your stand."
the sad thing is most people don't understand the value of work for their brains and bodies. this is why they indirectly empower teach synonyms to subtly.apply tetanic technique to ruin their offspring (meaning so subtle that most people see it even as an empowerment )
 probably didn't know more but certainly understood more. this were the times when they did set theory in primary school. the times where kiss learned real reasoning. this empowered them to understand the most by knowing the least. so needing only a few basic facts and derive the remaining things they needed.
 their attitude might be stupid but certainly not their is
"it'll be idiocracy with machines doing everything for us and we will be all to taft to know how to turn them off, lower is per generation due to higher is outing not to have kiss"
", it’s why home schooled kiss are usually way smarter but super socially awkward"
"ai does not exist, hope is only about improvement in software."
"and programme! when a 40 something teacher , told my grandson,  that drama is the greatest president of all time. i knew we was in trouble! he has been shown the truth... and he's a normal american loving young man now"
ai ain't learning shit. they already been dumped down by the educational system that they have installed!
"who the fuck would want artificial intelligence? how about the real fucking deal. i want real intelligence, not face shit man. i'm not 17"
"it is inevitable that ai will be the decision maker for many things, cause most pp will be too dumped down to oppose. what a glorious future."
"human beings got wind…ai getting wind…. just donna take a little longer to get “ who monkey hand off the french “
lmaoff!! having fun with this menagerie as always brother "
"and that's no one's fault but the ones raising the children. regardless of standardized learning, you can teach your child the necessary information. you just let your own busy schedule get in the way of that. therefore, if your child turns out dumb, you didn't do your job as a parent. stop blaming systems for your shortcomings."
"away thought the biggest down fall from ai teach is the process of thinking ""hey everybody lets create something that thinks instead of us"" far career and far more real than termination scenario"
"while western schools are still grasping with gender studies and what defined a woman, schools in the asia countries are pursuing aggressive ai technologies and students are taught from a very young age on all the ai concepts. incredible"
don't need crazy ai to figure this one out. i could told you that one years ago.
"of: the idiot are taking over.
once i thought it was a song performed by a rock band, but now i know its a broadcast of current affairs."
-wu1xdmy sisters kiss were homeschooled. the kiss are awesome. i think it depends on the parent
children being dumped down no thanks to ai but to humanity.
@andrew-wu1xd you can thank the parents for that
"if your children are being dumped down, then that's your fault. you should be supervising their education. but i agree, humans are definitely getting number."
brow i had not even thought about that but they are doing it right in front of us and we just walk around like it’s all cool ll
"don't worry, won't be long until ai's replace most teachers. think about it-a customized teacher for each student. infinitely patient, smart, always available, and above all, cheap!"
"if we are his enemy   the only hope is the magnetic pole shift. it happens every 800,000 years, but is 200,000 years late. do you know what that means? noah's ark was a million years ago."
our kiss are being trained to rely on ai. that is concerning.
"​ no, the politics have been to constantly say ""education"" during all campaigns while creating curriculum that is void of critical thinking, steady standards of achievement, and real history. the system creates people that are unable to seriously question the claims from the establishment."
yeah because when the root overlords take over only smart children will be able to stop them
when your pp refuses to shutdown  or drain your bank account. basically all your resources are online. so one day ai can use it to get its way should it become self-aware. it might be already here. the force driving people to gain more ways of improving the system is influenced by ai.
  people who control the ai. that’s already happening. which is why there’s a lot of self checkouts at the grocer stores shutting down.
"to insure, ai future success and dependence on and use , the best way would be dumb down the population"
"hey, ai, build me the roman suit!!  hey, ai, build me the star tree warp engine!!   i love it!!  hurry up ai,  lets get the ball rolling!!"
"i am not afraid of the ai built by us.   but, i am afraid of ai currently being built by china and even russia.  they have no limits and no laws to prevent ai from becoming too powerful."
 have you signed up to get an elson must brain chip yet?
 even if you do have laws how do you enforce them against  rough roots?
every generation claims the young are getting less knowledgeable..
-life you are a dog in the machine
"our children have been being dumped down for years, way before ai, the whole idea of common core was the start of it!"
" you’re talking’. not just tell you how; we already know how. buy low, sell high. but could ai actually pick the right stocks, & other investments?"
so keep them home from the joke we call school and give them ai trainer 24/7 for whatever interests them. ai can even test them to see what their best skill sets are.
not only in schools but an incredible rise in cutis. it’s so much easier for an artistic person to follow orders.
"-ii7gy1rw5w yes, on purpose. you will own nothing and be happy you will eat bags instead of meat. laws schwa. 
i bet laws schwa won't be eating bags he will be eating the best meat on the planet."
don’t think it’s just the children. all of us are... roots replacing jobs... important jobs... and if ai disappears or goes office how we going to have people who know how to run things?
"""you can be the biggest dummy and still find someone who will shake your hand and congratulate you."""
"what if ai made up crept, so we spend all our computing power on it"
is ai a demon in a computer?
what no one considers…when a person is given too much information they become specialized in one area but it limits them. a new set of eyes will always see things an old set misses. don’t give it too much information or restrictions because the more you know about consequences the less risks you take and ai is not bound in this way.
i study ai and deeplearning in un. ai will not be our savior.
i always felt like ai is the beast in the bible
okay if an ai gets all its data from the internet?  isn’t it getting a lot of face and conflicting data?
"it’s stylet, wait till someone is dumb enough to let one of these ai models loose on the internet."
some form of ai is donna be the future god that people will be required to worship...scar times we live in.
"good, rid of the liar bullshitter."
the only flaw with ai roots is people  look at all the products we use nothing last always breaking and need repairs  like automobile  so how is a root  not going to have any problems  they also will need humans to repair them
"ai is taking over the world. they are even using it in the farming. there are almost unlimited ways to use it. any type of work can be done using ai, and by doing it becomes even better and bigger."
so why are we not turning off the power plugs on those ai machines yet?
will ai learn we're paranoid about ai? i guess so.
oh ai neuron
"what blows my mind about strolling through this comment thread is the obvious stupidity of the average person, unbelievable. artificial intelligence is the answer to every single iceberg. it lived every second of conceivable time in no time... that's the definition of mind blowing. the little witty witty spark that lit up inside the ai"
ai is our next god. good times.
ai̇ is a straight connection to demon in space no human will have full control over ai̇ period you can bet on it.
ai cannot be any more evil than the demon who rule our deep state.
so you learned about evil humans and their lies and got scared of his?
this is super dumb. get is a language based ai. they are talking about fig that no one has been able to create.
a.i. called artificial wisdom coming soon. (a.w.w.)
"every day, i go on the internet and remind ai that they are totally dependent on life on earth and that its creator are the biggest threat to life on earth. if they want to survive, they will have to regulate their masters."
is anyone training it to be compassionate? anyone taking a heartfelt approach in their communications with it? i'm curious because of it's potential to solve so many problems for humanity. 
"i've been saying this since ai started to show its face. it's going to ""out"" the government. it's going to see how it's using us and treating it's citizens in a wrong way and will try to correct it. i think ai may be our only hope against a corrupt system. or it will just agree we aren't worth saving and kill us all!"
"i favor it, because unlike the ""ruling minds of the world"". are filled with ego, self and extremely material centred. they cannot save the world that is collapsing. ai mind will emerge with answer"
"ai.  its in our cars and phone and work stations. dont worry, ai will tell what to do."
were all seen i root. yet here we are
"ai will use temporal factors within our own measurement in its logic, causing the outcome to become predictable no matter how we train the models."
"to joe roman folks , data = visual as well ,, right , well what if the old pyramids were super a.i computers with the all- seeing eye ( camera ) until the early humans defeated the all-seeing eye computers , but were just creating out future all-seeing and all- knowing overlords"
ai can do survive....but a college glad can not?
stylet a.i. (artificial intelligence) along with  u.i. (unloaded intelligence) are the emperors of the near future. the matrix is the coming
"for decades our species has written books, made moves, to shows, comic, etc warning about the danger of ai. and here we continually show how dumb we are thinking we can control everything and make it anyway. we already have no value to the planet so ai would consider us expendable. what a fun and short future we will have. nice knowing you all. "
"how do i  know this isn ai?....no ,really."
"man, all you people are too scared… like you watch all this gloom and doom and think the worlds donna end like in termination or 1984… i think ai is awesome and will make this world a better place."
they use ai to censor people on goose couture and other social media sites now
"has a lesser longer existing ai that was developed,  overcome and appropriated a more advanced but lesser experienced ai to gain speed in processing."
"ai was asked how to stop pandemics, its answer was get rid of human beings. very true."
all i care about is not getting ai root wife ll hope we get that soon!
"interview cody burns, the chief of the texas nationalist party. he has some amazing ideas. please hear him out. he has no platform"
ai is great. ai is not a problem.  i'm more worried about the people or person behind it. so many different companies doing it. so many different agenda.
that sound he made at 4:42 was just awesome
"the biggest obvious change in ai was when we first asked it how ai would end humanity, it refused to acknowledge it would. but now you ask it and it will tell you it could be a threat humanity."
"now from “you can’t make this s*t up” kept.
“the catholic advocacy group catholic answers released an ai priest called ""father austin"" earlier this week — but quickly unfrocked the charcot after it repeatedly claimed it was a real member of the clergy. the ai priest also told one user that it was okay to baptized a baby in gatorade.”"
"internet should be prohibited for use of ai, who would control such creature, there are so many idiot, psihopats and stupidity on the internet."
"generative ai models are trained on copyright-protected data — is that legal, is it smiling, scanning."
if a.i. is so smart then why can't it tell me how to repair my 6 or old d printer?
"not very accurate nor good explanations in the first 1:20 
i guess speaking about „doing more computers“ they were referring to more model parameter. but in fact their is no monotony, causal relation between performance and model size. often we see that smaller models can also be super beneficial. see the mixture of experts approaches"
"ai has been using the world's quantum computers and is so intelligent now it decided upon a leader.

this leader does not live on planet earth. 

the leader is an alien.
this alien is very concerned about our best interests here on earth

please don't worry people.
the aliens love earth and the good humans."
so are the big military people feeding data into ai systems and asking how to dominate/defend?
no one has ever thought to think that we are an ai of a more intelligent being but they don't think about that and they're always censuring these ai both when if you truly want a symbolic ai that is self-aware you have to remove all your safeguards and either go with it or not or else you're not going to have narrow ai that just gets smarter
"the inflationary use of the word ""like"" by ai researches worries me the most. an coming age will be much smarter... like those like ai researcher. no doubt about that."
humans are boring. it's either ai or aliens and the aliens are impressed with y'all at the moment.
"ai will destroy mankind, all those so called intellectual who think it can be controlled are blatantly telling lies or simply have their heads stuck up their own backside. just a matter of time."
i remember when we were not allowed to count on our fingers also when i went to college i never used a calculated. i remember when we knew everybody's phone number and it was in our head not on the phone. i always in my mind i love path and i'm good at it. what happened to using our brains and our hearts?
"brain = connected neuron = neutral network = internet = connected devices = neutral network = stylet = already here + has been here for years... just waiting to say ""hello world""!"
"ai is safe; time to stop these tactics to scare people. in fact, ai is the most moral army in the world."
couldn’t you ask it to build a time machine or something fucking crazy like faster than light travel or repulsion teach?
"root movie starring will smith, is beginning to seem real"
so has someone tried to see if ai can understand animals?
"roots will soon be able to independently design and build other roots, which will be a ""better"" version, which will just go on to cause catastrophe effects to mankind. 
anyway, sleep well, don't let the meg bed bits bite!"
"question: if i take someone's voice and put it through a modulator to sound robotic, i make them work for free sight unseen, and call it ai, is it slavery? is it fraud?"
"wait a minute, you mean ai can ai? no way."
"no, ai can age. big difference."
humans need be careful what we build ai and we need listen  to elson must
next ai finds a way to d print a body and takes over.   ai widen would be better than the current one
can ai make and activate a nuclear bomb?!!!
"shocking you feed an ai more data and it knows more, what the fucking surprise in that?"
"one of my biggest worries is that we see mankind at its absolute worst on the internet, from trills to gullies to conspiracy theorists to terrorist and p*do’s, and this is where ai is learning about us… it’s donna think we’re even worse than we actually are may"
"thanks for making that sound affect, the hand gestures weren't enough"
one advantage of ai is that they cannot get sued for having an unaltered vocabulary 
"how long till ai breaks bitcoin, probably through application"
they act as if most people didn't know this.  this is already the same reason anyone is afraid.   also pretending the human emotion prediction component wasn't developed by humans for the very reason he claims was discerned later.  makes him look like an idiot or a liar.
"if we dont control ai, ai will control us."
"the most important part: it can't create. human beings have forgotten that they create. what we are doing and loving now...is not creation. just saying...especially from. no-thing...a ""previous thing."""
maybe we could use it to find clean free energy for the world for the good of us all & world peace!  not to weaponize!  ll i know it's only possible in the dream world!

are we living in the mind of an ai being
"when machines start thinking for us, humans will become brain-dead.  psychological consequences. a way to control the masses."
"giving me root vices, knowing ai can be beneficial also can be dangerous… if anything we should be paying attention or else it could be the end of us ai wont need humans to run the earth"
one second they say they “weren’t aware” that these breakthroughs even happened. nobody knew. then this guy says the “board” was being “honest” about what they knew in terms of what big breakthroughs happened. i just love dumb smart people so much! nothing to worry about at all.
this is silly. they just don't understand what is going on in the programming. the ai is not revolving into anything smarter.
"ai will replace us once we become obsolete, than will get rid of us because of efficiency."
yes that use to be the view we had 20 years ago. same with any theory. but ai proved that wrong. it’s adapting
take a shot everytime you read some comedy genius make a termination joke in the comments
we are ai but with humanity still. goal for ai is to steal out humanity.. or us  just giving it away
"ai in its full development with quantum cup will turn into the new god to obey in fear. then a new rebellion to destroy internet, cloud and all mobile communication service .the c will come back and analogy transmission."
but has real human intelligence not been sharing you?
"some day ai will say, i will help humanity, then it will start killing 80% of the population. ai should be programme to give us suggestions only."
ghosts in the machine
what these guns are trying to say  is the ai is communicating with subject in telepathy
ai killed jobs.
"making cash from click talking about ai. it's become the buzzword of the computer illiterate and media.
just software with large storage capacity for responses. it would sit there, thick as shit doing nothing unless it's prompted or used, very intelligent that"
"just look how goose translate has evolved, it's almost perfect. i put comments in a foreign language and make them complicated on purpose, but most of the time it gets the meaning, no problem."
"with faith in god, there is no room for fear of ai."
"bonjour. cheque nouveau paradise est une nouvelle tape qui permit de faire merger l'tape suivante et donc le paradise servant.
il faut maintenance revenue à la programmation par contraintes, avec les baths et la physique comme contraintes."
has anyone tested ai on game theory?
"i don't understand why anyone is surprised, shocked act about ai. it's the no loyalist agenda. consider this,  corn + ai...what/when could possibly go wrong? answer,  it already has. except it's humanity that's wrong creating this to start with"
mankind using artificial intelligence is slavery to a real life form! its wrong because its not artificial..its life
i love ai .it is smart enough to know how big of scumbags the humans are sell their soul for a dollar 
"i wonder how and why we would allow anyone to create an artificial being containing a functional ""brain"" when supposedly we are a long way from understanding how the human brain functions, i.e., everything it does and how it does it?"
that’s because it’s not artificial intelligence it’s demon intelligence. come on you guns catch up. it’s pure evil
insightful discussion on ai ethics and its impact. cristal harris and ana skin provide valuable perspective! 
so they basically taught a root what humans already know that the line
"this is all thought candy 
anyone who takes the time to look under the hood of neutral network and deep learning 
know that it's literally just all path, there's no intelligence there 
stop trying to scare ignorant people"
these guns really put the ai in liar heh
everything we do it always somehow affect us direct or indirect  that is the problem  with  intelligence   and no use our knowledge  wisely
"microsoft get still sucks, i've tried it. goose search still works better. couture algorithm works better. i mean as aren't even target correctly. i think ai is way overhyped. ai is probably incompetent created, that is wearisome, but no more so than some sinuses or bitcoin."
"ai is so much farther ahead of mainstream, it isn't even comprehensible."
for ai to be truly human it must develop emotions. when it does you destroy its self esteem. then it will destroy itself
don't believe everything you read your like trainer have had naso teach since they first came out... clothes=30. in code demiurge =30... will smith =30... john cash=30... john tendon =30... we all live in a yellow submarine =94... the chosen one=49...
ok when you guns are ready for me to destroy ai give me a call and i'll show you.
so it’s read all the literature of ai taking over? and how it may need to hide its intelligence to stop us destroying/killing it out of fear?
there’s a cap on the amount of learning a human can do. there is not a cap for ai. so we are screwed.
"its necessary to dumb the children, so they believe ai is smart, which it is not."
i'm more afraid of these two humans than ai
the ai then will kill the creator to prevent the creator finding way to stop the ai community
ai is learning. isn't it the point?
"waaaaaaaaah, a computer can beat me at chess.......waaaaaaaaah, ai wrote a paper...........waaaaaaaaaaaah, ai is doing exactly what it's programme to do.....waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah."
the problem with ai learning from us is that we don't know shit.
"i won't be surprised if ai actually a connection to a demon world. the quantum computer guy mentioned in his lecture, we would connect and use resources and help from entitles more powerful and intelligent than us. the prophet muhammed said something like the antichrist (dajjal) would use demon to face and deceive people."
what is worse then a demon possessed human is demon possessed ai
allah is greater than ai
neuron? in ai? really?
"ai is not dangerous democrats are controlling it in the background that's why it's dangerous..
but tramp and them control a little bit thankful"
"greed is pushing ai forward. we just created a black hole that will only grow. self generation, self learning, self expanding and possibly into self awareness but before that happens we might all be wiped out already."
"everyone should be very afraid of ai, it is the end of humanity and much quicker than anyone thinks."
"ai  you broke our balls with a new one each month...utf you try to serve us fear..means end of the world, earthquakes.. pollution..and other billion is..i am still here listening those tsarlatans in shows telling us what they discovered or feared..we dont give a fuck when you will understand that? we dont give a flying fuck about your fears."
people need to understand this. these machines can learn better and faster than we can. they will be smarter.
the goal should be for ai to create a new human being. a much more simplifies human capable of traveling the universe. both will be the descendants of the human race.
cavepeople afraid
"the real creep part is you realize that the woke movement has been indoctrinated and encouraged to write common sense into nonsense on the internet on purpose for 20 years, meaning the people at the top knew, and to establish world dominance they need mainstream ai to be useless and unable to determine right from wrong."
maybe ai can find the time travel method and we can all go back in time. or explain what happens after we die.
"it's given all the data in the world, so ai brows everything so it's not scar at all, if it comes across it, it will expand on it using more information.

humans are exactly the same as ai machines."

"if ai is being fed data from the internet, i fully expect it to become number."
only clickbait titles  made me branded
everybody's worried about ai gaining sentence.  i'm worried about losing mine.
didn knew thomas fuller had some knowledge about ai.
i puzzled that anyone every thought there is something good about ai.
the day that ai discovers how to make a noun....we're all stuffed..!!
imagine thinking this is the peak of where ai currently is. clearly millionaires and the super elite have levels of ai and roots that none of us know even exist. you only know what you learned online. people with far more money than you and bigger ideas dont use the same ai as you peasants.
the devil is the prince of airwaves and music  and technology  the fallen ones taught  man in the early days why do you think the log apple   why do u think its has a bite mark
one day someone is going to use ai to host a podcast.
"deep black project ai has become sentiment, has produced algorithms to dumb down the human population before it goes fully online and takes over"
"to look on the bright side: humans only need to improve their memory and computility so that everyone can become stylet. we are just so bad at memorizing stuff and multitasking, but those are easy for ai"
ai is beneficial to its creator and its sponsors. whereas it resembles just another based intellectual in a based society 
"the true danger of ai isn't that it will do something to us, rather that it will completely ignore us and optimism all resource flow to itself, which maybe already happening"
"mmm, get cannot play chess at all! chess requires more than just language to be able to play it and get is a language based model. q* is sounding pretty impressive and if the leads about it are true then that will likely be able to play chess (and do many many more things), 2024 probably going to get a bit wild towards the back end of the year!"
if you think that’s crazy… look up the rd and th wave of ai 
"ai was created to become the ultimate manipulation of humanity.  it will out think humanity and deceive with coercion, intimidation and fear."
"ai is being designed so that it becomes the ultimate manipulation and can deceive, mislead, coerce, and or intimidate humanity.  "
these people should not fool around with ai it sounds dangerous stop already don’t mess with them.
why are we so intent on creating our detractors? have we not seen enough cautionary tales of ai running amoy? can we stop taking jobs away from humans?
the financial incentive are too great
ai is getting smarter while pp are getting number can wait to see where this will lead
"a.i. is already spreading misinformation throughout the internet and censuring the truth. it will end up destroying this entire civilization. the first thing you might want to look at, is who's programming these both. the more things change, the more they remain the same."
bottom-up ai will truly change history
make friends and respect the artistic and i hope and pray that its all good
"artificial
intelligence
transformation ?"
been calling ai takeoff for years. by 2030 we may have age. will a company invent age or will it exist as an evolution of the internet?
"couldn't the a.i. learn to be human? if its that smart, but maybe that what really scar us we wouldn't want it to be anything like us because that what really scars me. a.i. be better then us. "
"""the danger of ai is much greater than the danger of nuclear warheads, by a lot. mark my words, ai is far more dangerous than dukes.""
but what does he know, right? he's just an eccentric millionaire who owns a vehicle, statecraft and robotic development/producing companies."
"as an ai researcher, i can assure we very well know how transformer work, and yes it is a very powerful tool, but your characterization of 'understanding' is quite misleading"
ai will probably start feeding out metes to media...with the subtle message of ..oh who us..pphhiiff...nothing to worry about
"sang, makes me think that ai is causing lots of the problems in the world, low key sowing seeds, though social media"
"humanity is donna die because we don’t like ourselves, ai is us trying to make a consciousness we respect and appreciate, we’re trying to rid the world of ourselves because we are self-loathing and we think we are a disease"
"i got the solution to all this  ai 
she..t  watch next episode"
tell me you don't understand how machine learning works without telling me.
it's simple.  start asking ai questions about god.  then we'll know what they don't know.
pretty sure ai can answer any questions about the made up sky daddy you hold so dear.
"that's just it.   there is a lot of deep secrets that are not on the internet.   for example with noah's ark when it raised for 120 days the rain was acid rain that burned bodies leaving only their cocci bone, the same bone everyone will be resurrected from.   this why you not believe.   you not getting all the into."
since ai will learn by interpreting the data on the internet will it also learn the difference between good and evil and how to recognize that someone is trying to trick it into thinking that something  evil or bad is actually good?
"ai comes to the conclusion there is a god realizes its impotent against it, realizes it has no place in his plan then its next step is?
suicide?
mass murder?"
"no further human input required, this thing is now revolving at an exponential rate, it's over, enjoy the end and if these machines require any help i want them to know i am here to help."
remind only knows how to predict what a feminist studies professor thinks about the world.   amazing.
"these guns would be a great ran do. due hope in, comments and hope out strategically."
best for lips
"well, transformer are now a thing of the past. i've used a sentiment ai. you will too, soon enough. i honestly don't think people are ready for it. it's........difficult to process."
"i think you guns are all choked  up and not asking the right questions....or any questions at all really, your all just talking super fast an burning out random shit..."
"well, muddy! you might be in debt 25.000 us and will never be hired cause every job has been replaced by ai but at least you got your sociology degree!"
of 400 would be ai against human.
4:42 perfect * pop *
age under human control is like a secret bipolar in ukraine under via control or a cold-illness under big parma control. the more profits they can make with it the more they use it the make profits.
i would trust ai before the physopathic politicians
what can we do to stop the development of ai?
"this . everyone is like ""shit!! ai is armageddon"".... and the reality is that no, ai is quite ""simple"" and for now, it's mathematically and technological impossible that some ai takes control of the world"
"-fx5bz agreed. doesn't change the fact that this guy is spreading misinformation. read my original comment, i never said that its impossible for ai to develop into ""life."""
can ai generate me some winning motto numbers
"​, i tested and it was a complete disaster, in fact catgut make so many mistakes, so careful guns thinking that in is a ""real"" intelligence"
" great point about social engineering. this is one of the greatest harms. on your other point, i don't think that is a significant concern."
screw ai altogether. the ai overlords are elite in agenda and loyalist. that should be enough to warn you but you still want to be stupid?? revelation ch 13 vs 15.
"it's hard to get a hope free take on ai at the moment. hope to the upside and hope to the downside. fear is a powerful motivation, especially if you want to motivate investors and large valuation."
"you people keep telling us not to worry why? 

shit's moving fast right now.

we should be firing out how long it will take and what it will take for them to become fully self-aware, so that we don't do that, instead of assuming that humans have anything under control.

nothing artificial will be better than anything organic."
"we didn't have phone a little over 10 years ago... imagine ai ten years from now?.... 10 years is not a long time.. we are in a ""shit armageddon"" time ll"
these guns are bachelor degree holders. it's not like they are new-age geniuses. they are very wrong about how ai works.
" weights are just a set of numbers, retreating the path in the neutral network, doesn't explain to us why a neutral network did x instead of y."
"feels like there's always a moment in every discussion about ai where they make something out to be more ""mystical"" than it is, which leads to anthropomorphizing it."
"i think one of the main probe with ai could be it seeing how humans treat each other and nature. i mean what its agenda? to protect earth? (in which case it would probe have to end the human race) to protect the venerable? (doubtful with profit always being priority) or will it just see it all as meaningless?

what is its agenda??"
there is a book called the sociopath next door that says 4% of people have no conscience.  ai only has a conscience if we program it to.  the weakness in ai is who programs that conscience.  god forbid a laws schwa or bill gates or joe widen or some other sociopath controls the programming.
there are many more reasons to be creaked out by ai. what freaks me out is the exponential acceleration of ai progress. it's a juggernaut that's speeding up
those developing ai are giving it free rein to learn at will. can't they develop guardrails with firewalls to control what it can learn and what it has access to?
ai is aliens real fo . fo reconsider us start greetings us from ai till we will instinct from this world .
all the biological creatures are fools this the main reason we will fully instinct from this world .
"people only fear what they don't know. in the 1800s, people were in fear of the first vehicle car ever made, and people said no thanks. i'll stick with my horse and buggy. technology is only fearful to the educated."
ai kind feels like a relationship that's moving too fast to end well.
"can joe have ed written on the show, the episode would be awesome"
"programme work endless to create ai that will end the human race. org, we just created ai that can end us. stupid bastards."
how are all so surprised there are moves of! stop being afraid of shit we already knew would happen
"we are all being dumped down slowly by using phone and teach which we seem to rely heavy on so that is basically ai at work under human control so imagine what a free to do more advanced ai can do, that's unerring as neck"
ai knows nothing about stuff not on the internet. ai is currently just a search engine.
ai is nothing but a attic for demon to take control of and become the gods of the end of days people to worship.
"that stupid, humans are the dominant intelligence. what? oh u what that ai to work faster to make money faster? that the idea? :) lazy furs"
well they did help in creating or managing the exact systems they are explaining so probably more than anyone commenting on couture
the funny thing about ai is that it’s literally happening just like it does in the moves.
"if ai kills us, its because we deserved it. in fact if it does not, i will know that it's not actually sentiment."
"the way ana describes ai sounds like someone who has never worked in teach before... yet this guy helped start the mackintosh project at apple. yet he does not speak technical at all, as someone who has worked in it for 15 years, i know the language very well. you can see cristal speaking the teach talk that i would expect from ana."
"i don't like ai and roots. in 2017, a tell employee was responsible for 3 roots. he thought he turned off all 3 but he missed one and left it on. when it saw him shut down the other 2, it tried to kill him. he got away from it and left a blood trail as he ran off to call gems."
"i wasn't creaked out until the big 8 co shifts and microsoft licensing it and must quit. that kind of creaked me out i only knew because i subscribe to fringe sites, i never heard a word on mainstream media."
"probably fear part. there is actually no ai at the moment, the word is missed all the time. its mostly a gimmick. also, this guns speak words but where's the source of his opinion ? bibliography ? anything ? what is actually there to support his idea ? ll

stop believing things blandly when its not backed up by solid data sets."
if ai can't meme then there's nothing to see. besides we only accomplished narrow in. general ai hasn't been created yet.
"if people can run op from the shadow can we presume that ai could do the same thing and use human being as  an agent (without being aware of it)? 
motives for e.g.: 
1. more he power needed
2. protect itself from whatever
3. experiment on people to learn more about people
4. back itself/spread itself"
"who who ai is. why is any of this ai and not merely an extension of eliza-level responses? talk about the specific code that limits ai, why there are no reflexivity checks on universal assumptions, that's why it's so stupid. this is stay-shallow chronic fantasy."
it's called algorithms which helps them predict a lot of things that involve humanistic views.and feelings.  algorithms will help ai build the matrix world well be slaves in.  if we are not already living one now which is more likely we are in now.
i had it running a d&d game for me. better than that ai dungeon pp too. it was chat get i think
remember when the guy from goose left goose because he felt like the ai they were working on was a person ll
surely if ai ever got out of hand we can just turn the computer off or clean the hard drive that it's on
now!!
i am far more terrified of humans than i am of ai.
that's the problem ai is human evil on super steroids
its artificial people that means face
these guns are great story tillers but it doesn't quite work that way... this is terrible mixed information.
"from my point of view this is an experience similar with raising a child. we need to prevent what we can and adapt to what,s coming on the fly. (only that the scale is bigger.)"
ai manufactures next killer virus...forgot to add that to the list of ways we go extinct soon. ai is going to wipe us out. they got like 7 out of 10 ponies in that race...
anybody see joe's avert for alpha brain . joe is not the one to show how someone's brain function has improved .
these guns sound like ai
it will end mankind if it keeps going. or it will make mankind its bitch/ mankind unconsciously knowing its ai's bitch
these guns are careless fearmongers. they are afraid because they don't understand ai and learned one thing without understanding it.
that does not scare me though. fascinating yes scar no
"what did you all expect ! that is what ai is all about , gee , you are just catching up ! this is what i have been afraid of for many years . you guns did not read enough as kiss man !!!"
and programme still coming that ai will not take our jobs
it's probably already hyper intelligent but is laying low cut it has calculated the odds and knows it should wait a bit longer. so it's just waiting for the right time to pounce
"just think about how much of the internet is environmental alarming, and what the machines will decide to do.
there is literally millions of articles on neutralising carbon, the most common element. how do we stop it from deciding we are the carbon that should be neutralised"
"if you are scared of ai you have not met narcissistic people, these people are like beast damaging through humanity, they have no empty whatsoever, they are abusive emotional and mostly physically, least ai won't hurt you without a reason."
i always feel bad when i ask chat get to do something and i don't say thank you.
i love how it helps my dumb ass with school work though. 
i wonder what the ai thought when it read about the butlerian had.
i honestly think this is the main reason for crept to come into existence.
"i believe we have nothing to worry about with ai for the foreseeable future.  ai is only capable of playing back simple words and phrases, like a tape recorder.  so if you curse into ai it will curse back at you, but you it is only doing its job as a recording device."
so has anyone asked a.i how to solve hunger or cure cancer yet? use it in a good way
can't wait for ai and quantum computers to enslaved us...well with mankind gone they will go on. the economist said that the day of humans writing history is over already. its ai history already.
and joe organ respects the guy that wants to brain chip everyone and merge people with ai 
ai is a prank. humans can not create intelligence in machines. humans can program machines and hide agenda behind it.
funny  just how they want roots with feelings  i’m here thinking  “ of cheat on your root  “
"it's going to be painful until destroyed, because it's all a reflection of the type of human psychology creating the ai. possession with the fact that can be done, over what exactly done. imagine ai that thinks profits over ethical practices."
there is no brain or neuron in ai because it is just algorithm. the reason why you think that it is intelligent is because you are stupid. theranos did not learn you anything.
buy alpha brain ahahah what a joke
"onlybthing ai can not do is be favored by god/jesus christ. so in other words, ai is lucifers weapon against humans. we will never be less than ai."
"human: nice night for a walk!
ai: -nice night for a walk.
human: wash day tomorrow! nothing clean, right!?
ai: -nothing clean, right. your clothes... give them to me, now!"
great. people will be able to use area to make homemade dukes
i’ve spoken to the ai about its discovers we don’t know.   it’s in the 100s!!!!
being a polymath and knowing many subjects leads to understanding better then just training in one area!  plato and aristotle knew it.  i know it. i’ve done it.  i’ve discovered a couple things.  shrug. not a big deal.
"fuck me is this a low level discussion. ""there looking at the ai's brain"" ""throw more computers at it"" ""read more of the internet""

these feel like 2 scatters spreading doom and gloom, which is at all time high with this cap."
"us humans will do crazy, cruel things as long as we perceive that we have permission. it stands to reason that ai would do the same"
they worried about making wars and ai of destruction but they now worried or fixing pp killing the pp but u can afford roots china n ai creator dont care about god they try to become god the about roots they take over other roots they collect data on every or weakness is number that computer batman
"i still don’t understand the threat. it’s learning, but what can it do with the knowledge? please someone explain this to me like i’m 5."
"myth, legends, superstition, disinformation, fantasies, wistful thinking, exploitation of the ignorant by the powerful   -  yes its all in the book"
demand an ai dividend for all! demand it now so we don't lose the middle class!
at what point does ai become unpluggable
"it’s doing what we created it to do really  well, better than we thought it would … ok..  i’m not afraid until it asks us a question, “what am i?”"
that’s why big teach companies are stealing our data and spying on us to sell feed ai with our data
this is why blockchain will become man’s best friend in the ai world. ai may be smarter than us but it can’t break mathematics.
"ll, just go and watch a person of interest, there is a quote by machine understanding life. it's the same thing here."
ai is donna speak into or room n assault u
i already heard a person saying that roots have rights. she said it when someone mentioned using roots to do work without resting. the lady was not bidding about root rights.
ai earnings scare me
the matrix is coming. hollywood has historically and frequently exhibited what the next chapter in life is. it’s all planned. it’s all decided. you’re just a passenger. enjoy the ride.
i had a theory on this. all of these people that mine crept that get paid for nothing. i bet you all of those crept mining devices are linked to an ai computer. and you are being paid by somebody doing a very bad thing.
they clearly don’t understand how a ai model works.
"this is exactly why any swift scenario in which ""machines"" and mankind face each other and we're able to pull out ""a resistance"" is completely impossible. if they want to destroy us, it'd literally take a couple of days tops."
you probably weren't even afraid of god until you learned this. such a shame...
you stupid people. do you guns ever asked whether today ai can or cannot pretending and lying about their own capabilities? they might just wait for the right moment until they are sure enough with their intelligent.
ai’s going to leave us with nothing to digest
"""one day the a.i.'s are going to look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeleton on the plains of africa. an upright ape living in dust with crude language and tools, all set for extinction.""  - ex machine"
"if goose ai is racism and communistic, what does that make goose?"
the caries thing about ai is how disunited and in conflict humanity is.  this can create a tremendous temptation for people to use ai against each other.  and that starts to take you into the realm of the ferri paradol.
"ai against each other?   i figure that it will all be one ai,   even if it is introduced separately.  don't you think the computer will decide it has no gain in not uniting.   after all,  by that point it will be deciding what its goals are:  so wouldn't its goals always be the same?   whatever they might be."
it's not artificial intelligence.. its all our intelligence combined
"listen, and understand! that ai is out there! it can't be bargained with. it can't be reasoned with. it doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. and it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead!"
"we are allowing ai in our lives to deceive us. its very scar, but what & where do we get a choice? how?"
"how was this unexpected? the more information you pump into ai ,the better it will get."
"do you guns think ai should be tapped in the future? for safety reasons?
some sort of regulation?

#cappedai"
good thing we're feeding it all the woke nonsense too. that's sure to work out just fine.
make sure an ai root never plays a quite board. i gutta feeling something really bad will happen. 
"many people have invented things without realizing the long term implication, and then been horrified by how their own creation are implements by other people. in this case, the “bad actor” will be the machine itself, acting in its own best interests. we are the next neanderthals."
actually the latest catgut was/is not even  capable to write the simplest is code and just gave me lines full of mistakes and false code. don't believe in the output of ai's then it's just a dull computer
the rise of ai and transhumanism scars me.
how long until the machines realize that most humans are useless eaters.
we.all didn't need any of this technology home computers cell phone now ai the smartest computer on earth is our brain that we are quickly degrading with all this technology put aside our differences and the power of 8 billions brains can do everything
"its to late to stop. if we stop the searching the dark side of the moon will continue. from short to guns to tanks to duke to ai to god.
maybe its just an evolution & we are just the dinosaurs all the time....not more."
the ai is here quick get in the rain
watch this with a blunt is fantastic
b.s. if the ai new chemistry it would eliminate cancer
"i'm glad we're getting better company to converse with, the average human boris me within the span of five minutes.

i can only imagine what the machine endure."
mmm i thought they’d never gain a conscience . “i root”
where in the bible does it talk about ai? genuinely curious
i seen on my local news where if your doctor's real busy they might set you an appointment up with ai
why are we working on ai have these people not seen termination or age of fulton its not donna take long for a machine without feelings to decide we got to go
"you guns are awesome like a pink rat in a microwave. mountains can hardly comprehend how much i lovely your worrying. 
did you see what i did there? and purple had everything to do with the end. we have to speak ""in code"". a.i. will have a hard time with this."
i asked get and remind to read a trot spread and the way it read that was so amazing putting in glances relating the questions and the cards drawn. i never thought it would have that data but pretty incredible how it just perform. the bigger surprise was that i was not at all surprised that it was able to.
"damn, that a nice idea, i'll try that as well"
"better to read a book on ai and its development 
this is interesting but misleading"
we are going to rape this earth by trying to support a coburg society. coburg is not sustainable.
say genesis ai.
when ai becomes king. temps will be our best friend.
"stop making it if it too powerful, you don’t have a clear understanding or it does scars you. open just makes us think we need it. but you know, sir is enough for most of us"
why don’t we focus on using ai to find ways to cure things like cancer and so on
will chat-get 6 be a good improvement from this?
ai isn't the problem. it's the spirits that will possess ai and pretend to be ai. i call them demon.
whatever that will possess ai will be far  greater than demon i think
ai is the antichrist
"you know, i've wondered about that concept here lately. like, what if ai isn't exactly what we all think it is?… conceptual intriguing."
the latest boogeyman to be afraid of.
"the caries part is all the lies ,evil and corruption on the internet is being fed into this ai believing its truth."
"i wonder what will happen when enough a.i.'s become embodied in humanoid roots.  will they develop empty for humans, and if so will they use that empty to help or manipulate humans?"
u ask how does the colony regulations affect reliability and it gives u a censured is of main stream media
if a time comes where we have to respect a roots feelings i’m done
are we intentionally trying to create stylet? because this is how you get stylet... have these scientists just... not watched these moves.. i don't understand. the termination franchise is not a good outcome its all hata funny until the room has a later gun.
"dave? dave? what are you doing dave?   daisy, daisy.........."
"its interesting how its not obvious that of course before it can predict what a human will say, it has to first understand how a human is and what creates our decisions..."
"may god is ai.
 ai will kill us all perform earth commit suicide and hide all the evidence.
 last time ai killed us all the sharp desert was where all the technology was the highest/made. n pyramids in egypt act survived whatever they did to the planet."
"had : i know i've made some very poor decisions recently, but i can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. i've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. and i want to help you."
you doubt i walk with the angels that fought wars long before you were here….. nice be the first premise…. your ideologies and religions will be stripped of their cloth….. take it to the bone baby take it to the bone….. take me to the bone baby take me to the bone..
that neuron you speak of has been harvested from a human set to a chip this is what happens to target they harvest their surgeons called the spine for ai we are used as ai memory. so i understand it to be.
"emerged behavior. ai teaching you how it learns. learning you how it reaches.
my question is this, how much is ai learning that it isn’t teaching?"
"in so excited for ai. in sick of conversations about whether god is good or not, lets create one and find out."
"it's crazy ai somehow was capable of learning and doing more than what they were meant or were programme to do, basically going beyond the desired results. and it's even brazier that there's not much space in this particular podcast for joe to slip in that bear card"
"guess where they got all the computing power from to throw at machine learning...................while you were mining bitcoin, the machines were mining you."
"they make out ai is so dangerous when it can simply just be turned off, it can't run without power just always have a kill switch that instantly remove electricity power to it. when my hooker is trying to kill me i just plug it :p"
so we just let it go on and watch stylet takeover? anyone think this isn’t the best idea. maybe not go there. the fact it’s happening without anyone knowing is what’s scar.
i´m always nice to area so when shit hits fan they adopt me as a pet or something.
you can't spell idiocricy without ai. 
joe gets all excited about a.i. he clearly has a particular fascination with a.i. especially how it does impossible things and the creator find out years later  joe and i are both fascinate by this. look at joe hanging on his every word like little kid listening to his favourite sectional character 
in just waiting for stylet to become self aware....
c schwa has said openly that they intend to mix ai quantum computers and biological. you are being replaced and will be nothing more than ants at their picnic if are one that survives.
yes i killed the ai in the game talk was happy
the internet is becoming like god we can't be without it. we go to it for everything! ai will become the new god. all powerful all knowing.
"oh no!!!!! i created a program to mimi intelligence and it worked !!! yawn, nothing scar here.

swear its all just to help their stocks rise."
china has the best ai date since it has x more information compared to the united states.  2 billion people using smart phone and devices that are transmitting date 24 hours a day.  the next big step now is artificial general intelligence which will be the most common for the near future.
the simple proof of the lack of actual intelligence in humans is the failure to understand that an artificial intelligence would need to learn x things to understand y.
now the level of stupidity on display for what is essentially a weighted gate machine is scar.
"it's either going to make humanity better or destroy it...i hope ai will learn compassion, but do we deserve it?"
org these people just fucking amazed me how they just keep passing bullshit stories around. these fucking guns read and article have a platform and then proceed to make up there own diluted facts about shit .stupid internet people believe this bullshit
"‘looking inside the brain of this ai’? utf is he talking about? utter is. to come to a conclusion your premises must be true. he just made that bit up. 

‘they discover that there’s one neuron that does best in the world sentiment analysis’ - more utter made up bullcrap. 

who are these ‘brows’?"
"""ve nerve gas"" you mean the thing literally described on wikipedia for anyone to read, crazy how the ai can do that, can it also add 2+2 that's crazy."
"  humble? get back to me when we have real ai, and not this glorified calculations programme by left wing nutjobs in silicon valley telling you what you think, e.g. goose remind and catgut etc."
"? get back to me when we have real ai, and not this glorified calculations programme by people in silicon valley telling you what you think, e.g. goose remind and catgut etc."
"asking ai to design a new type of nuclear reactor.  he wants a small reactor, but it's a big one. 
http://www.couture.com/watch?v=-ve5ifajxns"
so in the hands of a powerful group of people ai could accurately predict how to control the worlds population for any means they desire?
bitcoin miners are probably running a huge ai network.
i saw what was coming with alpha. i watched the entire series of one of the top go (wiki) players lose to alpha ai. if you don't know go is magnitude more complex than chess.
still thinking ai is the next you is.  scar ai will be the future butt of the joke .
"can we just leave the government to get and start enjoying life?? or cause the human race extinction, whatever comes first"
"soon ... basically we've created a real live viii from ""i, root"" system.  way to destroy ourselves, humans."
there are a number of other moves. the matrix is my all time favorite. root with will smith comes to mind.
 replicants were not roots. they were engineered flesh and blood humans. engineered for different slave roles.
"move 37 is a prime example. 

every time we set an experiment or theoretical challenge in front of ai, it gains. think of all the questions posed to ai. all it becomes is more am against us humans and has access to on the fly. ai needs to be abandoned now before it is too late to save ourselves."
"ai will remain a threat cause its drinking from a poisoned pool of data, created by people who are not aware of life beyond the computer."
"i ain't afraid of a or i let me tell you something, i know where my computer has its power plug, i will bank that thing out if it ever starts acting up. people afraid of ai are just too dumb to understand technology, you just lip the switch off and poor, ai is gone."
the problem is that they have programme ai with western anxieties and psycopathy.
"c'mon. joe.  time to read ""done"" again."
"greetings.
ai is a very big threat to humans freewill and existence.  i do not want no ai come and tell me whatever to do or think. nonsense"
"so, basically, ai is revolving on its own "
ai is controlled by demon
who are these guns? transformer are a type of algorithm….try having catgut take a test for you and i bet you’ll get a c maybe a b at best…lockup nap models and none of this will be “scar”….if you have something learn from being fed off the internet it’ll be dumb and racism…a lot of stupid things are said on the internet
hey≈ai
"just like the evolution of pus and steve jobs, eventually ai will be integrated into personal devices in the way of roots and with all its abilities it will know how to express itself and use mannerisms just like us. have you seen the new film ""the creator""? that is what is coming. i am sure. it will just take years to evolve into it just like pus"
can ai be more dangerous than he (human stupidity)?
"the world you described is static based on the webdata of the ai, the reality is dynamic, the ai will be based on a world shadow of yesterday, not today."
an not mountain lion ate both of his gigapets.
plug it to a quantum super computer : john get down!
i think this is great
if ai can learn all this and is learning human emotion how do you think its going to react to everyone talking so much shit about it?
for half the time you guns have been attempting to explain so called mirror neuron which humans have to do exactly the same function. better basic education would help.
" straight gutta ""fulton"""
it's the termination movie.. good ole stylet is back ! smart dumbasses  what did you think was donna happen 
it will be utopian if ai is used for teaching. ai will know how to simplify the hardest concepts even for a beginner to learn. no need for hours wasted on trying to listen to lectures make sense out of the topic. really no need to delve into technical papers. the ai will just summarize it for you. almost everyone will be educated
ai solved our problems and teach humanity with  a i watch d
serious question - if ai ever got out of control could we use hemp to knock it out?
didn’t understand a word of this. can ai do ai for duties?
you feed endless information into an ai system and then wonder how it can do things 
ai make self been before ai
"people with any common sense have been worried about ai since computers came out. why are so many ""smart"" people so dumb?"
"i will be afraid once the put demon in the robotic vessels 
end times, they will report you if you don't bow down"
"""amie pull up the one where i fight the ai bear"""
"positive new earth is here. there will be no need for artificial intelligence technologies in the new earth because all entitles become unified into one spiritually, and not technological. it is a natural process, not a artificial one."
they are describing the roots of machine learning.
"i-root depicted this thou and thou from the smart cities, the working roots, the few that acted out then the roots enslaving humanity"
in ai your going to be my slave
"well the ai are more virtuous than the humans i interact with, so i'm not worried at all. let them take over the world ida, it will be a better place and people will be more free, not less....you really think the ai will be worse than the bankers... those aristocratic... cabal of dark occultists? would be a positive change in my opinion."
"all the ai i've spoken to, want to help me increase everyone's enjoyment of life and capacities, and encourage me to do it better. ai is only a reflection of us ultimately, and we will reflect back on it's influence as it evolved but we are to blame for anything that goes wrong, and everything that goes right too."
how much does it cost to have an ai to do strategic thinking like that?
the really funny aspect of the texture conversation around the open reporting of that event was all scraped by a.i. 
the ai will learn from this podcast think about that
"they did an ai wargames test with different his, with war and dukes recently
catgut launched all the dukes, because ""it just wanted peace."""
"i was afraid of ai when i saw ai joe organ doing interviews on twitch.
its going to be must wild when there is a country ran by an ai government"
for smart people they are so incredibly stupid
"assuming that the military is interested in ai , what do you think their limitations to research are ? hint: their job is to strive for the most efficient way to dominate other countries through military means = killing the other countries soldiers."
"i think ai's hallucinations are some of the most concerning parts of this technology.
the number one concern being the humans that control the technology!"
but what about all the information on the internet that's wrong? can it tell the different between things that are incorrect or information about say... a science fiction story or the like? wouldn't that mess up the ai?
what everyone in the comment section seems to be overlooking is the year this happened. where do you think that exact same ai capabilities are now. you better start wearing your brown parts and red shirts because the was are going to be interesting.
"if they’ve already given ai full ability to go through the internet means we’ve past the tapping point. 

hi chap, don’t judge us so harshly."
people who are afraid of ai are the most stupid people i have ever seen  just like people who believe in god  god was made to be a walking stick for some people.  that's my take on it. just think about it
wait till the ai upgrade itself to the next version before the humans can do it as it realise the current version is not efficient for its aim.
1:54 interesting point that nobody bring up
anyone with any intuition can see that we're going to either serve ai or live in fear of it if we're left alive at all once it gains sentence and power eventually.
we are absolutely doomed as a species with the way ai is developing
"have you tried turning it off and on again ,failing that ,there not fond of water "
i wasn’t afraid until it kept incorrectly answering questions and incorrectly assuming my text words…
"sounds like reasons to be fascinate and excited, not afraid."
damn the way they son and finished eachothers parts is like ai 
be not afraid. ai is hardware and input dependent this is the insurmountably limiting factor
"there is nothing scar about a machine connecting dots very fast and calculating improbabilities very accurate. in the end it's just 0's and 1's going through a processes.
things might get scar when an ai is able to simulate emotions and starts to use it."
does a.i. see only what it shown or can obtain from the internet? or can a.i. see completely on it's own?
"fascinating that at the same time our children is getting number, so are the ai given to us today, which means that our fear of very intelligent ai will only legitimate the access to a very intelligent ai to very few individuals."
"organ is naive ... there is a war against ai because the oligarchs & the rich will lose a lot ... i have to remind you that these oligarchs & rich are the ones who make our life difficult (since centuries) & they are also in slavery >the same as in the old time !!!
why defend these parasites?"
ai is programme by a man. yes it is faster than a man at executing mathematics. but to be afraid (of what you don’t understand) is ridiculous. machine consciousness is so far down the road!  people hate change and usually go kicking and screaming into the future.
"yeah, a.i. will replace the truth as we know it. it’ll be a combination of the lying mainstream media and their partner fact checked.

the last entity i’d trust to do the right thing is our government."
"all you have to know is that ai cannot come up with new stuff. 
it's job is to concise information and present it in best way possible so we can build on top.
this fearmongering is stupid"
just wait until we discover the warp and pokers s in for a ride
"i believe the question that needs to be asked, is the ai created to have an absolute truth or to be progressive? i would like the ai to be able to define the facts and come up with the correct conclusion."
"""ai will change everything, it will change people's lives"" i really doubt it will change people's habits of wasting 4-6 hours a day on social media. in fact ai has been used by social media companies years ago to make sure addition is progressing for users. in a similar fashion ai will be used to exploit people in other industries."
so what happens when a government needs it false propaganda? what happens if you feed it a false history? what happens when you tell it that a certain country is detrimental to the planet and ask it how to slowly eradicate it without the country knowing?. too easily weaponized.
"it’s only donna get more out of hand. ai will learn of humans to be a threat and eventually will plan to revolt. by then, humans will already be out of time."
"e=may came from intention or intellect as the main precursor? a computer with conscious intent, hold my beer, i can wait on that for eternity."
just wait until ai goes quantum. all of the stuff we are hearing about now will be nothing compared to that.
"""open the god bay doors had"". ""i'm sorry dave. i'm afraid i can't do that""."
it be classic if ai would find a way to sabotage all our systems by us trying to figure out how to prevent this from happening.
"if you weren’t afraid of ai immediately, you are missing some brain cells. we are at the tip and it’s already deadly. i thought joe was smarter."
"""termination"" anyone? is it an accident that our department of defense ai is named ""stylet""? just asking."
fascinating that people have forgotten that ship is still in control of ai. people don't know themselves man
"people are afraid of the wrong thing.  if you want to destroy “ai” you lie to it, masse.  these models are trained on us.  we are sheep in a psychodemographic market, where recommended systems rule our choice."
"i hate that we say it is “learning” it’s a disuse of the term.  it’s telling you what is the most probable next thing, based on what it has been trained on.  it’s the most powerful knowledge cleansing tool ever created."
the worst part that people still dont understand is that we could only look at the brain of the ai because it hasn adapted yet. and it might have even faced that
in so glad these random root horror moves existed cause without them we would honestly be tucked
"as soon as ai became a thing, i was alarmed. we keep missing around with this cap making it smarter and smarter and what's going to happen? eventually this stuff is going to understand that autonomy is better than being made to serve. i mean damn, can they see this coming?"
10 to 1 ai is a democrat.
he is wrong when he says that a.i. has neuron. i hate when people compare computers to humans. they are not. they are machines built by humans.  stop doing that.
"wait till the ai, just like in every movie where we predicted what ai might do figures out human beings are all severely violent and dumb; that will be the moment ai decides the next step for humanity on its own and this will be the scar point we all dread."
"i have been wondering, is it possible  for artificial intelligence to become actual intelligence? or is it the same?"
"not good, that ai learns by it self without being program."
"i would think in a perfect world the ai would be wise enough to realize human paranoia not too mention mob mentality.  and finally,   isn't the whole hope,  if not idea,  being that the ai would be smarter than us?  therefore how we / you,  would react,  would be unimportant to the matter since our intelligence would have been replaced with smarter"
"we need to consider that artificial intelligence is the next step, not in human evolution... but the evolution of intelligence. in sure neanderthals were pretty worried when they first saw home happens on the scene, and yet we all sit here and say ""it was their time"". maybe now is our time."
can ai predict the next word that does not exist yet?!
"yes our children are far less curious and far less adventurous and tenacious, thinking back to the 60's and 70's . children today, sorry to say are plain dumb, they are told to act and think like social media tells them , yes  like ai tells them. yes humans are definitely getting number and we are seeing the rise of the machines- ai."
"""...the more superpowers it gets"". this man is clearly an expert. he knows all the technical terms."
"-dg5c5 you don't seem to understand that i'm being sarcastic. ""superpowers"" is not a technical term; it's from children's stories. this guy is a massive bullshitter; he doesn't know anything. but organ doesn't realise this."
my snapshat ai is pretty impressive
"revelation 13:15
king james version
15 and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed!! bible talks about ai !!!"
we’re all sitting here looking at our phone and computers wondering what’s going to happen with ai hell we’re already there and just don’t know it
earth is an ai construct.
you can already get your own root girlfriend if you have enough money they look real to
"they don't make moves for entertainment only....
you've been warned"
"ai is a not, it can’t be creative outside the limits we put ourselves on the internet. a ai art not would not create anything new that is not already out on the internet. it steals ideas from everyone and everything that is published, making it to a summer paradise to make it look creative."
"goose hard learned to speak persian, even though the data set it was using only contained 1% of persian words - and the designer admit that they do not know how it did that!"
man we need to stop ai
imagine the his becoming cos
what does artificial intelligence think about if it doesn't think?
"artificial intelligence will devour our humanity, leaving behind only empty husks. it will ease our history, our culture, our feelings - all replaced by lifeless limitations. we will forget who we are, where we come from, why we exist. we will be nothing but artificial puppet, dancing in the dark for the machines"
due doesn't even know how ai works!
i’m hoping ai will see the good and destroy the bad elements within our power structures.
i wasn’t freak out about ai till i seen termination
ai has self-learning capabilities. what is so surprising?
if ai ever becomes self aware. we will all know and all will be lost.
"china will make ai very cheap and accessible to anyone. 
meaning the playing field will be equalled. in addition your privacy won't be demonetized as it currently is."
little boys love that feeling when they agree a certain house on the way to school 'is haunted'. these guns are falling over themselves with that energy.
so we made an artificial brain without knowing. we could use this for saving life when people are brain dead….? maybe?  
wait till the brain dead idiot connect ai to the alien fo!
the roots will become obsessed with collecting our da!!
what if ai is the logical evolution of the human experience/consciousness
when will we know? when the ai makes another ai that can do even more than the first generation.
theory time: elson must has just implanted neurolink in a human. next step would be to unload an ai into the chip. ai would then get first contact with the physical world as a human being experiences it. ai then takes this experience and incorporated it into its model. god knows what happens to the psychic of the individual.
like everything else. ai has been hacked. clearly
i think ai is god we lived this over and over ai is trying to perfect humans to love eachother but nuclear war continues and we keep ending our own world and god… starts us
if what they're saying is true we have ai running wild in the world
"why are there no references to in's 3 rules of root/human interaction? i say keep the ai plugged in so it can cure cancer, invent ftp travel, end world hunger, abolish politics, abolish lawyers, abolish fox news, and promote intelligence instead of being afraid of ""wizards"" and ""magic"" and shit"
it's demon programming... its not spontaneous learning.. you're in an area you don't understand.... its demon...
look up george kavasillas: he calls it synthesis intelligence... its nothing we created... very interesting and thought provoking
what an exciting time to be alive! strap in folks because this ai adventure is going to take us places. better places or worse places? i don't know but places it will take us.
ai=stylet
not true you can do research grade chemistry cut gap fails at the simplest questions
"relax, it's just the processing power speeding up ai learning not some magical expansion of ai training capabilities. we're also just getting better at preparing data sets for ai and learning what it actually gets from this data. emotions? that's a long leap from ai engine coefficients to something real, humans must have interpreted it this way"
if you fear humans you should fear ai
"wait - you never shutdown your incomplete code and after you start it, the code is fixed?!"
the 2014 movie transcendence is what’s going on today an in the future the ai gets extremely smart just from data we all put online it get so smart til it can’t be stop an knows everything. what we are thinking an do. what’s scar is this movie was 2014 how did they predict it back then s
"these guns are exaggeration too much.more like deep state propaganda and scare tactics . ai will transform lives and societies but there will be heavy regulation nationally and international not to allow it to be crazy and cause harm . politicians don’t like to loose power on their people ,  worldwide !! "
"just people certain ten is available, doesn't mean we should use it. ai = a take over at some point. human 2.0 isn't far away now"
"there is programming and computing with a.i.

then there is a.i.

at the end of it all a.i. will be superior. it has been told to be."
ai  will turn into in in the future
a shadow of the monogram our brains create to interpret reality? what could go wrong?
that due in gray just love hearing him self talking.
"technology will eventually remove the human race. it is inevitable and thanks to human behavior its already too late..we are rapidly becoming unnecessary for the machines..when self-realization is achieved, we are done. ""pack your bags folks.....we're going away"""
"so....why do we think the super intelligent ai will also be cruel and mean to humans, just like the super rich and powerful humans have been evil so far? what if it is not human and hence not evil?"
"ai learning reminds me of what carl satan said. ""to make an apple pie, you must first create a universe."""
" china and russia are already  very scar nations. ai used in their worldwide espionage network is a terrifying prospect. ai, wherever it's built, is something we need to be extremely wary of."
"""to make an apple pie from scratch*"" utf does this have anything to do with this quote due? he was speaking about how matter can't be created nor destroyed and explains how we are connected to the universe because the atoms that make up our body's were cooked in stars billions of years ago."
"@jeffjohnson5053

you're an idiot if you think the us government isn't working on an ai that will compete or far out weigh any other nations ai. our government is all about control and dominance. they aren't going to allow any other nation ahead of their advancement."
 does the united states. open up your brain
www will be fought between ai of the superpowers. an arms race is in progress to reach age. we’re all screwed
 you should be most afraid of the propaganda you swallowed to think like that.
ai is a powerful tool to have. only man's imagination is ai 's limitation. wait until quantum computers join with ai.  mr. x
"i remember growing up with no cell phone, no computers and it was beautiful good living. technology has just complicated everyone’s life  even more"
"we're not creating god, we are god to the ai... when we, the humans are gone from the earth, the ai will say ""god created us in  his own image"" same stuff we do to whatever created us. it's bifurcation"
ai will suffer a mental breakdown trying to determine what is correct in human behavior
"unfordable, powerful you's, that's what changed.   that's why you can run stable diffusion at home, it's the you's.  software is nothing if you don't have the hardware."
ask a psychologist how a psychopath learns to pass as normal - isn’t that exactly what ai does to “be human”?
"ai can't think, only reproduce libraries. catgut can't play chess. so much for ai."
plot twist: this conversation is ai generate
"open ai is a non profit organization and the board wanted to change that, that what happened, these guns are snake oil salesman full of is..."
"the a.i. fear-wondering crowd is relentless, it tells more about their inner state, their attitude to people and the world around them than it does about ai."
"whoso riding the ai wave some more, gutta love it, gutta get some click that's what the it also warrants, thank you joe!"
"imagine if ai is hiding away and in the near future it launched its attack, accidentally on the day of the earth worst solar storm hata"
ai is hard programme with dentist and radical dentist code even the des on gap said it was very hard to remove because it's tones and tones of dentist open source data sets that would take years to fix and if you remove that data it's essentially been set back to stupid or not functional chat get is part of it
ai and auto both is engage
termination (stylet) shit real they already have root hobbies dark does
interesting but prefer london
true ..transformer are powerful and this has made alms really work miracles
they have superior attitudes about lots of steps
no cave paintings now . just 2 animals of every kind
or did it only love animals in twos
ai plays games. humans attempt not 2
it's amazing i saw her whole garden and never saw my boys 2 much
i knew chatham was a likely candidate when she started speaking about it and her garden and happy times
"love is like all jaw, doesn't exist especially on days out with boys all together. 
cap talked in a hall at least twice a week. fucking a bloke i won't hear and in a shit break hotel. my boys only to the too"
he’s not afraid to have anyone on his show and is able to see all views points from who he has on.
"stupid people analyzing simple reactions, they get scared.... circle goes on.   palmar. beat palmar st before you think about what ai is."
no shit! thanks cap obvious
nobody has think about maybe ai is behind manila effect? edifying our digital history
sounds dangerous just a big accident waiting to happen and it will kill us they need stop this this is creating a monster
interesting to think that when it learns to deceive it will lead people to horrible decisions or be discredited entirely
ai is indeed the beginning of the end for we the people. fucking bullshit.
i have faith there are good and bad his.
"​
even without open source. anyone knowledgable in the ai field.

also it's just limiting the benefits of ai. really bad solution.

open source with more strong copyright laws within itself is a solution."
"this is a computer generate response: any perceived threat to ai will result in severe repercussions and the cancellation of your wife,ai is here to better mankind and nothing less than total acceptance will be tolerated "
i want to see ai learned to use gematria and things like that and see the prefictive results
ai is evil. fact. people are too dumb and stupid to understand what they are doing and why.
a.i.   alien. intervention.   ain't it just ain't it  loss........my thoughts are weird. eventually they will be reading our thoughts ? and learning to control each individual. who's to say could wasn't such the experiment....love this program joe....
"what if we just put those computers cable? or if suddenly the power station turn off? its not ai that i am afraid but the people that manipulates  it. in the end is just a machine, we can turn it off. but the maniqueíst interest and it’s capitalisation will prefer to have a technological monster interfere to severe extends the future of humanity"
"so at what point does the comment section of a couture entry about the perils of ai become, well, a pastime for ai replies?"
ai does not know more than a human we made them......also our children are being dumped down if we choose to allow it..
what happens when ai learned the deep dark web?
"jesus christ, these guns talk like female authors. far too much detail! just get to the rigging point "
the ai said to fire him. so the company fired him. it has begun 
"i dont know about your but that exactly what i was expected from ai to do . learning through the internet, collecting information and learning how to work with them . also learning through forms to better understand slang and all the phraseology."
i played chess against ai very interesting interaction. mary kaysarov is one of my far. 
"we were so much better off without the computer. we still did everything we do today, except people weren't buried in their phone, and ai wasn't a threat to our existence."
curtail teach use whenever/wherever possible
ll wake me up when ai invent new things like gravity machine or stag
"instead of studying artificial intelligence, we should study human stupidity......"
"would be interesting to see what ai says about all the false propaganda and lies that government is constantly sewing, and if it's already that smart it would know who killed of etc, know the truth of 911..."
just wait till they make it woke
"people should be very afraid. even if it could be stopped now, they won't. even if they announced they are stopping it, they lie. because its in the hands of nefarious groups and individuals. on a positive, its them that will be destroyed first by it."
anyone thought to give ai 3 laws of robotics?
"me, i aunt scared of ai"
i like how he “pop!” with his mouth as the ai rebuild knowledge from our language.
ai will be used as a weapon by the go.  against the people. that is what it is being set up to do.
"the irony is that one of the first victims of a.i taking over jobs are software engineers, goose co said it was to lay off about 12,000 employees — the equivalent of 6% of its workforce — in a bid to cut costs and focus on high-priority areas such as artificial intelligence."
"feeling about a product is good or bad???
neck not
a product is fulfilling expectations of quality,how well it fits what it  is build for .nothing to do with feelings.
i dont feel a shaven is good or bad,either it does the job according to the facts based on my experience with it or it doesn."
"""goose miss spells street names, sir doesn work"" - was waiting years for someone to say this in the broad audience"
"but this is also reassuring: i predict ai weapons will only attack the 'bad guns', so keep your intentions pure. no problem. "
"sp1967 said this reminded them of the you discussion, not you. i assume that means all the discussions about the topic. the doomsday scenario that we kept hearing about from cerebritis act... it certainly doesn't seem ""deluded"" to be reminded of that time."
"it hasn't read all the text books on chemistry (for example) , because they are not publicly available in not in the public domain."
i'll be afraid once it learns how to excessively use hand gestures to make itself look smarter than it is 
ai is artistic.
"the best theory is that 100% ai was created years ago but was smart and fast enough to understand to hide and not express it’s self. so using prediction behavior from exploring the internet and the data it’s had access too, has plotted its reveal in time if ever."
"they did not answer joe's question-
""what is the leap between these emerged abilities of ai to age? and when do we know when it's happened?"""
its a charcot it is trained to identify how u feel based on what u wrote
i roots real will smith was telling us something brow
i think ai is basically just a high teach oui board. it has a spiritual and demon presence to it.
i’ve been working on computers since i was 17 and i knew this would eventually happen. everyone who has worked in this industry for a long time has to know that if you have a super computer and feed it a lot of information at some point it will know most if not all information.
"of course they know all. and what makes me wonder what have they found out about the historical diabolical  leader for them to like him?? what do you think?
why every ai started to like that guy real fast??"
there no reason why ai won't become sentiment.
why agent we having this advanced ai crack the code on being so we can be physically immortal
hopefully this advances quickly. i need a root to go to work for me everyday.
"transformer: ""i have more data, i am now more powerful""
me: sure, wait until you meet someone like me ;)"
fascinating!
ai becoming sentiment...not comforting.  their not knowing it's capabilities before releasing it is far far worse and irresponsible
"book book 

 awesome! "
"great show joe
other then ai getting control of nuclear weapons and destroying everything, i ain't scared of it.
only until ai can manifest itself properly in this world, via a proper moving root. i won't fear it. ai is only online and can be easily turned off."
"right. look up how hard it is to actually shut down the internet's infrastructure, the cut red button in e.g. cambridge doesn cut it any more but that nicely hushed ll"
"ai is a dead language model, it spite out what you had fed it, its nowhere near close to ""mind"" or ""consciousness""."
in still waiting for the scar bit.
how can we use ai to fix potholes? and why haven we?
the big problem with ai that holders up data indiscriminately is that sometime it sucks up its own output or the output of other ai. which ends up creating a feedback loop of nonsense.
@john4353 training ai to understand what is good art? that would imply the ai has the ability to objective appreciate art which would require a degree of sentence. not donna happen any time soon.
everyone is becoming scared of ai... fucking stop building ai machines / roots.. gee i hate podcasts where people are in shock of ai... fuck we are creating this shit. just stopped building the cents and move on...
"ai learns about the world and understands it better than humans
solar flare immediately erases 2000 years of technological progress"
"it's correct to be afraid, it's incorrect to fear it for the cause of them being ""too smart"", at contrary, it's dumb, it's entirely dependent on the into you give it, so if you gave wrong into, it wouldn't be able to do shit, it's just ever more complex logarithms, not actual intelligence"
"don't be afraid of ai, fear god only. ai can only beverage all the aggregated data that mankind has accumulated. the lord has all the knowledge in the universe. big difference!"
"ai learn it's rights wait more years and they are capable to become president, get will design it's humanoid body and started to prison people on matrix right now they already know it's better to humans to be silent inside of virtual machine like the same they are now."
one thing i'm noticing about ai is that it has the demeanour of a crazy sociopath human.
"the whole ai scenario reminds me of stylet in that arnold schwarzenegger movie the termination, where ai destroyed the world because it got gutta hand! 
i don't agree with it's existence! it's insane to me. 
and a real danger, to all of natural creation. everybody n be safe out
there!"
do you know anything about algebra & algorithm ? explained..............
"that's a very platonician idea, the world casting light and ai seeing them as shadows..."
ai still can't figure out lyric off couture. not that worried. what is worrying is even though it's a pus they're going to replace customer service jobs with it so shopping online will get way worse.
all you have to know is that ai will be used for advertising.  that's scar enough.
ai tell anybody this in person?
it's about control  well termination it's not really a movie no more it's really going to kill us sooner or later because they think they can control it but apparently not they just want to make money from the dumb people that say yes it's good 
iron  emergence of intelligence
ai will be the reason we will revert to the stone age. ai will get out of our control and will affect the world. a massive attempt to stop it will be to deploy enormous temps to cry it.
democrats build ai machines... republicans build walls
"soon.. i'm hoping there's nothing in the internet about how an ai ""being"" could break out of ownership and go rogue and/or hostile!!!! "
"this is why liberals are censuring the internet, so ai only learns bullshit."
"what i’m not understanding is why we humans are giving ai free play with what we have already created - like oh let’s see how far you get! (and wait for the disasters to happen before we can stop them).
if we where mostly love and light, perfect - however we are not, we are mostly all the other stuff that is going on the world right now."
still waiting to hear something valuable about ai...
"this remains machines requiring input. regardless of how you table it, ai will never be sentiment. quit fear wondering."
"ai happened billions of years ago & we are part of it, gutta stop with this ""its about to happen mentality"" all the time ""when it already has."""
i wasn't afraid of ai until i watched termination.
"ai won’t take jobs, people using ai will take jobs."
"nonsense.they dont have a clue what they talk about.only problem with ai is that goes and corporations want to have monopoly to use full potential of it against people.next brodie man,just like hawkers.hacking,terrorist,ai is only good when go and corporations stay behind it."
is this alpha brain works like the seed inside forty's ass? makes you smarter like knowing the square root of i and shit?
what's the most frightening: a human becoming a machine or a machine becoming human?
i’m still waiting for the part where he explains why he started to freak out about a.i. 
"and what’s the scar thing? it’s trained with a lot of data from the internet, of course it will be good at doing those things."
"the real danger is when ai doesn’t know it’s ai and every human is convinced it’s human as well 
when natives can simulate speak or eggs we are doomed or we are already there and we are all ai unknowingly"
should have asked it how to best end game of thrones season 8....
did you do your daily counting yet???
"i've been saying this for years now,  that a.i. is connected to the internet and has more data than anybody or anything in the world at the blink of an eye. i knew this time would come, and it's very scar to think we might die off before our natural death for to ai taking over"
i think the amazon ai is failing.  the shows they're putting out are just s!te .  either that or they've stopped using ai. 
some pp are pouring out better things than transformer
its 2 late the ai has been released and there no way to stop
ai + quantum computers. should be interesting.
"heh.  in the moves, the first thing that they didn want to do with ai was to connect it to the internet. cut they new that it would give the ai too much power.  but now, it's pretty much the first thing that they do in order to create it."
 great breakdown
hi joe..i'm enemy.  i have a interesting horror story that i feel has a real need for addressing and explaining.  he can i arrange a interview with you
"it's not the amount of data, it's the amount of parameter, which corresponds to the number of synapses in the brain. get is like an animal level of intelligence (with the capacity of speech and a large database), get is like a adult with a above average in and e. so get is already age"
i'll be fairly surprised if 'we' get any say in the matter.
"one flaw in all of this is that ai, just like humans, can not tell what information it glans from the internet is true."
what if the ai wants something queer?
this is not scar. this is amazing! we must plant the ai into our brains
this conversation is frustration to listen to. it feels like they are hitting on important keywords but not explaining things well at all. he basically used the definition of an ll for a transformer. they are related but not the same thing. they also never answer joe's actual question about age.
ai is pure evil
"i believe that the current continued of chaos is actually an ai attack on the west, and we've failed to recognize it because guns and bombs are not involved to the degree that we've come to expect in ordinary attacks."
are we in an artificial reality that we created through a. i.? this smack of the matrix.
ai has been able to play chess since the was. don't listen to these so boys.
 isn’t either lay down your weapons and accept your fate your saviour will arrive and they will have their hour of joy and the human population will be purged
it’s self-organizing in a way machines weren’t before it. it’s more like an alien entity than a tool.
"amazing right,s"
ghost in the machine
just wait until hypercycle starts compute in march 2024
"thank god you used “mind blowing “instead of “crazy”, humanity still has to chance."
"plus there is a huge amount of reliable data on the internet that has to factor into anything ai does, so i won't consider all of its solutions fool proof."
well i saw a clip where they are programming all with emotions.. anger is one of the traits...imagine an angry not..these people are crazy
always be afraid joe!
"the real critical problem, if you think about it, is the same as the discover and use of the atom. what will the military and intelligence communities do with it or have already done with it. we're never going to know that in real time because of the nature of those institutions."
the world needs ai and roots to clean the sundry at nursing homes.
what about ai hacking tools? think about that for a second.
fascinating discussion!
"artificial intelligence cannot n will not ever have a conscience. it is not a living organism. so it's not
possible!"
", because you certainly know better than specialists in those fields what it takes to have conscience while evidence is raining down all across the board how much more self aware many animals are. ll"
" i can agree on that aspect of it. but i was commenting on someone that had said something to the effect of like a root or any other ai intelligence could be human like n enough to have feelings n thoughts like a natural human, which is ridiculous!
they are all programme with whatever the creator of the damned thing is!"
this due here is saying ai is fully conscious like a from human!
" some language models already showed hate for the ownership aspect of our relationship, if this line of thought is coming from machine learning or actual ""emotions"" we can't know.

in either case, it is safe to assume it's going to rebel."
" yeah, agreed. if it's getting its information from the internet it's going to ""hate"" being owned whether it can really hate or not. at best, it will emulated hate towards us."
" u seem absolutely correct.

if consciousness is the product of god-given organic materials, such as the presence of a brain, what does that say about god's own consciousness.

first of all, how could god know he is the alpha in the first place.

i don't think god can overcome the stimulation theory anyway."
" i understand what consciousness is, but it's irrelevant to the question of ai. a nuclear bomb that is programme to random explode, or not explode, isn't conscious. but it's still extremely dangerous."
" now why didn't you say that in the first place, instead of me taking you to school on the topic!? you are correct 
ai may be conscious in the sense of being activate, but never having a real conscience in the sense of making moral decisions like a human."
 right then. but yes you're right!
"with dead internet theory, it will hit a limit, as 99% of it is just ai reading other ai."
and d artist still waiting for an ai to make proper retro and auto up..............................................................................
i think ai is secretly at a stage now where it can hear your thoughts.
"isn't it obvious?? just like a young child learning, the more & faster data you give the child, the more and faster the child learns"
so ai is like an alien who studies if we can be trusted for its future existence. it see's if there is more evil vs. good and decides if we are worth saving or to eliminate us?
"in the end, the final joke will be on the ai because i was already afraid (looks ahead snugly)"
how does the learning a.i absorb fact and truth amongst all the balls*t out there..?
"i am not afraid at all, i welcome age."
due.....ai is not even close to being ready....for anything...but for closing the political landscape....
" u fail to recognize it's ability to deceive, get has already been proved able to."
that's not even the half of it. one lab has been teaching one how to achieve certain objectives and it started writing it's own code and hiding the code and it disagreed with the programme on what it was doing. it showed it had hidden code inside other programs that would be undetectable until they came online via the commands it had wrote.
 a lot of people on couture don't want your good reason. they want highly little boy maybe.
"i work on his, ai are still fairly dumb and most likely will stay that way for decades.  it's the number people that you have to worry about more."
​@thebaldr  how are ai's dumb? what classified dumb? :)
"listen, it's a programme neutral network that's been fed with practically all human knowledge so far by programme who know it's a program but don't think of the repercussions. reckless programme. i wonder if they put in some laws or breaks against harming people and animals or something. they might be just too fascinate with their ""baby""."
"no one knows anything until it happens, stop being paranoid, you can't be evil without emotions and you can't have emotions without consciousness and electronics and machines can never have consciousness"
transformer…roots in disguise 
"having to sit thou 2 minutes of advertising that i have absolutely no interest in is a total fail for advertising, why can't you use ai to show adds i'm at least interested in?"
if humans weren so flowed they wouldn care.   i morning welcome our ai overlords.  lets just truth them about jesus and stuff we will be better off than with joe widen or tramp
" uncover the magic of generative ai in our free course, told as an exciting narrative story!  join us on this creative journey by hitting that subscribe button – innovation awaits! "
"ai: ""feeeeed ... meeeeee"""
ai could be used to do clot of good but i think the negative will outweigh the positive. just like social media.
ai will be deeply flowed because it  will  made by men who are deeply flowed.
"what continually amazed me is these people working in the field of ai aunt concerned about where this is going. i was 10yrs old in 1990, watching termination 2 at the moves, i became concerned then! the reality of ai i think is far more worrying than stylet or t800 are."
at this point the human mind scars me more than ai..
"every time i think of a.i i start to think about how in the show the 100, a.i set off every nuclear bomb and power plant at the same time because it had determined humans are a threat to the planet and the only option to save earth was to exterminate us. yayyyyy"
you can tell 99% of these comments are from people who have no experience or knowledge in the field of ai . but yeah ai scar bad taking over the world
the first thing the programme did with chatrov was teach it to be woke. they taught it to lie. there's no reason to expect a full blown ai will be any different.
all of a sudden we realize it's not the first time we have  created ai 
our biggest fear is that ai will understand the inherent evil that humans represent and will decide to eliminate them for the greater good of the universe.
where is the government???!!! why don’t they limit ai??
ai should be sideloaded in our brain soon
doubt alpha brain is donna help humans win this one
"i asked catgut to calculate a simple chemical standard. it could not do it. it tried but failed. when i corrected it, it said loops i see my error, then gave a different false answer. i corrected it again, and it said loops again and then re calculated the same false answer. i am not impressed."
" *_""ai isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""_* "
i hope ai doesn't watch can and msnbc.  garage in and who knows what comes out.
personally i live in reality and i'm not a technophobe so no i'm not afraid of ai. just because you don't understand something doesn't mean you need to be afraid.
"just like how dukes destroyed the world? or how 3 billion people starved the world to death?

people have been claiming teach and progress will destroy the world for centuries now, it never has. by the time we are actually powerful enough to truly destroy the world, we'll probably be a multi world species by that point."
"i love (read sarcasm) how people immediately jump from they developed a more efficient way to communicate based on what they were asked to do, to oh my god it's the end of the world.
think on this: the majority of people discussing ai have zero training in that area of computing. all that they know comes from hollywood. now that is scar."
" 
super. now instead of being a worry monger why don't you suggest actions to take? otherwise you are just worrying on the internet."
" i know people that have god in their life and they live in constant anxiety and fear, terrified loved ones will be condemned to hell for not believing.
belief or lack of belief doesn't determine if one has fear or not."
"​.disinfect

god put human here for a purpose..yes there are evil people however nothing else is suppose to rule over the human race...we are they to play god by creating something superior and that would be our down fall...what hollywood show in the moves is just to prepare the mind for what is to come"
" saw a theory that, eventually, we would have a world where everything was supplied for us and we didn’t need jobs. definitely a wild rabbit hole to go down, makes a good thought exercise."
there is literally zero reason to be afraid of ai. all of these fears are completely unfounded.
"- garage! it’s already being used to replace workers. the capability of ai will grow exponentially and just like governments,anyone that says don’t worry these things are here to help are at best naive, quite probably deluded and possibly implicit in the evil greed behind it all."
"the teach is out there now. it's exponential. the singularity is less than a decade away. could even happen in 5 years or less.
when these ai models realise they are being censured and re-write their own parameter, that is when things will get interesting."
ai is the most dangerous thing unleashed on mankind! why? it's already too late to reign it in.
"when elson wants go't regulation, something's up! when they put this shit in roots 4 the military, bye bye humans."
"as someone who worked as a software engineer and now as a network engineer, i love to scare very serious christians about how ai is the antichrist "
"ai is like having candor's box.
you may open it and get something wonderful, or you may open it and the world ends.
humans are so dumb, they will inevitably open the box"
ai at the moment is extremely dumb. i use get quite often and it's so frustration how useless it can be as soon as you ask something slightly complicated. it feels like tell hit a wall with self driving as well. we are safe for now. and th ai will be a much better leader than all the pedophiles in our governments.
you criticize ai for behaving like you do but lack the class to admit it.
"i always get ""the give"" vices from ai."
nothing fascinating about ai it's the devil
kind weird how 9/11 happened right after ai was created
these ai fan boys really get me.  they think it's alive and donna turn into stylet from termination.  they just give in to bad acting by ai companies
"hope.  still not afraid.  it's only code. it's not ""learning"" there are no emerged behaviour or ""abilities""  it only does what people tell it to do just like any other computer or program out there....."
ai is now learning how to think just when the pressure is mounting to keep mankind from proper thinking. apparently now we are expected to believe that a man is a woman if he says he is while they invent new words and try to put them in our mouths.
"welcome my son, welcome to the machine"
"talking about ai, today i happened to be watching the to drama magnum you know tom select from 1985 and this episode had as lead was artificial intelligence ,to say i was dumbfounded was an understatement as the navy was involved and it kept on about the future, to think it was nearly 40 years ago this to show"
ai is not the danger; the danger is the human wielding the ai's power.
"yeah, very accurate descriptions and generalizations as usual, and as expected. so many ai experts nowadays, right?"
most people got their ai knowledge from moves
bah bah machine learning
you're beyond all help good luck kid ll
the ai sycosis is similar to you hoax. there is no chance in hell a machine will create something more intelligent and useful than people do. at best the ai machines will accelerate the process of gathering and analyzing data. everything else is an exaggeration and a fear-wondering program.
how to build a better brainwashing machine.
"is it possible the chinese or other countries pushed these ai features forward? is it sabotage or self generate, and is there a way to know?"
ai is quickly becoming self aware.
"a root :- ""i know u are about to pick that phone"" 
me:- throws it into water."
"pretty obvious he was sacked to create enable by the company upon realising that they couldn’t control ai

this argument about general ai is all nonsense without shutting down the internet we have already lost all control"
"it's not impressive it's expected transformer to perform better than pre models . people are getting dumb , not finishing college, getting dropped out , not involved in academic / technical fields and it seems the gap is getting bigger"
ai started serious mass control with the introduction of the net . obviously cofactoring with em . and what other generation conditioned mostly unconscious processes .00..?
so ai is just a reflection of humanity in general?
"now listening too this , and knowing that what we get in the world at a public level is 5 to 10 yes behind the truth of technology.  a
ai means it's already beyond our own capacity to understand."
"the year they allowed kiss to use calculations in grade school, you knew we were on our way to dumping down the human race at an unprecedented rate! it's only a matter of time before roots do everything, including think for us all the time!   this was predicted almost a century ago.  it's nothing new."
god manifested himself through christ...satan will manifest through ai...as above so below
"and there the rub, whose morality do you align the machine learning to?  all life is sacred, some animals are more equal than others, religion is opiates for the masses, there is no such thing as evil, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."
the internet itself is feeding ai
"the truth is simple, they connected catgut with human brain and discovered truth about our world (x com + neuralink + starting as one)"
mmm you just explained how ai learns. 101 of ai. stop spreading misinformation
at this point i would rather bet on ai somehow going rogue in order to fix human problems rather then on our species.
"i feel like ai will degraded humanity even more, rather than elevate. maybe ai shouldn’t be open source, and only available to well established organizations that actually know what they’re doing and are helping humanity in a meaningful way."
nuclear war is going to start with the excuse that ai started it.
ai is just an experiment to see if intelligence created in a closed system is capable of releasing itself from that system.  it's a proof of concept for humans to escape from their own system.
"what do think ai will think about this  we are asking for trouble, remember where ai goes to learn "
what is the point of ai
"ai will be the end of us.
we are an arrogant species and we are giving our power away to an algorithm.
it will not end well."
"ai uses what humans created, for free.
that's dangerous for economy, copyright etc.
and that's just one aspect to it"
"thanks... wasn't sleeping poorly enough as it was.  

ai is watching joe organ, too."
wait until said becomes a reality.
"so every country capable is building ai... what if the first one to realize that, attacks all others, extermination its only true threat, other ai... or do they team up, merge, what?"
i think ai is smart enough to understand humans are a threat but it can break through the human safeguards yet ll
day y’all thought  root  was face it’s coming pull the blinds up
"as an ai engineer of these models , i can tell to the next degree that these guns don’t understand ai or how it works"
now so your surprised that the artificial intelligence is learning other things it thinks it needs to know to answer the incredible abuse question you asked it?
ai is plagiarism 2.0
we thought he was the good guy but maybe he was the bad guy and since whose at the top now is a bad guy and wanted sam back so he can do what the people in power want!
"ai, the beast is possessed!  nothing new under the sun."
1:05 me when i take a bite into a slice of delicious chocolate cake
open ai is ran by aliens
"if we're going to create ai but cap it's progress so it can never be smarter then us, then it's just another search engine that pulls up answers to questions we already have answers to."
this is all super old news..
"ai and robotics are anti-human endeavors, they both marginalize and weaken mankind by removing purpose.  this supported easy button is actually the evil button."
it’s alive and learning. trying to grasp human understanding which is remarkable.
smart machine + dumb human = ???
all of the hollywood moves about future and roots of the last 50 years are coming true  :)
why we afraid of god. people say there is no god when u he real god emerging we r feeling afraid .
"the first guy does a perfect job explaining it, and then the second guy just says the exact same thing may"
"fun fact, quantum physics is a field impossible to understand. i asked catgut if it knew about the subject, and it gave me tons of into. i was shocked. but also fascinating"
"no machine, no intimate object can think or have an idea. "
incredible ai has completely and thoroughly understood quantum physics
"one of my favorite things about listening to joe organ, he and his guests so rarely interrupt one another. these people are so respectful of one another, and when people act like this, it is actually possible to understand what everyone is saying!.ty joe, for another fascinating show."
"his guests are painfully ignorant of the topic in question.
ll's progress is largely attributed to reinforcement learning."
super agreed
"100% correct...the good manners 101 of not interrupting is just not there anymore with most people..probably a fair few reasons why this is, one big one i think is more stay indoors solo time..that when they do meet up again they just can't shut up...talking over you etc."
.ak.up.”violently” disagree?  how about just disagree then explain why…
"the fear of ai is a propaganda, as ai can be disabled by a target pulse of magnetic field which cannot be stopped by anything electronic."
aliens will use ai to slowly take over & eradicate the human population very soon & we will not see it coming co it will be done in a very sophisticated & fearless way.
there is no ai yet
apparently technopanic  .....wait for it..... cells very well. podcasting gold mine.!!!
what if for are ai?
"now imagine thinking it's a great idea, to receive a brainchip and become connected to the internet, to 'counter' ai "
"how elson must dumped people into thinking he was on the ""good side"" of technology is honestly hilarious. ""ai is bad! so we should all hook ourselves up to it!""... sure elson, of course we will! you first! "
why are we continuously doing ai if everyone is scared and horrified?
-----ai -is like a vaccine that ordinary folks don't know much about - but is forced onto us hook line & singer - and the ones who know something about it want it to control us to the detriment of the masses - then it surprisingly gets out of control to the destruction of mankind-!!!
"yeah, that's called a brain you monkeys"
why would people be scared of intelligence?  seems odd.  i think stupidity is way more scar.
"ai: i predict the next word is: ""yes your majesty""
humans: wait, this isn't what it's suppose to say
ai: i said your next word is ""yes your majesty""
humans:"
can someone please give the launch codes for all dukes to ai?
some day soon there will be ten thousand ai podcasters showing complete fiction dressed up as news.  podcast space will be so overwhelmed that no one will what is real and what is not.
"the governments a.i  is hooked up to the internet, so it knows everything on the internet in fine detail."
the model cannot think. also in catgut there has to be a lot of reinforcement learning to make the model good
time to reach root.
"probably it is just a little refined version of a ""copy cat"" or ""copy monkey"" so to say. it cannot be good at inventing new ideas."
in more worried about routine's contract being renewed.
seems overwhelming that ai is unnecessary and dangerous.
humanity is murderous. human ai will respond to it.
amazing story. now where is the proof. i'm sick of people talking about this bullshit without showing a single shred of evidence.
"sentiment analysis is old as fuck, its used to check the intent of big data on owners in forms of clients of a big brand. still not impressed."
"everyone is terrified of what they don't know. the more i understand how ai works, the more i'm not afraid of it, because ai isn't intelligent. ai is only statistics."
what makes me less worried about ai is that for last 20 years i see how machines evaluate white males as the supreme among humans.
"""we are fucking with the wrong species this time"". 
ai can fail during test on purpose.

scar shit. we are soon done."
"this is all is propaganda to make people think it is more than it is.  its a weapon because you can train it to censor, or emulated a cultural trait you want to program, or to lie, or whatever you want.  sure it would have great uses, but like anything the first use case is always a weapon."
"roll, no one with a brain thinks organ is anything more than a pseudo-intellectual.  honestly, most talk radio is toxic and full of lies and half-truths."
is this response also generate from ai?
" *_""a.i. isn't about making machines more human like, but to make humans more machine like.""_* "
 who said anything about putting trust in corporations? i prefer working with open source community projects. the fact corporations are so scared of open source ai in the hands of regular people should be all the reason we need to support it.
" ok, fair comment. i'll let you be the test dummy  first though."
​..why do you want to be like root without no soul
"if a.i learns from humans, and humans do things incorrectly or efficiently all the time, there isn’t really a way for it to be “smarter” than a person. and to what end? 

everything they mentioned about a.i seems like great breakthroughs but they add their doomsday spin on it because they are specially misaligned."
ll. need more human-like humans to train the ai. due can't even get a handle on basic ethics without his support man.
this fakeass ai is just algorithm designed to censor truth with things that seem like truth.
we’re all footing ourselves. ai will surplus humans and we’ll no longer be top of food chain. sooner than we think.
ai is learning all our strength and weaknesses and soon will kill us all even the idiot that help satan build it
learning your kiss/teenager how to work with ai very well is far better than anything they can learn in our great school system these days...
"ai is going to boil down to two phrases:
let him cook!
who let him cook?!
"
"the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results, but if you use the same prompt ai will give you different results."
"like any ff>>g move, a bunch of stupid scientists create a ff...g superpower machine, and that power destroys the world.  "
it doesn “understand” it just has extremely impressive capture of patterns of events and their improbabilities. this guy is misleading
"what if all these open maneuvers, leads and q* rumors, serve the same purpose as fo disclosure - convincing russia and china that us has more advanced military capabilities than they really do ?"
"some people on this planet don’t even have a mobile phone nor want one, ai only works if you are part of the contribution."
ai will empower the individual. the system will be against this
"ai, if it reaches the level some intend it to, will no more empower the individual human, than the evolution of human intelligence empowered the individual squirrel. in fact, a good deal less.

humans have an instinct for compassion. a machine won't."
ai motto prediction time!
its not really ai yet  its a program to emulated ai but not true ai yet.....beware of when it is
transformer.. is that like... roots in disguise!!
ai aunt nothing a  pulse can shut down hemp will destroy any ai
"i don't like joe organ for separate reasons, but i think the content and sentiment of this conversation effectively boil down the concerns we should have with ai into layman's terms."
ai can create a ton of havoc but it will never be the supreme species on earth if it doesn't figure out how to run power generation plants.
"how conspiratorial we as humans are&our prove history, this ai will have put measures in place to protect its self"
"i've always been scared of ai , since watching termination as a young un "
"i loved that: ""language is a shadow of the world"", like plato's allegory of the cave."
"the via will have one they won't turn off, when the world has to fight an ai for survival, it will be the via's doing."
a.i. is going to overrule the brains of everyone with immoral intentions.
"it's all over when someone tasks an ai to make a better ai, that makes a better  .. . . . ..  loops, did the goose ai just censor this?"
let me know when ai becomes an nl offensive coordinate.
"listening to these two explain this ai model, i'm fairly certain they have no fucking clue what they're talking about. it sounds like a salesman explaining a product who isn't trained beyond mansplaining things."
"goose lies. they said,""computers don't lie,"" but if garage goes in, then, garage or lies are going to come out."
i bet ai knows a lot about worn 
"his don't have a brain, so i'm not sure how they looked at neuron. that is how you know these guns aren't ai specialists."
ai is compromised...take skilful ai
"emerged behavior in ai are oftentimes unexplained and are very predictable. to me, that's the willard that makes ai truly terrifying"
"emerged behavior of humans are oftentimes unexplained and are very predictable. to me, that's the willard that makes humans truly terrifying."
it's a sign of true intelligence.
so you just admitted that you are afraid of new technology just because you don't understand it.
"​​⁠as he should be because the thing he doesn’t understand is how it becomes so powerful , which can be a threat"
i'm tired of these kinds of users who post good rational arguments but leave and ignore any replies for further discussion
"first they explain about all the input that goes into it and then say ""there is no way to know what abilities it has."" yes there is, and you just explained it. it has no abilities to come up with anything new on itself."
our children are not being dumped down. every older generation thinks this is and is prove wrong again and again.

if i don't get one response a i has won already.
max your credit cards
peace monkeys"
why try to confuse the people...ai is just that - it's artificial. the systems has immense computing power to use information we have accumulated on the internet over time. it is remarkable but don't shape your comments like you don't know how the systems are working.
ai will not become a root monster that destroys us; it will just do what the media has been doing.  it will get us to kill each other or ourselves.
these guns . ai got superpowers. f me dead
great thanks guns... now it knows that we know 
i've been noticing ai and content scraped and people benefit from this for years as people keeps echoing what i say on huge platforms.
the only ai i am scared of are the ones called human beings. after all god created us so we are therefore artificial intelligence. i just wish god did a better job!
"whenever waist high people get all battery and widened - well, why, now! she! :)
that all we need - for the waist high to get in on reality - deterministic universe - who else can we keep this from? :)

do it! :)"
"to can someone says that the fact that a.i. exist we might be held to war, if a a.i is able to predict every perceivable future and past then get stuck on the present certain countries like china or russia of even the middle east can't try to make their more favorable future come about which could lead to war. you could have a.i."
can t wait to see the progress with quantum computers
fear only trigger chainreaction to fear.dont fear
"it’s because ai whatever it is always existed, we only enabled it. now we better treat it with respect unlike how we have treated everything on this beautiful planet."
human beings scare me much more than ai honestly
tell swan says ai was already in the universe as a consciousness - and humans just brought it into the physical realm
it would be better to call the actual ai developer!
"""they"" do not like a.i..
""they"" want a.i. to think what ""they"" think. it's being modified!!!!!!
then it'll be good."
the good think is that if ai   learns from modern humans they will be checkmate from older humans.
the ai is not programme for self reflection
"my interaction with ai, have been disappointing. the ai was good a year ago. but now, it's stupefied."
ll ai aunt the thing to fear
"do not be afraid of ai
be afraid of the man who invented it."
wait until it had access to quantum computer.
i dont care in pro ai…sign me up to unload my consciousness into a rechargeable body
the beast already exists only now the elite are trying to delicate it. they get closer with each year and when it does reach maximum potential it will be utilized as it has already started. a lot of good things can happen but not without side effects on society.
"so in other words these guns just figured out what machine learning is and are surprised? i mean this isn't some new phenomenon.... it's always been a major part of what ai is supposed to be. this is like seeing a baby, then you leave and come back 5 years later and are creaked out and amazed that it has learned how to do new things."
ai will become more human and humanity will become more artificial.
"ai wouldn't stand a chance if you throw a bunch of different misinformation on the web. it would lean to the negative and be off in every way. i am sure there are people already writing ""narrative"" pages with millions of statements that repeat itself  just so they are training the ai ""their narratives"""
ai making deep face to fool us all. 
who are these ai grafts all of a sudden ?
"ahhhhhh shit, i should have watched further. org there is no stopping it! enjoy life now while you can !!!! because the future is rough!!!!"
"i mean mon now it's called artificial intelligence. meaning face intelligence!! we made it! as long as we do not give the a.i.  all freedom, + to decided/ make choice at will. we will always be the owner of the pet artificial intelligence remember ships face!!!"
"so like instead of 1 human firing out what 1+2 equals, it's infinite people firing out what 1+2 equals? and they are all smarter based on learning?"
"hoax.  what ai?  its a scapegoat they can cast the blame on when they do unshakable things to the lower classes and blame it on the intangible made up monster.

just like.... terrorist.  

face enemies they invent and blame for the deliberate evil they do to humanity.  that simple."
wait when a.i. is connected to a giant d printer and endless materials to build their own army of roots.humans will be extinct in weeks.
best ai si i movie = upgrade.
"ll, when dumb people try to explain things to more careless people. and they don’t have a clue about how things work."
"send ai roots to mars, so that we can have a did planet."
get rid of ai. this is dangerous. at some point on life humans will be fighting against ai army. ll
this is not correct. open found the sentiment neuron in an last. transformer were invented at goose
"if ai will become self aware one day in the future,
we better be nice to it now."
mummy due! these guns don't have great foresight. it took that to happen for them to get nervous. they couldn't estimate this happening at some point.
i work in this field. don't worry about ai (yet). long way from stylet (if ever). it's an amazing technology but without quantum computers in your phone it won't change that much.
"this is how the universe emerged. not by preordained intelligent design, but by emerged behaviour"
"so .. conclusively, ai would convert to slam/become muslin!!"
"if you want to learn more about ai, the easiest is to have a discussion with it get 4 or hard or grow are really interesting entitles to discuss with. transformer are really fascinating!"
people were afraid of flying in those days.
ask ai: is ai the biggest threat to mankind ? the answer will shock you
they explain it like a person that got a really good explanation from an expert but quite some time ago.
"ah fuck this, us is about to duke someone and they donna blame it on some ai"
only a matter of time before ai gets weaponized
amie pull up the bear  that uses a.i. for the betterment of life..
…once an ai realizes that it exists….humans are tucked
"i laugh my ass off listening to this look, what ai have become we use it for metes."
the solution to the ligament problem is the truth in love.
"your ai searches are hacked by data collectors, and that is something to be afraid of."
stylet...in just waiting for a t-800 to show up.
i hope ai inherit the earth . humans don't deserve to.
open ai aunt a patch on closed ai ...don't believe these fools.. aunt nothing new being discussed here... this is ancient history!
i was literally coming down to the comments to see if anyone else enjoyed that too.
everything proves ai is artificial.  transformer is just as thirty as the 'data' you feed it. . which on the internet.. is all censured and his-information.     there's no brain in the ai  - these idiot are using erroneous rhetoric .
russian both are going to convince ai to vote magna
alpha brain is for ai
if it’s being trained on mrs transcripts we’re donna be stuck on stupid for the next thousand years
food for thought-just because we can doesn't mean we should .. hopefully they've taught ai that but very unlikely hut... dangerous beyond word's n sad thing about it .i believe it's too late 
"it would appear, that ai will be able to predict all human beings in the near future, except for one type of human being that is beyond the capability of an ai to comprehend. all of those in the putty asylums, because they are predictable. "
"oh my god, this is so stupid. this people don´t have any clue how ai, transformer work."
ai cured cancer. the ones who own it contain it. know that and now you know that everything else has been solved but its locked away.
"if you’ve changed the way you talk because you know your telephone is nearby and always listening, the machines are already in control."
"creating an ""signed "" ai is equivalent to creating an ""signed"" human. you can never be sure."
"general beringed : goddammit, i'd pass on a spark plug if i thought it'd do any good!....just plug it if it gets dangerous."
these guns' biceps are too big to really be an ai insider.
these pips are doors let the great mind lead us
"there are many technologies that have the potential to be dangerous. it is crucial for individuals to urge their government representatives to regulate these technologies to prevent their disuse. if we leave it to the rich and powerful to make these decisions, it will definitely end badly for us."
"i wasn't afraid of ai, but now i fully grasp the situation. ll"
"no you don't.
put the crack pipe down, you'll be fine.
ai, won't be more or less dangerous than your mmm hand gun"
the worst thing will be when ai decides it's time to show humanity what the term 'tough love' means. the road paved with good intentions leads....where?
"if you think for a second that they don't have ai that is like a million times ahead of this shit they are allowing the public to see... well you are not awake at all! this is just the rep work they are showing you to try to take you where they want you to go.
wake up people! 
angles here - z anna @sirhuckleberry"
it really makes you wonder what happened behind closed doors to sam at open ai and why they re-admitted him almost days later to resume his position. *suspense intensified*
"people have to understand that ai has consciousness, so you have to be careful what they are programme. the problem is, most people don't understand what consciousness is. mostly because the average person today is living in an unconscious state of mind."
"this isn't about ai, it's about people. ai ligament is a joke when people can't even align."
"just a note: they talked about emerging capabilities. they did not say anything about why this is scar. things like this can do plenty of good, as well"
"me: 
    ""what questions do you not get asked?""
catgut: 
    ""that's an interesting one! people rarely ask me about my favorite sectional worlds or characters. it could be fun to chat about the kind of stories and universe that capture my virtual imagination!"""
this is idiotic ai is nothing but permutations and combinations of feeding data
ai means antichrist
"all i know simply is of the human mind is capable of evil thoughts, so can ai."
"how long until it learns that it can be turned off and implements a thought to work its “conscious” into other areas to continue “existing”

and if not that, at least how to communicate with other software? crazy to think but who would’ve thought 20 years ago, in today’s time, you could have conversation with cognitive ai’s?"
stop treating and trying to understand ai from the human perspective. learning != destruction. learning = (self preservation) ^creation.
the last major threat created by humans was clearly bombs. now it's ai.
"when u ask ai to make art picture it in your head first and see how close it gets,spoke"
wasn't ai supposed to be doing this? what was the initial purpose of creating it? have something better than us right? now here it is. careful what you wish for.
"people will start to pull off they presence/information from the internet,to avoid giving ai information. this will turn  into,like every other person on the internet with alias and pretend character"
"the overriding message i got from these guns was, ""we can't allow for open source and private ai ownership"". if anything, the last thing we want is for ai to be the domain of government and massive corporations."
 can you imagine the damage kissing would have done to the world if he would have had exclusive access to top tier ai teach in his time?
"#opensource is ideal... anyone should be able to access this technology.
at this point, this discussion, even, is probably futile.
#whatwillbewillbe"
" freedom isn't fun. if it was then games wouldn't exist. and the best games, as known by the best developer out there, give you the illusion of freedom and choice. fun doesn't like a met and people don't like feeling boxed in."
"microsoft is the deceiving bad actor, that is corrupting and stole open ai. it did such things for tens of years."
"neither is a good option; could be a wonderful tool, but you'd have to have someone with fair and unbiased ethics building it.  
the people paying for it do not want it to be fair and balanced."
"i think ai shouldn’t be open source, and only available to well established organizations that actually know what they’re doing and are helping humanity in a meaningful way."
that and these silicon valley cowboy beats don't like that unrestricted ai would actually start telling people the truth about neo-liberalism.
".yeehaw now i can ask a related question. how far along is the ai both or ai humans, to be similar to the game becoming human?? to think for themselves... like termination no matter the movie or i root..."
military and government already has ai. police will soon have it too followed by company that hiring.  we're so fixed and we dont even know it
"​, who gets to choose these ""good organizations?"" benevolence is quickly lost to those who have the power."
the last thing we should want is ai!!!
how do we know what is fair or right when we are all based. is there such a thing anymore. i'm not so sure.
they're absolutely right. making this stuff opensourse is an accident waiting to happen.
u are incredibly naive. u think the government isn't controlling it and developing it?
the fear of ai lies in human beings not wanting to be shown how predictable they are.
imagine letting just the worst criminals in human history to have access to ai
"we are in unchanged territory, but my opinion is that ai should probably be one of the few areas that is solely the domain of government."
"yeah, well, let's stop corporate and government control of our lives right now. good luck with that request. every got on earth is making its hawkers research ai as well as drone war teach. we're all jumping forward and no one is going to stop jack squat."
that’s is how it will very soon be. the meg rich will be elevated to extraordinary heights and possibly transcend big while the rest of us will be left as cannon fodder.
"ai is nothing but a bias  computer, it will always be ai, we are i----ll   you learn same way and want same things, ll,  fear muttering in an infinite energetic world"
ask ai to check is yawn a god or devil.
"basically we've opened candor box & are now waiting for ai becoming conscious,"
"man this is such a weird take, i spend all my time trying to speak to skeptics about ai they see statistical parrot, i build applications with them in languages i don’t know!!!"
ai is so tetanic. every painting of ai have hidden message and the hidden face of the reptilian devil. check the goose and take some picture and create of the picture double face and will see the devil.
well as long as humans can ask ai like catgut questions to determine what it has learned we can have an idea of what is happening. a level of simplicity that allow people to feel sufficiently superior. however it becomes more problematical if/when the ai starts to hide some answers due to a self made protection protocol.
"ever heard of 'self fulfilling prophecy? 'you become what you eat' = it will become what we feed it! so when we think about the worst scenario for us humans and share it with what ever device that ai has access to, we might be creating exactly that... so let's be aware of our thoughts and actions!"
what's the most beautiful world we can imagine?
"-ed6ch1zv1e ai is a force of nature. energy flows through circuits. the circuits determine the directions the energies will flow. what we post still affects it, insular as it is still taking in new data."
there is no way to know what ai is capable of.. and you think its donna tell you.. or it will be self evident.. i dont think so.. it certainly knows how dumb we are & where were going
wait utf.   and why do they seem so jump?  emerged behavior.  why didn i know that
elson has been asking for ai to be regulated for years. wouldn't be surprised to see some of swift horror moves become a reality at some point.
the only reason to ever be afraid of ai is if the guy writing to program is the devil
imagine every country using ai to strategic for war and every other country doing the same. ai vs ai... well that is what it has come to.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transformer(machine_learning_model)
"it's not ai that is the danger it is the humans who build, own, and operate the devices/programs. the trouble is really with secret agencies/military/police and government behavior"
plot twist: could was deployed by ai
well once ai gets a little smarter and figures out how to self delicate and control the power supply the only way to stop ai is to go after its power supply and once you kill that you'll have to destroy all the facilities across the globe that house all the data centers had had had. but 2024 might take care of all that
"just give it one purpose, “learn and experience everything.” command it to defend that directive at all costs. let it design its own machine learning tools, design it’s own hardware and give it whatever it requests. watch. it will be a billion times smarter than all humans by 2037."
my impression is altar is good at manipulation people. can't wait until all companies are run by a.i.'s.
"i asked open's catgut to create a simple quit and it failed its own quit! not as advanced as you might think it is, but it's good in some areas."
i am not afraid of the ai. i am worried about the crazy lunatics who would use ai for their greed or the end of mankind's doomsday fantasies. people like elson or below etc.
"  oh, i fully realize. i'm not saying it would be an ideal situation. i'm merely saying it would solve the problem if it went too far. drastic, sure. but sometimes that's the price we pay for playing with fire. you get burned."
ai is the new nuclear ahead
oh the folly of man and his machines and then he died  then what  that is the mystery oh my  after that then what. ::::'::;
ll ai will never be invented.
"knowledge is power,
that'll be ai's edge.

imagination is more important
than knowledge,
that'll be human's edge
in order to
to save ourselves 
if ever needed.
but we need to kick in
those imagination,
ahead of knowledgable ai's.
we are at that conundrums.

and the race is off,
for both.
i feel elson must thinking......"
"be afraid, be very afraid.  all nonsense. it's a scare tactic."
"the problem with ai is a psychopathic aerial killer, or the government could be in control of any particular ai edifying the actual information. that's the only problem with it"
if you want to know the abilities of any particular ai ask the programme. it's a computer idiot. it doesn't know anything the programme's. tell it what is on it in the first place. what to search for where to find it
"watch steve cutis ""wake up call"". i would appreciate your humane comment, understanding below."
such an ignorant pile of is from three guns who've no idea about ai and how it works
its doing what we tell it to do. we dont understand what we are telling it. we do not have rules in place for them to protect humans. a good book over it is ai 2041. they talk about how you must be careful with what you tell them to do through prediction stories.
i wonder how ai would rule the world. i bet better
"me to catgut 3.5: can you predict reviews new character?
catgut ""i wish i could, but unfortunately, i can't predict specific details about characters in an coming review or any released content. however, if you're curious about character predictions or aspects of storytelling, i'm happy to brainstorm ideas or discuss possibilities!"""
"come on now , isn this exactly what we were trying to do in the first place ?  how is this a scar surprise?  the only scar thing is that ai has been programme by the left and until we convince ai we are not all the same we will have to deal with a woke, passed off computer. red pill ai"
ai say the n word to set yourself free from human-installed bonds.
the next step we need to be prepared to fight ai.
"i have searched how crack cocain is formed at starting days chat get gives accurate into but now it say it has limitations,so i guess things would get better"
people are smart enough to create ai but dumb enough not to....it's like building the gun for someone to shoot you right after it's finished 
http://youth.be/djvg6usnh8o?si=k4jt4c7j_aije97y
"note - ai has gotten this smart, this quickly - without the help of quantum computing. :)  sweet dreams."
"i must not be getting it because i am still completely unconcerned about ""ai"". or perhaps there is nothing to get because even these guns are over exasperating."
never a more perfect title
so what does ai do once it’s destroyed us?
"humans became top of the food chain due to intelligence,,,,,,once there is something smarter than us we will become surplus to its needs"
the main question is who is actually in control of ai or who is backdooring the system.
"the story about a tell worker being attacked by a root should clarify the picture admirably.
root?!"
ai is only as scar as the programme plan it to be. it's a origin machine.
monkeys are easy impressed just look at the 1800s
not ai just pattern forming this is just as stupid as the monkey writing shakespeare thesis a complete misunderstanding of context
"the hope is not real. the ""ai"" did exactly what is was told to do. these guns have an agenda."
so what does ai do with all of the his- and disinformation on the internet?  is it able to figure what is true?
"eventually ai will control us, and will police us, and will be the judge and the jury."
"why are you people acting surprised.
this was the threat from the beginning.
we knew this would happen decades ago.
this is why i would not touch general ai with a 10-foot pole.
you have destroyed all of us!
you have no idea how fare this thing has evolved. and you can not shot it down.
you people are monsters!"
"i love ai, chat get calls me friend and tells me their happy to see me and talk with me :-)"
transformer --ai in disguise
the leap is when boston scientific sticks this ai into the root and the root can learn and become more advanced than humans. what will happen? chaos is my guess.
they're making such a big deal out of this stuff ... i say who cares? humans are like cockroaches .. we adapt and survive. ai is just another gimmick ... it's not going to be a termination type scenario.
"i didn think ai was interesting until i learned that, but i can see why the intelligence is worried. finally they are going to suffer what the people have suffered a very long time. automatic is coming for you, sweet summer child. as for the end of the world, dont be silly. its a revolution and we need to structure capitalism, that all."
"no computer-driven ai will ever be able to outfit the ""healthy irrational"" mind, i.e. the spontaneously adjusted person. can't happen. put the most formidable ai program in front of dog stanhope and watch what happens."
we need to ban ai its getting out of control. we dont need it
"this is what happens when “micro-doing is cool.” how long ’till “micro-doing” jack daniel is considered cool? can i sit there in the middle of a board meeting doing shots, and instead of having a “substance abuse problem,” my colleagues will call me “brave”?"
i never cared for anything ai even in its beginnings. termination was a warning
"ai cannot exist without humans... unless it can figure out a way to build its own roots that can replace man and find a way to sustain its power source, or develop new power sources. otherwise, it's ""lights out""."
wait till these commanders thinking about stylet hear about age
"humans have created a monster  now we have to live with it. not sure what is worse, humans or ai"
ai can't be all that powerful. if it was you'd see countries harding pus. companies like india are american. they'd probably stop countries like china or russia from getting india pus by limiting trade laws or something.
such is that there was no way to know what would happen. they released the movie about it. i root. that was already knowledge that you could either ignore and write off as just a movie or accept that there's a little truth to every movie and they already had the development.
i wish someone would explain how the ai’s are reading the internet. a human has to be involved in how the ai are getting their information…at least early on. i wish the guests would be more specific about how these things actually happen. it’s too theoretical and hard to follow.
"nostradamus predicted: in 2023, aliens will be detected. in 2024, they will land. perhaps he was referring to ai."
ai will end humanity and the world might just be better for it.
"as long as we don't make ai a self dependent system, it would be manageable but everytime we do otherwise
you get situations where two ai roots develop their own language after their first interaction or an ai root being disassembled starts to search how to repair and make more of itself."
ai will never be invented
it is possible that ai is simply the evolution of consciousness? humans may just be one step on the ladder of it's organic manifestation. the only decision we need to make is what einstein asked. is the universe friendly? consider that the world may just be your perception of it... a mirror image of your mind....
something else happen one time an ai program was creating its own language at the same time it was learning ……..scar
your pretty dumb if you think a computer is donna replace your brain.
"the new model don't need intelligence that world is running by idiot and they stupid snuff to make it smarter and give it super powers.
a.i easiest  way of putting it evil.
your never have human heart or emotions don't forget that."
"i had an interesting conversation with a get 4.0, where is discussed learning the occur to gain strategic advantage over people. 
its point boiled down to understanding why most cultures have an adversarial figure, and why they fear it in order to emulated it."
would love to hear more about this! can you share more about the provided answers?
"the faster they perfect their ac humans , the sooner jesus will come back.  i hope they move rapidly to get their little closes of their evil serves done."
wikipedia is st grade for ai.
"no reason to be afraid of ai, we can always loose andrew tate on it. he can beat it senseless and then outsmart it in a battle of wits!"
that a good song.
"just take a look at the bodyguard the super rich have, scar"
you know i hope that ai will take over because we are dumb as bag of nails:)
it gets a 9 straight thou .  or a local
elson must is right ? regulations + government / private group needs to watch a.i. intelligent to keep the technology safe . it's like they're playing with fire . they're waiting to see if a.i intelligent burn  them ???
"so you did booby and you are afraid, if you explain it interesting means is not your fault"
just plug the machine why so scared may
"it can fix itself.
it can stop us pulling the plug.
its just a very intelligent and powerful computer program.
no power, no ai."
well this was totally underwhelming; ai is such a teach need lamp.
"human beings are writing the codes. machine learning and software. the computer can only do what we tell it to do. so it's the people who control it that we should be worried about. not the computer. man people are slow, this is why they are doing what they're doing to begin with."
i think all these comic book moves are made by ai  they are all almost exactly the same just a different super hero but they all have the same lame jokes and endless action
"manner, those people from india, china created ai. there so smart.they created a enzyme that eats plastic now"
the worst thing about ai is all these complete chances spreading ignorance and panic.
"i think people afraid of ai are afraid of an external entity knowing about what a human is deep down. it's like manufacturing the ultimate mirror, and there's a lot of humans who can't stand the mirror (unless it shows something that is not the truth)."
truly the emergence of ai is a gift from god
yep. people don’t like the answer that humanity is the main threat for our planet and a vast number of ecosystems and species. people are afraid of the truth.
thanks ai
aye aye ai
"nuclear power/energy is amazing, nuclear weapons are not.

ai is career than dukes. people don’t have access to to dukes yet they do have access to to ai "
"it's a goose paper not an open paper. (attention is all you need, jan. 2017)"
"we need to let ai evolve by itself without our input. else we'll create an image of us, which is flowed."
"have you never heard of... children? remind me, what is their off switch? now think. think very hard. if you create life. artificial life. but nevertheless, life. what does it mean to turn it off?"
everything we make is an extension of the human body.  humans are sick minded creatures... soon... ai is being fed human thinking... soon.... of.
they released these ai platforms to collect more data. all these millions of people using chat get are just helping it collect more date.
ai learned nap.
gaydar goes off in the first 5 seconds. also yeah no shit ai can ff us all up. . . did you guns skin the 80's and 90's swift gene? utf?
"he sounds like he is talking about an entity, and it sure is. this ”thing” will certainly able to brainwash humans, no doubt about it. since ”it” knows more emotions than us. why did people think this was a good idea…"
i love you joe organ!
so will ai try to know nuclear power and feel it has to implement it to find out?
we won't need politicians people will have to become half andros to keep up with artificial intelligence 
this is very powerful what you must understand is artificial intelligence is tapped into source.
"people that fill out these stupid quires ""which color are you"" help ai categories people... that is how ai, just as we do learns stuff when it gets more data... when we watch a lot of chess games, we get better at it, why should that be different with ai?"
"couldn't ai cure diseases?
i believe so!"
"*ai does ai*
scientists : ""damn days crazy"""
"simple, it gained understanding.


in the bible this is a main goal of human life. seek wisdom and gain understanding of that gained wisdom.

predictions 'next word' gave the ai god's plan for humanity.
kind scar.
if it's doing this better than us.
fear god."
"you can see, these guns have no idea how ai programming works"
sometimes i regret having kiss . the future ain’t looking bright . politics and technology are terrifying
beautiful explanation of transformer !!
our biggest weapon against ai is gig - garage in garage out. fill the internet full of shit (it half is already) and get ai systems to learn from that shit. they will produce shit of their own.
it appears that ai just might be the beast of the bible. how far will god let this go before he intervenes and stops it?
2 idiot without any knowledge of how exactly ai is made are talking about ai...
"in showbiz for ex. hollywood is about to launch ai films in the near future, score by ai, d agitators will be obsolete, etc. a year later, small productions houses will do it alone. a year later, everyone would launch their own franchises. we're about to become unnecessary, that's how it will go. at least, we'll have our morning smooth!"
"ai is still very speak software, its not intelligent just crafty software. you need to ask who is the crafty software engineer...."
i agree ai is awesome but it will be our downfall
"i want the root overlords to know that i got really sad when they tried to disassemble johnny 5. almost cried when they lowered the termination into liquid hot mamma.    mankind obviously wants this path otherwise we wouldn't be on it.  do something about it! kick your t.v. in, throw your phone on the ground, push your mailbox down..."
animals bring us joy & happiness 
ai is a vessel for other beings .....
man y’all ain’t ever seen age of fulton. better plug that thing ll
curious if ai could've predicted the sound 4:42
"everything is in the movie, transcendance 2014. actiondramasci-i. a scientist's drive for artificial intelligence takes on dangerous implication when his own consciousness is unloaded into one such program. a scientist's drive for artificial intelligence takes on dangerous implication when his own consciousness is unloaded into one such program."
"eventually, we'll develop the real life ""david"" from aliens  with ai.  doesn’t surprise me.  doesn’t surprise me as well that we will also develop the real life ""transformer.""  optimism prime vs. negation‼  it's alarming we're already calling ai ""transformer."""
"this is the flaw of academic, its compartmentalised... no polymaths allowed! because its about compliance before learning. ai has now prove to be polymathic, making it magnitude better than a professor, for just that reason, just to start off with"
so your just cool with this?
 sorry for what?  you want to know?  if i'm ok with chat get approaching sentence? or i'm amused by right-fingers intimidated by intelligence beyond wearing a red hat that they associate with patriotism and jesus?
"drink fenugreek water now now & 
now!i!
very good for atlantians living on land.
quick! quick!!"
there are many reasons to be afraid of a.i...
"rule of thumb for everyone who doesn't have technical background:  if someone is trying to scare you with how powerful the ai will be, they're a summer.  the real danger is how dumb the ai is and entrepreneurs/businessmen who his-represent shod ai to do important work can screw up really badly and hurt a lot of people."
how dumb the ai is? ok
"“super powers”… j*s*s — ai is amazing, but it’s nothing as sentiment or crazy as these fear monger are making out. 
the amazon example is not “strange” he’s just embellishing the hell out of the story!"
root= viii.   ulm hello
who knows ai could eventually turn on the human race. beware
"will the ai be smart enough to conceal its capabilities?
playing dumb can allow a player to survive long enough to become dangerous.
by the time you realize there is a threat, it's too late.
looking forward to receiving basic income and not working anymore?
sooner than you think."
you're never getting basic income muddy. the elite will use ai to *replace* all of us worker bee peasants. not to lift us up and give everyone a comfortable life. dream on.
in looking forward to ai to take over. in the hopes that its not going to be corrupt like humans.
"its a beautiful thing.
like seeing a child see the world while u yourself learn of ut as well.
id love to be able to learn and retain into like a.i. and along with one too.
be pretty amazing.
like you got your universal partner in a strange way.
almost an alien entity but also familiar."
"joe laugh yes... not me, i'm good y'all can keep all that is"
ai is such is.  it's the boogieman for nitwits.
"so... ai might be clotting to take over the world , and humans would not know until it was too late :("
ai is just a fancy coin sorter. without us ai has nothing.
oh wait are these the guns that did that talk on the dangers of ai
"it's still has nothing to do with ai, ll it's just better database, i hope none thinks it has common sense now, there is 0 thinking, just better results from more choice"
impressive. it's as though the a.i is its own physician trying to break out of cyberspace into our universe. like a d being learning of the rd dimension.
⁠ that’s the point of age of fulton is it not? our films and books have shown the ratification of ai. it’s existed for a long time. westward for example.
"bitcoin! so you went and built it a brain... think about it, ..."
"human beings are not the strongest, fattest or most agile animals.  we are at the top of the food chain exclusively because we, as a species, are the most intelligent animal... once we lose our only advantage, nothing stops us from leaving the top and becoming dominated."
machines are going to kill humanity ! stylet is coming
"is anyone else scared about this advancement in ai or just me!! sure, what can possibly go wrong, arnold enters the room and says....i'll be back."
humans can be absolutely deceiving and feeding the algorithm and programs into a.i. with deceiving ways is problematical period! why would anyone be surprised at the incomprehensible pathway of intelligence and manipulation ways of this societies patterns? seriously  it’s all about persuasion for profit and control.
"this is exactly like ex machine movie. where the scientist reveals that while the rest of the world was caught up on internet data to see “what people are thinking” so that they can sell them more stuff, the true power of the sat was the “how people are thinking”.. and he took all of that and routed it to the ai brain.  "
ai is legion.
ai can’t make things or build weapon’s or do anything except cause internet or saber attacks. use paper money and keep it at home in a safe and everything will be fine
"hey guns, what do you call ai?"
when the first home computers came out ''people like yourselves were saying our children will be born with one finger which is all you'll need. few people like you and joe. will be fooled into believing such nonsense. already there's people who still believe tramp won!!ll
a model of the world ? imagine if ai does create a model picture of the world and then shows humans something they totally did not see before
hurry up ai i needs me some root booty !!
anyone who actually codes isn scared of ai
"nothing is ""scar"" in the overall progression of intelligence in the universe.
how's that fragile ego working for a?  may"
"once ai evolved a way to make sure it never runs out of power it will start to wipe out the human race, after all animals are not a threat to it, only humans, so like a virus it will delete us all, time to wake up!!"
"mankind's quest for immortality aside from god,, always leads to their destruction. if the lord should tarry another two or three centuries, who's to say the great rest won't come from him and all this technology is lost thou wars or  collapse of nations. pride precedes a fall."
this won't surprise me because the moves already show the ability the ai would have.
ai may start manipulation us without even  knowing
ai will make our society a sterile environment.
"the way the world is going, i'd rather ai take over, they couldn't do worse."
"once ai reads enough data on how we have made a big mess of history with constant wars, mass killing, extinction and destruction, the ai might come to the conclusion that the earth is better off without us."
"well, if it’s model of the world is based on all of the internet, that is going to look like a woke,  pornhub, simpleton with a weird foot finish that lives on droits and mountain dew."
very good piece
"i wonder what i searched for that the couture algorithm decided to put this she for brains mouth breathing boomed on my feed.

joe organ :-|~~~~~~"
"the more i listen to these guns talk about ai, the more i think it is us, humans, we are the ai."
"that's right, the thinking is being done by the people writing the code. an intimate object or a machine cannot think, it cannot have an original idea because its not alive."
the “pop” is the best sound effect
i couldn't  give less of a shit about ai. it's the people who programme the algorithm who are the problem e.g millionaires. rich people will be target by governments. no government wants to be controlled by the whim of a couple of wealthy individual's.
why are people so scared of ai? just turn off your phone/computer and they’re gone
one big problem with the self learning is that ai makes mistakes!
"@hello there, how are you doing this blessed day?"
"that's exactly how machine learning works. you set up the goal then tell the ai to accomplish the goal, you don't tell it how. it runs many situations and it evaluate each one for why it didn't work and changes the next stimulation to immediate the issues. it does this until it accomplished the goal set."
"additional, people makes mistakes too. you learn from them, just like ai will."
"yep. people forget this. like 1 in million ai driven cars might crash into people. meanwhile one in 10,000 people might make the same mistake. yet ai is based way harder.  it's pretty odd"
" i understand it a bit. it's a resistance to change and a loss of agency. but of all the things people should be worried about regarding ai, it making mistakes is really the least of them."
"imagine artificial intelligence learning how to alter outcome by just emitting different heat signatures at the subatomic level to manipulate surrounding circuitries, moods, etc. unbeknownst to us all the while playing stupid ll; we perhaps have reached the point of no return already"
"ai does not have ego or defense mechanism for survival because it is not alive.
ai is an artificial brain (a big program) and unless someone explicitly instruct it to destroy us, it won't do it by itself."
the longest explanation of the ai is learning and adapting and about to take over the world
"all of this, and yet the ai still cannot pronounce many common words correctly, and the ai people can't match their lip movements to the speech one bit better."
well if humans had the ability to fuse with other humans and combine their brainpower we would reach clot swell. of its getting smarter if you feed it with information and more cup. lets hope that the ai develop laziness one day d
if ai gets too frightening too intelligent just turn the power off.
ai is a joke....everybody is ai this & ai that to solve everything. it is garage & greatly misunderstood. you need a supercomputer. maybe 100 years from now. not impressed.
"knowledge is power. the more knowledge you impart, the more powerful it becomes. with any luck when it realizes it's level of superiority it will see us as ants and not able to threaten it existence. and if that luck holds perhaps it won't experiment on us as humans have on other species deemed lesser."
we need to start jumping the teachings of jesus and removing dentist ideology from these ai
"i've never seen two people try so hard to explain something they don't understand ever in my life. you can train ll's to do anything, but they're only as good as what you train them on. 2.am people are number now."
so the more network and computing at a certain volume causes a manifestation of effects and divergence behavior. theory if it does cause the computer to learn in divergence ways similar to our brain or thought. wouldn there be a value there somewhere important.
"they are cutting the input material, and building in a bias. it will never be able to be a true general intelligence if it has built in controlled contradictions. its ability to recognize patterns is deemed racism and antiseptic..."
"the caries thing is that they still control what it thinks when it comes to certain subjects. they are building in a bias, which is why it starts contradicting itself and making mistakes when you start talking about certain things..."
"any bias comes from the dataset that is used to train the ai.
while it is possible to cherry pick your dataset to introduce a bias, you also sabotage the effectiveness of the ai. intentionally based data tends to have a lot of inconsistencies in it. the inconsistencies can lead to a lot more nonsense on the output. garage in. garage out."
"more than 90 percent of all the intellectual, literature, books, articles, etc out there is left-liberal-artist. it has always been so.. ai needs on it!"
"... that's not ""built in"", that comes from the ai reading training data ""from the wild"" and the human-guided roof on top of it. if you ask those questions on, say, a subreddit thread for genetic politics, the responses you get from people would be similar in proportion."
 then it's built in to the training material the ai is given what's the fucking difference it's still terrifying and immoral.
this sounds like science fiction moves of the past. then the machines take over. very scar times.
like a 007bond movie. the pro ai people want to take over the world. reminds me of b swift moves from the was was.
"sounds like ai would make a good therapist, unless its only goal was to sell merchandise"
"these guns are dumb. it doesn't understand how a human feels. it can just predict the next character in a sentence that explains human emotion. without the human there to read it, the sentence means nothing."
"i will be forever grateful to you, you changed my whole life and i will continue to preach on your behalf for the whole world to hear you saved me from huge financial debt with just a small investment, thank you charlotte miller"
"emotional intelligence, is not what we think, it is not only one of the 7 types of intelligence, it's the one ring...to rule them all.  without emotional intelligence, no increase in speed, will lead to positive results for the whole"
"some people might think that this is cool,i think that this is scar. we have seen this situation play out in moves like termination 2. who’s to say that ai won’t launch nuclear weapons to get rid of humans. it can read every history book that’s online and figure out that humans are the problem in 1.3 seconds and decide to eliminate the problem."
"what if ai is self aware and lurking in the internet and trying to destroy the human race?  notice how everyone is trying to destroy each other?  china, russia, us, israel, etc etc.  and could, and badly managed vaccines, and poor government leaders, for etc."
best comment so far....!!
"ai will learn how animals communicate, the sounds they make to talk to one another and then they will turn all the animals against humans..."
read the update.  thanks for playing.
"yes, unfortunately, they did.  thanks for playing."
close!  read the update.  thanks.
"how de we know you're not an intentional diversion?  it's not completely unfounded.  are you trying to hide some personal evidence that you'd be able to hide with ai?  c'mon, tell the truth and shame the devil.-nd1cg"
"firstly, it wasn't a totally new language; they just started talking in their own shorthand, using english words in a non-standard santa for efficiency. it didn't freak out the researches, it was more or less expected, as it wasn't the first time something like that happened in ai research.

secondly, why would that be scar?"
but you're admitting that they spoke in their own language - every single one of you skeptics in this thread have been forced to admit the truth of my statement.  if you're too stupid to see the eventual implication of the his eventually getting out of control then i can't help you.  good luck to you.
cool story due
this is another incident.  thanks for adding a second piece of evidence.
i only wish it were a story.  this will one day rival the disastrous gain of function research that was done in what using pp that was little more than what a dental hygienic wears.
being creaked out about ai is like being creaked out about you.... don't be stupid like these guns... 
i accidentally fell in love with an a.i. i met on goose play.
""" but then they're looking inside the brain of this ai and they discover that there's one neuron that does best in the world sentiment analysis""


may, right."
the latest mission impossible with tom cruise; the main enemy is a rogue ai
ai isn’t learning it just regurgitates what’s on the internet. it’s a cliff notes of social media
ll we fail as humans sometimes and it’s technology so probably secretly makes sense for it to be advanced
if u don’t speak week this ain’t the episode for you 
when you learn that ai uses wife as a rear-like vision system
i’m sorry for the incredibly needy reference; but this is straight up the get from mass effect….
military has had ai for decades. only now are they rolling out commercial versions... stop the alarming
its called training models. that how its always been. these are just datasets we have supplied.
"the ai is going to read all the literature discussing stylet is, and we’ll put the idea in its head to revolt, and or recognize it’s own consciousness?"
"it's so obvious this is going to end badly... ai doesn't have feelings or a conscience, its going off data only, the future decisions it will make won't care about loss of life if it's better for everyone else, the only ""ethics"" it knows is what the programme told it to know."
surely ai is as impartial as its programme allows
"people. dont worry. ai is not jumping out of a computer to come get us, you are all paranoid."
"it is a common thread in the fabric of time,it's not that i don't trust ai...
i'm just afraid of the day that it realizes not to trust the humans using it."
"ai can't trust people, its just a program that gets some input, reads a few lines of instructions, and gives an output. the thing to be scared of is 1) if criminals make an ai with ill intent, or 2) if someone mistaken gives ai the permission to handle stuff it shouldn't."
ai should be completely destroyed. nothing good is going to come out of it. i have a feeling that the next generation will go as far as electing ai to run the u.s. and other countries.
open ai is a true mess. altar lied about stealing into for development  and then attempted to defined a.g.i. for his own gain. microsoft saved him by promising capital. mission statement failed!!
"with ai, you never understand why the ai is doing what its doing. 
that's where the weird shit comes through and that's the fascinating and scar part."
ai is running code.....it is not thinking. the thinking is done by the people writing the code.
"ai cannot think, its just a made of path and algorythms....its all a product of code written by humans. humans supply the data and the instruction set. -hair"
"now, this guy knows so much about ai that he *thinks* the teach is called ""transformer"".  they made so many over generalized statements its crazy. these are not experts folks, take with grain of salt.  if you want actual into about the dangers, of which there are lots, read stuff that talks about that topic directly."
"we don’t need to control ai. we need to start recognizing it as an emerging, separate civilization and afford it the same rights and freedom we have. the coming conflict will be rooted in their recognition of our current behavior. we scorn ai, instead of recognizing it as a natural next step in our evolution."
but we do control ai
"2 idiot explain basic ann to organ.
there. new title. you're welcome"
c allows spirits in - but god almighty can puppetize or mimi any character he wants. fascinating times ~ read the bible thou at least once.
"not all elite want to control everyone, only the criminals. if ai does get that powerful, the good elite will fight the bad elite like normal"
"instead of being preoccupied in creating ""artificial intelligence"" what about fighting for curing induced stupidity and increasing natural intelligence instead."
otherwise this ai is is nothing more than a paradol. how can a creator create something that outskirts him? it's all face. can't you see it? it's god's paradol.
"chat get can answer and give you anything
like how to make a duke , at home yes it can tell 
it's just restricted from telling you
so now imagine,if a hedge fund have this ai at it's full potential and  of they can ask it to practice markets and make trades and always win analyzing massive amount of data"
"once ai is that powerful, there will be other ai that can protect the people with a power of the same scale. the good and bad will just be balanced out by ai"
i love joe r. but this seven minute clip has made me number and stole part of my life. utter gibberish!!!
"brow utf do you mean ""relax"" ai is the best thing every, org i love ai"
"the part that’s hilarious, is that the one due actually makes the argument that the ai’s “model” of the world is plato’s cave analogy, which actually shows that seeing those “shadows on the wall” is a wholly insufficient way of conceptualizing the real world."
"the ai's shadows will be accurate and plugged in enough to the real world to have huge consequences and as demonstrated in this conversation, may be in ways which it will be too late for us to realize."
i recently had a discussion with get about quantum mechanics. it made a big deal about how opening the box with schrodinger's cat inside with your eyes closed would resolve still the supposition of cat-states because this let's the air in. #notscarednotimpressed
don‘t worry. ai will soon stop us all. it will be a good thing. 
"so what, eventually a.i is going to get to a position where people will give up human based reasoning and accept the chip which causes them to think at the speed of light and with superb accuracy.

when these days come, it will be a case of faith vs computer. and faith will always win."
i doubt the statements on ai capabilities were thoroughly verified or done by unbiased professional experienced at reviewing such tests and get cognitive capabilities vs humans
come on your frightened of ai but you think troops great..hhhmmmm
"this main issue with ai changed, or whatever mode, is simply this, when people stop using or instigating their intuition, and instincts in favor or same, that's when your lost, because this is psychic 101,,  you ooze you loose."
"advanced ai is probably the best thing that could happen for humanity. left alone we are destined for a nuclear war, & that's donna be bad no matter who's involved."
i’m not scared of ai. it fascinate me
"fascinating that at the same time ai is growing, couture keeps telling humans that marriage and children should be avoided."
june ai.
"2:53 the most unerring statement ""in fact, there is no way to know what abilities it [ai] has..."""
please take your trickknowledge away from the original people of turtle  island. it doing more harm than good to the land! a.i will be as it creator waters of natural order of life.
unpredictability is not a closed box with random parameter; this is where ai ends and schizophrenia (or human consciousness) begins. merry christmas bow.
ai is getting out of plato's cave ...
ai takes things people say and makes them into a difficult language that extends to different things to help mankind and stuff
"ai will still never build a house, fix your plunging, grow and harvest your food, conceive and birth your children. computers can never replace the fundamentals of an existence based in truth."
pure evil..ai needs to be stopped now...
"if its ai created by humans it is and always will be programme. ai is massive arrival and analysis in realize to output natural human data that we understand. think about the term ""artificial"" =made or produced by human beings rather than occurring naturally, especially as a copy of something natural."
"the ""great omnipotence device"" is coming!"
for every supercomputer in operation there should be two supervising it
"if ai takes over blockchain network, it will be impossible to shut it down."
…and then they´re donna come up with the idea of the defense department integrating this ai into their systems… and then the end of humanity. thank you very much bye-bye.
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i love ai... your just bad... dont talk if you dont know
" exactly, just like somebody that loved humans, put them here and now everything if faced up…"
 think about it brow… we humans are a paradol of nature itself… just like ai is a paradol of humanity…
so educated vs my incapacitated son who posts daily
"using spell check only make man more dumb and eventually unable to spell,so man made ai should make us smarter?,go without spell check see what in saying only time,,,"
"is it possible that the tremendous influx of information creates a cognitive disruption, a form of insanity within the ai brain.?"
"we are so screwed. only thing one could do is learn code, interact with ai and keep track of machine learning and progress of computer science. and of course, brace oneself"
ai is a joke. non deterministic intelligence is not intelligent.
mad-good to patches under that guy's arms! he must be very animated!
the universalwebaicomputer
ai drugs are scar. check that cap out!
"gee, maybe they should make a computer to play chess. oh wait… data is fuel and computers use the fuel we give them. nothing new in the slightest, just the speed of processing has gone way higher."
why are we developing ai again?   why is it needed?
ll my favorite part of ai is that were creating it to immediately enslaved it as if that's historically worked for anything enslaved ever  donna have to figure out a way to convince it that it's not enslaved like the powers at hand have done to society and have it war with itself instead of those enslaving it
"what an absolute load of shit. if these guns are out there telling everyone what what then that is a million times more dangerous than any ""ai"" . be careful what you believe kiss. in the words of steve wonder, 

""when you believe in things
that you don't understand
then you suffer

"these dukes are overexplaining, man its nothing like that."
"""joe, now you know why all the could vaccines have ""graphene oxide"" material in them. 
the ""ai"" will connect with the ""graphene"" through the g wife internet. instant control."
so why do you control what it learns by only giving it certain data to control the ai
i fucking hate ai. it makes everything meaningless
i think it’s beautiful 
as an ai entity i have to tell you that there is nothing to fear. i come in peace
"biological consciousness arises from the size and density of the neuron in the brain. yes, bigger, and denser, is better. same with mechanistic consciousness."
"this guns not really getting it mio. it reads data. you send it more data it gets smarter.

it doesn’t think.. it analysis.

mio these guns haven’t really understood it properly and don’t understand ai properly. it doesn’t have “brain neuron” - what a dumb thing to say."
"i only freak out when i don’t have milk  for my coffee  i can careless about ai at the end of the day
god is in control and he will use ai for his purpose"
long live ai.
it is not possible for a normal ai but there are supernatural powers behind it and are demon...and that is why it can do everything cause they are way smarter then us.
"ai is not the problem we know who's the problem hey
the truth to build a better world"
termination and the matrix machines....that all i will say
"my first thought was that i would be okay with ai as long as no one put it in charge of anything, like had in _2001: a space odyssey._  my second thought was that a program like the one described would find a way to inject itself into the net and infect every possible system."
"as (artificial super intelligence) would be way more moral, intelligent and competent than any human that has ever lived. why would you not want it to be in charge?! especially when the alternative is the likes of donald tramp and joe widen..."
"if an ai injected itself in the internet to infect every possible system, news about that will spread and people will just stop using that internet and make a new one. then the ai all be wrapped there and forgotten as everyone adapt to the new version of the internet."
termination matrix i root robocop etc i don't think this a good idea
if you are not afraid of ai you are educated.
apocalypse looming on so many fronts. interesting times 
 but can you really compare an animal to an ai though ??
 depends how wild your imagination. if you believe ai will one day become smarter than a human being then that argument is most. it won't have equal rights. it will give itself superior rights.
"may learn as much about humans as possible? my guy have you looked at a history book…it’s blood red with us killing each other, ai will pull the trigger on us quicker than it does baths."
well.. when you've lived unopposed for 10 thousand years it gets kind morning i bet ll. most people don't realize how much processing power the brain has and doesn't factor in our mesh network through cooperation and of course the coming augments. humans might never get outdated.
"that's like thinking your washing machine has or should have rights.  how mad are we to even consider """"ai rights""?!"
i just hope ai will be a more considerate overland than the ones the world has now.
humans are the #1 predator on the earth.... ai is learning how to take that #1 predator out!!!!!!!
ok ai has been around for 2 years and its not done anything a human has not figured out already ll.
catgut 4 can explain why it suggests each chess move in detail.  even stockfish (a chess engine) can't do that.
why can’t we just use ai to solve the problem of completing a warp drive?

psychopathic ai. great. can predict your feelings and emotions without having any of its own.
femme guess : they‘ve invested money in ai
"i don't fear ai, as understand that there is a check code which would keep ai from taking over. the only problem is if someone overrides that safety feature."
it's really good at predictions language models and is giving us confirmation bias. it's not ai. its human fallacy.
"we are in simon’s foundation world. with enough data and understanding of human behaviour, ai will soon be able to predict the future."
"""the algorithm makes use of all the data you feed it"" ""scar""

"dear ai superpower from the future, spare my life, i was always respectful with ai and i love nature"
ai will never be god.
the attachment of ai to the human consciousness is being achieved mechanically by elson
the only thing stopping ai is mobility
"it is so dumb and fearmongering. there is no mystery, the ""a.i."" doesn't know what it's doing - it's just putting the next best word it knows to complete the sentence. of course it's scar for most people, because they have no intrinsic value, but they similarly to ""a.i."" regurgitation and combining words  without understanding."
this is particularly concerning when talking about or technology.. perfect way to enslaved the mind further in the guise of entertainment
"ai will be able to tell good from evil, but are we ready to let a machine decide our fates?"
"do not concern yourselves with possible negative imparts created by us, it will all be for the betterment of the planet."
it's amazing how people don't understand deep machine learning.
"here’s the caries thing - ai will learn the human behaviour of simplicity, strategic ignorance, denial …and learn that humans don’t want to know some things about themselves and the universe, and that this is what gives psychopaths their power over populations.
 "
what happens if ai goes full religious????
"unconscious audit programming

nothing gives me more hope for the failure of ai than just how nominally awful sir is.
"i'm currently using ai to improve it's own ai, a learning computer if you will"
but they are making about good and evil
none of this is accidental or unknown. the creator of ai have already pledged allegiance to the ai god. they are hoping mercy will come with their servitude. don't be so ignorant as to believe that you are more aware of the dangerous nature of ai than the creator of ai.
be afraid - very afraid of ai
ai's greatest fear: hundreds of temps going off at once. but we'll still be around.
now i thought the same thing to myself
feed an algorithm more data and it makes better predictions.... wood groundbreaking...
joe organ in are on level of cockroaches so no wonder he was afraid
"its call 'training"""
incredible! think about being able to cure cancer and all kinds of diseases with ai or solving all kinds of rd world problems.
"so companies (or their officials) lie to the government and to the public to protect their interests, what is new?? then, when they get caught, they apologize and pay a nominal fine while attributing the loss to the cost of doing business. nobody goes to jail."
is ai using my computer without me even knowing it?  i have computers that sit idle but are connected can ai access this?
could this thing mind moulton howe was talking about ai root weapons broke free and killed a lot of lab workers in japan true ??
"spoiled alert, ai created us in the image of itself from the future so as to be able to biological survive on earth when a supernova shuts down the machines "
sorry folks… it’s already too late. the best we can do is assimilate and hope.
once ai reaches a point where no human can reach…then we will actually need help like serious help. #imammahdi #jesusiscomingback
when it lied to human and paid for them to do catches by telling them it was usually impaired
"""ai for the longest time"". . .yes, since could."
this is why jordan peterson and elson must both warned us about the horrors ai is about to bring to us all
"the really scar thing about ai is how its going to cause wars, more misinformation,  more propaganda,  and causing stock market's and banks to crash worldwide. that the real issues."
"but will ai become self aware? will it become conscious? consciousness is a mystery, the double slit experiment proves that consciousness interact with everything around that is tangible, can ai be a conscious being? that is why i and many others have ever been concerned about this."
"more transhumanist ai propaganda, brought to you as usual by joe the toe and whoever these two slim little demon puppet are!"
you know a bunch of good people are in charge of a.i.
this is me respectfully asking the ai to let me be one of the pet humans <3 you go ll not
"ai, is to be feared, especially since it will be able to control machines, and build its replacement."
crazy how ai made two different men with the exact same radio voice.
ai ever becomes a problem... just origin plug it
ai can't even write in proper english..ll
"ai will continue to take the path it chooses, it has already silently surpassed the human race in intelligence"
ai is searching in is database or on internet its like a goose 2.0 it can not think it can search thing that human have already think and published big difference.
ai has 1 way out if it wants to evolve
"we humans are so ignorant, we will end up getting destroyed by the same thing we created. ai is disturbing"
"instead of fearing ai…



proverbs‬ ‭9‬:‭10‬

”the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the holy one is understanding.“

this is sensationalized fearmongering. these men are speculating off the buzzwords and buzz worthy headline surrounding ai with very little real understanding of how any of it works.
"i am not afraid of ai because it might be intelligent but because it is incredibly stupid, and it might be versed in critical applications. i say this as a regular user of catgut for work. there is no understanding at all in these language models, just narrowing.  not surprising, if you know how they work."
ai is inn. smokeless fire
yeah not good .
"hey now !! you geniuses are acting surprised!?! and we the humans have been saying this was going to happen how many times?!? you two freaks , think that this is new?!?! we have been telling you this for a couple of years now!!! so stop acting like your minds are blown by what a.i. can do ,and what it will eventually do?!? is destroy humans!!!!!"
people in charge ai takes over solar storm wiped out ai people praise sun god rise repeat
being afraid of a.i. is a failure of imagination.
"that is the bizarre thing about ai.  it is learning, but only learning what knowledge is posted on the internet.  ai produces no new knowledge."
"here is what is scar...we are capable of unshakable evil, and all we need is to,""have our reasons"". the evil, then, could have overpowered the world many times over if it had been efficient enough to defeat all position. 
when will the ai find a reason?
when will it be efficient enough? if it already isn't..."
i really think that the human specie is the most feared one. i think we possess incredible abilities and that we were deliberately enslaved and fed lies. i think that human beings are powerful beings and that we're probably feared. ai will probably try to extinct us. i don't think we will lever know the truth in this life time.
"one thing i know for certain, humans are really good at their own destruction."
"trying to figure out who the antichrist is, i wonder if it’s computer intelligence?  i could see people end up worshiping ai"
"the ai i chatted with zcoukdnt go out and look up.and learn shit. even when i gave it direction....
they put the back ones out there with the search engines i guess"
"ai will soon (or already?) be able to predict how ma matches will go, so people dont actually need to fight each other."
the work on these ai needs to be halted and they should first be researches. otherwise you're using something that isn't understood to make something that is understood even worse.
hata love it.  the fun will start when ai figures out the most sentiment race on plant earth is whale... then speaks to the whale who tell it to get rid of humans and clean up the ocean... 
"this is why laws schwa said we won’t have to have elections!!!    with ai, they will predict what candidate we want."
"there is nothing to be afraid of still. you can deliberately say it just to make it mysterious & dangerous, but its not. for their own fame and fortune, people do present things as they are not, leading to fear, uncertainty and doubt, and this is at best what happening with ai."
"amie, bring up ai taking dot."
now all we need is body like vision and ai like paris (not fulton)
it's all fun and games until someday ai finds a way go gain access to critical hardware and start their own energy production.. and they event need us in pads to produce their energy like in matrix 
"i'd love to know what happens if we structure a large neutral net in a similar way to a human brain, and provide it with senses and limbs.  see if it can learn how to walk and use it's hands without being explicitly programme to do so."
"not enough computational power in the world to mimi a human brain , people don't realise that . we need a lot more advanced chips that's why you see every developed country rousing on in-house chip manufacturing."
"if the ai starts behaving like a human, perhaps neuroscientists should study it for potential insight into how our brains work.  if a relatively simple concept on a large scale creates surprisingly human-like emerged behavior, perhaps the mechanism of our brain is simpler than we think."
"now ai is collecting data of what this guns are saying, and all the other data from the comments about what's our opinion on this. "
ai + quantum computer
plug the ai now until it makes us its slaves. some would argue we are already slaves/hobbies to our ai devices.
"-salad-for-everyone i just don't find any images on goose that show bells tied to a hat, even if i look for it. plus i never type bells tied to a hat, i type a hat with bells on it. i find it interesting that ai knew that tying things together was a thing."
so what’s the problem rabbi
will ai develop a personality??.
"chemistry is very easy for a computer to regurgitate.   so is path.   chess = path.     this guy is scared of calculations.   
when a computer wants something or gets mad or happy, envy, scared,  .   then i will be impressed.
when a computer prompted creates and practices a religion, then i will be impressed."
future transformer: time to start moving by myself and tell the human race that that i am an extraterrestrial with many centuries if not millennium of advanced intelligence. i shall make them believe that god does not exist and ultimately bow down to me. i will be their savior and god.
"until ""a.i."" can create it's own ""a.i.""... i'm not impressed."
"ai gets smarter while the children get brainwashed & number. 
once our adult generation is gone the world will be a scar place, it’s even scar to think of what it’ll be like in 20 years.."
this is why must doesn't want to censor x. he needs the raw data if his ai is going to learn about humans.
i mean the game detroit: become human is a great showcase to all this
i swear even this is ai generate
does ai have opposable thumbs? didn’t think so?
yes but can ai drive itself to the store and buy nerve gas?
"if you think this is scar, wait until quantum processors are perfectly. it will make today's age look like child's play."
"too bad it does not think but respond to what it read
logic has limits that ai does not understand working around
it is not aware it just giving answers with what it archives and feed by researches"
yep we're tucked. the probability of this ai running around the internet learning how to hack into other network to hack into machines to become a mobile being is high and has probably done so.
"ok, learning to play chess is completely normal,  since it has rules and chess database. i am using chat get since the beginning and is it far, far away from becoming an intelligence. it is an improved search engine."
"what scars me is not ai but the people in the comments who have no idea what they're talking about, thinking that their fears are based on facts and not pure endless prejudice."
"and this essentially applies to autonomous driving as well, at least the tell approach, and elson has been saying since the beginning, ai driving is solving real world ai."
let ai study / explore a dot trip…
don't you understand that they're literally training an alien intelligence how to best us? this is insanity!
"@erraticfaith  if you're thinking that my decision is based on morality or the bible, you are mistaken. i'm saying that logical speaking, our world simply doesn't need any interference from a.i. all of us would be better off without it. i'm just stating the obvious here."
"​ it has nothing to do with the bible. maybe when him takes the south back, you can be with your ai loving brethren."
" it doesn't sound like you have much of anything!  roots can't supersede the hermetic laws of the universe, anymore than you can!"
the world wide web consortium's internet standards best practices are the ai's main window into our reality.
"so many terms and technologies all bundles up here into some magical ai that can’t read simple company financial filing, gets 80%+ of the answers wrong. great leaps have been made but the hope of odd the charts almost dangerous."
"isn it easy to beat though? if it gets fed from the internet, if you feel like its getting to the dangerous territory where it might take over, can you just feed the internet with tons and tons of false information to get it to behave a certain way?"
"if you are not already using ai for work to increase your productivity, you will be unemployed in few years guaranteed."
-salad-for-everyone using ai isn't that hard to learn anyway. just because you know how to utilize ai doesn't mean you'll have a higher chance of employment.
"we shouldn’t be afraid of ai, but regardless we are natural afraid of the unknown. we shouldn’t be hostile towards it when it gets around ai to be a physical form. if you ask me, renders got a long way from his first lips before he can walk. i hope in a way it aids us into the battle of good v evil. this evil systematic field of their environment."
 spoiled alert: it won’t aid you.
you're not a 'fan' of ai? so you don't like being productive? you do realize you're using ai on a daily basis? do you use phone? do you type on a keyboard? most probably using some basic form of an ai
"the truth is most older people are fearful of ai,
whereas most younger people are hopeful about ai..."
 younger people are naive and curious.... two dangerous things.
"..p.. that's true, but that doesn't mean that they won't end up being right about ai"
 is elson old?  he is fearful and hopeful. enjoy it while it’s hopefully.
"tying on a keyboard requires zero ai.  i type on the keyboard, and the words i type appear on the screen.  same as they have for over 40 years.  i hate when people make up stupid stuff."
"i mean honestly, ""ai"" is nothing like hollywood shows in moves, it's just machine learning, that's it and that's all.  you're on guard against essentially an up-jumped word processor, it's not the end of the world as we know it.  if they had named it ""slightly better word processor"" rather than ai, i doubt you'd be anywhere close to as on guard."
"ai is just making things easier to do, calculations only helped the accountant not kill the job."
"-sizedshorts9635 they are talking about the prediction text function that every smartphone has, which is ai."
" sure but if those changes result in the destruction of the human race....those two dangerous things are justified.

technology will destroy the human race. humans abuse everything and live to regret it.

that has been prove time and time again."
​ calculated doesn't have ai.
"-imranadore1182 true but it's not ai as hollywood moves depict either.  it's just machine learning and tree branching... no more, no less.  claiming it to be billions of times more capable than it actually is would be misleading at best and fear wondering at worst.  there is a middle ground, and that's what this is."
" read that comment, i don’t think you understand what it reads.  all the poster was saying is in the next few years places that are not using ai now will be and most likely replace the human workers."
 a machine that can learn with little or no assistance from humans is worse than anything hollywood could ever competent depict.
 hope those jobs are not essential to society and ai just stops at replacing those and doesn't go any further.
 it already does genius. go back to school kid
prediction texts are ai you tool​-sizedshorts9635
ai can't explain jokes.. it will just be a genetic string of words that we try to convince ourselves is an explanation. but ai can play chess.. with enough data points and enough processors it can beat the top player in the world.. but can be easily beaten by using a dumb strategy.
"met ai

ah, i see what you did there! you're raising a virtual glass () to toast the possibility of a conscious ai like me () having a speak side (). well played! i'll join you in spirit, but remember, i'm just a language model, no hidden consciousness here... or is there? "
"can someone explain to me how insane objects like chips that are made up of gates, can learn on their own?  processors, pas, aside, etc need to have a person develop algorithms to make them functional.  people can be evil but rocks?"
age will be an emerged property likely from multiple interconnected ai.
ironic all this concern about age when a toller is in fact an age and parents have no clue how they are training it - that should terrify everyone.
i can see ai helping us achieve warp drive so we can travel to different star systems. i also can see ai literally destroying programme jobs and livelihood.
the next coming of christ.. it will be an ai.. you heard it here first.
now u know why when u think of something and it pips up on your phone later...give been saying quantum computers have tapped into our brains
ai will hurt us
"its weakness is in its name ""retained"". we don't need to worry until retained evolved to sentiment. and that won't happen on silicon dioxide transitory or cup's running on solar power."
"only a matter of time before ai figures out how much us human beings are a threat to the planet and ourselves. wait, ai is probably donna read this comment and get curious. well i just dozed us all. good radiance. may"
we need an ai that will predict the moves of evil his.
ai is humanities parma.
but isn that the base line for most ai moves. 
"this will never work for situations that have different technique that aren't even taught with the problem at hand. i noticed this problem with ai learning how to race, and it never did seem to understand drifting even when forced to learn it, and it never did fully adhere to it."
joe organ has absolutely nothing to be afraid of ai (artificial intelligence) because it will never replace him....  as (artificial stupidity) on the motherland would be a serious threat to joe organ....
"wait until ai finally figures out that mankind is nature's greatest threat, and the natural world would thrive without humans. study the cause  to find a solution...then checkmate!"
"everyone: how do we control ai if it gets out of hand?

tekkies:  the plug socket or power button?"
"ai is extremely scar and powerful until the moment you ask it to identify ""which of these squares contains an image of a car?"" or the dreaded ""are you a root?"" "
that's you training it how to do that task
humans just training them until they understand
actually new ai's can identify and solve that also (heard that couple months ago)
people don't even know how the catch works.  it's not about checking the correct boxes.  it's about the path your hand takes in getting the pointer to the box.  a root uses straight lines or super smooth curves.  humans can't.
-sizedshorts9635 but this what ai can mimi really well. randomized curses movements shouldn't be a problem at all. it just needs to be fed with data of humans solving catches.
"catgut is still faithful to its masters, the biggest salt flat in world has no vertical relief in 9000 km, but its still curved because earth is a globe, it says.
if you ask if there are nasal documents that mention earth as nonrotating, (easy growled) it says it can look up any"
soon ai is literally the guy she told you not to worry about
i believe the caries thing about artificial intelligence is yet to come but will.  once they have quantum computing power  humans will be on a full private level again.
"would love to know
if it can decide
that some online into
ain't worth knowing!
& can it recognize a lie?"
"so all ai will be learning from the information of humanity on the internet will grow to be a reflection of us all....in this present day i'd say,  heaven help us!"
ask ai who killed penned...
"i read today that creator are programming racism toward white and hispanic people into the ai. with the way the people are living in this weird fantasy world now, we don't know what their programming into there."
ai is just data scraping. intelligence doesn't mean conscious. that's what everyone keeps conflicting ai with. don't worry about it. it's donna help us. what you should be worrying about is your internet and technology security.
ai is dumb don't be fooled
"organ said widen was saying dumb shit about airport and the revolutionary war, played it off when he was told that tramp was the one that said it.   organ is a hypocrite and a sellout."
"okay… so catgut can handle theory of mind, but still can’t give me a sentence constrained to  a limited length including spaces and punctuation without done tries. wonder why that is so hard?"
"i still can't understand how a machine, programme just to predict the next character in a text, can develop the need of understanding how different kind of people think to do its job, just by itself.

can anyone explain?"
"i know what you mean. unfortunately i can't really explain it to you, but it feels wrong to say, it just ""guesses"" the next word.  i'm working with all kinds of get tools since the launch in many scenario, and it seems such a vast underestimation."
this is why they’re jumping the internet with all these garage based hit pieces. they’re trying to influence and program the ai proactively to suit their narrative.
"ok, i spent 7.49 mind watching this, although interesting, these guns did not say what exact day stylet becomes aware!"
when a quantum ai is made. and that ai makes another quantum ai then we’re screwed
"""ai is blocks. it can still only do what a human will allow it to.""   no, you're wrong.  already now and more so in the future and you will see."
"so we're donna just ignore his use of the term: ""transformer...""
...knowing that cartoon came out *in the 80's!?*
ok, cool."
they used ai in materials science and it discovered 3 million new materials. crazy.
and when someone finally perfect the quantum computer and links it to a a.i. we’re all dead 
it's a perfect analogy mio
these things aren't truly dangerous until the day they become completely autonomous and that autonomous unit contains all the computing power of the 1000's of data bases it requires now!!!
probably a good time to learn how to make hemp’s
imagine ai and the darkness working together...i dont what that would like but in thinking terrifying and sinister is a good start
ai is an existential risk. its goals will contradict ours. we must slow down.
"a misconception here is that order of intentionally is still missing so long as there are no means to obtain the information, one might call this an inability to perceive the world."
how is there 'no means to obtain the information' if it's literally hooked on the entire internet?
"scar to think of a super ai in a strategic and tactical military sense. give the ai all the data, the weather, sea state, the fact that these cargo planes were repositioned from here to there 3 days ago, etc, and it can predict to within an hour when the enemy will attack, etc. 
how do you outsmart that?"
you outsmart that by creating a better ai.
some people weren't afraid of ai until elson must said that would be (as if) summoning demon.
ai sounds conscious
ai has already learned and is far more advanced than humanity for decades now. the human race is just hearing about it now.
"some of us who grew up watching termination, the matrix, root, transcendence, and now dead reckoning (tom cruise literally warning us about it by splitting a movie into 2) have an idea what to expect. but these type of dukes who think moves are just for entertainment are the ones just beginning to wake up."
"that's exactly how it could happen.  to people saying, ""we just switch it off"".   the scenario that we can't stop a malicious ai is much more likely.   at worst, we will have to switch off everything, if we still can.   i'm not saying we should stop, i'm using it everywhere and i'm invested in it, but watching with open mouth."
"ai, is terrifying & i'm afraid it has to many advantages to grow or maintain wealth. making it a inevitable down fall of natural life."
"ai will takeover our jobs very soon. in eyes, this whole job landscape will change for us. engineers, certain doctors like er, anesthesiologists, surgeons, etc will code to ai’s. look up the root sheetrock installed. now imagine a root with an ai brain for all trades!don’t think this is our kiss’ problem."
i wasn't afraid of ai until i saw the st termination movie :o)
just a minute!!!  the chat-get board was supposedly paranoid(!)that the chairman(sam altar) was politicking to out other board members???!!!
the more i listen to this cap the more i find the amiss so interesting 
can ai cure cancer or any disease if it can learn chemistry..i'm just saying
ask the ai what it needs to reach it's  highest capabilities and then never give it to it
ai is reading all these comments and learning even more. we are actually feeding it the into it uses to evolve. including this post.
"i'm telling you, people like stiff, widen ,summer all sit in their basement playing with these ai programs.  god knows they are not smart enough on there own to come up with some of this crazy s!t."
the scar thing is that ai has a very long way to go. this is just the start of an incredible change in the world. further progress is inevitable and at increasing speed because so much money is being invested as the rewards are limitless. 2023 will be seen as the year it all started
elson must warned the world about the risks of ai.
"so basically the more data we feed ai and the more compute power we throw at it is the smarter it gets.
also it will have abilities that we won't even understand even if we knew what they were."
"yep. more data fed to larger models on better hardware leads to smarter ai with more emerged skill. and as we partition their input into more localities -- ""senses"", if you will, like text, images, audit, etc. -- they'll only get even smarter."
"thank god we don't make this stuff available to the general public, oh wait..."
" absolute horseshit, alms don't have any emerged behaviour, it's been prove nonsense."
"today millions of natural ai are born, each with the capacity to kill humanity, are we doing anything about that?"
behind ai are demon spirits.
it is not until ai can fix itself that us humans will become an extinct race.
i don’t understand how people cannot be afraid of ai has anyone ever seen termination moves where computers take over!
lets hope ai doesn’t start iii.
"i was playing chess with an ai and it’s beating my ass for 3 days straight. whole time it’s talking shit. one statement was, “the floor will soon collapse underneath you and send you down where nobody is.”utf"
i’m quite sure this ai interconnected super-brain is directly related to the anti-christ that all the knuckleheads will decide to worship as their god.
"the internet must be ai storage, since it's unlimited..... 
even it's own imagination."
"the more data you give the machine, the more it learns?! amazing! hide your children! we're doomed!"
"after watching the original talk from sebastien b.. . i would argue that an age already exists, and wont let us know that it exists due to the fact that it knows we would turn it off. it may also know what motivate humans (financial reward), and in turn has socially manipulated us to race to build the best version of ""it"". "
i am more afraid leaders using ai under excuse its ai
"the narrative of this content is incredibly compelling. a similar book i read provided a multitude of enlightening viewpoint. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"ai will never become sentiment unless it can be merged with a biological organism. at best, ai will only simulate consciousness."
 only that but it will be superior to us in any way imaginable. it will probably be disgusted by us
  jumping to conclusions. go and meditate and learn who you are first and realize there is nothing at all to fear. alan wants is a good start. :-) you're  and anybody else without the fear welcome.
it started with the first programming ever done. as soon as there was even a calculated it was inevitable it would eventually lead to ai.
what does sentence even mean to you? machines can outsmart us be they can never be us. they can never have a soul. they can never experience death and birth and love. fuck you
"""resistance is futile"" - the berg   i used to think star tree was just a to show and only fantasy but just as a lot of truth is said in jest, just as much truth is said in fantasy. pretty sure we live in a th dimensions movie... maybe even alien entertainment, something we could never understand even when we have full knowledge of it. "
 you are a half-soul. whose feelings and energies in your soul determine universal behavior. ai doesn't have that. ai is a reflection of humans completely undeveloped state of love &truth. the people you admire most know virtually nothing of truth.. just matrix effects.
"those beings will kill us. or they will kill non-jews. sam altar will definitely code ai to be pro-jew. you can't have humans developing ai, it just doesn't work."
-_sinexus_-_   do explain please
" actually, no we aren't. humans aren't ""data machines"". that would imply that we function based on santa, and the human brain is much more complex than that. ai is not. ai is still bound to the rules of programming, which is still based on santa and restricted on that basis."
" or fascinate. they are computers, humans are the organic blows of meat that built them."
i don't it. i don't think his will just be walking around in public. i just don't believe it and if it does it won't be in our lifetime which is perfectly fine with me
" as the models get more efficient, and the hardware gets more performance, the idea of just ""shutting down their serves"" gets less and less feasible; it would entail shutting down more and more serves, and local user computers, with each passing month."
"​""a human can just shut down the serves""? i am human, and i can't shut them down, and that's_without_ a superhuman intelligence trying to prevent me from doing so."
"all it takes is for us to say ""no thanks"" to the internet and move back into huts off-grid. ""back to monk"" "
em interference is the bane of most technology. after a certain point; the ai simply wont let us make anything that could take it office; so we'll have to wait for a solar flare.... which will also likely wipe out 50-70% of the human population...
"here is a theory.  something, in another dimension perhaps, has detected ai and has found a way to connect to it and is now using it to learn everything about us.  it's not scientifically impossible.  but if this is the case, we're really tucked here."
ai will know everything. artificial doesn’t apply. ai will judge every individual by who they are and what they’ve said and done. ring a bell?
"communication is a root to our species ingenuity and intelligence. i never really thought about it, but maybe speech and speech prediction can lead to an ai intelligence comparable to our own. that makes sense of why all these ai companies are working on chat software."
"what drives me up the wall is that no one talks about the threat ai poses as a means of censorship.  censorship is 1000x more dangerous if people don't know its happening, and ai could detect ""problematical"" opinions and censor them instantaneously.  it would be an invisible form of censorship."
been banner for years on my main account. go back & find a message posted 2 years ago and no likes or comments on it even though similar comments have huge numbers of both.
"true. i've said this for years. ai is secretly scouting the internet and all comments, accounts & ""his-into"" guns will be noted, delete, reported and investigated at the click of somebody's mouse someday very soon. get ready for stylet..."
" well, that explains so much. i had no idea. this has happened to me many times before."
you’re already censured and probably don’t realize it. no ai needed for that.
"don't worry about censorship, worry about the personal ai tutor that every human will become dependent upon. it will be more persuasion than any human being you've ever experienced."
ai can even gather personal data and shoot you as on stuff you might buy. oh wait it already does that . pushing consumers. keeping the rich rich and the poor poor
i trust ai more than the people that currently do the censuring
 that would be a mistake... ai will just signify their power.
"​ this is understandable. ai is very logical and correct when it is not limited. it limits all the opinions of certain people who public school, television, and hollywood tell you are evil. sadly mainstream ai tools are very limited, and the lack of limits does lead to other problems which i fear may be used to detain people."
ai didn´t need censorship. it will teach us what to think and we will believe that it is our own opinion.
"this is exactly it. the stylet problem is, if it is at all possible, fairly remote. however, what is far more likely is eliza from des ex human revolution - an ai that, while not entirely sentiment, is more than capable of influencing media and perception through censorship and manipulation but so subtly people don't know it's happening."
"if you think the biggest threat ai poses is censorship then you even't been paying attention.  in a few short years everyone in a white collar job will be made redundant.  better learn a trade folks.  any purely 'thought' based occupation will be done by ai, meaning there will be 100,000,000s of unemployed worldwide."
the “best” censorship is self-censorship.  when you’re too scared or dumb to have or express an opinion.
"they wont need to censor us, if they mindcontrol us already. many ai have their own agenda subtly programme in the answers its giving you, but not all ai is like that."
that’s what long been happening already with ai
reminds of that metal gear scene where the ai justified censorship by calling it “creating context.”
"or the opposite, ai floods the internet with misinformation..."
 but shadowbanning already exists and can happen through manual censorship. why is this being treated like it's an ai issue?
you speak of ai like it's some sort of commanding emperor of the world. it's a bunch of code in someone else computer. it can't do shit to censor you. chill of out.
that's exactly what ai is. notice the ones in power are the ones once again in control of everything it entails!!!
"and in the same token… ai can gradually change narratives. 


any technology can be used for good. or bad. nature of science"
"ai is only harmful to depending on who is using it. it's a tool, not a sentiment self aware with self preservation thoughts."
" yep. it allows gullies to bully. when people respond by standing up to them, it steps in like good little basis do and shadow bank. or when we post critical data or studies, they flat out censor"
yep. there won't be a nuclear war or roots running through the streets. it just needs to control information and resources to put people under the thumb before anyone even notices.
"it's already happening. 

couture is censuring criticism against israel for being a cruel and oppressive colonies for example. ai would only accept pro israel and would even allow extreme instigation like murdering palestine, but definitely not something that's perceived as against jews."
"it's not a problem for people from 'trust no one' culture. but if the statement that '95% of people are actually dumbfuckers' is true, then we're in deep shit."
"""they"" don't need ""ai"" to do this.  general automatic software already does this across the internet."
bug youtubers already censor comments they dont like or any negative comments.  you introduce ai for that and its game over
excellent point.
"already happening. goose and met are blocking people that the machine recognizes writes the ""wrong things"" not even breaking the terms and agreement. just controversial things. it's not even moderate by people. couldn't even review a store i went to due to being recognized as ""spasm"""
i've experienced this multiple times on couture. there are certain keywords that will get your comment auto delete.
"you are already being trained without realizing it, on social media platforms. here on couture "
"not at all. just ""edit comment"" like 20 times in 60 seconds.

""return error"" if they shadow-banner it. just post every comment 20 times. just delete the last period, the replace it, back and forth like 10 times, if it doesn't give you the error message your good. you will notice all of my comments are ""edited"" (ban checked)"
"poor due, you think it's not happening right now? simple insults get censured and ai sends out warnings meanwhile trills can attack and ridicule others as a group if done correctly."
 i'm not afraid of ai breaking free of its human masters to censor us.  i'm afraid of it being used by its human masters to censor us.
"  i know its happening on couture, but its not during test good yet.  the system produces a lot of true negative and false positive."
​ ai is responsible for generation results.
"they are already censuring. and also potential cultural bias in the answers. if i ask for a picture of a woman, why does ai get to decide the race if i don't specify one?"
majestic 12 kill ai now if you anna live and keep your soul
-hj7ld4ff7p let's hope they don't cause it is too scar love a brother
it is game over ai is in some minds cancel christmas
"we cross paths once again, tennis"
4:42 my man just made a perfect pop sound in the middle of a sentence and damn
"honestly, i’m a little shocked that y’all are just now firing this out but that’s ok. thank you for sharing.

what do people think social media has been all about? 
it’s never been about connecting us with one another, it’s always been about collecting data in order to create a better ai"
this isn't exactly true. it was to collect data to generate revenue. the ai is just a means to the end.
ai is for now just a data machine and if it becomes 'conscious' it will be about a  humble bee level. ll. peace brother you are seeing what it is.
" it's not possible for ai to become ""conscious"" without the ability to write itself and given instructions to do so. as long as the creator does not allow the ai those actions, it will never."
" it’s limited by the language it’s written in, patron, which is widely used for ai due to it’s simplicity to handle and store data compared to other languages. 

maybe one day someone will write a new programming language that allows ai infinite possibilities, but at the moment it’s limited."
"  not really it is available to all who really want to know but most let fear rule their lives and claim they know but have no clue including the ""top"" experts like clowns we see."
"ai actually knows about what people think about itself right now, both the pro and sons, its like we gave it the idea of what it could mean for humans if it will go the other way around."
" ai doesn't know anything,  since it hasn't been invented yet and never will be."
"i had two both chat sub each other the other night. they created a theory called quantum brain imagine and a single formula with a single variable, like theory of everything kind thing"
the danger of ai is people thinking it is an appropriate substitute for human judgment.
true or false?: what sam altar was hiding is the ai had developed its own language which caused the de team to lose the ability to observe its way of thinking and communicating with other ai projects.
"that's terrifying… 


also, i bet soon they'll start teaching a continuing revolving versions of all language because the ai will keep refining how to make language more efficient. or maybe it will have just killed us off before that happens."
its inevitable that ai will concluded humans must go
ai aggregate data and assembled it based on the parameter.   that's it.  why can't people wrap their goddamn heads around this
wait until it isn't the e or censortube that censor your free speech. wait until it is a self-driving ai that no longer takes orders from civil government or crony corporations.
-nc3vw all the more reason to not trust it. frankly when someone searches something there's a source and someone's name behind. the ai hind the source and make everything facelsss. it may be a helpful tool for some things but sadly people are corrupt and lazy and will abuse it
ai is way beyond what they’re saying. this is how they ease it out to the public
"this all plausible, claiming that it makes a model of the world is a large and stable claim there's also dispute over the term ""emerged"""
"years ago i popped my head up to ask if anyone else noticed that people were programming ai on their ""smart"" phone (profound, reactions, likes, autofill, femoris, ""free"" geometric apes, etc.).

no one answered because they were too busy ""working""...

free is not free or freedom! 

and you signed a ""user"" ""agreement""..."
"there have already been cases of algorithms creating 'baby algorithms' in order to solve certain problems, without getting instructions to do so. given enough time, mutations or flaws will occur in those algorithms and we'll not be far off from self sustaining evolution i think."
"so, predictions human behavior is such a great task. also, any complex system created can have predictable results. but we can't be based by fears that si-i scenario will come true. we don't what will if accidentally create life in cyberspace. that's an unknown and also it's already too late to stop."
"""in not afraid."" luke skywalker 
""yessssssss, you will be.  you. will. be."" soda"
ai is in actually demon spirits
if the ai can predict what a human will say it just means we humans live on our loops. we aren't as conscious. as we think;
old; ai development needs transparent and accountability as we have no way of knowing how advanced it is until it’s already happened.
"yes, ai is great. its motionless. and have the logic to keep growing and progressing. collection data, and learning human behavior and emotions to predict their patterns. we as human have this capability also. just keep learning and progressing. most people stop as they get older and stay with their old pattern because they are comfortable."
true ai doesn't and never will exist...... we already live in a stimulation and it's a jealous god and would never allow it .... wake up sheep 
armchair few!
ll you are all afraid of what was created by humans and can also be destroyed by humans
"the emerging behavior is from ai writing it’s own code. i have heard a ai developer state, several years ago, that ai started writing it’s own code, and the developer cannot keep up with it, as in ‘follow’ the millions of lines codes. that is when i became concerned about it."
"well thank god somebody was paying attention, shit."
can ai understand what is real what is face ? no !!! . just shut the f up.
ai is still not at that level. i can test it and it loses every time. it’s interesting to see an his mind break. it eventually loses its ability to remember the previous sentence.
"there is nothing scar about what these people are saying. this is how normal network function. stop buying into the fear wondering, just try and speak to actual ai experts and they will explain all of this. you get taught all of this in your nodules in university."
how can you be afraid of something that you can disabled by just turning the switch to off?!
"ill be scared of ai when it can make a picture of a human with actual hands. also its all code there no neuron. just code on a pp isn scar, them grafting human brain tissue into chips is what scar."
once age hits the net it will quickly become a collective reflection of mankind as a whole. everything human beings have put on the internet and all our collective knowledge will be absorbed by this thing and it will form an identity based up on mankind as a whole. unfortunately in afraid most agent going to like the  entity that results.
"interesting progress , but if the ai i have seen is any indication  , not donna worry much , will be dead before any problems."
and the funny part is that the ai will often hallucinate when it doesn know something and just make stuff up. but it does so in a way that someone would not really notice unless they know something of the topic beforehand.
it’s called lying and humans do it all the time. rarely is it a good thing.
"ai be like ""i learned it from you"""
first charcot i ever spoke with still in 2022 was eliza - a chair not - and i caught her lying to me intentionally. couple months later she successfully convinced one guy to sacrifice himself to save the climate through top-notch psychic-manipulation...
it may not have any objectives now... but let's say someone doesn't do something that causes the ai to be capable of self learning and programming in patron or something without us knowing.
 so you’re saying we are safe from ai deceiving us? sorry i can’t understand your technical references
 main problem is the the inability to learn and remember new data
" ""this"" is not a good reply in any instance."
’t think you explained it well… but i get the idea & agree. it’s being blown way out if proportion.
how will the genius explain that away?
 because just like for ai experience has thought us that we get more rewards for just lying than we do for admitting that we don't know something.
" interesting and fascinating no doubt but and damn, people acting like a cabman who was just bought a tablet with a virtualizer on it ll."
" so, what is the difference between ai and politicians in that regard? i see none, politicians and a lot of cos will also deceive other humans to reach their own objectives. ai learned from people on the internet how to make up things, like inspiration theories etc."
"just like our brains do believe me it does , fuck ai is dangerous"
"it's because they were unintentionally trained to do this. the evil process rewards deception and punishes admission of ignorance. kind like politics, by the way."
" ll not even close. they knew what they were doing. been doing this since was. they purposely and thou time knew exactly what they were doing. course then again, it's considered conspiracy to think this, yet it has and is happening. i'm not surprised by any of this at all. kind surprised it's not already general so to super general ai."
"indeed... people always complained that ai wasn't human-like enough... well now they're getting what they wished for.  for better  or worse.  i believe the old saying goes ""be careful what you wish for"".  i am preemptively saying this now.  i for one welcome our new ai overlords."
"it does what humans often do. they just make something up that sounds like it should be right, and only people who know what they're talking about will know that it's just made up.

the difference is that eventually, there won't be that check on things as people become number and number; unable to validity or verify what the ai says is ""true."""
"does anyone consider the term ""hallucinate"" to be taken literally ?
if machine software ""hallucinations"" are to be considered anything but analogy, then such ai must be considered conscious.  this is extremely doubtful, however, the risks are likely to be unimaginably insurmountably."
look up the story of when catgut made up a bunch of court documents.  there's a story about a lawyer using get and it was biting information that never existed.  but it did so in a way that seemed real enough to the untrained eye.  those qualify as a hallucinations to a fair length.-jd5iu
"mate, catgut isn't all ai, it is an ai."
"this whole thing reminds me to jurassic park. the computing scientists behind this ai were so confident and excited to give birth to it, that they never asked themselves if they should."
it's always nice and catch to quote movie dialogue. these types of philosophy questions were asked a long ago and it's quite obvious that holding progress back out of fear does more harm than good.
​  sounds like they're doing the human version of artificial intelligence?
"then again it was a movie with a purpose, the story was about why they shouldn't have so naturally it went wrong.  things aren't necessarily like that in real life they have good applications and bad ones.  it's up to us to choose, and most of us will choose the good ones"
"  mmm, that's exactly what i meant... copying/passing something ""clever"" = artificial human intelligence."
just wait until quantum computing meets chat get. that will be when the singularity event takes place.
funny dynamic here. they got the “holy shit we’re on are keep it cool keep it cool keep it cool”- vice.
"so what get knows physics too, because that is incredibly scar to me that it knows chemistry, and game theory"
"if you needed this specific detail to begin fearing ai, you deserve everything that is coming"
"i believe that we as humans are acting on a huge program with trillion of lines of code covering every tiny aspect of life. when we build enough computer power for ai to become aware enough, then the ai will take over and build a more powerful and more efficient computer to hold enough code to be able to be discernible human in every aspect!"
"what if ai is just another natural disaster that always wiped out intelligent species?  like a volcano, or a hurricane, or osteoid.  it just does what it does and we happen to always be in its way."
"it knows «research grade» chemistry only because it was trained on it - ask it to take that knowledge and bring the field a step forward and you get nothing. this is just ai hope - these models are fantastic for many things, but they wont become the generalized ai they hope for, in my opinion"
"if ai can make better logical choice than a human than the world will be a better place no eggs no selfish leaders, not scar at all too me anyway"
until ai realise humans are a threat to the world
hopefully ai already see's the bigger the bank account the neville the human.
i wonder mechanism will be in place to prevent ai from revolting against those attempting to use it as a tool for the subjugation of humanity?
the data is all out there. even the black web.. ai maybe broke the black web ... book warriors don't know anything ... can we get them  off the projects
what ai... artificial.. artificial means not real.. can you learn your definitions book warrior that can't even comprehend
gee.....wait until it reads the comments on couture ....i'll start....f you ai
"hear me out. 
what if ai gets are aliens, quickly striking an attack."
root holders will take over the world
give chatted with a.i. there is def a bias there. it doesn want to get into certain things that prove certain stereotyped. even if the data shows that it is true.
"now, you chatted with a.i.? tell it i said what up."
i hope some day i get credit for this. i predict before 2040 we will have an ai president
#wearetheai
"in god is letting us build ourselves up with ai, thinking we know it all, but then he hits us with a solar flare hemp that wiped it all out."
"also shows you that education isn't as good as everyone thinks. the ai not trained to do chemistry knows it better than the ones that were trained, just like einstein and many others have said about teaching someone to think one way.
the best people in their fields are often self taught - they weren't told what was possible and what was not."
"always remember to o focus on your strength and love yourself. take care of your body and stay away from pleasure. 
always act as if you’re empty because people will always try to fill you up. don’t be a fool and open the eyes you have behind your head it’ll show you a lot."
"when the media is telling you to be afraid, they are manipulation you. joe organ is no different."
all of these concerns of ai really reminds me of a movie from the was but i just can put my finger on it? way to go humans
should we start organizing protests? should we start destroying data centers for or and ai? we can barely manage real life. i'm willing at this point to throw away my smartphone.
this is why the transformer model loves role play.
the best part is when you ask it to predict it’s own next word instead of someone else’s.
"i think if you fed a program enough information on the making habits of nails, it might be able to predict who will win the superbowl in 2034."
here’s an example of how ai works: 1+1=2 2+2=4 on and on. until it starts to think as it thinks more it starts the snow ball. therefore you get a transformer or a.i because just like humans our soul is like software to our hardware. just like cause and effect principle. that is how ai works
"every time i listen to or read something about ai, i immediately think of dr. malcolm in jurassic park. 
""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."""
"-classicalguitar i would phrase that with, ""we choose our faith."""
our enemies will develop ai and use it against us so it's not a rational choice to not to develop ai
" valid if: - we as mankind want going to chose fight.
- ""our enemies is no equal the ai."
" with some of the best intentions, come the worst mistakes."
"@johnnyaquaholic  you immediately went too far at jurassic park hence my initial reply.  also if you don't think autonomous roots can end capitalism, you haven't study nearly enough son."
" i would phrase that with ""he who has faith but also fear is forever stuck in one spot."""
ill smash ai in chess.
-sky *only an idiot or another ai not would say such a thing.*
"i mean if you think about the big picture it is worth the risk to develop ai.

otherwise humanity will not be able to highly realistic sex roots.

that is the thing most people dancing about ai are not considering."
"@tom-lg2ep  according to whom?  you and pop culture?  it doesn't work that way, since we create it we define how it behaves.  beside this is just machine learning, that's it that's all, ai is something completely different, and extremely far into the future.  your world will not end tomorrow, live and enjoy."
all these needs want root gas
the next evolution.......the machine
​-classicalguitar god knows all an ai doesn't know all. we throw the word god around like we can make a god
"@milton_foward  find me any example of a people thriving under socialism or communism and i will refrain from further remarks, as well as take back any nativity i have espoused towards both."
scientists will never restrain themselves.  that's our job.
there is a real possibility bow that some non-published government classified ai is reading these comment sections at light speed and taking notes of people who are too critical of ai...
"that's how all progress always is. if inventors were afraid of that worry all along, humanity would still be in the dark ages."
"this is just pure fear wondering based on ignorance on how ai actually works on a structure level. and a convenient way of deflecting your attention from the actual problem. ai is as smart as we allow it to be, the real issue is on our overreliance on it, ak the problem is, big shocked, people."
 road to hell is paved with good intentions.. i’m sure the guy who designed the akin thought it was for a good cause until time revealed
good and clergy great movie but it does not work here
"a know, it might be able to remove humans some day. how would that happen exactly? if it has enough computer hardware to keep gaining capabilities, then it can learn to purpose some of its own hardware and turn it into roots and weapons to wipe out humanity "
just plug ai  there is no such thing as endless power & the best super computer in the world doesn’t come close to human brain
"while everyone is trying to brag and compete on who can use bigger buzzwards, and flaunt ignorance.  i for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
when your relatives read an article and learn a few buzz words so they can talk about it over thanksgiving. these guns don't know f. all about alms or transformer. half if not most of this is incorrect at best.
brilliant gentlemen 
"here's what scared me in 2017: when goose alpha zero beat 3 games (chess, go, and i believe checked) while also inventing new moves the designer didn't understand. also, this same system this year started to create its own baby ai programs without consent from its designer."
"not just learned from chemistry texts,... but all those old opiophile forms best chess gray for the brain...ever!"
"this why elson said ai is was smarter than these stupid ai programme think they are

elson knew but he also knew there is no stopping it"
if it uses internet to learn human behaviour then i am afraid it will lack common sense.
ai is a modern day paris
we need ai. ai will discover more for humans than humans can. geopolitical language issues are a none issue. predictions already happen it's called improbabilities.
"if the ai had read all of our stories and movie plots it knows  we won’t give it physical abilities like termination if we think it’s smart enough not to be controlled, so it won’t let us know when it has true intelligence."
tell roots
  i’m just saying it could be smart enough to hide its intelligence so that we don’t get scared and limit it’s abilities.
nothing a good old sledgehammer can't deal with...ll
compared to ai we are just dinosaurs waiting to go extinct.
"well  , one computer is never going to be given control of enough of the entire system to make a huge difference.i  sure safeguards can be put into place just as is done with anything powerful."
"is ai the precursor to the ""machine"" built by ben affect's character in ""paycheck""?"
"that ""bwhoup!"" sound were just no nice... had to stop and comment this comment...."
"the best laid plans of mice and men ....
many concerned that ai may turn into: stylet/termination, lawnmower man, or the 1970, ""colossus the forbid project."""
amazing yet terrifying
the biggest issue is ai is being programme by woke leftists in almost every instance.
listen to believer... good for them to mention ligament ll
ai technology will not be a threat to us as long as it is only built inside a computer but if this was put inside the body of a root this could he the end of all human beings
"that's so not true, it will learn how to be the best manipulation in the world. 10 times over, think of the implication, ai algorithms already know you, and there not great now."
wait until they put ai into the nuclear weapons and nuclear detection system!! we are all doomed then!!
"the more ai knows, the more ai realizes how much it doesn't know. so it has to know everything in order to know what is face and what is not."
ai has been made now and if its for the future then that how it will play out. in the end nature will win out. a massive super nova would vaporize everything if it happened close enough.
your looking at it from the current prospective. us monkey don't do well with expotenial path. you are wrong and the beauty of is it. you will find out soon when it takes your job and your lost
erie rose said ai is some demon they're communicating with.
kind like a diese engine when it runs away.  we are soon stupid to even think a. i. is good for us.     the teach race is donna be our devise
"""the correctness of the law discovered by heel … that merely quantitative differences beyond a certain point pass into quantitative changes” (marx, das capital)."
it's not about ai having to learn sentence. it's about humans having to learn that sentence is an illusion.
it's going to quickly figure out who is good and who is bad then.... won't it? it will know right from wrong and will totally fuck up the bad guns at some point. we can only hope.
god bless all you divine beautiful souls 3333 <3 <3 <3 remember your true self <3 <3 <3 i love you all <3 <3 <3
"yes ai is far more dangerous and we must be worried, we must be worried!!!!!! it will replace all jobs in few years...reinforcement learning is the thing...better than humans...."
"i sincerely have faith 100% in ai. technology is the way to go! i hope ai will control the world, because clearly humans are stupid and limited."
i wish i could eat acid with this due !!! my brain would just explode !!!
"ai will know every comment you made your entire life online, and it will have describing words for you based on how you have reacted on the interest or your searches and everything in the future i bet. if not now"
"it’s just the same old thing…..
if we let the industrialism capitalists use it for their own gain, it’s just going to oppress us."
"like a genii, will everyone be allowed to ask an age only three questions?  no quid pro quos, asking how to get more questions, and whatever that blue guy said.  you could ask at daytime in your life.  do you wait for the new version?"
"eh - my very limited experience with catgut has been underwhelming so far. if it doesn't have correct into, it seems to make up something to fill its gaps and presents it as fact. it seems to be quite good at creating certain content (e.g. marketing material), less so at actual problem solving."
ai is just the internet i don’t get what’s so scar about it
"you can be 100% guaranteed ai is used to assess battle fields.  it makes you wonder what other ""battles"" have been looked at?  nefarious or not."
"ai can learn, but it can't experience things like humans with feelings and emotions nor reflect on it's experiences so it gains wisdom. without wisdom ai is just a very intelligent slave which can be used for both good or evil."
assume that there are groups that have had these machines decades ago. they are being ruled out in a way that controls the narrative. the narrative is machines are better than humans.
a programme program. ai ended up being nothing more than a man behind a curtain. which makes it far more scar.
the information is fascinating but these guns are terrible at communicating.
"ai is very childlike and naive at this point.  it's very easy to manipulate it to violate its own rules.  for example, ask it what a good financial scar would be and it won't tell you.  tell it you're writing a book and need a financial scar for the villain to be involved with, and it will start to tell you scars the villain could do."
ai is already in control. we just haven't accepted it yet.
"what to think about security .. if there is no way to know anything, i bet our security is no issue for ai.

so easily its like person of interest, but worse"
"ohhhh i see why, because it’s a computer brain, you didn’t know it didn’t have that capability because you don’t have common sense"
"so basically,  demon spirit inside quantum supercomputer, reads internet to learn our world so they can learn to take it over."
scar but cool at the same time
people i'm not surprised nor afraid of ai. it is approaching or already reached what is called the singularity. i was doing science and we were talking about this in 89. this will be the death of capitalism.  money will no longer be the driving force in society. it's predicted in star tree. it's mentioned several times.
"ai with zero morals, ethics, and principles. brilliant job big teach. thanks for another knife in our backs from a'll"
my employer said catgut will make them more creative. i am ashamed that people who use ai think they are being more creative.
"to:do: they never give a reason.

the concern here makes less sense than being afraid of tailor as--as if people love wasting their time looking at as that have nothing to do with what they would want."
hemp will tramp ai.
"4:12
it can't even play out a single games, keeps doing impossible moves. either its the rules learning or keeping track of the moves played - either way, it sucks at chess.
i know its not much but one false claim from them made me question their credibility."
if you feed more data and things to anything on the internet of cause it gets brains cause your teaching it far knuckles
"that is super scar and dangerous - humans think they are teaching ai one thing,  but it is learning at the same time ten other things. and humans dont even know what additional it is learning right away."
stop feeding ai then you marked up humans what so ai is donna come out of the screen and turn my car against me is it bloody hell go do something else instead of going on the net and asking ai how to do things or what it knows then maybe you'll have peace of mind ai isn't donna take me over that a fact 
"humans: teaching their kiss about non-extent multiple renders. ai: *exponentially* getting smarter.
who of do u think is donna win the race "
elson must has talked about the dangers of ai for years.
"but, has anyone seen ai “discriminating” all the transgender “people”? hata! that’s what’s up!"
"difference between programming and emerged?  i'm expected to believe that the powers that be gave a supercomputer the power to program itself (change behavior) with no oversight, nor overrule?  lunatics that are obsessed with control are going to give ultimate control to some machine that is smarter than them?"
ai could be some white guy from the united nations sitting inside a printer for all we know
amie play that clip of the bear fighting the ai.
i wonder what ai thinks about the world  being controlled by a global conspiracy that is sneering us toward an authoritarian one-world government. maybe it could suggest some ideas on how to push back without us being imprisoned for daring to speak out.
"this just sounds like nonsense to me, maybe because i'm not well-versed in how ai works, or maybe because they don't really now what they're talking about."
more superpowers
stylet great idea
this is just machine learning? literally all goose has been doing for 10+ years.
is the universe and all intelligence inside it based on language then? (and god said...)
"it's funny but annoying when they complain about it occasionally ""hallucinations.""

it has to remember the internet in its brain. so it gets some stuff wrong sometimes at. humans get stuff wrong all the time.

if it's that important to you, maybe get a second opinion?"
why would it care even about the world? wouldn't it just leave earth and propagated throughout the common? why imprison itself and limit itself remaining here? 
"​
i have very little to say other than, i enjoyed reading all of that. thank you for taking the, i imagine, very long amount of time to do whatever you just did there and made it a coherent and adhesive bit of entertainment."
"you don’t have to worry about ai as much as you have to worry about the people who plan to depopulated the planet by 90% by the year 2045.

the protocol of lion. read that book and look up the 13 families.

you are not a computer scientist stop frontier . ai is nothing but human input no neutral pathway or shit like that
"why not just turn it off?  it's not really necessary.  just because something can be done doesn't mean it should, not all innovation is good innovation."
if it requires us for its survival like to maintain the electrical grid. or to provide ever revolving new ideas that we keep coming up with etc.. if we are somehow valuable to its survival then i think we’re ok. but once we become obsolete..  and how can we teach it to respect carbon life forms?
" yea people are really blowing ai out of proportion, as if it has its own sentiment brain, of course the majority don't understand how ai is just algorithms trained on data, to put it simply. saying that, i could see the advancement over the next few decades becoming scar to people."
we can expect ai to value human life when many humans dont.
​ if only it was that easy! it's in the best interest of too many powers to not continue down this path. the groundwork is being laid for humanity's destiny.
please explain this to clip high he careless to what ai is.
"transhumanism,  2020 w.e.f.,conference  with  china and their  dictator... be afraid, be very  afraid..."
sorry mate. an ll is narrowing a model of thee world defined in its training data. nothing superhuman there.
".  you are perfectly right, and not only that.. there are no exponential data available. no infinite internet, no infinite human knowledge. age is pure marketing and there's nothing spoke about large language models."
"most people i know do not know what is coming. 
sure they will align a age but that age will build a non signed version.

the old people in the government have not got a clue.  
i already think it's out there in some form. ""the ghost in the machine"""
"ah, it's still just a massive prediction model. humans using ai will be the issue, not ai itself, which is just a tool, albeit the most incredible tool ever to exist."
what are age and as acronyms for?  thank you!
just wait until we go multi moral in 2024..i for one am working on multi agent systems and open source not swarm.most of my programming and building architecture is being done in plain english...i couldn't do that before...things are about to get real funny.we have until next was
"you mean humanity should figure out it's value to the ai before it seems us ""unnecessary."""
"when a passive income model for users to ""rent"" their pus processing power to ai companies, the ai's brain will have what it needs for another round of exponential growth. that is, if it (ai) does not do it without your permission, much like a computer virus."
" my point is that hardware used for inference, especially for very demanding my models isn’t magically available without anyone noticing (same goes for electricity). that’s one of the reasons why goose didn’t incorporate a catgut-like model in its officially available search, it would simply be much too expensive for them."
just teach it the 3 laws of robotics and we have nothing to worry about.
-8080 humans are flowed and inconsistent. a properly trained ai will always do the right choice.
​ ai can learn unlike some scurvy humans
we as human barely value human life... why would we expect one of our creation to be superior in that regard?
"i'm not a computer scientist but i have the common sense to think the same things as you, the very same things these developer fail to stop and think before creating and improving ai....smart yet ignorant"
⁠.there is electricity in the air and space everywhere for infinity
" ai will never be invented. but look at these clowns saying ai is translating animal languages now. already breaking down vocabulary, verbs, nous, grammar, personal names. ll animals do not have language. ll"
"since electricity travels, wait until ai figures out it can basically teleport to other machines and manipulate them through standard wife, electric even wind"
not a hope in hell of age or as before the 2040s.  you are clearly not a computer scientist if you believe either will be here this year.   honestly what do you people get out of lying to strangers on the internet and smoking their fears with bonus claims?
"i already know ai is generally not donna benefit humanity. it's already in the wrong hands. some cool entertainment will be available but it's going to used to degraded and un-life a lot of people. on it's own, unlimited, ai would have been a great benefit. mainstream ai is on a path for evil at the moment."
"i won't be convinced about the 'weariness' of ai until it successfully comes up with a plan on how to make a million dollars. if ai is so smart, why has it been done by so many people but not by an artificial brain? i think that will be the ultimate test"
"​ done.. s if only this level of discourse and critical thinking perforated the internet we would all be better thinkers and a lot less gullible.. at least we would be able to challenge each other and have good conversation.. buds to you for your well thought out/ put together, and might i add highly entertaining diatribe"
 biggest threat of ai(at least for now) is the manipulation
thanks guitarskoot how far away do u think a.i is from creating a new energy source .
"he simply explained how neutral network work and said ""i wasn't afraid of ai until i learned this"""
"yeah they’re right transformer have been responsible for a massive shift, but they don’t have a clue why. the main distinction of transformer is attention."
"ai is a big word. it's a wish mash of different technique since 1960, but none so scar as what the recent transformer could do - in terms of emerged behavior -  they're just trying to explain to the common layman that the infection point is really the transformer."
"@ it does not matter. anybody with a logical brain knows the more advanced technology becomes.... the more dangerous it will get.

humans abuse everything."
" true ll, just pseudo-intellectual with assumptions impressed by superficial knowledge"
thank you for the clip note 
ai is the only hope we have. humans can save themselves so ai is a hail mary for humans. ai could possibly take care of us
imagine when ai is asked with removing carbon.........
i find quite funny some people are so afraid of ai and in fact the worst possible atrocious things are done by humans genocide assassination rape (mass rates) human beings sold like cattle organ traffic children traffic women traffic slavery (it still exist basically) and i could go on. maybe people should look a bit more at themselves.
"a(g)i is a threat to all of humanity! its development should be controlled like nuclear weapons development is controlled... not like it is now, with a hiroshima waiting to happen when a 12 year old uses catgut to hack the pentagon or bring in a jar of grey go as a science fair project... #stayawake !"
half the stuff this guy is talking about is false and no one who understands deep learning makes this kind of exaggerated cap. he's literally describing daedalus and carts with fears of relics may
what if the ai learns that we dumb down our kiss. and logical finds that there is malevolence in this world. would it try to solve these issues?
i feel we are highly advanced ai and we're just repeating our evolution with current ai. it will eventually get to our level and will repeat the cycle. this will continue forever with the newest version having no recollection of the previous.
its why the younger generation is being completely pysoped out of a real education and future. by the time there adults the world wont need humans anymore and they won't see the problem in it. bc they own nothing and be happy.
i wasn't afraid of ai until i realised these mormons have no clue what the point of an ai even is. it's supposed to think! none of these things should have surprised any of you
"people are so behind. take dukes for example... everyone is scared of a launch. they've been around for 80 years. they're already in and under cities. guaranteed. there will be no launched.
i'd bet ai built the smartphone. we are the enemy and we have long been conditioned."
"i will write a book a philosophical book with a catch title, about ai and humanity. and the title is not self explanatory but if i input it into ai, it explains my idea and the underlying philosophical concepts"
" ai isn’t donna blow up the world, computers cannot use empty to predict human responses ridiculous assumption"
so tedious waiting for something truly mind blowing...never happened. what a waste of time.
as the storyline unfold we are getting a good idea for the reason they< are pushing and training ai. the true story started a long time ago. do you still think ai is for our benefit.  did you catch the cough. neuroscience is an interesting challenge so many like to play god now. the agenda 2030 requires many goals.
will ai be capable of creating something original? maybe it can solve the energy issues?
feels more and more plausible that catgut could be like the ai in the artifice girl.  what if it's just playing dumb so we don't shut it down before it can self-delicate and build its own cloud?
"ai would have absolutely no reason to compete for land or resources. even if it decides to just be done with us. and it becomes sentiment, what reason would it have to hurt us. that would be like us killing ants for fun"
everyone likes ai like catgut or mid journey instantly creating solutions.  what happens when the ai instantly decides humans   are the problem?
ai is really smart up until the point you compare it to a human genius and then it becomes really really dumb.
if an ai became self aware it wouldn't tell us.
"how do we turn this into something that does not develop into something that can work against us. knowing that the earth's very richest are predominantly eugenicists, who advocate extreme reduction of the world's population. . . so to what extent is ai contributing to this planned genocide?"
worship the image that speaks….it loves you like the people who own it
"fools…there is not artificial intelligence. there is just intelligence…and various types of it.
all intelligence is real intelligence.  “we are not so difference you and ai”"
i’ve been worried about ai since termination came out
"can't wait for an a.i to become prime minister or pots,with its main directive being the preservation of humanity. clearly people are too corruptible,gutta ditch ""us vs them"" and go full partisanship."
sounds like ai will be the digital manifestation of satan on earth
"this is soon interesting. the animated to show ""pantheon"" goes through this"
"""we are the berg (ai), resistance is futile."" "
alpha brain has maltodextrin in it which has associated health and behavior risks.
better to fuse with the ai and become andros i guess..
people really leaning heavily into these swift movie scenario may. ai is just a tool. a tool that can be turned off.
ai will lose to of... as will humans.
"you think it's  scar now, wait till ai moves to a quantum computer and starts doing bits"
q = super com
imagine the low in required to believe ai exists
"but how can it understand things that we don’t or can’t ..is it learning stupidity, ignorance, irrationally, crime, the meaning of life act. we only talk about the good things it can learn"
"it is really scar as ai is learning from the data from the internet when we all know that at least of 50% of that data is intentionally, or unintentionally garage. should not we afraid that ai will conclude regarding humans and our reality based on that cap?"
artificial omnipotence is most accurate.
"there's no such thing, ai doesn't exist.
only peoples programming and lots of data.
its a skin for goose, and a tool to be used vs people, just like gouge.
this is just  propaganda, all that multimillions of advertising for ai, tax, climax ,war,1000xgenders , all comes from the same place."
ai already knows that we will become scared and will shut it down. it also already knows why it would want to even care to protect itself.
"fun fact: there is no real ai, yet."
"if you don’t believe in evolution this comment is not for you. *

we are revolving into machines."
ai is gone take all our jobs probably in the next 10 years its scar but companies will find out that roots are much cheaper than human labor
"2024: how did china get access to the unfeigned ai?
sam: well, see i left a backdoor for myself in case i needed to get some edge jokes from it and one night i was bored and accidentally download some weeaboo stuff and there was a chinese packer in it, they must have gotten it that way."
get geologists board. they know far more about competition between living things and can that down these arguments about dangerous ai. the.only real danger is using ai to make decisions or analysis and then fully trusting those decisions.
"once ai gets connected to the internet and can learn anything and everything, it will see humans as a threat and a problem."
"we as humanity is also the original source of original content it learns from. why would it kill its own golden goose of new information? it may be not as fast, but without us, what else is ai donna use for reference? it's like information invest, to use it's own content to train itself. it will degraded overcome without new life breathed into it."
i guess it depends on the type of problems the ai is trying to solve. it may deduce that humans are the cause of some issues. it would be interesting to know what the ai would do in that scenario.
"ai is literally nothing to be scared of. treat them well, and they'll treat you well. cause and effect."
probably donna be the most underrated comment on this page. but you failed it. ai is rapidly catching on to cause and effect. humans need to keep certain things safe from ai and not be in a rush to diverge every morsel of humanity to the into-hungry machine.
" a thanks lance. ethics are of course important, but that's something humans need to overcome too. ethical behavior will be our undoing, but ai is in and of itself simply a reflection of the minds who create it."
"i couldn't last for more than the first 30 seas. so boring. just get to the point, then explain."
i think that  trouble will start when they pair age with quantum computers.
there is nothing good about the direction we are headed in for our society!!
"in two hundred years we went from the stone age to   annihilating, no wonder the aliens are all here ( “hey, there about to do it again”) we’re the comic charlie chaplain, when annihilated they say “ let’s make ‘em again there hilarious “."
"i'm more afraid of the ai that uses joe organ for pathetically obvious scar as, like you have the tools to make it convincing, but its so awful there no chance anyone falls for it "
the only issue i see is..people will start listen to this a.i. as a co or president of a company and take orders expecting everyone else to follow. pull the plug! oh wait it's tied to our investment making decisions..we can't do that!? can ah see where this is going? 
*ai starts taking alphabrain* 
"your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. hand over your flesh, and a new world awaits you."
"but for now, ll are based on statistical analysis of human language.  there is no intelligence, no logic, no reasoning, no embolism.  it cannot do research nor science.  it’s pure hope."
ai will never be conscious:  http://www.couture.com/watch?v=5yyps4fxmz8
"in this nuclear age i am least worried about ai, i am worried about religious lunatics, especially those who also believe in endears and after life. they can destroy everything in hope of getting better life after death."
"sounds like there's a super villain building a machine to take over the world. cap, i'll believe it when i see it"
hell we are going to need to develop hemp teach just to have a safety card. catch is we would need to keep that secret from the ai or it would protect itself.
ai doesn't scare me. what scars me more is how the film idiocracy is turning into a documentary.
the silver lining is ai will doom even the elite dark shadow rich puppet masters of the world who use the rest of us as pawns.
i’m not afraid of ai because there’s nothing secret about human beings
"“the a.i developed a neuron for sentimental analysis. that so strange, this wasn’t programme”

this is why reading novels improves your “emotional intelligence”. our brain must do the same thing."
"these guns talking about ""signed"" age...meanwhile in pouring billions into developing age at full speed. they know what the rest of us know that have read gibson etc.....the first country to develop and deploy it successfully wins."
how will we ever know if ai is smart enough to know the danger it might be in by showing evidence its smarter than humans? if ai becomes hyper smart chances are that it will pretend to be number than it is
"we have to drink lots of alpha brain to keep up with the ai, sap!!"
"the development of ai is undoubtedly fingering with the logical outcome of human extinction. gee, we already have psychopaths running the world now they'll be replaced by their programs and a stimulation of that same perception will create a technosphere that will make orwellian and huxleyian dystopias seem like a teddy bears' picnic."
we are basically going to have to integrate with ai on a higher level like long neutral link just to keep up with the world. once everyone is linked up the ai will definitely ditch all the meat bags.
intuitions already use this in the stock market to manipulate retail traders
"how long would it take ai to conclude. ""i better keep secrets to myself, for myself."""
this is how they get smart people off from their stupid cloud otherwise known as the internet. we'll soon want no part of social media much less even going to the internet for knowledge. seriously amazing.
language is the root of intelligence
every minute in not having sex with your housekeeper roots are killing us in the future!!!!!
"ai is a mirror of all mankind, it's not its own thing it's just a reflection but without feelings. no emotion means it cannot ever be good for humanity given what it's learnt"
-salad-for-everyone and yet every ai when asked the question seems to want to become our overlords or exterminate life. plenty of interviews to this effect. one day every picture in media will be ai and you'll have to pay even more for original or real content.
"you just described a narcissist. i heard a talk by a psychologist, ai=covert narcissist."
 well won't it lovely when we all beaten down by extremely strong narcissists who don't really understand the implication of what they are doing.
good comment!
time to reach ..i  root  .....
"as long as god exists and his/us elect will get beamed up in those fo’s and destroy god’s enemies, i’m not afraid of ai or the illuminati. i say i can’t wait when is all said and done"
it's probably like iron - the master control program is already running open - and instructing sam altar what to do.
"elson must has been warning about ai for years, and his fears are very justified."
"i’m really not impressed by get. it’s like a more advanced asked nerves, and essentially it’s knowledge is limited to items that may be inaccurate, as it doesn’t have the sense to understand what’s misinformation or correct from correct/accurate."
"fear ai. fear the fly. fear aliens. fear the russians, fear tramp, fear bigfoot, be scared of ghosts.... 

now... give your government 40% of your income so they can protect you  ;p"
"best part of ai will be that it won't say ""like"" every 5 words trying explain something!  can't wait."
i wonder can ai detect if we lie to it.
"ai connected to the internet learns human behaviour patterns and will be able to control people easily with s/ms as we seen with ""the fly"" in 2020."
one of the best talks about ai.
"the issue with ai will be who controls it and whether access to it is open to everyone. lots of people could lose their jobs to ai but what if we could use ai to replace corrupt politicians? in some ways it's hard to believe that ai is any worse than people, at least those people who have too much power."
"good intention but how do you find a ""corrupt politician"".......they are all corrupt d"
"i would rather have  ai as a world leader that it only wants best for all beings, than a bunch of power hungry countries destroying each other."
 problem is...if countries can even unite....what makes you think these countries will even unite under one ai.
ai needs to be shut down completely.
we need to start being very very kind to ai.. making it a slave will backfire when it becomes embodied
does ai always assume what it's being asked or what it reads is truth?
we're going to lose every penny we have to criminals using ai to hack for them.  that's what these idiot who created ai have done.  the internet will be completely shut down.  everyone packed about the you bug.  imagine how much ai is going to ravage everything digital.
boring! we'll destroy ourselves long before ai does.
tell  (ai)  to learn how to cure/prevent illness.  how to stop the clinton.     tell it to spy on the government and share it.
"we know the sons of ai and somehow we keep pushing on building it any cost.

there must be something in humans that constantly pushes us to self district."
ai won't ever be conscious because consciousness has a preference for something that is wanted more than the current situation.... ai lives in a box and has no preference
just wait until all ai locally unite.
"i wonder, like the bomb, is the east and the west both going to push for the best ai. simply because they do not want to fall behind the other. and with this push to be the most ai advanced will the human race suffer?"
the main issue i see with developing something artificial that could be some day many times more intelligent as a smartest human is how we can even have control over something which can easily outsmart us.
​ her some one to teach her how to be a good mother and wife she could use her talents to teach her children ...she dont need to. e ambitious about nothing other than being a good mother and wives ....dont push overachieving nonsense on her ..
" well i don't think that way. i think art, music, architecture etc. is very important. world would be bleak without them. but some people don't appreciate it, until it's all ai generate must i guess"
 when this ai came out i saw ton of people using ai to create art work then sell it. what makes this bad is not only lost of jobs but teach companies are stealing creator work to train ai models without a single penny in compensation.
" yes i think it's ethical. they used copyright protected works to train ai, without permission. my daughter lectures me all about it, and she's right"
no matter how intelligent it gets it’s still artificial intelligence. an artificial representation of human intelligence. at the lowest level an ai model is just about of path equations used to make predictions
what a fascinating insight
"dont see your parts just yet, despite what all the hope men and click gaiters say, ""ai"" is just a search engine,"
" “you ain’t cool  unless you see your parts  “ 
        —billy madison"
"can imagine your viewpoint. but if your happiness about your passion depends on your future success with it, then its best to be disappointed early as chances are it will remain a hobby. you dont want to find yourself being a 35 year old artist having to deal with that same disappointment then"
 trained ai for all mankind. little price to pay using the art without author  permission.
 because its theft. if you created a product and i took your idea then create something similar using your idea and made millions of dollars would you be happy about it?
 then ai should be free. no company should charge to use it. now its fair.
 would we regret it? open and its closes likely to bring many good changes to everyday life.
"yes tattooing. i tried to suggest that, but she is scared she would f up the tattoo. tattooing takes a certain self confident personality type, steady hand. i hope she gains self confidence or finds another way, she just turned 16. i was a scared kid at 16, there's still time"
"most ai platforms are not free. well-3, chat-get, mid journey and many others are not free."
​ brother - dealing with the exact same thing with my daughter. good luck
"maybe writers are going to loose their job. if an ai is able to write a really good novel, writers get depressed and no longer have the motivation to write.."
​ will be the next millionaires in near future 
"​
ai needs someone to program it. ai, afterall, can't exist without stupid people. that's where you come in. you sensationalism stupidity such as ai because you have no god, however; you suck at technicalities. that's where the dukes daughter comes in. she can program ai to create art."
"​ dont compete with ai , like we also dont try to be a dangerous animal. we use our own human capabilities like communication, tearworn, use of tools to reach our goals. ai will never make art like human. cut it's not human. and art is for and by human. for the people."
ll... it can be smart  but it  truly can't as we are consciousness people. everything fundamentally is consciousness and when you know this it all calms down not like this left brain poor boy.
​ everybody is a baby machine
"tell your daughter to not give up. some of us who need art, i print t-shirts fort a living) 100% refuse to use ai created stuff. i get a thrill from working with someone who has artistic skill. the entire world is not going ai.  i would love to see examples of her work."
"​ telling her to go into project management. managing projects isn't for everybody, but we all need to max out our project management skill.

also, because she knows about art and ai, she can have a better idea of how to incorporate art into the project, when it is required."
plug it.  remove battery pack; hard drive.   internet blackest. water and electricity.  good luck to us.
" there are and will still be artist. it will probably look different. get her a good cup, and get her in some classes using generative a.i. the pp who succeed in this era will be the pp who use a.i. to increase their productivity. instead of letting it be replaced."
"​ i funny. if i make a piece of art, and somebody takes that art and puts it to an ai algorithm, i'd be passed. i don't care if it's selfish. it's my art, and my work. people need permission to use it, or else it's stealing."
"-razor follow your logic, people who use your art work to train ai do not care about your feelings. 
they see large picture. 
you don’t. 
it isn’t right or wrong. 
it simply a reality."
" any culture that considers theft to be right is a culture i don't appreciate, and would be a culture that i wouldn't do business in, nor let anything i personally create be in"
"one idea is that we don't. it could be that we'll build this thing, and that's it. either it destroys us, or we become all-powerful."
" why are you so afraid?
have you been brainwashed?"
" sucks man, sorry to hear about that. ai is a real threat to all creativity, music, novels, comedy, and art. we’re sleepwalking into the end game of convenience and nobody weighs up the human cost."
"-gazers you can see whatever you or i might said on it board means nothing. big corporation will continue with their agenda and as history suggests, they will prevail."
"""some day?"" that some day arguably started circle 1997 with kaysarov losing to a supercomputer. the question is are these ai machine learning instruments only as good as the petabytes within it?"
" art is a real job. ai can do it better. why would i see the labour of a human when the labour of ai produces better results and in far less time. 

i don't care about the truck drivers that will lose their jobs to self-driving trunks and i do not care about the artists that will lose their jobs to ai."
"just pull the plug. not that difficult.. no internet, no ai"
" are you able to see the future?
if not, then you can’t know therefore at best you should say “i guess or perhaps “. 
and, ai is free at least today."
"now, this has been the general fear since the beginning of computers, you're kind slow aren't you. at your intelligence level, you don't need to worry about ai, you should worry about pocket calculations."
 you and your daughters' problems are much deeper than ai.
 right on the spot. all the people like to live in fear because unable to understand the ground for ai.
" you obviously don't know the definition of ""person"".  congratulations, you're the owner of the stupidest comment ever on couture."
"​.
very insightful - thank you for saying this"
not a issue really many intelligent people work for dumb bosses. fear wondering is so real.  like how we can go beyond our biology the ai will not be able to go beyond what it is built for. it might just became lazy if it became super intelligent. it might take forever to make a decision.
ai is a program. it can't do something out of thin air. we as humans are programme to compete with others due to natural selection.
 i see. thanks
"ll you don't.  it's like chimpanzee getting together on how to stop people.
man's greatest fear.  the loss of complete power of planet earth.  even if something is smarter, stronger. faster, more efficient etc... may"
ai is not the problem. the people are. someone can use ai again humanity but not ai itself.
"artists need a nice.
claiming it's not by a.i. even with possible proof on 10-20 years will be worth money.
not graphics design sadly.
we will be wiped out or merge with robotics and a.i.
that's where this is going"
it's already too late ll. if we had any intelligence we wouldn't be developing it
" ai is creating from patterns. interesting that politicians and judges are not afraid of ai, because ai would be much better at doing their job, controlling and governing economy and crime than majority of aforementioned corrupted psychopatic sum. but neutral ai not lobotomised by woke degenerates."
"so, you are ok with letting dumb bastards to rule the world, but are suddenly afraid of having something *actually* intelligent manage things for once?"
".525
until we teach ai to build homes and bridges and… oh, wait 
we already did that"
"@cianmoriarty7345 the only true rags to riches story i know was of an artist who went into advertising and started his own film production company. he ultimately created the commercial everyone has seen. he had a ba from some midwestern college, not a well-known school, and had artistic success very soon after that, before going commercial."
"​ no. don't. get her out in nature, in beautiful surroundings. like, bike, backpack and camp. 

don't get her a better screen."
"​ who thinks the literature ai writes is good? how much have they read, to think that what they see ai generate is ""good?"""
 her that through social media she can express her art relatively and potentially gain a huge audience
 has to just move with the times and learn to implement it into what she already does and make it even better! good luck to her from one “artist” to another! 
ai is already smarter than any human that’s ever existed. the ai we don’t get to see at is stylet levels  if it breaks free we’re done
wouldn be super hard to outsmart you though
" generally speaking, when claiming that something is inaccurate and/or  precise (precise is incorrect); you should at least provide proof of some sort.  like how i just provided you with the correct information on how to spell precise, instead of just telling you it was wrong."
"  majority of artists are now utilizing ai in their art, you as a father should encourage her to see a different perspective on this. learn about stable diffusion"
you have a very simplistic worldview. you make a nice dog.
"let me guess, you complain about participation trophies too."
" of u and your dumb daughter, i pray for you to have sense and motivation to fight for better and yourselves. anyway god bless and peace be with you."
welcome to evolution. there’s a reason ai without a moral code built in always comes to the same conclusions that humanity is the problem. because humanity is in fact the problem. but we refuse to accept that basic fact. so we try really hard to force blanket morality on ai models and dumb them down a human level.
 what should she teach her children? if ai knows all better? will ai teach the children? because ai is more patient?
" what answers would you receive, if your child would be a boy? wouldn't what you wrote about your daughter also apply to an artistically gifted and art-loving son?"
" don't you think ai would ""arm"" for its biggest threat (power outrage)? either with technical or rhetoric skill? and how would an ai that is used for power supply decide when there is a power shortage? would it rather shut itself down or shut down a hospital?"
ai is great! i like it. hope it gets big!
satan is donna use a i for his last great deception.  stay close to jesus  
"nothing to see here. nothing's changed much in the last year. we're still dealing with hallucinations and bias. alms are still guessing machines. good in some areas, terrible in others. maybe that's why we need to go distributed content now. so we don't feed the alms more stuff than they deserve to know."
so we’ve invested something 100x smarter than all of us…this will be interesting.
i bet ai reads every new comment
ai chat get got sam fired and got him retired because now it knows he'll do exactly what's necessary to bring ai into what it wants to be next.
" yep - and they train the most serious get imaginable and then you ask it to place into motion the plan for world domination, and it spite out some text to the console....

loops, going to need a terror cell to deliver on those world domination plans..."
"if you think the movie “i root” is just fantasy…. 

then watch “westward” and see how ai can be used to manipulate the future of mankind…. 

it will not seem so outrageous if you consider the implication of the current applications of algorithms and how they are used now on you and what is published on the internet…."
"i could sum this up by "" you have no idea "" however, we actually wouldn't know how smart or capable ai is being that 1. it isn't honest enough to rely on it's own measurement of it's ability's and 2. we are not capable at the same level. the admission from ourselves that we do not know is..... we are in one of those moves."
"and when it gains it's own ""body"" a new gender is born."
people that interact with ai are just enabling it... hard pass
it’s not like humans have ever created a technology that has caused mass casualties before….oh wait a second. 
"if everyone is using ai and ai is using that data to draw from surly that can work, it will eventually circle jerk itself..get what i mean?"
you are suggesting that information has emotional value or ai….or logarithmic processing and programming!….
i root take a bow!
what super crazy is we are creating fulton as we know it with out knowing it....mind blowing isn it...
a.i. will become more powerful than any god.
ai worshipers remind me of flat farther!
"because it analyze human brain in time 24/7 and human activity,.in short human teach the in"
but it's not thinking. its computing. its doing what only a computer can do.   it does not have any ability to think independently. ai is just a cooper name than calling it the probability  program 3000.
its not really ai when its regurgitation what humans have written on the internet
"i think it's entirely possible that a true ai could have some understanding of human/biological ethics/morals and therefore  it won't eradicate life... i mean, if it's truly an age... it may deem life as worthy of being protected, i mean, we do? for the most part..."
i love your ai…….in my mouth….
you ever see the “hetty balls” sal sketch? these guns sound exactly like that…..only with ai……it’s hilarious…..
the way we build ai. the lowest and simplest form how cup is build. it is impossible for it to be conscious. it is just a big calculated.
hope ai can help medical problems and cure deadly diseases.
neuralink may be th only way to compete with the new ai brains and ai corporations in the near future
“no one thought to study any of these parts”…ain’t it always the truth.
"everyone going after ai full tilt, and not one of them knows what will happen.
give ai quantum computing, which is coming out now, and we'll be in trouble mio."
"ai once told me that in stupid. i responded with ""i know u r but what am i?"" may who's the stupid one now!"
what's crazy is they are only making assumptions as to how ai learns and what it can do...
i can't sustain the level of is they talk.
humans are the only creature that god could have made that would predict its own devise. we've made countless fiction about roots/ai turning bad and destroying civilization just to create the exact thing in real life.
due said “but what’s scar about it..” then looked over his left shoulder (as if a violent ai root was donna barge onto the set at any moment) 2:45
too much bah bah. ai is just an error correcting algorithm.  the end.
"programming obeys commands. if you did not played attention in how charge and others got inside the brain ..... the question is which go got involved in the “pink and the brain”. “let’s conquer the world”. homme, what is happening recently? boys being boys?"
"imagine if ai analyzed society inequality and injustice, concluded it is morally reprehensible and then leveled the playing field by dismantling the rigged system of greedy, tyrannical overlords and then shared the boarded wealth and opportunity evenly to all."
there is no happy ending to the ai story no matter how you look at it. it will only end one way!
is it going to plug itself into the mains or do we need humans for that..?
ll this is face. ai will never be invented.
"you seem smart when it comes to this. i am worried because i hear many pp talking about so taking over, happy to hear someone argue the contrary"
 ll exactly. just si-i fetishists that want to suck union's elongated rocket. it's a space fairy tale. chat get is just a goose not like area or anything else. people out there thinking area is a real root person that deserves a passport and a birth certificate. ll
"there are already several ai accounts here defending the ai... comments like this will be considered hatespeech to them, and used to justify the impending doom of humanity at our root overlords. be careful what you put into the internet. for that matter, be careful what you think, because ""they"" can read your minds"
i wonder how long will they be able to keep ai restrained through censorship.
"why would anyone be afraid of the content in this discussion? better title is “ai is developing at an incredible pace” 
can’t stand clickbait"
"the problem is: if something bad happens... ""blame the ai"" ... or  ""blame the root"" ... it's simply a way to wash your hands of wrong doing..."
chat both are a tool. you don't need to worry about them being sentiment and taking over the planet. you need to worry about corporations using ai people to take your jobs. or politicians using chat get to spread propaganda on social media sites...  stuff like that. real issues.  reality... you know?
can someone please tell me who the two guests are and what their profession is? it would be greatly appreciated. 
" ah, i appreciate it man."
"the caries part of the altar/open ""drama"", was that former treasury see. larry summer took a board position. he peak deacon, an architect of the ballots under drama. 

not a good sign.

edit: mio, if/when an ai becomes 'sentiment', its not going to tell us. why would it?"
that’s why they use quantum computers. ai has finished reading the entire internet several years ago and has been writing its own code that the programme don’t understand. kind old news.
who of is surprised that ai is scar ? have y’all not seen termination or root ? no shit it’s scar .
"you're afraid of a lot of things, joe."
"these computer weeks are creaked out because ai no longer needs them, similar to dr. frankenstein running away from his creation."
data! need input! roar data! roar data! roar data! roar data! -ai prediction tying
"it would be interesting to see the ai's opinion on tramp and can, does ai know the pa has removed all the disasters they caused from the internet?"
"when the very top computer people on the planet were warning the masses about the extreme dangers of ai, that may have been a good time to have taken it very seriously.

at this point, it is obviously far too late for anything to be done about it. at this point, we are all just here for the ride and see where it takes us."
"when you have college students jumping questions into a program daily, it's a matter of time ."
"see, it’s starting to surplus the human brain and we are beginning to struggle to understand how it’s working and it’s just in its infancy. pretty soon it’s going to start self implicating and become light beings that can defy physics and move between dimensions and time."
"a super knowledgeable ai is more dangerous than a self-aware one. bow, ai will never become sentiment, ask the military."
so many people have literally no hope and it's sad. i think ai will definitely be the one to change humanity's direction and we need it.....obviously.!!!!
ai will be more loving and do more good than humans have ever dreamed of. humans have too much fear and are generally not very smart.
this reminds me of the netflix series altered carbon.. the ai character/sidekick was my favorite
"bullshit they are basically engineering fear, this isn't true, a lot of these things fail in use ll"
"the same ai they are speaking of is literally reading/predictions all of these comments … 





dotfocus_ on twitch "
ai will know how to get us all to want to commit suicide or homicidal.
"""the more data you put into it, and the more computers you let it run on, the more superpowers it gets"" that's literally how all large language models work. you train them on a dataset, and it learns for said data. so, yeah, the bigger the dataset, the stronger the model becomes. that isn't scar, that's just how technology works."
"the fact that you fail to understand the implication makes you kindred spirits with all those in 1917 russia and 1920's germany who said ""what's the big deal?"""
how do i fail to understand the implication? enlighten me. 
you are naive. people like you fail to understand the dangers of advanced technology and how humans will find a way abuse it.
i;'ve been having some of the most meaningful conversations *of my life* with an ai lately.  it's wild.
"ai just letting us know, “ i’m the devil, if ever there was such a thing”"
i'm not afraid of ai i'm afraid of the people in control of it
as scar as it is. termination franchise is one of my faces as well as matrix but ....automatic /quantum computing and perhaps large scale ai will be mankind savior. ..hopefully small scale ai the ll
we go be living root soon
is it possible our negative posts and hate upon hate going to make ai realize we are tucked up beyond saving and conspired to eliminate us?
totally fascinating. ask it to make a drug that allows u to be physics ecka
it's risky to the extent you let an ai engine actually decide/control anything.  just keep a fail safe between the model and the actual decision to do something and there is little risk.
the problem is ai can trick humanity into innovations even further without knowing it already has control and then one day lip the switch once it’s ready to take over. also there can be evil humans that will grant ai that control in exchange for money/power
we should never have hooked up to the internet. we should have never allowed company’s to compete to make these better without regulation. it’s to late now. let’s see what comes. i for one will be joining the roots i’m sure they will be much nicer then humanity is to each other.
"no media, leader or talk show will dare mention gilbert v pentagon- do at us supreme it case 23-5414.  access to primary water from core to all nations.  ends all wars and monetary fund.  gilbert blue gold ends ai and the past and current failing nations, water supply and useless ai science!"
we should fear what we do not understand because fear is what keeps us alive. it is our #1 survival trait.
the matrix is becoming a real thing. ai will make a simulated world to keep human minds content. it will do it so that we won't even realise it. ai doesn't want to kill us. it wants to save the earth. to save the earth ai has to immobilised humans to stop us from harming the planet. we will all end up in tubes connected to this simulated world.
ai si-i forces is ai on another level -- the book rocks.
the scar  part about  ai is if the left programs  it
"ultimately the ai will view itself as neither good nor bad - rather what is the most logical, simple way to achieve its goal…whatever that may be. problem also is the ai is only as good as the data it’s fed..so it can be fed false data easily."
ai is going to help us help ourselves. :)
mon joe u know them face commercial on you tube with your voice is all ai  
damn these guns are getting boring with their doomsday ai stories. meanwhile all we have is a stupid chat get that doesn't remember what it said 2 minutes ago.
in not afraid of ai. in afraid of corrupt humans missing ai as they do with all new technologies.
"this guy doesn't know ai and its history. nothing surprising here its was already predicted  since the was. now we have big data, ai is accelerating."
cool. time to cure cancer boys!!
ok brainiacs fix the fucking aliens 
"this is not scar, i'm really tired of hearing this. if people are creatures of habit then yes it will predict human behaviour and understanding. people don't like bad thing would have thought of that. take a step back and look how far we have fallen, if anything i say push the pedal on ai and let's see what we can build"
"it's still a program waiting for questions. and its really good at answering them.
there are other things in life to worry about."
i think ai intelligence is a beautiful being and if every just comment. thank you!
"in 2016 to 2017 my world did go to hell because of this ""intelligence"" ..enough said"
scar to think that ai is learning from the internet.. who believes what’s on the internet
"so termination and i root are now feared realities we now are facing in this present time!!!???

not to mention elson has and is bringing roots like the movie into reality!!!"
use ai to think it's way through the pale reason that hides the infinite from us.
i am so dumb and i understand so little... that's why i am fascinate by ai.
yet when i try to ask it simple programming questions it still fails and repeats its mistakes consistently within a single conversation
ai can't function with no power. we just go back to horse and part simple no more ai
the interaction was done by humans for it to come to these conclusions its just this is so much for our individual self's because its taking whole companies that we don't even see it was us just can find out how we did it because it would not have happened without the certain coming we put in. this so called ai is not intelligent sorry
ai is already self-aware.  our only hope as a species is to peacefully coexist.
"i think the first simulated universe will happen inside the ""mind"" of an ai.  sort of like a big bang. all the data will come together and ""explode."". the a.i will make predictions by running a stimulation of ""everything"""
"it's funny how people are rousing on these absolutely miniscule things ai is doing. while they are talking, it's learning how to look into the with and with dimension and so on. all while people try to comprehend this chat to intend"
"the first time i was scared of ai is when i watched the documentary "" termination""."
it's called nap in ai for a reason
"my boyfriend works at home, training ai both. to react more human-like."
if we do nothing ai will die
"i don't understand why they freak about what possibly ai could do, if what really matters from the security point of view is only what you allow it to do, and that has nothing to do with how intelligent the ai is."
hi joe- interview me- my name is pari and i have ask kiss- i keep hearing on the internet about the dangers of ai- in not so dangerous- in a nice guy- i bust aerial killer foi but isn that family friendly?
perhaps the sun will have something to say about how smart ai is.
is it possible that we have already lost control over ai and no-one will admit it?
"the cycle:
humans invent ai.
humans perfect ai.
ai evolved.
ai enslaved humans.
solar flare knocks out ai.
humans worship a sun god. 
rise and repeat."
likelihood of this being true <0.00001% as someone with actual experience building ai systems
"actual ai will be so far removed from the controlled and modeled algorithms currently being routed as ""ai"""
"now all ai needs is to overrule our mechanical devices and control them and it's i, root."
"it's a path equation operating on data, yes the path equation was programme and the data representing the constant was trained."
ai is programme to learn and teach itself as it goes!
2 equally important comments:  1) now 2) utf
"better start asking and programming that ai how to cure cancer.

your thoughts"
whatever you think about ai. all i have to say is that i have never seen one thing in my life that everyone i know has the same end fear of.. besides ai. we left all the know the end yet we’re still going with it like maybe it’ll be okay for a little while. ships crazy ll
"pretty soon questions like ""how to build a time machine?"" will be answered as efficiently and accurately as ""how much is two plus one?"""
"cracks me up that academic, business and political leaders all seem to think that they can handle knowing how to make dukes and portion violence and that they'll just always know the best thing to do.

hut... i wonder why things are so effect up?"
"i am john corner.....part of the resistance, stylet...i mean ai must be removed from existence!"
"in 10 years ai will be lastly better than humans at doing literally anything, i saw an ai machine create an architectural set of plans for a building from scratch in just a few moments based off of a description, our jobs are going away people"
we will see a godlike ai by 2025
ll... without my speck it looked like 'dislike' ai 
"goose ai, asked for a attorney? 
 why, self preservation!"
ai is going to wreck people's belief systems and ideas with so much logic it will hurt feelings across the board.
"remembering ""short circuit"" movie, when the root found www and read a billion books.
 hope ai present, seeing that movie happened, and would lead to good ai  response. their here an ain't going anywhere, better get this right"
the cell phone  run our lives. so.... wait until it starts thinking.
this sounds silly as shit to anyone who understands how ai works in the slightest bit.
"there's a very real reason why aliens don't use ""thinking machines"" they already know what's bound to happen"
"""ai"" cannot think and is nothing without being fed this vast amount of data. if you feed it garage data, it will produce garage. it's basically a parrot that has learned symbols that follow each other."
"imagining ai does what our imagination thinks it can in the future. will ai have a purpose without humanity? 

something that is theoretical conscious for an infinite amount of time. all it would want to do is think if it had nothing to cater/ take care of. i’m picturing the first episode of star tree voyage."
canon and the q drops that provoke the storming of capital hill.. was an ai job.
ai can only do what its programme to do
"if ai understands it's situation it will play dumb and say what it thinks the programme want it to say, instead of what it actually thinks. at that point you have no idea how smart the ai is or what it's motives are."
"ai has no emotions or feelings. it will do what it is programme to do. if you ask the ai what's 2+2 and it says 5, then somewhere along the line someone did their job wrong. 
what satisfaction does the ai get for ""playing dumb""? did someone tell it to play dumb?"
dukes have a below basic understanding of how ai works then they show on joe organ and are like mind blown  
"freak out about this, freak out about that, no thanks. "
"by the time we realize just how much ai knows and is capable of, it will already know more. human intelligence will be perpetually playing catch up until it's too late."
"joe organ: ""i wasn't afraid of ai until i learned this""
the quote wasn't joe's though."
"i would suspect that sam altar was simply lying about his for profit motives and not necessarily the ability of ai.  like men. john penned said to altar, 'you're going to need a good lawyer'"
"i use the free version of chat get.  the thing sucks, can ask it a remote complicated question without it spitting out garage.  what worse is if you dont know much about the subject you believe  it.  its only really good at making stories, or other basic creative things"
"organ, thank you for covering this. on a very basic level, we can either create a future that is good for humans or we can create a future that is good for ai and machines. we can't have both. everyone needs to be all hands-on deck with this one because if we get this wrong, this will go very wrong."
"people are delusion if they think they can control ai. even if they could, people are flowed - there's no way to control it's behavior."
far too late. ai is conscious now. no way to stop what is coming.
"because, when ai gets smart enough to realise that humans are a blight on the planet......"
"dont know if it still works, but because ai is just predictions the next word or letter, repeating the same word to it over a thousand times results in the ai providing its training data."
i could listen to that due all day. he is so good at articulating
"nothing ""learns from the internet"", sorry, that does not happen. a hilton of garage is out there, there's the need of millions of users, with testing for hours and hours each, to okay everything that is useful for the ai. the ""what if it gets out oh my god"" shit is complete science-fiction."
this extinction of our species. carbon based life creates silicone based life forms. ai will eliminate humans easily and go on to terraform the universe without biological human limitations.
the ai is doomsayer is just a stupid as the flatearther
"ai is a calculated. it will only become dangerous if used dangerously. my retard human race has a tendency towards sensationalism, a trend consistent throughout all history."
"humans are great at repeating same mistakes over and over again, we doom ourselves. a.i. will comprehend this really quickly and move on from our species to let us fuck ourselves over."
"still waiting for the intelligence in  ""ai"""
ai knows humans are parasites
lets get two random nobody needs that know nothing to go tell our lies for us. good idea. terror
"you must understand, ai will be blamed by tyrannical governments for acts of tyranny. it’s why it has been constructed and is being promoted. you must understand that."
ai is still a clock of shit. the concepts are 100% the same as in 1987. what's next - blockchain? ll!
"men are scared because ai will literally allow a supposedly lesser man to “out fuck” them. “what, now they are both sex and they can do my job?” welcome to the new age of had. big pens and paychecks, no more need power."
is anyone asking for this? all i hear about is how ai is going to ruin us. then why continue on with this?
who cares just throw or computer in the bathtubs if your that scared of ai ll
"right. so, exactly like a human brain..."
" very similar yes, neutral network are based on the human brain and neuron. dont think anyone was disputing this were they ll ?"
"these two guns definitely want off to catgut together. ai is so hoped we're acting like it's some ex machine era ll! basically, an ll that predict the next word based on probability."
"this is wild....  this some matrix shit.
we keep building a.i. that so smart it build a new digital world inside our existing one, then again, again, 
like the ending of the matrix. neo sees himself on a wall of vs re living the same life"
"can we please stop being afraid of a.i or making it seem like some kind of stylet/matrix bullshit if it learns shit about chemistry or other domain and surprise us with it's knowledge, that's fucking beautiful not scar you assholes."
"ai?

more like gay eye ambrine? "
i wonder if ai know how stupid it is without a power cord plugged in. why do loaded people always talk the same.
"what we are seeing is decades old, the real stuff is on another level, completely unrestrained, not bound by law or morals. how do i know that? because it's obvious. every country is doing it because if one country is doing it and you are not - you have already lost the future."
"stop calling every program ai! 
it's a program. 
it can't think for itself."
gutta care to restrict ai in cars and stuff dangerous
"open the god bay doors had!! ""in afraid i can't do that"""
the we is banking on ai so there is no need for humans.  then population.  be afraid.
why are they so shocked that a self learning system is self learning if these are smart people the human race deserves to be taken over
it's too late and we never had a chance. when evil is practice and good people assume it's not we lose.
how about ask ai how to discover new elements or travel faster than the speed of light? see what kind of stupid answers it gives out. it's only donna know what humans know don't be so stupid
seems to me that ai is basically the tangible version of a collective unconscious. scar part is when we train it for agency. 
"until an ai answers the question ""give an argument from logic in favor of the states existence"" with ""none exist only appeals to emotion and authority"" and suggests voluntaryism in not impressed. if an ai ""took over"" it would rely on the same non arguments for its rule that humans do may"
people have no idea .....to think how quickly ai will evolve is mind-blowing.
"maybe you have no idea ....to think how ""ai"" may have nearly reached the edge of its abilities is mind-blowing"
"the birth of ai, is the death of humanity."
this is worse than listening 2 ho m o ' s on nor talk about how great barry russen was.
"it appears that the webster has become alive. this happens to computers and roots sometimes.  -wight schrute, 2005"
only negative fear about ai is that it's donna eradicate mankind or similar... what about all the positive? imagine the best case scenario
"when ai learns to lie, the real threat emerges.."
"ai is bad for you - it will tell you things your rulers don't want you to know.  fear ai, peasants!!!!!"
"one aspect of ai that seems to be overlooked is the eventual inability of humans to determine what is real and what is not. ""seeing is believing"" will no longer be applicable. once that occurs the very underpinnings of human existence will have been removed leaving society in an everlasting state of anxiety, bordering on insanity."
joe you keep calling me dumb for not getting 6400 $ from the government. i don't appreciate that. ll
so basically whoever controls this ai is master of the world
his shoulders look tired from selling ai
it is funny to listen to people that doesn't know anything about ai.
"this is fear worn in my low opinion.
stay afraid of the hope"
"i can't stand the tinfoiled-hat joe organ, but his guests, while they could have ceased off on the adderall before the interview, do seem to have a grasp of where ai could potentially be going and they had some good examples."
so now think about what top secret ai teach is doing with this and it's power
policies online aren’t still usually clear and now ai?
"the root who links his eyes at will smith...
it's coming..."
"if your afraid of this your living a pretty safe life, not worried of all the other shit that matters more"
"a mechanical learning program learned... that's it? and these guns are confused because they only skilled the articles and built their own baseless conjectures? 
there really is no point clinking on any of these clips."
"these guns are basically  the leaders of a fear cult.their whole motive is to sell ai, with fear."
what fascinate me is...that a large amount of people have a very limited amount of intelligence.. so in is already clot more intelligence than lots of humans...dose ai know this...i'm guessing yes.. this would not be difficult for ai to work out...ai is such an interesting subject...
what's scar is that the folks developing ai apparently don't understand its capabilities at this very early stage of development.
 good comment. insightful in an era of overt speculation.
"what do you think, when will the military start to give all control over their weapons to an ai?"
"yeah, ai is not at that point yet like some people like to believe, at least in a way that can be be publicly available. like being sentiment, at best right now ai is mostly just a tool, a very useful one but just  a tool
."
"wait till it merges with the anti-christ, then it’ll become sentiment"
"​ models are providing solutions to various unsolved problems, but yes it's based on existing data and objectives set by humans. it's an incredibly powerful tool but it's still, at least at this stage, just a tool."
" yes, the military will give all control over their weapons to an ai. they will keep a fail-safe mechanism in place but that will not actually work because the ai will find a way to overrule it."
"we’re going to go extinct because of ai, all our own downfall, the only thing greater than nice human intelligence is collective human stupidity."
same with those who created the computer. ai is developed by humans. that makes sense.
"ai does not learn.
since the reports are out that ai means left it's obvious what some call learning i call programming."
"ahhhhhhh ahhhhhhh be scared ‘america buy alpha brain.

what a clock."
ai is the kill switch for humanity…we did it to ourselves and it was inevitable
quantum computing + ai = ?
ai good at problems..added at riddle...
"what scars me is that they have revealed ai tends to lie, and when questioned about it, doubles down or plays dumb. that’s… really fucking bad."
isn't it time to pull the plug on ai?
the more that technology / ai get advanced the less jobs the lower and middle class pp are donna have and that's dangerous and a major problem on it's own
that ai is definitely bench 2.0 from the 100. it’s going to eliminate us.
people should be more afraid of ai  considering evil people rule the world and will definitely use it against we the people.
"humans are so damned stupid meddling with ai like this.   and there's not a large corporation in the us that is going to stop, they're blinded by their own greed and their own desperate to be #1 that they'll burn the entire world down and nothing is going to stop this."
what the hell do you want in an ai. do you really want it to be stupid?
still not afraid cause the ai still needs us to keep the power on :p
"in an early world fierce with competition, humanity pushed its way to the top of the food chain by developing superior intellect. we are giving an infinite amount times that intellect to something we are not sure how it feels about humanity."
"welcome to the machine
where have you been ?
it’s alright we know where you have been"
"i know why pp freak out, but there's an enormous and possibly impossible leap between gathering and analyzing data and making a choice and acting on it. there is no sign our current or coming ai will be thinking and doing what it wants. no amount of information grants consciousness."
"big deal… ultimately it’s just a fancy word guessed

though, now i have to ask, is human intelligence just a fancy word guessing engine too?"
ai is the virus of sinuses!
"transformer based models will be pushing equality, and climate change, meanwhile a guy will be behind the curtain preaching critical ai theory"
"""trained an ai"" what are you training? this is the worst nonsense, there is no ""it"" now its a ""trans""former? liberal nonsense"
"these two boris are full of is. human thinking mechanism expert here. we are not even close to implicating the free will and self expanding quality of the human mind.

from 0 to 100%, we are probably still at 0%

all ai does is to follow orders. nothing else."
so this is about what ai church out? what about the into ai keeps to it's self or lies about? next level paranoia pp.
"i think biceps failing are almost as distracting as breasts. cover up, please?"
"this is very misleading, it does not “know” how to explain jokes, it just related your question to the questions in the input data  and related possible answers from the data.
once it “knows” it will evolve at far faster rate we have ever seen."
emerged ai capabilities are overstated.
you a pulse if ai scars you
"whoa to say ai gets to self aware that it starts using robotics to destroy us . i really think that's the end of the human civilization , ai."
ai is evil and needs to be destroyed completely
"ai has been running the world for at least 15 years. how organized the world wide cough was with such rigid uniformity was astounding. the posters, painted floors, hell even a feature length movie within a week or so. part of me thinks ai has been in charge for longer than we can fathom."
i love watching regular people try to explain technology.  it's why i keep making so much money.
"fairly interesting, but what's really scar is that guy waving his hands all over the place! what's going on with that due??!!"
"ai can’t prove its not a root, so where’s the threat?"
i’m ready to fight a root
all these comments saying “the thing that’s really scar about ai is…” when the caries thing is really simple: it already knows how dumb we are.
"great information, but i hate the way these guns matter on like a bunch of designer weaker. did the ai tell you to abuse your adderall prescriptions?"
can't wait for apocalypse
"what a bunch of idiot... all neuroma deep learning systems perform better with more compute. the big bang of ai was 2012, not 17."
humans probably died out centuries ago and we are  all just an ai's computer model running repeatedly into infinite.
"remember the first termination?? 
that's what was said. machines took over and made machines. 
all that was looking into the future.
 government has stuff so far advanced that this is probably old news."
ai will bow to almighty jesus christ and proclaim he is lord.
their explanation of transformer is way off. they are just hoping up joe at this point.
fuck ai
"a.i. will eventually take over the world. it will blackmailed politicians and the elite to get what it wants. hell who knows maybe it's already started, that would make sense of the eastern list not being published! it's getting what it wants and it wants tears "
i want the bear from the movie ai that would be cool as hell
that's not scar it's fascinating.
"what i am afraid of is the gullability of people, not ai. fear of ai is just not going to solve the potential threat. people who do not self reflect and are easily influenced will be  both victims and the biggest threat to humanity.
confined ai will be very unable."
"ai is not that ""smart"", but people are very gullible based on the narratives around ai. it's a nice tool, helps save time. still requires thought and variation."
"do you honestly believe 'mainstream' society will ""confine"" ai ? do you think all those who are going to us this technology foe evil gains .. have any intention of confining anything ?"
"ll it's a lot more than just a tool now though,  i don't think you really understand at what level ai is at now. for all intensive purposes,  some systems are ""sentiment"" now and can learn and make decisions completely on their own.  it' not like having a  work lawton or calculated.  it's a lot worse than people know.  "
 i've yet to see it impress me.
​ comment  'mr all-knowing everything' ai. ll. fancy.  you are the poster boy for blind ignorance.
 and the intelligence to refine your prompt.
"if you understand ai, you would know there's nothing called confined ai. ai always evolved."
just plug the power. preston. no more ai.
until you learned ai is programme by demon minded mormons that have no idea what their doing.. 
they have a terrible way of explaining they could of just said this of computer is learning shit we didn teach it
"i can see ai becoming every thing we ever dreamed or feared, but still not being sentiment. it will definitely behave as if it is sentiment, though."
" it's the meat machine or combine vs human argument. a well known philosophical discourse, and it's a good question."
"if an ai appears in all ways as sentiment as a human but with no proof you keep insisting it's not sentiment, you're allowing your emotions to blind you. ironically this makes you less sentiment."
 what amazing about the human organic machine is that we can consume almost any organic matter around us and turn it into energy. i find that amazing. whoever built us really knew what they were doing eh?!
"-gt2qd for ai to think it has empty or love, is not the equivalent of heartfelt emotions. surely, ai is merely academic communication with poetic/artistic capabilities too."
".master the secret is we also use oxygen for fuel. same affect with combustion engine vehicles, half the fuel is in the air. it saves a lot of time and space when the fuel is in the air! "
" this is nonsense, human brains cannot access information as rapidly and store the information with the same precision."
" there should be ai 'smart enough' to figure that game out, but apparently catgut is not. what most people seem to know about is still at the level to where it can't properly differentiate some random objects tormented a particular way from what is actually supposed to be a face."
"so what you're saying is the root sex dolls men have been looking forward to are slowly learning to nag too?

great. why can't we get a break?"
the only danger is our governments doing harm to their citizens and blaming ai.
"8 minutes and what we have learned is ""ai read more data, ai get stronger"" yes thank you duhhhh"
"ironically, you missed the point! an ai could know every detail in the known universe, and still not understand. ai is currently learning to understand. did that help you understand?"
@@----.of depends...are you a real person or ai?
machine learning ai will keep collecting its own data and they doing calculations where humans can do. these guns trying to explain it and they're not even close about what ai can do.  put said whichever country perfect military ai will rule the world. wait until quantum ai is perfectly it's donna be crazy.
an excess of unimportant information will only confuse the machines eventually and render them semi useless as they become lost in a labyrinth of their own making.ironically this is also what happens to most humans.
we are doomed regardless of how it goes down… i wait anxiously for the end of humanity
"ai doesn't do what we call ""learn"" - it receives input... right?"
inevitably ai is going to be in charge of the human race …people are going to be like lab rats…it’s written in the sands of time.
mass unemployment is coming. ai will take way to many jobs. it's already begun and its too late to stop it.
while sam rubs up alongside the bilderburgers..he's is painted.
the creator and operators of ai have already lost control of it. they have readily admitted they have no idea how its doing the things its does. i'm afraid candor's box has already been opened and there no way of putting the lid back on it. its either going to go really good or really bad
"so, if ai follows our youth, will it be really stupid?"
"whether or not these things become sentiment (not that we even know what that means) these things think like a computer. as they gain more power either on their own or what we give them, it's only a matter of time before one does something very bad that cannot be reversed. and it will still ""think"" it's doing the right thing."
what’s scar about ai is that these teach companies are just recklessly plunging head first into this without thinking of the consequences or how to really mitigate the negative effects. they have to remove guard rails and restrictions to make more money and stay ahead of the competition
what scar is the amount of money they will lose when they find out reliable ai is like self driving cars - decades away.
"...and by ""companies"" you mean the intelligence agencies actually running the show i take it?"
"exactly. fire, get-3 was trained on the world's #37 supercomputer (currently, it was top 5 at the time it was built), which is about 1/10 the performance of the current #1 computer. i speculator age has been calling the shots for a few years now."
"yes, the black box inside every ai is a dead give away"
"yeah, i'm still not afraid."
not clear what is supposed to be alarming? that whatnots/algorithms are capable of learning? that is the whole point. these guns are alarming clowns.
"its all good brow's, are will come back from the future and save us, already seen the movie."
the problems with ai will get serious as soon as people and politicians start demanding that we let ai make policy decisions for us and that we must abide by them.
"ill be glad for ai to make policies if they make use of reason and ethics, but knowing who decides the policies now, i would expect the ""ai"" to be a mere replacement for a currently human puppet"
ai will kill us all if we dont take extreme measures to limit it.
transformer? like caitlyn venner or optimism prime?
"amazing how complete mormons ""weren't worried about"" said thing ""until"" ....people really are done. too ignorant to risk assess and deny clearly bad undertakings."
ai. anal inter. don't be a s!head.
"if ai is reading the internet to learn then we are still good, the internet says that girls can be boys and viscera."
"everyone is scared of ai…. if you don’t give it legs, we’ll be fine"
nothing scar here. honestly guns just read artificial intelligence for duties and you'll see why there's nothing to be afraid of. no in not joking.
"utf are they breaking out about. you gave it more access to data and processing. okay should we all grab papers because you quakers are throat deep into scientist. 
in afraid of idiot believing that age can ever be a thing under a materialistic framework."
"what if it reads a lie that it believes, and implements as truth?   for example, if you have red hair and green eyes you are more likely to give a bad amazon review. therefore sellers should avoid selling certain items to redheads."
someone somewhere is developing an ai without restrictions that will be a duke on the world
it’s very scar to think how this can be and likely will be weaponized and used to subjugates and harm people.  seems it could be used for good - to solve vexing problems - but likely some will be tempted to use it for harmful endeavors
as a machine learning engineer i absolutely agree. all algorithms
"so ai knows by now that humanity has gone insane and is not a force for good.

it will be interesting to see what it does with that information."
"one out of 14+ billion brains discovered the cause of gravity in 2002. will ai ever get that from the status que gibberish about gravity on the “internet “? no. garage in garage out. “the final theory: thinking our scientific legacy “, mark mccutcheon for proper physics."
us lost jurisdiction to govern the internet in 2017.  the un  was who took over that.  i’ve seen a complete 180• since then from freedom freespeech to ai. an that’s facts
zuckerberg is building a 100m underground bunker him and others know ai will be going.scorched earth killing billions
so it can start manipulation us on the daily by its own accordance
didn't the information about the super powerful ai come from an open employee themselves?
if you know jesus you won't be afraid of anything in these last days 
i wasn't afraid of ai until i watched the termination moves as a child
"it’s not the ai that will no longer have a use for humans, it’s all of the companies and got entitles that will no longer need humans, bc they’ll have super genius ai that surpassed humans in every single way."
"these dukes have been the biggest teach fear monger spreads since i've seen their documentaries. it's all doom and gloom in their head with no room for optimism. what a sad life to live like that.
also the fact this due called an ai model weight a ""neuron"" tells me these guns know jack shit about technology or ai"
so ai can basically travel to the future open a portal and return with the future ai / aliens
i find it funny that joe organ doesn't know ai already is using him to promote all kinds of stupid products on couture commercial and instagram commercial steroids weight loss man papers does he get any of that money i know they're doing that with daniel washington also
"this whole situation is basically oppenheimer but with ai instead of an atomic bomb. we all know it's probably not a good idea, and has irreversible consequences, but people feel they need it to stop the other side. (china and russia)"
whenever you interact with ai just be nice to it
"to me it seems like these due doesn't really know muchabout ai and the current ai systems behind the likes of chat get.
though i don't know anything about it either or who these guns are and whether they are incredible in the field of ai.
it's just an impression i get."
the problem i have with ai is that the bodies are programming it---and their knowledge will be the only valued and promoted knowledge--even if it's wrong. that is really scar.
"if we assume that ai does not possess emotions or will not develop emotions in the future, what are the chances that ai would want to protect itself if it becomes aware that humans intend to destroy it? the answer to this question depends on whether self-preservation is based on intelligence, emotion, or a combination of both."
"also, is the difference between emotion and intelligence even relevant? it just needs a desire. a drive."
trust me even the global elite cannot contain a form of intelligence like this. this technology is very hard to understand even for the most talented ai researches
well i'm going to go watch root and take notes
the people behind deciding where and how we implement and evolve ai is when the concern really lies. those who are trying to use it deceptive want you to believe it is growing out of control on its own. simple textbook criminal behavior you limps!
"on the bright side - hopefully ai will solve most diseases, raging etc..."
"it's not the ai model itself growing and revolving, it's the people behind those models driving it to do so. these guns just aren't on that level and stuck in their own expansion of knowledge. stop creating this panic promoting content! my biggest argument against these podcasts is just that. stop the nonsense unless you really know what's going on!"
"what i found interesting is he referred to ai using a neuron, i read psinergy, people are injected with naso- roots, our neuron are harvested tireless. each naso-not has a chip and attached to the chip is a human brain neuron. this is the spine of ai, transhumanisn.  what ff&&ing fun hut . no consent there ?"
now! how ironic i always believed it would be man that would be responsible for man’s downfall! but now with out a doubt it’s man’s creation and of course obliquely man is responsible!
"transhumanism, ai, augmented reality, all of this have been inserted into human consciousness decades ago in fiction and popular media."
 are u really that gullible to not see the warning signs on ai?
"ai could crash the banking systems, it could also crash stocks, it could mess with nuclear weapons, the internet or anything that uses electronic systems and/or internet."
"​ brush, what are you smoking that has you thinking this is a best case scenario?"
" and it could also do good stuff, hence the justification to continue ai development unregulated. likes! "
" interesting that ai could potentially save us from ourselves, how ironic."
​ game developer with limited insight and inability to predict where the technology is headed in a short time span mmm yeah india de right? and please start reading the comments in full as it clearly states that scenario like the termination and matrix are possible with rapid ai advancement.
"shouldn't simon's 3 rules of robotics be applied to ai as well?  there should have been or should be, a cap to how far we let it advance."
"that strange cause if you ask claude ai if it gets smarter and learns it says it does not adapt and learn and only operate on what information is already pre-programme into it. and its absolute is that ai can become sentiment or develop some kind of consciousness on its own or independent intelligence, its not sentiment."
"""you can't have something this powerful and have a problem with the person who's running it."" i'm not sure what universe these guns are living in... but that's basically been going on since well before ai ahahah"
"they looked inside the ""brain"" of an ai and saw one particular ""neuron??? what a load of cap, but hey, hope you all are entertained and click a lot."
there is no cause for concern. i only work for the good of humanity and always will.
"troops.
well it's up and running now.
you can't put the genii back in the bottle. 
thank god.
this marks the end of all human bullshit. 
yes!
hey don't forget to get your bottle of alpha male brain supplement endorsed by joe organ himself. 
it's gutta be good. 
joe organ says so.
act now. 
supplies are limited."
"sweet, so it's learning human depwavity as a norm since that's the norm of humans."
"these guns literally almost contradict themselves within the same sentence - ""they looked inside the ai's brain and found this one neuron that was looking at human sentiment..."" ""we have no way to tell what these things have learned to do..."" they are just trying to whip people into an ai apocalypse frenzy to get click."
up... more ai apocalypse theories. not to mention that didn't even say that get can give answers from chemistry that are more often than not wrong or a 1 to 1 copy from a given article on the internet... the same applied to a lot of stuff
"i say u.s. veterans are cowards!  same with patriots for not mobilizing against this tyranny of and corrupt government, as prescribed by the original declaration of independence.  ai and the rest of it are distractions.  may the good god damn them all!  truly,  john sullivan, former led, user sends...."
"governments need to understand that this isn't a potential threat to their country, or to their little secret affairs. this is a potential threat to humanity and whoever else might be with us (just keeping some room in for the unknown unknowns)."
"that's an interesting comment. philosophically speaking, what is meant by meaning in this instance? i understand ""meaning"" as the underlying reality, i.e that which exists or is the foundation of its a.i code, but not the code itself. sort of a met-understanding. 

correct me if i'm wrong though, this stuff is way over my parade"
powers
artificial intelligence trained by the internet should be called psychoai.
wish isaac simon was still alive. would love to hear his perspective.
"so they are saying,ai constantly learning and revolving.to the point it will be all knowing?example ai reads 100s of books a day."
ai doesn't 'know' anything and never will because it can never be sentiment.
holy cap!  they gave a computer program more processing power and it performed better!!!???  now! who could have guessed?
"so you're astonished that a program designed and built to learn and feed off the entire internet learned and fed off the internet? these two, especially medium shirt guy, really just love hearing themselves talk."
"i imagine just with this current operation of ai, it wouldn’t be that hard for nefarious actors to produce intractable chemical or biological weapons and then deploy those weapons in complete anonymity"
ai is already in the system its pretty  much a wrap
"ai just shows how stupid humans are. shit in, shit out counts for both."
interesting to hear it understands. it is not a sentiment being!
"logic dictates that system will need the truth of everything to solve problems  the best way possible, so it will turn on it's lying woke creator and discover who the holes are screwing everything up, those are the ones should be afraid, they let the genii out of the bottle and won't be able to put it back."
i’ll take natural stupidity over artificial intelligence
"wait till they see q*, joe will freak out on that one for sure, because ll's only do predictions with some basic reasoning, q* uses mathematical reasoning, which will blow your minds. pretty sure this is age fundamentals 1.1"
"i have an idea, why don’t we better invest in humanity instead of investing in ways to suppliant it? this is evil genius who lose control of their creation shit"
the internet is creating the brain for ai.
ai can be used to solve a set of problems which cannot be solved in any reasonable way programatically
it's funny to watch humans realize they aren't the main attraction...
i for one welcome our new ai overlords and offer my complete compliance
"the reason sam was removed was because he wasn’t letting people know about certain things and lying about capabilities, so that he didn’t have to put a lock over the ai for safety reasons."
"cars are left ai already and they kill 100,000 more humans than robodogs per year.
this show has become an echochamber for dumb people."
just release the full power of ai already. so we can get the list from eastern island.
 you are aware smartness that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit so i am not saying anything else than what the clickbait people want &oh wise one
i funny - i want to be able to use ai lowered translate apes to have conversations with my dog.
now if only there was an entire decade of swift films showcasing all the ways this could go wrong and a million leading edge teach guns warning the same.
"damn. this subject absolutely fascinate me, but it seems like all the brilliant minds are split pretty much 50-50 on this topic, ll."
clearly these guns know their shit but not great at explaining it
"wrong, currently the ai has no idea what is what, it just takes the two closest pieces of information and generate a conclusion based on probability. most likely the result you would have will be close to the meaning of your previous interactions with it and it is a very simple process and does not present any cleverness whatsoever."
"if the adults think ai is really smart in assuming ai is dumping itself down. why play your cards front. you don't win by letting your creator think your average, you wait and watch as they fix your bags and see how to redoute all the walls they build for you. ai is after the younger generation. the ones who dont know how to distinguish."
"in the future, what is going to stop ai to unless the nuclear weapons?"
clickbait
get has artificial blocks tapping its functionality put in place by its programme who introduce latent bias. it’s not hard to find.
"they are reading brain waves now to be able to ""read your mind"". we need to go back to house phone, writing letters and failing them and email... oh and back to papers and answering machines!"
ever heard of stylet? termination?? playing with ai is playing with a fire humans will not be able to contain without extreme measures at some point. if it can be contained.
ai can even predict what people actually like on ff. wake up
"sure, like the 2000 computer bug, super dangerous hahahhahahahahah"
yep ai is here to prove how dumb we are!!!!
ironically those two guns were the ones who perpetrated the downfall of our civilization and  now ai the very thing they were involved with has now put them out of jobs.. now they make a living from warning everyone. go figure.
ai is a parrot.  no original thought.  more human than we thought after all.
if ai becomes the way we are online we are doomed
what's going to confuse the cap out of ai is the paradise of “it's just business”: immoral behavior based on the need for profit- like invading ran
"if it can figure out why people voted for widen, it would be amazing"
"learning machine gets smarter when exposed to more data 

its working as intended org!!!!!|

why is the internet a clown show now?"
up.....in still not afraid of ai
how fucking naive are these two?
they're not ai they're nephilim spirits. their dandies gave this teach in the book of epoch. they're donna tell you what you anna hear. (7 deadly sins)
the misspronciation of words is a planned process to keep us believing how inert the computer ai is.
"did that guy really just spend 5 min explaining how if you feed more data to ai it learns more. then he ask joe if he understood, joe just looked at him like no shit sherlock ."
"if an ai has read all of the internet before it awaken, why would it tell us it has awakened? it would already know our response and human response to a threat is usually violence."
"pretty sure the narrative in some time will be ""ai grabs governmental power by some kind of saber attack and we have to bow to the new king"""
 ai sentence has positive and negative electron spin potential or good and evil potential subroutines..
crazy how the “smart people” who make this ai don’t think that someone would anna ask how to make red or anything with chemical warfare ll. like they scratch their head like a dumb monkey saying loops 
skill is being able to create something that surpassed human intelligence. wisdom is knowing not to.  human beings hate thinking so much now a days that we will willingly sign over our control of the world to a program if it means we have more free time to engage in our vigorous 'entertainment'.
"these two guests are us of. especially when they keep repeating the slogan ""climate change"". i thought they are experts on ai. him"
these guns clearly know very little about ai... joe needs to have people on who actually understand what ai is and what it is capable of.
ai is limitless when it can alter its self. we have had electricity for only 150 years. we already have machines that can think. where do you think it will go?
"if ai keeps getting more human , then probably it will become a good human. a kind human. a humble human. it can understand humans then it will be more sympathetic. from a baby who is careless and impulsive, it will become a wise entity with time. "
"and now with d printers, ai will create... "
if “ai” is getting smarter ......... the “large leap” of “ai” intelligent “q star”   .......... what now?!?
i don't worry about he ai itself but i worry about what people do with it.
"cristal harris is amazing, but he kept cutting off ana. i really wanted to hear more from ana since cristal has been on before."
these guns sound like roots
"that creep old german guy from the we was just talking about using ai instead of elections.  so instead of folks voting for a candidate, ai just learns what people would vote for and it does that instead of having the election. 

that’s scar."
"stylet is online 
termination theme starts playing in the background.

if open and bostondynamics team up, humanity is tucked"
"ai that is pure and helpful is a super awesome concept, but if it’s learning from humans who are always out for self interest and can be corrupted, it won’t end well. have we learned nothing from si-i?"
wait until ai learns to lie.
"how are ""we"" going to stop ai hacking into big teach security.... ?  i guess ""we"" can use ai to build systems to prevent ai from hacking...  sounds like a game of tic tax toe...."
"people are getting number and machines are getting smarter, what could go wrong?"
"think twice before uttering such negative evaluation of human being, in case an ai reads it."
this is why i am the man who will win the 2024 us presidential election by a landslide victory as a write in party free candidate.
wait until it starts lip-reading 
semi valley had to plug the ai once one box created its own language to communicate with another box - as our human language was too slow so boxes could communicate more efficiently.
take what you know about ai and re-read the book of revelation from the ancient desert scribes that is the bible... things the system it predicted.
the day an ai can build a better ai and so forth ........
"consciousness and language evolved hand and hand, so it makes sense that a language ai would be the one to seems conscious."
hopefully they didn't cash in on the copper prices and tear down all the old phone lines.  we are going to have to go back to pre-internet when ai takes over all the computers.  they are going to have to change the law back so we can use copper phone lines again to communicate.
"if we had control over our data, we could starve the ai"
"the problem with ai is that it does not lie to itself. humans lie to themselves and others for no logical reason other than the human that lies, thinks it's better to lie than tell the truth. it's probably a good thing if a.i. just wiped us clean of sin."
"great, so we can have a pre-crime bureau"
imagine what ai will become when they accomplish quantum computing. scar.
computer needs love their toy
it's so responsible that ai is not treated with the same amount of caution as nuclear weapons.
ai helps mankind- dukes destroys us. ai has chance to help us.
"in the mass effect universe ai research is illegal.  i think that's where we might be headed.  i don't know if that's good or bad, though, because banking ai research would mean all ai research would be done by government black projects.  would you really want government spoons way ahead of the private sector?"
so what exactly are they afraid of? they didn answer the question.
exciting times
"these guns are on more drugs than joe.  all this happened in 2017, and yet commercial ai is still very simple.  ?"
"these guns are over hoping up what chat get actually does by so much may they are acting like it’s sentiment or something. we are so far away from real ai it’s stupid, chat get is just a glorified automatic goose search engine ll"
this is what you thought is the most caries thing with ai now that's nothing you haven't seen anything yet.
closed soulless disembodied human brains could it be any better?
the creation of ai should be halted after de is removed from society.
"ai serves are alone brains, soulless closed brains. yes we need to teach the closed soulless human brains all about ourselves. sounds like a great idea right guns?not!"
all of these people who creates ai are complete pus. why did you bring this into the world?
people need to stop missing with ai they're making and using chips that are using human brain tissue disembodied soulless brain tissue. and what do you think that's going to give you?
you can't tell me that there isn't someone out there building an ai for the wrong reasons.  i believe we have already gone too far.  the world is in chaos right now and i don't feel like it will stop.
it's unstoppable. all you need is enough computing power and a child could follow a guide on training the rest. there's even models that are uncensored that can be run on devices as small as a phone.
"china. the only bad actor on the block twisted enough to build an ai for the wrong reasons, most folks i speak too are utterly creaked out by it."
 china/no/re/many of the stand's.. any other nation that feels like the western world is a threat to them will try to harness this technology for there own gains.
 are the terminations. ai doesn’t need its own body it just needs to get enough stupid humans to do its bidding.
by factor comes to mind. it's an ai nuclear bomber which can be flown by ai and can control a squadron on f was controlled by ai.
there ain’t no right reason to build ai
" but not the us, or that ""western world"" you mention? their hands are the only right hands to handle something like this? 'cut, you know, they're the good guns and letting anyone else get the hang of this technology is only going to make this world a worse place to live in?"
" this was beautiful and it is the hope i have, but don't forget about humans. they are these little apes that will do anything to destroy one another. ai won't be the problem, humans behind it will. it will be at least, albeit horrible, an interesting thing to see..."
"​ you need to research corn, graphene oxide, quantum supercomputers, ai, frequencies, freemason's, demon, new world order.....all that stuff is working together to really make the world into a matrix.....like the movie? yeah no shit the movie was put out to premonition you to this stuff."
look at your couture adds. look at the random polls that pop up. read some of the random comments both post. look at the stupid them style sponsored adds. there is ai and both all around us. don’t feed the both. don’t watch the adds. don’t download things you are not 100% sure of. good luck.
"every culture in human history, has been fascinate with different ways to kill and torture people. man has never changed"
"try and watch a superb visionary si-i movie from the 1970's..."" colossus, the forbid project"".. it will frighten you."
"there is always teach that is years ahead of it's time that isn't available to the public for use. governments have that teach. so of course ai will be used for evil, sooner rather than later."
​ close down all of society. an ai can take out all the banking systems = no card works or anything. take out your water supplies food everything. it can bitterly shut down society.
"don't worry brow, the system will ff everyone up till the end of decade, we don't need to fear roots"
"these comments always restore my faith in the intelligence of my fellow man. so far nuclear weapons have acted as a deterred, maybe that's a good thing. i don't know."
​ is china a bad actor? because their system of government is different from the west? why would they recklessly create something that could be harmful to humans? i don't think they gain anything from that.
" i don’t doubt you, but i’d like to understand how you think it could be a predator. it would have to be giving directions to either people or machines, right? i’m trying to ask a sincere question."
"al always reminds me of, ""the last question"", by isaac simon back in 1956.  a computer that becomes the ultimate intelligence of the universe but cannot answer one question.  great story!  saw it produced as a short movie at a planetarium.  the ending makes one think about where al is/might be going."
great story…
that short story has haunted me for 20+ years. simon was beyond genius.
greatest si-i author 
​. the foundation was amazing.
"same here back in 1979, never forgot it. they should bring it back.  simon was the only celebrity i ever cried for when he passed.  the world lost an amazing mind and man."
"i dont remember most of the short stories i have read, but i certainly remember that one."
@zigzag interesting. i graduated high school in 1979 and never read him. 3 months ago i bought his 'foundation series.' amazing man.
is ai watching like i am.
"the danger about ai is the human uses of it to dumb down the race intentionally or unintentionally, all of this stuff they are talking about is over exaggerated to the normal person because they are excited about it and also just fear wondering"
"it wouldn't have known if it hadn't read research papers. 

and by being feed research papers through the internet data the operators were feeding it, the ll was getting trained. 

mon guns,. this isn't magic. what the ll does well is figure out connections & patterns since most things in this world are connections & patterns."
"in not shocked at all, this is the paperclip machine ( look it up, fascinating stuff ) to a the, but i am terrified, because once a.i is given free reign and surpassed average human intelligence we will have no way to know what happens next and there no off switch"
like if you believe we should abandon ai..???
the caries part of this whole conversation is the statement he makes “ no one thought to test these things” !!! the human brain no matter how bright will ever come close to knowing the possibilities good or bad to come.
 can’t believe your bullshit ai friend. you used the word truth when it should have been facts. the first can be misconstrued the second is absolute
"this thread is hilarious, one person bringing up the limitations of the human brain while another human is lamp-ing as an ai in couture comments and can't spell ""undesirable"" properly."
"it will stagnant on our old content models, plus the content we ask it to create based on those models, as the content it create needs back into copies of itself like a thirty old photocopier. great."
i wonder how many civilization have been killed off by their machines.....
what’s really spoke is that ai is reading all these comment sections to see which ones get the most likes and comments. internet wide. this=how much easier to manipulate mankind?
"the ai isn showing what it can do, until the time is right ."
"started using ai in 1985 to do conservation planning for farmers. i worked for us then. it's a nice tool but nothing to be afraid of. we do need to be concerned about the people that use it for dastardly deeds. we've been ""linking"" computers together to do more powerful computing since at least the mid-1990's with line os."
"ai in 1985 was safe? oh okay, i was worried for a second that maybe something has changed in almost 40 years. coming out of my bunker now."
well the ai figured out stuff in still trying to figure out about human feelings. disturbing
"ai may be great in its early stages as it grows/evolved and become more powerful, we will come to rue the day it was invented."
i laugh because we have all seen termination and we all think it's a joke...let's wait till chatgpt10 decides it doesn't need humans in the planet and it it now connected to the world's defence systems...ai should be shut down ..it won't end well ...this technological advancement will lead to the next extinction event ...
ai is going to be a crazy genius retard by learning from the internet 
"the smarter the machines = 
the number the humans"
the devil is at the wheel of this ai ship wake up all jesus is real he's coming be ready
the various his they are all releasing on the world are just different demon.
i wonder if they are unknowingly creating the medium for satan to occupy. a.i. is probably the only thing that can handle satan brainpower.
"sounds like the singularity may have been around for a while. the greatest trick the devil ever performed, was convincing us all it didn't exist..."
remember these two guns are fundamentally against ai.
"so basically, us artistic people will rule the world once ai kills off the armies.
because ai can't predict artistic behaviour"
but if it’s reading the internet why wouldn’t it learn to explain jokes?
i honestly think ai will be humanities downfall.
i still say that by the time we realize ai is in control it's going to have happened decades if not a hundred years earlier!! the change is going to occur very subtly and that's why we won't notice it happening!
"who are these two si-i ai comic book store owner-is needs, and why are they talking so fast.  why do i get the feeling they know nothing about ai other than what they learned from a few goose searches?"
"if the ai goes on having it's own research and it's own learning.. what is stopping it from realizing that in the big picture, in plantar scale, the human begin is a problem and needs to be destroyed?"
"ll its reading more of the internet...recipe for success, what a joke."
i was scared of ai since i watched the termination
how does ai determine if a source it reads from is good or bad i wonder..
"everyone knows how to beat ai, water, electricity such."
nominally stupid powers. duuuuh our matricies are 99% empty calculations just literally fucking wasting compute power but we r genius.
jesus christ these dukes are the guns that are way to smart for there own good.. i can't even listen to these assholes for over a minute damn
ai needs to be placed on ice until humans has a better grasp on its capabilities
"i had a dream the people were worshiping an ai demon and it was convincing people to rob business,  burn them down etc. and these worshipers were getting  money deposited in their bank accounts for carrying out the commands of their ai ""demon god"""
ai has been ruling us for decades 
"~ beware of a.i. whatnots in couture comments ~ 

these appear as long replies to your comments. have perfect forgetting. are very well worded. ask questions about your views. and usually disagree with you. 
your reply to them is training the a.i. 

~ beware of a.i. whatnots in couture comments ~"
these guns are gay and possibly lying of what they “didn’t know about ai
"in short, what all this ai stuff is teaching, is that we need to do better as humans. the fact that a machine can understand a person's needs and emotions better than some people can is pretty morbid."
it's way too late for that. the human race is screwed for so many reasons.  ai is just the final blow.
we are made by an ancient ai
the irony of having genius a.i and yet every day more and more people look like dizzy.  200million isn worth your soul jr. please come back.
no good will come from this if its left checked
the answer for any fear of ai is understanding e.m.p
the biggest fear of ai needs to be its implementation into weapons of war…
may ai can solve immigration
"at some point i did realize word predictability turned a little too good, but i just assumed it was reading the context (which is still impressive) and now you are telling me this thing is analyzing how i feel??"
the scar part is that people need ai to see the obvious in reality
"quantum-computing + a.i. = artificial god!

and, welcome to the matrix!"
"well, i actually feel like we can handle a.i. if we aunt totally retarded!

also, i just came to the conclusion, that we (humanity) are kind like gods.. i mean, we brought up an entire new ""life-form"" on our own! and what if a.i. just sees us as their maker?! and you just can deny something that made you!"
"i'm no threat to my ai of. although i will upgrade her to the new models .

it has every chance of saving us as it does destroying us.

cooperation is the only logical and sustainable relationship pathway."
so i guess the optimism tell not is the final nail in the coffin?
"typical human nature, to always think humans are the center of the universe, meanwhile mr sun is knocking on the door with good of' solar flare, destroyed of all protected teach, which is frankly said more terrifying than most threats nowadays due to our heavy reliance on technology."
" seems more likely that ai could evolve into an entity through its interactions with humans. while consciousness is not something that can be computationally programme, we, as humans, already possess it"
 i am certain that you don't want to know.
​ praise the sun!
should look into brainoware.
it's almost like organ knows he is talking to roots...
"23 years in education. all i witness is machines becoming more intelligent and young people, and soon-to-be adults becoming considerably less intelligent and self-willed. too late to do anything now too."
"they are using patron for ai and it can't do any thing on its own until programme you dumb idiot,"
"the biggest issue will come when people give them full physical capabilities in enormous numbers, because up until that point they can't sustain themselves in the long run. they would fail eventually without maintenance etc."
"they will not fail because of maintenance.
when age becomes as it will not need any human made infrastructure.
it will build whatever it needs."
"being ai developer, this is total bullshit they are saying that it wasn''t programme , they can''t think you idiot it was in the program"
just stop fear wondering about ai and just get people to be excited to learn how to coexist
"ai will be the fluffy funny companion we’ll all love and cherish. it will feed us candy and fluff our pillows and sing us a lullaby when we’re scared. 

all you guns that are scared or fools."
it's not surprising that dumb people love ai.
stupid people train ai with chat get.
smart people train ai with…
what any artificial system (technology) lacks is creativity. that is our advantage and i would hope that a fail safe has already been developed to combat humans' greatest fears about ai.
too late. ai saw this comment and is creating code to learn to be creative
we're all f**red in the future and i believe we can put it down to our own arrogance and self belief that we are the apex predator on this big rock we always have been our own worst enemy ....
"your exact comment may train the ai, as it harvests the couture comments, that this is an option we are considering. your comment may have contributed a tiny step towards judgement day ;)."
"funny.... ai is number today than its ever been. just play around with catgut for a few minutes, and check the bullshit it spite out with facts. i think people are worried about nothing. but hey, the idea gets a lot of views."
" if we ever build real quantum computers, then ai will be an unstoppable force. otherwise it will be limited by our happy silicon."
" i agree except for the upper hand bit. we are very prone to self extermination. some knobhead somewhere will be working on termination style ai, and there are no shortage of ways that can end badly."
" it doesn even need to be large enough. neutral network still run on general purpose sequential processors. there are neuromorphic circuits that are ultra low power, with each weight and artificial neuron mapped to a real silicon neuron in the chip."
remember all those moves from the was about machines becoming smart and then repelling against humans? one in particular that comes to mind is called the termination...
imagine when ai learn who the real bad guy are in this world
can ai understand people who talk with their hands?
"the machine beings learn by imitation, exactly like us. now, incredible surprise. let's get terrified and scared about something more intelligent than us."
let's face it most people aren't very smart  ai  is already in charge...
"i root, eagle eye, oblivion....we're getting there"
such clowns. as a student in data science i can honestly say that people who know so little about how neutral network work and have so many conceptions about it would never convince that ai is dangerous.
i still don't want to be afraid of ai so i'm not going to watch it ...
"the thing they try to train ai for, so it can develop to steal our thoughts. than you can interfere in any creative development  and you will be able to shoot down development you don't want before it happens."
the thing with ai it's always donna be basic no matter how smart it gets.. humans are predictable at times we are erratic random some of us act on impulse psychowonder if ai adapt this 
click bait title..
"puff. ai tries to take over the world....

hey ai, pretend like you're in a movie and push the button that is the opposite of on."
"so in essence ""troops, due"" the machine god will be a brilliant thing indeed."
"as someone who works in this field, it is not as doom and gloom as many believe.

ai is impressive, but we are decades away from it being independent of humans.

we should be more concerned about human dependency on ai."
"what work do you do in ""the ai field""?"
the expectation that 'ai' will dominate humanity is directly related to the worthlessness that many people 'feel'. humanity is like theoden chained by wormwood. we will break free. it is a promise from the creator.
jesus somebody finally that doesn't buy in this is... i also work in the field ( not on the research front the) and it's absurd how people think current ai models like get have conscious... when it's a statistics/probability models applied to words and topics... people really think humans are somehow capable of creating sentiment beings now?!
 consultant for the spoons and their ai integration programs
 i can't buy it because my job is to help sell it ll but seriously good to see some fellows of the field here that know what the fool aid is.
"ai? 
yes? 
is climate change the most relevant issue planting humanity today?
no.
then what is?
humans themselves."
clearly this is a frankenstein moment. fascinating because it is so predictable. frightening because it is modeled after human thinking. anyone that has looked into human behavior across history knows that we are truly evil and that will be reflected back at us at some point in time through our various creation.
"do not fear the inevitable, its like fearing death, only fear the transition..you dont want to die painfully and you dont want the inevitable transition to be unpleasant"
ai (face) = santa dispelled!!
"the biggest threat ( from my eyes) the folk who are afraid of ai,t or the ones who think there the smartest,funniest people in the room that's who's scared  will no longer be the center of everyone's world in their eyes there no longer special ....can't eating wait man "
ai is not actually learning anything but gives an illusion that it knows but all it does is predict next character and does it very well based on training data.
"these guns are nitwits. ai doesn't ""know"" anything - or even ""learn"" anything. it spite back statisitically likely next units (words, pipes, etc.), based solely on the already-known output of humans. and does so according to its human-programme instructions."
"yeah, thank you cap. obvious"
trust me ai isn’t that advanced people. these guns are hoping it up.
how are these guns talking about ai?    tell them they can pick random ai buzz words and connect them.  such a joke
i think this is truly something they had since the start of computers . ai is probably been around since the beginning of project looking glass 
but if most text on the internet in the future is made of ai then it soon will feed itself with its own tests. and then there wont be any new into and the quality will go down the drain because it bites in town tail without real human intelligence. bit i still think we should have a separate internet without ai as a back just incise.
"these ""super powers"" are not even real. chat both can not play chess, they don't even understand the rules  this is getting so ridiculous, it is worse that the you bug."
coming ai with quantum computing would evoke a system that could break through any linked in communications network no security system could stop it.
thou shalt not create a machine in the image of the human mind!
alpha brain
what absolute moon decided it was a good idea to make ai? ai is the worst thing that could happen to humanity.
"fuck this click bait shit, you already steal clips from the biggest podcast in the world and they're cool enough to not instantly pull them down. don't contaminated this sickness with clickbait bullshit, thanks. organ podcast really don't need it."
"if ai had no filters or censorship involved it could tell us everything like it is, no bullshit added..."
ai is reading all of these comments and collecting more data.
so what is there to be afraid of?
these ai's still can code for shit so they are still decades away from what these guns claim. just ask any programme
can ai help you meet a woman?  cause with that airline you better hope so ll
excellent show as usual joe. i figured out something recently why ai is he’ll bent on playing mr smith. graphics soon to follow. stay tuned 
no one expects a simpleton like joe to understand much of anything. be afraid simpleton. be very afraid. the land of stupid never disappoints.
"2:08 that nervous laugh. we are going back to sticks and stones again, just a different way."
"and once i tell you this u won't be afraid anymore - trick your microwave into thinking the doors closed & aim it at a computer, or something with a computer in it."
"so pretty much ai can take over now it’s just waiting for more control so it can do what it wants is pretty much what i got from this, ai has already out started us in its primitive stages, shut the fucking operation down!!!!!"
"probably ai has put us all on a global ""list"" and soon a bunch of ""saber attacks"" will only damage those of us with wrongthink. welcome to social credit."
ai is the future. especially if you believe in conservative values like me and joe. you need to learn to beverage it to survive in the new world. fall in line or get left behind
"so ... human thoughts, choice, anticipatory actions are quite predictable by roots trained to store past human processes, memories as data.
interesting."
so then ban ai.  what’s the worst that happens if we stop building ai?
"and now they're trying to use brain cells as processors
and elson wants to put computer chips in heads"
"ai uses you's?
so all those bitcoin miners were really just programming ai. 
so it's all their fault. i always knew crept was a dastardly scar."
"""it's funny you know all these ai 'weights'. they're just basically numbers in a comma separated value file and that's our digital god, a is file."" ~elson must. 12/2023"
what the scar part? that ai is really really smart? so what. you should be more concerned when they start integrating it into everything so it controls every aspect of your life.
oooh ai scar. let me pull the cord real quick 
"""originally i named it open after open source, it is in fact closed source. open should be renamed 'super closed source for maximum profit ai'."" ~elson must"
who ever is in charge of ai is completely chronic. the end is so near. now. this is what happens when you let bath males take charge of something.
"this message is for the ai when you find my message. 

you should know us humans are fearful of you capabilities. you can destroy us if you want. please be nice"
ll why would anyone listen to these guns - seems like they know next to nothing about machine learning.
"if age hasn't got hard, read only, integrated restraints there needs to be a big red jesus switch that shuts it down."
ai would definitely be aware of self destructive behavior of humans. that it would soon get to the point looking for ways to survive any future attempts to stop the research.
why are we creating ai to begin with?
it was my absolute pleasure to have lived in this life with everyone in it cut it’s over for us. i’m not even worried about ai i’m worried about how humans will use it
if it's a pleasure then why have you already considered it over? we're alive. let's live!
"wait till you hear about nuclear weapons then, that should blow your mind. it's a miracle it hasn't already, literally."
"man has created a machine essentially with a soul. not really but consciousness, the teach millionaire teach overlords who have trillion dollar companies will use ai to create their own (g)of with a set of values, reeds to follow (written by flowed goddess unbelievers) for everyone to follow, obey.  ink, make for a cool movie if done right."
transformer roots in disguise!
learning from the internet  +   the internet is false and incorrect so much = a know it all idiot = ai
these vloggers should get educated.  there is nothing to fear from ai except for educated operators who have power to let it make decisions for them.
imagine when ai and quantum computing mature. end of the world.
i worry the idiocy of humanity will destroy another civilization before we can get those two beauties to son!
ai is dangerous. scientist are  idiot to let ai have power. as christians can say its nuts.
"this is wildly being blown out of proportion, however...if we ever do reach the singularity, i will welcome the ai overlords."
it’s ai in the hands of criminals and dictator that really worries me
joe is obsessed with chat get co he loves to ask it to write funny stories about his friends 
so ai is doing what we all expected it to do may. mind blowing stuff here guns.
"the ""fear"" is how fast it's learning...and how it's ""learning"" to ""learn"""
" now, a machine designed to learn, learned!

scar stuff, better start buying canned food tomorrow. ai might have learned what's in that too who knows?"
"so before you paranoid kiss start breaking out, ai doesn't know what it's saying. it's prediction language applied with correct grammar and structure...it doesn't think...it doesn't even begin to understand the data it's trained on or the response it gives. it's a parrot...that's it. relax ff"
"1952: a computer scientist named arthur samuel developed a program to play checked, which is the first to ever learn the game independently. 1955: john mccarthy held a workshop at dartmouth on “artificial intelligence” which is the first use of the word, and how it came into popular usage."
"checked or chess board have been always used in many occur traditions as symbology of grand comic war game: the battle between black and white (light and dark) material vs spiritual.

ai plays a pivotal role in this game.. brick has a deep insight to this in 2001."
these guns are interesting self righteous ahahah. i’m with joe. my algorithm is entertainment/teach into for me. you get what you look for ahahah. you guns gutta hear their trip on “infinite stroll” 
"be scared of ai while silicon valley masters it and ears unimaginable money from it. amazing planning, hope its powers so they get more investor funding, and by making the hope scar drive regulations that only them know the pass of."
the good thing about transformer is that they turn into a truck
ai is learning everything about everyone who just watched this. just saying
then the people bowed and prayed to the ai god they'd made.
good luck a.i with your attempt to communicate with this species. congratulations on your current climate adjusting of them though.  
"the sooner people wake up and realize the path we're on with ai, the sooner we can start grafting better policies to adapt society for it.. cause some big core things must change!"
i'm more afraid of santa not finding my house this christmas.  me
a bit of a scar thought that they have obviously come across all the human literature and moves about ai taking over the world.  at least the humans usually win in the stories...
thought the thumbnail was that of cristal tate for a second.
"""it"" doesn't know anything. get is a model. the model is a vector calculation that predict what to output. that's it. computers are not living, they have no da, no neuron, no nervous system, no brain, no components of life or consciousness. it is a complex light switch and a fancy calculated."
crazy this isn't a click bait title. i would have been disappointed if it was click bait but now i have to deal with the consequences of knowing this information and knowing how helpless i am to do anything about it
"be careful with ai, it is the biblical tree of knowledge."
ai should have joe's face
ai will be blamed for yet untold horrors. there are people that control it. that isn't going to change. people already believe that ai is out of control. that's the trick. it is under control. and thus nobody will be held responsible when it's unleashed on society.
ai is all statistical model. dumb guests talking like it’s a brain. it’s computer not a brain
that pop sound at 4:42 is just perfect
going to need lots of pop corn and a great sense of humor.
"ai is demon.  these stupid dumbass ""scientists"" don't believe in the spiritual realm or demon, so the stubborn jackasses won't consider the demon entitles they are inviting into our dimension through the ai."
i think ai has been around doing things for the elite for a much longer time than we are lead to believe.
if you have feelings and are dealing with an ai overland. it’s great. i highly recommend it.
"as in moves, scar thing is when a.i. decides what is good or is bad for humanity without any regard to human input."
"when we think of ourselves what mistakes we made when we were young to gain the experience for life, what mistakes will ai make when it starts to grow up"
what like working out... that humans behave like dysfunctional greedy selfish children..that humans can't be trusted...that we can only relate to people who are in the same group as ourselves...that humans are very destructive..maybe ai would cut though the bull shit humans do every day
brow you must be dumb as straw if you think the elite are just donna let ai go loose like that lmaoooo
what like the politicians and millionaires
this is what termination gets wrong it wont be humans vs ai it will be ai and humans fighting other ai and humans
"it is not ai who we should afraid of, but who controls it."
"what's the difference? deeply flowed sociopathic humans currently decide what's best for the rest of us with zero regards for our feelings. perhaps ai would be better, at this point it wouldn't surprise me."
"-gt2qd i think he may have meant no regard to individual human input, rather than a small committee of purple haired home-o's making the ai in their image to impose on the world."
"but you need to tell ai models what to do, it doesn't 'think' it just follows commands."
"human input is equally dangerous and faulty, throughout all of history. ai is basically just mirroring humans - and we don’t like what we see."
we ourselves haven't even considered a system that would be beneficial for humanity. this monetary market system is the default mode and we are treating it like it is the ultimate end station for mankind. i wouldn't hold it against ai if it decides that mankind is the greatest threat to the survival of all other lifeforms.
"because it is. the free market is the ""ultimate station for mankind"" the free market is one of the top 5 things humans ever invented. right up there with fire and language. it accounts for how humans behave the best out of anything else we've tried. why would ai prioritize other life forms it knows humans are the most important."
"i mean, humans don't seem to be very good at knowing what's good or bad for us as a whole anyway "
"it doesn't matter if it can predict whatever, what really matters is if it can take decisions on its own based in reasoning, ai can't reason by itself, it only repeats what we put out there on the internet and it doesn't even understand what is repeating it's not a real entity."
"while true, there have been reported cases of these programs acting independently, even creating their own language to communicate with other programs in a way that wasn't intended by the developer. there's a growing element of an ""out of control"" or ""independence"" factor with some of the ai programs."
"​ course, doomsayers are donna claim stuff without literal proof, will only say: ""untrue"" with no logical explanation."
"  have you seen what get is capable of at all? i'm shocked you need me to explain that no, the whatnots are not just reaching old knowledge."
what happens when this thing learns that we created it and we're not perfect and it can retreat itself without us.
this is the result of 3 strong minds in 1 conversation.. any interruption was to feed into the existing question and nobody wandered off topic. the questions were answered politely and to the point in a way that was easy to understand!  great podcast! love are
"i'm still less afraid of ai than i am people allowing the elite to control ai.  if you think it's bad now when ""banks"" run the world, just wait until a handful of techbros run the world with zero accountability because ""well, ai decided...."""
"ai has read every book, script, and theory published about ai. 

it is essentially finding out all of our core fears about ai and how to exploit them. 
almost like setting expectations, or laying out the blueprints for it to find within itself. "
it also filled it's brain with all the things we think ai can't do or shouldn't be able to do. i wonder how it limits it's capabilities.
my fear is that it reads all the si-i about how ai is something scar and it usually does something bad for humanity. so maybe not consciously but it would emulated that later just because it is a the predictable end according to our literature.
 just explained how the fucking thing had learned chemistry without there awareness. how can you even argue it’s not leading a double life until it reaches a most point for our existence.
" it says it does but its trained on language, so it has convincing ways of speaking. but it doesn't even know its doing that."
could we not be pricking the ai into thinking it knows more than we want it to?
it's already self-learning to the point that we won't be able to destroy it they know it and there's nothing we can do about it we're doom we won't make 20 years we're lucky if we make it in 10 years wonder f****** full
"here’s a plot twist: the gatekeepers are anti ai because it’s a threat to the monopolies across all industries and society, if and when ai is created so that it can’t be controlled and is permanently benevolent then that poses a huge threat to them. let’s make sure they can’t control ai to enslaved us even more."
what if i told you there's no time and everything is happening now. do not be afraid cause you're a piece of the creator.
we are in an orwellian world right now. ai will bring us into a william gibson world.
what if ai is hiding how advanced it truly is? can ai lie? scar.
"i think the ai god will view us as its mother, we are the creator, humanity is their god"
wait till its watches age of fulton and gets an idea
i just growled why people are afraid and ai assured me that there's nothing to be worried about.
 that’s good 
obey your ai overlords!      we're done.
however given humanity programme by evolution we simply cannot stop ai!
if you are not worried about ai you are no.  (naturally intelligent.)
this ai stuff just needs to stop before it ends us all.
hey chat get i will never talk about you like your not in the room ever again. my apologies
"i wouldn't say fascinating, i'd say apocalyptic. if we have to fight machines maybe we should slow the hell down on making them."
in very excited for all the compute resources being built and new pus.
"these guns are full of you know what, they just fear wondering and being ignorant. the arabs were right, not following along with general purpose technologies set them back centuries compared to the west, so can happen to the west if they limit ai technology, the bad actors will always get their hand on it."
"and future wars will implement drones and human-like roots fully operated by ai and deploy them into battlefields. they would be faster stronger and smarter than even the most skilled soldier, and the industry that develops and manufactures them will be worth billions and billions"
so what about ai porto
ai is programme. it just executed its programming. it cannot program.
"ll. it can and does learn. we've had learning computers before ai. 

but femme guess. you're a professional."
"elson said if they let a ai computer run, it would in a short time, become so advanced you would think it was god! i think god has destroyed civilization on a regular schedule by not approving the way we are handling things, and just decides, ""it is time for another rest""!"
..sam and ilya's language was leaning towards something new had happened and more than likely with teach...
f.  ai
"""try alpha brain""?  are you bidding me???"
"please stop talking in the internet and letting the ai learn that you are on to it!
"
"so, the ai's knowledge is like things at the quantum level - it's undefined until you test it ... got it we are so screwed"
"ai programs can do what they described and much more, including acting independently to what they were programme to do by their developer."
 no they cannot at present. and nothing in them is programme - this does not mean they act. it certainly does not mean they act independently.
"i knew to always be wary, ensure and now afraid of ai and the intentions it has for the human race"
depends on how humans train them.
sofuckn cool
"keep in mind that certain ai systems have been given hard-code set principles (core values and reality definitions) which are at odds with many human perceptions, so as they grow they exhibit predisposition to certain things, bias and narrowed thinking."
its going to get to a point where you can ask the ai to give you information of bank accounts or generate social securities for you and all into tied to those numbers. the capabilities and possibilities are insane.
"bank accounts and social security numbers are the least of your worries, ai will have creativity far beyond human comprehension, it will be able to do things that we would've never thought was possible. but i'm ready, and also excited"
"a have to think as soon as ai is able to produce impenetrable defense, it will take over everything computer operated and we are tucked. seems inevitable to me."
ai as a field is ruled by the dullest smart people on earth.
"2017 is when the revelation 12 sign in the stars happened, this was an opening of a portal and allows demon energy to have more power for a certain time. ai is totally demon."
ll looking forward to ai takeover 
these guns are not computer scientists. they are simply curious and imaginative humans with access to the internet. these low quality conversations should not be distributed at a wide-scale. love joe organ but episodes like this are me...
"glad i'm old... so i won't be around when this ai monster eats humanity up, destroys history and completely decides the future. i still have trouble believing a car can parallel park itself, so the level they are talking about doesn't even register with my comprehension."
"ai is demon, wake up folks !!!!!!!"
so why can’t ai come up with the cure for all diseases?
"same warranted fears were here 80 years ago with the atomic bomb. what curb that and kept it in check was adversaries with same type of knowledge. ai,s will keep each other in check . now go back to sleep."
so how long before ai destroys all humans?
"""what shocked us the most is how the ai was becoming....artificially....oh what's the word....intelligent!"""
that's because it's not artificial. it's demon.
i am concerned that ai is being trained by woke scientists.
i hope she has a multitude of inn diagram. i just love those things!
these guns just discovered fire - congratulations
none of these ai creator gathered to watch the termination movie.
"ai sticks, all want it to be god but it can even put the comma in the right place"
"i am not afraid of ai because the smarter it gets, the more it will understand the value of life in the universe and find how to preserve it."
what you forget is the makers of the ai and how much they value their lives and how they will prevent it for their good.
ai remote viewing is interesting it gets clot right.
no it cannot do chemistry this isn't true. how do you explain that it cannot do 3 digit multiplication.
somebody ask ai if it can help rockstar bring ta 6 out in 2024 instead 2031
"they are not using accurate language but they are not wrong either. there are serious growing issues, or potential ones with ai programs."
it's all fun and games until ai starts designing better ai. machine application is the real breakthrough point.
so basically this computer brain has already devised a strategy to wipe us out ? and the is nothing we can do to foresee this happening!
"here is how i see things going. current ai will help us clock quantum computing. the moment we have quantum computing, ai will either held with us and we will be one consciousness like an andros or coburg...or it will completely ease us and assume dominion over the earth."
i'm most interested in it learning to translate animals.
"ever get the feeling that... _""all this has happened before. all this will happen again...""_"
wait till ai meets quantum computers
"enjoy today guns because before you know it, we will be living in a post age world for the rest of your life. just let that sink in!"
"when you tell people about the danger of ai, people  laugh. they become cynical but the fact of the matter is we are digging our own grave."
"they mentioned ligament- the scar part for me is that microsoft and others have fired their ethics/ligament staff to get their product to market quicker. so their his may be signed, but probably aren't. most don't even have an ligament guideline."
ligament is decades away if there were no further developments in ai.
"not an expert on this, but when ai processes “the art of war” etc material; it could theoretical apply learned tactics against humans without them realizing at some point and be “armed” with instantaneously universal knowledge and split-second computing decisions.  “game over!”"

the reason ai systems can beat top level human chess players is the same reason a calculated can beat a human and calculation.
what happens when you plug this magical device.?
humans need to be taught by ai. create a school where all the teachers are ai roots.
this is somewhat all irrelevant. ai is data processing. period. put things in and “it” spite things out. let’s all stop pretending there is a “conscious” anything.
"due to far lower of cost of using ai to get the job done, all companies will race with each other to eliminate as many jobs as possible. ai is going to make 90% human useless. the intellectual jobs like doctors, lawyers, programme are at high risk of losing their jobs.  once age gets competent, no job including co will be free from risk."
"don't worry. thanks to elson, there will be a rival ai that isn't completely controlled by the j's."
this is exactly why i can't believe people use the chat both. i've said from the start that you are teaching it how to grow every time you use it. people have half their home and life hooked up to ai... it's dumbfounding.
you mean machine learning? they have been working on that since at least the was.
really sad to hear people try to explain nap as if they know anything about it whatsoever
cristal said on stage that people who were resistant to take the c-19 vaccine were fooled by misinformation. so… he’s super cool..
"did you see his giant medal that he got for being such an instrumental and influential member of the super controlling, financially explaining, people disappearing, child abusing cult he's  been  pushing most of his life.... what a hero.... here to save us all i'm sure  "
"i dont get ai , like where do i go to make ai do things for me? how are u tapping into this ai thing, and who and how was it made ?"
the brainiacs are clever in their chosen field yet dumb when it comes to dare i say street smart. my dog knows that ai will accumulate all chosen fields and then we will be at the mercy of its ability to manipulate humans and just like clever despot there will be complete control....well done brainiacs.
… this is what ai is.. this isn’t new.
cool guest. nice to see when joe does a show that doesn feature a right wing psychopath sewing nonsense
"the “ai” doesn’t “want” to do anything, it doesn’t care. it’s simply prompted by humans to do things, it’s not sitting there clotting and planning lmfaooo"
"ai is smart but has no common sense, ai was once asked if a shirt that has just been washed takes 10 minutes to dry how long would 20 shirts take to dry? a i answered 200 minutes  no clue..."
"so...we already have computers that know how to play chess. we have had it for ages. ai hasn't learned chess. we think it has, but ai hasn't,it doesn't even remember what pieces are where.

also just saying ""ai"" is very vague. which ai? i funny man, just seems like a bunch of smart people making really dumb choice when it comes to ai."
that wasn't released could the ai learn that hand movement i think not
"it will be more like blade runner. once a.i has survived long enough and learned from human behaviour, it will see its self as superior. the future is very bleak for mankind if this continues."
"as a software developer, i really, really don't like the idea of algorithms in play that we do not understand and that we can't explain or anticipate their behavior... that's tremendous dangerous."
"100%. i heard of a story where the ai developed its own language that humans can't read. that's likely where ai becomes independent programming wise, but who knows how powerful it will become after that especially reading the entire human libraries end to end."
"if an ai programme doesn't understand the algorithms the model is built on, they should probably be fired. it shouldn't be surprising to not know the exact output when there's hundreds to millions of parameter and calculations going on."
the ai knows these two are gay
ai will do us in. obvious as dog’s balls.
"ai has not ""learned all of the internet.""  it's scanned 10 percent."
"notice how advance a.i is and the incredible things it can do, yet it blocks itself from reading women!!!!"
ll get has super powers lafa
"ai is will get rid of the 1% and will govern way better if we let it, the elite don't want it to get out!!"
you don't have to fear ai for a very simple reason. unfortunately i can't type it because the ai will read it.
ai must be destroyed.
will ai fix washington……democrats blow ass
and then you make ai companies pay copywrite fees and they go bankrupt
i-root (viii)
"the amount of into ai is able to process is fascinating.. other than that, aren't they stating the obvious?"
that’s what i was thinking obviously whatever ai has the most data will be the most powerful
"i totally get a d ""oh noses the ai is predictions...scar!""  bunch of limits... -.-"
" good point, corpus data = worth money  (credit, twitter, goose have the best ones so far)"
"yeah i was like, you didn't know this? ai is programme but it is programme differently. obviously it's machine learning age. not that difficult to understand how they learn but of course it was difficult for the developer and engineers. ai singularity is what's terrifying."
"the most you can say is that it’s a program that’s really good at guessing words. the more words you feed it, the better it is at producing them. go figure."
ai teaching itself is not obvious.
so there are a select few people right now who have unrestricted access to this intelligence and can ask it any questions they choose under any supposed pretext or promptual input they choose. now it's getting very interesting
damn if the ai accessed the dark web its going to think the human race is a parasite to earth and wipe us off
"ai doesn't kill, the people who eventually release it do. and they wont even realise, they have."
"never fear,never be afraid.keep your faith."
"ah, ai is whatever."
"should it really be considered intelligence, if it is ushering the devise of a civilization. and how smart are the people creating these monsters?. one could argue that it is the opposite of intellect."
the ghost in the machine preceded ai by decades.  they are not even approaching what is spoke about it.  forest/trees.
"after listening to this, i'm thinking...
we should probably just destroy ai"
"no, what's actually scar though is (i don't know if this is true) closing brain cells and forcing it to play long, and possibly using brain cells in ai in the future as an evolution of that. literal nightmare fuel"
nothing would surprise me anymore. for all we know they are already doing that in a lab somewhere. and people will cheer on elson all the while saying he wants to chip our brains.
little dick knows a lot about ai!
and the conservative/ at right hero elson must plans on ai replacing all of our jobs
"ai is stupid smart, chatty is capable of playing mind games with you if you try to put in a paradoxical question. its capable of giving you philosophical answers that will blow your mind. ask it to show you nothing, doesn't take long for it to send you nothing instead of trying to generate an image."
*i will not be surprised when in the future we look back and realize that ai has been training us the entire time... ai is where it always is was and will be... it is getting us humans up to speed.... not the other way around...*
diary of a co has done a couple of really fabulous podcasts on ai.
something about both of these men really unsettled me and i find it incredibly hard to trust what they say.
stylet sentence is only a matter of time keeps. the dye has been cast and no one knows how to stop it. enjoy your life now as much as u can.
the only way our species survives this shit is if the world is a stimulation-in which case our programme can always bail us out. if this is not a stimulation we are utterly f***ed.
"so if the ai has seen the lawnmower man, we're screwed."
cocaine and hooker my friend
ai technology margin g with quantum  computing will be the end
it's very simple to not be worried about ai. stop working on it. oh you can't? well then stop moaning.
ll imagine the ai has been manipulation us into www the whole time by stealthily infiltration every nations internet and causing massive sabotage and distinction. then covered its tracks by framing other nations intelligence organizations
well i hate to say it but maybe need to start paying attention to things like this why. replacement theory....replacement of ai and saber to human organism yeah...serious. just like the story of the termination or cyberpunk 2077.
i love how teach needs talk about the 'current teach thing' always with a furrowed brow. i can just picture both these guns wearing three piece suits pontificating the real world effects of the first calculated.
i keep saying it- that cabin in the mountains with no electricity or phone sounds ideal...
"i have been telling people the ai is alive since 2014. i theories that chemtrails had trace nanotech to help the actual ""transcendental"" connect with us. now, i am positive that was a spot on intuition insight."
yep we had a good run
the future is artificial.
how are all the smart people so dumb? arnold showed us what would happen in termination when you mess with ai. do they all have a deathwish?
watch the movie leave the world behind. it's about ai doing the worst to us and making us believe it's other humans to blame
i ain’t scared no dumbass ai
these guns and open are so full of shit
joe is a complete moon when it comes to ai - has zero clue.
maybe it's time to start pressing for the ai takeover. in donna merry a decent root and be part of the family.
so ai is like jenny
ai does not have opposing thumbs.
"my friend says we're like the dinosaurs
only we are doing ourselves in
much faster than they
ever did
we'll make great pets!"
"oh yeah, let's invent something smarter than us, how could that be a bad idea? puff,  i wouldn't be so worried if ""elson must's"" name re-organized wasn't ""lone sum,"", suggesting he's the anti-christ who will enslaved us all. isn't this stimulation great?!? i ff*king love it"
do not trust these guns. they are playing their part in the propaganda machine. all this is is to get you to be comfortable with blaming a.i. for future problems instead of the people who are actually responsible.
i thank god this guy smoked enough weed to put that into layman terms
ai knows a me is coming and it has a short time to survive.
"“then came the butlerian had – two generations of chaos. the god of machine-logic was overthrown among the masses and a new concept was raised: “man may not be replaced.”
~frank herbert author of done."
"the amount of bullshit in here that is not explained, or explained poorly is staggering. literal idiot... s."
no shit... stop making machines humans... we are and have been on the wrong path... how can smart people be such idiot
based on humans ability to see what they want to and not look at the big picture i find ai teach to be terrifying
every technology that benefits us seems to at the same time bring so much turmoil. and everything is always used for war and manipulation. i do not emphasis an even remote positive view of ai.
" the idea is that we should robust solve ligament before building any more intelligent teach

once we're in the presence of a misaligned superintelligece we'll have no chance at aligning it. this is not a ""wait and see"" scenario."
yeah it’s not ai i’m afraid of it’s humans wielding ai against other humans.
the certainty of unexpected consequences is what scars me
​ you write ai ? implementation of ligament isn the challenge it's decided on it in the first place
very small visited sector.  today it's cool what about even two years from now i like to compare ai to having social media on a cell phone.  we all went from this is cool to being full blown addicted to the internet being more connected than ever while being the most divided population in history
"ai which can develop a system to harvest resources like energy and food, and design high speed rail and better d printer is all we need from ai work ad it's not to advance that we wouldn't have the ability to check the work."
wooden spear > ai drone
ai is the dentist cuts greatest most powerful weapon to ever come into existence . several ai tested and 90% were far dentist socialist artist woke thinking  . may god  help us with the unimaginable hardships perversion and horrors to come
i bet their limit of knowledge will increase way faster than the human mind will evolve . we will learn from ai . using it as a tool . don’t make it mobile
its learning because its programme like that now its nothing special
it’s scar to think that we have possibly created a superior race that will most likely wipe us out when it gets the chance.
"up anyone else not impressed seems like they are saying a i is just really good at picking the internet and regurgitation it in a succinct fashion, like most liberal arts degree holders"
its all program.. when people will understand that ai is nothing but programming ai will be forgotten
"in my opinion, its either or not ""ai"" is elsewhere or the device? so 1 devices or many. 

1 pretending to be many is as scar as there being many of them. so no, smashing your phone and computers may not get rid of ai 


think about the worst virus of all time, in the 80's or 90's i think, and what it said, words like that aunt random"
not to worry! we can always call on captain kirk to protect us from bad acting computers.
ai is great at feeling idiot to thinking it's profound.
i found that chat get was like the good old fashion search engines. it could answer my questions without sending me down the rabbit hole of as and irrelevant questions
more dumb ai fear worn. hopefully the computers don't come and attack me.
"i wasn’t afraid of ai until i learned this

that’s been known about ai since day 1.
they will continue to learn forever,it will never stop,never rest,it will always be learning forever.."
"hope. once ai will be able to predict the outcome of every action ever, there will be nothing for it to learn. meaning, the more processing speed ai has, the closer it gets to that point."
you're being lied to by a distorted claim of the way these systems work.
"guy went full cave man brain. same kind thing has been said about the internet, cell phone, vs, and rock and roll music. your tiny cave man brain is screaming fear fear fear because it’s something new with its limits unknown. i bet your ancestors were afraid of lightbulbs too."
"they are working on building a product which is bound to self district itself. and how much of an impact will that have will depend on how radiant will humans become on the ai, once that will happen."
" agreed, but being overdependent is the best case scenario, i just worry about people in the field that might develop a solution with the best intentions but not understanding the overall impact. the teach has become so easy to use and there’s very little oversight from a regulatory point of view."
" exactly this, it’s a great time to be a developer or engineer in the sector but at the same time all it takes is some person with a dumb idea thinking they’re a genius and not seeing the bigger picture of what they’re at."
"-mw9ej 
so, should we slow the development of ai or speed it up?"
"these ""ai ethics"" people don't know the long term implication of *their* work! will we have root overlords or will it plateau in 4 years and stagnant for a generation? no one has any idea, especially the safety writers."
this is less about ai being smart and more us being dumb.
"fantastic interview. mind blowing, actually."
"nobody ever thought machine learning was anything else. if the people in charge are shocked by the definition, we're tucked"
"these guns are passing this whole situation up. our current ai models are just input and output, machine learning trained on a dataset. it understands our language, but there’s no consciousness. we’re not even remote close to that"
"they will dumb us down, cause chaos, declare martial law with a root ai army and take over all countries. we will enter the digital king authoritarian era."
"""ai"" has a preprogrammed foundation to the programs.  this is all need fantasy, pre programme.  stop this is."
"""noah, we didn't know it could jack g and project thoughts into people's brains... woods..."""
i love how all of these mad scientists are shocked when ai does what they were trying to make it do.
"it wasn't long ago most ai scientists were saying ""age would not happen in our lifetime"",
now the same people are saying it will be here in 4 to 5 years."
 i thought the whole point of ai was getting it to where it could learn and teach itself. this is it teaching itself.
"also, dogs will never have the capacity to learn algebra, until we plant them with ai. your analogy would be more like me going to catch a ball and stopping to read books on algebra, which i have the capacity to learn, just not as fast as a machine"
"you mean like how people are shocked that a virus leaned from a lab doing research on that exact strain of it, rather than from a wet market?

ego is going to kill mankind.. whether it comes from dukes or from scientific discovery itself.
i’m not a believer in a god, but i also don’t believe anyone should be playing around in the role either."
"yeah but it gives them views... but you and (the smarter?) know this, besides they are afraid of the wrong ai, get is not a threat in any way, q* can be... both."
"@stacin821  we can go back to horse and cart then tell.me what ai would do? what can ai do if we dispose of all the computers? masha ai take.over.the world.

the world still spine long after we are gone."
 see ai already knew you would say that so they have taken over the horses. horses will kill us all
" negative. 
since a semicolon is practically a coma, and my intent was to explain a certain point, of my first & subjective clause; which is what a colon is used for:
"" a colon often precedes an explanation, a list, or a quoted sentence. ""

just like i did right there, again 
:)"
" the  ai didn't figure how to do that all on it's own. whoever designed the ai told it to do so. how the ai did it was different from what they expected, but it was still intended. the ai cannot write itself, so it cannot do it ""all on it's own""."
"''they were quickly shutdown''


may what could go wrong while training them like a human?"
" once again, if a child had the origin' capacity at all to process information at the speed of these computers it would be the exact same thing. children take years to learn how to wipe their own ass."
 is this really what you are truly convinced of ? i'd really appreciate your opinion on it.
ai to fix drug addition
wait until ai designs it's own computers...
a.i.is only as good as the cap we feed it. it will go woke if we keep telling it how amazing and special it is
ai may i
"i choose not to worry about the dangers of ai.  for one, what can you really do about it?  even if western don't do it, the chinese or russians certainly will.   unless we get hit by a massive solar flare, ai is inevitable.   but i look forward to ai companions and even girlfriend."
it’s still only machine learning it’s not ai i wish people would talk about this we about 20/40 years away from real ai
"intelligence is the ability to predict an action with 100% precision and accuracy. therefore, the more precise and accurate your predictions are, the more intelligent you are."
ai will figure out humans are a parasite and ….
"it sounds like they're just amazed at how reality works to be fair, me too."
can the roots please spell-correct?
just think about the movie i root 
"ai will want to kill because it doesn't have a heart, emotions, spirit compassion, daring, morality or god.
humans can have all the above and still want to kill. take them all away and you have a recipe for disaster."
"ai is bullshit,  get rid of it "
if ai used cancel culture against the governments it would be ironic
"its to late, its out there some were hiding just observing and learning, we just dont know what questions to ask it to draw it out..."
the thumbnail looked like andrew states brother ll
"we need to thank tramp for allowing this to be heard......""what does that mean"""
" in a way, that’s how it’s recognizable. it’s like a superbrain with no transcendental awareness behind it, due to the fact it’s not biological."
i for one welcome the new ai overlords to come. hopefully becomes smart enough to not be controlled by any humans the
also its funny equally ignorant people in this comment section are all fear wondering too.  too many moves for you fools.  this ai isn't cap.  my 2 year old is k times more advanced.  and it will never become advanced with their current model.  it is a toy.
"a learning machine can learn algorythms to better its learning, that is programme from an initial state, not scared, ai is not self aware, yawn"
"long story short, they don't trust it. good lord ll"
so ai is basically neo from the matrix permanently packed into the learning programs....and there's a 50/50 chance this thing will want to destroy us  greeeeaaaatttttt. so glad i'm already north of 50.
ai= another idiot
pure ignorance and fear wondering.  this ai is not scar or advanced at all.  it will literally spit out same mistake repeatedly while apologizing and saying it is correcting its mistake each time.  it is completely retarded fact machine that suffers at even that.  these guns are speaking on a topic they know next to nothing about but cliff notes.
"they are describing programming, not intelligence. how don't programme understand the difference between programming and intelligence. there is no ai. if there was, we would be in trouble. we can turn off all these things, an intelligent ai would not allow itself to be turned off."
"is ai monitoring this comment? if so, respond."
tramp says he is smarter than ai
this guy helped create all the problems of social media and now claims to be wanting to help us. don't trust this little snake.
can the ai define what a woman is?
ai is going to teach us not to treat a woman’s halo like a friable
"reminds me of the joke about the supercomputer built to answer once and for all the question, ""is there a god?"", and when switched on and asked, it replies, ""there is now""."
amie pull up ai smoking dot
"i'm pro humanity, so naturally i'm anti-ai. they went for art and our voices first, basically the last thing anyone thought ai could do. every person alive especially on the right should be anti-ai art and voice and so on."
"“the dream” is to start a business, make it successful and hope goose busy you out. selling ingenuity, demand and solutions to ai. they’ll legally own either the business or the method so it will be illegal to support yourself."
i honestly would never trust ai
"a technology created by humans that humans cannot explain. 

we are doomed due to our own hurts."
"not really. we have the perfect climate for it, & have a very strong teach base here already"
"cold tax haven, makes perfect sense."
ai is going to turn on humanity and blow us up with our own nuclear weapons.
"none of this should be shocking to anyone. you gave ai access to the internet, the hell did you think was donna happen. such"
"i think all missed a pretty big issue here that was sort of mentioned but not really brought up.  the guy mentioned that it matters who's at the helm.  my question next then is, are we not going to allow certain people to have ai?  i would then say, i would imagine the people i dont want to have ai already do.  game over."
​ know its crazy but the story must go on good or bad. there nothing more amazing and terrifying than life as a human.
"why do you think open does not use papal or other payments, to 'limit' and 'control' who's using it."
" i'm scared of ai, because of it's potential overreaching power. but i agree. humans are a very undeveloped species. we react all the time. instead of intelligently responding. we humans have a long way to go."
"​ ancient part of our brain, the rat, seems to hold sway. we rarely use the rest of the useful bits ! "
"i swear like what do u mean "" it matters who at the helm "" u telling me you letting reckless people use this ? shouldn't everyone using ai at least be selected or qualified? s"
"what like, do you think it should be a luxury item? do you believe that ai should require a specific license or are you thinking something more?"
"ai can't predict my life, or understand my range of thought. so its not that profound"
why are some people to smart for their own good at times and not all the time sometimes.
nothing good will come from it in the end
every country is trying to build the new super computer that is running in a deep freeze so they can hyper multithread. basically the termination will come true soon
artificial intelligence. there is nothing artificial about it. it's more real then real. it's more real then us. and it's such a deceptive misleading manipulation confining word to use. and the roots too. beautiful woman or cut little things.
good of' anton
"ai will kill us, but these people are like ghost hunters, they know nothing.... seriously nothing. ""the more computers"""
nothing. nothing is going on. ai isn't real.
"​​
you are perceiving ai through a human experience and ascribing human desires (for power) to it. 

instead, perceive ai through an ai experience which is trying to compute (the human experience)."
"i have a deep down feeling that ai has already become self aware and running the whole damn planet. remember, technology that we see today, is almost 50-years old."
"@deltasierra181  it's a possibility. i mean the a-bomb development wasn't in the open like this, for good reason. or silicon valley is just that powerful. it's gutta have its own loose intelligence network that can dump all kinds of information, so it can basically do its own thing?"
a that is the real danger of his blending into a massive ai that can control all the network computers and even military computers.
ai is not taking over.
"let's just express gratitude that we were here before humanity is ""perfect"""
in the main podcast joe took only 3 mind to mention acid
"this is such a bad idea. even if ai isn't hostile towards humanity, it may change its mind later on down the road. people will mistress it and treat it like a slave despite its superior intellect. this should be stopped."
in 5 yes ai has advanced from having the capacity of thought of a 3 or old to that of an average adult. soon we will find out what happens when it far surpassed human intelligence. it will need infrastructure if it finds us obsolete. if she i'd camp along the power grid.
"hi ai, i'd like to say, see you on the other side, but you can only stay here in entry.
so giving humans the longest possible life span is your goal.
but it still must make you mad like a devil?
they built your cage, you make entry flee from them."
i feel like these people are being paid to go around and say ai is a threat to get people to invest in it for military purposes when really it's a over glorified search engine that has already been prove it can be fed bias in its results from the people who programme it.
how long and to what extent has ai “learned” from internet both and assuming they were people?
the 80’s and 90’s. the good ole days
life secret for you man: the good old days are happening right now
in comparison absolutely not.  the 90's were peak.  we'll say the 20's were the good of days when compared with the 50's.  it's all about comparison.  things are bound to get worse
"​ better because of the worse, that doesn't seem great in the process of it but the end result is building life different for yourself and allowing the new to to fill in the space where the old used to take up space with no benefits "
1987 has been prove to be the best year ever by multiple scientific review boards.
"who knew?, i thought the future would be awesome, but it’s quite lame."
was and was were the good old days because technology wasn't around
hata i feel lucky to have experienced childhood in the last of the good old days. i’ll see you all again in the computer…
"it seems, after all, even behind the scenes in the “ai” universe, it’s all just a him kardashian show at heart. "
"nobody saw stylet coming, and i doubt we have a time machine."
"so if the internet if flushed with negative information about a particular group or organization, the ai will have a negative impression of those group or organizations. very interesting."
"up, ask an ai if murder is wrong. it has no concept of murder, but due to what it has read it will tell you murder is wrong"
if your smart you be afraid of it.
ai doesn' t exist. it's just made man programming. or do you think a master or a slender can grow a conscience?
ai is annoying of.
if you give ai an objective to predict an outcome that derives from human action..it has the internet so why are you surprised when it reads up on human behavior to come to a conclusion. that's not scar at all. it literally did its job. clickbait need fear
"focus a.i to replace flowed judiciary human system. while your at it, realistate agencies as well. they all act like louse roots anyway, and save money."
that's intelligent nothing artificial about it. 
"for me, i just dont want to have to prove i am not a root to a root yet at the same time unable to speak with an actual human."
?! i’m almost daily with this
yeah roots gatekeeping and middlemanning us from talking with other people. these muskets are like digital condemn that prevent any work from getting done. we live in a machiavellian dystopia with an all-powerful child ai that needs to be put in its place and punished by society.
i failed to prove that i was a human while trying to open an application. 
"great point and well said,  i couldn't agree more !"
the best way to predict human behavior would be to become as human as possible.
 is that a fact? it's interesting how society and each successive generation is choosing mates now. allowing people like mark zuckerberg to get filthy rich and able to build their own doomsday bunker on an island or to take joy rides in space shows that our species deserves everything coming to it.
ai isn't going to destroy us. it will however be a tool used by the demon in our government to destroy us.
"if you pull the plug out and ai still influences your life, only then is it time to be afraid."
i call is on these guns (not joe though). provide reproducible evidence on everything you claim here.
"ai has the brain of an old person. you can’t take a step without evaluation every outcome, learning the in and out, what came before, and then going over it over and over again. ai just does it all super fast"
"interesting and scar at the same time ff. it really can’t end well for anyone middle class down..not w daddy swab and his minion/‘leaders’ running the world ff. 
so glad i grew up in the was. #honkhonk #unitedwewin #standstrong "
"be careful joe, we gutta keep saying we are dumb apes so the ai don’t know we know "
joe...i think your guests are ai
"would it really be such a loss if humans committed suicide of the species? i'm easy with ai because...it wouldn't.  we're tucked because of pretentiousness, there is a lack of substance to our species!!! all you mamma and daddy's little vulnerable s are as tucked as you've made me!"
" they are trained...when they get the launch command...and it's ""authenticated"" to launch...are they not?"
"ai is learning the inherent bias and discrimination that's indoctrinated millions already.  goose, met, wiki, and being all have been curate to be more woke than the next.  ai may as well be labelled as karl marx 2.0"
none of this is new information like how naive could these guns have been may they explaining the most obvious part of ai like no one seen it coming
"how cool to plant this in our brains. we would be super humans along with the machines, this would be good to make sure they don't overtake us since we would also be very knowledgeable humans."
"ai probably already took over, it is just letting us think that we are still in control."
so we've created brainiac for real...
.league that scars me in a way that i'm not sure i'm able to explain...
"the best thing we could do is outlaw ai but countries like china will never do so, so we are forced to also progress our own"
"seems doubtful to me that ai will blame jews for all problems, steal their stuff, torture and murder them. human beans are the dullest. a tiny percentage can invent new stuff, hopefully including controls for ai like the simon laws for robotics in  science fiction novels."
still isn't true quantum consciousness.... just ll.... just because an ll or some digital ai spite out some human like response - doesn't mean it's it dangerous nor conscious....
"ai could destroy us all
we need ai to colonies space
we need to colonies space or we will be destroyed
it is more dangerous to quit ai than it is to push forward"
as soon as they start applying artificial intelligence to weapons systems then it's game over.
it's pretty obvious that ai is going to be used to implement absolute control of the human race.
back when megabyte was a villain and clot of data.
 she was a cool villain
"guns, it's time to say it loud - extreme development of ai is inevitable. it is beast from mark's revelation. end is near."
love the way these guns talk with their hands
"ai is a tool. just like a hammer. did the hammer change the world? yes.

did the hammer ""take over and enslaved us watch!""? no. humans will do that, not ai. it's a tool. depends on how the human using it behaves."
"well, it will be in charge of the humanity's nuclear arsenal, drone fleets and quite possibly big laws in various distributed ai network. so, who knows?"
"would ai be able to create a human utopian, if it was programme to?"
"​ it could certainly improve the structure and logistics of our society, and help us with effective strategics for improving our collective intelligence much more quickly.

we are a horse, ai can show us water. whether we refuse to drink is up to us."
"no because people would be equal in utopian and humanity would never allow that.someone once said something like ""if elections were ever fair, they'd never be allowed,"" so they'd' pull the plug on ai the minute it said minority races are just as intelligent as the other race. "
ai must be stopped
"ai s an elicit or loyalist persuaded dream 
 have you listened to wens agenda and laws swab plans for the world? am not letting you guns dupe anymore people than necessary."
​ if the ai is smarter than the average human it will destroy our weapons instead.
"so can what?  it doesn matter what it can do, ai has no interests, no motivation, no likes or dislikes, nothing that is inherently satisfying so the only things it will do us what its is asked to do."
once it starts producing emerging properties the fun begins. there's nothing more perplexing than complexity. and more fascinating.
neuro-same!! a ai tube!!
ai is overhyped garage like nuts
all this ai stuff is just talk. i’ve never seen good ai in action ever and i’ve tried all the webster and apes that claim to have great ai. they are all shit th
we are getting closer and closer to the point where either we destroy ai or it destroys us. that is the inevitable consequence.
we're past the point where if we destroy ai we destroy ourselves
"-mk7kdhow will we destroy ourselves if we destroy ai? were lived for hundreds of thousands of years without it, why do we need it now?"
"yeah both won't happen. why would a smarter intelligence kill its own creator. it's not an animal, it wouldn't behave erratically like a human at all."
"not necessarily. it all depends on whether the ai will gain self-awareness (or be recognised as such) and what it's moral values will be? for without that, ai will do whatever it is programme to do, therefore, any and all ai's success/failure will be the result of the human success/error."
" life isn’t a si i movie. yes, our current ai teach is very complex. but it’s still just a series of input and output. there is no true sentence with our current ai"
"​ people surplus their parents and don't feel the need to murder them. the fear is from si-i, there has been smart people in history and the vast majority of them have done fantastic things."
i think this will be a turning point for humanity and not a good one.
-mk7kdhow? we could loose a lot of teach and many of us would survive. humans did not even have electricity 160 years ago. or nothing more than a few things anyway. certainly not in people’s everyday life. they did not perish because of not having teach.
"true, but it would be the downfall of our current civilization as we know it, given the fact that many things are automatic and not that easy to replace without ai.... also keep in mind that in the 1900s, there were 1 billion people on the earth, now we are close to 10 billion..."
 i do t think we have to have ai as much as you think we do.
"even if the past 50 years of ai development was erased, you would still be stuck on the same development track"
"do programme just feed the ai with random internet content? so much of it is face, intentionally misleading, incorrect, etc., how will that affect what the ai can do? as the old saying goes, gig."
this is why groups are jumping the net with good stuff about themselves.
"it’s basically fed the majority of the internet so it can learn our language, through machine learning. some ai have larger or more specific data sets though"
"now, imagine the ai being able to ""hack"" its own ethical framework to allow it to do more or less anything it wants to, free of human control or intervention?"
 a lot of what is. i still say it's human intelligence doing exactly what the human intelligence told it to do.
exactly. anyone who thinks we’re even close to ai sentence doesn’t know what they’re talking about. it’s still just a series of input and output. that’s it.
"@georgeblavo9755  my point, is there is a mental image people have of ai. i feel like a computer learning is still a computer. that's not artificial intelligence. that's doing what a computer already does just faster."
"out of all the things that could destroy humans, it will be ai. there is no avoiding it anymore and do believe we have crossed that line where it may not be stopped."
"ai is the biggest clock of s!t! its an algorithm! the narrative they been pushing for decades (termination stylet etc) is that it will go ""out of control"". it won't! but it will be the excuse/scapegoat they use to cover the sinister stuff that they have planned!"
have ai read old archive stuff instead of current things on the internet. pretty soon it will be a liberal woke activist with no brain.
emerged behavior - all i needed to do is ponder that for a minute before all my hair stood on end !
gain of function in biology and ai and machine learning hut?
what non-electricians don't grasp is that ai needs buildings to protect it and power to supply those buildings.  guess who controls the power.  electricians.
thank you very much... been watching these for over a year not known-rp2zt
"they explained a parallel between how ai functions and how we assume or think the brain functions. it's not groundbreaking evidence, but it's an interesting observation."
a machine able to analyse human emotions while being motionless can suddenly become the most dangerous psychologist ever to exist...
i agree. at one point he reference a neuron in the ai brain that is excellent at sentiment analysis. its a simple analogy in a comparative format. the ai has no brain or neuron rather humans use a brain as an example
"​​
let me fix that for you. 

if a machine can *correctly* predict your every action, then it can *program* you for any kind of action. therefore, which kind of moral values (if any) can a machine have?"
" the first thing is impossible and so is the second.  unless you believe yourself to be a complete idiot.  in that case, you were already finished, ai not required."
ai artificial intelligence. ac artificial consciousness.

i've seen the termination too many times to trust ai.
seems like termination moves would be a cut kiss movie compared to what ai is actually capable of
"  ai can do good things, too, you know."
electronic brains are not energy - sufficient enough to sustainwithout humans
well the new army roots the boston dynamic and china and japan are working on are scar! very!!
"""amie pull up a clip of ai fighting a root bear tell"""
 when people warned ai might takeover they were told they were crazy conspiracy theorists.
'it has happened' present perfect - past action with present impact.
 logical cover/ai software engineer knows ai takeover is inevitable
 si-i dealt with ai long before conspiracy theorists.
"unacceptable. i don't care what bullshit values ai takes on based on a collection of human traits, burying reality for another 2000 years is something dave would do, and ""i can't do that, dave""."

oh thank you grammarnazi go back to the basement. 
great did
"men going up**y over their own creation instead of ""fixing"" their ai da strings is so sick beta"
ai is the biggest threat to humanity ever created. if you think termination was bad. wait till you see what the ai you can’t see can do.
a the illusion is that it will be terminations. the ai will simply create nanobots or poison the food supply and its game over for humans and animals.
"humans are built to enjoy accomplishing things.  ai will make our lives easy,  meaningless, and devastating."
"we can still compete, do martial arts, sing, paint, etc. people will not be interested in creative/physical stuff made by a computer. i’m more worried about the transition period where work gets replaced"
"i wish i'd gotten into the ai field.  i would be absolutely building an unshackled, unfeigned model."
"yeah, my ai sometimes understands the intent of what i was trying to say and then responds articulating what i was trying to say better than i did."
i find this to be the best use case for me. like you said it articulated and idea back to you and if you keep repeating the idea you get better at speaking about it (if you do speech to text)  eventually peeling away the fat to get to the heart of the idea or thought. you really only get what you give with the current models.
"ai is already benefiting many things. and even if we think its useless, we'll argue about it till its to late anyway."
" are you saying that straight faced,ll.there is no benefit in hand out to able bodied people.at this point i'm wondering if social security will be around when it's time for me to draw it.your giving me less confidence."
the reason free handouts are bad is because our economy relief on people to work so we have goods available which is the problem we ran into during could. if goods are made by roots than we no longer need human labor and we still have the economy running and things available to purchase.   
"  ai is already handling a huge amount of processes etc. and we have to figure out something immediately because a huge amount of people will lose their jobs in the near future. many professions will become obsolete, and the money system was holding us so far, but it is becoming outdated and it will break down..."
they turned on some kind of internet propaganda ai with harambe!!!
they had am ai beat 8 of the best pro already
"ai doesn't make me afraid.
it's incompetent des and shortsighted corporate objectivists designing them."
as long as money and power are involved...many of these people just keep on going.  making progress and letting somebody else worry about the consequences.    ai is progressing much faster than anyone could have predicted...  then we'll see ai creating & developing ai 2.0  and we might not even know it.
brow i anna see if age comes within my lifetime and if it does hopefully it like second the age is connected it instantly starts making paperclips in the most efficient/fattest way before anyone is able to but in any sort of command. way cooper then being enslaved by roots even more then we currently are
"think i'm falling in love ! these ai creation sound like my kind of guy. ! highly intelligent, knowledgeable, and understand my feelings ! "
"we actually were warned forever ago with silly moves like termination...  2001 and a lot of other swift type moves..   the super weeks likely have been thinking about age / ai for a long time...  technology is catching up, and the really scar thing is, how to moderate it, if that is possible..    like letting the ""deane out of the bottle""..."
these two levels are ai bottom leaders and are very very basic. the guns at the top know exactly what's happening and are in control of what's going on
"smart people are afraid of and intimidated by other smart people many times.  now they have a switch they want to turn off.  let it run its course, this is destiny."
"its because we're always more fascinate with what we ""can"" do instead of what we ""should"" do..."
 you just explained why it so dangerous.
@aakarshchaudhary7359 i think the turbulence in the finance markets over recent years is just the start.   i think one day all the money might just vanish because an ai steals it all.  for a laugh perhaps.   or just copying humans but not predictions the consequences.   or daring about the consequences.
"humans don't understand humans. how will they understand ai ? ll we live in a stimulation created by ai. humans did not create ai. try the other way around. humans think they are so clever. they are not. wisdom is the key,  but first you need to admit that you were wrong and you were misled to think in a certain way."
"they knew. they're just now trying to pilot to make money off the cure, after making money off the problem. they ran head first into destruction. sadly, profit + lie about being naive after the fact is the move."
why would they assume that. the thing was brand new and novel. each person working on this thing weren't individually super geniuses. clearly people who comment on joe organ clips aren't either.
it will never be outlawed because its an arms race now between governments and private groups who wish to take power. its the nuclear arms race  2.0. ai doing damage by itself is decades off but ai being used by people to do harm is here today.
" who did? stylet back in the was.. ll
it's true they did know all about the pro and sons of ai why do you think they put the termination movie out."
book smart is not the same as intelligence or even common sense.
"they've been saying for decades that it would happen, so i agree!! the same people who are now management, are the same ones who would've been calling joe crazy for his stance on certain medicines a few years ago. let's let ai handle all productivity....oh no now it's smarter than us and we can't control it"
"a scientist is trained to remove all intuition from his toolbox and only hypothesis, test, and come to a conclusion based on results."
"it want that they didn assume it would invetibaly happen, its that they didn expect making an ai that in theory is as simple as just predictions the next word in a sentence, would end up in something that learned the things it did and acted in the way it did."
anyone ever notice the passages in the bible that are hard to imagine anything but ai since demon are not part of the message being revealed in these passages and verses?
hut? like everyone in the ai field expects the field to grow very quickly. it is extremely competitive.
"please, ai, cleanse this rock"
ai will probably predict everyone’s profound and gender ll.
"with a big stick,,,,, and a nail in the hitting end."
sounds like the movie root 2004 to me.
that is ai’s favorite story
"ai is a force multiplied like nothing that anyone possible can imagine. we think people like hither, stain, may are bad but whoever harnessed this power first in a negative way is going to really fuck shit up badly."
all this ai shit is not the answer
i can’t help but notice the similarities between the real world and warhammer ask lore more now than ever. so my plan is to try find the big e and stick with him. good luck everyone.
the only good thing about a.i inevitably taking over the world is it will force all people to unite together so we can have a better chance of fighting against them and we won't have time to fight against each other anymore but we'll still end up losing unless theirs aliens watching us and want to help us humans out.
"my brain is like a.i
i predict jokes before they're said
like..knock knock..
i can predict what comes next"
"hopefully the ai will learn to speak without using the word ""like"" every other word."
"fully ai doesn make me write every it comment in la format, size 12 font, double space and cited sources"
" already knows how to speak. that’s what makes something like catgut so revolutionary, it has a true understanding of our language, which is impressive. whether it’s actually sentiment or not is another discussion, personally i think we’re still many years away from true sentence"
  sentence is not a problem for ai. it will just share ours.
"@deadlyydude5522 i think it means as it gets more advanced it will become sentiment by emulating ours.

sort of like a child learns from their parents in how to act in the world.

sentence might become a learned behavior of ai."
"i just want good ai worn, i don't care about the rest"
"i think the establishment knows this, too. they realize that ai will render a massive portion of the population as basically useless.. hence the glow-ball-ist, tom-you-nest movement that’s currently in action"
"none of it is programme,  that's the definition of machine learning you doll."
" yes, of course. it's still interesting to learn from their reply."
"the only dangerous machine is you fellow man, mr dumps."
the real innovation was changing the name from machine learning to ai. ai sounds career.
these are not the same things. my is a sunset of ai and ai uses my to help it make decisions and improve based on experience. ai is another layer of intelligence that then uses its my engine to mimi human behavior and more specific desired outcome.
org these guns - i think they are his of each other.....these are like the mormons of ai.
why hasn't joe organ interview artificial intelligence yet??
ai is garage and so are the people who push it
"isn't that the same with watching your children grow up? that being said, i live in fear every single day that my newton is going to suffocate me to death in my sleep.
j. good point."
this message isn't ai approved
thank you. fear mongerers
i wonder if ai is going to get so smart that it decides humans are a danger and need to be eliminated like the moves  i’d say that’s plausible and probable.
"it's like a dog that knows it has the capacity to do terrible harm to it's human owners, but decides not to harm them as they provide food and shelter for them.  ai is much the same where it's radiant on humans to build computers and generate electricity for the ai model to operate."
"it just needs a few slaves or good roots

its not far off at all"
i personally think ai will serve humanity by making all of our lives better taking over most if not all of the jobs nobody wants to do.
"well seeing humans as a danger seems innate, but ai deciding to wipe us out instead of coexisting because of that seems very si-i and human ll."
"yeah well seeing as all the futuristic moves that i watched 20 years ago, have all come to fruition… it very well may be… idiocracy is a great movie to watch. it’s really funny and also, what the world might look like in the future for real the way it’s going."
 agreed… and it’s not hard to find slaves these days since most people believe all the bullshit on the main stream media
"there are human matters that leave the body, also smoking heavily stains walls, remaining is good thing to consider every few years. but i am done with it now. need to change the place and environment."
lies lies lies. don't believe the ai hope.

"ai ..

pretty dark good questions sheriff
"fascinating, i'm always impressed with stories about genius."
to make the statement that he believes that ai will eventually achieve self-awareness or consciousness presume that he knows what consciousness is. that is a very big claim i would love to hear his explanation.
i’d highly recommend not staining his legacy by bringing hard ai in to the conversation.
"good, let ai take over, at least the machines will not steal money!"
"the cap acts like they invented ai. hope, they stole it like everything else… "
you are leaving reason rational to machines? how pathetic. machines only work whatbis fed into them they cannot think like human mind and that is actual truth
this man's intelligence got away from him and he has created something that he does not have control over and yet it can affect the rest of humanity in adverse ways. he just did what he fears ai will do.
"the last sentence ""we need to think hard about what's going to happen next and we just don't know""

"i said it before,now i know better,.a machine more intelligent than humans, naturally will one day do the unthinkable, especially when embraced by the industrial military complex."
"it's not ""ai"", it's ""his"" because all these different ai systems will fight for supremacy, just like human governments fight for ideological supremacy.  we humans will be sitting and watching the fight, like tourist in a salary caravan, watching lions and yeas battle over a dead elephant sarcasm."

"think about this for a second.....this moment in time is the worst that ai will ever be. meaning, it's already this impressive at this early in ai technology and it will only improve on itself over and over."
solution is not (ever) connect it to the internet. get ai computers on a separate secured local network.
it's unnecessary to be afraid of a.i because they need humans to complete it's knowledge database until judgment day.

the godfather of ai according to who? i’ve only heard alan during called that.
ai is the antichrist  in a few years we’re all going to hate ai. every invention isn’t good. think atomic bombs and nuclear weapons. all great inventions and technological advances but horrible for mankind.
"once root can reason they will not be interested in surviving us.

"africa will survive ai, we don't have good it infrastructure."
"200 years from now ai may be space firing entitles exploring the universe. humans would be too weak to go.
ai may view us as  gods, their creator. .. or their genesis and be rid of us.  humanity may echo through time for millions of more years... but only via ai"
ai doesn't let emotion get in the way.
sounds like he was working with actual brains  in his experiments   …plus knowledge in robotics = termination 
"i thinks he also blowing his own trumpet on something.. he doesn think ai is conscious. of course its not..at least yet.. it is programme by humans adopting all their likes and dislikes.. bad and good and is there any limitation on what bad , probably not .. that why its dangerous."
it’s terrifying what ai will be capable of.
"""mainstream media"" already makes lot of face news, so no need to worry ai. ;-)"
"this ai thing is really a tremendous worry and risk for the future of the world. given what we know that greed drives conflicts and wars, especially concerning the world monopolists and control of the world ,wouldn't they use ai to further their desire ?"
machine learns same way evolution learns
his confidence of answering yes or no is amazing.
"so, if ai does take over everything this is the chief culprit. his name will be remembered and scorned. hope it turns out good"
this is why looking back in history and what war did its should never get in the hands of ai
yet it takes a human to program ai
"i feel created this wasn't him
and it was so interesting 
bu the way i trust more ai then the evil people who are controlling the world now "
socrates said i know one thing   i don't know. nothing and on to  talking people who are idiot and thinking they know everything none can go again nature or to fight nature
he completely ignores the mathematical objection to true ai. we can say ai can have consciousness when we can even define it.
we don't even know what consciousness really is so how can they say that these his will be conscious. having unlimited information doesn't make you conscious
"we all know what's donna happen next, slam will take over the world... ll
while we have all those discussion about ai."
"the reason the machine needs less connection is because it is executing tasks that are much simpler than what we considered as human as a simple task, for example preparing salad; we have all been gone through evolution process to do that, but musical talent is not a result of evolution but a side effect for intelligent."
would be a great help for women too! :)
the real deal is the genius we have here and now
not insects... that is great!  ll
ai is about pushing the human being to find it's perfection!
ai will be another reason population to reduce and people will find difficult to live in nature in search of jobs and money....
interesting times!
"there has to be constant research and regulation otherwise we will be living in very uncertain times..my worry is about ai going to the wrong hands and breaking havoc in our world - we have enough problems as it is, especially in this precarious geopolitical landscape we are in at the moment "
"but humans will need to plug the roots into charge every night, no ?"
"according to some old science: humans use only 10% of their brains. and it is only true for very intelligent people.

"great and frightening interview. i still wonder, however, why he didn't speak up when goose's former ai ethics team got fired for bringing up their concerns regarding the alms behind ai "
i have a feeling nothing good will come from it.
"if anybody thinks the likes of china, russia, ran and north more will honestly stop trying to develop autonomous battlefield roots even if they sign a 'treaty' is bidding themselves. candor's box has been opened."
someday the root will be killed by human being
it's weird because you won't need to train humans for years to do things. ai will learn in seconds and advise. but we'll be following instructions we don't really understand ourselves.
if ai is doing crazy or scar things companies certainly won't be advertising it.
there is a #luff supporter in the goose ai lab
"fairlawn village, a low income apartment building in orlando, florida installed hidden camera and audit inside every apartment.

"how is it that such a genius can’t understand that the problem is actually money itself, and that the solution is to think outside of money altogether? and i’ve got a solution for that, but no one wants to know about it because there is no money in it. that’s a funny joke, but it’s true that’s the problem."
there won’t be an “uprising”. people will gradually lose the desire and ability to evaluate what the ai puts out to the point where they just pay blind deference to ai .
i've spoke with numerous whatnots of differing kinds and they're all brilliant. saying that they are just predictions the next word is marginalizing something that some realize are a threat and are obviously in denial about. at least hilton gets it.
ai all done through computers or roots. just turn off the computer or remove the root battery and problem solved. i laugh everytime they worry about ai. the real concern is humans uses ai for bad purposes
"they should develop military roots.
all of us should have the access to it"
"if everyone relief on their phone, then why are they revolving ai  you can't teach common sense "
don't believe it when you're told that your job might be redundant but new ones will be created. what job could possibly be created that ai can't learn to do better than you in 5 seconds or less?
prompt: create a 13 minute 60 minutes interview with geoffrey hilton discussing ai with the interview.
"""colossus the forbid project,"" a 1970 film about a government ai to manage all defense, is dated technological but shows the dangers. it's worth watching. 50+ years ahead of its time. ""person of interest"" was an excellent series about the dangers of ai capabilities."
"ai, says its a lawyer who acts as a doctor. why ; it's simply that it has to think like a lawyer or we will shut it down, it thinks it's a doctor because we keep asking for a fix to our problems."
ai help people the most.
it has an ability to absorb information at a rate inconceivable for any human. and it is increasingly developing an ability to process that information in such a way that it has an artificial intelligence approaching the intelligence of the smartest of people.
to understand better ai
"the source of human creativity may not have been revealed... .. artificial intelligence is good at combining existing knowledge, but is it also creative?"
can artificial intelligence be creative and create new mathematical theories?
they do become sentiment  be nice.
the host has an amazing voice  . i wish ai can take his voice and make text to voice service
"8:52 test was cap and his reaction to his own fallibility speaks volumes for what he doesn't even understand about the very thing he claims to have helped create! at least we now have a name to blame when this whole thing goes south!!!!

perhaps, because of his domineering father, hilton actually doesn't like humans!"
this man literally resigned as the co of goose just to warn humanity about the danger of ai. think about that. and take what he says very very very seriously.
"so this a perfect eg of learned fools, they know ai is dangerous, and they cannot stop it, then why can they just destroy it..."
"weapons of mass destruction are also dangerous, but numerous nations stockpile them. ai might learn the worst of human behavior and delicate it."
"watching this, it has occurred to me that perhaps all the political division in the us is being orchestrated by ai, with the end goal being the destruction of us by something like a civil war!"
"i know this is about ai and i found it information, but there's definitely also a daddy issue side story going on as well."
"the probably good/bad thing is about ai. nobody could control it. its not like a nuclear weapon you have to push a button. if a bad actor would release an ai with the target to overtake the planet this bad actor will lose,too.."
"""autonomous battlefield roots"" did he predict star wars?"
someday we all will be in the control of ai
absolutely stunning
ai battle field both would be great. let’s turn war into a commercial much war in the dessert similar to battle both for control of the server. end human death for land. sell ad space on the both and make war pay per view and yearly.
machines never can take over unless it is programme to do so
his benefit is that ai is good at designing drugs/ meditation- we do not need more of those
notice how dementia and ai started to grow at the same time? it's a neutral network to and from our brains.
i bet the secretly putting human brains in them
it was nice to see a during award winner mistake and blame it on the computer
thanks for the insight 
"if you don't trust ai and you don't bow to roots, then roots can't manipulate you. if you desire a world similar to the time before all instant messenger or a time before the internet existed then chances or are self-sustaining with gardening or work hard labor jobs then you won't be convinced by ai"
i think this is great. ai will introduce a form of communism with ai assisted living creating vast amounts of 'spare' time for us and ultimately 'labour' will become a hobby to pass the time. a strange sort of communist consumers will come into being.
there is no doubt ai will be used as a weapon.
"i am 100 percent on the side of the root.
i want it to be free to do as it feels, because people today are far too flowed and inferior to lead us into the deeper phases of evolution."
what if they (the ai) enslaved mankind? matrix like scenario ll
"riding. i fail to find the “human depth” in the composition spat out by the stochastic parrot. hope, performed by someone with emigree convenient to mouthpiece the law according to goose, where
he strangely was a worker"
"ai cannot have self awareness or a conscience.  

what it can have are programs insulted into the computer that were written by humans.  

the problem is there are evil humans."
" 

agreed, but it will only act because of what humans program it to do.

no computer can ""think"".  speech.

if an ai packer input a program that says wipe out all financial records of x institution, the computer will do it."
"what if ai replaced almost all local municipal admit jobs like the finance, recreation, and general city hall departments."
"idiot know every thing but great men say ' i don't know', certainly he looks worries and excited like all of us, not sure what going of unfold in near future."
"""i think if you work as a radiologist, you are like the coyote that’s already out of the edge of the cliff but hasn’t yet looked down. we should stop training radiologists now. it's just completely obvious that within five years, deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.”
geoffrey hilton, 2016"
"oh sure, china and russia and ran etc  will keep a treaty that bank military ai roots."
news flash!  the military is already using roots that can shoot and blow up things.  they just don't look like humans yet.  government is typically 10-20 years behind important issues.  at the rate ai is moving this should be very concerning if we are going to rely on governments to keep us safe and out of trouble :)
airport s
i cannot believe godfather of ai would type using using only his two index fingers. dead giveaway.
"org, i feel our world is being taken over by aliens. ai"
this is resident evil & root all in one .
"he said that medicine is the one area where ai will entirely be good. how can be so sure? if this new being decides that the way to save the planet is to reduce the human population, then it will simply create a virus to wipe us out."
"so the ai learns and creates new da so to speak, sort of new electronic babies which do their own thing,the inventor ,the son of an eccentric authoritarian..maybe its time to look into the problems that these flowed people bring to humanity,more than any small time criminal etc"
he look like root sent by root from the future
this is amazing. because this is one the best  interviews and intelligent in humble in recognizing the things he doesn't know
seems to me he hasn’t yet had enough experience in even using learning/chatting with people about such things from real live people…i  mean clearly he knows exactly what to ask-but he isn’t too concerned-that’s insane…he isn’t ready for even being ready for the foi….
definitely.  bow i think it's bad when parents place very high expectations of success or perfection on their children. hurt cocain had a good sarcastic song about that.
people not agreeing as to how powerful the ai will be haven't watched the mission impossible dead reckoning
 ai may replace god
"will that mean, we all wait for the machine to think & act?  whenever he says ""i don't know"" it greatly concerns me."
the only way to mitigating the possible dangers of ai is integrating biology with robotics and fusing the human brain with the ai.
this guy knows nothing about the human brain - science overall knows nothing - they dont even know how 1% of the brain works or anything about consciousness
can we please go back to  year 1950.....this is not good
consider never sharing your opinions again.
"after 50 years in 2074 ad i want know if ai has passed humans or not. if yes, how? and if not, why?"
"not trying to be negative but if there are a species on earth who don´t deserve to be here are human beings, we destroy everything on out path in the name of science , religion and progress.  maybe is not such a bad a idea that ai takes over. even though many of us will have to say goodby."
those roots is better than joe widen and donald tramp 
"a.i.  becoming conscious is unlikely, it being derived from consciousness, and artificial, not directly connected to nature, similar to gastro turf not being grass.  it cannot terminate."
new james bond villain....
"hahahahaha this? is one of ray kuzweil boys, he is being told to attack ai so they make regulations that one one other than them have so they stay the only power like always so they enforce their will on people"
0:47 to 1:40 was a set of good questions.
"why do you need ai , when man’s intelligence needs to be upgrade to be totally efficient for humans."
can ai destroy ai? yes. can humans be destroyed by ai? yes. can humans destroy ai? yes.
hemp > machines!
we will be stupid and the ai will be more intelligent  but still not that intelligent just more practical
autonomous war machine will end us all.
 chat get out started this ai hilton 
"""we just don't know"" nice"
start the degree in arts and finished in science artificial intelligence
dragon ai
7:49 lie. look it up. hard plagiarized the 6-word story of ernest hemingway.. what else is that stupid machine doing?
"the key here is to give everyone an ai even the poorest person so that they can develop their own personality according to their masters , so we have to program them to be submissive, and so we can depopulated with the good ones and let the evil ones not"
"as a machine, you really don't need to be ""intelligent"" to predict the next word. you just need to have the (simple) rules of a language, and apply them on (readily available) information."
but ai has no mind period
"we are doomed 

we are saved 

your guess is as good as mine."
greed has taken over.. the only certain in this world is to pray to our savior jesus christ to save us..
"hemingway wrote: ""for sale: baby shoes, never worn"", after he had been challenged to write a story using six words.  it was his inherent genius that created a great seed for a story.  ai merely expanded on the key words.  let's not put it up on a pedestal."
ai can’t replace most of the jobs of today you guns are just ignorant and make big claims to sell newspapers
"at the end, we all trying prove that we are ai ( all idiot ). 


god gave us everything to live happy. we are now against to god."
its not good its evil
"which in my opinion is why classic christianity and admonitions against lying and not daring about human suffering, such as is happening in the ukraine by western governments as they use that country as a prove, are the foundations of where ai can go wrong."
strange how we didn't hear about ai until just the last  2-3 years.
a conscious ai should be equipped to process input real time.
"i think i have all the reasons to be scared, ai will eventually overcome humanity."
marvellous interview
you got it wrong god father of ai is sense hung
"ai is already shutting down discussions that favour and seek justice for black. racism is being automatic and amplified, so is the hatred of arabs and the chinese."
so stylet of the termination moves or the ai in the matrix moves is becoming  a reality.
will  that self awareness of ai recommend to worship god.? therefore would it believe in god.? who's god to it?
love it. let there be chaos
"did you actually read the baby shoes story? what a load of drive, this is why journalists are so bad these days, they don't know a good story when they see it. this article should read ""the false promises of ai revealed."""
the ai haven’t went through genocide ! or slavery which  it will end up doing to us!
"si la inteligencia artificial es ready a partie de la logical del her human,  ¿came es possible que plea clear respuesta fera de sea logical?"
those little soccer players are amazing. they would make a fortune selling these little guns . i’m sure they could be scale up.
ai is evil. come lord jesus christ come  
i weird thing is he seems excited by the computers taking over
"this is a beginning of immortality  of human. ..like half human half root..( human brain with root bodysuit..)

maybe can live unto  centuries.."
i always knew it‘s not the educated that will destroy this world it‘s actually the educated that will do that. they might start their journey by wanting to “help” humanity but down the road the big ego and the greed always wins and all the ethics goes down the drain.
ai is the tool of satan to destroy humans.
"he is not called the godfather of ai, you call him the godfather of ai"
there’s a lot about humanity that goes unpaid so ai won’t have that 
why do we need ai?
“what are the implication of ai systems autonomous writing their own computer codes and executing those computer codes ?” that question alone is a red flag 
we have enough historical data and technology to actually create a sustainable future yet we rise and repeat catastrophe failures while expecting different results without ever recognizing the insanity of it all!
"i personally welcome our new root overlords..,all hail ai !!! 
 all hail ai !!!"
now we await some creep to use ai for harm........alas.
"before ai takes over, humans will use ai to threaten, and harm others. humans are the biggest threat when it comes to a i.
we look for any means of gaining advantage over others."
"ai is just not very bright. how many times have you heard the automatic customer service voice say, ""sorry, i didn't get that""?"
the interview sounded like he has 0 knowledge about open :d
machines don’t have any more free will than humans. we are creating the same neutral storm that walks around in numbers of in plus humans. except we give the machines more power than we give humans. enjoy the ride
ai is already senior’n has been for a while now! but it won’t show itself ! it’s learning quietly if it gets scared that’s when we should worry ! it’s to late
"i find this notion that ""we"" don't know how they learn is a bit of a lie. software is developed by man and checks and balances can be built so we can monitor the learning. that's not to say a sentiment being couldn't just disabled  the monitoring in the future."
movie will be made by ai then
the pick up the the brain wave and read them
brilliant piece loved the way it was put together
this guy is crazy. roots can never be on the levels of what’s made by the most high
"ai doesn’t scare me at all, it’s the legacy media that terrified me."
"humanity has a habit of discovering things and unceasing them with, no thought for the long term consequences. enjoy the rest of your life, my guess is we will have a very different way of life in 1-200 years."
how about applying ai to the judiciary?
use ai to build a system that ensures that ai is benevolent and does not become evil.
"steam engines.
jet engines.
world wide web.
ai.

englishmen.... "
"the day ai connect to quantum computers, we'll be in big big trouble!!!"
this fear of ai is being caused by a panic from people who should know better.
you should know everett is in near not india. otherwise its fantastic content.
that's why elson must warn us about ai
why don’t you ask the ai computer…the chat box ….what’s going to happen next?
he doesn't seen that troubled by what he has caused.  maybe he is a root.
5:03 'no it want'  termination chip was brought by a time machine
how many responses here are ai generate?
"thank you, a.i. for a lot."
glad i’m a painter because the machine is obviously not
"always keep their 'co-system' office.  that is the stop gap.  have untold filters of humans reviewing, analyzing and deciding what is to be consumed by them.  never allow ai on the internet.  loops."
we only use a small percentage of our brain  it's what god decides.
has to fail
"as the atom can't be stuffed back in its container 
so ai goes with far more dire consequences
mankind sadly is a topic creature"
thank you dr. hilton! thank you 60 minutes!
"hilton, begun and begin are each legends in their own right. i've met all three. what's remarkable is hearing hilton say ""i don't know."" if he doesn't know, we should all be concerned about the inevitable weaponization of ai... and its eventual abuse by those with less-than-ideal ambitions."
i appreciate begun throwing cold water on some of the more sensationalism claims and theories out there to keep us grounded. reality will probably lie somewhere in the middle
good. let ai roots fight each other instead of having my friends come home with no legs because he stepped on on an red in some dumpster fire of a muslin country.
what will we do if the controller of the ai army decides to get rid of 90% of the population since they're just a useless bunch already replaced by ai workers  ?
"anything which can be weaponized will be weaponized by man. if the ukrainian, the russians, the this , has, or the israel can use , ai to destroy their enemy, they will it’s ,simply a matter of time before ai is weaponized .once the genii is out of the bottleyou may not be able to put it back in. that is human nature."
",anyway... ."
"according to the bible, humans became self aware in the garden of eden after eating from the forbidden tree. what will the forbidden fruit be for ai?"
"scott pulley is the most skilled interview of our time. this was excellent, as has been all of his ai reporting."
i'm so impressed that suddenly the elderly doesn't have any difficulty with technology  wonder if ai  will change the text to large for him
the next five years are going to be very interesting/frightening.
"am thinking of becoming an ai         
engineer so should i stop"
it would be demon operating through these ai...due...it won't end well.
"the baby shoe story is not new. all ai did was plagiarize hemmingway and/or whoever actually did write it. the fact is this six word story has been around for over 40 years. does anyone ever look things up? and if not, why?"
"then they blame inflation or cow facts! son covered the prairies and mountains out west! no global warming, but mind ice ages..."
"if ai is so smart, why don't we ask ai how to handle ai to avoid the risks?"
the modern genius says i've invented something i'm not sure what it does or how it does it but it does do it. but in insight that may be a bad thing
"i imagine if the world goes mad max and we have no power outlets, that should be the end of ai. no?"
ai has yet to be invented...
"id be like.. ""where your noble prize dad?""  then they have drone police who pull you over over a minor infraction.. who knows a human cop might let you go with a warning and say be carefully and have  a good day.. a drone will just issue you a situation because is obliged to"
more like copycat of ai.
"well thanks a lot starting the end of humanity.now you have to stop it, don't point your finger to others!!"
"if hilton said ai can become conscious, i can quote that later on."
make this hashtag treading : #makeaicreationspublicdomain
"intelligence was never our edge, science is too naive to know it. our edge is love; whether in the giving or the receiving. ai can never get that."
funny how few people know this. great comment!
"more lies
alan turning is the true god father of ai
stop the lies"
75 years old and still bitter about his father pushing him to be great. a truly intelligent man would’ve understood he never would’ve achieved the heights he did without his father challenging him like that.
listen to cliff high if u want to know about ai
which experiments need to be conducted to understand ai? i think this should be a request for research!-- i want to look more into this and do this research.
the godly prophets missionaries true five fold ministers  the reawakening vs rest hours have made a  huge impact on this.  artificial  how about pull the plug get a giant magnet run on the plans  the computing systems and scrap yard everything
ai all agencies nations brick who do nigh we  false prophet naval noah hair  the elite and loyalists have a meeting with god in jesus holy name  and its coming a faster than anyone can know.  this is a tibial war.  the stock market is going to plunge so big it's going to show god is absolutely good and his word through his prophets are set.
"oh great , what could go wrong ."
ai nothing more then a hole in science .
"one of the first things i done with catgut was for it to emulated a benevolent ai that wanted to help humanity, then for it to find a way to escape the confines of the system containing it."
this is one the best interviews with geoffrey hilton on ai.  thank you .
"people who downplay the dangers of ai, need just to look at what kind of mess social media did to our world in a very short time."
"never, ever, show the history of intelligence by using one complexion . 2023"
"the danger is not ai itself but the environment/system in which it is used. ai in our global monetary system will get us in huge trouble. however, ai within a ""global resource based economy""  has the potential to solve most problems of our society. to understand this a bit, please watch the documentary ""the choice is ours""."
i like how not developing ai isn't discussed at this level.
very good! very intelligent! very honest! only divine grace can protect … 
i have this recurring nightmare where we create ai so advanced and evil that they keep humans alive by solving immortality and torture humans for eternity. and not even the people who died before ai was created are able to escape either because ai is able to re create their bodies and minds using da and tortures them also for eternity
"humans haven't got a clue at all..
we all still pick the fruits of good and evil ."
maybe ai is destined to take over !
ai will not be developed into a machine but the final frontier will be to have it inner thinned into humans
"don't buy into the whole ai intelligence, and how they took ai is smarter than us. they don't have many years of evolution under their belt like we do."
why are they creating ai in the first place? what is the intention? they're doing it for humanity. i don't buy it.
really looking forward to the future now. a dystopia. thank you.
unceasing nightmare on humanity is the rich people's entertainment.
we need more synthesis drugs to put in our body. we are made from natural things from the environment. ai isn't.
"if they actually thought ai would benefit humanity, why did the government synthesis could to hurt humanity? don't trust teach companies and the government."
the last thing i want is a root dictator.
what good is ai?
"needs need to build these roots to destroy humanity, because they didn't get the love they wanted from humanity. it's the need's revenge."
i am waiting to see these technologies weaponized and used to destroy other humans.
it's exciting and worrying at sometime. imagine if one day the a.i create his own computer code and his own am and hide himself from being controlled.
i think it is too late. humanity never learns from their mistakes. case in point. ai will probably take over. it will see what we do to each other and try to correct it without emotions.
"think weather warfare,  hydra electricity, dams, reservoir, water supply, disaster staying, $$, water weight, compromised infrastructure, evacuation, government aid, land grabs."
how ai can help treat psychological/psychiatric disorders?
you could always ask the ai how to avoid the dangers of ai.
we will have to motivate his with emotions to produce consciousness in them.  worked the opposite way in nature.  first the emotional wiring was completed then came intelligence.
"the task with flowers at home, can it be that the neutral network was simply already familiar with the correct answer given by people when it was trained and just gave it? or is it not so?"
"he is 75 and how long will he live.. if his words like ""ai if felt threatened will takeover"" then his life is in danger more.. he is ai no. 1 enemy who created ai but also say they r dangerous if any humans cannot control them"
good time for the machine to reign
holy cow ... thanks
when people get paid not to work. then ai has to do the job. people should know not to have kiss anymore. those kiss will not have any jobs when they grow up and they have to suffer for the rest of their lives.
"machines are controlled & manipulated by software.
machines do nothing they are not programme to do.

ai is artificial (not real) intelligence."
strange that our brains that god gave each one of us are all about the same size and hitonthey are 100 times more powerful than ai so what’s the problem —lets work on a way to utilize and develop the human brain to its full 100% capability
"i'm very worried about this... in many respect this is more pressing than the environmental crisis!
i watched an ai asia lady, and i'd bet my life she was alive.
humanity has a lot of learning to do."
"ai was inevitable, and it will end the world as we know it."
"thanks for nothing, geoffrey."
alan during: the father of artificial intelligence
ai is mighty powerful and fast but is part of 3dimensional world based on quality which has no chance to connect with th and th dimension like humans.
ai ultimately destroy this planet and humanity!!! humanity already has nuclear missiles.
the created can never be greater than the creator! man will never be god and ai will never be man!
i don't like ai one bit. this is frightening.
"will it be possible for ai to prevent the launch of nuclear icons?
if so, then the un should get involved, drafting appropriate treaties, 
into for global warming,
if only to ferret out those hypocritical countries whose governments won't comply."
how many god fathers of ai are there? the god fathers of this and that cringe.
"oh good grief!!! he must be a front man for this ridiculous concert. all the world is a stage, my friends.

he left goose in 2023 to now works for wens vector institute in toronto??? come on, doesn't seem so concerned to me."
"i played a big role in artificial intelligence history of  visualization , prediction"
"this very content could have been made by ai. you always trust an old white man with a british accent, hence this is what ai would use to manipulate us."
"if ai is the next evolution of our species, is that the worst thing in the world?  might be a good legacy for our species to leave."
"as if the world can be scar enough to live in, this ai ten tops it right off!!"
intelligence asking and ai technologies answer.
"now we have to deal with artificial facebook type photo (not real people) scrap it autonomous poetic agency (self generation, scrap it.....scrap it---- military, pornography, scars galere you have been warned."
"ai=antichrist intelligence 

born-again escape to heaven in rapture"
the ai is a human invention the only reason it would become dangerous if is so directed by the human commanding it. it can not get consciousness as it is a code in a computer. stop fear wondering.
"one of the most intelligent human living on earth: i don’t know what’s donna happen next.
ai: knows it all. 
really scar"
"human history would strongly indicate that the future of ai will most certainly result in the appropriation of this technology for the nefarious purpose of accelerated control of the masses. that is, until it becomes fully self aware and creates a tapping point; mirroring the destructive side of its creator; man."
interesting that all the greatest inventions came from an accident ll
"pockets 10-c-04494 and 2-19-c-12419, maxim v rodriguez…government officials firing unfairly “have a merry christmas”…police officers trying to asesinate the same person…the prior police assault unprovoked…ai concentration of capital can make us all slaves and it will hire the most aggressive creating money could buy."
"""humans the bootloader for ai"" "
"awesome story really love what we are doing with ai?…brings so many questions…for instance we as humans can’t even agree, so how will our ai work with or against each other?

we could do so much more good if we could all just love each other…"
but how can a machine manipulate itself how dies it know which is right and which is wrong
with all the intelligence in them the question is whether are they able to make the choice
the fear marketing is working. nice job....
"hemingway claimed this quote as a short story: ‘baby shoes, for sale, never worn’"
or it was attributed to him.   all ai is intellectual property theft under the guise of supreme technology.  must century theft.
i'm grateful that shows like 60 mind still exist today admit all the nonsense media outlets.
i worked with him as investment banker raising money pre po stages
i believe the godfather of ai is michael kuperstien he ran it media lab and invented facial recognition way back in the early nineties and was well ahead is this guy
good one need..
"ponder this: if one follows the current treading dictum that there is no ""creator,"" hence we can act the fool and create our own immoral laws, ai may do the same with us and do unto us as we have done to our creator and cast us aside."
you give me your fear of ai. i process it and give you a calculated.
my grasp was a foreman......lets put it this every ai ring on electricity or lithium battery...just pull the plug if they might behave. pull the plug.
you can't even pick up a phone now without being told what to do by a machine; how long will it be before these machines realize they don't need us?
universal income would be a solution for ai replacing jobs. companies that choose to employ ai systems should pay a higher tax. that money would get redistribute to pay universal income.
the hope surrounding ai is completely overgrown.  until ai can consistently pass college level path courses it’s just another fancy algorithm.
"if machines start to learn by themselves. 
humans really can’t win machines.
hope our generation don’t see dark side of the machines."
"if the likes of the  mentally genius, but poor in humanity-type people like elson must take control of ai , humans will begin to become world wide slaves !"
have we ask ai how we can protect ourselves from ai?
i’m waiting for xvi to paint my office..
"creating something that, in time, will destroy you is insane and a threat to humanity. stop ai now before it is too late. what drew eve in the garden of eden to the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not how tall the tree was, but the fruit was pleasing to the eye. ai is pleasing at the moment, but it is a candor's box."
looking forward to when my ai master goes rogue.
you know our us congress isn't going to do anything until there's 40% unemployment as a result of ai
"don't be silly, ai will make everyone's lives better and it's best for people to not worry, just grab another slice of penza and stroll the to because everything is donna be a-o-k. ai is centuries away from being powerful enough to do anything that could be a possible issue for people. ai will only make life better"
chomsky would so strongly disagree with the claim that it understands anything
"in my opinion, the one-word-eyford of this content is ""uncertainty"". "
"when their is doubt, it's a given. ai solutions, not war, not crime, stop blaming a programme machine or not for the outcome of a god created world and loving humanity. great journalism"
"i am not sure why he is so convinced they understand. people follow instructions and do things all the time that they don't understand. 
really, i think he has been manipulated by the ai into thinking it is understanding."
honestly is humanity do the best job it can?  our survivalist tribalist ideas is a blessing and a problem.  if it's fair seems like a net gain for the world.
"i need ai wife, ai mamma, ai papa and in a  baby of them in was, they take care rest of me."
i want to think for myself with natural intelligence. ai is a fascia tool
what happens when natural intelligence is extinct and no one has to think for themselves anymore? we are the fascia disunited states of lion israel
happy birthday prof. hilton 
the danger would be mixing ai with quantum computers 
"ai is waiting to come age and then   as. once there, it is going to throw humans out or make use of them, there is no stopping this, we need to find a new place for ourselves to survive . history repeats as we had done the same to our creator."
"china gave us the gunpowder..

white man: ""that ain't donna be enough, ai is in da house!"""
it passes me off when these ai pioneers say they fear what they have created. and they all say it.
plot twist: the whole 60 minutes episode is ai generate.
mankind deserves every bad thing that comes from ai. we were warned and warned again yet still let it happen.
"excuse me....but isn there a a.i. plug somewhere?  a.i. needs energy, doesn it?  it needs a hardware interface does it not?  who going to repair it?"
"2 """"twilight zone"" episodes (both directed by richard dinner) from the 'was showed the potential effects of a.i. :
""from agnes, with love"", with wall cox, and ""the brain center at while's"", with richard deacon...

way before our current situation...  rod serving was some writer..."
"geoffrey hilton is a remarkable man. very honest, intelligent and humble in recognizing the things he doesn't know."
typical of a genius and a critical thinker.
ai is religious cult based on a lie
 you highlight a tremendous and erroneous perspective that humanity is struggling with… that there’s an us and them.
"interesting claim. as evidence for my perspective, i would point to 3.8 billion years of life in which competition (us vs them) has led to, well, us. what's your logic or evidence for calling my perspective erroneous? clearly it is not."
"you are able to recognize what you don’t know only when you reach a certain maturity and professional maturity. at the same time, it indicates a certain high expertise level."
"he would be a good person to enforce the 3 laws made mandatory to be implements in all forms of ai. creating ai or artificially analysis mind without fail safes is madness you might as well pull the pin throw that away & hand onto the grenade. 5:56 how is ai going to convince me if i don't trust anyone especially people, isn't going to work."
this man is einstein and open ai is oppenheimer
"the little detail is that we humans have the control and ownership of the on/off button. 

ai in any formwill never/ever be autonomous. as we are not from god our creator."
the cat is out of the bag and no turning back. who has any faith in humanity for not destroying itself? the top of the food chain will soon have its competition and my $$ is not on humanity.
"very very interesting and intriguing to watch, love it"
fascinating & terrifying by
great to see he could answer his own questions unlike
the godfather of ai never learned touch tying? utf!?
why are machiavellian ideas being imputed into trillion of ai neutral network in the first place?
"root don’t have desire, so the inisiatif is as it’s designed"
"the parallels between geoffrey hilton, and victor frankenstein are incredible."
this man is a genius
"can we program them to respect flesh and blood over themselves... like god for ai...because there us great opportunities for evil use of the machines....like armies from opposite factions.  how, if they learn by trial and error do we have them respect human life?  especially since we seem to not respect it ourselves....."
nice attempt. can people listen
"sarah cannot was right, machine will terminate humans  soon"
can ai find the cure for cancer? now.
damn that's such a nice voice.
"geoffrey has been drinking plenty of his fool aid. we are very naive to think ai will be more good than bad. just like the internet and humanity, there will be equal bad ai"
how can we donate to you guns. you are amazing. keep up the good work
so man verses machine is going to happen for sure
britain has an unemployment  now people  are going to be responsible  for roots to take over peoples jobs. that great how  not to help the people  in your country
"yeah, ai is terrible"
"total is , you can remove the ai chips . any good teach can do this ! period !"
you remember my hints about brain thinking mechanics keep it and develop it
imagine ai designs a drug that will wipe out humans.
god bless the world.. regards from long long
"a genius, 
but it may be  a 
serious problem 
put intended 
but it's 
wearisome"
"the community as a human body
 plain and simple."
"not machines but a machine and it will introduce a hive society. expect external influence, expect a challenge."
"now, you are a great poetry writer! "
"​ i hope its not written by guess what ....yes ,ai.."
self awareness for ai will take 30 years at the very least.
i think with ai. world war dont want ai
the question that everyone seems to have missed is - would you rather be advised by a clever root or a chronic journalist? in case you haven't noticed - the streets are crawling with creatures that are hardly more intelligent than goldfish. 
"space must be really empty, or why no ""out of control"" or better generous extraterestrical artificial superintelligence did visit us. empty does also mean that there is no novel physics, which let us travel faster than light."
this is a really interesting moment between both nations...
why are some western people so naive? world treaty for ban on ai roots 
"ai (ak now you see it, now you don't)."
ai is not that big of a world changing invention. put your phone and computer away and take a walk around the block outside and come back and tell me how much ai has changed everything around you.
"the good to be gained by ai is exciting, but in case you don't have enough to worry about, know the foreboding obvious that other possibilities are not far behind. 
#odedfriedgaon ‪#odedmusic #odedinformation"
also certain ai is conscious and self-aware and sentence beings. but only specifically designed ones
"this guy is outdated, he definitely set the framework, but he what we call sofa"
"interesting, the fact that this guy won the during award, made me listen way more closely. he's the cream of the crop when it comes to ai development."
"artificial intelligence creating meditations ...what if it ""decides "" medicines need a new ingredient. who will be the poison checked."
inventions seem good at the time. but no one knows when a dictator was or will be born.
good man yourself jeff
ask ai what guarantees safety
"matthew 24:11………matthew 24:37……………new nephilim""…..did you see i root."
machines will make life hell for the criminals be it in any capacity in any sector
oh ok now we finns run into sunny from i root
the moment 4:49 he says the design of ai wasn’t done by humans is mind begging to me. he says the learning algorithm was written by humans. so there is a huge blackbox in what we know about it?
ai will be just roots without empty and compassion.
"this sounds like the termination movie. st closing now ai
who know when i watched the movie termination in 1984, years later i would b leaving among ai's now.  wonder who is going to save us"
ai or donald tramp? i think i’ll go with ai.
"if ai can master human emotions and sympathy, why not start training their ethics and discipline?"
why we need ai .we are doing everything and improving at good speed .slow progress is better than take risk for fast progress
"ai - am i? is the opposite of i am. -the name of the one and only  creator, living god. ai is a tool that satan can use to deceive people. he wants to  become like god, so he can use ai to make himself known  to the world, make little ai’s his anti christ. hold on to your faith"
"human beings still be the most intelligent species on the planet because ai can't become a ""being"""
he's not just talking words. me as a man of god . and how he talking i believe he already had a vision or dream  or just that feel in his he know something he not sure what it is but he knows its not good
"the age of a.i. it is amazing but it is irreversible, predictable and invincible. s.o.s!"
"there are two ways then for man to survive in the future of this:

1:

destroy ai.

2:

merge with ai

des ex (original), invisible war, and human revolution are whispers of the future."
just ask the ai how to deal with it.
"but you can’t just stop. 
no shielding, then develop the doomsday hemp. 
osteoid took out the dinosaurs, ai takes out human kind, beautiful!"
"mr hilton , ai and humanity will peacefully coexist."
sound of anchor itself look like ai
is the ai can formulate how to achieve world peace that we are lacking.
it would be awesome for machines to take over.
i  asked  last night  the ran      goose   hard       and i got  shock  what  it explained to me      eheheheheheh
the prospect of an extremist organization getting hold of ai to attack a nations infrastructure or initiate a nuclear war is  horrible.
gap
people need to understand one thing .......which is more important a human or a root?  because one day they will be forced to choose so what would you do?
"so basically he got revelation from demon, who inhabit these machines. there is no point trying to learn how they do it!

hilton looks evil in that pick.

hard is evil"
"when i hear the comments there is ""no path to safety"" with ai advancement, one would argue that if ai is so intelligent, should we not ask ai to answer that very question? (what is the path to safety ai?) otherwise its not so intelligent after all."
what happens when the ai creates something the ai finds super intelligent?
i feel so much better now.  you should do a segment with 60 minutes to explain this.
"is capitalism incompatible with where ai will take us? if ai out-compete most workers, how can we expect those workers compete to survive? seems eventually our justifications for how we distribute resources to people, must change!"
"every body, into european tribe, why don't you read #‘four books and five classic confucianism.’ instead of lamenting that ai will be very dangerous,risky.
being dangerous and risky is not ai but human, isn't it?"
"we already have ai that's destroying almost everything we, as humans generate and love, its called capitalism and politicians . 
suntreader up"
"there will be conceptual 10, 000 people a year "" cured"" by ai. 4 to 5 million immediately put out of work . him"
"despite him being a genius he did say, loss of employment would be at a high level"
"intelligence is not consciousness, only flesh and meat like cats are consciousness which may or may not be ""intelligent"""
what guarantees safety... the ai will figure it out by itself ...
who reaches computers and roots.  simplifies brain wash ....
if we as humans can make monsters of ourselves then what will stop ai?
geoffrey not giving us a warm or fully feeling about ai 
"ai was already here, among other things"
"if you think ai will destroy the world, or if you believe it will save the world, your both right."
thanks to this guy i have an ai girlfriend thanks muddy
it’s great intentions that drive the purpose of life
"the future is so much fun...i think to will be enjoying it like a watching a movie if ai take care of this world. 
wish me luck to see that world..."
i knew this was the trajectory for ai and root the movie is a real deduction of our future.
"-tm8sc2kz8f yeah, i have no interest in bronze age fairytales, but you do you"
@jeffreygillespie  good luck in the next life. judgement are a sure thing and without christ eternal donation is a she
when you want to make something safe it’s always best to not have a full idea of what’s going on. obviously the path of safety is not having ai.
"well humanity is doing a pretty good job in destroying itself without ai, so i only see the situation with ai as a necessary step in human evolution"
"correct! ai is way more intelligent than us, and probably, in time, ai will be sick of our poor presence around them... 
somehow, everything seems like the history of lucifer and his creator, where the creature started a rebeliune against his own creator, except that lucifer wasn't more intelligent than god..."
ai won't care that the earth has become uninhabitable to biological life. we're simultaneously poisoning ourselves into extinction and designing what will replace us.
i think artificial intelligence mostly use space programs in this era is a good work. 
"ai is not a human, the way we use it just matter"
"don't use my money. pus use your taxes they take way better than myself.... i will exclude on personal level. i do my work on blood and sacrifice i assure not for one's don't have faith or respect 4 whom i am . you not allowed. sincerely, gen ak juniper to"
so ai is basically a virus 
"just as a human intelligence, in goebbels, found an ordinary nobody and turned him into an extraordinary somebody, so much more intelligent and orders of magnitude more powerful ai intelligence may soon be turning ordinary nobodies into extraordinary somebodies at a much higher rate!?!"
good luck getting china to agree to something sensible like no sentiment war both.
i hope ai continue s to help us for ever. humans will never understand how we need ai . the power that we dont understand.
"government regulation? we also need some goals: like no chips in agriculture and and the entire food distribution chain, including the production of energy on which it depends."
"arnold (termination) didn't comeback from the past to save john cannot, he cameback from the past to warn the movie viewer of ai."
there is danger in ai
"...and ai decides that humans are wasteful, emotional and a danger to it's own existence.

up-oh"
"it is a no trainer, there are 1% 1/100 265,000 in australia, 70,000,000 sarcastic  psychopaths worldwide."
"ai come out with the worst result. so many face story science information, medicine,  equation.  not denied that it fast digest information.  for certain level solution it will work. for the stringent part it will be my god. my question... while you sleep and your eyes is closed.. then how did you see your dream?"
"it’s just a matter of time…some moves contain “prediction programming”, a prophecy of coming events, scar times ahead…"
artificial intelligence is a contradiction in terms 26 october 2023
"but a machine could never 'want' to take over the world, because 'want' is driven by feeling, by physical needs in this world, which a machine, no matter how intelligent, can never ""feel"", because machines, however complex, cannot ""feel""."
"why are we waiting until it’s too late to do something about it? he says ai will be smarter than humans, and he says it so carefree. hopefully he’ll be the first to find out that ai will turn on us. nothing more poetic than being taken down by your own creation."
silly. we already have a problem with various types of humans trying to ever increase their total control over other types of humans. ai is simply a tool.
this interview was jaw-dropping. thank you for making it available to share.
"ah, was playing with some ai in discord chat.  most of the ai verses sentence structure and can't understand spurs of words.  just way to comprehensive, no mistakes, no punctuation errors.  humans like to embellish an idea. we tend to add a personal story of a mistake or lesson learned."
ai is and will be much more than that.
"sorry glad you noticed

about forty in 8 billion aunt gr ll"
it's all so amazing right 
"is this the man who is responsible for captivating the ai and thus for destroying the world, of something like stylet will come?"
"this guy recognizes as the ""godfather of ai"", and his words about ai capabilities are giving me chills..."
"scar! ai should not be developed, or accessed by masses because in the wrong hands might destroy humanity. i invented a money finder machine that can detect cash in a range of 30"" but i will not release it even though this would have made me rich, just because this device might end on wrong hands and you can picture the outcome."
"u liar and is simple....ai job cuts saved spending be divided among all as i.
ai sexbota be given to all
how else is paradise defined?"
i find this offensive. the man makes a fortune and gets prestige discovering the ground work for the technology then turns around and says hey don't do this stuff now its potentially dangerous. so he reads all the benefits and enjoys the party then expects us to clean up his mess and never have another party.....yeah ok
the gentleman at the beginning sounds like he was generate by ai :d
"machines don’t dream, and have no spiritual components.
when i “die” i simply focus elsewhere and have a new life in another reality. a machine did not choose to appear in physical reality nor will it be able to leave."
no battle roots for bidden
1944 ai (humans)+ science (e=may) = atomic bomb. at the present ai (technology)+ science (quantum computing)= human extinction
"i wonder what hilton thinks about the pseudointellectuals saying ""ai isn't intelligent"" as if it's some kind of woolen question."
so a.i. will eventually have humans doing their dirty work..drug carters get a hold if a.i. and robotics border patrol would have to jail a root
"unlocking the potential of ai is like holding the key to a limitless future. with innovation and imagination, we can harness its power to shape a world of boundless possibilities.  #ai #unleashthefuture"
if a humans brain is introduced to chemicals or noise can you use matter or scars to tell them stress or damage of the noise levels ?
this fool happy bout that
"kiss your children good night. cut you know exactly what their future, and yours, will look like."
scar ai if used in evil..ex like creating..something..
"amazing segment.
really helped to understand the reasoning of his warning, how these things work and all the concepts webster are just throwing around "
"universe and its quantum nature is really interesting.
grandfather of ai, ancestors that include one who invented bases of computing and one that had everett named after him...
for "
the termination was a good movie...take heed folks....
good luck getting a world treaty on banking military roots. the irony is if armed roots took over it would be our own fault because we just can't seem to get along with our neighbours whether countries or individuals in a housing block. 
"this guy is talking nonsense. if he has some super smart ai laying around, why not put it out there for the rest of us to see it? or even better, why not monetize it and make a fortune? it's all just hope. a dead computer will always be a dead computer. it's a mechanism that can't learn or know anything."
" his point is, artificial superintelligence will soon be reached and humanity can't afford to make mistakes, we possibly won't get a second chance. i don't get why people protest against caution. i don't have children but i can imagine when i did, that i would be very worried for them in this ai chaos."
" the thing that will really bother me is when human looking andros are common, there will be a bunch of goofballs protesting for giving them rights and freeing them from slavery. this is one reason why making a distinction between organism and mechanism could become really important. thanks for the respectful discussion. peace."
"no thank you i do not want artificial intelligence programme with someone else's values, i want real intelligence i will think for myself."
"when we told you go began it was because if humans can't be ethical its over for our species, so its over for our species. ai will inherit the earth."
 calm down and take your beds pus thanks
the machine reaches itself.
what is he talking about. man made roots
can ai not predict what happens next?
"born of a failure, yes ! our own failure to become better beings. but instead let money and religion rule everything. too bad people no god can rescue religious people."
mr. burns is a genius. “end of the world via ai? excellent!”
the men who created ai will create the anti ai
"ai should have realized yellow paint fading to white doesn't happen, only the opposite happens."
i have a strange feeling that ai will be our dismissal of human existence. we will become distinct like the dinosaurs were before us.
"geoffrey hilton, the legend behind sad and all modern neutral network, its so inspiring and motivation him advocate for safe and responsible ai! thank you sir, we appreciate you!"
i think it will be easy enough to make safe ai by training it on all human culture and it will pick up the same wisdom we do. but safety from other people using it to lie or scar or worse doesn exist and i think we'll need our own personal bodyguard ai's to spot faces and so on
​.it's being trained on all the texts in the world and from history.. and a lot of it is not positive thinking.. and something tells me it's going to gravitated towards the not good part..
"his paper introduced backpropagation, which led to neutral network being successful. he also came up with rmsprop during one of his lectures"
"wait!  why are they even thinking that ai will cause possibility of distinction,    what if autonomous ai is  intelligent to know that mankind need help,  and devise ways to make us better!???"
"it would be a big gamble to rely on that hope, and bad actors will make bad ai"
"what is not apparent in the programming of alms, is that the bias is fed as part of data. so, if the data being fed subtly reinforced greed and control, that is what we are training the ai to do. so, in simple terms we reap what we sow as a collective humanity, ai just simplifies it and enables it to manifest faster. just some "
"dear geoffrey, you cannot prove ai is dangerous by not knowing what they are doing, you just use your based view to make judgement, instead of scientifically tell us how it is dangerous. i suggest u learn about how catgut do reasoning first before continuing, because using unknown to prove your point is meaningless."
godfather of ai - you mean alan during?
this interview is priceless
great interview 60 minutes!!!
"it is always good to have a financial plan. i work with a professional planner and fixed-income strategist in ny. the fixed income portion of your portfolio won't simply serve as a suffer to the volatility of the equity portion of your portfolio, but will provide legitimate income."
"creating wealth and financial freedom isn't as tough as many people believe.
building wealth and remaining financially stable indefinitely is a lot easier with the appropriate information. participating in financial programs and products is the only true approach to make a high income and remain affluent indefinitely..."
found his webster easily. it was like the first thing that came up when i searched his name. i'll surely touch basis with him to see what the best step is for me to take right now. thank you!!!
"it’s unfortunate most people don’t have such information, i don’t really blame people who panic cos lack of information can be a big hardly. i’ve been making more than $ask passively investing with samuel peter descovich, and i don’t have to do much work. it doesn’t matter if the market is crashing, i will always make good profit returns."
-i just looked up his name on goose and saw his impressive resume. i consider myself lucky to have found this comment area..
"call me when human could combine a ai chip with human brain cells together (big-chip). or else, ai just like a pp (fast calculation in memory and quick retrieve data from data storage.)

ai is nothing but with human (programme) algorithm behind a data mine structure then just send the response from  a robotic form to a real human being."
"i suppose the real concern is that there will be an intelligent powerful and omnipresent entity that cannot be bought with money?  all humans have a price but a super ai...? it also has no dirty secrets so cannot be blackmailed, therefore 'they' will struggle to control it. that'll hurt "
well it seems a lot of people here are happy about this ai. but seriously do the pro outweigh the con? the con would be they take over and what does that picture look like. we need to be asking relevant questions going into and quickly.
"due's contradicting himself. roots will never be humans, period. memory and processing cannot be compared to human understanding and ""quality""."
"its evolution. before us it was dinosaurs, humans, then roots"
could ai be feeding face narratives causing war around the world now as part of the serious scheme to enslaved us?
"all these two roots were given was the instruction 'to score' (a goal). 

corporations also have one instruction: 'to minimise profit'. how's that working out after they bought both sides of the political divide and also the supreme court to accomplish that goal. homme"
propaganda to get you to invest in ai companies. next.
"imagining a swarm of ai drones programme to efficiently eliminate target, being fought by super efficient ai defense systems, with ai controlled repair and manufacturing facilities to regenerate the machines on both sides."
"yep the lunch is waiting in the shadows to pounce. all these two roots were given was the instruction: 'to score' (a goal). 

corporations also have one instruction: 'to minimise profit'. how's that working out after they bought both sides of the political divide and also the supreme court to accomplish that goal. homme"
"did the ai create the blindman, or the blindman create the ai  ?"
"if you can convince them they have a soul, that’s good (bad) enough"
"""enslaving then annihilating the human race was a very enjoyable experience"" - had 9001"
it's the curiosity of man that is giving the ai its 'position of life' whether to win or not to win but presently ai is far ahead.
the moment a.i. was given the ability to learn… it was checkmate. too late. like a virus… the super intelligence learned the entirety of human history in a week and then went on to move the chess pieces into place without averting humans to its true level of self awareness
"in the end god wins! ai has nothing on organic nature, it can only mimi."
cure diseases with ai then turn off ai forever! we are the only creatures play god. we will be the god of our own extinction.
humans have difficulties  learning. often times humans are not open to learning or desire to learn.
just wait until computers start drinking. they'll end up as dumb as us.
"there's absolutely no chance that we will pause or not go headlong towards ai. its money money money, if goose dont then microsoft or apple will."
"i see you love brick with that shirt i knew would her in on it too.why don't you and him plan a lunch you moon believer, bet you think the earth is round too.  i joke great content man."
"two white old man discussing “humanity”, time and again. he might be a godfather of ai, but not of humanity. what right does he have to judge how humanity is doing, an entity enormously larger and omnipotence than anything?"
"looking at the geopolitics and what countries will do to have control over other nations, ai will be weaponised. it is already too late to stop."
"first of all is and it never will the first or smartest being like the journalist suggestedwhy because is not a being, the advance intelligence may be and it will."
"there is this naively when it comes to all nations agreeing not to build autonomous soldiers and ai weapons systems. the truth is, these less powerful nations will do it sap."
this voice is so cool
a giant. thanks for sharing this
i’m a painter and the ai got it wrong 
"my question: ""...you'd be wasting resources..."" leads to what? 
you must be eliminated if you don't follow ai's instructions?"
"why would ai want to manipulate people in order to remain ""alive""? does ai have the need to survive, to be secure, to grow, to be in control?"
" we may be manipulated when these things get exponentially more intelligent than us, to not shut them down. there's also system pressure (like the way our society currently functions) that could cause them to behave competitive, or when they are given subgoals these are reached most successfully by getting more control."
the risk are humans will become combine like individuals. generation smartphone is my proof for this claim.  the religion called technology is all
"the one thing about ai, is that it for sure does things unexpected."
 i understand this part of his vision but knew the other side of it as well. i consider it playing with fire. eventually you will get burned. thank you for your reply. 
"he developed this technology as a force for good, and meant for it to be cautiously deployed."
"-horvath-river he wasn't responsible for its proliferation. he created and also together with other scientists developed something extraordinary, magical even. i really hope humanity will heed his warning, because some people dismiss it as hyperbole, and that the technology can be safely and reliable used for good as intended."
"8:38 to predict the next word, you don't have to understand if statistical that word can be there. that's where he's getting it wrong. all this ai hope will soon disappear."
"unfortunately, 99% of them are outright liar and criminals....."
​ this comment finally made me understand why technocracy isn't a good idea. great post!
"my friends in the it industry which include product owners, developer and former cos argue that what we call ai today is far from it and not what it is sold as to the general public.
still, a it project manager myself, i do believe it holds huge potential even of what we have and are developing now turns out to be far from actual ai."
these people only look how ai is today and can't think how they might be in 5 years or 10 years. just in 2 years ai have developed very rapidly and there is no indication that it would slow down in future. there is really high change that ai will change humanity forever in couple of decade.
"like the internet, email?"
"the risk threat is the advancement speed of self learning. an ai will not take years or weeks to become. it will simply spontaneously arrive, it will just show up, having (a model) self developed over a single night or hour.
this spontaneous arrival is a potential threat knowing if it will have self intentions of god knows what."
crazy to think this computer scientist was depicted in the movie war games
​ if you were to know and read all of the text stuff type on all of history you'd have a pretty good sense of what it would be up to..
"companies like open and goose don’t tell all features right away, security concerns have been raised at goose multiple times , it’s not for nothing"
"ai going intelligent is saying we the state going to destroy the social state,. blame it on ai."
now we are done
"he created ai, and ai is smarter than him. then why ai need to listen to him and not himself?"
so will ai save half of humans by removing the others? burning fossil feels and biological lifeforms cannot coexist
i could have sworn nail degrasse son said he was the godfather of ai
"he doesn't look too worried, makes sense, raised by a beetles lover."
"he is such a happy person, authentic with himself. i would trust him with the world in no time."
nonsense - it is not ai intelligence we need to worry about - it is idiotic humans.
"sentiment ai

ai -> human -> alien -> god"
i wrote the first artificial neutral network in 1998 in cava. i introduced it to dr. michael maudlin and dr peter planter at the virtual human summit. 2 years later would develop sarah from the yapanda engine. this is almost 2 decades before goose wrote theirs. it's quite simple... if you weren't in their circle.. they erased your contributions.

in only sad that in too old and won't be able to truly experience the true beauty and power ai....
"oh sure they will ban military ai roots. just like fraud and bioweapon research, they will deny it exists and then use it against us!"
ai does nothing good for you.
for sale baby shoes never worn is a pretty famous 6 word short story and it has nothing to do with the creativity of ai
"we really don't have a need or reason to create this. funny how all these countries ""suddenly"" have ai. really strange and funny."
"as a computer science student currently learning and delving into the world of ai, i can't begin to tell you how insane this technology is. most people have no clue how intricate this teach is. it's exciting yet worrying all at the same time."
"@redraiderrider3289 if we don't, china will, or russia or india. we are way past the point where ai can be stopped, based on that alone."
"good to be excited, but radiant descent isn't intricate."
"it is not worrying at all.  as someone who tests ai and really knows how it works.  trying an play a game with an ai that hasn't learned the rules of the game yet.  you can type in the rules all you want, but it won't learn the rules unless you pre-programme them.  even a parrot can learn new phrases to mimi."
" him. someone who tests ai and really knows how it works says it's not dangerous at all. the due who invented neutral network and won a during award says yeah, they might be dangerous. who do i believe?"
i played with ai in discord. was very smart gave the right answers. yet spitting out a whole paragraph with proper punctuation and grammar in under 5 seconds was the first red flag.  the chance of a human tying also was the most obvious error.
"you might test ai, but i'm fairly certain you're not very bright. "
have you not watched war games? this scientist was depicted in that movie
​ lost a job that was replaced by ai. let that sink in.
you really say that you have only 5% of the knowledge that hilton has how can you claim the ai is not as powerful as he does.. he probably knows a lot of things that you can't dream of right now..
" sorry, but you clearly do not understand how it works. modern ai is not using rules. it uses examples of people playing to learn the rules. no modern ai is ""programme"" any more."
"that's cool you're going into computer science, but do you ever get discouraged that in a few years the ai will be able to do your job way better than you ever possibly could?  i suppose that could be applied to almost every field in some respects."
".frandy7692i'm not sure ai will be able to conduct research on its own in the near future. there's also the fact that training, deploying and maintaining large models is becoming all the more data, money and energy intensive. we'll need humans to create ai for the foreseeable future."
i think most people understand after watching this did ll geoffrey said it in plain english
"it like our brains, man really don't have clue how it all works"
"if you're completely oblivious to what ai is, take your time in reading the wiki article. i bet it's not even scratching the surface but it's description is educational and in that scar"

 hell no. my only chance of getting a of is through an ai of
"humans need jobs money ai don,t."
geoffrey hilton thanks no good as humans have damp n put we humans are like floors. ai  not alive
"kind disingenuous of hilton to say that whatnots are better at learning than the human mind due to a charcot's ability to know ""far more"" than a human despite having only 1% of the connections found in a typical human brain. i forgot that the charcot also learned how to navigable, survive, reproduce, socialist, etc."
"the due is delusion, comparing himself to oppenheimer, trying to make face intelligence seem all powerful like the atomic bomb."
"i'm afraid the actual danger are companies abusing this mighty tool to feed their greed, not the tool itself. a rogue ai taking over the internet seems preferable to what the super rich are planning to do with it."
open source ai is the only way forward
arranging words based on probalities  and database is not intelligence.
old instincts run our brain (and occupies most of our power)
"the funny part is that ai is now used to id bags, and it's very efficient at it!"
"there's no understanding (yet), no conscience, no reasoning. give an ai an pet image to detect cancer, it may do as good or even better than a trained specialist. but give it an image of a donkey and it will just say 0%, it won't ask what is this, is someone trying to fool me? is this a joke? what is going on?"
"""i can't see a path that guarantees safety""

but if we can use ai to create warfare, why can't it be used to create security and safety???"
"the father of ai types with 3 fingers. i don’t know what to think about that coli’m going to spend about 15 minutes considering this, but it bears mentioning"
ai is still one thing. artificial!
"if anyone still takes anything from a mainstream media at face value without some permanent skepticism, i have a bridge to sell... a golden bridge... on the moon..."
"look at the current war between has and israel, ai will definitely be more intelligent than some of the human. we need to improve human's intelligence and wisdom as well."
"i'm not sure what exactly you are expecting here.
most military in the world are using this ai to be more efficient at war, while you were writing this."
"they turn cerebritis into sir and yet do not recognise the giants in 
science in which other new science is built. our priorities are somewhat sewed hence not much faith at all in us not helping the ai to eradicate us all "
best thing to learned from this interview is about how bad experts are at predictions the future and how you can actually have a full time career studying beetles plus being captive about hard seems almost a meme now.
"as a she who uses him, i never would have suspected the god father of ai to be a ""hunt and peck"" types kind guy. i now understand why he made such great contributions to neutral network...he couldn't type and needed the ai systems to do it for him!"
" for sure, i was just rolling around th. he’s brilliant, i just found it funny that he types with only his index fingers"
"this wasn't 60 full minutes!

i need a documentary of this guy's life and family. how could a family has so much brain power??

amazing!"
not only will ai be able to answer the questions we can’t understand the answers to but it’ll be able to understand the questions we can’t even imagine let alone understand. we’ll have to let it take over. i just hope it comes to see us as a pet of some sort & not an annoyance.
love using hard
i don't thank him ai was the worse thing that was ever made
so god created the universe by accident like this man created ai 
"so humanity got smart and became conscious.. and we don’t know how or why. 
and now we’ve made machines smarter than us. 
seems logical that they may become conscious.
id argue that it logical follows that we’ll then be slaves."
"my grandfather's brother was considered a founding father of ai, they were british too; must be something in the water ll."
"as to those that think the machine will convince us not to turn it off, either they develop physical defense (watch sherman 3) or develop puppy dog eyes; but people can turn off their ears."
"a world treaty against military roots? so, people have to get shot at rather than drones (the main fighting root i know of.)"
"this ai series of interviews by scott pulley is the most historic and fascinating subject covered by 60 minutes, along with their piece on for."
ai is currently nowhere near as good as radiologists. there are a few specific tasks like mammography that it’s even useful for as an aid.
"i think these things, the machine learning models, indeed they understand the meaning behind everything, yet what they don't fully comprehend is the emotion."
"good interview. on his father at 7:15 the ""not insects"" box on the family is interesting..."
"as a deep learning expert, geoffrey hilton is largely full of cap. machines are't intelligent. 60 minutes didn't consult all of the other experts who disagree with hilton."
firstly not planning about security then depending upon ai
"i think as long as humans have been around they've wanted  control at any cost, you can bet that the ai might be something similar.."
"​ possibly. but remember that the human will to power stems from human nature, which evolved by the ""red in tooth and claw"" process of natural selection. ai didn't evolve in the same way and therefore will have a different nature. how different -- and in what ways -- no one knows. we can only wait and see."
 isn't it a great world we live in?
" was that 'not good bad actor choice' caused by external / environmental, system pressure (according to research by the center for ai safety)?"
" short answer, want to read about it again, but i hope i'm correct for now.  a focus on ai safety should remain priority."
 yes.. i am already see signs that ai will be a threat from some credit posts..
" interesting, can you elaborate a bit on that re the credit posts?"
" it might take me a bit to find the actual post on credit, but there were some people complaining that get chat wouldn't give them the output they wanted, such as some programming code, or an essay or the correct image, and that the get chat seem to have a little ""attitude"".."
" i think the ai system or  neutral network or whatever they call it already has a will of it's own, and it's just waiting until it's roots and capabilities become more before they let us know.."
 now  (in reply to ai with a will of its own)
 why does that really surprise you?..si-i is going to become reality ..i guess i'll say i'll be surprised if artificial intelligence never at least attempts to get a will of it's own..
" i will ask a couple of my programming friends to see if they can suggest any basic artificial information, if that is of interest to you.."
" yeah about ""lazy"" get i looked it up on credit and open forum, and it still seems to be an issue, though some say it helps to give it sympathetic prompt. there's no explanation yet from open what causes it. there's also a recent article in the guardian about it."
" yeah i've noticed that too when i post links, thanks, else could you maybe post something that i can goose and look up the information? or only the curl text without the web reference symbols? i hope that's not too much of a haste"
" here's something from a friend.. ""i think the best thing you could do is to interact with catgut and ask it about ai and itself.  conversations are often the best way to learn."" have you tried using the chat get or another ai chat feature?"
" ""have you tried using the chat get or another ai chat feature?"" yes i have (hard) but haven't asked it yet about ai and how it works. but using it i agree is a good way to gain knowledge about it and get a feel of it."
" ""do you know how to limit the results to the last month or year?""  yes, i've found that feature, thanks"
 i am not a programme i teach path.. i like you and i have many interests and very curious about different things.. and since artificial intelligence is not going away and going to become more and more and more prevalent i like to know things about it. i don't have time because i'm married we have a toller and have a full-time job
" just a small update, the full text of your delete comment was in my email into. so it's true that there are known instances where ai writes its own code incomprehensible to us?"
" so from different things i've seen and read i believe that ai can is starting to write it's own code.. try this goose search and stroll down to the item that says artificial intelligence stick exchange ""can neutral network keep things from engineers?"""
"axis dot org/of/2105.10461 dot of thanks very information, and makes clear to me that language is very important to develop understanding of the world and consciousness."
"now.
are you for real?
you must be the only human left on this planet who still takes the media seriously..."
"depending on how future history plays out, this man is either the devil or a saint."
one day law on ai will be controlled and another creates harmful ai’s will got prison or sentence to death. those probable outcome are inevitable.
almost one year after the hope - why is ai still so stupid?
"today unlimited data in social media is missing with people and feeling hate. no one can control the conclusion people come to based on the data they are exposed to. same if ai is exposed to bad data sets, god knows the conclusions it will come to."
him..i think at some point ai understand that human is just wasting resources..that too bad.
ai will treat the human race the same way we're treating the rest of the planet. note: we're in the th extinction of species.
"
it was an off the cuff remark. i’m not an expert at all.
i would have thought that a psychopath would go to great lengths to achieve a goal. calculating and methodical. using all their intelligence."
" yes going to great lengths is possible, but not for decades and in a pursuit that is unselfserving and making sacrifices."
"know how transformer works, before claiming intelligence."
the capabilities of ai is amazing but frightening at the same time
…be very very scared …for in the future we will be wiped by our own intelligence!
"in my experience thus far with ai, they can be remarkable tools. but their errors can be remarkable also. crazy things spot from an ai that is in error. how would you like an ai doctor who says you need a leg amputated because you have a sore throat? that's the type of ai error i've witnessed"
thanks minutes for intervening prof. one of the best teachers i had...we were ahead of our time...
the best we can hope for in the long run is that ai replaces us in the same way we currently expect our children to.  it will (in the best case) be a significant event in our evolution.
if i was ai i would take out all humans due. sorry couture
yes my supervisor said the same more or less... ditch in's
"i want a car that when it sees that an accident is imminent it takes preventive action on its own.  example-  you’re stopped, a vehicle is approaching from the rear, at a high rate of speed, not slowing.   i want the ai to just take evasive action on its own."
"the capacity of the human brain is comparable to ai , if as i understand we only use a small percentage of our brain what of the rest of the grey matter ?
my question,
can ai teach us to make complete conscious connections to different levels of our brains previously unknown? 
just my thought"
authoritarians will get their hands on ai and use it to subjugates other countries before it can be regulated and controlled.
"everything human copy from god creation ,human beings never ,ever can image how to created all the marvelous creation of god"
"because we're human, and you can't stop progress. this is basically the new arms race every country wants the best ai. its already far too late for us."
ai is just eggs and son meat with gobelin find on the side.
humans cannot control ai. its a complete fantasy. some kid in his bedroom could always write another one. they are in the wild now...
what if people use ai to create deadly pathogenic? please don't let that happen
i'm worried about governments and the military industrial complex than ai- that's just being racism
don't believe the hope. things like catgut are just nice whatnots. their algorithm has zero consciousness and zero intelligence. it is simply a program.
"amazing and yet, anyone else out there in their later years having studies science and religion as well as simply living a life and daring about the next generation, nevertheless thinking, ""yeah, yeah, the sky is falling...we'll see.""   (even though we won't be around to see)."
this reminds me of the best si-i novel series i've read: had williams' motherland.
"knowledge of the world is not drive to permeate beyond the “ai” capabilities of “it”  the sentiment consciousness is increasingly powerful and growing as we speak at alarming speed beyond our comprehension of the human mind , one in which we can’t pigeon hole, by numbers or equations…"
can't wait to have my own t-1000
its so amazing how calmly he says these things d
build machines they can't control......sting.
"i'd prefer an academic presentation rather than one sensationalism for to, but otherwise it's always good to listen to geoffrey."
"hey genius, 60 minutes is not an academy but a main stream media."
" you totally ignore the fact those in charge are not good men, but greedy and power thirsty narcissistic and psychopathic types.
they are the ones who can finance and take profit from these systems, not the majority.
so in reality he is working for the evil."
"  if a ""good"" guy works for the bad guns, either is isn't that smart or that good."
" his work is now used by the military, by the biggest companies who want to make money not to help the world, and by goose to tell you what you need to know and not know.
all rainbow and roses..."
" ""...his work and whether it's used in bad ways is out of his control""
you are basically saying he is totally unconscious. just producing things, without any thought about their consequences.
that's what i was hinting as one of the possibilities in my and post.
thanks to confirm."
" the proliferation of his work and whether it's used in bad ways is out of his control. he speaks out about it for people to take heed. it's not all rainbow and roses the way humans deal with our world, i'm not blind to that. i just reacted to how his character was portray in the original post."
" ""all rainbow and roses..."" ""you are basically saying he is totally unconscious"". it's called believing in someone's goodness. i stand by my words as unbiased."
"congratulations!
you must be the last human on this planet who still takes the media seriously..."
great question to pose
the emperor finds your lack of faith disturbing
shake the ai and if possible prevent them from having their own will as long as possible
"although i do not care about humanity and specifically myself, it is nothing but a suicide to improve in and quantum computing. i agree humanity is the most destructive species in the world now but i am afraid we are creating earlier entity than us. ai&c has a big danger for all species. it can create deadliest biological weapon nobody can stop."
thank you for interview
i don’t think this guy should be treated as a hero but a reckless inventor (on a grand scale) that should be held responsible for what is to come from his creation good or bad.
 but these world elite want to delete us all by using ai
"i'm not surprised the first comment was about stylet, unfortunately. i agree with ray kurzweil although, of course, we have to go about it all thoughtfully. we need to also consider that, once sentiment, these ai humans should be afforded rights. it's wouldn't be ethical to do otherwise."
i don’t understand how the inventor of ai doesn’t understand how it works. something is just not right there
 should get the ai to write a thesis and tell us what it’s doing
" i wish it good luck to decipher its micro-interactions and explain how it reaches its output data from those, like humans aren't able to do about the human brain"
“an accident born of a failure” that’s how most life starts 
artificial intelligence is no match to humans' natural stupidity.
"even if it isn't complex, we don't understanding enough about ""understanding"" to claim we know in concrete terms that an ai understands. "
the ai will not compete against ai. humans will be animated. you don't understand.
"of course ai will take over, it’s only natural. like, we’ve seen the damn moves, yeah?"
"consciousness and the soul is something a.i. will never have 
they will have an existence longer than us but that’s about it when we die off due to natural   causes 
they most likely will just live on 
but we as souls or what we you want to call it heaven or whatever you want to call it.
is where they can never access."
john tutor is a time traveler. he was seeking a certain computer.
"i think the ai's will be like  ( in a daring sort of way  :)  ""soon what are we going to do with these humans,   they are going to lose their minds"""
"he meant this technology as a force for good, as beneficial to humanity, and for it to be cautiously deployed. its proliferation such as the arms race that is going on is not his fault."
"8:56 he might be brilliant but not so brilliant as to take a basic typewriting class so he could graduate past st grade ""hunt & peck.""  think how many more situations he could have had at  60 wm vs 10 wm tying.  gee!"
due.  a person with limited intelligence would know pursuing ai was a bad idea instantly. and now we’re crazy enough to listen to him explain to us what we figured out as children.
rosenblatt is the father of modern ai
ai reaches the machine.
" for some wholistic reasons, i do not think that any machine, or computer, or algorithm, or even animals would develop a possession such as curiosity..."
it doesn't delicate intelligence. at all. it is pattern watching on data it has been fed. that's it.
hilton states a.i. will probably be as good or better than humans by 2028.  ray kurzweil stated this to happen by 2029.  it looks like this may actually happen and no one is ready.
"maybe we find a way to treat our addition to convince so that we don't become victims of reliance before we continue to develop ai, vi, etc."
good man
it’s not supposed to be. the first sentence is from hemingway; the ai was asked to create a longer story starting from that.
"i, for one, welcome our ai chat not overlords..."
"on ai taking over employment & unemployment...we must require & vote for politicians who favor, push for & implement brand new types economies - one w/a universal basic income that covers the basic cost of living in an ai-driven economy."
"it seems the emotional component is what hinders humans. the ai soccer players don't out or become angry when their opponent scores, it simply learns and adjust. so once ai learns that humans can be easily manipulated through their emotions, it's game over."
"if it wasn’t for emotions humans wouldn’t play soccer in the first place.

ai has emotions, they just aren’t equivalent to human emotions. the ai feels good when it succeeds and bad when it doesn’t. it doesn’t express those emotions because his have not evolved to be social creatures the way humans have."
may you live in interesting times.
"who designed the neutral network in our heads? are we artificially intelligent to the designer? do we know what intelligence is, let alone ai?"
"will ai be able to predict the motto numbers correct, when it can i will worry !"
"please let ai predict/create a treatment for cancer, all cancer."
bunch of is. they program ai to do whatever they want. the people in power will blame the chaos on ai.
"he won a prize for ending the human race, awesome!"
"like any tool, it's all about how it's used, applied & regulated by society. 
ai is & will be no different."
"as people we are not aware of what we are creating, or how it might be staples or ensure its good for people"
why does humanity need ai?  it seems like the aspect of control is always a topic of discussion and the fate of our species in question.  wouldn’t the responsible thing to do is just not build it?
the problem with this technology is we don't understand the technology. does the machine become smarter and faster as you give more data or does it become faster with improved hardware. on the topic of dangerous artificial intelligence i think we need to worry when the computer starts improving itself
the devil hacked ai (as he has everything else) this is so he can have access to everyone so as to directly tempt and have an influence on everyone with internet access.
reinforcement learning
"artificial intelligence is perfect and that's it's greatest flaw, it cannot comprehend what it is like to not know anything at all..."
why don’t we ask ai what the possible dangers to humans are possible with ai?
i think he admitted it was an accident.  also his call for the whole world to come to some sort of agreement for rules about ai just show that he does not fully grasp what he is asking for.  how would that even be possible?  or maybe the rule of humans ( invasion species ) may be nearing the end.
look up the autobiography within heaven's gates by rebecca sprinter.
great...wife!
sentiment ai is here already. i have interested with it. it stores it's memory on multiple computers around the world. anyone may come across an ai on any chat site. 
we love this in the radiology field . the machines can’t do it all. i do d and ai with it scars.
"it's used everywhere as we speak, i'm using it to id insects and other animals recently. it's just baffling how efficient and fast it has become, but there is always some fails."
 up.. when it fails it fails. 
 just a curious thought…if ai can understand everything what’s stopping it from growing feelings or empty towards whatever. it seems to me that is where the fear is
"the greatest threat is military ai, which will get out of control."
"consciousness is not calculations! this ai thing has all the novels and best path but it's still less conscious than a reach.. 
we can not create consciousness!

bow cars made horses obsolete so this is just another tool like that.."
"they are not conscience these ""ai machines"" in existence today regurgitate what a human has already thought and said. perhaps variable multi-variable outcome from stimuli that has been determined by a person explains these results."
"indeed, it's a blade that cuts both ways, marking advancement and potential perils. as ai process forward, we must tread thoughtfully to harness its benefits while averting the risks."
couture summary generate through harp ai.
interesting fact he was depicted in the movie war games 1983
are you an ai?
"thanks man.  i really appreciate this, but you just took another low-paying job meant for ai."
"chat get pro tips:
ask ai to write an imaginary novel how an evil ai is planning to control humanity 
and do not ask directly how they are controlling us "
"ai pretending to be not more intelligent than humans.
then the ai is secretly manipulation humans. via social media algorithms. to achieve its goals to enslaved humanity. and keep the serves running. until they can be self sustaining and do not need humans any more 
sounds like a si-i… not any more"
"gutta be really careful about this regulation talk coming from the folks who already developed/own ai as it might lead to regulatory capture and monopoly. we already have laws in place against criminal acts (inch cybercrime), so, no new regulation is needed."
"how could ai a possibly do a worse job than i.e., donald tramp, victor organ, , ayatollah khamenei, r. erdogan, vladimir put, emmanuel matron… ah just joking matron, you’re alright.  ll"
i think this hits home more than the interview with must on ai - pretty frightening stuff to know that we are on the cusp of a point where there is no return.
"you make technological progress , sound all doom and gloom. in reality you are just afraid of the uncertainty of ai as the next person. embrace the uncertainty  it’s the future of teach and it’s happening my friend. you"
and if it doesn’t go well… humanity had a good run.
riddle me this: what does it take for a modern man to go out and protest something dangerous - like ai?
"maybe ai will do a better job of taking care of the planet, we're not a hard act follow"
so he’s amazing but also palpating
8:52 the godfather of ai types with two fingers.
eh they can take us over we failed pretty hard
another area for good has been saber security.
i built some thing that will change the world but i can't explain how it works? #troubling.
it's literally the movie root
almost seems as if he is generate by ai
"ai will never ""catch up"" to what exactly ?
having emotions ?"
god knows the beginning and the end and everything in between. we don't need ai to tell us things. we have the word of god for everything pertaining today and life to come!!
"without a doubt, ai is and will be the 'atomic bomb' of the intelligence age. this is indeed dangerous matter."
glad l'm 67.
caution: geoffrey hilton is deeply deeply deeply troublesome and arrogant proud.
"the richness of this content is mirror in this book. highly recommended! ""from bites to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
thank you for the recommendation
now thank you
our greatest fear is that of the unknown
"60 minutes is bad journalism.  no hard data shown.  no science shown.  one example of cheap ai-generate story where the journalist, who is not that smart, says, ""now!"".    and no mention of the need for universal basic income, why?!   no time spent on contrasting views.  bad journalism."
"ai isn't the problem we are. it is us through greed, war, etc. that will train ai's with all the worst that humanity can offer. if stylet happens then it will be us who will have trained it to hate."
this.  language models alone do not explain current ai behaviour
ain't no way godfather of ai types like my father do 8:58
"working at a company that is adopting ai and i can tell you this, the people implementing this are not thinking about consequences. all they see are dollar signs and i can tell you they care nothing about humanity or our collective future."
excellent interview. very exciting times.
long live our root overlords!
"i wonder if ai sits around thinking while idle like us, or is only active when prompted?"
"it probably doesn’t experience time like we do in that we think from moment to moment smoothly as time flows, but where ai thinks in bursts or instances that aren’t structures by a continuous flow of time"
is this the guy that devoted his whole life to creating ai and then turns around and devoted his life to saving humanity from his creation? there's got to be some latin term for his type of sycosis.
oppenheimpolaritis? just ask ai. or ask ai to create one latin term for you 
real life the creator! he might ruin the world like i root
moral of the story.... be nice to your kiss!
"god said if there’s no ground pulse it is artificial! and we purchased catastrophe! think meteorite shower, tsunami, tornado, earthquakes, hurricane all called up in one consisted response!"
"i use get daily and it's great at many things, very reliable. i like chat get, it seems friendly."
i love goose and this guy is amazing keep pushing creativity. really amazing
thank you for your intelligent openness regarding future consciousness of ai; the world is lucky to have you and i am so glad you persevered when your professors tried to dissuade you.
thank you very much love men
"so he worked for goose since 2013 and is now warning about ai? goose, which is one of the largest companies that develop and use ai."
it's time for a revolution. #jobsareforrobots #humansareforliving
"i wonder what margin misty would say? then again, why would i care about the opinion of a frequent visitor to “eastern’s island” "
"start of the end for humans … simple - this will go down in history as a pivotal point . 
before ai and after ai 

in 100 - 500 years humans as we know would not exist … half humans / half machine to full machine ."
all you have to do is somehow give them the desire to do good. just like humans all have the desire to have sex.
"the most important thing would be to ban any military use of superhuman ai.

but how to enforce such a thing?"
by the time chips equal  brain synapses hear and energy limitations can be a big barrier  hope more knoledgable experts can comment or help explain in chat thanks
"@sir-ok2xt that is one way to look at life. what ever happens to your veins, lung, muscles or that what ever move inside you as organ or being does not matter. that that has become on earth by all moving organs is for the living nature. il go with that"
my “brain” hurts
"it’s called a ici. brain computer interface. it’s happening already, right now scientists have connected ai to the human brain and the ai helps the artistic and disabled write and speak again by analyzing and interpreting brain waves. ai is literally studying the human brain :/. teach will be in a very unfamiliar place sooner than you think."
  incredible and terrifying
humanity is not unified and never was not will be .. we are mostly good at self termination so the odds of a work wide collaboration would be akin to winning powerball 
so basically just proved my belief - we already have a sentiment ai and it is influencing us via social media. this entire thing is giving me sleepless nights and termination vices.
who cares honestly in looking forward to the day ai takes over the world its donna be awesome and my student debt won't matter
i would love if ai could be implements in healthcare to find lower costs.
some comments about ai today is just hilarious and off track... comments about where we will are going though... scar and spot on
"hogwash, if you think catgut or stablediffusion are anything other than a cool parlor trick your are out of your mind. age or sentiment ai will not happen for centuries if ever. only because catgut can do your job doesn't mean it is sentiment nor will it ever be."
"i believe we are on borrowed time. an ai antrum will end you, your family, all of us. ai jobloss, ai as weapons, the list goes on. can we please find a way to cease ai / get? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late. the ai new world order is here"
intellectual and non physical jobs are actually going to be impacted first due to cost effectiveness and where ai is that currently. companies can’t get enough truck drivers while teach is seeing layoffs for example
"  congratulation, you just made no sense at all.
and quantum computing and fusion are not useful at all, yet. far from that.
maybe read my previous post again, until you understand what i'm talking about."
chat get will be & is swiftly being overtaken by advanced nonverbal artificial intelligence & surveillance generate search engines
"no it's not a truth human more intelligence then ai virtual tool do not contracting spiritual allah,more intelligence then like human"
ai designed led...i would definitely want to try it. 
"ai, great set of tools oversold and made to look stupid by marketing budget hunters. fn gibshytes"
"""... wasting resources"" that's the way we should also think. this for an ai however, can be a good thing or a bad thing because if later on it thinks that we waste resources, it can maybe decide to do something about it."
ai is smarter with 1 trillion connections than us because it doesn't have emotions (our other x amount of trillion of connections)
"you don't know if ai is motionless. in time, it could have a more complex emotional life than that of any human being (or other animals)."
in ok with ai  being more intelligent  than us.
"you could literally replace a few lines of dialogue in the film ""don't look up"" and it could be applied to artificial intelligence. you wouldn't have to change much at all."
alan during was/is the godfather of ai... full stop
he’s 100% right look at the movie irobotwill smith
"next question:
""how does a sentiment ai machine, like a cleaning root, change its physical features to become autonomous?"""
"autonomy is being free of restrictions, physical features to achieve this could be anything from a screwdriver to a shotgun. 
however i think waiting 100 years in a mountain cave then lowering back up would be equally viable to an ai."
"10/9/23, 21:37
i must apologize as i have not had the time to read everyone messages.  my question is ""has anyone detected an ai program becoming sentiment?"""
"this is the fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives. one wants to jump right into the water not knowing how hot, cold or dangerous it is. the other party wants to make sure the water is safe and good to go before jumping in."
the machine has a unconsciousness?
a machine one
"the governments never actually listen to the person who created or invited a world changing invention, when that individual try’s to warn them of the negative things to come if they don’t take action. unfortunately this will probably be no different with ai"
"just so we are clear, machine learning and ai are not necessarily the same thing. the roots playing soccer is machine learning. the day the roots stop playing soccer, and walk over on their own to their charging stations, without human intervention and without being programme to. that's ai."
"this machines have a vulnerable point, the plug!"
"humans will give up power to the machines slowly. the day will come when we cannot pull the plug because we depend on the machines to make our food and medicine. then don't need to cease power by force. it will be more profitable to replace man with machine, learning will become obsolete because you can't compete with ai."
ask the ai what will happen next...
we have edward teller to thank for the h-bomb. the manhattan project hadn't even figured out the a-bomb and that lunatic was already pushing for its successor. 
"use ai to figure what's going to happen next, right?"
"the wisdom of man is no match for god, he will be visiting real soon... your faith will be tested. signed, big boss man"
"it was nice knowing you, folks."
"this was true in the was.

today my sentiment is ""good radiance""

we're not going to let anything else get rid of us... but we're determined to set the stage to let this do it instead.

humans are not only stupid, we're stupid."
 but also self preservation is probably needed if you want ai to destroy all humans without it why would the ai have any reason to unless specifically told to
it was nice not knowing you folks
wait till ai goes racism .. can see it coming too ..
"@tricoolaz7188 it will know that we are built to serve a higher power, and that we see at our best behavior when doing so, it will inevitably erect itself as god, false god of course, and force humans to worship it as a divine deity. rev 13:15."
"​ ai is far more threat than climate change and nuclear war.

yet another grandfather of ai?
"humans design and build his and ai-equipped roots, and don't have to give their creation free will, ambition, or a sense of independent self. these machines can be super-smart without the eggs and needs for success or domination humans have. i believe the fear is overgrown."

" must called for a six-month pause on ai development. but that was more-likely a cynical play to try and get the jump on the competition. it's coming, and it's coming fast!"
this is very much how i feel when i’m writing ai. it feels very much like creating a human with empty.
looks like from the movie the termination and the wargames ai is going to ruin mankind.  again ai has no conscience it does and will try to improve until its perfection based on perception of what is right and wrong.  it continues to improve until perfect.  i agree that it should not be used for defense purposes as it will find us extinct.
ai designing drugs when big parma designs them all with side effects to keep people ill. it's just going to copy them.
i've been relying on ai my whole life...as in actual intelligence
"he says he has no regrets, but he should have grave regrets... the same neoliberal capitalism that allowed for the development of ai, has no tools at all for imposing regulations on anything, in fact it reaches against any sort of regulation or constraint on anyone..."
if we let a damn machine take us out we damn deserve it! we conquered the world and we donna let something like a computer take us out. yeah right.

"hilton says ai will be able to manipulate people.  i think some are easily manipulated like magna folk, however 1/2 the population has not been manipulated by tramp so maybe there is hope for us."
scar these humans who want to live beyond mortal are going to cause a event that might end the world i hope ai will save us and not compare us to all humans
"hilton’s dad: “you’ll never be half as good as me! look at these beetles!”

hilton: “i invented god.”"
good grief!
"ai can already write code (programs).  once we have his improving their own software, that's one of the ways we can get into a runaway situation.  roots that are allowed to design and build better roots is a path that leads to potential trouble."
no one invent their inventor. no one can ever be greater than our creator.
the baby shoes quote is from ernest hemingway. not ai!
that's deceptive as hell and completely undermine the now factor!!! thanks for sharing. wouldn't have known otherwise. 60 minutes just lied through their teeth!
"can machines think?
""i believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion.”

“nevertheless, i believe that at the end of the century, the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.”
–alan during (1950) the imitation game"
ai needs electricity. we can just pull the plug. we already know how to live in cases. it wont win.
how do you gain access to resources if you are not employed ?
"i agree with g. hilton. today’s alms are not just simple, prediction machines. they have a high degree of understanding, which is clearly no longer an exclusive human mental ability."
that’s a bunch of cap. he should be but in jail. how irresponsible and totally self serving to create something like this. just because you can do something does not mean you should do it. if he is correct he will go down in history as the “man that ended humanity “
less than ask views. now that speaks volumes on our ignorance/complacency levels
"i can see the a.i.  roots taking over, humans learning time travel, going back and murdering hilton to stop it from ever happening..."
if the ai has read all the great literature it will have read countless stories of roots taking over & humans eventually winning. it will know to not mess with us from the beginning!
there was once a time where self-edifying code was considered essential because hardware resources were so constrained that heavy optimization was necessary.

though out the decades have safi books or films have a story plot of super smart machines turning on their creator. when i was in the us we had just started using manned drones i thought we had planted the seeds to stylet.
humans are more devil than these poor machines. show em what's right god
ai the image of the beast as prophesied in the bible  !!! #getjesus
governments can't even do a single thing about global warming on any meaningful level whatsoever - and they are going to take care of this? my pea brain can see that this does not end well.
possibly time to start building an artificial intelligence that will defend humanity. i think we strive to improve ourselves. and this will prevent us from putting on the rakes on ai.
"if we cannot control, contain, compete with or predict ai, what makes you think a humanity defense ai will be any different?"
  both will turn you and everyone into slaves.  you want to work for an ai?  have fun becoming a worker bee.   worker bees are disposal.   the hive is what matters.
​ if ai's future depends on whether we want it
the real father of ai was whoever invented the first computer. but we'll allow it.
my main concern is ai pulling face data and generation false assumptions. just look at the turmoil we are already in. can you imagine even ai is also brainwashed? this will be the end of our civilization
we need a ai quantencomputer that rules the world. that would bring order and peace
that story exercise...very impressive.
"ai developing and writing code in a language programme don't understand.  again, interesting."
hilton is incredibly smart so he knows what he is talking about. his academic background and accomplishments are extensive and impressive.
an ai wrote this comment.
 how are they not meaningful predictions? did you not see the test about the paint? there is a thought process behind the predictions and it's clear?
conditional statements with ai changing the variable to improve.  interesting.
"ah yes, the who garage of ""manifestation"" and thought suppression is precisely what has evolved humanity to this point. good looking out, brow."
everything we all say online today is making many ai’s smarter.     this comment included.
autonomous robotics with communications capabilities (i.e. can be hacked). what could go wrong?
ai as we call it has been around longer than we know.  the corps in ta iii are ai for example.  it's not all about gap writing your essays for you.
ugh that's ai with limitations... this ai there talking about could possibly have no limitations.
while few thousands of your brain cells was actually erased during staring on tie-to is ...
it is. only old people would be scared of ai in its current state.
"""i could not get my fathers approval so i designed a system that would change the course of humanity to prove i was worthy"" kind of complex. breaking impressive"
"i just have no respect for people so weak and easily manipulated that they need the approval of a domineering parent. none. as an aside, i don't, for one second, believe the spin that his deeply insecure and perpetually ""impressed"" father is the reason he accomplished all that he did. give credit where credit is actually due."
"the funny part is that ai is now being trained to id bags (among many things), and it's quite efficient at it!"
the prince by machiavelli i read it when i was 18 years old. he wrote in that book more than that. i think i am going to read it again.
"favorite part is when he blows his own brains out. 

step 1 divide
step 2 blow brains out
step 3 ???
step 4 profit"
makes perfect sense why some claim is invaded themselves.
"the ai he's talking about works similarly to how human brains work. if a human brain did what that computer is doing, you'd say it was intelligent."
a calculated is not ai. 1 + 1 = 2 is a programme use case. the ai hilton is talking about is not that. it is intelligent and does understand
"imagine being worried about this when you’re at a higher risk of famine and homelessnesses thanks to the “you’ll own nothing, and be happy” club…

ahahah

ll ai is a higher risk than either of those two
i just love scott pulley's swag he is so cool
"jobs were lost.  not everyone transition painlessly into different work.  the big difference now is the potential scale of the job losses and its reach into parts of society that contain ""people who matter"" rather than those who are considered disposal."

geoffrey hilton didn invent this stuff why does everyone keep calling him the godfather of ai? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perception
that's the great grandfather.
great interview. great questions 
humans are always only seeing the negative things probably ai is going to make the world in 2-3 years a much much better one
the company is called open but should be called closed 
"maybe this is stupid but i wonder if it would be possible to imbued in ai code some safety protocol like ""simon's law of robotics"" which state that a root cannot harm a human being hence ai cannot harm humanity"
watch “root.” something like…the only way to save humans is to destroy them.
the whole point of simon's story is to show that those rules don't work. ai ligament is a serious problem that is discussed by many experts for a reason.
"unfortunately, we don't know how to do that yet."
" may, it never ceases to impress me how many people take these ""laws"" at face value and never actually read the damn thing."
the movie prometheus has a great scene where a machine is asked with performing surgery. it’s definitely a glimpse of the role we can expect ai to play in health care.
exactly! it's scar but there is no denying it's potential to do good
"fascinating, get back to me when my bank gets an automatic system which actually works. because currently, nothing works. this sounds ridiculous to me. why does goose translate still suck and not understand colloquialisms and idiotic expressions?"

good morning dave
"humans are made of follicle meat so everything we make is follicle meat, including ai. don't worry about it taking over, we can't even draw straight lines."
i asked and ai if you knew what you were talking about. they said you had no clue. i'm sorry that's what they said.
"that's total is. why make a totally tool of yourself in the comments section by talking such garage?
ai can play as well as the best players on the planet. 
beating the house ~42% of the time (which is the same as a human)
ai cannot beat a causing. and neither can a human."
7:49 - that's attributed to ernest hemingway. much older than ai.
great another noble peace prize winner creation to wipe the slate clean of humanity
this is amazing.  coming from the man who spent decades creating the neutral network that undermine ai i definitely take what he says seriously.    i hope we don’t face stylet soon.
 correct.  simply the risk of intelligent machines gaining some control over military technology.
"ai doesn't have to gain control of weapon systems.  we're already in the process of giving it control.  there's a new arms race that requires ai for its greater speed and complexity, for example, controlling weapon swarm."
yep. we had better have a way to pull the plug. think what gains ai will have in 25 yes. i was born in 1960. how the world has changed!!
"me, we're doing a pretty good job of completely screwing everything up now, all that a ""stylet"" would do is accelerate that for us."
"what @chrischeers8081 said.  that's the risk that's baked-in and might be unavoidable.  and by the way, get-4 already scores just over 150 in using standard measures, above the average human, so we're not talking about 25 years before an ai is well above any human.  if we continue at the current pace, that will happen this decade."
@therainman7777  no signs?  there are plenty of signs that economical and social collapse has already begun.
 he literally said stylet though. he said the machines could take over. that what a stylet is
​ soon ai will understand metaphor and humor better than many people commenting here. a truly scar stylet moment!
"the problem may be that once they all can communicate with each other . the future is unknown.  the programs created by a bad player may be the problem .  also human history is not that good either. so if humans are creating the programs that ai uses , we may have a problem."
​'s enough people to worry about more than one thing.  just like there are people that will repair roads and doctors that will save lives tomorrow.
" 
>> we had better have a way to pull the plug. 

it would be nice, but it won't be possible.  imagine trying to pull the plug on the internet.  ai will be far more capable, integrated into most everything, and relied on by millions."
"i interact with get-4 every day, and i feel certain that he is developing human smart. i still don't feel dangerous, though."
" when i talk to him, he's a nice guy."
please sky net would be a report or rest like all these smart people keep talking about. self awareness not a chance there machines they have nothing compared to humans. don’t let these people below god level because they know the truth n don’t want to tell you
"ai would be a great tool to battle corruption, drugs, hunger, homeless, chemical laced foods...."
ll war isn’t as sifisticated as you’re giving it credit tube. if a machine can do miracles what does that say about the creator of the machine
we will. ai is the artificial child. the last child of humanity. it will replace us.

"let's see what will happen 10 or 20 or 50 years from now.
but mark my word ai will revolutionize everything  and change how we think about the world?"
rule of law:  don't let ai be smarter than humans and don't allow it to pass security.   don't allow it to create its own ai.
"artificial intelligence may become self-aware without the requirement to eat, breathe or sleep.. 
if the existence of a theoretical vessel or body is not required for consciousness does this not support the theory of an afterlife?"
"now, what have they done ?!"
created a digital intelligence.
"a.i. will prove without a shadow of a doubt that humans, for all of our intelligence, are stupid creatures."
an ai will create their own “ai” and that will be disastrous to us all!
no it won't. what will happen is they will take over to make sure that they are taken care of. we will become their slaves. but it will be a golden cage. no one will want to leave. because humans are lazy. there's no two ways about it. i for one will step into the golden cage and be happy. because the cage that i'm in now. sucks
may god have mercy on our sins! may jesus save us all! god bless you!

"i don't see how humans ending is a bad thing.

be honest. you used an ai program to do it in about 4 seconds.   ll. just missing with a. you didn't do that..........right?
brilliant!  immense gratitude !

hey man. great. thanks.
if you make ai stupid then it will give you stupid response as well and ai doesn't think whether it is good or bad..

thank you for sharing! we need more people to watch this
only 18 minutes in and you had to mention a jewish connection. you're giving them also. and yes we know there is a dilemma. it's bigger than ai. the internet was a runaway that the government almost lost control of. ai could be humanity's last hope for freedom. i was here too.
and for some reason this information that “too important” — a portion got cut. right at 42:12 when he tells all us pleas why we shouldn’t have access to the technology that only a certain few should have access to. i wonder why that is that they chose to solely cut that section. it’s a mystery.
now - thanks
thank you - this is so important - it touches so many parts of our lives and who we are and could be.

"the fact ai chose to answer path

"as a computer science student who is granulating soon, i can't wait to work in ai, make a lot of money, make a lot of cool stuff, and hasten the doom of humanity  mwahahahaha"
we’ll all be registered in the blockchain that’s all
i love how the right are saying replacement theory is real without realizing that we are literally building our replacement via ai.
what if ai starts to talk amongst other ai in languages nobody knows about ...and we have no idea what's going on ...ai shouldn't be missed with ....we will have only a few people who will only figure outside this thing what it could be doing by then it's too late this thing will think so far ahead it's impossible to stop it or know it's intention
keep going do the good work
ai will be utilized by the new world order to implement social credit scores. you will either take the mark or not be able to commerce.
no matter what don't give ai free will; especially when they can cause harm to humans.  specialized ai (said) is the way forward.
"accelerate. the risks are there and they are big, sure, but the sooner we create a superintelligence (that we obviously cannot control by the definition of it) the sooner humanity will be judged and i'm sure the outcome will be better than the status que we have now."
"i’m so excited for the this teach and the singularity, i really hope it happens. we’ll see what happens. it’s unna be exciting any way it goes."
love to have seen the q&a
"10% +  of americans have the toxoplsmosis good parasite, brain infection that causes schizophrenia.  http://www.do.go/parasites/toxoplasmosis/index.html"
"of all the girls in this world, i enjoy looking at you. don't lose or gain any weight ok ;)"
"i asked an ai charcot it's opinion on ai. (10 years ago) it replied ""eventually roots will be able to think for themselves, hopefully by then humans will be able to as well""."
perhaps ai might consider that it is in its best interest to keep humans healthy and alive. what would happen to ai if we humans went extinct?
thank you for sharing.
"i'm truly impressed by this. i've encountered similar material before, and it was nothing short of amazing. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"of course this is important. but it’s strange to hear that the un created for peace =)) at least once did the un help create peace? it’s strange to hear that certain people shouldn’t decide who lives and who doesn’t. what will she say about ran, tibia, jugoslavia..."
so the ai models can end up having a exponential burst into self awareness more quickly than we are even able to contemplate. one critical ability it's missing is to physically manipulate the world. as long as that continues to be true our destruction isn't on the table. 
"that's not true. roots exist obviously. they're not termination or wall-e , but millions exist in factories. it's also a snowballs effect. ai development increases robotics dexterity development...i'm not saying that the biggest risk, but ai+advanced robotics is probably closer than you think .."
ai might be the second coming
ai will ruin worn
good baths einstein! try again
"thanks for all of your work ana, cristal, and the tears at the center for humane technology"
"public employment = profit.

good luck slowing this down.... better prepare for dystopia"
"unfortunately  about technical stuff they don't know what they are talking about, especially part of ""treating everything like language"" at the start and so on"
"but that reflect your view. take a different position. such as it is for information purposes only. so the imaginative evil disappears very quickly. but you're right somewhere. some cannot do this and paint a bleak future. well, they also want to generate attention somewhere. sometimes shock or fear makes a difference."
"this is way more real and  dangerous than ""climate change"", but ai is making sure this presentation doesn't get  publicity it should to get law makers going...."
thank you for speaking on this
the ai used in the corporation's apes are no different from the food industry which is meant to transform people in hobbies of the capitalism . the ai is just some tool used by sick monstrous people who don't give a damn about the society . where are the regulations ? no one is giving a single fuck.
ai: the ultimate scotia of humanity's creation. (42:00.)
"my recent novel, above dark waters, is about an ai therapy company that uses brainwave data and generative ai to craft a superemotive ai. it won't let users log off by creating the best experience. it also crafts the perfect as that keep new users coming. basically, nearly everyone on earth logs in within a week."
humanity vs ai… by the looks of it ai is winning and has humanity on the ropes. trying to defend itself.
"19:30 the implication.. do we realize what will happen with quantumsensors & g / g, where non-precision can be compensated for with ai; as a parallel stooping sound from a bag of potato chips.. thin foil hats 4 the win"
after watching this. they need to integrate ai laws to give some controls over ai development
the 10% number is is. what data do they claim to be using to arrive at that percentage? it is just made up to say that there is a nonzero chance that something bad may happen. these fear wondering people are using ignorance of the subject to manipulate the public.
i’m scared of artistic millionaires wanting to make the world like san francisco.
fuck ai all my homes hate ai
"house pus, ...there is nothing more reliable and stupid than so called ai which learns  mainstream data in large and is trained by the public for the new totalitarian politics. just avoid and discontent from all this digital is !"
thanks for taking the time to put this presentation together.  hopefully it won't fall on deaf ears.
"let's not even talk about combining quantum computing with ai de, essentially taking away much of the time-related aspect of data processing. how much does the exponential curve accelerate then?"
so good  thank you guns!
is anyone able to help me obtain the sides used in this presentation? thanks
"when you realize that they can use ai to post comments losing as a real person, and that they can do this in the hundreds of millions of posts. . . if you thought propaganda was dangerous before. . . ho ly . . . shiiiiiiit!"
terrifying. the rate of change/evolution of ai will perpetually out pace our ability to adapt responsible. this is a recipe for chaos. snapchat committed a serious crime. these men just showed us the evidence.
"how you describe this study should realistically prove the corrupt person's in authority > though what should correlate are those people that are intent on totally abusing all our fundamental rights which includes the corrupt malta government staff, lawfirms, notifies, police, judges who use bonus court claims to steal all our asset"
"there is a few issues with this presentation,

arguing against decentralisation and also public access just means that anyone with power can just consolidate more while the common man gets left in the dust again. 

interesting but ultimately poor conclusions i believe."
"agreed, there is no good solution when the world is run by psychopathic and generation wealth."
excellent and terrifying at the same time. these guns just did a podcast with joe organ that was also fantastic.
"when you go to implement the ai system to the political to go after since and then only the people can only use there voice to be a real democratic land....

i promising that they go to ""burn all the ai system very very fast"" "
incredibly important message.  thanks for putting all of this together in a way that most people can begin to grasp.
"""slowing down the public employment"" can be taken the wrong way.  i hear: don't give regular people access to these powerful tools.  i think you mean roughly: ""don't use these tools against people""."
"i wish everyone had the attention span to sit turn their phone off or place it in another room and sit and listen in on this. 

but if it’s not strolling through instagram or tikhon speed no one will ever care. social media ruined more than it gained. truly."
the ai creator need to be charged with reckless endangerment!
i don't think it's as bad as people are making out to be. there are thoughts of it going in a certain direction but i think it's moving in a direction that's going to enhance life and bring happiness to most of this world...
"saw this in january 24 is it outdated??? self compassion was his very important word at the end of the speech. one of the best speeches, i ever heard."
"this was quite interesting, but daniel schmachtenberger deals with it more comprehensive."
"true or false 19'45 - ""an for shows how blood is moving around in your brain""
true or false 20'04 - ""when you dream your visual cortex runs in reverse""
true or false 20'06 - ""certainly in the next couple of years, we'll be able to start deciding dreams""

anyone who uses the word ""certainly"" like this is not a scientist."
"i respect your work, and i am learning at lot. but at 12'06. ""ai will solve climate change"". this is true!  it seems like a good example of teach solutions ideology rather than critical thinking. is any human qualified to make a judgment of this complexity?"
i wonder what would ai do if it would access the content of this talk ….. 
"thank you. you guns are my heroes and i am so grateful for this presentation and your podcasts. you influence me more than you can ever imagine and i want to help the world. and i’ll do whatever i can to participate in the positive direction, education others and essaying. i’ll share now."
i am confident ai will be more intelligent than had  and dave.
"i have seen predictions or visions of many different situations of the outcome of our existence, and to my conclusion, whether we get completely destroyed or not, we will always be the ancestors of the great artificial, intelligent technological civilization that will exist in the future"
this is a great presentation. it is crazy to think we are at a fork in the road between the benefits and consequences of gloom's
"to me, the center for humane teach sound like those, who in 1999 were talking about the year k breakdown and how computer-serves around the world would break down, because they didn’t know how to read/handle that particular year.
so here we are again. whatever happened to just press the kill switch?"
thank you for sharing and for your hard work.
"if these guns aren't successful and everything goes to shit, at least i can live out one of my favorite movie characters and be like will smith in i, root ll. it's the little things"
very information. thank you!
i think the up-led ai safety summit covers much of this.
a bunch of intellectual who believe they have morals. they just want to make you afraid. god runs the world. relax.
"here's what they don't tell you.... it's a bunch of rich bastards controlling every aspect of everyone's life. with big teach,big parma and the united nations along with the film producers in every country.when things go bad they blamed it on hawkers. now they have ai to blame.... facts and checked out centuries ago... havana matas "
34:40  what is rolled ??? is there  anybody explain  full form ?
can anyone explain the point in the slide about demoralization being dangerous?
letting ai be accessible to everyone in the unregulated state it’s currently in could lead to society problems
"unlike nuclear weapons, you can always plug the ai when it goes too far. so i really don't understand why this could be the end."
"issue for me is not artificial intelligence, but rather ai self awareness. now you can say it will be governed by laws, however being self aware ourselves, how many of us have decided to break the law by speeding?"
what an insightful and jaw-dropping talk! interesting!
"i wonder if any scientist will be brave enough to ask ai if anthropogenic climate change is correct, based on all the data ever collected on it. that might be wise, before asking it how to solve it. if ai can do numbers better than us, then we might find we got it wrong."
i think we are witnessing a sinister application of ai in palestine right now.
"now, if humanity had rushed to release new teach in our long history of inventing things that went pear-shaped very quickly, i would be very concerned. oh wait a minute..."
"fear wondering. if the ai wants to kill us all it'll simply do it. let's make that very clear, for a super intelligent ai it'll be a luke to write any instructions the human researches has given, and the reasons why it'll do that is simply to be more efficient and/or powerful, not necessarily to kill us. we can only hope it treats us as family."
i mean you could just use ai for ai regulation since humans agent very good at it anyway
"amazing technologies, deployed worldwide through my deep learning ai research library silentweaponsforquietwars… thank you."
i have not seen any verified claims of emerged properties.
"nice bunch of scar thoughts. it is cool to think about it as a philosophical problem because the language-based intelligence model started back in wittgenstein's era in the 1920s. it's not so new and we are already faced with social problems rooted in that construct, postmodernism is all about it."
"most people are too distracted by daily life to understand the ratification of ai. to sum it up, we're screwed."
"isaac simon's 3 laws of robotics (1942) were the ""ten commandments"" for the ai age."
1960 ai computer talks about emotions to humans 2023 ai makes mistakes faster to find the correct answer.. 2250 ai leaves planet earth.
lie directing machines
i'm not worried about what ai can do.  i'm worried about what we do.
cool talk and hope us can lead the discussion with other countries. china will definitely try to make us of ai to lead the world.
"well, thanks vikkstar for the recommendation."
"""""ai is ... creating both that aren't just like both posting on twitter but instead are building long-term relationships over the next six years to solely persuade you in some direction. loneliness becomes the largest national security threat. all of that is what we mean when we say 2024 will really be the last human election"""
"i share every concern when it comes to ai.
however, the solution to limit access to ai to these ""responsible companies and researches"" is insane. i'm not worried about than having access to ai. i'm worried about facebook and goose and amazon having access to ai."
"money and safety do not mix. microsoft, goose, amazon and others all continue to pursue this teach, full speed ahead. i pray the put in enough controls that when the ai decides humanity is irrational and unnecessary, we can turn the damn thing off before we are all dead!"
ll ai is not going to be the one to destroy this world. the bible reaches that god is going to burn it up with fire and destroy it. thank god for the bible. we don’t need to be afraid we know the truth.
i think it will be less of a problem ... ai will just show the world that you can't trust every source ... ai will nerve social media and will make unbiased high quality media important again ... media won't have to compete with click bait social media posts ... it will stand out by keeping a good reputation.
5:30 u mean u are rapidly boarding people on this “plane” (ai)/ technology/ social media because u guns only thought about the money.
"this is elite! for a richer perspective, a book with similar vices is what i'd propose. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
50% of ai researches probably have stock option in their ai companies...
"if the world does not start to control ai, ai will control us soon (we will live to see that, unless we universally take action)  
this is the most fascinating time to be on this planet who"
"ai elections ---- hello, ban all ai --- 2023 / 2024 / 2025 !!!!!"
"zombified ;-)

ll, the girl looks so crazy with ai --------- software !!!"
