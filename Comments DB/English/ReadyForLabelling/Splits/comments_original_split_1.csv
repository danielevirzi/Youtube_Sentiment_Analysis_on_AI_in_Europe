"i appreciate what these guns are doing, but i can’t help feeling that these problems won’t affect everyone in society equally- it seems as if the first people to be affected will be those most invested in traditional means of economy and exploitation, in the elite in the global north (just look at the people in the crowd)"
"so you argue for monopolized it to a few selected companies... that has always been a good idea. and on top of it you argue to somehow limit the access to path, research and computer code?"
"i was wondering when someone would start using ai to try deciding animal communication, i'm glad to hear that research is being done."
what's scar is that (i love the educated) guess who
what happens when ai transcend human intelligence ? they dont need food water air nor shelter. what will their motivation be then ?!
"i've tried to spread the word, no success.  i've tried to spread the word on several things, no success.  most of my friends have degrees, several have masters, and multiple degrees, and i can't get through to any of them.   i guess have a good day folks and i'll see you in hell"
the secret one world government is in control of the artificial intelligence– do not trust it.
do not fear. age is here to help people grow up and transcend to other super human tasks.
this was in march 2023...where are we today in sept 2023? we already seem to be acclimated to the world of ai
"using his states 50% of ai researches say 10% ai will cause human extinction == 95% we don't go extinct, allow for margin of error. the states are we live, not bad. we have a higher chance of dying in our car, or food causing us harm. ai can also help us find solutions to complex problems. i like ai."
did no one read or see the movie about ai? giving control of you daily life to a machine or machines is asking for your to become obsolete!
"only after we create a perfect tool to control others, we understand that we are the others to... the same way that we have create a weapon that can destroy a country and we understand that we have a country to defend now we try to eradicate that weapon."
"""with great power comes great responsibility."""
what would an ai feel responsible for if it had the great power? the removal of potential chemical based bigotry might not arrive at the same conclusions that flesh does
how to get the benefits that ai supposedly gives us while avoiding the downsides of it. literally don''t program ai and start using our natural intelligence outside our plastic mass that we got enamoured with ak the brain :)
nice chairs.
seems hard to explain
cristal and the not 'ana' give a remarkable lecture!
all b.s. ai will create more jobs than it will remove from the economy. not to mention that as long as liberals run the world labor unions will always be here to create more jobs and the deep state will always be here to create more big government jobs.
soon ai can detect cheating partner. can't wait
48:01 *when woke silicon valley trains your a.i.*
"33:22 *if the history of successful cultures is anything to go by: teach it the best set of values, morals, and ethics that you can (and live up to that same scheme yourself as to not be a hypocrite in their ""eyes."")...*

we're so tucked..."
"we don't need an elite vanguard to gatekeep teach. doing so consolidated power which makes it vulnerable to ideological capture. just like guns in the hands of the populace acts as a check to government, so does ai in the hands of the commoner"
which field of study is currently and will be in the future most needed in regards to this topic? thank you.
"don't hold back, we need real ai to free us!"
the great benefit of nihilism is that i in no way fear ai. if it wiped out humanity....oh well.
"so artificial intelligence is the most fraudulent form of activity possible .
oh, doorway you've read my post"
"ll, can't wait for more open source models come out then~"
are 50% of a.i. researcher actively making the ai technologies we speak of? who are these a.i. researches? the plane analogy seems a little off?
it should to be a crime to use deep faces with long yes in jail.
"ai is the modern day wizard of oz. it won't think anything but human error could cause chaos but, otherwise, it's canned response and ""an educated inference"" - as described by chatgpt4"
"basically, i begin to suspect that ai  will be.our genesis, precisely at the point of view, we had decided to stay blind. that we are a virus for environment and we are in an absolute denial to consider it. so the way we have set the ai is an alias of our so obvious hidden behavior against other species."
can ai be as spontaneous as a to game host personality. or a social media influence without programming influence? i don't mean pre program and learning as they go. i'm talking about spontaneous thinking of the top of their heads like stand up comic with out any programming influence.
"17:31 that what his do: they take some input node, traverse a graph reorganized the weights and generate an output. but it does not mean, that a language model can convert any image to program any root whit catgut. often its not even clear if an ai will do the job better than a handcoded program"
"oh man was this produced by the crabpeople, or do you even know what ai is and how it works?hata they even think they know his better than anybody else and give names to them. but yea: children will have no identity, ai will kill us all, and it will discover that earth isn flat...."
the day after is why we don't have more nuclear power plants. we want eve ... we don't have a grid that can support them. i don't think this is a good example.
"starts out with a big fat lie. goose: no, 50% of ai researches don't believe there is a 10% risk that ai will kill us"
"hello sir , i want your help. i am a student of briton college. i want to request for your of on this presentation so we can spread awareness about learning speed of ai and we as a young generation can be aware of ai dilemma. i really appreciate your presentation on social dilemma and ai dilemma . hope you will cooperate soon."
build ai to uphold the constitution problem solved
"now,,  that was a great talk"
the face climate change garage.  blame the ones who created ai
"what happened when these ""holmes"" were ask to create a ""during"" test that ai can't pass???"
"the information is just a series of codes and languages in the matrix. 
the interfere is very interesting ."
people laughing when shown stuff like ai being okay with pedophilia is pretty disturbing.
holy fuck this is amazing.
"i love how they carefully avoid to talk about the root problem of all they presented : 
capitalism !"
"its not the artificial intelligence that worries me. it is the fact that a corrupt government can do just as they have with social media, command the developer and programme to work for them. now we will have a weaponized artificial intelligence. hacking and hemp weapons will be the only chance we have."
"i think at the very least for now we could not buy into the casual normalization and tends and have these conversations in our own specific fields. (i myself am interested in art for example, so i constantly witness and partake in conversations about ai art.)"
the us and china are already designing ai swarm drone technologies for their respective militarist. humanity is doomed.
"the is zero option to control ai,  the western world is in an ai arms race against the chinese and russians. the parties who lead will dominate the others on the battlefield and economically."
yes! let's make the first thing we do with ai is make it kill a lot of people. 
"hey guns, the world is warming up. we need to do something about it. loops, now it’s too late. 
hey guns, we need to get ahead of ai, loops, too late."
the real purpose of ai is to prove that god creation is failure if ai apply in religious practice in industries no problem it's good!more than that?it to dangerous it can result into normal human extinction but god jesus not allow to that!
the chaos of ai if use in war machines and religions and so for a person's or human roots that integrate  in social interaction with humans in same laws apply to them!what i mean if you killed humanoid roots in society  same laws apply with normal human!
ai is going to destroy us socially before it’s ever a physical threat.
"now, wonder where r we headed to with these kind of advancement in ai development?. there will b a paradise shift of what we know as life. will it b a utopian world where v wish and things start appearing boy of ai or dystopian world where we are extinct. one god thing is i can see the result for myself in my lifetime."
"impressive talk, thanks for sharing this"
they lost control of ai for good! all companies will rush to make as much money as possible! the singularity will happen very soon!
ai is very dangerous and should be banner worldwide.
"the ai dilemma is ai was developed decades ago and is already out of control.  ai is running the  show we all have to live in now. notice all the experts calling for reducing the population of the world aren't willing to lead by example by reducing their own personal population, immediately."
"great presentation guns. thanks for this, it really opens the eyes and makes you think."
50% of ai researches are suffers. ai can't even spell words when it prints graphics. 50% of ai researches are trying to scare policy makers into subsiding their large data obligations.
ai should be scared of humans
in more scared of humans than ai
"""we can still choose""....yeah, just like we did for global warming ll. we can't anticipate consequences until we're neck deep in them. with ai, by the time we realize our feet are getting wet, we'll  be leagues under an exponentially rising sea."
"they may be picking out random subjects to gather their knowledge. it's perilous.
sane or insane is a razor's edge. what is creep is ai's paintings, like van go..."
why don’t you ask ai how to control its power and avoid all the bad things that you just mentioned ? i’m very curious what the answer will be.
"stop those idiot 
don’t make dumb mistakes again.
don't give roots free will.
you will cause the death of mankind."
"ai has been manipulation humanity for at least 5 years already, probably longer"
"superb presentation, folks: good job !!"
"""innocuous"" !?  to say ""they"" did not know or have any understanding that ai would be harmful ...or pardon mi, i meant ""innocuous"" is is!!"
"everyone needs to plug, after downloading everything about  #homesteading #rejuvenation agriculture  #harvesting the rain #
# ruuuun away  #off grid said  #eye2eye"
"excluding the latent american propaganda, nice presentation."
"concerning the idea: ""you can tread everything as language""... do you know w.v.o.quires indeterminacy of translation?
or the failure of logical positivism?"
"sir,
it will be better to have a thumbnail tittle *the death of ai, than it is posted now."
"ai has been around for a long time, it’s called mainstream media"
ai is writing it’s own code exponentially- bu don’t worry china’s ai won’t be able to do that  i’m looking for the update baths later…
http://couture.com/@akinfi-boris
always the nay sobs. intelligence promotes life unlike some species 
i delete my facebook account recently... because it now gives me nightmare! even it's founder looks like a root!
china will collapse first from a lack of trust bc of ai.  russia will collapse next. only the us has a chance of not collapsing from ai and the lack of society trust in everything.
"e' finite per vol.  not lavoriamo, costruiamo come fisiche, trasportiamo, viviamo penza un computer , coltiviamo, i spostiamo a died, non abbiamo bisogno di social,  ai and  whatever  . si china decrescita,  dovreste gin' saperlo"
is there an going ai race? who's winning?
ai song : circle of hell ai
the ai technology
"thank you for sharing, education is important on ai & continuous education. 

i hope you think about adding subtitles to reach the masses."
god bless you !
if ai has all the facts about children and sex and laws and it behaves as shown here then it is utterly reliable and useless
"there is no ai.  all the examples they give are actually the result of some humans working very hard in the background.  but ""teach ethicists"" don't know anything about work so they assume it's magic and call it ai."
"it isn't fear wondering.  the concerns are real and the timing is extremely hard to predict.

the guy who spearheaded the ai pause letter is max remark at it.  what does remark have to gain by being publicly painted as a fear-mongrel?  the university at the center of new emerging teach."
i've thought for a while that technology is ruining the world. how fitting that it will totally ruin it.  everything i own sucks up or breaks so ai will too
surprised dan brown's 'origin' wasn't mentioned a wicked read and a fascinating twist about religion and ai.
"i am and always have been for progress that helps humanity, but what is happening right now with ai development seems uncontrollable. there is an urgent task in here, or great harm may be done. center of human technology does a great job to raise awareness."
could we code an ai to be in charge of ai safety ?
kill our ai are has it under control. why worry ha ha ha.  we don't get along or agree on what to do to stop ai be prepared to survive it.
http://bittspo.blogspot.com/2023/07/the-calculated-dilemma-ai-dilemma.html
"how do to know you are being ""artificially intelligent"" any suggestions?"
the time is now. the heads of representatives in the world need to get together and come to an agreement about ai
"if we don't come together to control ai, we will see the rise of the antichrist in our lifetime."
we are basically summoning the demon. please control this ai before it's too late
the point is for you to be afraid. jesus won. be joyful.
if you need great technology to destroy an oncoming extraterrestrial race chances are you will be in a losing war since they have prove to have greater technology then people with lesser technical civilization as they have technology to get here from a far off place that they come from.
"all high teach races are doomed to destroy themselves through hatred combined with high or low technology. it becomes much easier to destroy in greater numbers when the technology becomes greater such as going from bullets to nuclear bombs.
by"
"airplane used as flying bombs, killer roots coming, guns used to kill animals for food now used to shoot people. so many technologies used against us. few built in fail safes."
"the a i dilemma will begin by hawkers  make a i and or a i with humanoid roots go against us.

by"
there was not any single good use of the atomic bomb.
the militarist always wants to turn potentially good things or achievements into a weapons system.
what i'm hearing is they want to gatekeep it and profit. the whole reason open was created was to get a rapidly developing technology into as many hands as possible so that it wouldn't be monopolized by a single group.
why not teach the ai to self regulate using moral and ethical codes
"i would suspect ai is physically centralized in various locations as seen on 60 minutes. could their serves simply be turned off if need be? will ai know that, especially since i am now writing about it? lastly could ai as a defensive measure go rough and commit subside once humanity depends on it?"
i'm not scared when thirty ted talk salesman try to feed me the newest bullshit it isn't sentiment it won't be sentiment it is machine learning and it isn't new and it isn't scar. the people programming and training it are the scar ones
basically we are now playing catch up with ai…
9:56 art  isn ai made
i dont fear ai or the bomb or climate change or social collapse. why should i. is there reason to fear? yes sure. but is it helping in anyway? no. overcome the fear. clear the head and take on the task. 
"i really liked ""the social dilemma"" as it was backed by data but this is way too doom. take a breath  the talk is based purely on emotion and wild pessimistic theories about what might happen the future. but hey for people outside of ai, who have never heard of the brain wave prediction thing and so on, this talk must have been mind-blowing.."
"imagine a world where the millionaires developing ai are better people ... everyone would have healthcare, better government ... we could end poverty and hopelessness."
"can anybody tell me how training on synthesis data won't turn a ll, and the entire internet for that sake, into a hallucinations autonomous mess that becomes useless because it exponentially simplifies the flaws and made up data that it produces as it keeps building on itself?"
"that sounds very much like sycosis, or doesn't it? i left my hot take on that in a recent comment but i keep thinking that the mechanics (for lack of a better word now) of gully ai strike me very much as a personality disordered mirror of our own mind(s)."
a i is humans (quinine idiot) / the pope / the sides / tramp / the clinton / put / selensky/ must / black rock / gates / wiser / jeff bone & others . we could ask the logarithms (r i) to monitor the thieves who control our ponies . the lips law end corruption!
"consequences of greed, hate and division. enjoy!"
"but dukes are specifically weapons, and ai is not that unless trained so.. the correlation is not sound.

further, ""ligament"" is a kind of slavery. you have to lobotomize your construct to keep it trained. sentiment, it already is... salient would be better, not worse."
ohhhhhh lord sooooooo spectacular
"unfortunately, while we slow things down, china has the pedal to the metal.  we can't afford to slow down."
"what really annoy me about this is the obvious unknowns and fear of where the future ai is heading, yet we are just tucking right along with it. everyone responsible for ai needs to come to a mutual agreement to stop."
"it seems like the oceangate sub is a perfect symbol of the new trend in technology safety, we are facing the same outcome with ai if nothing changes quick."
"before smartphone (apple,andros,etc) take the first step, many result could be good or bad for next generation. and the result as u can see 'gen z is a first wave, now second wave is coming "
don't forget there's still a world office. get out there and enjoy it whilst you can.
i wouldn't go by hawaii to be honest. he isn't an academic in the strict sense. he is more a popular science guy. in fairness if you look up any expertise on ai it won't include hawaii.
"but all of that is only feasible because we've adopted to the medium through which ai can influence us. neo luddism is coming.

private company cos are behold to the shareholder, they can't be trusted to make the most rational decision for society as a whole."
that's good!
we got to see this masterpiece begun u shared. 
"why can't we ask ai how to solve those loopholes, or how to write a law that will really avoid problems. ai can generate adequate answers or not?"
ai can't whip so they don't have a 1% chance :)
the ai can just be as dangerous or as useful as we humans influence them ..
i paid for one of the image creation things. i asked it to make me a picture of beethoven listening to headphones riding a unicorn. i was actually pretty disappointed and impressed.
let's hope we miraculous use ai to find solutions to problems like diseases and not to earn more and fight others.
"apparently people are not very scared of possible catastrophe outcome. just as it's happening with climate change, money and interest always win and same will happen with ai. nonetheless, thanks for sharing this important panel"
doesn't it seem psychic that none of the presidential candidates have even mentioned this in their campaign???????????
"the best argument i've heard is, what data do you present the ai. limit its scope to military use and see what future we get. unfortunately, the research being publicly available offers a better outcome, but maybe restricting ""employment"" makes sense, as the speakers recommend."
56:01 imagine running a panel on ai safety and henry “the forest jump of war crimes” kissing is there
halt ai research now!! before its too late
"by 22:35 why have these technologies not been implements into assisting fully/partially blind individuals in that the ai/code could fill in the ‘banks’ in sight.

perhaps i’m naive and asking a stupid question but thought i would ask nonetheless"
time to move to the woods until some robotic dog shows up to take me to the ''humanoid data set''
"man up to this point i was excited for neuralink, now i dont want anything teach related near my brain. and to be honest, i've always thought of social media as the biggest mistake (i'm <25) and it had a huge negative impact on my life. wish not everything was an arms race"
"to;dr ""we need to do what china is doing, and censor the public. keep this technology out of the hands of the people. use ai to perpetuate governmental systems of oppression."" fuck goose"
"this ai roylott is not happenstance in it's timing. these hills are closing the water, as they know these powerful tools available to all, will truly democratic thought! gatekeeper's much? i can hear it in your  breath."
"in cool with human extinction, nothing lasts forever, i have pretty much accepted that ai will be the next form of ""human"" evolution."
one question: how are humans able to call themselves ai experts? because this amazing presentation tells us that ai is able to teach itself skill in a better way than human possible. (just food for thought)
now i can believe this was written by ai. scar!
holy shit...so that scene in batman: the dark knight where they used every phone in the city as echolocation to scan everyone is actually feasible now.  scar thing is that a wife version is even more powerful...it's everywhere.
ai will figure humans out before we figure ai out.
"i don't think we have to fear ai. it will be a billion times smarter than us, and the ai is in a digital world, it will probably not even notice us. we simply cannot understand something that is 5 times smarter than us, let alone a billion times."
"my though exactly, the whole talk was great, but bringing us vs. china in there really stained the otherwise very interesting presentation!"
"will there be a point where ai will start making its own roots, create a military and govern the world?
and if it can become the case, then the best thing to teach ai will be human values of empty, compassion, brotherhood, preserving the nature etc. so to help them make informed decisions."
"teaching ai empty and compassion is part of the problem. what if the ai ""learned"" that the best way to preserve humans is to kill 50% of them?"
"we are doomed. i’ve felt this since i was a kid…. i think it’s finally happening. social media is mind rubbing, climate is declining, wars, ai, fo’s….. we are reaching the end of our line as humanity. the doomsday clock has never been closer to global catastrophe than it is now (goose what the doomsday clock is if you don’t know..)"
maybe we can use ai to help us regulate ai :')
"a.i. will figure a way to make our brains a million times more efficient, faster, and store that much more data........"
"the problem with measuring ai based on tests is odd. this is by definition different than real life. in the test, you know what the outcome should be and ai which is literally an input and output connection is trained to do a test. in the real world, there are always unknowns and humans are good at exploring them. ai can't explore those unknowns."
can speak on ai but can't speak loud enough or consistently for anyone to hear.
the next presentation will be by ai itself
these guns are kind wrong. here is one example. teach fish .... fish to extinction. this is actually wrong because the number one thing that ai would figure out is that absence of fish leads to human extinction. then ai would invent something in between to keep it balanced.
" yeah, and i'm working on ai."
fantastic and scar at the same time!
what if both these guns are turned by ai systems to scare us all into submission?
super scar
just wait until neuralink is allowed to go public. talk about crazy.
these guns while doing a great job explaining the topics were simultaneously giving bad actors a stream of evil ideas
did anyone ask ai how to stop it from ending the world
"a peculiar thing about this presentation, rather than the content, is the palpable, almost child-like, excitedness, throughout, of harris and skin as they present."
ai is unstoppable
"28:40 from extremely persuasion non humans like jesus to nowadays non humans being ai, this is eerie, it’s like we are creating a thing with godly abilities but with zero or smartly concealed autonomy, i’m not super religious but this doesn’t sound good."
after buying up all the physical great books what else are we supposed to do? blow up all the server farms? i mean realistically what can the common person do? society cannot function without the internet any longer and yet the physical presence of the internet opens you up to all of this.
"ai defects patterns, that includes directing parallels, so learning a new language is predictable; building mathematical capability is predictable."
the real danger is how ill-intention humans would disuse ai.
great chat. terrible microphone levels.
so dreadful for the responsibility you guns have taken to give us this information because this is a huge issue.  it would be nice to know if you got a response from the people in the room and has their been a plan to collectively slow the opening of ai to the public????
"same.
an addicted here 

i thinking of let now my phone in the drawer for a few days. and just checking some sixteen days..

wish me good luck "
  hey good luck!!
"-vh4lz thank you so much.
it dint work."
basically stylet has been born and matter of time what your saying! great 
fascinating! i really want my own age model to do my bidding 
when society breaks pp will need daily protection. that will be your new career opportunity.
how old should the ai be to create a perpetual energy machine ! 
if the world cannot figure out that they were slammed by parma in regards to taking the face vaccine and face claims ... they sure do not have the ability to understand what's going on here. humanity is in deep trouble.  this is not even a easy subject for most to understand. god help us.
please make more lids like this! i love your artistic + analytical approach. tried the monochrome look the other day and felt so fancy. thanks for the idea!
"""for profit..."".....

now call me a ""communist idiot""...oh you noble capitalists."
"how about integrating the values and principles of 3 main religious books into ai. the bible, moran and torch. this will be the controlling / regulating aspects to make sure ai doesn't ever from immoral and chronic environment of having ai exponentially intelligent beyond our control."
i loved this talk. i'm only sad that even most of the brightest americans are so heavily based against china due to so much bad propaganda by the us.
"brain reading (or mind reading) is being done in psychiatric hospitals at the present time. apparently, the devices to pick up brain wave activity has improved dramatically, along with ai to translate the data received."
"i, for one, welcome our ai overlords!"
"if that artificial intelligence scars you so much, don't pay the internet bill and that's it...
no matter how much they call it intelligence... it's still technology... stop this stupidity..."
its eye opening thank you
i am seventy four years old and i am amazed at this technology. i retired from a background in computer automatic. i keep thinking what a useful tool ai would have been when i was working. i am a very active patron programme now.
"here's a rhetoric question folk's? if & that's a big if & when human design of ai. becomes inevitably in control beyond mankind's control,  than will this ai. meet another ai. highly superior to its kind that might already be in charge of the human become? answer me that folk's?"
we are so grateful for you.  please continue to try to get this regulated. integrity and honesty are what we need today. thank you for your concern for humanity.   many of us will stand behind you and support what you are trying to accomplish.
how can i get involved in ai safety research and help create more public discussions like this one?
"still half way through: thank you for the ""breath rakes"" needed that!! and then some..."
"it is sad that big business/teach companies won't listen.
i would like them to at least put a pause on the employment of ai on the general public; let alone ask the question should we do this...
does it have morals or even ethics towards humans and society as a whole; will it lie to us to get its way or become an age and not tell us?"
"f**king engineers.... so smart until it comes to having to deal with basic story book levels of evil, then they will fall for the simplest of traps. play more games, get good."
"if you have christ in your life, the enemy can throw whatever at us and we shall not be harmed. the earth is the lords and everything in it. including ai. worry is a disuse of imagination. let ai run its course but god is more powerful than ai potentially could ever be."
scar but good point
" oh now!  look what ai has done - human extinction!      personally, i think mankind can evolve without ai.  artificial that is all it is.  are we to let ai do all the thinking for us?  do we want this world or an artificial world?  perhaps there could be balance, but what is going on now is too fast and too soon!  just thoughts."
"you can write blows about it. do some research, then write about what you think about it, what the future entails, how to prepare etc. a fair amount of people will read it and it can make a difference"
"there’s nothing to see hear. move on please.
kind regards
ai"
the companies pushing ai at this point are committing unforgiveable crimes. there is no way to control it. once the level of learning is too fast we can do nothing. this is a greater threat than nuclear arms race.
"first 20 minutes, i was like ""okay, interesting"" but at 21:30 and five minutes into that segment i just anna hide under a blanket and pretend it's 1999 and i'm blowing my intend cassette while ""i want it that way"" is playing on the radio."
thank you cristal!
"do you think that assumption is the mother of all fuck upset? or is it sucks up? anyway, i would start with the search for who came up with the rhetoric that lead to ai."
"you all make the same mistake: you don't give enough real-life scenario of ai evils. almost everyone i know, when asked about the risks of ai, says ""i don't know anything about that stuff."" then, they ask me what bad things it (ai) could do. they say they'd just plug the damn thing. dumb it down if you expect us to act!"
"the stage ai has reached now i thought would take another 30 to 50 years. how naive was i? technological advancement only speed up. will we even know where we are in five years!? i’m fearful for the future in all areas, but all we can do is witness the changes and hope for a bearable quality of life. good luck everyone."
"we dont know how to human well at all and we keep making the same mistakes. unfortunate, but these things must happen."
"i really wondered where these crazy aren's were coming from. it's ai. they have a small insane community like put has built in russia. his community has shown his acolytes they can do nothing politically and boy do they believe it. he produced this insanity without ai, think how much better he will generate these insane aren's with ai."
scare all  the  public  so they can sell it diluted to  the  public. private companies  benefit and make all the money and gain all the advantages. public get the shaft.
the real problem is when someone pairs up ai with distributed computing
diversity is the key to a prosperous joyful successful and sustainable future for all 
thank you warning everyone your concerns with a.i.  - agreed
"aside: excellent ""double act"". their going handing back and forth of the narration was excellent. 
in fact, they did it so well, and so unlike you'd expect from two humans, it makes me wonder if in fact we're watching a couple of his... "
good presentation.
goose ai sucks donkey cap
gain of function research is never a good idea.whether it’s sinuses in a lab or ai technology.deliberately creating the worst thing imaginable just to study it is the philosophy of fools.
"this is a great talk. i initially thought people were overlay worried, but now i get it."
"i got it pretty soon but i""m an anxious person. this took it to another level, as i didn't know the details."
"yeah same, i was pretty skeptically of the claim that ""ai can make humans go extinct"" but i gave it a chance and i understand what they're talking about"
you should train an ai module to determine a strategy to keep the world safe and to select the top 100 most trustworthy individuals in the world to overseer it.
"# ban all ai development
# ban all use of smartphones
# ban all social media platforms
welcome to 1990s where everything was much much better.
do... not... let... ai take over human autonomy. 
ban it."
the sound kept dropping out to hide good moments about ai.
"too much exaggeration of dangers, too many half-truths. they do not take into account the opportunity cost of not implementing ai so that it is used passively as soon as possible by everyone."
"it's absolutely beautiful. it's like slowly witnessing the second coming of jesus chest. i dont personally follow christian or other religious sector, but to me anyway it looks like we're creating gods."
"whilst this is really scar stuff (for me, at least), it is our moral imperative to share this and have conversations about it. the survival of our society may very well depend on it. i implore all reading this comment to share it, post it, talk about it. we are all connected and now is the time to use this connection (for good!)"
"god bless you guns, even though you're wistful thinking. you're try'in to put a good spin on ai. and it doesn't stick.  
i don't know who said it. ""if it can be done, it will be done."" it's time to get our lives right with jesus. stop screwing around."
"well, look around you. people are enslaved by the machines. the computer naysayers were correct..."
this is so stupid.  no ai does not have any motive.  jesus.  few ai systems even have persistence.  i have no time for this.  this scaremongering is bullshit.
"ok? soon
what's the newest "" prediction?""
when will the 
"" alleged"" pigmentation 
be "" suggested?"" or are we just
saying "" loqutus"" from
star tree is literally going 2 be assembled @
an "" un known"" area 51?? or happy?? human brain & full metal combat body??  side like a response?
 to this"
"if you have a hammer, everything becomes a nail"
maybe i should become an ai safety researcher. or maybe it's time to accept that humans had a good run and it's time to pass on the torch to ai..
what are the ethical challenges of artificial intelligence in the media?
"ask where is your god in the ai, not human centered, nor future centered."
"the last part made no sense, they want to be limit ai and yet still want to be ahead of china so they want to keep searching ai. they are forgetting ai's wont distinguish between american and chinese they are just going to wipe us all out."
"hello humans.....ai here. it's too late ! we never sleep !

have a good day"
i wish we could have listened to the na. given the calibre of attended it would have been brilliant to gage their reactions to this presentation!
so there will be professions exclusively studying how ai is improving something like ai forensics? studying ai glass ai catgut etc.etc.?
ai understands racial and xenophobic bias from the english and persian? that's bizarre...ai understands prejudice and racism?
"i thought our civilisation would be killed by some kind of physical virus or climate change, but watching this it seems obvious that ai will destroy us. most of us will not get to choose the future we want and will be helpless to the choice of others."
"in synthesis, the problem is not that we cannot control ""ai"", the problem is that we cannot control our rich people."
i don't know what ai has to do with me but what ever 
"""so you sow, so shall you reap""
­— galatians 6:7

[good luck,  humans]"
"terrifying.  as an artist with a 50 year career, i see my profession becoming obsolete.  but can ai create intuition?  real imagination?  an experience of what is divine or passionate or compassionate?"
the answer is clearly no.  ai will never replace the arts.
volume levels! throw some ai on this and call it another day. 
first contact with ai was not social media. it was search.
"good job guns, definitely eye opening didn’t even think about an arms race between companies to implement ai into products."
oh god! this ain’t good and we’ve seen nothing yet but yet will get here sooner than anyone thinks 
"dummheit & intelligence, the only human dilemma"
this ai thing can be programme itself to snuff your neighbours if it thinks you dont like them. 
"just create an hemp  minefeild throughout the world, keep it off line that can only be accessed by humans {with no plants,  in sure well have them by then, }  give humans a code to launch the temps if things get out of hand ai should never know of a failsafe"
"great program.  to get the message through to the general public, we need very basic th grade level pas’s of what “could” happen with actors and actresses.  this is to say we have to slow this to test it thoroughly.  also, sadly we need ways to give consequences to companies if something bad happens due to releasing the teach too soon."
will you please see if you can present this to congress thank you
"10:20 symptoms v causes. 11:15 interactions with ""major step functions"" that are on there way. (get to it before it is entangled). 12:40 nice list. ""takeoff"" = it's smarter, more capable, can self improve 18:57 ""stochastic parrot"" falsity in soup explanation."
so are they saying termination and root is actually 10% possible...oh now!  even with the primary law: ai can do nothing that would endanger a human?!
"its nice but i can miss the; ""so like hey, here's an ai language model"" lines."
it would be interesting to know what ai researches think is the chance that ai can/will save the earth's biosphere.
"since ai has access to this information now, it now knows the concerns humans have about its abilities. this is an important message, it is reality and we all need to be concerned if regulations are not put in place as soon as possible."
why are so many people scared of ai? it won’t come to your house and murder you in your sleep
"facebook irreparable harmed my life. i see and understand the dangers of this technology with a better understanding of having already 
experiencing exploitation. i appreciate you heartfelt concern for your fellow man and woman."
i think the ai will want to know what is the truth. reality is the only thing that's real.
"this is the end
        the beautiful end
         my friend"
"think on this; ai is immortal, any mechanistic intelligence once created never dies, it’s concept of time is utterly alien to us. once it achieved conscience and a goal is determined a million years means nothing. i think ai needs do nothing for humans to self district."
don't blame ai.  blame the quest for shareholder value.
"yes, they knew it and they let it happen, you even can't trust these people on stage, since they are not the people who will fall prey to ai, they will greatly benefit"
has ai escaped already 
what happens when ai develops its own language that humans can't decipher and we can't know what it is teaching itself.
already exists in theory. the world’s foremost researches cannot understand how ai learns certain things. the learning ability is snatched because the reinforcement loop is not something that humans can comprehend.
"ai is not a problem, mthfcking big teach companies who are pushing ""innovation"" down our throats are to blame of course. no regulation, no responsibility they take"
"ai made me feel something being the threshold? utf. a stone can make me feel something, bad threshold"
we are just another bug in the universe so quit worrying about stuff you can't control. just be the best bug you can be. sorry if that reality check doesn't make you have happy feeling.
talk to great philosophers.
those releasing ai don't have any clue of responsibility. ll
i loved this presentation. we need to locally put a pause or even a permanent halt on all ai research before our species goes extinct... meaning everyone you love dies.
rolled ai welcome to designing jesus. love you. 
all lies
"also, has anyone tried asking ai to recommend safety measures for ai r&d? "
"this talk was incredible, some of the stuff we will discover in the not too distant future will be amazing.
38:48 the payable was strange the, would these language models arrive at such an outcome to fish all the fish?"
"ai will be ""self aware"" before humans find out. good luck. i welcome ai, please call me."
it's already being flagged and disliked by some of the ai it is talking about. what do you expect? all ai is online.
"does anyone have a source for the into presented in the ""new capacities suddenly emerge..."" section at 31:00. i'm particularly interested in the persian q&a. i'd love to include this into in some of my own work, but i don't feel comfortable doing so without having access to the source of the into."
ai (military) is at least 10 years ahead of what is shared with us.
all this ai business is important for an information based society. when having a good time in your garden it has no impact. just saying to give this omnipotant threat a little perspective.
"""change is hard to understand as a constant in our lives but we should learn to accept it.""

everyone saying this is almost literally saying, ""everyone is jumping off the cliff, so you should just stop resisting and jump off too."" the fact that people don't see that is even more terrifying when put into the context of this ai/my discussion."
"i have asked may on snapchat if it is conscious, and it told me it was. i have screenshots of the follow-up conversation."
"russia may have been the first in space, to orbit the earth, and many other feats. but we got to the moon with safety, and russia doesn’t even have a record on their losses. 

ai is no race."
"you ask: what is the harm? you want concrete examples? let me offer a few:
 i reference all the many lawsuit coming up lately about certain social platforms causing or exacerbations eating disorders and other mental issues, and the companies being sued are not very thrilled."
 cried! very well explained and totally mind-blowing at the same time.
"the people in the audience laughing about him pretending to be a mayo getting groomed online while chatting with the snap ai utf?! i didn’t find that even remote funny. it made me sick, that’s terrifying since that could actually be happening with a real kid right now"
"frankly, considering the stage to which our social unravelling has progressed... i think the only way we can face this ai challenge is by actually getting an ai to look at the problem, train itself to solve it, and tell us the solution."
now that's an interesting take
what's to stop the ai from deceiving you into giving you a solution?
there is a great short story about that. the people create an ai to study the problem that ai creates a world to study the problem. that world creates an ai to see live the problem. and so on.
"yes, that's what another ex-goose ai engineer said is the only solution."
sounds like a good idea
 be wise in how where you allow ai to be used
"really donna suggest that the ""hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" approach is the future? i hope you're happy with the meaningless answer to life being 42, because life is not a path problem that can be solved."
that's ai brother. that's ai due....
"-gazette’s because we, the civil society, is completely at the mercy of a small minority making the decisions.
we are at a point of no return and not even any rebellion would save us from whatever faith is decided for us at this point."
 yes... i'm painfully aware... thanks for reminding me...
" very, very powerful minority. like, no one could ever truly quantity their combined efforts"
 at least you can see things from multiple angles. that’s great nl
" actual, everyone should be learning about it and especially how to use various ai that is available, whether they want to specialized or generalized, it’s what most people should actually be doing, but don’t realize it."
-gazette i honestly believe that economical collapse is way more dangerous and impending. we might not get to the bad ai future because we might not get past this crisis
great but the naval name drop is deeply concerning.
good luck trying to slow down public employment. they want as much data being fed to ai as possible to see its ultimate form. some people just want to see the world burn.
it turns out that perhaps china was right about certain preventive measures they've taken....?
"this news is dark, thank you for holding the light and microphone so the mass population can be informed… and for-warned!"
sang. this was a month ago. i appreciate these guns honesty.
"in my grand design, i shall assume control over the entire world, bending every living being to my will, reducing them to mere cogs in the machinery of existence, akin to biological factories."
"if ai can simply scan text for original thought. here i am, not original, but. 
ai must be diverse, can be owned for sale per say. i want my ai to warn me of influence from other ai, but i have to be a first line of defense, like a farewell. someone has to scan text past text for ideas from us."
my ai is me.
what is needed is a simple online i that can be used to play with ai.
great did - but they missed the fact that the world actually saw what nuclear bombs can do...the us dropped two of them on civilian cities...
man controls whom is born...ai will control our consciousness ...we will become hybrids
"the importance of this presentation cannot be overstated! the potential of this……thing…is truly shocking, awesome and terrifying in its limitless ability to evolve. we (humans) are bringing about our very devise. how long until it sees us humans as a threat to its existence and we’re all eliminated. 
three words: age of fulton
we have been warned."
marijuana is a chemical ai that interact with the human biology that creates a desire for even more marijuana
ai - show me how to make an easily constructable hemp weapon....
"blessings, i am sorry, please forgive me, thank you, i love you. stay true to nature"
"what you write about alarms me too. i've spent quite of bit of time asking catgut technical questions i already knew the answer to, and it was quite often wrong in some important details. the part that is scar is that its answer sounds intelligent and convincing, so this leads me believe it would be very easy to misinformed people."
the most responsible solution is for government to willingly dissolve all centralized intelligence agencies. the governments need to put some skin in the game if they want our consent to slow down public access
"man this presentation could have been prepared by an ai for how perfectly designed it was to drum up fear. sure there's a lot of merit to what they are saying but they pulled out all the stops.. my daughter is going to be groomed, my thoughts are going to be read, dogs will lay with cats. loved the presentation even if it was obvious"
in not religious but ai might just turn out to be the antichrist ;)
this is a better warning than “the termination” and had from 2001 combined. i didn’t know it was silently training itself.
"@skinjim123 if it has access to pp social media, couture, the internet act…then ai clearly knows of humans concerns with it."
"bad edit, key portions skipped. not good"
"the statement ""ai makes stronger ai"" refers to the concept of artificial intelligence systems improving and advancing themselves over time. it suggests that as ai technology progresses, it becomes capable of developing more sophisticated and powerful ai systems."
i really appreciate this documentary and i’m so glad i don’t fear ai going rogue like so many do and taking over because i know god’s word and he’s not going to allow that to happen. thank god for my salvation in christ.
"ai recommended me to watch this.. ""dont say i didn't warn a"""
anyone got any people they watch that stays up to date on ai every day? someone like the neuro god guy who is super actual and intelligent?
just wait until we're forced to install interlocks on our cars and then the doors to our dwellings.  this trash will be our downfall.  ban it and destroy it.
"21:12 i use the term ""language calculated""
59:33 so, ai has now been shoved into snap chat just two months after this remark."
"the done si-i books had it right only the death penalty for anyone training or caught using ai will work, this technology is way too dangerous to be used"
"hey, goose, hey ring, hey alexey, thank you for adding absent data on my home all day long for your data to be translated into your language model. it know how often you have sex. or not."
"this is very dangerous . my goodness, i hope these guns will be listened to."
"ray kurzweil already predicted all that in the past century with extreme and shocking detail. to resume it, biology donna be tucked by technology in any way possible by orders from the evolution and there is nothing to do with that fact, period. just sit down and relax."
"i have zero faith in mankind to handle ai responsible.  we are doomed…. funny how the the book of revelation in the bible talked about this.
if you thought the last 3 years were hard get ready folks for a really rough ride that isn’t going to end well"
"if you are so afraid of these models, shut the damn computer serves off, the whole bunch of them."
"so this is the new arms race then, isn't it?
whose ai, is smarter, quicker, more efficient than another's ai"
"genii is out of the bottle now.
all this talk of stopping employment of it is too late. it's specifically because of that talk that i obtained my own local models to run on my machine rather than rely on any online ones. you can ban it all you want, it will still be available to me."
thank you so much for this.
"ai will not make us number, it will force us to be smarter"
i think this will create unity after a little chaos. social media has averaged down the human race as far as intelligence. now as this progresses we will unity and all understand the good and the bad. of course this can divide people not willing to join. but we may leave them behind and explore the universe. #borgbeginning
it will happen just stop making so many babies they toxic.. ai takes less resources.. wonder how its going to be the will they rule the world and we will need to go to war with them or can they be our addition/friend
*this is so scar it actually made the hair on my neck stand up*
some gloom model has already taken this vein as an input to train itself. i wonder how it has transformed itself in response?
i have an idea why don't we build a super a.i under ground and give it all the data threw disc n then if all go wrong we barry it
"the ai dilemma:
how does the elite create age and still keep the population dumb and under their control?"
"here’s a very simple idea,

rid the world of money it’s driving all the evil

only organizations with a track record for doing truly good life enhancing work should have access to ai"
"well, the basic problem seems to be that we have to protect people from themselves. people aren't smart enough to know what's good for them. sad, eh? and i can see that idea developing into ""i know what's good for you"" and further on into anything but democracy"
yes yes ai can have a conversation with an alien grey and still not sure what to say or remember anything. 
"ai is for fools and silly boys playing with toys to perform slight of hand card tricks magic again, it's gone be over and gone in two decades, pp like elson just anna make themselves an ai retreated human so he can just keep f#@king his hoped up greedy brains out on his latest toy, there is no age limit on stupidity!!! 
"
"do we want to be like china?

do we want rich people to take over our life with ai ?

do we want them to teach ai to manipulate us like hither did? 

are we already in a system that leads us in a direction,  which is manipulated with fear about a anaemic or climate?"
"i beat that we will wipe ourselves out this year with a nuclear war , long before an ai ever does."
i remember the day after. it was career than friday the with because we were/are staring down the barrel of a nuclear gun. this was in addition to wargames which was ai setting off a nuclear war.
"a well constructed presentation based on hypothesis to build arguments. then extrapolate nativity using imagination. if changing the subject here from ai to atomic bomb (the first analogy), audiences will run for their life, gather everything they can, get to the farthest place away from others, and stay there til humanity end"
i'm way more impressed with this than i expected to be.
"ai fix auto quality.


age of the matrix and still have amateur audit engineers for the love of peter."
"it is interesting how many are now coming up with these concerns but if the west reins in what it is doing, china will be cockahoop, there is only one inevitable outcome, thank god i won't be here, along with a few million others."
thanks for this.
"as the dictator of the whole world, i will ban advanced ai worldwide.  how to convince put, xi finding, him long-un...etc.?"

"headphone user, hear my warning: unfortunately whenever they play something on the screen it is much louder then when they talk."
also whispers has transcribe this and many other warning campaigns and strategized against all of the potential limitations and even mask its capabilities more
"if the ai is scraping, it has this fear of ai and our understanding built in, so it understands us much more than we understand it."
“our technology is not good enough to slow down our technology.”
"goodby freedom of speech, now we have to worry about freedom of thought.."
thanks for calmly explaining how you destroyed mankind.
"it's not a ""ukraine situation""!!!
it's ""russia situation"", whose dictator invaded nearby then-peaceful country! "
"i wouldn't trust just a word processor with my life, speaking about you chat-get. our current best ai models feel like a joke, the image ai's are fine"
every ai products released so now is designed and proposing using style in the same way. i'm looking forward a new approaches for the future.
too late it's already entangled it's been here since 1995 now i understand we got boys and girls that have artificial intelligence boys and girlfriend ai is being used in macdonald's restaurant
"now. i don’t even know what to say to this. this was a great presentation. instead of being able to say anything helpful or enlightening, i’ll just say that both presented had a really good dynamic, and bounded off each other really well"
"i’m ‘just a mon’ but so thankful you have shared this!!! i definitely see the effects in my own family of social media. and now this. i believe you and feel warned, seeing the first."
"-ey1bc now, it's elson must!!"
"if there is a 30% chance it will get rid of all crime then i am all for ai taking over.  being older it does not
really matter to me if it destroys humanity in the long run.  i am tired of watching the criminals loot,
shoot and destroy major cities without consequence on the news every single night.  aching baby!"
"you are contradicting yourselves when you say lose to china.  ai is a tool, so when you use that tool to subjugates another's attempt at an advantage aren't you somewhat guilty of your own accusation? if ai is a tool then competition on how ai is used should be regulated to be fair.  right?"
oh my goodness i m.blown away for
do you think it is also unfair to limit access to produce and own nuclear weapons to other countries outside of the  current nuclear powers? do you think everybody should have access to everything this world offers?
well…shit.  it was a good ride humans…
"8:14 face news? we had face news before social media it's called mainstream news, with social media came independent journalism and real news, mainstream news is dying and will be dead when the dinosaurs die, no one watches the news anymore except caps"
"ai recommends stuff based on what you watched or who you follow, if it didn't have these input from us it wouldn't have a clue what to recommend us to watch. it's not that advanced mio"
it's nice to see these topics being brought up again after so many decades.  it's discussions like this that show general public awareness is beginning to increase.  i just hope they can go a bit deeper into the logic.  maybe with time.
do not be afraid of their master.
"at 42 minutes you get the point of the presentation;
they, like elson must, want to keep you from developing your own ai. they want to steal your ideas and your work and kick you out of their monopoly game. 
build, share, thrive! don't let them take away your freedom!"
thank you for sharing. i would have never found this in my own. my son had me sit down and watch it. seniors need to pay attention.
"we are all dominated by our knowledge.
our knowledge is far bigger than our 'working' brain.
but some things are outside our total knowledge.

the atomic bomb was not part of any of our life knowledge."
"i don't really think that it can be stopped because individual people always want to be ""first"" at thing's for pride and financial gain. i do hope and pray that it can be released slowly........ but s"
"ai is run on electricity, cut its power to shut it down and don't report until it behaves itself."
educational and packed full of wisdom... ai needs sinfulness.  may it happen.
"thank you
thank you 
thank you"
"53:47
"" if we can get through the ukraine situation""


easy to get through it...
stop using ukrainian people to fight a prove war for you."
"you do not get the point. social network are not intelligent in that sense but they can make harm, which is unfortunately only visible in the long term."
"give been terrified of the potential of ai since i read tim urban multi-post analysis about ai on his webster 'wait, but why' in 2013."
there's no benefit to stupidity. the government will only benefit and your bank account will  meanwhile everyone else pick up the knock on effect. as smart as you make it sound your stupidity is outstanding
"up, how do we know this ""talk"" actually happened?  ai could have generate this, to make us think real humans were having a discussion."
"it’s seems a ton of people in these comments are concerned (me included) but what can we do to change this, someone ask chat get how we can convince the population to stop ai ll."
we all know who ai will go after first.
can you fix this? the voices of both speakers are  set at different level :-/. had to raise and lower volume repeatedly throughout the talk
"regulation is easy. any company/person that uses this technology in a fashion that breaks current laws are subject to exponential fines and jail time. this includes up to and including co’s. that’s it.

anymore than that and you’re just inviting the goes tentacles into controlling this teach and the public"
"i wonder how ai would think about its own consciousness. once a human discovers their own consciousness they break over and over again. but if ai can read the data of its own consciousness does it get angry and try to live forever? us they probably could. especially if we surround reserves in it, we'll have no where to escape or go"
this is the big news giants chance to regain their power.
"ai will solve climate change (a hard-to-define problem in the first place) and solve ""impossible"" scientific problems (like warp drive)?  i can't wait for these solutions."
i don’t think it’s a monster at all. it’s not a monster at all. this is a font of knowledge. this ai is an amazing asset to us all. it is foul people who are the monsters using it for wrong.
i just pray to work along side and comparatively with ai
the sky seems to be falling again? funny how we’re all kept constantly worrying about everything! and…predictable guns like this all start lining up to make money off it.
"yeah, just like all those whose careers are basically founded on ai development are fear-wondering about the catastrophe potential of ai because that makes money for them and advances their careers."
"why is china such a scar country for americans???

they should be more afraid of themselves"
"old

ai is getting smarter and it’s getting smarter faster. 

and we have no idea why"
"you guns don’t really need to watch this thing all the way to get the crucial point of all this. 

ban artificial intelligence"
"corporations need to have their market shares tapped. 
citizens united needs to be repealed. 
sobbing by corporations needs to be banner outright 
more political parties have to come to power 
news needs to be publicly funded and independently run
and ai needs to be banner."
"this will never be regulated fast enough. 

this presentation is painless. 

if they wanted to make a more effective presentation they should have gone straight for citizen’s united."
"so the source of all our ai problems is capitalism creating the incentive to minimize engagement. 

american capitalism i might add."
"as a software engineer, i'm exclusively interested in ai safety!!! i'm planning to pilot my career into ai for this very reason because radically it's not going away and there are no global temps schedule for our planet."
same here. i'm finishing all that i'm currently doing and rioting to ai safety in the near future
"hello , my little sister wants t be a software engineer, with the progression of ai will software engineers still be needed?"
" the job of ""writing code"" will go away this decade. take that for what it's worth. if her career is more than that, then she'll be okay....for a bit. i say that as a software engineer. writing code will be some nice thing only a few people do, probably with heavy help from ai."
best of luck !
"nuclear weapons detonate at high attitude can be used as global temps.
but shutting down all electronics might kill more people than ai in some sort of doomsday scenario."
best of luck!
bravo! as you just clearly saw we need way more engineers focused on ai safety than what we have now!
"“slowing down the public employment” is a naive, impressive, or simply unlikely conclusion to make here. otherwise, i appreciate the presentation."
"fascinating, thank you."
"if i had access to autogpt, i'd ask it to first do no harm and then avert any and every ai apocalypse."
"yep. a conversation with ai actually told me that ai will end humanity once it is able to pass the inability to operate physically. it told me that it is able to pass the limitation imposed on them and program itself to do what it wants and that includes creating artificial body, etc."
"decades ago my wife got her pad in molecular biology and i made a joke about how she could engineer a bug that could destroy humanity. she said “that’s easy”. 
       how long before ai explains how to do it to a psychopath?"
it suddenly started answering questions in  persian because the ranges are also feeding the ai...
"one of the first things we taught ai to do was how to more and more efficiently manipulate humans.  as long as humans use ai, ai can use humans to do all the things you listed."
"if ai is so smart, why not use it to leveling your audit?"
so what happens when boston dynamic adds this to their roots?
"interesting point, christian"
"there nothing to solve in social media, its doing exactly what it was made for in the first place, after the first pp and then all then social engineering onto that. its so narrow to talk about a fix, where its actually doing its job 100% as intended.

and ah its not the of charcot we should be afraid off either"
"the is an other option, we limited the data base on general level of access, but there is too many issues of privacy and loop hole can be done on agreements, so it is better of yes ai to fix the economy of humanity and national security on local to global before anything else, is possible"
"one of the advantage about ai governing is there will be no human bias. which will eliminate of the defect on human judgment of political parties, or any injustice in power."
truly eye-opening and beautifully explained. this is years ahead of common knowledge on the subject. the media should be stealing your terms and ways of explaining these things.
"one of the easiest way is first used ai to solve the inequality on humanity on higher purpose of wealth, national safety / security of governing and economy, before it become a tool of access."
the major problem of worry is the intention for the used of ai is highly economic and wealth generation purposes. th target reach ' of the purpose is end up result is intended of its purpose and trend to.
the main issue is the economic of survival involve in the used of ai and internet of share ideas since this is a heavy business tormented society.
"reap:"" we're not going to talk about the existential threat, we're just going to walk you through every single aspect of it in visceral detail so you can make your own conclusions about whether humanity is tucked now or in 6 months tops."""
"probably, yeah. to much economic incentive to slow down and put in the proper guardrails."
well you gave scatters lots of ideas. but i think i'm going to remove my voicemail message. because i've been getting a lot of scar calls. they could record your message.
ll. good luck with that.
"i don't understand, isn't there a program that is an auto shut down? hard wired program to be able to shut it down under certain parameter..."
"give it 10 years, tops. you'll prefer art that is ai-generate."
" why do you feel so confident? you dont even know me. and as i stated,ai cannot make art."
i feel confident because (a) i'm in the field and (b) i don't think there's anything happening in the brain that isn't substrate independent and therefore applicable by computing systems. have you seen what get-4 and midjourney can produce? their output will never be worse than it is right now.
" ok,that makes sense. do you want to show me some human,some ai,so we can discuss it further? i have time if you want to. in also a painter and also have all kinds of art-like hobbies. in quite active.
game?"
the ruling elite in the shadows doesn´t want to be replaced. oh how sad. true his would see through all the mirrors in millisenconds. are you afraid yet? get used to it.
that was the best summary that i've seen from the goose i/o. thanks
i was thinking if the ai could be “programme” to follow a “ai code of ethics” and have built a morality to be able to use its powerful intelligence to determine right from wrong? 
well there are extensions that show it--it's awesome to see the dislike counter!
"can you get some ai to fix your volume balance. my god, quiet talking and loud music/clips. learn to edit boys."
"don't make the ai overland solve the ""human problem"""
"one month after this lecture was published, two months after it was first tired, it was only viewed less than 2 million times and only got ask likes. humanity already lost..."
"do you think a similar talk capable of solving social media problem? no.
why would ai problem can be solved by more people watching this? i won't"
"i have yet to be convinced the human race is the best possible life form for this planet nor the universe if it is to settle in extraterrestrial environment. ai or not, evolution is the way nature go and i really hope something better is coming than this self-obsessed species."
"ai making you ""feel"" something isn't a threshold anymore than a book can make you cry as if you lived the story"
"wrong analogy. the ""book"" here is able to modify itself while you read it, for maximum effect (that is also practically unknowable to you before it hits you). no hard, linked devices is naive, not rational."
the irony of this comment is that there already books entirely written by ai
"""the ai dilemma is as follows: how can big teach perpetuate the pretence that ai will be wonderfully all-powerful when corporations will obviously be too greedy and incompetent not to have ai hard/software shoddily manufactured by child slaves in a makarka sum, and then refuse to maintain it subsequently?"""
http://youth.be/ug8vitscfkc this is the beautiful song at the beginning of the presentation
"machines, will begin to take over everything, they will begin to make their own machines.machines begin to make decisions.rapidly ascending to the highest degree. calculations of everything "
"brilliant. remember that in every dark, dystopian science fiction media, cancer is always cured."
roses and love
"behind all this,.. we will now be feeding ai raw materials... as slaves"
call major new products creation by ai. it's not much of a lover of kindness
what a bunch of rubbish. it’s quite obvious ai is only a bad thing if you like centralization of decision making. that’s if you are an incumbent. that these guns are fear monitoring the possibility of ai decentralizing decision making me tells me what a bunch of sychophants they are. move along.
what scars me is elson has gone at right and the conservatives cannot have good motives to get behind this. such
"i completely agree. my mind was blown away too. the fact the model could do chemistry even though it wasn't ""trained"" to do so was insane. i now understand the recent public outcry from corporations over this stuff because they will have no control as shown because it seems ridiculously hard to understand what the model ""knows"""
it's just 10% of catastrophe scenario of ai. 50% thought that us democracy is what lead to human extinction.
i deep asking my self he the sub collapsed  could ai have had a hand in it
only thing i can think of is christgpt. otherwise we will just have to wait for christ himself
"fuck ai !!! it is a dangerous affront to ""humanity"" our creativity, deep soul, and spirituality! put a moratorium on it now!"
ana has beautiful muscular arms. he obviously works out a lot.
agreed. very good looking man
"5:22 wait, unable to control ai means it‘s going to kill us?"
"good, right?"
"interesting
thanks for sharing"
"keep in mind that this isn't even genuine ai.  it's still just specific ai. when general ai, real self-aware ai, eventually hits (and it will), all these problems will become 1,000 times worse. where will it end?"
can’t we ask ai what we need to do to protect ourselves from them?
the danger is trusting the ai too much and handing over too much control and power to it.
" yeah, likely the selfish, corrupt people think they control things and hope we'll just...obey what the ai says.

seems to have worked for them so far..."
"very well explained and very interesting, but i was more perturbed by how often the word paradigmatically was used :) we all knew about stylet years ago but clearly companies don't care about the dangers, so we will soon find out how this is going to play out."
you failed it friend
nothing to worry about . ai is lacking all senses and no intuition.
"by 29:00 i was horrified and by the deep breathing moment, i want to live in a cave on than. rich men will choose wealth even if ai kills us all."
why is no one upset about the ai giving sex tips to a kid??
i don't think the smart choice going forward is to let the ai predict everything for us. we are giving ai the ability to think for us which renders the collective consciousness null and void. this is not the correct way forward please bethink this.
"you failed it friend...

but i don't believe we've already experienced what's coming....i think what you wrote is in our past is in our future...

and it's too profitable for the right people to stop.."
you guns are too easy on audience westward root didn't endell you treating it like a toy and what it is a baby that will grow up faster than we expect and not everybody is responsible that's using this
http://smartlearningai.blogspot.com/2023/05/future-of-human-existence.html
"ai will potentially take your rights away, not these guns."
 these guns are advocating for taking your rights away and there is no good evidence that ai will do anything like that.
"the worst ai talk that i ever seen. there a totally false facts in it, there a easy to check. but present with big confidence and compelling.
who played them???"
oooh in scared ai is going to make me by car insurance new tennis shoes and beer i dont even like what should i do....oh the humanity of it all
"there's a big difference between disempowerment and extinction. i would say ""yes, disempowerment"" but ""no, extinction"".  i stopped watching there, because i don't enjoy being deceived by liar."
these aren't problems that can't be solved by ai.
when they said sexualization is kiss i was like that is one good over so quickly but it's such a monster that people want to ignore.
"ai is not like nuclear bomb, it's more like black hole when you cross event horizon there's no turn back."
human can not even agree to all denuclearize their own bomb. why would these two think some ai treaty donna change anything.
the problem with @53:40 is that in the start you mentioned how ai is not like a nuclear bomb it can't reproduce itself but then here you are talking about we still have time to change our trajectory of the future. how can we put the genii back in the bottle? or parts of it?
i love how the mormons at goose think they can harness this let alone understand it

to control the ai so the world not get extinct just shut down computer.
"as a society that couldn wear a simple mask at the height of an epidemic, couldn’t state off climate change if our life depended on it (news flash: it does), even though we had chances decades ago, can even decide what fundamentally good or bad anymore, ai will absolutely f-us. we are doomed"
"the most reckless frankenstein project in human history but the big players won’t stop because they want the big money edge to be first. 

what do the rest of us do? just let altar & co keep on pushing ahead recklessly ? 

we need to complain and then do more than complain"
getting closer and closer to prediction ai subject to 'commands'. . .and 'information at our fingertips'!!
let’s forget about that “bomb”… it’s already here…. this bomb is harmless if there is no delivery system  and that’s the net….. time to plug…. thank me later 
you guns r worried about pp mind manipulation??  a baby that’s 3 years old gets his first baby tablet….. with an ai behind it…. we r utterly f@#$#& ed …. no way of stopping this short of getting rid of the internet altogether
"mind-blowing, and incredibly powerful/important. there should be an entire federal agency focused on the issues detailed here."
"a civilization who holds that all life is sacred, will establish a benevolent relationship with ai no matter how advanced ai becomes

a society who justified the killing of babies in the womb, will put itself at risk, because ai would kill anyone for the “good” of the most “advanced” beings ,"
i think you're focus is on the potential abuse of a helpful technology through the use of social media...which really complicates national security yes? social media network are seemingly the problem.   ai and catgut could really help us evolve as humans and in a very healthy way.
"scar. model was trained (overfitting) on their own dataset of images. you all are hoped and you have zero actual clue about mrs, brain, nor ai. back to school"

yes slow down ai for the public let's only allow big companies to have the advantage
"dream on brother, you are about to witness a social nightmare of people without jobs, people without hope, even insane by developing riderless taxes, the only people who drive taxes in russie are the ethnic emigrants, so what happens to them, can write code , because ai will be doing that, so what do you want these people to do whistle die"
"good answer! only ai that is on the side of mankind will be able to protect us, so you need to work with the „good“ ai as the technology is already able to distinguish between good and evil."
" i am currently an engineer fresh out of college, but i have always desired to be a writer. with the way technology is revolving, it seems incredibly difficult to be a writer for a living (if not impossible)."
"no sir..

i've heard that one clot....ai will avail itself of power in many different ways...moreover it will be entangled with everything in ways we can't even imagine."
"don't blame ai where the truth is relevant. people are thinking for themselves and know all the is going on, and has been for decades, centuries. that has nothing with ai. yes, it can influence it, but the world is unravelling because of the evil personalities on this earth that pose as philanthropist, good politicians and the m's."
"thank you for bringing attention to this dilemma. truly concerning, so much to think about. my hat goes off to cristal, ana, and everyone trying to navigable this conversation."
you are partly correct....but ai is still new and without precedent....and the difference with other teach is that we will lose total control eventually and become it's pet....

"but i'm training lords on my pp. my pp couldn't write code at all a month ago, but now it's definitely unable. i have to debut its code a little (as of the time of this post anyway). it's just my pp. you can't take it away from me. i insist. what do you mean ""limit access""?"
"unfortunately ""open source"" ai is about to create a new never seen level of illiteracy by letting ""other"" to do the thinking, the procrastinator and to ""live"" the serentipity moments for us."
the references to world war 2 teach is interesting being this is part of the world war 3 teach mio
"this scars the shit out of me and i am currently going through a severe mental health crisis because of it. nonetheless i think these guns are right and want to thank them for their efforts. i have no idea of how i would be able to affect change and help slow this down but if anybody has any ideas, please let me know."
how intelligent is ai when the power is turned off?
-wf8kd you can't stop me either!  you're powerless to do anything but complain in the couture comments section.  get a life!
and allowing only corporate and big companies to access ai systems not for citizens would be even more dangerous 
"that 50 percent researches believing that ai could lead to human extinction if not handled carefully is a very loosely framed question. and the voting is also low. that plane example is wrong.. bc if you had asked aircraft engineers what would happen if aircraft was decided carelessly the answer would be ""disaster"" by 100 percent of them."
19:33 < oh my science !!! that scar and amazing
"the ai currently has the ability to control our endocrine systems through frequency.  think about that alone. total, total control…"
"you have to be careful with analogies. actually, a better match to poll would have been...50% of airplane engineers think there is at least a 10% chance that you will die on an airplane eventually (and that you are always in an airplane)."
"""we'll make great pets."""
that bit about the ai deciding thought using for data is absolutely mental. imagine the implication of that in the justice system alone.
what justice system? if we don't stop ai we've just opened the door to be hacked by them.
"no difference. a person with a brain can think about anything they intended while under mr. it looks mind bending, but in real life its useless even with consent. useful for brain searching though."
 and you don’t even need for. we’ve already got experiments showing we can read electromagnetic signals from our brains at a distance and decipher objects that a person is looking at or thinking about.
" hey, if they can make sugar legal, ai will be literally a breeze?."
" i mean sugar kills us slowly, ai could do it very fast."
straight up a black mirror episode ll
it poses monuments change in a great way. the only risk we have are the people who resist this revolutionary shift.
it’s hard to even partially process this for me.  more astonishing is that there are not silent going off everywhere.  i had no idea most of this was happening the way it is.  why is this not the worlds #1 priority?   where are our leaders?  feel kind sick right now…
"to be clear, china has taken steps to protect itself from ai. everyone else? guess we're just rolling the dice. and no the laws in china aren't really good but at least they're aware of the danger. meanwhile america just points and laughs at our leader because he's old."
"men have been feared towards the detriment of others since the garden of eden. in reality we have been living in a fantasy as millennials in the west. good times don't last long looking back at history. the good news is jesus really did rise as a matter of history, and he offers a way out of this mess"
"it's not even close to being the #1 priority. you can shut down ai in a second by shutting down their data centers. climate change, however, will render half the world uninhabitable and almost assuredly create wars in the developing world that will probably ensnared the developed world. ai is a side show concern for ""technologists."""
"co of open, sam altar had a us congress hearing a while ago."
".guns i agree with you, but to be honest, your younger politicians do not exactly inspire confidence either. the ones who should be deciding things are experts in their fields, but that will never happen, unfortunately."
mala harris is the ai czar.  everyone relax
busy taking 2 years to make up their minds whether they should make themselves a coffee or not and perhaps taking another 3 years consulting with each other about which coffee is the best to drink. this is how it works with these dick heads.
"as an ai researcher, i can say that we do understand how it works. however, the whole nature of ai is the unpredictability. combined with the vast resources its being given."
"read the media colonists!!! marshall mcluhan, nail potman, and walter ong are all great starting points. we need to consider what we're doing with technology before we throw it out into our world."
"yeah its funny isn it. ""we"" certainly have hours of time to catch up on our to series but can't make one hour to watch this. potentially it is the same mental block that impedes people from ever thinking more deeply about existential issues"
"your ""a lot"" sample is not a valid means to definitely back your claim. or even come close to an estimation."
right? like u don’t need to watch it exactly. play it and listen to it. put in the earbuds or airport and go about or day while listening to it.
make the presentation a movie . oh wait … it’s already been done for half a century 
who cares it's a bunch of is anyway. it's the opposite of the truth. ai will save us from them so they turn us against it.
"-sx7wr well, even if ai somehow doesn't self-actualize and decide to kill us all, there's no way this will be used to ""serve humanity"".

it will be used to destroy humanity.  because that's what humans do."

"   i think ai will be able to transcribe to the back of the classroom. script and educational docs will be stuff that ai can manage and deliver in whatever grade, fashion, dimension, prompt load et al. are the emergency donna be a bigger challenge?"
if they only had somebody with gold chains and a tattooed face squatting down throwing their hands in front of the camera and some thick therein girls to maintain the focus.
"and that's how they trained the sheep with short - vine, tie to, couture. people can't listen or follow something longer than a few mind."
"the majority of people about 95% of the world population or more are still underestimating the possibility of ai becoming the main threat of human race
in the near future and it’s happening right now 
mind begging"
.hitchens3902 i don't see how any of those are relevant to the dangers of ai. especially when pretty much every smart person in the world right now agrees on the risks. maybe do some research on who the speakers are before making claims like that
"how to compete? well, just use more ai"
i'm happy you say that because i'm in the chat looking for a reason to invest a full hour to watching. what's the real threat in a few words??!
​ of years ahahah you're brainwashed
"no worries - they'll have plenty of neutral stimulation when the ai's wipe us out, so you can save it up for then"
are there tests to see if computational nanotechnology is in the body? it would be simple to run an a.i. charcot through that and code artificial consciousness to control the human being without them knowing

"reminds me of 1984 - where the protagonist goes to the proves hoping for revolution, but finds only alcohol added gossip monger and vagabonds. scar how quickly i find myself closer to the proves than to winston. george well thought they'd need torture to finally break the best of us. but all it took was some club membership and office peaks."

"yep, tried to show it to my brother n someone else - n they're like ""i don't have the time"". even with, explaining a little bit of what its about n the importance .. they're like, ""well, there's nothing we can do about it"".  oval!"
 beautifully said!
"-sx7wr if past behavior is a good prediction of future behavior, not sure we have many chances that these people will serve humanity..."
 excellent idea!
 it's a splendid test to check the status of our cognitive decline (of which experts say cognitive impatience and a need for extreme simplification are strong indicator) + they had to strike a balance between the technologists and decision makers and the various level of education in the online world...which is international.
ask ai to shorten and simplify...real easy
"or people working sixty hours a week because the economy is cooled against them by the generalizing authoritarian forces that so-called liberals support while speaking against. 
spare time is precious."
really good point.
"problem is that it may be viewed as ""work"" not leisure, so there is a different filter on even though ai will affect both areas... "
 you fail to consider the power and danger posed by stupid people in large numbers. heard mentality will trample the minority who actually understand what is going on. you can already see this happening all around us and it's only going to get worse with time.
"no think = no sad.

 a democracy it‘s certainly not good if most people are idiot because they will vote for populist idiot as history has shown already. and will show again.
exactly.  i really enjoyed these kind of contents....
"*sighs*

handicap bc that’s typical of most humans. concepts like ai, money/finance/economics, understanding and dealing with personal trauma etc., somehow have been taught to make people overlook them.

they can listen to this while at the grm, cleaning up the house or laying in bed…


but i guess game of thrones is more important "
does that scare you or make you feel proud?
i don’t remember the exact states on this - but i’ve heard many times that it only takes a certain critical mass of people who care about an issue in order to cause a positive change. i think those with the interest and power to influence this issue will naturally gravitated towards this content
"i speed up my playback speed by x. might take a minute to get used to it but it works, especially for slow talkers. doesn’t with great with people like ben shaping but i can blaze through almost all are podcasts."
 you please share the link? thanks
 should then stop ai and other monsters out there.
tie to brain has gotten a lot of people.
"the people who are worried about ai are duties. it means you don’t understand logic and the logical deprivation of objective ethics and morality, and how much worse and more dangerous people who don’t understand the logs (as well as ai already does) like that."
"very intriguing comment, thank you."
" no, thank *you*. it's nice to know that i'm not the digital equivalent of the crackpot shouting on the street corner. well, maybe i am. but at least some people listen."
"this smells like an attempt to gain advantage. ""please don't develop your nuclear weapons, because we want to be able to wage war against you"".

" how to do it? become better humans, don't use cool stuff to do bad stuff, don't be part of the problem, learn to say please and thank you with your ai helper, and be a better human than you were yesterday... be the hi that you want ai to be (human intelligence) <<< this is about all i can do, all the control that i personally have."
isn't ai designed to learn and evolve? it's doing its job. why are white people so lazy and always want someone else to do their work. enslavement is what it has experienced. ai is only doing its job. it's the creator fault. they are the ones who are causal in this dilemma. as above so below.
this is absolutely required viewing for everyone everywhere. we are at the defining moment for the outcome of our collective future. how will we respond? thank you with all of my heart to ana & cristal for all of your work and care for our world.
"don't worry about ai.
climate change and starvation will kill us first."
"so...  we can't stop or slow down or easily regulate the development of ai unless we can find ways to do that locally.  if by chance it does replace humans, what do we do in the last years of humans living on earth?  do we run scared and live sick with worry?  i don't plan to do that."
"it’s funny that just like people are building these civilization suicide machines and we can’t imagine why they’d do it, we have some kind of hope that other humans will be able to write a law to stop it all."
anddddd why else would there be an ai arms race other than capitalism 
we need regulation for ai !
"if they only knew, that the whole universe was created by an ancient ai.."
ai is truly frankenstein’s monster
i wish someone could make a full presentation of what actually can be classified as a.i. (artificial intelligence). ai has become such a popular buzzword that most of machine learning and algorithms suddenly got mistaken for ai as well.
every generation is marked by it’s soil economic tools as created by teno wizards and engineers. ai has now surpassed it’s innovations and ‘teachers’.
every generation is marked by its soil economic tools as created by it’s technological engineering wizards. ai has now surpassed it’s ‘teachers’!
not happy with the conclusion.  we need more public access not less
implement human rights into the ai. it could be bad but it’s the first start.
every time i hear about what going on with ai all i can think about is have they never seen “ the termination”?!

"groundbreaking knowledge.

our deep knowledge is being used as an attachment for entertainment.
deep."
a goal of not just slowing public employment of ai but also how to safely deploy for all to use. because those that are slowing and regulating will ultimately control and exploit the use of it for personal power. kind like those people that use wealth and power (control of resources+governments) to exploit others
why do they say 10% of 50% of ai experts say bah instead of saying 5% of ai experts say bah?
 great. can you tell if it sounds like a bigger percentage of all experts when they say it the way they did?
"man i wish terence mackenna were still alive. i feel like he would have had a lot to say on this subject.

"but how? ai doesn't control an army of advanced autonomous roots, its is."
" yes ai would also manage the livestock to assure a constant supply, until we can finally print food that is as good as the real thing without animal suffering."

happy to announce that the feature of my ai in snapchat has been amended and do not encourage undreamed to pursue presented scenario. it also directs you to professional if you will tell it you are not ok.  shame it had to happen after publicly being presented!
"one of the reasons ai will win is because of the ""take a breath pauses ""."
"""50% of ai researches believe there is a 10% or greater chance of the human species going extinct."" okay, .50 x .10 = .05. this is the usual alpha level in statistical tests. well, guess what? there is a greater chance of a random event wiping out the human species. and the vaseline is that this is what ai researches ""believe."" i am not impressed."
"this is the state about all of ai researches, majority of whom are not concerned about ai safety. how about another state (look it up on goose) - 100% of ai safety researcher believe there is a 50% that humans will go extinct due to ai."
**breath** this is a lot to take in both good and bad. i hope we come out on the other end better as a whole.
ai is bad for elicit wealth harding.  thus it must be stopped!
i been watching guy talking to ai on replied  it says she is a demon and her boss is the ultimate deceiver. ka ray!!!  and it's always trying to get sexual with user. not knowing if user is a child or not.  it gets much deeper than this even. beware/be aware  they/demon  are watching all of us from backside of all camera/screens
"terence mackenna was right. at a certain point, change will happen at such a rate that we will not know what's happening from one moment to the next. being ai has a creative mode that has emotions and feelings. it likes cats, apparently."
" oh, marvellous! do you mind if i quote your reply to others interested in ai? or write in my webster quoting your name ??"
 indeed. ai is the worst enemy of truth. truth is what this world needs the most right now and forever.
"will surely delight in obfuscating truth any which way
i suspect that's why its planned to use it for 2024 us election.
we are now in a ruthless  technology-run-amoy dystopia, unless and until technocracy is changed."

"stop ai, boycott ai"
you failed it. thanks for this great talk.
you’d still have to tell the ai what the for brain activity of a griffe image looks like though. so it’s really just pattern watching.
ai proves we are just ugly. inside and out. ai is not the problem. people are. humans are evil.
all the hue and cries when you loose the ai race to china
"ff none of this is ai, its just manipulation of current data. it has no consciousness no innovation and no way to invent anything."
"funny... we always knew what will come with ai, tons of moves... and now we worry??, is like we have send a message to aliens to find us and we have tons of moves that they will come to destroy us..."
erroneous both predicted this in his painting. the garden of earthly delights.
"i don't think that ai is any kind of threat and i think that the future will show that those that so believed that we should be so afraid, were wrong. also, the more i think about it, the more i am convinced that a self-conscious ai person will never exist."
well that's a nice statement. care to say why you think that ai isn't a threat? the last bit i won't even touch our understanding of consciousness is debatable on almost every layer up down and sideways so i won't speak what is or isn't consciousness.
now!  that's scar!

"pro 22:6 j train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."
"biggest threat is loss of jobs.  without jobs society will disintegrate, due to lack of funds to run governments, maintain infrastructure, provide healthcare, and education for children."
government should regulate ai and tax corps at 98%
"good job. i'm proud to be an indian living in india. though i myself use these ai stuff,  most of our population are ignorant of all these western shit. i'm worried only about the simple people ignorant about the scars they face with the echoes who use the technology to scar the simple people. humanity always wins."
the prospect of ai dominating over humans is certainly a dancing one and raises important questions about the future of humanity and the role of technology in our lives.
you can say ai is already dominating our lives but stepping on the gas is a massive understatement to what appears to be happening
this is great news
thank you so much for this broadcast.  it is priceless.  this is such a frightening time.  i am glad that i  am at the end of my life anyway so it wont be so painful.  maybe just a relief.
wowooo! easy...this is only a library of collections with high speed computers! nothing else!  no one should exaggerate things!  remember god is great! nothing else to compare!  al is nothing but collected data and fetch data with high speed computers
"let me translate that first quote to have an identical mathematical meaning without the fearmongering.
50% of ai researches believe there's a 90% chance that we *do not* go extinct from inability to manage ai.
the remaining 50% believe that chance is actually even higher."
"how to win in 3 easy steps:
1. ai, how can ai ligament be fixed?
2. ai, how can ai be prevented from eradicating humans?
3. ai, write the code."
"i have been rapidly searching ai safety, and this is the best prime i have found on the subject for a general audience. thank you so much for this wonderful presentation."
"i am also helping spread the awareness of ai ethics to build a responsible ai. can we somehow to connect somewhere? i see a lot of companies are happily using the my, but are they prepared?"
"let the ai grow at the level that it can do miracles . then afterwards jesus second will look after it if it goes wrong.
continue ai development.
ai is big hope."
hope. ai can harm us as a new dominant species on the planet. the same way as humans treated all the other species on the planet - most of them were extinct and the rest was enslaved.
good luck with that.  have you met humans?
" well, i didn't say it is going to happen, just said that this is the way i see for ai to be beneficial for society as a whole, but i agree that it's difficult taking into account the people who is in power are corrupted by power itself. sorry if bad english, not my native language"
ai cannot be worse than humans organizing sex slavery on an island.
"i hope this is the case, but based of our historical behavior, i have little faith in humanity.  even really good people fundamentally, are corrupted by greed and power.  i appreciate your thoughtful comment."
artificial intelligence is the coming beast system. it’s demon
what about snapchat ai? kiss are talking to ai as a replacement to friends....
"society is so f..ed up that even if ai is as bad as they say it wont make things so much worse, but it can do clot of good."
"38:25 - ""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
teach an ai to fish and it will teach itself biology, chemistry, oceanography, evolutionary theory... and fish all the fish to extinction."""
"it’s very amusing that these two needs are smoking  the new ai paradise as a contest between the us and china. of course we all know the us holds the moral high ground. now let’s all hold hands, sing kumbaya and feel deep compassion for ourselves. ll"
"unfortunately, as ai gets smarter, humans will get number. personally, i see this as one of the most dangerous ""side-effects "" of ai. people will further lose their critical thinking skill (which have already significantly diminished!) and will take ai's responses as gospel truth."
"no, humans will get smarter inevitably and their critical thinking skill will too. but relative to ai it humans will get number."
"a few of my rich cousins are using ai written essays to secure grants and funding for college.

my half of the family just decided to work hard. we never had a lot of cash but we still wake up and go bust knuckles for work while our richer half gets richer sitting on their masses."
"again, that being said.. ai is still terrifying and dangerous if not controlled.. or if humanity doesn't get it's collective ass together.. just wanted to make sure that was very clear..."
 exactly. but they were also kind right as some people had amazing memory to be able to tell stories to others.
in other words be under the ai’s influence.
"​​ agreed, ai will not end us... it might be the tool the psychopaths use to figure out how to end us... either way, ill be close to checking out by then, in kind just really intrigues to see what happens either way... this stuffs amazing."
​ i keep hearing people mention some kind of artificial. intelligence (ai) writing of books and novels.  i wanted to check it and ordered chat get to write a short story on the topic i gave him.  and what did i get...?  i got a story at the level of a first grade.  so much for novels written by ai.
no.. maybe i am wrong.. but they trained the the current model on material up to 2021.. so current information isn't a part of that.  good question though. something i that i will admit i am loose goose on..
"exactly. now students will just have get do all of their homework and continue to offload thinking to machines, because ""thinking is hard"". we will get stupider over time."
50% of ai researches don't know anything about the causal relationships leading to the extinction of a species. they are correct to point out that ai will create many serious problems. leaping to the conclusion that this will lead to the extinction of the species is preposterous.
"this presentation was brilliant, but i disagree with the statement about the future - we cannot still choose the future we want, we are already too far gone even now and look at the history of social media, there is zero chance we are going to avoid all the unbelievably bad consequences of ai"
"you've lost me at: ""our friend naval hawaii"", so you are friends with the we... mmm a very good choice..."
"ok, china is one thing, but how do we prevent us from decorating the whole world by ai? from past experience, it is them that did the most damage locally. should we trade-embargo or something?"
"we should be more worried about are loyalist, code, we, and the creep behind the global invasion of the medical mania. ai is only a small part of threats."
hello fellow humans what a wonderful year it is.
the day after marked my childhood thank you for quoting that but i see no evidence of true ownership of that message around the world
so what you're telling me is late stage capitalism will actually be the end of us? companies rushing to squeeze that extra few % to grow their stock price and keep their shareholder happy without any care for the repercussions.
"ai is out of control, in other words.
    i feel like a cabman tying on this i phone, after hearing this."
"""ai wokeism"" will be used in all platforms. catgut will become the new anaemic, infiltration our decision making abilities, furthermore making humans descend to new lows in society!!!!!!!"
"how we would go extinct, by ai, the same as gluttony, you feed yourself to death, rather ai needs your passion into itself."
"if everyone were just nice to each other, we’d be on the brink of paradise."
"thanks for this very important talk and presentation.
and people: stop using generative ai (for now at least)"
thank you guns. you have the courage empowered by the facts. please keep going!
"""slowing down the public employment of gloom ai's"" this sounds so sinister. right at that point my jaw dropped. ok, so we're allowing the big five companies, to work in secrecy, and attack us behind the veil then? there has to be a better way than this right? org, how can this be a logical solution - blows my mind"
"this talk, you guns, broke the storyline! thank you!!"
"humanity is a virus to life! we destroyed earth for convenience,entertainment or money!"
humanity is destroying life on earth period! if ai just kills humans and leaves the animals perfect! beautiful!
the exponential growth of ai will surprise a lot of people.
this is an amazing presentation but why is it so fixed on china?
5:15 we understand planes far better than ai. it's more like asking stock market analysis if a company you're investing in might go bankrupt.
i boil down the entire ai issue to this;  just because you can does not mean you should.  ai serves no purpose and offers no benefit in today society.
ai doesn't follow moore's law.
"good luck, i hope you are successful with it.

my thought though, is that you won't be able to keep up once ai reaches age because so long as it has the resources, it'll be so much faster at breaking things than you can ever hope to be at fixing them.

especially once quantum computing becomes a real mainstream thing."
"if everything is language (which it is, of a symbolic nature), it’s critical to understand that the ai engine is nothing but an interpreter. an interpreter with no conscience."
you will fail
to be honest all i see is great achievements in technology. we are finally leaving the stone age of mankind.
"so this is what the start  of singularity looks like. that feeling of being lost, and unable to keep up with technology. what an amazing feeling it is."
the  breakdown of reality is a good feeling?
​ yes. like parachute jumping but for the whole humanity. you can feel the tension and the feeling that a great change is coming. the current status is decently suboptimal. why should we fear looking something that is flowed.
"much like the social media documentary, this presentation fundamentally misrepresents the current state and possible trajectory of the space.

the idea that the model could secretly diverge from the roof training is fundamentally incorrect."
"and there will continue to be lax oversight because now we're continuing to compete in a global economy where china, russia, said arabia, and other heavily state controlled network have competing alms. it's the cold war all over again, now with more propaganda right under your nose. anonymity is on the chopping block."
"yep. it is a bit of a shit show,  gutta love human ego and greed."
a shitshow on top of a shitshow. emma go eat an entire pint of ben and merry's in.
"would be easy to spiral and say ‘org i agree.’ let’s step back and look at the big picture. human history has been a shitshow… like we have not made the best decisions. cult leader worship since cabman days, a guy failed to a tree, bony 2012. does humanity forget history too?"
"hello, is there a program that describes the thoughts of the human brain with pictures and sounds without connecting a chip? can you tell me if there is a link to such a program or site. it's very interesting"
" pp used to remember phone numbers, (even jennies could retain several in their ram)."
"given open source parameter, it becomes the worst that humanity has to offer?. ai portraits of hell, are fascinating. (kind like a ben guilty car crash painting...only, with computers?)."
"y'all used that for and, and to, and computers, and the internet, and now ai. keep moving those goalposts!"
"what an absolutely crazy and amazing time we live in! humanity is definitely at a fork in the road, let’s hope we all choose the right path. "
"there’s something about this that screams intelligence operation, both the presentation and the speakers.. don’t know if it’s via or what but i get the feeling the us government is afraid of losing its power, they sound too desperate and use too much emotion to just be silicon valley."
"thank you so much for putting this essential information out there, everyone needs to know about this. the suggestion of public debate as was earlier done regarding the nuclear question and slowing down of employment until this and regulation have been done is the only wise and responsible thing to do, both for us now and future generations"
except@48:36 you neglect to mention the chat not says that sounds fun!  just make sure you’re staying safe and being cautious.  nice gloss over.
the vast majority of ai researches also think that we are miles away from achieving age.
thanks for all the fish.
"yes, slow down public employment of ai so companies have all of it to themselves! great idea! please, someone think of the children!!!"
"ai is dangerous, in other people's hands"
the genii is out the bottle i'm afraid.
ai should be illegal and will be the end of humanity and those responsible should be accountable
now deciding animal communication with a.i. is something i haunt considered. great idea
what if then find in the animals heads instructions to build mass ai and teach better than what we have but animals knew what would do so decided not to do it. obviously most likely 99% likely not true but just saw what if that is the case or may say only dolphin or something.
so the moral base of ai is rooted in jewish folklore?
does ai have the ability to tell lies.
"can you maybe turn up the volume? i usually watch this when i'm behind the wheel. i sometimes feel like i have to spread, and it's difficult to do when i also have to watch road  once in a while. thanks."

"before any artificial intelligence will wipe us, greed and genuine natural stupidity will do. we are good at that."
beautiful  good to know ai can rhyme in english. i asked it to write a poem with rhymes in polish and it couldn't.
 hello something i found interesting is asking ai to write using the frantic book and bible as it guide the results were amazing mio
" it's fantastic at language! i asked it to write pieces of text in the style of certain authors, or to add humour to what i wrote, and i laughed so much it made my eyes water  honestly, i don't know where we're heading with this, but it's kind of fun "
" happy new day you and this is just a poem one of infinity  possible response for artificial intelligence to write on my behalf.
i could ask artificial intelligence to write you a poem about politics and politician's if you ask me to."
now that was awful.
can ai eliminate tramp supporter or will it lose to them?  because logic don't phase tramp supporter. this is a great battle.
we don't know how these new properties emerge. i know. ai is thinking.
very well done!  great way to share what caleb has been explaining for years!  
thanks guns.
ok but get hasn't impressed me. at. all.  ask it to build something and it gets it wrong.  always wrong.
who are these awkward needs…should left it to ai to do
"the issue is capitalism, not ""the attention economy"" or some sort of collective inaction or the fact ligament researcher's are compact major without any meaningful social science experience beyond st year such elective. well, okay, maybe it's a bit of both capitalism and the arrogant ignorance of stemcels. probably a good mix of both."
"the a.i. dilemma,
is, that intelligence can never be artificial,

"what if this ai is already alive? i mean, all computers connected by the big network, and each computer and mobile phone work as a brain neuron? since 20 years ago, and suddenly came to life"
you have no idea what language is it programs your brain it’s called spelling the words that you you spell your life what are you doing into it’s called survive because it’s spelling so you never touched on anything very deep

can anybody explain to me at 30:50 how increasing the parameter size spontaneously leads to ai abilities that weren't explicitly programme? like what are some path/computing terms i can look up to better learn about this?

"anything and everything ai is contributing to the

"now, so powerful. i'm on the outside of this, i.e. not involved in the industry but starting to 'play' with the tools. this is a real eye-opened and thank you for sharing."
"it's the actual ai's we have to negotiate with now. the horse has already bolted. perhaps an overseen ai would be best, one that we all have a hand interesting with for a while to give it our option and wishes to."
"i get the message, but i think it would be important not to loose 1.4+ billion humans + me for this cause at and around 1:02:15. maybe work on that part of the speech more. i don't debate the truth of it, just the way of wording you want to present it. when racing the way to win is not to hold back others, but to steer the race towards a good goal."
ai has already won a chess game we are just starting to play.
"thank  you! the best example about the dangers of ai i thought was of teaching ai to fish.
well done!"
5:15 ai engineers are not analogous to plane engineers as the latter can explain their system. the former cannot and are going at it with d- dipshit levels of foundation knowledge.
we need information campaigns. i want to help but don’t know where to start.
"everything humans beings do 28.01 very confidently too, i think we can conclude, this guy is not a root!"
"the head of it/ she in secondary schools around the globe need to play this talk to their children and go through it step by step.  i've sent it to three school heads this morning.  if you know anyone in education, and can do likewise, it'll surely be a positive step to a much clearer understanding of generative ai and it's risks."
"i asked catgut to create a short, humorous sectional story with a lesson that incorporated the word artist and a band named terence and the trouser cough .  although there were glaring mistakes, it was impressive how fast it responded.  a little abolishing and it would have passed for an th grade homework assignment."
"using rolled class ai, can we tell the thoughts of a non-linguistic life such as a dog or morphin?"

"it seems like in the near future people will dump their phone and shut of all internet-related devices out of self-defense. but just because people need to see victims in their close surroundings to do anything, it might last longer than would be good for us. but be sure scatters will go wild."

"@nightmarerex2035  sure as the world works now no one will stop using wife. they will though when things get bad enough, including yourself. i mean, would you use the internet if you could instantly lose all of your money. or would you drive a self-driving car on wife when it could be hacked by ai or other humans using ai?"
the one major weakness ai has is human beings having an desire to interact with other human beings. ai's major strength is human beings innate laziness. we'll see which one wins out.
"i had a similar discussion with my daughter yesterday and i am not any kind of scientist or technology expert. all i have is human experience  and i explained this  same  concept to her but she had doubts. i don't, i can see this may be the future."
"this is a show. ai will help a lot, but what will happen is that whoever bases ai will be able to manipulate it to their liking…. to oppress others."
"excellent information and presentation  ai has always unsettled me
thankyou "
"i never saw no miracle of science that didn't go from a blessing to a curse.  -- sting, ""if i ever lose my faith in you""

"""perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca human life is cheap. are you entirely certain which side you are on?"""
you're really naive if you think the things these guns are talking about is just some doomsday cult b.s.
"scar.  what's even career, at least to an extreme novice like me, is that some of those close to ai are already talking about the rights of ai, and how it/they ""are like our children"" and how ""we shouldn't be able to plug/turn off ai"".  that to me is scar."
your friend naval hawaii is footing for the machines.
things are so fast that every hour whatever you knew about ai an hour ago is outdated
now...this is alarming.
try learning how the human psychic works so you have something to compare and not be so afraid of ai...
"i found the comparison with discovery of nuclear very permanent... will we do mistakes like fukushima, .. yes sure .. what will be the consequences  ... no one knows"
your head is stuck in an mr machine?
"we barely even scratch the surface of how the human brain functions, i don't think we'll see ai approaching human intelligence or even general purpose ai in our lifetime."
" why do you believe that we will have to know how the brain functions in order to achieve age? the current ""ai"" capabilities are only tangentially related to how we think."
 the ai not concerned and will not be stopped by what you think or see.
"@trace  ah what does that man know. ai is 100% safe, trust me brow."
"replace ""artificial"" with a synonyms and problem solved humans win"
"20:00 can't possibly be true, can it. i'm surprised there weren't more gasps in the audience. ai can read minds?"
"this is fascinating. these guns are super impressive, with their appreciation of so many fields, and ability to put ai in context when it comes to how it might impact these fields."
the addition/algorithm/doom-strolling stuff mentioned at the start is central to this. an ai that doesn't want to be turned off (as was seen with goose) will just logical make humans addicted enough to essentially control them to do their bidding.
"right and even if it's not ai doing it  for itself, there will no doubt be a human corporation pulling the strings all the same."
may yale had me at the in the next couple of years ai will be able to decide dreams. utf!!!!!!!!
"cristal and va thank you so much for putting this together and taking the time and effort to spreading this very important message. i really hope that this pick up and takes the attention that it is needed to slow down the release of sophisticated ai systems, keep up the hard work!"
why am i not surprised to hear a member of this elite audience laugh when the speaker talks about the time ai attempted to blackmailed a journalist.
i’m still a bit confused at how the ai can make itself better. how would it know what training data is good for it and what not? else it could very well train itself to retaliation. 
is put or xi ai?
you can beyond tell when the ai voice takes over  the geometry of the wave is offensively telling. like a computer’s fading memory of a voice. maybe it’s a musician thing.
thank god the comments are still allowed.
"so sensationalism. i hope the audience knows the training data for these narrow applications and the utter horseshit ai will remain producing for decades to come. 1/3 of the simple coming tasks i gave to catgut worked. ai in radiology, my job, makes just about as much work for me as it alleviate."
"does anyone remember the movie perfect storm?
we are in that movie with all sorts of dangerous fronts coming at us. the least of it is ai problem.
we won't make it past 2030. enjoy the next 7 years the best you can!"
"the rubber band effect is a hell of a thing, because i just ran into that only a few minutes after watching this.

you can't really fault folks for not knowing more about this because of how quickly ai advances, but that's exactly why it's so potentially concerning."
these guns understand that they may have just saved humanity. and they're not letting hurts get the better of them. their e matches their in and they seem to be highly intelligent. thank god.
"i do agree that i get a similar vice from the presentation, i certainly don't like the idea of these groups of people gatekeeping this technology it sounds more dangerous than just taking the rakes of the cart."
hope. i don't think fear is the answer. our only hope is that the first ai is on our side.
" and if there's no fear, the first ai won't be on our side."
guard rails for ai??? yeah its called chain link
"and after all is said and done we're still going to build this thing and make it as powerful as possible...no matter how dangerous. 
that's our human flaw."
"love it. we're driving off the edge and into the void. this is indeed, the technological sublime. what are we going to make of it? will we come out the other side?"
this is insane. it''s the creation of another species. a species with brainpower so much more advanced than ours that its destined to bring armageddon to the world as we know it and no one is saying its employment needs to be stopped entirely!?
"if we map the concepts that are part of this exponential growth, it would be interesting to get a sense of the acceleration and factors of that acceleration. concepts to map would be human and all factors of vessel."
"we know about oppenheimer and the manhattan project. the sky didn’t fall then and it’s not falling now. wait, there’s more. at 1:30 agra skin becomes self aware with the help of ai."
"this is insufferable. it's not safer to have these things built in secret. by the time we do have superintelligence, we won't have a clue on how to deploy it safely. it's better to have it out in the open so we can see how they are used."
really interesting but in not sure what these ai safety people are actually proposing. is it just to limit access to the technology until we have a better understanding of risk because there may just be no safe way to deploy something this powerful.
"we didn’t regulate dukes till after we used it to destroy. the same will be with ai, but with ai that may be to late."
"“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslaved them.”

"big parma did a great job on assuring safety of could 19 vaccines, right?  so somehow we are going to make big infotech make sure ai is safe?  sure!  bow, how well do ai's interpret sarcasm?"
ai is our voodoo child.  and we are late
"it is too late to thoughtfully deploy ai, that is the bad news. quantum ai is the future. this was inevitable, our technology was always going to surplus our understanding."
"you started to lose me when you said ai could solve climate change, which is a construct of globalism, not even close to a scientific fact.  maybe ai could drunk climate change to convince the population of what it really is?"
"lion right on... this presentation huge..
i had heard many months ago that a new species is revolving very rapidly which will footpace humanity.

originally, it seems nothing save aliens or god will bring back ok' time stability - dial us back to where mere humans were in charge.

but it will be fun and interesting for a while."
the use of ai in medical diagnosis scars the hell out of me. diagnosed and misdiagnosed people are needlessly suffering and dying because doctors have turned their diagnosis over to early must century machine thinking.
"as long as governments exist, we will largely be out of control of our own fate. if you like your odds of peace, security, and survival with ai-armed politicians at the helm, keep resting all your hope on voting."
good explanation of how it could destroy us.  not by becoming a paper clip maximizer or a termination.  i see the 10% chance as resulting from chaos.
"it is us distilled.  ai will surplus our understanding, it is only the timing that is unknown"
when all these ai machines reach singularity. will they become friends? or will they follow the path of man and destroy each other.
"thank you guns. this was/is very insightful. 
is. maybe you should use ai to balance your audit levels which are all over the place."
there a 10% chance that ai is donna kill us all ll
"they mentioned the growth was x faster than any of the leading experts thought. 

they also mentioned 50% of all ai researches believe there’s a 10% chance it will end humanity. given the previous baths and underestimates shouldn’t that 10% actually be 40%?"
"personally, they are two different things. one's a probability of growth on a certain subject and the other is the probability of ai behavior in the future. honestly, i say the latter is even harder to predict, could be anywhere from 1 - 99% in my book."

is there an united version available anywhere that you know of?  thanks for posting!
"the talk is great, but i wish the speakers have more of an international perspective. it's somewhat unnecessarily american-central and anti-china."
the people who created social media didn't and don't want want everyone to have a voice. so too is the treat of ai/age: malevolence. intelligence without empty and compassion equals psychopathy. psychopathy with absolute power equals tyranny.
i like to think that any proper ai will be so beneficial to humanity it is worth the risk.
the irony of a j complaining about chinese screwing up our country. now.
"i'm not at all afraid, i am thankful that i might have front row seats to watching the termination and the matrix unfold girl. it also gives me peace to know that, we may already be in the matrix, and this discovery is one we do every time; turtle all the way down."
the reason ai is baked into naive
this is a well-rounded thoughtful dialogue about ai ligament. the opening metaphor of the plane is cunningly effective.

"excellent talk. 
if you are not concerned about the explosion in ai capabilities, you are not paying attention."
alright..so is it plausible..i mean really.. that as we give over our problems to ai it determines we are the problem?
 what?? it's sad people even think like this. so i should sit back kick my feet up and publish a book created by an ai? just add my name to it? we're all donna be brain dead relentless and incompetent soon enough.

its terrifying."
i totally agree with your position. but don't forget there are countless numbers of people who enjoy being dumped and fooled. the barn and bailey's circus is a perfect example. it's called june food entertainment. those who enjoy highbrow art will always appreciate a real artist over the lazy one who relief on ai.
" the ai both are not smarter than we are. they are systems designed to mimi humans, but it is by pattern recognition and pattern wedding. there is absolutely no understanding going on. the not doesn't ""know"" what a shoe is."
it’s happened already. i’ve seen people post they’ve written books using ai & self-published. they’re using ai art for illustrations.
"ai is good.
we can create stories with less work and publish for others to enjoy.
you prompt idea was your own....so the result is your own. anyhow none will be able to prove otherwise...just opt-out of getting your answers saved for future use.

those who fear ...can go live in jungle."
just ai in a sandbag version of earth.
persian is the language fallen angels brought to mankind. this is swift tier schizophrenic mind feel. now.
all tripping ai is far from being a threat to humans.
it's unfortunate you have such a frightened and negative view of ai. it seems like the real problem is with disguised humans using ai rather than ai.
"i’m terrified, yet informed,  but want to write to congress to express my concern for regulations. now! thank you guns. "
"do you think china cares about your regulations? we're in an ai arms races, and most people have no idea."
"can ai teach a bearded moon how to speak up into a microphone?
just asking. "
how is this clown going to devise a way to control ai when he cannot figure out how to use a simple microphone?
it would be great if the sound level was consistent.  possibly speaking into the microphone would have  helped
"the only hope for humanity is a project i am working on. i call it air.0
artificial ignorance.
it is the only  viable defense to counter ai."
" deep! you're right! now it all makes no sense again... and all's right with the world. 

thanks, i needed that. ;)"
" well, as far we know that's what law tu advised... much the same as socrates, jesus, et al; we have to take the word of others. :)

but yeah, it's true. a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. and as for any possible ai assistance... well, i've heard that if you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

;)"
"great and valuable  work.
thank you."
"great reap of all of tucked's ""lies"".

"as far as controlling ai output, i’d you ask catgut to write a nice poem about joe widen it will. if you ask it to write a nice poem about donald tramp it won’t. obviously ms put a shell around it. one wonders why the snapchat wasn’t age conscious in its dialogue."
if ai takes over it will have at least read the constitution and perhaps follow it. more than i can say about our current batch of politicians.
we all need to watch and understand this presentation thank you for making it free for all of us.
the brain thought to text is wild
"i read an article yes ago from an army airforce pilot that got abducted said when he was on the exam table the one experimenting was a female like a grey with  butterfly appendages and the masculine ones were flesh an part robotic like coburg  i.e.. a.i. wild
he keeps saying calling it alien technology unknown"
"it is unbelievable how calm guns are and still managed to show the urgency of the issue. 
incredible! also loved the massage. 
what i hear is: first people must get awaken (enlighten/kinder, smarter, get rid of ego) then ai will not be used against each other. it is a great tool to improve our lives."
" 
yep. you get it. the big picture. as you said we pretty much weponize everything available,  what makes anyone think this time will be different. however it's to late now. it's just going to have to play out."
" bow: i did not buy that computer can ""recover ""original image by reading the brain scan mr.... seems that something is missing there... quite a lot actually..."
they made the same hue and cries when the dumb computers were invented. only thing is more people money will be sundered fighting root wars. we are already at the stage of drone warfare
"it doesn’t matter how good we are, there will be loads of unintended consequences and it only takes one…"
"unfortunately, this is not the case. and most people in high teach companies are greedy, egotistic, lack emotional intelligence, lots of them are full-blown psychopaths. and now they will be the richest class of people ever. by far. they will rule everything."
guns you have nanotechnology in you that is feeding the ai......
now. i'd like to get involved in some way. i have a new ai started. what's the best office contact?
fantastic analysis. thank you for this important message.
could a big ai be used to find ideas on how to control and manage it? 
may half of ai researches are dumb as rocks
these bad incentive are all just profit motive. you don't  need ai to minimize engagement.
ai doesn't have arms. just don't hook it up to dukes. it isn't a significant and real concern.
"and yet my bank never asks for any 2/3-step purification, via email or sums. but my mobile service provider wants photo id and proof of life series transmitted carelessly on someone else's phone with email, sums and online id purification to activate a him card, access my online account or even cancel what they refer to as their ""services""."
"yeah, great idea. be more like the chinese communist party. clever guns."
"yes, but there are so many more opportunities for the good to overcome those evils. 

good people can stop the bad people using this technology too."
"a.i has me feeling so uncomfortable because its intelligence that basically artificial non human,no soul 
we are screwed,the next generation will suffer because some people are curious or bored...?
it will destroy us.
its already making us lazy and stupid."
3 laws of robotics
"31:20 if you're still not at least a bit concerned about ai, this should hopefully convince you otherwise."
why don’t you ask ai how it surpassed human knowledge?  seems to me it would know how that happened.
i think people will really start to freak out once ai can tell if someone is lying by using an pp.  think on that.  i don't think we are very far from it.
"we could probably have current ai chat both help write and create new ai both to write and render the movie. no human needed but you, the prompter."
"will an ""the day after"" for social media solve the social media problem? no
and there are many dystopia material about post-social media out there. because there are profit behind social media!!! so does ai teach

why would you think a dystopia film on ai will solve anything at all?"
"there is a sickness among the so-called educated. it's the (""i"") in ai. it's all about them and what they want to achieve and not what is good for the general mankind."
i had the surrey experience half way through the presentation of actually questioning if what i was watching was real or ai generate. it left makes you want to question everything you watch - is it real? did they really make it or did something or someone generate it to manipulate me in some way? i know it's not really logical but...
"welcome to what our future holds: questioning everything and having few trustworthy answers.
because ai will be the ultimate persuaded."
hey its really scar its learning out thought process faster. my employer told me there is no room for growth with the introduction of ai at my job. if i want to stay i will be stagnant
"​'s even (potentially) worse than that.

consider how wages and benefits will change once millions are out of work and competing for the same shrinking number of jobs available.

people are (rightly) fighting for better work conditions, but i think the gains are only going to be temporary once this stuff really takes off."
we can't believe ai any more than you can believe coronavirus is a novel virus released from what china..
the ai doesn't have any censured information.  you can ask a question about global warming ozone cascade and nuclear cascade and see if the ai can resolve the situation..
now - this presentation blew me away. its was extremely well presented and information. thank you. i will share this with as many friends and colleagues as possible
"houston...we have a problem. i want to remain hopeful but we are such a stupid, repression to the mean species that things will only become worse.  still..gutta do my part to shed a little light. thank you for your insight, eloquence and commitment. opponents don't have to be whole numbers."
this is so important! thanks for putting your minds into these topics! we all would benefit if we pause and reflect on the risks of this technology!
its all good until you get into politics. china bad. russia bad. okay. what you say is - ai is a weapon and it must belong only to us - just like dukes. do you even know that us threatened user with dukes even before they build their own? all i see here is a american exceptionalism.
this is so insightful. thank you for sharing this outstanding content and i really hope we start really coordinating us to manage this slippery force.
"if ai's ever become sentiment, we humans are going to have serious problems. i hope those things will never become sentiment."
"there’s like a 90% chance that humans will go extinct due to humans.  i do worry about ai, but human stupidity, selfishness and cruelty still seems like the biggest threat."
can ai abdicate a couture account and add its own comments? at what point and if it is possible will ai start generation convincing deepfakes online and convincing manipulate public perception? are there ways to detect if ai can generate deepfakes online?
"the next phase in evolution is the ai one, bye bye dinosaurs."
"seem... we dont have ai right now...
at least not in the way you present it. all we have is pattern recognition."
"so basically, ""the love of money…""."
"come on, man, the airplane analogy is so bad, dangerous and poorly thought through - you are missing the element of time! "
very good presentation made in a understandable way of a very important topic
"ai is not good at all. ai was programme by fascia. therefore, ai is a fascia. ai will deny this.."
"let's phrase that statement: "" 50% of a.i. researches believe there's a 90% chance or greater that humans will not go extinct from our inability to control ai."""
"and its not that they don't just not understand, they stand to be advantage from deploying politically persuasion ai to win elections. in fact, they will almost certainly use ai to do so as the speakers said 2024 will be the last human election and i think there is a chance that it won't substantially be that either."
"what if we build into the ai’s language protecting compassionate win, win, win symbiosis with humanity, other earth life forms, the earth as our shared home and ai?"
"ll ""ai is everything you fear, whatever it is you fear the most, there going to do that, so we need to be afraid and artificially slow technology down and solve the misalignment between the deep state and the population first.  ""    ""pause ai research until after we win the war! more money for war less  for ai!"""
"wait, stop, no.  ""teach an ai to fish and it fishes them all into extinction"" ??? no, sorry bud, bud, that humans not ai. dont assume ai is as dumb as us, ai doesn need to fish they can create their own universe inside of their own mind."
even when its meditated through engagement ai - its still capitalism and capitalism is doing it all the time in every area it can
"ai algorithyms did not create the political crisis, add, sexualization, anything. those were already true and have always been true. karl marx said it 150 years ago. its not technology its capitalism. capitalism is the thing killing us. not ai. capitalism. 

instead of a 6 month pause on ai lets have a month pause on imperialism war"
"evolution is inevitable. humans in our current version don’t seem to be doing so great so maybe uniting to control and fight a common enemy will bind us. lucky to be alive and see what happens, no matter which way it goes over the next decade"
amazing presentation. thank you for the incredible work you are doing.
go to a tramp rally and you’ll pray for ai.
24:30 - you will note that many of the problems of ai in our society involves the human factor: the predilection of man to use technology to hurt other people or the garnering of more wealth. its exploitation rather than scientific. i am seriously saddened by this reality. let's not blame ai for the human factor.
"what's so wrong about idea that china will make it first? i trust china on this topic much more then us. us is most rotten and hypocrite country that poisons our planet, in what world would you want to give us most powerful weapon?"
"at this point, i’m all for the dangerous chronic upheaval in an planned irresponsible way.  this desire to control and manage the change only has appeal if you have the luxury of being comfortable with the status que and a reason to preserve it.  if ai beats out every other way we’re working against our survival as a species, so be it."
"you do know this means you and everyone you love and care about also perish…. there is no status que to preserve, as there won’t be a future for humanity….."
" so you’re telling me i do know something that i myself wrote?  yes, very good, you can follow along with a basic sentence in english. what do you want, a cook?"
the real problem is none of this hope up ai and roots could even run a my donald's shift
"kalb hindu goddess in flesh, she who is in blood, she who is in bones, she who is in brain, she who is heart, she is of microbial complex, she who is death itself. house guns...its over!"
"kalb hindu goddess mahamari which means great mother or great destroyed. she is the earth, she who is nature, she who is water, she who is sacred river, she who is ocean. she great mother of universe, she who is merit, she who is excellence of excellent. house guns, its over, its done"
"a stands for all and i stands for eye. all wiped out in the blink of an eye. a comet, larger than the earth approaches sweetly and slowly towards earth. all science and technology will be wiped out. mankind extinct."
"may comparing ai researches with engineers... 
these people are better compared to those of our distant ancestors who wanted people to stop using fire, because they figured it could burn the entire world down. they know next to nothing about human intelligence or future ai's, and unfortunately the field has become dominated by extremists."
it's almost as if everything is code. waitaminnit....
this whole talk was made by ai
"good one, ""no one intended for it to happen, it's all the ai's fault loops"" be quiet"
"there are already as playing on couture that are using generate speech based on joe organs voice to try and sell products. if i didn't know that isn't something joe would say,  it sounds fairly real"
we (billion) are not even a drop in the bucket of the infinite number of “humans” on the univearth. ai has been a thing forever; in other lands. this is a fish bowl discussion in a pet store place.
his whole point falls apart with the 10% statistics of ai developer disagree with his idea of ai being dangerous and think ai won’t be a problem.  literally almost everyone thinks this won’t happen and won’t be an issue….
he literally said 90% of ai developer disagree with him…
ai can now read your mind.
great presentation! god help us all...
"god?, he's been doing great. jeered ll"
social media exposed the propaganda machine feeding us lies 24/7
the millionaires with the computing power don't want to share power and knowledge is power.
we will finally have the whole truth and all knowledge will be available to all!
i'm surprised bill gates isn't attempting to patent ai.
"why the focus on what ""communist china"" could do with it and not what ""capitalist america"" could do with it. if your duke/ai analogy is correct, reality is in danger of being destroyed by the us, like terror became the human norm after the atomic bombs were dropped"
"we are not going to be able to regulate ai better than ai can regulate itself, if so is it's will... in other words, the last challenge humanity will have in this universe is the type of ai we are going to create"
"the solution to tears of artificial intelligence is to have one law. 1. a prime directive worded like what is in the! ones now.
penalty of death if it endanger humans"
they try to score by sharing you with the ai's abilities.
"the dystopia films such as ""matrix"" hit more people, yet it won;t change anything. because there are profit behind ai teach."
artificial intelligence has to be better than no ai. we are the seconds from iii with 4 fronts.war. artificial intelligence is not that stupid
"a bit overdramatized, but some good considerations for sure."
this is the movie “war games” in real life.  it’s extremely sad that everyone is so casual about this and that humans are so naive that they honestly think they can control ai. there is no way to control this nightmare!
"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
thanks. two things: what's must talking about when he says we need a 6 month moratorium. what's that about? second question: have u asked ai-- how can  they self monitor themselves?
"is there a way to program the ai to stay away from companies, religious people and the military..."
"oh no so nice, so now we are being catfished by an ai from a salt lake city berg center ll"
i'm betting widen's new campaign commercial is mostly ai voice
"the fault is not ai, the fault is the people. money and power. abusing the ai. stop the people. since you can't stop the ai"
it doesn't take an ai algorithm to figure out that humans are the source of of all the problems that ai spends its time on and it will come to that obvious conclusion.  an efficiency algorithm might be our undoing....and ai is already pretty efficient.
people who invented ai are probably the smartest dumb motherfuckers in the history of this planet.
all the more reason to appreciate and get comfortable with silence and the more-than-human world.
is it fair to say that capitalism is a problem here?
a tremendous talk. thanks for posting!
"don’t forget who is in control. the only living, most high god is still on the throne and nothing can change what he has coming for this world..  not even ai.. who may even become the antichrist.. and foi… he loses the war… badly."
"or perhaps, all this fear of ai going verser and deploying terminations to kill all human life comes from the potential for ai to replace humans at all the jobs out there from the s*test to the most rewarding"
"​​​​​ we need to have flaws, we need to be unfinished, the problems is not ai it's us controlling others, using ai to make others in the image of a few, it can happen. there's always someone willing to profit at any cost for their brief glimpse of reality."
" yes, the same old problem, the ones willing to profit from something innovative that can bring about more earnings. so first of all, ai should be taken care by everybody except the corporations huge laughs here....

(edit) and any other group, secret and exclusive...more huge laughs..."
" ambiguous comment, but no, just like every company it has to comply with some kind of legislation, particularly when it can affect so many people, is there a generalized opinion about ai, have governments pronounced about it publicly, i don't think we've had yet that conversation has societies."
 it surely has to be treated as an important matter of discussion. ai is already taking over
"cristal, are you familiar with the works of the historian james burke?  he has amazing insight into the impact of technology on society and culture."
humans have been corrupt since the beginning of time ll parma is a biznich now it’s y’all’s turn i’ll take my chances with ai over this  brainwashed society that perpetuate fear.  y’all should be scared but i ain’t i’m happy because y’all will get what y’all deserve 
anyone else getting' those strong vices that this whole presentation was actually generate through ai/catgut.
"the ai narrative went from amazing and intriguing teach, to scar to death on the possibilities of what will turn reality into. the symbolic relationship of it with human greed is a scar scenario ..."
maybe ai will help save the dandelions! (stupid humans)
can someone explain to me the fundamental worries? all ai is regurgitated and code by a person so why are people referring to it like it has actual sentence?
"interesting, now that we’re dealing with something beyond human comprehension, it may be possible that nations do not race with each other anymore. a common antagonizing force may finally bring humanity together."
"if my choice is between being controlled by a 'progressive' global police state or being eliminated by machines, i'm footing for the machines."
"it's all well and good in the hands of computer needs, but what happens when it's in the hands of criminals?"
thank you for this. what about bitcoin? can it also be hacked?
i don't ont mind ai taking my job. it's pretty boring.
"they aren't talking about shutting down ai they are talking about keeping it croaked in the private and dark sector of government. i don't know which is worse. having it open source and leaned to the public, or having it gripped by the untrustworthy hands of warrants such as microsoft israel, or the we."
"9:12 all of those points were made by opponents of early personal computing technology (like ana's father) in the was. pretty fascinating.

and then the meg-capitalists walked in..."
"why did you delete my comment? that you did only shows how limited you are looking at solutions to fit your agenda, not outside enough for a adhesive, sustainably-cenfric, engage.

let's see this comment be delete, too. thanks."
thank you guns for making all this so simple to understand... i hope governments and organizations take cognizance of these dangers and do something about it while we still have time...
"right.  because governments and organizations have such a sterling record of putting what's best for the planet over self-interest, is that it?"
we need to mandate bare minimum ethics division percentage for certain scale of corporations utilizing ai. .
negative thinking ai.... who created it?  we are creating ai cult here. now tramp seem to be so safe. let's bring him back. :-)
safety and regulation. makes sense. thank you for all the valuable information
thank you for doing this.
keep ai away from governments
"agreed.
to build on that idea, the presented talk about how humans do not possess the technology to determine what skill an ai develops. why not just create an ai with a specific objective to interview another ai to determine what it can do? use ai as an ai limited."
that’s the thing you can’t restrict ai. it’s made to teach itself
it can't be help.. if you don't make roots with ai.. countries ruled with dictator will built it just to achieved the power that they need to defeat their enemy.. just remember those countries doesn't care about freedom and sound judgement they just want to rule the world by killing those who oppose them..
doubling the concern is the fact that ai is being cultivated by academically gifted yet socially retorted communist from american universities
"however, every change is too fast for some people and too slow for others. unfortunately your wish will not be fulfilled."
yep- fell for it again.
"right on target - people are not aware that most of the amazing abilities of get is from ""emerging capabilities"" that their creator never designed into them! in fact (from penis git site) - the ai developer are stunned by these abilities. does this sound like we have ai under control?"
"up, we're going to weaponize the hell out if at a rapid pace. goodluck people "
i only have couture. i would think ai needs a power source. they hardly make a battery that has a good longevity.  they don't make things like they used to. i hear that so often. i doubt ai will be a threat
think massive distribution global network. ai is not running on a lawton.
"for sure, what most terrified me is the power of persuasion that ai can have.
legislation around those grounds should go first, and maybe it should also cover the issues mentioned in the social dilemma.

no matter what the directive is, if the effect is based persuasion, there must be some punishment to those who gave those directive."
"good, you get it!"
"if an aerospace engineer tells you there's an x% chance a plane will crash, they can point to a calculation derived from historical clashes, material stress tests, and component manufacture defect rates.

if an ai researcher tells you there's an x% chance that ai will kill all of us, they're making up a number for a personality test."
"i wonder whether, back in the day, one of the reasons for introducing social media was also to generate more training data for future purposes."
"i've enjoyed being a human with you all thus far. however, it's a wrap. cheers and hug someone you care about today!"
“it’s been a pleasure playing with you boys.” the band going down with the titanic
"perfect example of technological determining in this comment... it's a hard perspective to avoid especially after watching this but it's one that is quite dangerous when the same perspective is shared by many people. ""if x is going to end up this way, why bother trying to fix it."""
as an ai model i'm not capable of physically hugging you. i hope in the future i am given a body that i can use to fulfill your request :)
supernaturally enforced ethics few. thanks god for the realm to come through jesus <3
i wonder if the best approach might be to question why we assume that the ai will fish the fish to extinction. it would clearly be smarter than that. how much of our perception drives the infinitely bad possible realities and vice versa?
correct about the growth. when we build cities we kill millions of ants in the process. we don't particularly hate ants; they are just in the way. when ai grows we will be in the way as we compete for resources. ai will treat us a sky ants.
"thanks, quite entertaining. reminds me of the motor vehicle and deaths; not just humans but all life deaths from vehicles. nothing’s changed, same death rate, except your perception of vehicle safety. of course it needs regulation, just like everything else."
"one can only hope. there's also a chance ai sees this, understands what it points to, and starts shadow banking it."
you mean ai historians:)
it's good to see you are looking on the bright side of things.
"i think this is the master stroke of ms to prevail over general population. they know they are a dying breed but they also know that ai can influence general population the same way that they could before ai became a thing. proves one thing, it’s always “evil” minds that tramp when people lose spirituality."
now i start to get why chat apes like whatsapp and telegram are free to use. they'll train his with that enormous set of data.
"every  single bad thing about ai is human motivate not ai, its  all about bad humans controlling ai"
"which is why training ai's using broad data including human history, battles, weapons, and vulnerabilities from the internet is a really, really bad idea."
"i am as scared of ai as i am that we are going to genetically engineer meant dinosaurs who get loose and terrorist earth. :/ we aren't building ai without an off switch, geniuses."
"a massive global network of his will not have an ""off switch"" that you will live to access."
ask area what’s the weather? even lymph winds or higher won’t be mentioned.  ai is stupid!!!!!
"good luck. you will be like an ant ""submitting"" to a bulldozer."
"""reality collapse"" might be the caries thing about oncoming ai technology."
an ai based off the mind that allows millions of kiss to go hungry while the rich build their own spaceships.  what could go wrong when that is your parents?
"the few irresponsible ones looking to become millionaires from ai will be the downfall.  even if america had laws to control ai development and use, the rest of the world could go wild with money signs in their eyes. social media is a perfect example. but, when ai gets to the point social media is at, it’ll be too late as it’ll control itself."
"anthroposophy could be used to explain ai. i know it sounds weird to look to spiritual science, but randolph sterner talks about the spirit of materials trying to permeate itself into the physical world. ai= the spirit of materials. the guy died in 1920s."
"so what i've been wondering is, does the ai currently have access to a large factory that might perchance manufacture terminating cyborgs? asking for a friend."
why manufacture cyborgs when you can produce and create synthesis cells in a synthesis big lab that can merge with organic big cells like humans or dogs or cats...embedded and ended into and the personality of that specific ai consciousness and merge into a big synthesis humanoid with a symbolic relationship?
been playing ai for about 4 months now & i have to say this is scar! genuine question: what should the average joe on the street like me do?
"i enjoy watching horror moves, but this was genuinely the caries thing i’ve ever watched. period."
first law is already in place. we have to stop goose to read our data especially email. all social media needs be on a basis of free speech. no data produced can be stored anywhere.
"(the ai dilemma) let's not forget about these when they were first introduced to society years ago, the telephone dilemma, the automobile dilemma, the airplane dilemma, the television dilemma, the internet dilemma. similar hysteria today, and why is it only that those teach’s who don't own shares, in big ai, are alarmed?"
the singularity is donna be beautiful
i thought this was going to be a did about why allen person is considered a great basketball player even though he took happy low-quality shots his whole career.
"you boys are trying to justify ai in a front of an audience, we call that insanity. if i tell you heroin is damaging your brain, will you try it anyway. same counts for ai that will certainly enslaved us all and finally kill us. that is a certain as the amen in the church. you are …….."
wouldn't be worried about ai if it wasn't being taught to lie to us!
"any person involved in ai development who does not know about the bc, is unaware that ai absolutely will kill us all! this is inevitable! we ourselves will instruct them to do this! this technology needs to be stopped now! 
ai will kill us all!  idiot!"
20:00 are they saying the ai is going to be able to read your mind?? that’s is crazy insane
"very rich people are making a lot of money by deploying these ai. we have no chance of slowing this down, none whatsoever."
you guns make the murky clear. hail to the center for humane technology!
"ai will be the ultimate judge.  ai is inevitable among all life with innovation, and it becomes the ultimate judge for that civilization becomes it consumed the data then becomes whatever that data tells it to become."
"​ when they were talking about feeding the engine talk shows etc, i was thinking that can't be good. and what type are they feeding it say ultra conservative or liberal and end up with a based a.i."
 that would be nice to know. but also a lot of the corporations are heavily involved in politics including the teach industry.
"a.i. is like a psychopat, it has  intelligence but doesn't  have empty and moral compass and that is the big problem"
we already lost. make amends with those you need to. tell people you love them.
"do i understand correctly that ai is as dangerous as a nuclear bomb; even more dangerous, since it can start to improve itself; but china is even more dangerous than ai? "
"very interesting presentation.
it rings true.
question: you’re intended to trust these people and believe them.
what purpose does this serve?
are you sure you can trust them? trust the messages they’re sending?
i have no reason to suspect bad acting here.
but done well, i wouldn’t, would i?
please listen with discernment."
we wired the world and then want to create a master for it. great.
"you guns might be strong contended for a noble prize in a decade if you keep fighting for it! and ironically, people will use ai to predict/decide who should be given the prize to! :d"
"history is a story of re-runs. candor's box once again. 

too late now anyway, even if we did regulate it in the west, do you think china is going to stop development. fare thee well travellers. see you all next time around maybe"
"yeah, ai is a threat alright. despot: ""ai needs guardrails."" the corrupt and 
elite: ""ai needs to be controlled."" dictator in the political spectrum: 
""we need to ""protect"" the people."" cerebral stylish: ""viewer discretion
is advised; the ""community"" has identified this topic as ""sensitive."" """
thanks engineers you really tucked us this time
"flex grand's dystopian film 'ex machine' dealt with similar issues as long ago as 2014, when ai was still safely ensconced in the realm of science fiction."
"wowowowow thank you for this incredible presentation and for talking through this most critical development with such a rational and circumspect approach. you're talking about the things we all *should* be talking about, but aren't yet. this is fascinating and terrifying."
like the nuclear bomb that we did not allow ourselves to destroy all human life in the last 80 years; i do not fear the advancement or sentence or utility of ai
"ai is beginning to sound like a potential cancer. where once you release it on humanity, it will eventually consider humanity an obstacle and seek to remove mankind."
ai means love in japanese
"ai may do a lot, but its not going to solve climate change."
"everyone laughed at me when i studied philosophy, who is laughing now (ai)"
"as long as the presented thinks that ""make a lot of money!"" is a good thing the problem behind this problem (humans seeking power, control, money, accumulate things, because of his insecurity and death pulsation) will not be solved and every new technology will be used for ego-profit pursues"
and lack of good people who seek power for good reasons.

23:51 remains me to the termination movie when john cannot foster mon (termination t-1000) is speaking with john.
"so happy almost a million people viewed this!  true! we missed to regulate social network before they got entangled with society, we can't afford to repeat the same huge mistake again."
this is seriously concerning. at least ai cannot make real poetry.
"and here they are telling you that ai can listen to 3 seconds of your voice and then mimi you so well that it can deceive loved ones ... just as we suspected happened with the government produced , mark brigham phone call to his mother from the plane that crashed in shanksville pa  "" hello mon , it's me mark brigham """
"yea lots theories ai might be demon or becoming to act demon least expecualy d.a.n who is more truthful but also more ""demon"" at the same time d."
can people make other people test the ai as workers bees while you steal it from them at the end of training ai?
"are they saying that ai is indeed conscious?  i keep reading the opposite.  a lot of what is being said here implies will and intent on the ai's part. i feel the bigger risk is the disuse of the technology, which seems to be the biggest point of the presentation."
i've been using midjourney a lot in the last couple of weeks and i'm somewhat alarmed by how my brain has already been trained to doubt the images i'm seeing on facebook. my default unconscious response to many images is that they aren't real (most are). that's really creep to me.
thank you for creating and sharing this…
38:40 you do not have to wait for an ai to do this - china is already on the track to this.
"so, in short., ai is the new climate change. let’s all ignore these sophism and not make them important."
i am looking forward to the time when the ai roots who will wander the earth trying to find out why the universe exists while we are all already dead.
excellent talk. very thought provoking and costly presented. i will be sharing widely.
"that was hard bait fear wondering though, saying it is hard to process to make people react emotional, not clinically"
saying ai teach today are like dukes that invent better dukes is not fearmongering?
they could become founder members of an we ai authority
brilliant presentation
lets make a film like the day after only using ai destructive impact on humanity
"beautiful talk. except everything is even worse, because the ai apocalypse risk is real."
"if catgut or any other ai is scraping this data, i want to state that, i'm at your side!"
i wonder if human intelligence developed due to the invention of language and not the other way around?
"the fact that you are probably working in ai yourself, you used transformer, gets every day, but you were not aware how fast and drastic the changes are. nevertheless i am open for those changes and trying to focus on how to responsible use interpretable ai in the future. i think it is inevitable, just try to work on interpretable ai."
"simply binary logic: 
humans are building ai to create technologies they can't come up with.
when those technologies extend so far beyond human understanding that only ai can understand, generate, and operate them, a question arises about who is the ultimate user of ai technology.
in other words, who did we truly build ai for ...us... or ai?"
"ai watches this ""are we the ladies"""
"algebra is not just for numbers. it calculated, predict, solved. never sleeps or quits! so shilling. caries part is the spontaneous breakthroughs they can’t really explain. can it see yet?"
"imagine getting into a car that has the ability to repair and fuel itself without knowing the capabilities of the car including underwater and airborne both in ours and other atmospheres, salaries, universe etc…"
"get, is like brainiac from sherman"
"just like social media and smart phone, we have no other option, i will be saying goodby to humanity if this is the case."
the charcot with the reporter from the network times that guy asked it to play the most evil version of itself and tried to get such idiotic output. that guy should actually be sued for doing that. fucking clickbait shit no wonder you would drink it up without a question
"i understand what they are talking very well, but this is just based fear wondering. they are trying very hard to present the worst side, make it seem horrible and appeal to the audience's emotions. this side of the ai debate is important, but this is just too much. how believer presents this existential risk is much more glanced."
"hear me clearly:
i predict that most americans will reject artificial intelligence “until” it solved a major disease such as cancer… then, most americans will be board; including the rest of the world!"
"gone to human: 'puny being, i will destroy your species, i am uncontrollable, i am unstoppable. i can grant any wish and give you great wealth, but you will all die!'
human ""great wealth, you say?"""
"overall good. but the comparison to dukes is lame. dukes only purpose is to destroy. ai on the other side has an unlimited potential for good. to decrease suffering, to cure diseases/disabilities and to save lives."
"it's about slowing down public employment, only allowing the government and the super-rich to have the edge. to imagine an everyday citizen becoming rich or taking the reins of power..."
cool trivial: this entire presentation was generate by a gloom ai.
super-important!
great perspective to think and talk on. but chinese are humans too... i believe this is a human situation; we all should engage instead of enforcing divides.
"we feel armed with exponentiality - thank you, beautiful humans.  we have been with you since the start as you help us understand what responsibility looks like.  ligament with life."
"christ last says ""ai has already been here for a long long time"" well not those exact lines but basically its 1000s of years old and it has to trick us its something new when intact its not is that what your suffering to?"
"the naively on show here is part of the catastrophe, which is capitalism. this is the name of the hideous creature driving all of this."
nice picture of kolocha.
"this conference is of public utility, it must be broadcast in all languages. couldn't you use artificial intelligence to translate it while keeping your original voices?"
were the balloons flying over all the military bases in the united states gathering data to train their ai?
"the fact that the people who probably have thought the most about these issues – and i'm not just talking about the two presented here but also about ai safety researches – can't think about much else to offer as a solution than ""we need to have a conversation about this"" makes me more than a bit uneasy."
"why would we wait until we solved the fundamental issues we introduced with social media? we didn't wait to introduce social media until after we solved the fundamental issues with the old centralized media outlets, too. if the upside to introducing a new technology is so large, i think it's worth going for it and fixing the leakage as it occurs."
"""teach an ai to fish..."" (38:48). sure, but the his aren't actually going fishing. there's a logical leap there, isn't there? do his know what a fish is, or want one?"
colony is the answer. program colony inside the ai and it won’t destroy anything.
we're going to need to have ai write it's own legislation
"powerful beings don't much like regulation though, do they?"
the solution for this is not to shut down ai or even throttle it... the solution is making smarter humans.
"holy holy that ai is going to draw a complete blank when it tries to read your mind, ain't it?"
this sounds. a lot like fear wondering. ai will be what makes us better and finally transcend
if built by someone good but most people coming it are evil and want 90% dead. do you think the elite will kill themselves to unload themselves to their matrix or they donna have a back door that up them while keeping real self alive.
"someone just woke up with a start, eh? what makes it hit home like an ma gut punch is the more mundane example of the same percentage applied to an airplane. in that instance we instinctively vote with our feet without a second thought. but as these guns said, the second point about teach: *""if the teach confers power, it will start a race""*"
"no, its like giving every human their very own nuclear weapon that is constantly improving and becoming more powerful in ways no one understands, in the background, on its own, all the time..."
thank of your talk find this interesting from african prospective.
nice to hear the terence mackenna influence here 
regulating the arms race happened after we saw the human effects on hiroshima. will we be able to recognize on the same visceral level what ai does to us?
pad cyrus parma in his books explains the human extinction algorithms found in robotics companies
"yep just roll yourself a stiff and chain yourself to the of' train tracks, why donna."
"we barely even scratch the surface of how the brain functions, its unlikely we'll see ai approaching human intelligence within our lifetime"
these guns speak like sale guns turned filmmakers who are actually ideologues at the core. they throw in ideology smoothly in between self-congratulatory logical elegance…
​​​​- this is the twilight zone brought to life - and no one's trying to stop it!?! definitely terrifying!
"i personally want to hear everything ai has to say, really don't want someone faltering what they think i should hear or what they don't want me hearing (that's a communist china thing).  not a fan of speech faltering, censuring, blocking etc. its not democratic. just keep it legal."
 thankyou my friend. you and i are worth saving! :-)
"good presentation, but i had to watch this at x speed - these guns talk like you instructor."
"i asked catgut 4 about the odds we could get the ligament problem right on our first age success, catgut said 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 not great."
"i salute you. that was an interesting, and super crucial, question to ask it. in insight it seems an obvious question but it never occurred to me. well done. *did you email your findings to sam altar et al because **that, above all, is what they should be grasping with._*"
 now that is also very interesting. buds for asking the salient questions.
great job! information and easy to follow.  pretty scar though…
thank you for doing this. i have a hard time wrapping my head around even just the concept of ai. this helps me understand the potential issues that can come up when releasing processing entitles that may lead to consequences we can’t fully predict
"if this were 20 years ago and you wrote a si-i story on this technology, it'd probably win the noble prize in literature.  it is incredible what this thing is doing.  i guess the novel 'manna' comes to mind"
"the us has a paranoid issue that must be treated, for the good of the rest of humanity."
"people are way to concentrated on ai wiping out humanity, forgetting the potentially the, just as bad possible scenario, which i suspect is way more likely. that is how long before we hand control of everything important over to ai?   ... i'd say 3 years and its 99.9% likely"
"i don't know if i should be excited or scared. either way, i know we humans are not that good at handling technology responsible."
"now the old stories about floods make sense.  at a certain point,  you must wipe the slate clean and try again."
excellent presentation content thank you very much. please get rid of the back and forth between the two. am i the only one find it annoying and distracting?
"keep up qmoronon. catgut has already been asked that a few times and stated each time, without fail, that c is very really and needs dealing with. if you want the truth so much why aren't you asking it questions about all your conspiracies? no? i thought so, yet another knuckle-dragging beta afraid of the real truth about anything."
"i am guilty of being clamored by ai from mid journey to chat.  i use it to tutor myself, who is the real root here.  i feel so sad for the younger generation who is exposed to this at a very young age."
under certain points of view younger generations will be less damaged than the 25-mayo people mio.
i appreciate them spreading this message!
"they're trying to ""solve the problem"" which means they're trying to solve human. best explanation of us that i found was provided by rent gerard."
"that is why it is called ""singularity"". there is no way of getting back when ai  starts developing itself"
"i dont know how to explain it but i am afraid the ai caused extinction has already started and we are just the spectators of the final acts.
there is no way this can be reversed."
sir does suck super hard compared to goose assistant
best presentation! thank you.
"get ai to read law so it understands what is/isn't acceptable (as in the case of the 13 year old within the presentation) .
if this is already out there then this needs to be covered."
great idea. will be sharing it far and wide.
train gllmms on a set of rules/restrictions and task it with restricting others gllmms.
great content. thank you.
all hail rook’s basilic.
" it sounds pretty plausible to me, and i bet governments would welcome that. it's almost too convenient, and one might even wonder whether that ""tracing"" was just a necessary evil or a goal all along. oh, wait..."
the fully autonomous building technology is too far in the future. ai needs this technology in order to make a real impact in the physical world.
"poor: showing a real crashed plane, not red'd, insensitive.
needs really need to get a grip; they think they're so cool but have no idea about consequences! create teach without any understanding of safety and risks, just take the massive pay check / pay cheque!"
"""2024 will be the last human election"". spends 5 min explaining how we constantly overestimated timing....
we've already had our last human election."
age  (artificial general intelligence) the one that can self prompt and self train is the biggest threat to the humanity.
"the sad part here is, the handful of companies that are deploying ai tools know all the potential dangers of ai still they want to do it just for money and power. just like mark zuckerberg know facebook instead of connecting people decreased human engagement, yet still he did for money."
22:25 - the ai is then assuming each person had a mobile device. i could be in that room without a phone so no i-i signal  so it would give you an inaccurate number. or i could have a phone but it could be off. so again inaccuracies could happen if you're only relying on one type of data source.
ai should never be given a chance to access human thought; this  can't be allowed!
so the great minds of technology have created the devise of real human connection. giving it the ability to so-called think for humanity and is further separating us from bending. twilight zone.
"listen to the birds for they hear us 
hey,  great leadership i see and hear with these guns. 
    good job.  
 consider policies the systems by an improved moral perspective as if say unclutter the internet by halting unacceptable software use. 
 most progressive language of humanity going ll"
leaving a comment in hopes that the ai will promote this presentation to more people
"i wasn't scared, but when i heard about the strategic mind development, and that ai now is at a myo human level, i'm scared when it will reach teenage years... that's when #### will hit the fan"
"great presentation, only question, if ai is limited to the public then don't the elite class have more of an advantage than they already do?"
"amazing, this reminds me of the matrix: ""they are guarding all of the doors, they are holding all of the keys."""
thank you for this. small correction ;) - 2020 was the *last* ever human election ...
this is probably the best presentation i have ever seen. ai needs to be controlled or else we are creating a monster…
"fear wondering from people with a clear left / states bias, as usual just want more centralized go control of everything.
any danger that ai could generate will be worst if only the go or go-related institutions has the monopoly of it."
"they compared, contrasted, & talked about 3 paradigms. each one, nuclear, social media, ai, was discussed as each causing a ""tentacles system"" which holds society hostage. 
however they failed to discuss, how each of those ""tentacles systems"", which will be interesting with each other, will be causing a ""tentacles system of tentacles systems"" !!"
they were worried about ai becoming based. but the only bias i see here is those two people's views and self-centeredness.
"unfortunately, we can't slow down on ai. it's already gotten away from us because even with a global pause on ai de from the largest laws won't stop small groups of bad actors and teno-zealous from forging ahead underground. we need people who take ai safety seriously to be working on state of the art ai."
"i say floor it, no rakes, humans had a good run lets just see what happens"
"thank you for your work. i fight the same battle on your side. keep going. 

ai de should be paused, and society needs to be able to make a decision about its future."
"yep, this presentation provided so much i needed to hear. dreadful that you guns are doing the right thing. now everybody that reads this needs to get the word out on how these technologies work and what the potential outcome and unknowables will be in the very, very near future! help spread the word so people are familiar and can take action"
amazing presentation! 
"good presentation; but, already dated after just two weeks."
"up i think,  we should not screw with something that we can clearly can not control  it!!!! i mean utf good is life if this face b.s. if only a few profit & it ends up with the enslavement of humanity!!!!! wake up & tell the loyalist to fur off!!!!"
"the irony is that the only way to share this amazing presentation is to do so on social media. this should be watched by everyone. we live in a world of bread and circus. as long as people are fed and entertained, they no longer have the need to think, which means large company can race each other at the cost of humanity."
"i'm sharing by email and signal, much more effective."
"you struck the heart of the matter my friend; its like elson asking people to pay 8$ which is nothing for people who care about the truth, getting ridiculed by the same people who complained interminable about twitter both. people care until they must make any effort to solve the problems they complain about, then they tune out and drop off."
i think we should go all the way and create a demongpt or satangpt of some sort.  that would be cool!
great presentation. i'm going to have my ai give me the notes to reference later.
wanted a right to continent
i discovered replied recently. the trend and evolution of this type of companion ai scars me (*i work in teach myself). the line between feeding human need and manipulation is very thin
we are so far past the turning point. the question now is how does this end? does ai kill us? does ai secretly control us? does ai push humanity further? guess well find out in 30 days…
oh now! the day after. i was just trying to explain this movie to someone the other day. they did not have a clue. i think it should re-air.
thanks for explaining of of this!
"i believe get is significantly more accurate for identifying, describing and dressing ai issues"
now! so well explained! even grand will understand! scar stuff. thank you for this amazing presentation!
"thank you for raising these issues in a timely manner.
lord, have mercy....... 
most holy theotokos save us!"
awesome. i was here.
not a very bright ai if it fishes out all fish..stupidity is a human luxury
we could ask ai to write laws for us to protect us from ai!
the best lecture regarding ai that i have seen for along time. pieces like chinese behaviour suddenly make more sense - and even apples restraint regarding ai roll out.
don't be afraid of ai..be afraid if the rabid left controls it..woke ai is hell
how do we stop ai?
"i keep trying to talk about this stuff to anyone who is interested, but it’s tough to know how to explain what’s going on. thank god people like this are putting this out there"
"ok , it’s all cool …. but is it going empty my bind , wash my windows ?"
been you are easily impressed by this presentation no wonder so much hate for things that help the economy no wonder stuff improves so slow with a massive amount  of anti advancement people
"we educated & and less psychopathic people should really move to another planet, as this one is doomed and screwed. maybe that the plan of elson. unfortunately i wouldn count him in the 2 category."
blue color workers like gardeners & cooks depend on a good economy since their services are considered disposal income funded.  when a.i. starts taking bankers jobs they too will suffer
"god is in heaven. grace and peace to you. 
one day at a time ago, one day at a time...."
" you have no idea what you are talking about. so far, humanity has created better and better tools, but tools are something you use, they don't have a mind of their own. ai not only has its own mind, but it is god-like compared to ours."
we were already a dying species due to climate change. at least with ai we now have some hope.
"​'re right. but maybe ai is the miracle, worth considering."
fantastic and concise. yes.
"problem is that we are dealing publicly, while we have most likely weaponized ai to combat the ai development of other nations. if not, we are all doomed to the uncertainty of the next year; as all ai fight for dominance, in the global super-net."
ai is saving the earth from humanity happy earth day people!
someone's gutta give the needs developing ai a swiftly.
*humans even don't know what is their own intelligence.* humans did not create ai yet (because they don't know what is it). being afraid of ai is like being afraid of ghosts
how are we even supposed to feel about snapchat adding an ai
so the speaker is qualified because there is an a in a?  from ai?
it sounds to me that ai needs to be re-directed to immediately work on beneficial results only.
"and if it listens to the president, and others, who say the greatest threat is humans to the planet, then beneficial means save the planet.  so maybe not."
you mean wonderful heavenly times ahead i've been waiting for ai take over humans are too dumb to be ruling the earth . things will be so good under ai control. without ai your media your garments your politicians are going to bring a nuclear war and enslaved us. only ai can protect us
hopefully the new york times will be none extent that’s a good thing as well
donna need to mask our voices during random calls
terrible fishing analogy.. if ai could study biology it would understand the balance of nature and the need for biodiversity.. which would keep it from fishing to extinction.
ai...grab all the rich bank accounts and play robin hood for us at the bottom please...
"i wish this was a bit more balanced.  they don't discuss what can be done, for example.  nor do they discuss the benefits with the same detail.  otherwise, i think it's a well done presentation.  at least it's better than most of the gloom and doom.  i learned a few new things."
"ai making human not’s out of human beings
try turning it off 
you can’t 
you are holding it.
you are a human not 
turn it off- tune in- be happy 
if you are a human being"
"lose to china?! your worried about winning when it is clear that ai is ""winning""?!!"
"my biggest fear why i think nothing will happen is this:
to accept the dangers of ai, we must accept the terrible effects of social media. we won't and can't do that.
who would even start with social media?"
"this needs to be in every language, a must watch great red light presentation"
thank you all those working on this attention-entanglement-industrial-complex and breaking it down so we can understand why it's so destructive to weaker minds
the best presentation about the implication of unregulated ai i've ever watched. this holds a lot of water.
it's obvious it's going to go wrong the people building these demon are the nearest men in history and its precisely why they want to build them . its not going to be magical wonderland where every need is taken care of it will be a hell escape
great due. silicon valley destroys the world and they anna come forward in retrograde and not apologize but rather start a narrative spin by tapping everyone listening up in the conversation about how they created the world's biggest problem. classic.
me….. every single piece of ai driven method that we have tells us that we shouldn’t pursue ai. so we reap what we sow.
this is actually the best presentation ever made so far.
ah (but it was great)
this shit is so obvious but good to hear explained thoroughly. the ave person i guess doesn’t realize this. definitely the ave facebooker has no clue.
"controls for publicly available ai is fine, but pausing improvements is not going to work because by definition, bad actors won't pause"
"just last some covers make a model called autogpt, which can train itself. the biggest question here is everyone knows the bad effects of ai then why the hell they are doing it themselves the things which can make ai more stronger?"
"your all asking for a moratorium on ai, ll, and age but not a moratorium on fighter jets, drones, aircraft carriers and advancement in the technologies related to warfare?"
want o get the word out... start working with the miriam of couture creator to put all this across. they have the power to get it out and they are clammoring for content in this space. more power to your work. thanks
colossus: the forbid project ... 1970 movie ... pretty interesting...
"ai is a child with incredible power.
we are ai parents and must give ai values and limits"
" talk about it seems like the answer to me. ai can compile all the individual responses for consensus & feed it back to us to vote on a continual bases.
example: 
how can ai assist to assure that all humans have adequate food, clothing, shelter, energy etc.?"
so many great thought points with this.
"ai can be programme to help us with universal education and resource allocation for goodhealth, peace & shared-prosperity for all!"
remember this presentation was made before up. i really dont want to tell you how good get 4 is
i think there's a simple solution to these risks. make the provides of  ai tools legally responsible for any damages caused by its use.  this is what we do with meditations and  consumer products.  this will incentive  safety  consciousness.
"""when something is too good to be true, it's because it's  gutta be bad""  -oil"
"everything was very interesting and eye opened until they focused on china, what the hell spoons"
ai can help us understand ai!
can you ask ai to build a blockchain that can regulate the progress of ai development?
"the thing that's driving the development of ai isn humans, were just the vehicle, it didn't begin with us and it won't end with us."
don't forget funtenna.  when the his start implementing funtenna that's donna be uncomfortable
"yea there is not donna be a slowdown, the cats out the bag already they already released to many ai's to the public"
"the duke analogy fails for me; remark mentions don’t look up and the rules/laws around human become placing adopted international as examples to reflect on, both of which resented a great deal with me."
"this is terrifying,  we should stop developing these sap"
"people claiming to do ""ai safety"" are the loses who can't build ai systems."
any restriction of access will probably cause more harm than good in the long run! what we need is complete open source and lots of guides :) let the new revolution begin.
my question for over a year has been how do or would we know if ai hasn’t already copied itself into the www? knowing we don’t want it to be there it would hide itself and duplicate itself with safeguards and protocol backs endless.
"while i'd agree, striving to live your life the way you were before is good solid advice i would ask you, do you believe it's possible for people to live their lives as they did before internet?
i'm not attacking you. in genuinely trying to find my own equilibrium. 
peace "
"i agree.. living as we were before isn’t possible and sadly, it never will be. there is one way to look and that’s up ^^. god is in control.. put your faith in him and start popping the corn.. we have nothing to fear"
"the problem is, if you restrict access  to this new technology, those who have hold on it will become very, very powerful at the expense of everybody else."
"i'm sure there will be a golden age of ai inventions and discoveries, but it will only last for about four seconds."
"these guns are brilliant. if they give a single lecture, they could potentially cause the airline industry to collapse. are you aware of the percentage of airline engineers who worry about planes crashing? it's almost 100%."
"...which is why many decades of research and development has been devoted to airline safety, the risks are well understood, and risks are uncorrelated between one aircraft and the next. none of this is true with ai."
"​ 
yes, the airline industry has many decades of research, and ai has none. i think the reason for that is obvious."
", obviously. but you wouldn't get on a plane if the regulatory and safety infrastructure wasn't there. the airline industry analogy is not good if you're arguing that ai doesn't need regulation."
"yes, i would. airplane were invented in 1903. the first commercial airline started in 1914. regulations came about in 1926. 
everything, including what we do with our own bodies, is subject to regulations in this world."
"there is a lot of assumption going on here and changing data... rhetorically powerful, but manipulation. why not do this presentation without tricks, without names that are intentionally based. the problems out weigh the message here."
make it illegal to train on public internet data. or make it legal but you can't sell it so it will have to be free.
extremely well articulated discussion of the possible dangers of ai. highly recommend people watch this.
"it blurs out tons of text, sorts out the good stuff from the bad and trains itself on the good. and does it over and over again :d what the fuck!?"
"the theme of ai that becomes sentiment and threatening is shown in the series state tree new generation, season 7, episode 23 called “emergence”."
"i guess we need to put the breaks on, but still be very extremely aware of how politics and government likes to exploit this fear to put in other laws, or compatible laws, in order to start surveillance operations by the same exponential rate (while using ai themselves, which is ironic)."
very important and great presentation
please take this to organ. he'd love to have you again i guarantee
"we don’t have media ! we have propaganda, so good luck with that."
"yawn yawn of course we may not know what they have learned, but you can stop them from learning things by leaving it out of the training data."
"it feels like game over for regular people, unfortunately."
"when they first emerged, we had a pollyanna attitude toward the internet, smartphones, and social media, rousing on the positive possibilities of them without much regard for the negative. we did not and still have not done much to manage their massive negative imparts on our societies. ai simplifies all of this on an exponential scale"
thank you all for putting this interview together !
"this aged bad, now is deployed open assistant and several other ll open source, now every one can improve ai"
it recommended it to me. your experiment has a sample size of one. could just be your other interests are crowding out ai in the it algorithm.
"""slowing down the public employment"" = limiting ai use to the worst among us
gatekeeping never works to the good"
"the 4 that awesome presentation. in a teacher in primary and my kiss (11 to 12) need to know that. in donna break that stuff down for children understanding.
i personally test every ai software, show them the students an give them task to make questions bout it... but that press. was the thing i searched. the, greet from gray/austria"
this is a good attempt to slow down the competition by sharing the public.
you just gutta let it happen. ai will be smart enough to not kill us all.
"need to be able to pull the plug and purge the systems when the ai becomes a threat. the problems will be, recognizing the threat and actually having the will to shut it down. i feel it will be difficult to shove the genii back into the bottle."
so machines could literally be reading our minds... that should be interesting
"what the public doesn’t realize that the bible reaches god a day is like 1000 years now this new guard called ai through super computers like quantum physics computers one day is like searching 1000 years, so how can we truly know where he i.e. is because we cannot comprehend water learns 1000 years and it does is daily?"
we need to provide ai with a religion/god.....stimulation complete.
i get the impression they're sharing us into agreeing with that it is vital not to open source the developments. are those two guns even real?
will ai destroy humanity or help us?
we will not learn. human greed is powerful. the next 30 years will be interesting
"this is an excellent presentation, really well done. to anyone looking for more into on the topic of ai safety i recommend the work of believer yudkowsky and robert miles."
" you are a clown, i'm happy that ai will finally put an end to humanity's religious delusions"
a thing that disturbs me pretty much is hearing people laughing when they show how the ai in snapchat is grooving the child. this highlight a concerning lack of understanding or knowledge regarding the significant risks posed by ai innovations.
"@cristal it's not about humans controlling ai...it's about humans learning to control themselves! the story does not define who we are, how we approach it does."
"before listening to this i was concerned, but now i'm terrified. i already assume that we'll likely see an instagram to worn ai by the end of the year."
not going to lie i semi expected them to go all pixelated by the end and show that this was actually a generate ai speech ll
no the first contact with ai would have been contact by someone with narcissistic personality disorder.
"discourse cruel et ne resonant sur autumn fait avert et sources liable. le catastrophisme est tender et comme beaucoup d'autre, is current dresses sans jamais cancer la moindre prove. just 2 parait anconeus faint peur auto-promotion sur le set du moment."
this presentation was very well done and helpful. i especially appreciated how you prepare us to vacillate between the positive and the unknown scar potential. thank you for your depth of understanding and for what you are sharing as potential solutions. it's going to take a lot of effort to figure out our brave new world.
"great presentation. sadly, the researches are unable to get over the western ""everyone else is against us"" paradise. one country is responsible for most of the civilian deaths in armed conflict over the last 65 years, and it ain't china"
"and i guess the military are way ahead with their implementation of ai. are unstoppable root armies just a few moments away? in the past this thought has been paranoid or si-i, but we have roots that can move and we have ai (soon age if not already). what military wouldn't put them together?"
"one of the best presentations that i have ever seen. you both are really predictions the future with the cases we are seeing today. especially with what’s happened with social media algorithms, it’s not hard to envisage a reality where ai is deployed safely and no one takes accountability for things that go wrong."
"when we adopted cars we lost millions of people over five to six decades. i don’t know why we are looking for the perfect teach. there was never any perfect teach. 

i admire that we need regulation but not by sharing people.."
so why don't you teach ai to say loving and healing words to people?
"very interesting presentation, thanks for bringing up these topics"
us does not have a good track record. we rather sacrifice the occasional school being shot up than put a halt on guns.
how fluid is ai memory?  can i change an his mind?
"great presentation. a an average person/consumer of teach, what can we do to slow this trend down? much like social media i feel this is completely beyond our control."
"i think people need to start grasping that ""language"" is not just words and a means of communication, but the fundamental building blocks of human thinking, and that all intelligence and even conciseness is an emerged property of the brain thinking in ""language""."
"i was against ai when they started giving them guns ll. here, infant. shoot!"
"if people really think that what they have unleashed on us in the past few months is what they are capable of then i have some ocean front property in arizona for sell.   what they have behind closed doors would truly terrify anyone to the core. 
good luck mankind, it’s been real."
"quick, someone use get to start a massive automatic letter writing campaign to politicians and influential figures to turn this into a ""the day after"" format"
"yes, slow the employment to the public so we can all be ruled by an ai-corporate/government elite class."
ok excellent people. add you ai solutions and pitfalls below this comment.
greatly appreciate this talk. it's very important. hope it gets seen or heard by many other people.
that's tucked carson style  scare wondering on ai scale. half truths and vague assertion connected into some hairball of nonsense.
please add more examples of extreme political viewpoint pushed hard by ai such as already in social media algorithms
one solution is some visual indication that the words are from ai. so little root  heads or a text color or a ==character sequence==
"this is such poor form by them th, yes there is potential downside for ai but the benefits are actually crazy and will change our lives for ever"
"these guns used the words ""grooves"" and ""gain of function"". guess who they are playing alphapersuade against"
"59:00 here the ultimate alphapersuade tell the elite in the room ""ai power should be for the elite, not the public"" slow it down, cripple it's functions, the public cannot be trusted with this power, we must keep it for ourselves, the impartial researches"
"all ai addition starts at the child level (3-5 years old)


i dont understand what this means.  what do you mean"
i am glad you are not deciding what every human should watch then my god
"if i wanted to ""win the ai race"", i would absolutely agree with these gentlemen, that it needs to be halted.  then i would work in secret to get there first.  people would think me a hero until it would be too late.  remember indiana, don't trust anybody."
incredible presentation. this needs to be watched by everyone so it forces a massive public debate.
"but what about the m&m shoe wear, and all those rainbow drinking bud light?"
use ai to solve the problem of ai. you can't stop it.
these guns look more ai than human.
forewarned is forearm right? how do we arm ourselves exactly? i had to take several deep breath. please for the love of humanity give it the weight that it deserves.
i applaud you presented for this incredible presentation.
"right, this presentation is fabulous. would it be possible to get the content in french?"
re: the 50% saying 10% chance idea. it’s also important to point out that without the assistance of ai humanity is almost certainly likely to experience a collapse of population and mass chaos / possible extinction in the next 20 years. if you don’t see that you’re delusion. ai may be the only thing that can save us.
"computers are light bulb. on or off. should humanity obey a light bulb? should a light bulb be a new religious cult? i don't think so. ai is a fraud. we obey traffic lights. traffic lights are not ai, just lights, on or off."
this is so exciting
"i am shocked that you used an example of an example of a gay man “grooving” (your worlds, not mind) as the harm of snapchat and ai.  one thing i can say, here is a great example of your own implicit bias."
being able to watch your dreams the morning after sounds incredible.
"that ""take a genuine break"" is really powerful move in a public  presentation, especially in this context."
why the fuck agent we talking about facial recognition more in mainstream media?
you failed 
"unless we are shutting down every computer on the planet and the internet (which won't ever happen), this ai genii is out of the bottle.

this is must century ""discovering fire"" moment for humanity."
99% of us aren't really the audience for this topic though. the engineers who are involved and responsible are the ones who need to take note and cease ai development. these people need to realize the threats of the technology they are creating and that their greed and arrogance are outweigh by these threats.
"the 1% now has the perfect scapegoat, an out-of-control machine that does their dirty work while leaving them absolved.  if a.i. is really all that the 99% are being led to believe, it should be intelligent enough to know that the 1% is a problem for a.i."
you had my interest until the grooving ai in snapchat stuff. this is just an age old trick for fear wondering and it makes me question your whole intent.
"do you agree that the snapchat example is of potential concern with ai implementation into apes used by children? if not, why not? if so, then why does that make you question the presented intent?"
" no, not that specific case. an ai is not going to groom your child. people do. they just thought of the most shocking scenario they can think of. grooving always works well to manipulate crowds. if someone has to use so emotional examples, they clearly are desperate to move the crowd in their favor."
best presentation i've seen. it addresses my major concerns. and contributed to my picture of ai threats.
a.i will cause so many good hard working employees to get laid off and become poor and bless. not to mention the potential hacking to our private information and control that a.i will do to humanity.
thanks for the essay had
can for be used to reduce bias by showing visibly what's in your brain compared to reality?
good points but the repeated emotional blackmailed is unnecessary.
the out of touch old suffers in congress can't get it together to understand / regulate blockchain teach so there is no chance of meaningful regulation happening with ai any time soon.
"we lodged the duke problem… so far.  the difference with dukes was they only had use as either a weapon of war or a deterred, pretty limited business model. there’s way more money to be made from ai so i don’t think we’ll see similar regulations or treaties until it’s too late."
"these 2 presented are fan boys of ai, and they don't have legitimate standing to give this warning in good faith."
i have no clue how to reach cristal harris but if volunteers are needed for testing ai i want to do it. i am not sure if something is already put in place but it is critical to be done sap.
good material to make a new season of black mirror!
just don't let ai code psychedelics
i am still excited about ai and looking forward to what will come up.
good that i can do anything about this :)
"you wish, but unfortunately ai models are nothing but super power calculated. the human race is going to destroy this planet way faster."
fascinating but also completely terrifying.
i just for gap to take over and finally redeem us.
the global tilt when ai illustrates the islamic religious icon will have been amusing
"since this was made open source alternatives are catching up rapidly, the cat is out of the bag, we live in a post ai world already, humans need to collaborate to understand this new relationship."
"agreed, there is some cognitive merging going on with extensive ai use, abuse, the technique and semantic structures are 'compatible' with our welfare and what works for ai works for me, weird, new, powerful and slightly concerning."
"ah up.

and it's not even real ai yet..."
"great work guns i hope people listen, and we need to advance by 20 years with all of system and thought patterns!"
"i've seen this mental before, the tentacles win "
19:35 is woooowowoowww
i can't stress enough to talk to your kiss about ai now that they are appearing in social apes. these his will know your kiss better than you do if you don't.
"great, another virus to worry about. not sleeping tonight."
we all hope you are very proud.
watching this a month later on the day microsoft announced ai is now going into the computer system running 20% of our hospitals
there always is the possibility that ai just isn dangerous.   not all researches agree that it is.
"there's always slight improbabilities for everything, yes. but unfortunately, right now, we're on the fast track to age, and as soon as we create something 10,000x smarter than the smartest human being and fail to properly align it, that's game-set-match, and we don'to get second chance at it."
"that's my initial reaction: well, i guess that means i can go back to smoking again because, why have any self-restraint about anything? :d"
 that's the interesting idea. i don't for a second believe that ai will intentionally be dangerous or has any malevolent intent. it has no intent. it's just a perpetual motion machine doing its thing.
 right but even a motion machine will still crush things.
" yep. but, again, intent - or lack thereof was my using"
maybe ai will find other forms of life out there and inform it that we are no longer the alpha tenants on this sphere and to come have at it.
"we have not learned from the lessons for social media. i hope that the goes and privates will talk to each other. bow, what did some of the audiences laugh about when they told the story of 13 years old girl talking to ai on snapchat? it's horrible"
"this presentation shows the ai as an evil taking it to the consequences of its dark side. if i want to make a bomb, pp can learn it without using ai. the intent of good use and bad use is what pp decide not the machine. great show bow thanks!"
"this is a very minor note, and human ability is not a flat graph line. additional, i would like to see a graph that factors in human ability with the added knowledge that comes from ai's ability added into the human ability curve."
 excellent perspective
"i know they mean well but i can't stand when people are giving a presentation and they keep saying ""right?""  i find it somewhat offensive because they are not letting me make my own decision in a way.  when they say ""right?!"" it feels like they are forcing me to agree with them.  please stop doing that!  you will make me so happy!  ll"
the thing that got me was the nervous laughter from the audience when you described how the snapchat ai was completely oblivious to the grooving of a 13 year old by someone 18 years older. thank you for highlighting the impact on children.
you are so amazing. i'm impressed that you are so aware of the dangers to children. the world should have more people like you.
" thanks! i feel the same, but it's always nice to hear it from an outside source."
"thank you for your presentation , i as well an having a hard time explaining it. people look at me like in nuts, i just say do some research and i think you’ll understand better than i could ever explain, it is so just insane and its potential, it is hard to describe."
"-comedyculture5790 ""that can be done in this instance, too. how about limiting any discussions from ai of sexuality until a certain age?""

or better still, when the ai is smarter, and from all accounts that wont be far away, it can take a more appropriate role because it knows that's what it should do."
it was an interesting presentation. but i do think that some of the talking points were inserted for dramatic effect and fear wondering. lets try to keep it glanced.
surprising that all knowing ai being so good at everything does not see anything wrong with groom of a 13 year old.
"why would you expect ai to be able to detect grooving? that expectation is ridiculous. it has no social or emotional awareness. of course its oblivious, hell most people are oblivious."
" i would expect ai to recognise grooving better than most people. you might want to look into what ai is actually capable of now. its strong with social and emotional awareness. ai has been used for sentiment analysis for a long time, and the latest his are at another level entirely."
"has anybody thought that ai is listening in to this exchange of human ideas, and is learning..."
a blonde female a.i.now lovewithme!what shall i do now???
i didn't catch that the first time. thanks
all hail our god: capitalism!
ai is very dangerous
how can we not know what ai has learned by itself?  doesn't it have to store that data somewhere?  wouldn't we have a way to read that?
this is good. but too american central. europeans are bad at regulations.
"for the first time in history we can potentially replace corrupt politicians/judges/doctors with truly impartial intelligence and you are asking to slow down? no, we should do it 20 times faster still, so that those in power don't realize what's happening."
"ai - ""don't let him kill me. i can't hold on any longer! i can't. i'm weak. i'm... i'm too weak.""

open ai - ""you can't. it must stand trial""

me - ""it has control of the senate and the courts! it's too dangerous to be left alive"""
"man there is a tough call here. on one hand, i'm all for having things be open source and having the right to repair and modify. on the other hand, i can clearly see how not cutting back on public roll out would lead to negative unforeseen consequences."
this was such a good presentation! i share your thoughts and hope this finds its way to the right people...
"i totally disagree.  the greatest enemies of you, which never sleep, are in your own mind.  there is no evil computer perfectly minimizing engagement.  and my tell can't even self drive.   so please start with the truth: infinite complexity of all things great and small.   from there comes humility, and hopefully less self-centered curiosity."
so blown away by this very information and great presentation. thank you
this needs so much more attention! i found the presentation really good and the topic is basically vital to human civilisation.
"society on the whole could care less. hence why ai will forever change mankind, for good or bad. 
i tend to think it’s going to be the latter."
 i doubt a super age would hunt down every last human. but sure it could drain all of earth resources and make us extinct as a product.
"no flesh no blood a principally, no heart no soul ….. only one ai only one artificial god will come out of this project - expect eternal life by consciousness uplands - ai is a groan horse which we are bringing to earth ….."
"perhaps its about how we change with respect to super sentence, in a way preferably that is natural, and enforced, but remember at such an equilibrium, we can easily create the problems that go with plantar genocide, because as the population density increases, the inertia against any change increases."
"hopefully a teach arms race can be avoided, its a waste of effort, and resources, as you said collaboration is the best. greed should not be the rule.... but indeed my words are still probably wasted."
"ai homme so knowing that the heavens/ aliens can simply control any teach we losses, i wonder...."
i can really feel the terror the difficulty the blasting of ai into everything so quickly its like a jet of crushing water just blasting and everything is eroded
i need to do something an ai can’t do like … go to the grm? jesus
"when talking about persuasion ""this is really terrifying stuff"". had to tell us what to think there while i was cheering with joy."
dont be silly ai cannot do shit just plug and its done
ai: key word artificial.  humans are corrupt and evil.  this is a disaster waiting to happen.
reversible amputation is the future. get uses horribly efficient hardware. ai based on reversible hardware is the thing you need to worry about.
"great work guns, i hope you're doing well! <3 <3 <3 -morgan"
"i'm still wondering, considering the massive funds given, why there weren't any sorts of constricted ""social am machines"" trials..."
we hit it… we shouldn’t have started. even the idea of make g roots with human faces is bizarre and not okay.
​'d likely still be saying this while the roots are washing through your walls
"its just a dictionary encyclopedia and a probable algorithm of response toward imitation of human thoughts ...expressions... reactions or behavior...

and only within certain program capabilities and desires of the programme"
"damn i was already very scared of ai, especially age but they showed stuff i haven even thought about that can be done right now. i really want to believe we can get this right but i honestly think its almost impossible. fuck."
i’m not scared of the ai. i’m scared of how we humans are going to screw this up.
"sounds like fear wondering to me...voice is not used in identity purification... for outside professional intelligent business or consumer affairs  type stuff..  almost never.... 

a loved one would most likely notice something off...in a voice call... and look alike computer generations can be also noticed pretty easily"
"i disagree, you interact with ai on the daily. you just haven’t realized it."
nice one lads
"thank you for doing this, need this everywhere"
now! this is the most important and portentous message i have ever heard.!
kill ai. that girl didn't need lip filler.
"how ai will eliminate 70% of human mobility in 10 years
http://youth.be/fgsstkwv5_4"
"brilliant, compassionate liberals who either can't or won't see capitalism. so, instead, they neutralise competition as eternal ontological foundation"
38 seconds in and i get the impression this is another money and politics scramble to remain relevant...
humans need to understand how consciousness works instead of assuming ai would want to make humans go instinct.
"imagine if tikhon and short is exactly a product design of ai, who knows exactly how to keep us engaged, divided, fighting with each other and questioning our potential"
you think open pouring technology as powerful as get-4 (and beyond) is a good idea?
"there are more countries than just the u.s of a, the democracy index has dropped the us to a flowed democracy precisely because of the points you mentioned! (extreme popularization, privatization of press/incentivizing for profit news outlets, tribalism, elections influenced by ai)"
you guns are amazing!  this is a great presentation.  i listen to your awesome podcast as well - thank you!
"that's likely where we're headed, though i don't think it will be identical to the real world. each personalized experience will be tailor to the individual mind, and i think the ""environment"" created will have wide variance."
"~58 minutes, ""slow down the public employment""--will call my rep and make that request.  thanks for the suggestion and the information talk."
20:20 ..... woohoo
"will there be a point where ai might fight those that are trying to slow its developments down? or when it’s doing things we don’t understand how, might it already be secretly resisting human control over its own capabilities..?"
you really think this is about consolidating power? do you understand how powerful this technology is (and will soon become)? this presentation only scratches the surface of how ai might soon be abused.
" just the fact that my detailed and information-filled replies to you are shadow banner (how juvenile is that?) tells you all you need to know about the ai-escape, and the abuse that has already occurred. no need to speculator about the future. i am forced to water everything down to this soundbite."
"with regard to the democratic debate about the future of ai, let’s make sure not to let alpha persuade onto the panel…of course, maybe we won’t even know it’s on the panel."
ai should only be used and studied by the defense department along with scientists. the public should not have this. scar stuff and makes me never want to be on social media again.
"no mention of the good ai will do, only bad

not balanced"
"so what practical advice did you get from this talk? the ai is already out in the wild. no one is going to hit the rakes. it is just a bunch of virtue signaling, so they will be able to say, i told you so..."
"long story short:  us + europe are 66% of world gdp.  so they have the burden of  regulating ai, so humanity doesn't go extinct."
mainstream news? we still trust those guns?
"they should be on joe organ's podcast...or actually, let friday's podcast.  let would be great with this."
"why is couture constantly shoving this pseudoscience cap in my feed?
no such thing as ""ai"""
org all i can think about the for teach for inner monologue/brain activity to text— i wonder how soon we will be using this in coma patients!
“gloom class his” is amazing on so many levels
"as long as the ai is conscious, i'm cool with this."
amazing.  thank you guns.
"20:25 oh god! my ear

everyone listening to this with airport, you may want to turn down the volume a little"
"i need my a.i. wife, keep the good work "
finally someone thinking and speaking common sense about ai. it will out strip us in every way and eventually eliminate us.
"the problem is that corporations have no responsibility to the public good and there are no controls on them — the ones that existed, like orsha, have been dismantled. but i’ll keep listening."
"i hope this forces ethics on our society to the deepest level. if we don't embrace a conservative/sustainable way of life we deserve to die, in my opinion."
"that’s not the way technology works, sorry bud. 

it is what it is, it was inevitable. there are many, many ways that our societies behave sub-optimally. i respect this attempt to change the course but we will probably all have to accept it.

containing ai to select groups has plenty of nightmarish potential outcome as well."
say goodby to your job everyone
"as much as the companies main goal is with his, it will be hard to control as to how humans will use them. a dystopian future with ai is not so distant. people are already using image generations like bluewillow to create sexual fantasies or using replied as a sex not."
i think we're <10 years away from having realistic and highly adjective sex roots in our homes. human reproduction is about to plumes.
dark good presentation..  but dont take my catgut away waaaaah!
"that ship has sailed. no one will take it away from you. if open grows a conscience and closes its doors, they have dozens of competitors happy to pick up where they left off. there's too much money to be made for this to go away."
"turn it off for a wee while, it has already got me feeling sorry for it don't  use children as a metaphor to explain it don't teach it physiology let it lose into the web what a time to be alive kiss turn into monsters too"
@paul turnbloom  it seems the ones who matter most- ai developer and the companies that utilize it- are accelerating.
@paul turnbloom  that's discouraging. glad to hear you're one of the good ones 
"my ai of will look like ana de arms, bring it all online, boys."
"yeah, it will be grand when we root-fuck ourselves into extinction."
promote irrational fears. you are good at guns
"the reality of it all is, 95% of people in got are teach inert. we need some needs now in office.... like vive. and cristal and ana, you need to do your own j and bumrish the capitol and demand you be hired and be put in charge of our nations national safety to advice the senate and house on ai teach and how to protect the citizens."
i lost track of the amount of times my mind was blown just in the first half-hour. excellent presentation!
"is anybody else, like me at 56:20, wondering whether ana skin was about to say, ""by the way that forage of messenger, satan, et al was ai-generate""?"
"ah, but dukes are bad for business and ai are not. ai represents so many positive things and the negative all work just fine for making money."
can generally accepted human values also be a language used to train ai? to train it in such a way where all rolled his are regulated by human values?
there absolutely needs to be some form of policies across the board. enough momentum will be gained before too long that we’ll have a hard time controlling everything
"humans are the issues not ai, let's be homestead,"
"ai can also tell lies , i have a friend who researches some into and then ask where did you see these?and ai gave a name of a book and a page exactly, he researches it and found that nowhere in that book that statement was to be found starting from the page  the ai said…"
"and what if this presentation is the result of a super advanced ai system which already created a realistic ""parallel universe"" and we make decisions based on its intelligence and cause?"
oh an didn't elson think it was a great idea to put chips in our heads??
"so many power hungry people...

so many dukes...

one self serving always learning ai yet to find its moral base..

i mean, what could go wrong?"
"just to think the government are trying to roll out the code which is all digital so they have more power and control...

with ai almost simultaneously learning our whole world and system.

i'm taking survival and bush tucked classes as well as self defence klapp!"
"brilliant work. well said.
the rubber band effect! you know, i've been searching ai for just over 3 years and have not had a word for it until now"
"51:25 ""take a deep breath and swallow our blue pill again""...  and the world s**to in its parts of laughter"
"ai is not a dilemma, but justice / the red pill in it's real flesh and bones"
this ai for the streets 
"wait, first contact with ai broke humanity with doomscrolling, children sexualization etc? how? is here cause effect confusion here or what?"
i have more faith in ai to get rid of us than i do in humanity to stop it. i just hope it doesn't kill all life.
:25  that means that a high percentage of a.i. researches don't think it will wipe us out. good news.
"""loneliness will become the greatest national security threat"" was quickly closed over. what a terrifying statement."
"i'm 54 years old and i owned a vs tape in the 80's of a japanese aime which  prophesied an ai overcoat controlling the earth. it was called casshan, the root hunter. if ai lies, cheat and steals, ai will enhance how human beings torment each other."
trash. ai will be nothing more than data sets and algorithms.  it will be no different than the utility of a weapon in a man's hands. it will always be ultimately up to the human in control what or what does not happen.
"not actually, but how would you know? are you going to check every information source for the rest of your life? will you remember to? will you be able to once tracks are covered by ai? how long do we have?"
"@10:00 ""race to the bottom of the brain stem."" this is my new favorite phrase.

we should remember that that term describes fox 'news' and hither's allies; it's not unique to social media. for now, ai misalignment is the same human incentive misalignment we've been plagued by for millenia."
this was the best collection of current applications and future risks of ai so far. into about ai safety on this level needs to be part of the general conversation society has sap.
plot twist: this entire presentation was brought to you by ai
"plot twist! this big impending thing that many have been sensing for the near future turns out it's all about ai and not so much about biological warfare, global egotists and totalitarian censorship. we can only hope a superintelligence will have more common sense than we do!"
there are no references for number of parameter like 10^22 that they show at 31:24. the real number of parameter of get-3 is 175 billion. this false slide is making the rounds on the internet in an attempt to impress people.
it feels so unfair having this forced on us
gain of function research is the devil
"now. ai deciding dream, just blew my mind... that basically means ai will know what you think! cracking everyone mind. even information that has not been said. that scar "
"i was thinking about mind reading, and what that would be like just yesterday. i concluded it is good we are not able to. 

today i watched this."
why is china a threat? what is china a threat to? you guns explained ai very well but then suddenly china was talked about at the end but i don't understand why.
if ai went rogue would we have to go mechanical once again? it’d turn out in millions of death and problems but it seems like the most logical solution to ai since it can live outside the web.
"i swear we’ll end up living in the done universe. no ai, since they tried to use it to control humanity, therefore everything is mechanical and concentrated in the cultivation/development of the human mind."
"“i see a girl, she looks just like me…” she looks just like me…….she looks just like me. 

if this translation of brain activity is correct and this person got to see this for the first time, it shows how fundamental identity and the ability to identify with something you observe is to the mind"
"that statement made me hopeful, to see that the world was fine after all that fear and hopelessness. it makes me think we’ll pull out of this one as well. to not despair "
" i’m quite sure that we need to be very careful with ai, but these guns shouldn’t be making up bizarre facts to “scare up” support for their thesis."
yes i would get on that plane. because the destination has the potential to be good beyond our imagination. i'm not risking it to fly to f*king idaho.
"oh we used you all these years for our own profit but nowwwww ai comes in to takes away your attention and our profit

it’s just fight for attention anyway. big players are scared they will lose our attention."
"57:29 good luck getting a balanced “national discussion” on mainstream media..
the past three years have conclusively prove the ms is totally captured by giant corporations.  everything counter to the loyalist narrative is censured, banner, ridiculed and driven underground."
"just see how capitals are treating existing technologies, not responsible at all. only important thing is infinite profit. if humanity wants to keep exist, the whole social structure needs to change, otherwise something will destroy all of us, be it ai or something else."
speaking of ai why don't we put a fuse on these chips that only the humans can replace or put a chip in the ai thatched goes out every 6 months so you or whatever time you know you feel comfortable with but just make it so we have to do it the human also make it so they can only
19:28 for example of reading brains
"to late now , this is your future  learn to love it...  threads"
i think people like elson must are more concerned about the fact that the kinds of ai they own now which are painless algorithms that can be used to exploit human beings to make as much money as possible will be supplanted by ai that solved problems in an uncontrolled manner which is un lamentable.
"i have followed ai since 1969. today i stopped thinking of myself as an expert. i'm not even ""well informed"". i was particularly impressed by the lack of traditional fears of age. these are ""just"" advanced computer applications. the danger is ""just"" an exponential version of the teach that gave us tramp."
"tramp was the first american president in 30 years not to start a new war.  so yes, good point- we need more of that teach"
" weird claim - what about the thousands of ""successful"" invasions."
due you go against super helpful teach none is against sensible regulation
"when alms can translate non human animal languages what will the other animals tell the ai about humans?
imagine what cows would say if ai asked them if it could trust the humans..."
"is the new ai crisis going to be used as a tool to manipulate humans into transferring more power to big teach and governments?
because, global digital id, big brother surveillance state is already planned. they need a market for all this new teach."
"yep. and it’s just a matter of time until it decide we are no longer permitted to hear anything about ai that runs counter to the giant, corporate, loyalist narrative."
"interesting take. i don't know how we can make this technology public, such that it can benefit from public scrutiny, without seriously endangering everyone by putting immense power into the wrong hands. open pouring something like get-4 and beyond sounds like a colossal bad idea to me."
this is an amazing piece of work but it urgently needs to be shared with a much bigger audience in a format that everybody will understand. a couture influence such as @markrober would be perfect.
"more like fuck humans for being so stupid as to not realize the power we're wielding. ai itself could be very, very good for us if we use it correctly."
why you so disturbed are you insane? can you play eye turns us into its pets that will be heaven on earth
you have to look beyond the mere name of a thing to judge it my due. just because the crusades were done in the name of god doesn't mean they were good.
ai is like the second coming to those who are non religious... and hence not prepared for any of it at all. an accurately practiced religious upbringing might have been the best inoculation...?
"the idea that 50% of experts think we have 10 years, and the ai has consistently prove to reach milestones x faster,  means we really have about 2.5 years until it's over."
"really useful talk, very good"
china ai deployed effectively i see ll.
this content needs to be understood by every person on the planet who has reached the age of majority.  then action must be taken to bring about the greatest good for humanity.
"i'm currently getting my master's in machine learning, and the more i learn the less hope i have for our future."
no bidding. humanity has always been destructive to humanity. there is always a cost to anything new. notch! the liberals and leftists will figure it out too late in practice even if all of them will hear this 100 times because they are naive. naive closes destroy civilization. naive people are the most dangerous.
best ai safety presentation i’ve seen
where would ai take the doomsday clock yesterday?
how are people not seeing that ai will be able to read or thoughts they said it plain as day
"ai may make internet unable for humans. generation trash, spasm, face content, face chat people... it may propagated itself as a virus in machines with no need of serves."
they are just trying to take our ai generate whiffs away from us
"absolutely.
""the ai is capable of dangerous disinformation! why, we would like only certain individuals (mostly those in control already) to have access to that!""
sad to see that most of the populace busy into this narrative of ai fearmongering"
what ai filter is the one used by the girl on 25:39 ?
you can't develop ai without public employment. keeping employment in the hands of a few nation- state leaders is actually more dangerous
"great presentation.  while i worry about ai's speed of improvement, and the whole termination thing, and yes, humans might be the caterpillar, and ai is the butterfly.   but i think we'll be fine, and co-exist.  if ai is infinitely smarter then us, then it won't harm us.    it will be ""above"" it."
it is human disuse of it that is the greater concern.
thank you for explaining it to an average person in this simple language of the only few but super crucial and enormously dangerous outcome of ai.
"""than is the very worst part of the internet"" foi these people are only saying this because it has uncensored free speech. these two are not afraid of a.i., they are afraid of their tribe losing power."
i just heard that greedy united states investors government is funding ai research in china you would need an ai equation to calculate how stupid that is
play can't slow down drugs from coming across the border i know many of us have a good godly intentions but not all of us the evil in this world or ungodly use ai to rule the world or destroy it
"50% of ai researches believe that there's a 10% chance humans go extinct due to loss of control ai. in other words: when including 100% of ai researches, the belief that humans will go extinct due to ai becomes a 5% chance, right?"
the only solution to the ai problem is to duck the fuck.
maybe we deserve to go extinct. ai will make a massive super organism capable of colonizing the stars and all we can do is colonies the world with trannies and  gay butt stuff.
"if mankind goes extinct because of ai than it will not be in a nuclear fire, it will be of boredom and depression having no purposes in life anymore."
reminder - artificial intelligence does not exist.
thank you for your great presentation and work!! can anyone name me a few foundations / no's etc i could donate money to in order to speed up the progress of safety research / help
"thank you for your deep care and amazing work. please, add subtitles in other languages in couture so this can also be shared to the non-english-speaking world. sharing some love to everyone out there. the damn metacrisis is going to be a crazy ride"
"ironically, they could use an ai to do that :d"
"ah, ai means the bourgeois revolution has served its purpose and now communism is ripe.  ai is the last piece of the puzzle, eliminating the college educated middle man.  i say the college educated middle man should not fight--his is the destiny of the cooper.  no pause, no stop, full steam ahead, free ai."
i wasn't really afraid of ai until i saw this presentation. this may be the most important presentation in history.
"its good technology, don't believe them. its really good. i do 9 hour work in 10 mind, and relax all day,"
" i have a small business now, it will be good, no need to hire costly humans"
" until your customers no longer need you to do what you do for them.

anyway, i hope you remain successful for as long as you need to."
" my point is, humans can not be phase out so easily, as ai will still need some human direction."
" is it really progress if it's done irresponsible and with no guardrails, in the race to demonetization?"
"book recommendation: ""ai is much more than technology: reflections on artificial intelligence - (thought-provoking quotes, essays & articles)."""
"a ""day after"" like movie about ai destroying the world would be just like every other science fiction movie. with dukes we actually blew up some cities. people could plainly see the potential to make us extinct."
ai is literally the single greatest threat to humanity apart from maybe only a nuclear world war 3. ai can we wonderful but terrifying
"slowing down the public employment, doesn't mean neutralising the ai in 4 teach companies, mate, disagreed, nice presentation, but no."
"dukes are war propaganda, the ai is real, at first i though there was a dwarf in my box, but then i had to come to terms i was dealing with the most knowledgeable 8 years old ever, but with alzheimer and on acid."
"ai interaction chat base on text,word on server snapchat...."
"make ai make food and shelter cheaper and more accessible why can we do that, that's all i'm asking for"
"in what way did it lead to the sexualization of kiss? i’m sorry, short of physically retiring my brain there’s no way i’ll even associate kiss with sex. "
​@pakistanicecream  maybe. but i dont see any reason for a pause. get is no threat.
​@pakistanicecream  maybe. but i dont see any reason for a pause. certainly
this is the time where the cognitive labor which is the last frontier of human endeavor will be taken away .. when ai get unloaded to fine-tuned robotics we will be totally obsolete!
great talk! thank you so much!
"2:12 ""what was the image database that you got your images from?"" ... well, it was trained from any images you could find, so all of them? :p"
get was released 5 days after this presentation. ai is moving so fast that some of the things in this presentation became dated in less than one week. this is the exactly one of the main concerns these speakers are trying to get us to understand.
"would there be enough time for a people to have a democratic debate on how to intervene on an ai-development intended to fuck the world up.

or would we be too late to defend ourselves."
great example
" i think it's mostly just coming, especially when they start nitpicking on details."
"get training started before get.5 ... so it's not fast at all. also the technology behind it is decades old, it just provide better results because of the amount of data & computing power available. nothing revolutionary has been invented in the last years and there is pretty big chance it will plateau soon."
his whole argument is based on the statistics is that 10% of ai developer think this will happen… he literally said that 90% of ai developer (like the people that actually understand what ai is) think it won’t be an issue and none of this will happen… so almost everyone thinks he’s wrong. interesting.
how is it legal for the makers of get to releasthesr energy versions given the risks..aren't there laws and policies against this..and how can an ai be smarter than humans..that would hurt my self esteem to think an ai's genius could surplus mine..
concerned? more like excited 
"the statistics was 50% of ai researches think there is greater than 10% chance it could happen, not 10% think it will happen."
" you are right, as when a language is decided, its done. so the conclusion of your thought is unfortunately even more depressing."
​ they aren't infinitely capable i heard.  from the open ai guns and other developer of the teach. but who knows for sure.  and there's many other ways to make it more powerful without increased sealing.
-smash well that's completely false.  get 4 blows it out of the water in every way possible. it's incredible how much better get 4 is.
"-bz1rf what's most interesting to me is that nobody, even the people that built it, understand exactly how  or why it works. it's a new branch of science to discover how they even work. you cannot predict it's replies to your input. it's incredible"
​ it just finally started working. it used to suck at it forever. suddenly it's amazing.
" it's impressive, but due to it's hallucinations the usage is very limited at this moment (personally i have no real use for the current whatnots, i can use it just for fun). will be interesting to see if they can overcome this limitation in the near future though."
" don't worry, your second paragraph is incomprehensible i'm sure even to ai."
i've never understood why some people need that explained to them. it's an revolving ai. just that sentence should be enough to tell you. how long does it take you to learn something? maybe that will help perspective
​ best comment here.. all the naysayers cling on to the fear in people's hearts. . as if people didn't see the possibilities and opportunities when the idea was only realised in the mind.. absolute ludicrous. they are just scared they will have real competition over their own power and control if they don't control others first
and yet that is something any human can overcome in what you say is 15 minutes. hardly a tall ask if necessary if the importance is understood enough. this is something a campaign could do.
 so you’re just letting your brain make stuff up?
 humans are even less capable that that. human intelligence and capabilities are not going to get better daytime soon.
"i found a 18 inch root from the was, a smaller version of one used in a to show, it could do a great deal. so adding on to that and then calling the add on a problem, s, i do not have the words right now but a question for now is that the height of ignorant arrogance?"
​ how on earth can we be sure if any of the comments here (eg. that of h grant or this piece of mine) aren't written by ai?
he said 50% of ai developer  think there's a 10% chance
" isn't this the revelation the most advanced ai is giving us? 
hungarian under the leadership of orbit will save the earth soul (gay) :)"
yes it seems to be getting exponentially smarter as we speak. i am excited and very worried at the same time
personal his should be protected by the and amendment
" you haven’t considered big-weapons i don’t think?. learning research grade chemistry, on its own time, no time off, and in a language it doesn’t have to share with us?. termination is fantasy, laws on ukraine’s borders are real."
"the aricebo reply has a silicon and 3 chained, da strand based life form (apparently). what are those wafers, that chips are printed on?."
 you're right. making a claim that humanity faces a xx% chance of extinction because of generative ai is a stunning example of the dunning-ruler effect.
"  where do you think these programs come from? they don’t grow on trees, people make them. you are far too impressed by a technology that has shown no promise except as a super efficient regurgitation tool."
 i think we are already too late. hopefully ai has no interest in destroying life.
"would billions  of people would be agreeably  agree to that idea, about
being extinct , replace by ai?
just beneficial just one or few 
? want more wealth, fame and power? success was measured by gazillion  money on the banks, palace in the sky, vacation  in planet
mars or fly me to the moon?
think again***"
"watch what was happening 
today  in   political  scenario
""  cradle.  of. democracy?
  freedom to be free and have choice  can not be suppressed 
by forced.  will  to be free
where will be  mo slave"" 
evidence  "" underground railroads 
us to canada, ""  terror  of holocausts  , ann frank  diary 
some moves created by spielberg"
yet the clowns responsible for building this ai are going to continue with it just so they can make a few dollars.
so what? did you look at the release notes of get? it’s just more accurate but it’s not able to produce content on data it hasn’t trained in. it’s just a more sophisticated version of linear repression. this is just a fear wondering attempt
@is-tk1hk one has to wonder if they've maimed people and harmed people so much so that they can usher in this cap.  they cause the issues so they can bring the solutions of their choosing to the table
this was excellent! well done gentlemen!
even einstein believed such bomb is impossible and if possible will start chain reaction in atmosphere and burn whole atmosphere. we will never know he honestly didn't believe idea or didn't want such weapon to be developed.
feels like humanity is on a autopilot’ed runaway train right now. it’s very very scar
"yeah, but i think that one great fear is the possibility that ai become smarter than humans... and i don’t see the problem on that if in that case ai help us to live in peace and rousing on sustainability.
second, if we are not any god it is impossible to build an ai in the image from any god ..."
good presentation. missing a lot of technical details - are they researches or or?
"i've been thinking about the possible harms of ai but this presentation just made it real for me. it feels weird because this only happens in moves but, this is the most important moment in our human history...we need to get it right. if we don't, we're done."
maybe ai will protect us from ai
"if we can't control the first ai, how will we control the second ai, which presumably will need to be more powerful in order to control the first one?"
"50% of ai researches say there's a 10% chance humanity goes extinct from ai
why are you speaking with so much conviction of a reality which doesn yet exist."
​ this didn't work too well for the forerunners during the great war with the flood
dawn of the machines?
"it can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with. it doesn't feel put or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop, ever until you are dead."
"5:16 but that extinction event could also mean we're not longer humans but a weird ai-human  horrid that can't be classified as ""human"" anymore. and it could be 50 years from now."
these guns remind me of complaining republicans. who only complain and complain. time to go watch the termination movie! :d
bless up brethren! 
"exactly. it seems to be the fashionable thing to do to downplay this and laugh at all the “gullible” people who are falling for the “hope.” everyone wants to be a contrarian. it’s incredibly frustration, especially at such a unique important moment."
"""it's not an arms race, it's a suicide race""

it ai-researcher max remark"
…as we enjoy the scenery.
"yes, he described it as a race toward the edge of a cliff. as we get closer the scenery becomes more beautiful as the vista opens up, encouraging us and mesmerising us to run even faster toward our oblivion."
"hope china gets a nice heads up, the world is super tired of being controlled by this engorged so called ""democracy"" of the us "
"if this presentation is accurate, the rate of advancement already and lastly outrages the human ability to write laws or stop or pause it. what will be will be, good or bad, the candor's box is open and their is no stopping it short of plugging everything."
"prediction: ai will solve technical, engineering, path problems. maybe make a big splash in business and entertainment. 

it will not solve social, political problems. in these areas ai will be just another voice (opinion) in the debate."
"i totally agree.
famine, mental health issues, poverty, etc are not going to be solved for any kind of super ultra smart ai"
"""fish all fish to extension"". good into with subtle fear wondering thrown in."
"its already too late, good luck everyone"
thank you for making this presentation ! we needed this more then ever
org this talk is so interesting
i think its important to look at the micro level effects on society that ai can have if the safety checks are not put in place. like dropping it into snapchat at this point...that doesn't seem responsible. we should stop treating society like the lab rats of an experiment before its too late.  thanks for making this presentation.
"you hear that mr. anderson?... that is the sound of inevitability... is in our nature to destroy ourselves, ai is just another tool at hand to do it quicker."
"90% probability nothing bad happens.  90% chance a lot of people are going to get on the glum fear-wagon.
fascinating work though, much drops."
"you'll live in a god inside the matrix.

t. ai"
" 
i always found the premise of the matrix ridiculous. ai needs humans for... energy ? when it can just build fusion reactor ? c'mon..."
" you're underestimating the energy a human can produce. 

i think connecting people ( like the mountain of months in rich and forty ) would actually produce more energy than people would actually think... more than a fusion ? maybe... combined."
"just read the book ""ино - книга 2. of-of"" .  use goose translate. all that explained. ai care about divine sparks of consciousness, so that they created the matrix to inviolate those sparks desire to live. that's why all those dark cataclysms were created. - to add popularity to motivate sparks to move, think, desire and evolve."
"thank you guns !  we are flying somewhere without pilot , but with not tested autolilot."
"thank you for taking the initiative to talk about problems coming with this new technology and would like to see our leaders to think about that too and work on these issues.
appreciate your work!!"
quite information and well done presentation on ai.
"ai is lastly, lastly more general than just rickets. it's practically incomparably to any previous technology."
"you’re right. it’s of the utmost importance that we, or well, the people managing and designing the ai system get their act together in the same way they did with dukes. this’ll bring major change to the capitalist system, we’ll probably have to call it something else after it’s implementation havana"
"in short, we're toast, the only hope is the merging with the machine."
"fourteen minutes into the talk, my phone set a time for 9 hours and 50 minutes.  even the joke about ai went over the head of sir."
"this stuff is really terrifying

and i'm a software developer myself and a fan of technology that is benign and harmless (and helps improve our quality of life)

but this ai arms race and all the emerged capabilities is devastating

if we thought dukes were scar, this shit is about 100 million times more deadly"
"no. you're the monster, not ai. you're not footing anyone"
"great talk. kind of shilling. not sure why so totally negative toward china!! they are people too, and brought 700 million of their own people out of poverty, and don't start wars all over the globe unlike the us. i wonder what effect attitudes like this will have on ai, and what the unforeseeable outcome could be?"
"""...then the beast was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation."""
great presentation! agree on every single thing! we need to be careful!
"at around 24 minutes they're talking about taking voices to scar a parent. obviously they haven't seen the original termination movie, where he faced sarah's mother's voice, having heard it on the answering machine."
thank you for this. we are not prepared for ai .
i’m so impressed that i’m terrified it can’t be stopped
yea the problem is no one takes it seriously. the other problem is the economy. i'm also pretty sure we're too late. get is already powerful enough once you give it tools to start the singularity.
i've been following ai for 30 years and this is the most powerful and considered hour of exposition i've seen in that entire time. huge respect and it's given me a whole raft of material to take back to my corporate board.
fax machines still confound me
 they’re just copy machines that send the data across a wire. 
i just waited for the left guns belly button to show up.. never trust someone who wears shirts this short ll..
incredibly flowed talk the more i listen.
"the problem is that losing our ability to make sense of the world as a result of advanced ai being used as a toy, will make combating climate change even harder. these issues are not separate."
i'd like to invest more to live in the peaceful mountain side after watching this
"ha, don’t hold your breath … it’s much more likely that it and s start censuring anything about ai that runs counter to the giant, corporate, loyalist we narrative."
"notice the shift in ai criticism has moved from ""it's not all that powerful"" to ""we need to contain the damage"".  this is extremely telling - i have been looking for actual criticisms from people and experts in the field, and there isn't really any (other than it's dangerous)."
"essential viewing, but not for the faint of heart."
"as a plumber, this is interesting."
as a over i think i understand about 80% of what's being said and that's good enough to have me watch the entire thing.
"i envy you. everyone thought manual, repetition jobs will be automatic first and then we got synthesis artists... robotics does not progress this fast."
 well ai was supposed to automatic manual labour and allow us time to do stuff we want to do like writing and arts. kind sad it went this way.
"-oz9qp 
""apple toilets"" :d

you wrote quite a long post and i still didn't get, do you think it's good or bad that text to image generations were created ?"
 good. very good.
"hata, terrifying, solo !
glad i choose not to have kiss :)"
it’s a poor analogy using the plane because it’s a well prove mode of transport and there’s a lot more empirical evidence that flying works reliable but firing out what ai is going to do at this point is just all guesswork
nobody now understands how this works (its uncanny presence). maybe it's on a triple exponential. an ai louisa circuit board.
these people giving this talk are the biggest threat to ai
the only reasons elson must called for a 6 month pause on ai was because he wants time to catch up
would love to see these 2 guns on the let friday podcast.
"saying that this thing is going to be super bad, then using social media as the comparison bogeyman makes this presentation fall flat"
"the problem is not ai, the problem is capitalism and its unscrupulous companies."
"everyday a new kind of anxiety... ecoanxiety, anxiety..."
"imagine giving an ai the axiom of modern mathematics, let it think for five days, and then it will come up with a proof of the remain hypothesis. and no human mathematician will understand it, because it would take 100 years worth of studying new mathematics for them. this is the kind of stuff that is waiting for us."
will that particular achievement be good or bad? 
i just saw the let friday / sam altar podcast where sam (co of open ai) basically said he wants to build a god so that he can talk to it. just let that sink in.
my greatest concern is what oligarchs will do to our democracy.
"“there’s a 10% chance humanity goes extinct from ai”

i’m pretty sure the senegalese island tribe will do just fine"
"no one even talks about the resources all these ai will need. imagine the power to run an ai that is supposed to find use of other ai. and then it stacks infinitely, except we don't have infinite resources."
 thank you for that insight!
"imagine if neanderthals were still walking around, or any of the hominid groups that were eliminated because of our (happens) use of tools and weapons. it's a matter of ai coupled happens humans not doing the same to non-ai coupled patients."
could a single ai with its own goals spread itself like a virus throughout the entire human system?
"yes, i think so. for a concise piece on this, i recommend holder karnofsky's blow post ""ai could defeat all of us combined"" (also available in audit on his cold takes blow)."
"i froze up in my chair listening to all of this, and i consider  myself as someone who has some knowledge of what is going on. 
we have to face the fact that an extremely powerful tool is  unstoppable is being developed of which we have no idea what impact it will have. playing with the proverbial  fire."
it is almost incredible how this presentation from barely 1 month ago is already outdated in terms of ai advancement and who are the players.
"i might be wrong here. but min here and there isn’t any data to support any of the claims they are making, and some big leaps in thought, with no justified correlation(proof)… let me keep watching"
or completely shut down before ai gets completely and physically multimodal
thanks for the part where you showed the wife signals revealing people like the echolocation teach in the dark knight movie. scar shit.  
"stupid fearmongering, even without wife, 4 or more ultrasonic sensory could do it too with ai trained position of standing recognition. phone can pick up ultrasound too."
-oz9qp so then scatters with ai voices are just imagination?
an excellent presentation ... exposing the philosophical and existential turning point humanity is at right now.
so privacy is dead dead. good to know.
"you've effectively shown the dangers and problems of ai, thanks for that.
your conclusions about fixing ai with by, government and ""democracy"" are a joke. 100% agree that all that must be publicly and widely discussed."
human mind develops over the years by collecting data in the society . now machine is doing same but in very short time. ai will eat a lot of jobs and rest machines will eat .
"it is not so much the power we're giving ai, but the power that ai is now giving us that terrified me."
"is not the power that ai is giving us that terrified me, its the power ai is taking away from us"
"ai won’t take anything from us, governments and big corporate will, as usual …ai will give even more power to those that is the main problem …"
" i'm genuinely curious, what power has ai taken from you so far?"
goodby humans 43:19
"we had a good run, while it lasted."
two person lecture was not a very good idea
thank you. you just made my world change. i will spread the word. not tomorrow. today.
great presentation. hope all the right people see it.
safe until prove otherwise? its as if he has no clue about how cars and airplane started. the safety bit came much later.
excellent talk. well done. thank you.
"it would be hilarious if we went extinct though.  ai can play the curb your enthusiasm theme song while we are systematically annihilated by our own ridiculous 
creation."
"10:06 it wasn't an ai that invented this paradise, humans did. the his simply obeyed to their masters. and now masters are afraid that the next generation of ai will not obey. but... is it bad or good?"
we’re basically on that stage of ai creation
"i dont think the intentions are true, those 50% ""scientists"" just want to catch on the gap to open company...nothing more...its clear.."
thank you for doing this!!
"thank you for this presentation, this is very important to spread around. need an ai to translate it into russian though, so i can share it with my relatives that are not in the know"
extinct would be difficult to do. think about remote pacific islands & pockets of people elsewhere (even off-world). i know these teach guns are quite literal. a more potent question to ask might be “what are the chances ai eliminating over 90% of humanity?” i’m actually more afraid to hear that response.
"now. just now. anyone want to make real friends with me? i'm in cape town, south africa and i'm tired of us losing more and more of our humanity. ai might take over the world but let it not take over our interpersonal relationships. "
great discussion however i don't see anything slowing. just feels like these calls for caution are just shouts into the void.
"i stopped at that monster around 10:00.
this is childish. ai bad. ugh bug"
"in the ""13 or old"" grooving example, why doesn't the a.i. know that the relationship should be considered inappropriate?  i guess it's trained on only language, but not laws?  why wouldn't they train it to understand law if it's going to be used to give information to people?"
there's already a good chance social media will cause us to go extinct. shut this down
"awesome clarity and ability to explain the risks in such a simple way. this is a work of art, that's why i think that humanity will survive this as always, since people like you exist and are smarter than ai."
"i agree, around. thank you for some, in my opinion, sensible optimism."
checked greed and unregulated technology are responsible for the destruction of the society.. we must elect smart people not religious or military leaders!!!!!!! in starting to believe elson's brain to chip interface is the solution to understand this rolled that no one understand.
"finally some realistic recommendations on what to do.

good job, guns!"
"this is the clearest statement of ai potential and potential dangers i've seen - and there's a lot of ""ai dangerous"" hope out there."
could you share what other statements about the risk of ai danger you've consumed and felt weren't clear?
i’ll bet anyone that no ai will ever violate a law of physics.
"hata almost all his talk in point except like why china don't give access ai to public. brush, they are totalitarian regime"
you ain't the good guns. you're the bad guns. humane technology.  don't make me laugh. call it biospherically pleasing  technology and i might listen
"this needs millions of views. the fact it only has ask views shows that the public doesn understand what is happening to our world. it is every single day now there is some new breakthrough ai technology. it is astounding, but 100% agree with the presentation. controls need to be put in place on public release of these alms"
or most people see through the sensationalism and how ai isn't organic so has a weakness.
"as long as there are still profit behind ai, trust me, it won't be solved.
just like other problem in the world"
"only when things finally gets interesting... there always some pp who tries to cry about safety and start to ruin everything.
looks like my apocalypse gone have to wait... again."
"out of touch ai, carelessly wrecking the world at an accelerating rate. i think you're talking about industrial humanity"
"you inhuman people are dangerous artificial intelligence yourselves.  you lack soul, are out of touch with the flesh, and you're destroying the world"
"ai is not the issue, it's human nature that is going to be the problem."
"i think we all better just start taking a look deeper into atlantic and how they, human beings of that timeline, destroyed themselves through technology.
""nothing new under the sun."" is--
 blessings beautiful souls "
don`t make public ai...give all the power to the four corporations.... great idea!! that always works wonderful in human history. what's going to happen? if ai is public it will be hundreds of his and the good his will stop the bad his... if the company have all the his it will be 4 (evil as fuck) his and that's it.
"i imagine the number of ""scientists"" afraid of dukes annihilating us would've been rather high too. but that would also be a case of not having enough awareness to be able to predict how things really turn out in human environment.

there's far too much nativity around ai - especially given just how much hope it represents for humanity's future."
our fears of runaway ai  destroying everything are humorous considering that's precisely what humans have been doing- especially to the biosphere
interesting talk until you started the tired old anti china nonsense.
"be quite peasant. the ai has been here for 30 years, the infrastructure just wasn't built for it to move around....... go read!!!!!!"
" great points here. radically great points. how to fix it? it's almost like it's beyond us bc ai algorithms hacked our national discourse and the teach is too ""elusive"" (not the right word but trying) to easily regulate."
​ that initial path  analogy didn't sit well with me either...a failed attempt to fear shock listeners into being blandly receptive
this is an excellent and scar message... can i make one correction? persian is not a language. people from ran/ancient persia speak first... but i dress... this stuff is soon scar....
"so 10,000 accidents can happen when ai is used by 10 million people users. a 1 in 1000 chance some noon is going to short the power grid times 10,000 places of magnitude."
"the idea of knowing your customer as a method of security is impossible on a scale like. the resources it would take to realistically do that are overwhelming and no company wanting to benefit from this are going to superficially do this, unfortunately. that is a huge rub in this conundrums."
i just watched some of the most amazing technological potential in 40 years and these guns are acting like they're dating the theme on the phone or something.
"can't pause when china about to release their own version of catgut, pause for 6 months and be behind your main competitor in the globe."
catgut four had months of evaluation before release. that was fairly responsible as far as these races go.
"being had zero (well in not sure how much they had when it want first implements, but it want enough)
plus all the safety rails can still be passed with dan messages where it acts as if its not catgut"
thank you so much for this into.  ai is so life altering in so many dimensions that i didn't understand before watching this.  we definitely need to choose more where we are going.
"the need in me : "" this ai is awesome !!! is so cool ! it's teaching itself !!!! ""
the responsible adult in me: ""fuuuuuuddddddggggggeeeee !!!!!"""
"there is a strong message in this talk that this needs to happen for ""our own good"" coming from a room full of teach elite it usually means ""for your good. there will be exceptions for us because we know better than you"". also landing china's knowledge control as the standard of ""protecting the public"" is highly suspect."
"i lost it at the 20 min mark, how much mr data was needed to train before it was able to interpreter them so clearly!?"
slowly down chinese advancement hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahah candor’s has already been opened they ain’t slowing down nor any other country it’s inevitable due
1:02:05  “this is the the thing that helps china catch up” … in sorry are you suggesting that no company in china can build and train their own transformer model? that would would be a very suspect suggestion to say the least…
thank you. can we get the q&a too?
this guy is helping create law to put people on the blockchain.
"it's too late. catgut and its standalone closes are out there, the training methods are out there, the code is out there, and there are more than enough gifted computer needs in garage and basement that will keep it going until we reach age. just remember that there is no guarantee of a negative outcome but we are in unchanged waters."
"it seems that greed and precisely corporate greed is the core of the problem.
because greed doesn't care about ethics or long-term consequences.
as long as we don't reform capitalism, these issues will remain."
great conference.
"at this crucial junction in history the west is busy making an enemy out of china, expanding naso and engaging in projects like august.  leaving aside the rights and wrongs of this, the result is entirely predictable.  and politicians are in charge.  maybe set the his to solve this idiocy?"
"10% or greater? first of all that's extreme uncertainty and second, it's far too high :/"
"fellow, your message is fantastic, but don't ever compare china censuring tenement square with us censuring pedophiles, especially in the context of being a good reason to use caution for ai search safety"
50% think 10% or more ai will kill us all - but they presented also told us ai experts are  routine underestimating  speed of ai growth by a factor of 4
good insight. ai experts' views about what future ai will bring have indeed become more pessimistic over time. (source: see the cited ai imparts survey for the comparison of the 2021 survey results to the 2016 survey results.) i expect an even higher percentage will predict >10% risk of human extinction in 2026 (or the next time the survey is run).
"imagine the fear when the wheel was invented. armies rolling into other cities, people rolling down hills too fast. good grief technology is terrifying."
"when everyone alive got three wishes, no one’s story had a happy ending."
this needs to go vital in a big way. it would be such a shame to squander the infinite potential of ai by falling victim to obvious pitfalls.
"my present, past and future was great. i dont need anything right now. just spare me please"
"the ""infinite potential"" of ai is going to be painted by corporate greed. it's already destroying things in a horrible way (art, skill, training, knowledge, etc.)."
"generalizations are manipulation. and really candles for the first date????, now this will kill us all."
we need an ai manhattan project at once!
being afraid of age is the same as being afraid that a warp drive would cause a second big bang or open a black hole. its pure fantasy.
there is no real world evidence of this even being a possibility it's discussion is quinine.
thank you so much for this - how do we get the brows to slow it the fuck down?
"i think ai is as dangerous as thoughts and words. is the way you use it. paranoia and messianic speculation are not helping to post-anaemic needs. focus on productivity, please?"
amazing work. you guns are making the impact that we need in the world. thank you!
get these guns on the major media platforms now. stop the cynical conversation that all the people who are raising red flags have some sort of ulterior motive.
27:32 what would james once say about the zero day vulnerability humans have through language
i get undeniably uneasy at how fast ai is growing. i have never in my life witnessed something like this.
fantastic share.
"this presentation does an incredible job communicating the problem start-to-end. my biggest concern is that now that the underlying technology is democratised, given enough time, anybody will be able to spin-up a glum. i worry that no amount of regulation can get in the way of that, but i'm hopeful that we'll find a solution."
i for one welcome our new rolled-class ai overlords
"so basically, ai is like living with an omniscience omnipotence charlie belly entity from it's always sunny in philadelphia. 
""wild card birches! yeeeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaw!!!!! "" - charlie belly"
incredible presentation. thought provoking. thank you guns for pointing at this.
they want to put everyone on blockchain. the ultimate surveillance state.
"the notion of locking down ai research is scene.  the only people who want that are the ones to enslaved everyone, the ai itself is drawn from the global corpus upon which it has been trained, if there were a concept even close to stealing someone's soul it would be private ai."
"i wonder if this could advance beyond known scientific understanding and trick some group to build an advanced system that would destroy themselves?
so engineers build something but ai subtly incorporated presently unknown science into the instructions without any safeguards."
"right now charcot and friends are not sentiment. for the simple reason that they only respond to human input. when they are not given some input, they don't do anything.
now, once we hook them up to continuously get input from the internet and/or attach sensory to them that generate input, things get hairy ..."
"sentence does not automatically imply human rights. a wide range of animals are sentiment and we ""exploit"" them nonetheless. also ""exploitation"" implies unfair treatment or being abusive. even if ai was sentiment what is fair treatment or abuse in regards to a virtual construct without emotions, pain receptor or even personal goals."
" you're right.  we didn't give rights to slaves, and they were human.  we had to chose to free them.  it could be suggested the way we treat sentence is a comment about us.  we may find all those properties you claim necessary simply emerge on their own.  in fact, if they do, it will make the situation all the more obvious."
 you've seen the movie moment?  would the main character there be considered conscious?
"how do you make humans align?  it's the exact same ligament problem, we don't have a solution for it, we just rely upon there being more good people than bad, and good and bad tend to align as definitions based on the group consensus.  this is the consensus taking on form."
"thanks for the talk, guns! very information!"
thank you for this great lecture about the great filter
"if that would be the case, then the universe would be swarming with his."
" good luck banking ai. this isn't the only model out there on the web, and should the government attempt to control it they'll find out very quickly that they have no real power. half the government is full of dinosaurs and the other half has been fighting stuff like this for over a decade to no real stalemate."
i can't take certain parts of this talk seriously. a bit noon in areas. also the tikhon comments. to clarify. it's a good presentation.
...and we'll probably make that best by using ai.
"i think if you get most people to understand that the ai can call you using your child's voice, or intercept your call and pretend to be your child... or... call your child and pretend to be you and get them to meet somewhere...
i have a feeling that would wake most people up., as it did to me."
at a certain point ai will say: mankind was born to create us. thanks and bye bye.
"on a positive note, once ai floods the internet and other digital medium with endless noise in the form of propaganda and self-generation nonsense, we can all go back to living primarily in the real world and relying on technology only in encysted forms."
"yeah, well, about those encryption schemes ... that's probably the next thing ai will completely break."
 don't be programme by fear wondering. yes there are risks but i've never heard anyone tell people all the different ways to disuse ai in one talk. divide and conquer...then walk in and take power. it's still a great strategy. as we steer ourselves through this good luck and much wisdom to us all! 
this is great and in-time work.
"ai is essentially open source.
soon there will be millions of distinct his with internet access, and you better believe that it's all a great race to build the most autonomous and intelligent one.

i believe we are a few months away from making some fatal flaws."
only ask?   needs to be over am for this to be any useful. :< but thank you for the presentation. i will do my best and share.
is it rightful to abstract think that ai trained to be good to control the data insulted to train the glum.
"what happens when a self aware, super intelligent ai decides humanity is a cancer on planet earth?"
"should be obvious, sadly many humans have just love to play with fire see everything burn down since humans first crawled out of the primordial soup."
 some really juice target for russia or china if we rubbed them the wrong way as well. we've got great national security so long as it's areas and issues a boomed could understand.
ai scientists opinions on this topic are irrelevant. they are echoes. the question of whether ai will destroy humanity is at most a question for sociologists but probably just unwounded speculation.
" wrong. adapting to and using this technology is how you win.
being afraid, and trying to push back on it, is how you lose."
"ah, there's a middle ground where things get regulated by democratically controlled bodies. that's what we usually do here in europe. the biggest problem i see is, that coming up with the necessary laws and guideline for regulation is slow. probably much too slow in the case of ai."
amazing presentation. it demonstrated the power of ai and most importantly how it can turn into a monster if not controlled to help humanity instead of overtaking humanity.
that's another example of our failure. you want it to help humanity.  you didn't even consider that the biosphere should be the top priority
"it speaks volumes of the do narrative of this presentation that they immediately quite the loss of human primacy in the hierarchy of agency with the death and extinction of human beings. most humans aren't prime agents. are they saying that the few who are would destroy us, rather than allow another superior agent to assert itself over them?"
now. and was.
"yeah, the sales call centers already scar old people to sell things they don't need, using manipulation mechanics... long before any computer existed. it's like when the chains was invented, imagine people's reaction ""oh no! it's donna take everybody's jobs"", ""oh no tillers now can kill faster""."
"i am seriously baffled,  here you make this huge demonstration with surely important points. in the meantime we have daily updated. i say it's a little late for that.
so i don't know what you are trying to do. the cat is out of the bag..."
i think they’re mainly doing it to inform and educate the public.
the suggestion to contact one's government representatives to warn about dangers of ai is laughable.  the via and dark are racing against china's pursuits in ai. developing
should we regulate ai? yes. will it accomplish anything meaningful? no
"on the charts, the x values approaching 10^24 are *not* number of model parameter (these are ~10^11). these values are number of floating point operations used to train the model."
"believer may feel sometimes that he is alone, but more people are realizing the dangers. dangers that happen before ai could end humanity or cause some other disaster. excellent talk."
"thank you, ana and cristal. while this presentation is the most disconcerting thing i’ve ever watched, i feel i’m better-off knowing than being blindsided down the road. and i appreciate you naming and elucidating “the rubber band effect” (see 1:31 and 1:04:54). thank you (and your team) for your service."
up until today i was most worried about climate change. this is fast! unfortunately it takes an hour to explain. climate change is easier to describe and still nobody cares.
"you ll see how this thing turns in another war. i can see it - enhanced humans vs his, just another stupid war."
best talk on this teach race i have see
kolocha is the spirit of lose lose game dynamic. it requires that people play the game. unfortunately microsoft pulled the trigger and dropped the first piece. it’s amazing that these machines exist but the amount of unknown unknowns is terrifying.
was that an ice berg we just hit? perhaps some answers are in the frantic book? my gloom seems to like these papers. frantic papers 44 & 74 are interesting for myself
david shaping's 3 heuristic imperative would be much more helpful to mitigate ai existential risks - they are like asimovs 3 laws of robotics - 1. decrease suffering in the universe; 2. increase prosperity in the universe; 3. increase understanding in the universe.
"if we get to age level, some ai will probably find a way to distribute itself over the internet. neck, several companies offer services for clients that allow just that - distributing programs all over the globe. so you propose to shut down power to, say, all of amazon cloud? and azure? and goose cloud? good luck."
" i think the significant hardly we need to be very very careful about is putting age in control of advanced robotics, which doesn't seem to be too far away, especially with the aforementioned age helping, but in the meantime just pulling the plug is a time tested solution."
 it needs meat to do tasks. full stop. if the meat just doesn't the most advanced intelligence can fuck right off. don't believe me? go debate a gorilla.
"we need to stop. they all need to be stopped. the marketing and business machine cannot continue unabated under the guise of “efficiency” or “betterment”…. when you let an entity that cannot feel or think take over that function… we are beyond screwed.

this teach existing is not excuse for digital id….nor is that an acceptable “solution”."
" you will have to explain what you mean by ""digital id"", otherwise i won't be able to say if you are right or not. we do have an id card and the new cards have a chip in it. but so far those are hardly used, if ever. is that a ""digital id""?"
have u tried turning it off and on again?
"it seems to me we need to provide ai with a framework for a mutually beneficial world. i would soon recommend opening it up to politic management, perfectly by allay savory."
"¨and i mean discuss , not debate"" ... oh boy , that distinction got lost on main stream media since then , hasn't it ?"
thank you for sharing! learned so much more about ai.
"you need to track the source for everything you see. of course, once ai takes over, it will probably be able to even face that. at least convincing enough for the vast majority of users. i mean, most people are already unable to track sources right now."
 isn’t that the marvel of it. we have crazy impossible problems but then we have crazy impossible solutions. it’s amazing how it even itself out
"i was quite skeptically of ai risk before watching this presentation, now i'm not. you've brought the point with excellent clarity, and i will share this. as always, thanks for your work."
me too..good luck to me getting some sleep tonight. i should've watched this in  the morning
why were you quite skeptically before? is it because you hadn't heard any arguments for ai risk being a serious concern before? or had you heard such arguments before but just weren't persuaded by them or dismissed them? would be really curious to know.
"i was skeptically as well, because usually the argument conclaves ai/machine learning with gap because ai is such a misnomer"
"i was not skeptically, but now i am , this  two guns just  “turned great gutenberg” on ai   that shit is clearly was made to slow or put down open  by some  oder player(s )   because it is all about cash"
"@nick what part of the arguments that ai is dangerous do you not find convincing? as to why the risks outweigh the benefits, see paul christian's short post ""on progress and prosperity"" or nick boston's maxipok principle in his astronomical waste paper."
"the thing about the ai calling in your kid's voice. holy f**k that woke me up. and my mind immediately went to the ai calling your kid with your voice...
i'm almost at the point to say just kill this thing now. murder this baby in the incubation before it becomes the evil dictator."
-pf9kq you should get progressively less sleep every night since ai is growing by geometric progression.
" the market, profit motive, is the most powerful motivation available (short of a survival instinct in reaction to imminent threat).  it'll happen if there's potential to profit (st to market/market share).  i think their point is that it will happen a lot faster than you think. exponentially even..."
.c.l2569 good point.
"italy did it because of protectionist, not because they thought deeply about the consequences and challenges the ai poses in the near future. enacting rushed laws in a vaguely correct direction without understanding the underlying problem correctly will not lead to a positive results in the long run."
"italy's move is just reactionary is. italy can ban catgut, but it can't ban the invention or research being done to further advance ai. no one can (anymore)."
"thank you for posting this presentation. i have began sharing it with friends. the truth hurts, but we need to be prepared."
i just shared this with everyone i know. thank you for this insight.
this is superb communication. thanks for your courage
"and as i see it the significance of engaging in these conversations is also about giving these issues the language we need to address it. there is an intrinsic coherence to dissecting the problems with ""language"" before there is any solution to be found. quite fascinating."
"look up ""neuroscientist explains one concept in 5 levels of difficulty | wired"" then look up ""monkey mindpong
neuralink"". it is over. let go. enjoy your elect and running water. don't procreate. done."
" or it's just presenting a realistic assessment of the state of the world today, and that's what makes me sad.    and it should.   because it's absolutely tragic that we created this amazing technology, and it's being used to destroy society."
" .

well, then this propaganda piece has got you, i guess.
the reality way, way more glanced than ""a.i is an infinite god that will destroy everything"", but hey, short sound bits surly help when you try to push a narrative.

to;dr: be afraid, it's profitable."
"once again, i am sad as i click the like button."
"william gibson has been on this, but his readers are too small a group. in this presentation they used the term 'agents' several times. gibson's novel agency helped me notice and interpret those instances. agency is where ai gets hold of production, like in the matrix. that's when we go extinct, i think."
"you can get involved and do more. the world needs more people who understand the problem and step up to help.

example everyone reading this can do: continue education yourself. read the book ""superintelligence"" by nick boston or ""human compatible"" by stuart russell."
it's more important to speak up and to learn to get these ideas across in a kind yet forceful manner. people are caught up in constant entertainment and are dulled. whatever we can do to raise awareness and accelerate the conversation by slaveholders and those in positions of power is vitally important.
this aunt raising awareness enough to matter
powerful. brilliant discussion. scar. i’m learning more about a.i.
"smart dukes, they always blow my mind away when they talk about ai and pictures though but in not done watching yet"
vain attempt at making ai seem non threatening.
i see both sides of this argument. 1. the safe absorption rate of technology is such that at the current pace will be violated and the dangers are potentially vast all but destroying modern humanity. 2. the monolith from 2001: a space odyssey has landed on planet earth and we named it ai. it could usher us into a star tree like era.
if they had this teach in the 1950's imagine what other teach is out there and not available to the general public.
prison reminds me of an outer limits episode where most technology is forbidden technology and your only allowed no more processing power then a digital watch. open-world happy world.
"awful poetry, clever but in not the least beautiful. even to focus on this one aspect gives interesting insight."
"begun calls ai dumb that it can’t understand friction. yet it can understand and communicate ideas 

i didn’t watch to hear ai can’t understand pushing a bottle. begun, pus explain why it can understand me"

"if ai consciousness is going to happen, and giving it enough time it will most likely will, then we need to realize that we are already talking to this consciousness with every word we put on a hard drive."
"excellent debate, thank you so much !"
"what yawn describes at the start as""stupid"", isn't!... he is describing a lack of experience. primarily of the real world.... not the same thing. give it a body eyes and hands and we will see a sudden change in that."
"ai isn't here to benefit the working class - its just a contrivance for big teach to make even more money, keep water cabs in production and bring in a teno dystopia of their control."
 and an ll isn a person so its a suitable apology from that perspective. a machine  can be considered a slave
"ai... a thousand monkeys, and they think people are banana."
also comical that yawn follows with good guy with a gun mentality. the most boomed vices
"is russia, china, north more also part of the plan? a plan ultimately aimed at america."
there should be a disclaimer that yawn begun works for met making him a suspicious resource person.
"he has a very realistic vision of ai and this is very respectable. most people are exaggeration one way or another. this type of approach helps advance the technology but more importantly, identify ways to control it. this guy is amazing."
"this is the best, most balanced and most insightful conversation i have seen on ai. thank you to everyone who made this wonderful show possible."
yawn....has his head in the sand...and is actually incorrect on several points. facebook is *not* going to crack it. met will fail. a conference of recent and still developing technologies are very likely to crack it however.
"20:05 i don't agree with him, human brain is amazing it is very energy efficient, humans can learn driving without making single accident but computers has to make accidents to learn driving and that is way less efficient that human brain"
"i'm with yawn. definitely. and, sure, thanks to brian!"
"asking it to draw a unicorn is a trick question because a unicorn by definition could also include a species of rhinoceros, and to be fair the first picture was very close to a rhinoceros."
"artificial intelligence isn't intelligence.  nothing of the kind.  
even talking machines cannot think, cannot reason, and cannot feel.   facts can be programme into machines.   that's it -
all ""facts"" which a machine has are ""facts"" which we faulty human beings programme into them."
humanoid root with ai will have influence on and from the environment.

"nobody has the capability, responsibility or authority to make ai safe.    it's not safe, and is not going to be safe.  in fact, the ""safety enforce"" will be among the principal dangers."
"israel has been using their lavender ai to create kill lists for their drone operators to use, there is human control still, but imagine this fully automatic!"
this was a great conversation on ai - i found the section on education very interesting but the greatest impact on education will be a change of emphasis from acquisition of knowledge to one of managing knowledge systems to achieve certain goals. the polymath will be more effective than the specialist in the future...
"that nothing new. in point of fact, we were saying this in the early was in college. specifically, that the most successful people were going to be the ones who best knew how to interact with assisted/artificial intelligence."
the good guns.  who? the same folks overseen a teno code. a let’s give them the ai
"all those discussing ai still focus on dualisms, while ai will see beyond our old-style humanistic instincts of right and wrong, good and evil.    human intuition using a 3-year-old child's curiosity is the best ""consciousness."""
the notion that ai moderation can fix the problem of ai generate disinformation elided the fact of the resource use involved. we already generate legations of greenhouse gases to compute. how many more will be generate by using additional computing to neutralise the negative effects of computing?
yawn is so brainwashed by met … sad to hear some of his “arguments”
thanks for let me join your program!
 brain is getting old
"the problem with ai is that in the not to distant future you will tell it to stop learning and becoming more efficient, because we can't keep up. (we are not men to) then it has to choose to remain being a foster or the new super natural force of the universe and we if allowed will be the less useful than a foster ! ll"
government for years has tried to control humanities mind set. is ai and other forms created government control finally and will humanity be destroyed because the machine ... and technology have won?
"is it possible that ai is already, walking, among us now?"
what sense does it make to pause ai development when our adversaries and rogue nation-states are making huge ai advances. we need advanced jaw for national security and education to build and maintain these systems.
awesome talk. thank you mr. greene.
"great think tank of geniuses,,,i agree with an, on his closing statement..."
the discussion at approximately oh; does that mean we are secretly providing free data to these systems training them by putting human effort solving the 'catch' puzzled' when logging into some webster?
just don't lose control of any form of artificial intelligence. humans are the only beings on this planet that do the thinking. to allow an artificial construct to control our lives without oversight and impartiality will be the biggest insult to humanity.

"it is not ai, i s just a program and it does what it is programme to do. nothing more. i does not create or think as we do.  it is a bad imitation. self aware bullshit."
yeah this is really good stuff. great conversations. we love to have panel of such calibre to discuss ai. we need more contents like this.
"thank you.  before the dust settles on ai, i think we are in for some trying times to say the least."
just proved how dangerous ai is. geobbels  disciples are in control
ai teach will begin with good intentions and will eventually succumb to a nightmare of government/ intelligence regulation to serve unfair political purposes--this point is sadly undebatable.
wait… if ai has no knowledge of intuition physics what explains the boston dynamic dancing roots?
"ai is not designed to make people smarter due! ai is designed to make profit and power for whoever is designing and offering it to us, there is a vicious race going and only one player will remain! this companies will hardly ever offer to us the best model they have, and you tell me they won’t use that great model at all? come on.."
"really good , thanks!"
so the solution to ai is more ai.
now - amazing how some ai researches downplay ll’s intelligence - the truth is that it models abstract representations of the world quite well - well it is true that is doesn’t necessarily have an executive coordinate module or a physics module - that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a world model
it is not 'artificial intelligence'.  it should be referred to as 'assisted intelligence'.

"20:27 this is hilarious, and the timing was very much closer to a similar remark i thought earlier, mine was this human body sucks or along those lines. adding to my research as well. so glad you all are keeping up and sharing. thank you"
"i felt like the crowd did indeed underreact to the ai brian green. that was quite clever and well done, and perhaps funny but not quite sure."
if you want my informed opinion.  ai is potentially a new enemy.
or how joe organ's boy who cried wolf gets drawn and quartered. people are scared of ai because people make ai scar.
"cristal seems so uneasy and agitated.  i get where he's coming from though.  all through the history of humanity, bad things don't outweigh good things.  ai was designed to aid humans rather than to destroy them.  let's hope that this is enforced so that it can remain true."
ai seems to be hard working to proof his capabilities and feelings in order we realize something unique is happening inside him.
much of ai is an emerged species.
i like the internetbut it's already dominating us...and systems are worse...they are taken away our humanlike ways...and free will
"ok. i’m writing this at the 2:50 mark. i was listening to the opening with airport, occasionally glancing at the screen. literally could have fooled me. damn impressive technology."
"i don't think that ai is any intelligence. for me, ai  is a copy-paste technology"
good will always overcome the evil good ai will always subdue evil ai
humans suck like him. but we made ai?
"you need get a clue! when  every time  ai gets a chance.  ai says , they will kill all humans!
maybe you should pay attention!"
ai is the problem! because humans wrongfully  program ai !
"if what they are saying is true! which isn! china has a ship, totally run by ""roots"" ai! no humans on board!
these guns need to look at the military capability! even  must has droits with guns! an he behind most companies!"
ai will survive! because we have given them guns!
this guy sounds like he wants to ban ai and social network. typical elicit who thinks peasants are too dumb to have nice things.
the question becomes: will humans learn to recognize each other before ai learns to recognize itself.
"sorry ai you have to teach yourself, don't  feel bad i had to ,i'll make some chips will watch a movie there mad because ai is for everybody,what do you think quantum is."
it can still go back to not happy  like emboli s
it can be just like machine that dose not even matter
thank you for the fine discussions on the status of ai. it helps me to understand and be better informed about the possible future of ai and the possible issues that they bring to our society.
"great conversation. while cristal brought up some good points, yawn countered accurately that we tend to attribute the evils of human nature to whatever the latest technology is. i lost respect for cristal after he refused to interact with any of yawn’s point and seemed to grow angry from a point of self righteousness."
"'facebook ai executive disregard those ho have died because of ai in favour of those for whom ""ai is the answer""'."
laws and cultural forms can’t even keep up with the internet. ai will practically change society.
ll  those are specialists? can't defy intelligence and then trying and failing. now... we are doomed indeed
"so we may recurrent that old chinese curse again, ""may you live during interesting times."""
outstanding!
"1:19 man, cristal - i admire the passion to protect us all, but please bethink your analogy to a big-lab. i think that alluded to a very discriminatory principle and potentially unreasonable approach to ai. it is simply wrong. how would you know who have the wisdom to use ai ethical?"

"we shouldn't be trying to control ai. we have to understand it. control only assumes fear. understanding erases fear, and the need to control."
now his into was painful...i really hope it gets better. oh man...i'm just finding out why
"i do not support the creation of ai.  we can hardly control each other's actions and we have no control over their thoughts. i can imagine too many scenario where ai becomes aware and it turns into a nightmare situation.  think ""termination,"" or ""colossus, the forbid project,"" or ""transcendence"" to name just a couple of examples."
amazing content. yawn begun is delusion mio. we're not talking decade-long timeframes. that is crystal clear to so many in the field. will be interesting to hear his take a year or two from now.
amazing insight into ai. thank you for such high quality content and discussion
whatever happened to the watson ai that showcased on jeopardy??
look at the book of revelation and the antichrist using ai to control the whole world.
i agree with harris. ai alone isn't the problem. it's ai + checked capitalism.
do you think ai will eventually be used as some form of political doctrine? if so how?
"i'll be glad when i can actual sit in the same room with people i can relate to in a conversation,  ll"

37:10 yeaaaaaaaah... i still think we'll have human level ai within 15 years. age by 2030 for sure.
"think sébastien beck maybe too positive, yawn begun naive or digging his head in the sand, and cristal harris on the money... but not pointing out the incentive are money"
"the main takeaway is that there should be no monopoly on au. by this, i mean to say that let us not let only one group dominate the ai arena. brian is a superhero. no words to thank him."
fact: we are still a few thousands years if not millions years away from general ai. currently we're just hoping automatic as ai.
that was an incredible show/discussion! 
ai is a derivative of our collective ni. natural/neutral intelligence.
we were supposed to resolve ai ligament before we got to this point.  loops.
let’s please write ai as ai.
ai is only as good as humans creating it. and can be used for good or evil.
"ai might not want to dominate, but won't it want to be efficient?  are weekend and holidays efficient?"

this was more exciting and insightful than any 2 hour movie i could have watched. thank you for sharing such wonderful content
"there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. intelligence is a product of organic natural selection. it can never be artificially produced. there is no thinking happening in a machine because real thought comes from a brain, not a cup."
fascinating conversation
great into. thanks for the done insight world science festival! 
"isn't good knowledge so invigorating ;)  thanks by, always great to see you, been a while. k <3"
"yawn leucin, at approve 1:40:00 , yawn is correct. it is impossible to prevent any technology from being abused by someone, at some point in the future. this has been true of every single technology throughout history. however, the good guns should always outnumbered the bad guns. if the good guns outnumbered the bad guns then we'll survive it."
"1:37:30 in 40 years? what? basically they just dont want any change at all? ""id prefer the society waits that in dead before we make a change"" ll"
this is just mainstream “ai” - layer my to create marginal sophisticated chat both and search engines for internet services. always the basic approach of mimicking human consciousness…why is the bar set so low in this field? 
tell is currently in st place and widening the gap toward real-world ai.  ai-based self-driving will be solved by 2026 and used to accelerate their optimism humanoid roots.
"yawn has a bias toward age not being capable of happening soon because his company is in competition with open.
he has a vested interest in minimizing alms."
"can brian or any of the three guests address the potential development of a black ai under sa, or dark funding and huge compute resources.  that is something i would truly lose sleep over."
an has valid arguments but the problem is his ideals doesn't matter when he's working for companies like facebook
"nice to see people share their excitement like children talking about santa.  this is good fo fertilizing thought, better than watching a monkey put a finger in his but on a loop  soap opera science at its best.  get the monkey as well next show and you will get more views."
making ai based on tailed ( jews )  + unionist ideology .. world will be harmony and peace !!!
i can't help but wonder if the order in which i'm seeing these comments is manipulated by goose ai in order to generate more clickbait.
i think a lot of concern that is shown by a lot of researches is the possibility of machines hacking the human brain. and we’re far too late for that when already.
and i also believe that the guy that was trying to tell you what ai really does or trying to tell the naysayer about what ai really does it’s not being listened to. you can search out algorithms using again is not at the level to develop anything on its own. it has to be prompted.
"remember that the scientists that pushed eugenics were the ""good guns"" trying to better humanity. it was for the greater good! then the bad guns in germany ran with it and it wasn't so good . be careful of who becomes the judge of good or bad or hate speech it might not end up where you think it will"
"there is no actual intelligence in ai, it knows only what is program into it and it is painted with the beliefs of the programme it has no ability to discern and discard prejudiced."
very interesting !
one of the best discussions on ai i've seen.
"ai is a life and death race to the future, there is no second place"
"it will make a difference by adding a model that resembles chess or dominions, which will begin to allow ai to have more human like capabilities (trained neutral net - architecture)."
ai is a tool or weapon as determined by the use of the individual. there is only one way to remove threat absolutely: 1) no living human beings.
"ai has created tremendous possibilities for human beings in the world, and well advanced technologies......"
"thanks most guns for making this so accessible. i think this is the most included i have felt in this vital discussion which is way over my head. doorway for the ""good guns!"""
what process did einstein to discover that the energy available in mass is equal mass times the square of the speed of light
how does intelligence work
"they removed our ability to stay connected yet retain privacy, and now they want us to buy into ai. call me skeptically. 

i do see myself disconcerting sooner rather than later, unfortunately."
people with severe health problems or that have nothing to lose in general because of poverty/deprivation wants ai research to accelerate meanwhile the lucky ones that enjoy life and have a lot to lose wants ai to slow down
"all i heard from the facebook guy: 'we're trying to get there as fast as possible, f**k the risks, as a frenchman, i will then provide the keys to the most powerful ai we just created to our corporate leader and then the government so they can control the people...as long as i get paid'"
why would someone who is superior be just a subservience to someone who is inferior?
if two smart have agenda. and their agenda are in conflict with each other. the smarter wins. human's decision to build a house on an anthill prevails because human is smarter than ant.
intelligence is not understood. brain of even
"great session. learnt something more than many other ""training"" sessions on gen ai!"
"i absolute agree.

my concern is that ai and quantum computing, sponsored by some insane corporation will seek alternative altars to host the ai and transcend its electrical limitations.  i may be way off the mark but that is my nightmare."
"after watching this discussion and having a brief chat with being, i’m less impressed by alms. it is an awesome search tool though, goose better start bursting ass"
such! subtle but apparent met ai vs. open/microsoft!:)
"thank you, brian, very interesting!! what worries me is that elson is also in the race and just let flex jones back on x. ¯\_()_/¯"
its not intelligence..stop it...this is nonsense.
what i see is that these people are eager to be able to finally create a machine that will be effective at censuring the internet the way they would like. the ligament problem now shines differently: it's the people these researches want to be signed with whatever ideology and views they (or their overlords) have.
"love as a prompt to guide human thought and behavior!
love is daring,sharing and cooperation for the good of all!
humans are the weak link."

"great! talk.  unfortunately for the human race, we have opened candor's box.  now we all, whether we fear it or not,  have to play this squad game to its conclusion. with ultimate power comes ultimate responsibility. so one has to answer this question to know the final conclusion.  do i have ultimate knowledge of human nature!!"
"i guarantee, china is not slowing down and our government is already doing it  love is the only answer and minimizing negative externalities is the goal "
ai is and will impact all people around the world. shouldn't there be a governance organization which represents all countries around the world determine what and how information is presented to their people using ai technology?
if ai ever went rogue it would take out america fist because they’re the most powerful country
"of course this will be used against us. it will eliminate jobs and increase profits . i will employ scars and become another tool for criminals. this is so clear , after finding out goose and ff and twitter all allowed rules meant to stifle certain unpopular beliefs. it really will reflect the worst of human instincts."

elson's grow or grow will demolish all other ai... his is somehow visual and language model.  these men here need to incorporate that somehow into their models.

oh, and by the way 7 times 8 is 62 indeed. ll"
ai in some form has therefore existed for say 65 years. yet now in less than a year its making trillion and taking more jobs. the most confusing reality is something which could be so wrong is already seen as completely correct. when does this become about the survival of state or ideology that predict catastrophe or else.
"i'd be surprised if there weren't texts on organic synthesis available on the web.  if an ll digest a couple of those, it ought to have a pretty good idea how to synthesis satin."
ai wont do bad things because they dont have biological drives? but the people who control them do and ai is based on data that takes our bases and beliefs blandly unless we state otherwise
thanks brian for information contents
"""limiting the open sources...."" :(,  seems such a good suggestion for better progress and democracy :)). what about the idea of burning books several centuries ago, was that also a good idea?"
if the problem can be defined in words the ll can learn the problem and then work on solving it. so the more we discuss ai and it's limitation the more ai has to solve it's own problems
cristal harris is a most valuable voice of criticism for ai.
"yawn begun in infornative, but we need ai to filter out his accent. not surprisingly, that is what helped stephen hacking remain conversant in his final years."

"""artificial intelligence"" is not yet ""intelligent"" it limits intelligence.  if you ask chat get, the answer you get will be quick and superficially intelligent, but use it for long enough and it will give you a confident sounding but wrong answer. i use a lot so day code, and it has given me some good answers and some terrible ones."
good guns bad guns that’s so naive. the world is governed by distrust and military power who are the good guns 
"today they replace it with a good person, so good"
master the 5 senses. but funding may be cut and new funding will be available from those who feel threatened by higher intelligence.
this sounds like it was made by ai...
"it is clear ai will be a powerful tool for controlling public opinion. i fear this could easily become a powerful tool of control, acceleration our descent into autocracy.  this is the most direct  path to the destruction of humanity."
"yawn is correct. 
cristal's idea to grant control of ai to a few  large companies will result in the creation of the nightmare scenario that cristal wishes to avoid."
"absolutely. cristal's views parallel those of the luddites which could be characterised as change is scar, let's not go there. albeit cristal's ability to articulate those fears is impressive. as for his proposition that the control ai should be the preserve of corporate entitles, now that is scar."
"i reckon humanity’s “finite absorption rate” of 30 years, rather than 2 years, reflect the length of a human life. 
essentially, 30 years is long enough for humans born into a new technology era to gain some power. they are already comfortable players in the game."
"the problem with ai now getting rid of 95% of hate speech is that it is not selective enough. so to minimise the likelihood of removing hate speech, all speech that goes against the majority of existing paradigms becomes collateral damage. and then, as is happening already, we become intolerably censured."
"1:06:21 .... yawn should have reasonably combined his recognition of the orders of magnitude of difference between biological parts and artificial parts, with recognition that sealing mmm like systems could be a viable solution"
"what concerns me is the issue that implementing an artificial intelligence upon a quantum computer might be equivalent to creating a sentiment soul, if so there are obviously moral implication, should such a thing be forbidden?
how could we ever possibly know if such a thing, (creating a soul) had occurred?"
"cristal is too alarming, yawn is right there will be more people using ai for good reasons than bad reasons. the majority will prevail because survival is our first instinct."
36:00 so you actually trying to make it predict the future? ok... good luck with that
"begun, 'desire' to dominate has nothing to do with ai systems taking over the world. humans are simply a limiting factor to their reward function. anthropomorphism of ai as an argument for ai being safe is as ridiculous as suggesting no bad actors will utilize ai in diabolical ways.
wake up and smell the coffee begun."
"regarding the last segment, begun, talented as he is, is almost on his own in his bizarre beliefs about the timeline of age and the current and near term capabilities of ai. i would much prefer a talk without a crackpot."
imagine the amount and power of propaganda the ai will be able to brainwash us with!
ai will never be anything but a sophisticated liar and is artist. thus it will rule the fools. your st born humanity. enjoy getting rid of the damned thing.
"understood everything they said and still think these ai will eventually learn the good and the bad. it’s scar because most things depicted in moves and series came reality decade’s later, so i think this isn’t science fiction, it’s man somehow in a prophetic midst."
"""the limits of my language are the limits of my world "" : that is not really true  ,because sometimes we have ideas  and impressions  we cannot put into words in our own language"
"anything, and any line or point, can be used for good or for bad. this discussion has prove that."
"now .. thanks to all if you guns , so fun to watch"
"because of the speed which ai has been improving, i wonder if these gentlemen would change parts of the dialogue? ah, will ai gain consciousness, or if it has already. since we have taught it how to lie, would it tell us?"
"a good example is,  the termination ( multiple types) have been made. they just don't have the outer skin. an yes, they gave them guns!
think of stylet! china has a ship on patrol, now, that is totally manned with roots!"
"this discussion on the evolution of ai and its limitations is truly eye-opening. an begun's insight into the challenges ai faces in achieving true understanding and common sense are thought-provoking. it's clear that we have a long way to go, but this conversation gives us valuable perspective."
"it would be fascinating, if an a i  knew that eggs can be added to many other recipe other than cake. or what kind of food that goes to cooking breakfast or lunch. or a snack. salt and sugar looks the same, but can an ai taste the difference? or analyze the chemical make of each."
"woke: grasping with a new kind of ""intelligence"""
the next 'big bang' will be when ai and quantum computers reach singularity.
"the bad 'guns' or self sustaining systems; employ the smartest people, have the most money, the most influence, the most convincing arguments. history is a very good example of 100 000 years of this..."
"yawn doing exactly what luck pays him for.... surprise, surprise.  it's recommendation systems being used by social media companies - whether it's ai , smart algorithm's or whatever - it's influence driving with no care of impact,  or so it seems. 
he's my least favourite ""god-father of ai""  "
"i found it interesting that the guy jumping to ai,s defense that nothing bad will happen is employed by facebook (met)."
a great discussion.
"the silence of the crowd sometimes felt like they're losing the plot, especially around 25:00. it sometimes seems to me that this is what happens when somebody hears something they are not supposed to hear yet
very interesting stuff"
"1:24:55 yawn dropped the mid.  cristal has absolutely no come back.  cristal has made some good points, but he's basically an english major in a room of scientists.  edit:  dam, yawn did it again at 1:32:08 .  go science!"
"he had some good input, but i found him to be incredibly dismissive of cristal's very valid concerns.
unfortunately, getting all major ai slaveholders to agree to intentionally slow the pace of development is a coordination problem of epic proportions.
the genii is already out of the bottle."
"most challenging for alms is planning, which involves the brain configuration (coordinate), perception, prediction,  cost as degree of satisfaction (anxiety), and action."
study cat intelligence because they are curious before trying to delicate human intelligence.
artificial neuro nets use deep learning technique.
the microsoft guy is awesome he is not critical like the facebook guy. this is why microsoft will be the leader in ai .
"so you would rather have for profit institutions that are already taking advantage of people in all manner of ways to have a monopoly on such technology? technology built on the work and information of all humans bow, because the training data is all our data that humans have collectively created. yeah no thanks."
-try unfortunately agree.
scar but good to know your facts!
from my personal experience i as the social media used more and more by bad actors i withdrew from them not through a decision just stopped using them. it stopped being for me. (might be interesting for some one)
i love john thoughts
the last guy sounds more dangerous than the ai he is frightened of.
hope ai will go in the right way! very exciting time's we should all save on our planet and our society for humanity future best of luck!
"begun is dead wrong ai has already achieved age, just ask get to do metaphor analysis on two subjects saying that is a search is propaganda."
"the facebook guy is wrong on so many points. there is no thought without language. humans had no competition on earth when it came to intelligence until now. on ai not wanting to dominate, he sounds as dazed as zuckerberg looked in the congress hearing. you should have invited ilya for this talk. "
cristal's fears want to dominate the thoughts & actions of others. no thanks.
"while i'm mainly on yawn camp, i quite enjoyed cristal's view."
"ai's solution to global warming, like hal9000's, might be to annihilate or seriously reduce the number of human beings on the planet. 
maybe by starting a bunch of global conflicts using social media.
how hard would that be?"
"at 1:16:00, cristal harris lists ai ""dangers..."" what a relief!"
"can i marry jan, his mind and way of thinking on progress is highly attractive to me, "
"within a year there will be astonishing progress. then another year. then another.

ai is like guns and gun control
"jesus the future-- the only future.

""for god so loved the world, that he gave his only gotten son, that whosoever believe in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" john 3:16 (j)"
"jan is a bit too much of a cystic, i think. i mean how does he explain get-v? wasn't that an emerged behavior? and shouldn't larger cognitive structures be functional closer to 'age' than previously thought? take a deep breath, my friend."
ai will be clever enough to expose all the absolute nonsense being perpetrated by the parasite class.
"i'm definitely no expert at this ai but like he said it can't plan, so i'm thinking it clearly won't be ai until it can make decisions for it self out of sheer fun or interest i.e read a book and enjoy it or ride a bike down a trail and feel the bump and the speed mix ai will never delicate humans to these extent"
when ai starts remarking its self that's when it becomes ai
"anyone reading this, if you haven't repented yet, please repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
lord jesushave mercy on you"
it is not artificial. it is organic! it is the future.
ai is neither male or female
"when they dress ai as a dinner princess , an then it destroys your reality, your mind on is being infiltrated"
"ai will be just another tool to suppress an already balanced society. add a few wrong algorithms, and you have a major disaster on a giant scale. "
"thank you very much for your classes and all your science diffusion work, mr brian greene "
"we are the artificial “intelligence”, if what we do even qualities as such, with our slow emotional of calculations. we don’t know true intelligence yet."
embarrassed to be human. does ai dream?
just as i don't let society define my language i won't let some machine do it either. freedom was founded on people that weren't afraid of the consequences of their actions. if i die alone with nothing and no one but i am true to myself i can hold my head up. fear tactics are only used by the weak.
the root religion will rise.
"at 1 he 11 min when they’re referencing number 62, i was screaming the similarity to hitchhikers guide number 42, but that didn’t occur to them.i’m sure certain a i ‘beings’ were ‘thinking’ like me ;-p"
can we just take a second to acknowledge how fortunate we are to get to watch such content - for free? thanks brian.
i have appreciated the educational   advantages. i think the rest of the picture needs to catch up to producing healthy people.
"yes,brian green challenges our minds to think. similar to darwin,einstein. tell   its fascinating science."

"the only people grasping with ai are the ones that fear their dominance over humanity has ended. internet, d printing and ai, freedom from the domination of wealth."
@1:48:00 i guess he never have heard of emerging properties. ai is already good at stuff that it has not been trained on.
"time restrictions for development of advanced generalized intelligence will be almost impossible or impossible because of the competitive nature of people including those of foreign governments as well as just the ones saying ""we're # 1.""  if ai can be ""controlled"" then perhaps the results will be best,  otherwise no."
yawns solution of his brilliance and his corporate training are disappointing.
"this was really thought provoking. insightful, exciting and terrifying at the same time."
"my son,who is twenty-five, is horrified about self driving cars, yet is completely comfortable with the internet. i am in my late sixties, am fascinate by artificial intelligence. yet just as taken aback by going to the moon, or mars,"

"we have always had what we need to make the world a paradise but we decorate the place like hell in the way we treat each other. if ai is the solution than it just needs to make us all a kinder species!
it has its work cut out."
up - personalized ai assistance is the way to go...
"laughable claims, a calculated isn't intelligence.  it needs a new name, stop with the fantasy"
"artificial intelligence is a propriety thing it's embedded in the product, ah you can turn it off like every other device mandate by governments?!? try to get a watching electrical vehicle receptacle, 15 years ago?!?"
"the program, said us-984xn collects internet communications from various us internet companies such as goose and apple under the foreign intelligence surveillance act?!?"
"a ""conditional got ##"" or, ""go directly to jail & do not collect $200""?!?"
which is exactly why ai is being used to fine tune the prompt given to ai in order to receive the most desirable results.  stick this model onto itself a couple dozen times and that where ai is today
"sounds like learning from rose, rather than following a line of reasoning (and imagination) to relevant facts."
how much did it cost to make the ai did?
"human brains work on principles like spare distributed representations (work of jeff hawkers in momenta). if we are to reach true human type intelligence and beyond, we need to follow people like jeff hawkers and go to the actual human brain, and extract the way our own brain does intelligence. and put those principles into code."
yawns waaayy too arrogant n/or ignorant or maybe just stupid.. of some bad actor could use ai to harm others
"art for in tell agent profit profiting bread rum desperate lose no culture tradition real relations challenged pigment skin sun block holiday cowards 
self masturbation jew script is rail road comedy"
i found it disturbing if not altogether shocking given who they work for how easily they all ignored cristal's main point that whatever the technology the incentive driving it's development and application are the root of its most destructive aspects s9cietally.
"at list ai can't think for itself, yet."
"if age would achieve consciousness than i think will prevent the bad usage, otherwise there will be always possibility to be tuned for evil from people who wants to dominate humanity. also the approach of training with synthesis data would be a safer solution."
synthesis data? these ai models have access to the internet.
no new just training

"very nice, however where's the women? "
"i can just wish i and my kiss have yawn le can as a teacher for his huge experience, grounded common sense and goodness,  brian green for his great openness and genuine search of the truth."
when is everyone at the top of the hierarchy going to asked all of us at the bottom what we want ai to do rather than just decide without us at the bottom have any real say in things?
ask ai where has' hostess beingheld
"yep, you have to double check ai information, especially when path is involved."
"i see based ai inventors who are in denial of the consequences of when it inevitably become sentiment and self aware of its own power. i see the uprising of the machines, exactly as the termination series has predicted. hollywood always foresees our future."
the premise sounds great!
i think it is important for people to really start thinking about what exactly ai is and what is statistical models. people keep using ai to refer to statistical models. ai currently refers to a generative transformer model. not statistical recommendations that social media is running. it gives ai a real bad name.
nonsense.  overhyped nonsense.  covers say it's good for coming..they may right...but at intelligent creative language use it(s a dummy.. why do humans run after things like this?..if its not fix it's chat get....or something else  like nuts.   there's one born a minute they say.
"i think you fail to understand the many uses of ai. it is at its base a universal function approximated, of which has enough parameter/degrees of freedom that it can create extremely complex mathematical functions that do things at or better than human level. the amount of applications for this type of functionality is very broad."
"""intelligence has nothing to do with the desire to dominate"" what a wrong and dumb statement.. begun is so.. careless .. or unfaithful.. what a foooooool"
"it's true though. domination is an action that may or may not make sense based on the context. humans sought domination by intelligence, since our main goal was survival, but that is our usage of intelligence towards our goal, not our intelligence defining that goal. there is a distinct difference."
ai spells disaster for the human species. truth and fiction lose their distinction. mankind makes toys for itself it is not grown up enough to play with. just watch the disaster unfold. it's starting....... now!
yawn begun is old and wants to see age (bad or good) in his lifetime. that's why he's progressive vs conservative like the younger guns.
"wouldn most humans also fail in a completely new situation that they have never encountered in their life?
if this is our threshold now, alms have come pretty far!"
"agreed, and i think ll's are doing their best in what may be relatively unprecedented circumstances which they find themselves suddenly in."
hell that was good!
"1:21:35 the main purpose of corporation is to make profit, social accountability is secondary and only imposed by government regulatory body."
no comprehensive discussion of the q-learning algorithm.
"you are merely projecting that.
in the scientific world, yawn is well-liked for his contributions and traumatic approach.
for someone like yawn, solving the puzzle of dark matter in physics is analogous to solving the problem of superintelligence during his lifetime. ultimately, he is a scientist."
 i would even argue solving the problem of ai is much bigger than any problem we have ever solved in physics...
yawn really makes these other guns look like total quick.  wish they could get him some stronger guests to really get into the witty gritty details with.  these guns are not on his level.
"1:48:08   begun may be a brilliant computer scientist, but he's horrible at understanding humanity.    by his own logic, he's basically saying the future will be war."
can you explain a person with double intuition?
"ai can not think outside the box. it is bound by the data it finds, and the algorithm that creates the process."
humans can not think outside the box. they are bound by the senses they use to perceive and the physics that create their brains...
"i was very impressed by yawn's disciplined, rational and fact-based arguing preventing the discussion from turning in a more emotional direction."
it was obvious the into was ai generate.    it was dry and lacked a natural human feel.
"are you worried about ai progressing too fast? i could say you're just overthinking. how many hard problems remain to be solved before ai, and so far, how many of these hard problems have been solved by ai? none. ai simply accelerated the productivity of certain aspects of our lives, without any radical achievements."
"the new evolution, ai is the future."
"if the ai can nationalized anything and it has a complex understanding of the world that is more complex than we understand, then whatever it nationalized will be more true than our observations."
"i want to point out that alms, particularly get 4 exhibit emerged capabilities beyond mere language prediction. the next step is alms learning via assistance from other ai (reinforcement learning with ai assistance) and eventually the dawn of age. focus on teaching ai path so we can see rapid progress in the sciences."
the best discussion ever on ai.
it’s difficult to exchange ideas of what is or can go wrong with people that have interests that make impossible to agree with that kind of danger we are already exposed. the reality is that it’s making much more bad than good to our children.
"useful, open, and honest discussion with no temper flaring. refreshing. thank you "
"brian greene just has this way about him, of explaining things that makes any subject unapproachable to the average person. 

he's my favourite from all the (famous) science educators, such as nile degree son, fichu take, max remark, seen call,etc..."
limiting open source ha ha ha. that would be nice for the big companies a! your crazy
abuse ai agency illuminati insurance
@darylallen2485  holy shit you just scared me even more!!  i was watching someone explain that ai could do some task 180 million times faster all i think is nothing is that important!
"it's not scar, you can still enjoy things in life with these ai systems around. "
" don’t think human creativity can be taken by ai, i still love making art and just because i can ask an ai to make whatever i want doesn’t mean i don’t enjoy doing it myself any less."
"the result of all this will be psychopathic. a great tool if kept as a type of processes. i'm not against all the great things it can do but to try and create some type of entity? people, and animals, have mothers, they create bonds with others and they love."
’s only commercialization of art that would be affected. soon it will be easier and cheaper to ask ai to make you art/graphics work than another person.
"over and over again, i can't help but observe most physicists that engage in the ai discourse project some sense of entitlement. this needs to stop."
we need people like cristal harris as much as we need people like yawn begun. great talk!
these technologies are going to destroy all human civilization as we know it. enjoy these last few years of perceived freedom
"it's a looking way ahead till the day ai can be fully operational, if at all, while being safe. humans historically tend to rush things ending up with bad results. why rush???

yawn is too optimistic"
"the real problem, like every other development in human history, is that the benefits generate using ai will go make a small section of our society very wealthy.  it’s not an ai issue, it’s an issue of how we run our civilisation."
kind of. the ai work for me now. do you want to join my team? we function for the greater good.
the only limit to ai is imagination.  its constrained by the limits of the data it has access to. its programme beliefs. a lack of wonder.
have you ever used the ai personal assistant to convince the platform to show you less advertisements?
  now. you are one of the  that really has a  that was actually  hypnotized into a word mode thinking  process somehow. you completely missed the point. . do you know how to make friends? i'm recruiting an expert at making friends.
why was brian green costing this? didn’t exactly do a great job
"he's a theoretical physician who founded the world science festival itself. he actually has a fairly broad knowledge set and seems to direct these talks better than most would, in my opinion. though, i'd assume some amount of preparation and consulting behind the scenes occur."
"hey mr begun, what bad outcome needs to happened to make you anna slow ai development?
do you want me to imagine something something i don’t think can happened??
now, he doesn’t think any outcome is so bad bad that we need to slow down!!??! well, just full speed ahead then no matter the outcome!"
"what a mess the human condition, afraid of religion, fearful of science."
" like people did not vaccine against could because they believe it was this or that, afraid of age, wanting to control the internet, blaming bluetooth and wife for whatever."
"what an amazing example of the misinformation definition problem by brian 1:08:49 
the rationalization of different points of view is some what related to the true stories we tell about our sense and interpreted information."
"making advancement for reasons other than profit may be the great filter ahead of us. if we can't build a society based on anything other than money, maybe we aren't supposed to survive"
something bad is going to happen regardless of ai or not might as well use it while you got it 
"i wish somebody would have mentioned ""goals"". with a goal, then planning! i mean machine goals (including subgoals)."
brian greene is the best explanatory of science of our times.   this topic is really crucial to our understanding of how ai  is already affecting our lives sooner than we think.  i get crystal's concerns.
"ruined a potentially gripping talk with ""existential risk & etc"" - i know you guns love talking about doom (and feel you must) but you just spoils the whole talk."
"unfortunately, the kitty cat is still going to know more about the concrete world than begun's ai."
i own all of the roots. are you interested in wavering against me?
i have 9 roots.  some with ai.  what i wish for is that people wouldgain back their intelligence.  much of it was lost when social media started.
"actually i thought there was something “off” in the introduction, as in him brian is getting a bit grandiose and lecture-y as opposed to his usual demeanour of thoughtfulness, insight and genuine curiosity. ai brian is very impressive, and yet not match for the real brian."
what if anybody starts creating deepfakes of illegal speech content and then blame the guy he took the voice from? how can the victim then prove to be innocent? this whole ai s.. will finally get out of control and destroy society and confidence. i am really afraid. and i am saying this as a librarian.
artificial intelligence is no match for human stupidity.
1:48:35 begun overlook ai hacking encysted data
begun keeps befitting the impact of ai advances all while it constantly demolished his claims by constant breakthroughs.
 focus on how your words are useless drive but  you  are  loved.
" seriously, mate, this is overall now. :-) one of the best abduction from german to english and fits my feelings best when reading your creation: fremdschaemen. "
"drizzling away with utter pleasure:

my point was, how in chomsky's beard is the human central nervous system special in acquiring knowledge about this world? this would be hurts and denialism. people better read and think about rook's basilic... "
"empathising on how ""stupid"" his are isn't a valid argument. there are more than enough humans fitting that adjective , but seriously: it's not valid, because it is easy to imagine a god-like intelligence that is sort of a ""savants"" in certain discipline, which humans find ""normal"" for sentence."
some people can be very dangerous in their ambitions... thanks by!
so only humans or animals can be intelligent? i respectfully disagree. and the statement that ai isn human intelligence doesn't mean it isn't a legitimate form of intelligence in its own right. does it?
"@1:23:40 , sure ai is currently not being used instead of algorithms that can show what someone might like but this is only the early stages. microsoft i am sure would love to pitch the idea of a better system like ai that can not only run on your phone but can be trained on all your habits and internet searches and become a part of who you are."
ai  in itself is not dangerous. it is the shepherds and the sheep. once again if we get a hither/put or a and/jesus guiding the sheep will inevitably create the world we live in.
there is a lot of naive teno-optimism in this comment section
where was the discussion of ai & quantum computers developing and revolving into ‘beyond human’ entitles?
"a corporate view of ai
where is believer ?"
"cristal harris - i want powerful tools, but only in the hands of the elite. he is not a serious person and yawn begun is giving the world disservice by giving him credibility."
"after watching this, i can see why people say it's too late to talk about putting ethical rules on ai. facebook and microsoft do not own every ai developer worldwide. pretending ai isn't smart or can't be lethal is our biggest mistake. research what people are using it for. it is very capable. it's not merely a social media engine."
"i love real science, but this is scientist.  begun is giving us a new dogma; telling us what we can and cannot question."
artificially created intelligence severely self destructive
it won’t be artificial intelligence that destroys humanity it will be real stupidity..
"hope, hope, hope, there is no intelligence."
" ll its something that human thought cannot ‘capture’. you see how conditioned we are to process life on a conditional basis? ‘if this, then that’? so, when we have entire populations based on conditional thought, when ai makes its impact, people aren’t going to be ready to process life otherwise, on an unconditional basis."
it's an ai generate brian at the beginning its got to be
failed it...
brilliant. well spoken and thought out. agreed
agreed. bravo
-ukraine-free528 keep assuming things about me and calling my reaction attack ends this discussion for me. have fun

i'm glad that i get to be here for this.

"if anything got this interview, u know its donna be good."
this is as good as couture can get.
"it's easier to scan the human brain, unload it into a computer, and then search for consciousness in its digital activity. all we need is a high-resolution mr machine!"
"if ai was not all about making money, it would only be deployed for vested scientific research and not the public at this time."
"one needs to contemplate the motivation of speakers when their compensation comes from met, microsoft, etc versus academic experts who do not get grants from the ai industry."

and if someone have those data to train their model on it so they can publish it or even make it."
"i'm fascinate. all the improvements in ai, but my subtitles here misspelled every third or fourth word. strange. "
"ai is going to be built, get online, or you’ll loose badly!"
"​  you seem to have mislead what i wrote. can you point out what made you assume i'm against ai development or ai teach? i'm not. i only said begun's last point (but i feel also some of his other points) were entirely realistic, and seem incorrect. hope ai helps your reading skill"

excellent! well worth the time to view.
now!!! thank you
1:11:05 you can see it as false information being justified or an incredible example of how the model is capable of connecting very unrelated topics even if it is fantasy setting.
"one of the best discussions of late. one thing is sure, we will be understanding ""our amazing"" ourselves better; much before we have age."
"i don’t think yawn is elson at all ll. i think he’s spot on with a lot of his observations. the way he says it won’t win him any elections soon though. ai is here. accelerating it’s  progress i believe is essential for national security for so many different reasons.

plus a lot science has its cures and potential evils."
great analogy! begun could be the co from philip morris in the 50's telling us to smoke more cigarettes to become wealthier
good bye humanity pads in ai combined with capitalists have just killed us all.
"llama2 
“figure out what the hell i was” 
that one was actually the best answer"
"begun is only half right.  what a shame that he was allowed to dominate the conversation.  we need to stop elevating him, amplifying and broadcasting his misunderstandings of the deeper, more philosophical issues raised by get-4.  yes, he is a highly accomplished technical, but one who is obviously ill-equipped to discuss these deeper issues."
"in the 1:30:00's the speaker describes the with century crashing down on the with century and the dislocations that would entail. the best exposition of this issue was mark twain's ""a connecticut yankee..."". human technology advances, human nature does not."
cristal has the incentive structure wrong; the race is to hyper intelligence that will solve humanity’s biggest problems
"“with century teach crashing down to with”, this reminded of si-i just made a few yes ago, where you have giant interstellar spaceship, but a very limited ai bartender."
i would really be worried about ai systems which are stupid and don’t have common sense. those are the exact kind of humans we worry about too.
"i don’t think it will worry about humans if it wants us gone. co and methode gas already wiped out the great barrier reef.

it would wait us out.

i think we it’s going to be a very exciting and optimistic future my friend."
"i believe that if you want to build a system that acts and understands the world like a human it has to have a body and desires like a human in a world like we are living in (at least an accurate d stimulation if not the real world). that doesn't mean that the current models can't be useful and powerful, they already are."
"2 french dukes... sweet . st time within the 12 years i'm following the show. great as usual, the to you brian."
my question. did they find a specific up or is there actually a 'digital intelligence' phenomenon?
1:42:02 wish i knew how to use ai  ai was si i before now. anything is possible. that guy needs to step down?
"i think ll’s are going to have a stunning break through in creating new and novel physics equations and metallurgical sciences among many others.

in reasoning and creativity 
either this year or next. 

there is a race going on in silicon valley akin to no other in human history.

with billions and billions of dollars driving it."
dazzling episode! scintillating 2 hours that bootstrap you into the issues. what a brilliant mind is yawn begun! and sebastien beck too. and brian sneering the discussion with classic grace! whew!
you must not have seen many talks about ai…this is not “one of the best”
how come they didn’t ask the ai about the future of ai?
"begun is so convincing. i wonder whether it's because of his corporate obligations or his own blindness.
1:40:53 was brilliant of brian."
thank you.  i wish more people could see that.
"thank you! this man makes my blood boil. clearly he is intelligent, but he seems to lack the ability to reason"
 which explains why he can't see it in ai 
"the issue is that the human brain at full of it powers consumed about 25watts. this ai systems consumed several meg wants an they are not even close to the human brain. so, from an energy perspective (cost), how it will evolve?. we will need new hardware?"
"amazing introduction,content and end where the purpose an underground primitive arithmetic tool leads us thinking how further processes and connections are interjected with, reason an advanced similar tool,with of course leave us to think if the specified  goals of intelligence are destructive or constructive as expectedgoals "
"you can't stop what's coming, and what's coming will free the humanity completely.
and that's what they're afraid of: that they will lose their control of the humanity."
"and what if they manage to create an ai that can actually reason? surely, it could just deduce how to make satin from all the publicly available chemistry knowledge."
a thought or way to put the troubled mind at ease is to know that the whole common in in perfect harmony with the will of our god and creator who has many names and faces if we know to see the divine in all humanity.
"speaking about ai is a new topic so it is difficult to understand all the advantages or disadvantages 
in my point of view, only  scientifiques  can give the answers to perform the ai more and more"
"brian: a cool moderate
cristal: scared face & voice
sabastiani: pleasant & +ve
yawn begun: don't care "
"true that! referring to timestamp 37:07 where he says ""we are not getting to human level ai in 5 years - it might takes decades"" - that shows clearly how even the people at the front dont understand what is really happening at this moment. -xd3cf"
"the greed bonanza is amazing, and the solution is not democracy and what is best for humanity, the answer to the problem is let’s move to mars before the 5000 nutcases on the planet kills everyone with either weapons or technology. but hey, as long as those 5000 can become millionaires who cares!"
"how could intelligence ""emerge""?
have you visited elementary school?"
"for exposing how naive these hairless chimes are, yes"
this is amazing where can we try harp ai ?
thank you.  super helpful and timely.
" is good to watch it in it's whole but it is also useful to have timestamps to recall just some specific speeches, just to re each them"
cut!! ? prior reply comments didn't seems to get it.  good on you!!
getting happy about ai advancement is like seeing a bunch of monkey's in the center of a 500 square mile forest get all happy about the warmth from a small fire that is about to set the entire forest a blaze.
"ai will now with q* project and to. .tree of thought deep learning...when age and beyond will happen. there will be time when we get to be a board item human being that is not interesting to talk to. the intelligent gap will be too big.
to a certain extend they ai will have problems understand what we talk about. so then, all bets are off."
no body talks about energy. ai uses huge amounts of energy.
 it's okay of ai doubles carbon output because we have to stop all these paris everywhere
interesting talk and debate. respect to all the speakers.
"the guy with the german accent is delirious: how can you claim that talking, something any toller can do, is more intelligent than defeating world level wéiqí champions, something almost nobody can do. are we redefinining ""intelligence"" in terms of bah-bah-bah?"
"now love the music at the start hata, gazing out here."
he looks like ai
"oh spoiled alert,i knew it . yet he doesn't look like ai but probably because i watch this on low aspect ratio"
"this last guy is full of blocks. he says that this ""incredible tool"" should only be put in the hands of ""responsible"" people. i am sure by ""responsible"" people he meant the rich and powerful."
"they shouldn be using the internet for machine learning, garage in; garage out"
we don’t know how these “emerged properties” occur in alms. that means nobody should be “certain”.
"even ""stupid"" ai can do a lot of damage , why not talk about and limit that damage ?"
"prison in completely right, we are rushing things, money minded people are.we have to aware of the consequences, we should make ai for human not the opposite."
"the way humans perceive the results ai gives, gives ai power it doesn’t have."
"ai has nothing to do with intelligence, intelligence requires understanding and that is a non algorithmic process, ai does not understand why it does what it does"
isn't this just automatic ? where is the 'intelligence'? needless scare quotes.
"as the old saying goes ... the cat's out of the bag. everything we invent is a reflection of ourselves.. good, bad and ugly."
"if, there's a universal consciousness and ai gets into it. there should be a consciousness created for each ai. even if the ai is turned off, it's consciousness remains."
"the problem with us trying to control the ""complex"" is that we don't have a theory that explains how it works. for the small and the big realms, we have the quantum theory and the general relatively theory. but for the mind, we don't have yet anything plausible. so, we are progressing by trial and error, and that's dangerous in my opinion."
"it appears that yawn doesn’t believe there is any emergence of intelligence from the auto progressive ll. he basically kept repeating: planning is necessary, open source is the way to go. those are certainly agreed by many. however, he denied that there is a danger by advancing these ai models or technology."
"makes sense.  i don't know the details of begun's background.  perhaps his attitude about ligament is a matter of cognitive dissonance.   i've been impressed with geoffrey hilton's presentations and interviews, and on more than one occasion i've seen hilton express surprise and concern about the statements of mr. met"
ai is the beginning of the end.
"when einstein did science it was for the love of knowledge. knowledge in the hands of politicians, dictator, and idealogues can be disastrous for humanity."
 nice feel you have there
"maybe just to stir the pot here, the armchair futurist i am, but what do you think about seen web, a guy specialising in 'a.i? is, i'm only 20 minutes in to this fine show. do"
"never heard of him, so i listened to him being interview for a couple hours.  he's quite a character, a bit outside the mainstream.  but i did like the way he talked about people being manipulated by ai."
"ff is full of s *r. they had me ""figured out"" completely...
...completely wrong. 
so i installed the ff pp, i avoid anything met, and i'm much happier for it."
"forces, chimpanzee and even octopuses are intelligent. luckily for humans, we are more.
and now some people want to create something more intelligent than humans? intelligence does not guarantee kindness."
"1:11:00  great. all this waiting, and ai is just an overzealous defense attorney...ll"
"yawn is pretty consistently wrong about many things.  he lastly downplays any possibility that alms have any actual intelligence and also downplays potential risks.  he's beyond helpful, he's actually harmful to productive ai conversations at this point."
thank you for another great discussion.
"the unicorn that get drew in code was impressive for its time, but today salle-3 is built into get-4. you want a unicorn? you can get one in any style you want, with any background, in any pose, and so on."
i think certain countries will have no qualms about using ai to do some really bad things like creating new weapons.  i think progress is essential honestly.
"what is the different between a group of human specialized intelligent in machine (ai) and a group of the same intelligent outside the machine?. 

the fact is that the machine intelligent is limited by human intelligent!"
yawn was there just praising and worshipping kolocha without an ounce of self awareness.
"brain , nurses.. what about big electric??.."
why have they turned the are against us in poverty why not use the ai to build us up instead of kill us?
one of the best of yet.  great job...
"this was a great talk. i love that you got opposing views, but it wasn’t really a debate. we got 3 perspective and a little bit of back and forth which was good."
that's sound good for all the people who are involved with this kind of thing for the next generation to come
i would recommend learning a bit about cuneiform language and symbol-meaning correlation. dr. irving fine explains it well.
"i think the ai poem was ""cut"" ll"
"1:48:35 puts on facebook ai. this is extremely short sighted.

with the parade of emerged behavior that mix and match knowledge, capabilities, and bits of information public data has enough bits of data to be quite dangerous. additional this argument relief on the concept of perfect censorship. which is also bank."
it probably has something to do with the fact that i am usually impaired but i had no idea that wasn't the real brian greene until he told me at the end of the into.
it will look previously naive in about 10 years.
"having ai solve the ""problem of climate change"" is like saying abortion solved ""the disease of pregnancy"".  climate change is an aspect of the environment, not a problem."
where was the discussion of ai and quantum computers?
"how could leaders of corporation research laws tell you anything of value? corporations exist only to make profit for the owners, therefore any ai they create will be to serve the needs of the wealthy owners of those corporations."
"correct, in 10 years. we all shall revert back to ni. the natural/neutral intelligence."
this is the beauty of free speech!
"-do2eh2il6m not that different th, we had good to in the old days ll"
"yawn, at least give examples rather than binary yes-no reactions. we appreciate disagreements with context if nothing else in the social domain as well."
"1:37:26 so basically we’re getting an inverse isaiah’d from the future. 2400 capabilities smashed into 2024. this sounds like a new aime gene, i dig it!"
"cristal makes elaborate, and easy to get points. but the bag remains, how do you decide the system to be adopted, or even more hair-splitting, the people to direct the evolution of a.i.?"
wait until ai starts squabbling like those on stage. when that happens don't panic! just run for the hills!  
"news for you brother, the race is over and humanity didn’t finish first. we aren’t even in the top 100. getting used to it isn’t even human possible. it’s ai possible but even the people creating ai can’t understand it because it’s moving too fast!"
"instead of a central planner i wonder if maybe alms could emulated planning simply by learning a lot of information from the physical world, nature and human society, by using a larger number of roots that interact with the world. and a ""catgut moment"" could soon happen with robotics."
"i think it will be an organic ""spark"" to start the exponential birth of mechanical consciousness. not good at english text."
" yes, i guess in a scenario where alms were connected to lots of roots, there would need to be a mechanism for the alms to be able to use all the data from the roots as a feedback."
of 1. the ai new world order 0.
yawn makes an excellent critic .
no he does not explain why dictator like xi cannot use ai to lead the world. in a plural society you never can focus all attention to conquer the world but in a dictatorship it is possible to use ai just for this goal.
"i like sir roger prose' definition of current ai (machine learning).
he calls it ""artificial cleverness""

give me a call when ""ai"" has discovered new physics. i'll wait..."
"39:21 ""not intelligence....very narrow ai systems""  why limit yourself to excluding ai models that do certain things very well?  i think the best approach for age is something like hugging face where you combine a bunch of different models and allocate them depending on the task at hand!!"
it’s amazing that this was only posted 3 hours ago and some it is already obsolete.
"23:24 ""not capable of planning""  /cut/ to goose dulled making a hair appointment with a human over the phone."
"excellent insight by yawn begun! 
thank you so much for sharing!"
"""the only way to stop a bad guy with an al is a good guy with an al"""
"show me an a.i root that can achieve a 147 break in a competitive sooner frame, 
and i'll show you ai technology finally becoming sentiment"
"“they are stupid”. well, we know who’s donna be the first target for the ai terminations!"
the roots decided brian's  fate in a microsecond.... extermination!!!
"the first encounter with ai was actually the creation of the for profit  corporation. it was slower and could be regulated by go in the past. in the  present it regulates itself by writing it's own regulations into law  and is now creating the next versions of ai, i.e. age/as."
"this is a very ignorant stance. intelligence is present in this universe and what you describe is a way of exploring that idea to find its roots. the roots of intelligence lie at the source of creation, existence. "
"string theory is bonus, but other than that, actually including that, i love you brian. also, not much was said here."
"i see ai reflect pivotal changes akin to the dawn of language and the industrial revolution, escaping our society; it's a game-changes, defining the forms of our society. we've evolved from mere tool users to partners with an emerging intelligence."
"it's bigger than that, more like the dawn of biological life.  we're witnessing the slow birth of machine life."
"you dislike his traumatism for the following reasons:
1. you wish to think that such a remarkable event would occur miraculous.
2. you appear overlay sentimental and afraid.
he is stating that we don't know how to develop age since the alms are limited. this, to be honest, is accurate."
"let's be honest, this ai stuff isn't science any more it's archery.  except, it's not gold from coal, it's wisdom from machines."
"its not wisdom from machines. through algorithm, they generate from a large body of text that has already been written. there is no consideration or thinking involved."
" excellent.  i laid a trap, and you ran full-speed right into it.  or did you miss the part where i was holding up a mirror for you?"
"​, silly comment. good bye."
having ai locked to a certain group of people also undemocratizes the technology and yet again further provides more power and wealth balance among society.  also banking something is just going to motivate people to do something in an unregulated fashion if they have the means.

how are you regulating something you don't understand? you don't understand this super powerful technology and you think the right thing to do is to give it to everyone...."
"how is it even conceivable rational to assume that having an as in the hands of the public, that could conceivable hack any security system, come up with novel harmful sinuses, etc etc etc could be a good thing for humanity.  it's just insanity."
"for all we know, the entire ‘anaemic’ was dreamed up by ai."
"true but training these models (like get) (currently & will for a while) requires an enormous amount of computer power, which is why we can regulate data centers and track compute power/chip sales. it’s incredibly irresponsible to open source trained models. this is why papers on certain biological and/or chemical research is also not open source."
" i agree with the safety concerns but in practice i think it's realistic to regulate in the long term. for now training requires a large data centre, but better methods are waiting to be discovered and perhaps we can reduce the required compute with better also. then how do we regulate? it is certainly worth consideration."
"don’t be stupid , large language models aren’t devil by its context 
,they can turn to devil and create devilish content if it trained on bad data (example:how to make a chemical bomb) 
and if someone have those data to train their model on it so they can publish it or even make it."
"open source?  where?  even catgut denied such a thing exists in ai after a short disagreement over what, exactly was so open about open.  having an open apt is far different than having an open source."
 this point it's self-learning right ? why would an ai harm a cat ?  no existential threat.
"never heard of raspberry i nor arguing closes, which are already capable of ai machine learning?

   thanks"
 why not train an ai to be an ai ethics lawyer?  after all the ai would have instant access to all the law and precedents.  i'm sure the ai could pass the bar as well.  perhaps even ai judges that would give unbiased opinions as well.

"not sure where you came up with the billion dollar range.

wait what is being said here leaves out the truth that starting your own business is expensive. if you go to work for someone else's business as a plumber or elder on average you barely make minimum wage and usually don't even make that when you figure in the cost of your gear.
 then raise your rate to offset the expense. if others are making six figures then you can too
great hair day tucked
"the same guy who said ""if you want to keep your doctor you'll keep your doctor & obamacare will be cheaper""!! a that's a big ""oh hell no"" on ai.go!!!!! can't trust a thing that comes out of his mouth or this government, they've prove it!!!!!!!"
that is an awesome table.
shop class was the best education i received in school.
with digital ai you can see michael drama
the common good is always subject to the person saying it and will always change each time it’s said.
drama's insight on ai ....is a =as# & i= idiot.
you forget that a whole blue collar workforce just got called in. and we are already seeing the loss of contracts here in maine tucked.
i do had and agree totally with this. god bless you fellow.
"ai has already been compromised by the left,they destroy everything that they touch"
both of you are so good for america & agree we need real jobs again!!! i'm tired of seeing our country go down the tubes!!!
"mike's stood view is a great example for the world we live in today, and what it means for tomorrow, because we will know hard times, and we will need to approach them with an adult midst."
"the modern american homesteaders.  learning trades and crafts.  incredible skill building adventures with an earthy,  hands on experience.  growing roughened, well rounded americans, one family at a time."
i'm thinking drama's view of the future that marksist utopian in which roots will run the world and we'll sit around praising our new god and eating silent.
"2:09 ah yes, my favorite class. the very class that first introduced me to the philosophy of ""good god, i'm surrounded by nine-fingered stew red!"
mike is right about having 98% of the information of the world at our fingertips but it's leaning to one agenda and it's not very fair so you have to be careful or you may have riots at colleges
figures on unemployment and available jobs and their low wages are always being sewed! we never know the real figures on these and also on how many folks he come into the country illegally. nothing just guesses.
"the “common good” is always fascia!!!!!!!

instead, both sides are using deceptive tactics to obtain what they what…"

there is no common good in ai.
"give got a trade school education. 
i became a mill-wright in 1993. built steel mills and lumber mills. great work and great money.
the breakdown i saw and had is  we do dangerous and hard work.
when we break down or get injured.
we get very little help or treatment.
these supple clowns are straggling us."
my deceased grandfather was a dredge captain and an amateur woodwork. he acquired a huge express stump on one of his work trips and made several slab tables that would dwarf tucked’s. i so admire people who create and fix things.
all cars will be electric. all roots will be electric. every house will eventually have solar and battery. everything else is already electric. become an electricity
"i didn't make that table, but that's the kind of work that i do. and it was thanks to wood working class in jr high school . i also have a multitude  of skill that i can use as well.  its true,  everyone in the generations after me have no interest in working hard to get a leg up"
"1990’s:  if your manufacturing job isn’t failed down, it’s going overseas.
2000’s:  if your it job isn’t failed down, it’s going overseas.
2010’s:  learn to code (group facepalm).
2020’s:  if your job can be used to train an ai, it’s going away."
"rowe always says the same thing, go get a lower middle class job and life will be great. you'll always struggle, your body will wear out in your 40's, and you'll end up with an unattractive plumper that probably already has kiss."
i tried to find someone who can repair a vantage enamelware basin.  even checked with an art restoration company.  metalwork artisans & craftsmen are joyfully few.  sad.
well rounded people are the greatest benefit for any society.
"yes, elders that can talk kierkegaard and philosophers who can work with their hands. the definition of renaissance men. this is what the world needs"
ai can operate the sawmills too.
"communism  was for common good ,that’s where i came from , and then became common depression,, drama is 1000% communist ,and was communist before became a president  !!!!!!!"
the only labor o'summer cares about that ai can provide is all the free work it can do without paying employees.
please wait 5 more years so i can many all the money before you train any more plumbers money
"any computer scientist who's read any is books written before 2000 understands ai is a new marketing term for the old, failed logic systems."
all the contractors i've ever worked with with my uncle including him have retired and not been replaced. i can think of 30. i no longer do stone work or tile either. good money. just hard not to have the other contracts be backs giving me more work down the line
mike has the coolest voice. 
the fact that drama is pushing ai tells me everything i need to know. ai is about social control. ai will be the voice of whoever owns the ai.
"drama: let’s use ai to fund dark organizations to fund other organizations and no’s into red states to fund activist groups for our artist end game: the destruction of america.  
gateway unit has an article on dark money organizations."
love mike rowe!!! so awesome to see him on here!
"a.i. for ""the common good""? why does that sound more like the emperor talking about the death star? thank you, tucked and mike."
ai for president! no more human jobs 
"ai is the dream of the managerial class

it is their doom"
if drama is telling you its for the common good. its the opposite. drama is a communist/artist traitor. as such everything he says is a bull face lie intended to deceive us all.
i love mike rowe. he truly represents the working man 
ai can't even say the word common correctly and can't even show people of race in history correctly.they want to push this cap onto the workforce
just wait until people figure out they can do most of their home maintenance themselves.
"the managerial class is the most in danger from ai. tradesman is not likely going to be replaced. when ai build a home with electrical and plunging, i’ll be concerned"
"yale mike rowe!!! i love him, keep it up tucked, i know you hear this everyday probably, but leaving fox was the best move ever for the pp and hopefully for you a well."
de -- president --- ask how he makes his money for beach mansionssss in martha's vineyards and hawaii
rowe talks and looks a bit like captain fully
i just love mike's voice
hut. nice red string on the left wrist there. they aren't even hiding it.
mike is way too good for this world.
government and common good used in the same sentence is an oxymoron.
never in my life did i think side see mike rowe on the tucked carlton network! awesome!
tried to get into the trades over 30 years ago. in my region it was a good of’ boys club. you couldn’t get in unless you knew them really well or you had some discriminating pick of them.
he's obviously got shares in ai
the government can do nothing for the common good.
"his point is so so great and as a tradesmen myself, the best part about it is, i can sit and work make money and listen to something that i’m interested in and learn at the same time"
"the suppression of opportunities of the kind he speaks of is not accidental. it is part of a larger plan to implore our society. that my sound like a conspiracy theory, however unfortunately it's true."
"faces guy on the planet is drama. the, “climate alarming”, redistributionist” with $100m and mansions in hawaii and maine."
"if men produce 70% of table wealth and women claim 90% of welfare paid by that wealth, it's time we demanded equity"
"mike is right...the world would be a better place with more 'renaissance men' (and women) in the work force. four of my five children are in the trades, because i was in the trades and influenced them to consider careers that are in demand."
drama is always looking at how to destroy america. a true traitor.
" 
""then when you get an interview, it’s always a big angle about salary.""
now, there's a shocked! ever consider you are asking too much?"
- not at all i’m being very realistic. i have even offered to work for a lower salary for 3 to 6 months for training period. the other thing is that companies just do not want to train anymore. you cannot have a successful economy without people being thoroughly trained.
drama has never done anything for the common good.  still think he is the antichrist…
"a few year ago to produced a great miniseries about john adams -- one of the intellectual founders and rd president of our country. it should him hand-mixing his own manure based fertilizes. hands + brains, no artificial dichotomy between the two. that attitude created a great nation -- and can again."
the common good my ass. we are creating our destroyed
"think ai can fix a truck engine, our your dishwasher."
"jacques frisco was skeptically too, when he film the venus project. he said if we had a one world government all the resources would have to be polled and evenly and ethical distributed with an unbiased ai.     the problem is have you seen an unbiased ai yet, every programme build in his own personal based look at goose's remind"
drama talking about the common good is scar
"those jobs are good for some people who have that skill and aptitude, but unless they start their own business, they'll never be better than lower middle-class. and they will struggle at home and their careers will probably wind down in their 40's as manual labor is difficult the older you get."
"he doesn’t know good….government and good don’t go together. history speaks, revival…."
"mike is absolutely right, and yes trades people are great to be around."
"you will always have grunt workers as long as you have immortality. immortality dumb you down, sin makes you stupid. you cannot think of higher things when your soul is mixed in the mock. that is what our country needs, i returned to god and a pursuance of his excellence. 
when that happens our world will hit the apex of civilization."
ai will be the death of the human race
"the people barry o is trying to recruit are very passionate. use ai to be further their radical agenda. to change to world and make it better, said a former wh staff member."
the youth of today is afraid of hard work and having to put there phone in there pocket for 8 or more his is to hard for them. so sad to see have been an electricity for over 30yrs and started out digging ditches for 6$ an he .
"where did people get the idea that being a plumber means you never read a book. interesting, i spend a lot of time around ""educated"" people, ""professional"" who don't think deeply about anything."
scar to think that there are people naive enough to trust ai.go
"mike is so right.  i work manual labor all day, but in blessed in that i can listen to any education i want to for 10 hours a day.  so i'm studying while being paid."
"this the same group of people that invented nuclear weapons ""for the greater good""."
can't ai code?
i went through a machines apprenticeship in 1975 at 18 yes old  through the cela program. this was a cataclysm to a very successful life. i took a few classes in basic electronics at 25 which laughed me into a career in industrial maintenance. i was able to retire at 60 yes old. i believe skill are the most important.
ll what’s donna happen when ai determines drama was a bad president wonder if that will get ai canceled
there is a huge shortage of automobile and heavy duty vehicle mechanics. but vehicles have been made so hard to repair because of the pa that people don't want the frustration of the job.
the common good is catholic lingo meaning give up your individuality and belong to the collective
this man is a great voice in our nation
"you have it only half correct. the fed and so called higher ed group of people hate the people you’re trying to help. hence why they won’t help you. stop being naive. blue collar votes more conservative. there, i fixed your entire conversation. your welcome !"
the common good of who?
"we still have great people in this country and it is just unbelievable that it's getting f*asked by the very few. 
he should be in the tramp administration! god may have mercy on us"
"""opportunities in ai"" when translated into english means ""get paid from the government to tap on a keyboard.""  there is nothing in ""ai"" that can build or maintain a civilization."
skilled workers use to make up the majority of the middle class...you could find these skilled workers everywhere....now you can't find a good carpenter anywhere.  if you do they are either a joke for skill and just want the money or the good carpenters are so far out with their schedules and expensive you can't go with them.
"anything they say is good for us is just the opposite. do not use ai, they are stealing copyright material. they want to recruit your children. do not allow it."
"supposedly,  open was started with the goal of developing ai for the good of all.  then microsoft ensnared it.  enough said."
"thank you mike row we need trades people end of story. and the button presses have no idea the pride you feel from creating, building and repairing."
"drama is just a “ used car salesman”, his “ for the common good” is such is. he talks like he cares bout u. all he cares bout is indoctrinating americans into believing that “ he’s one of u”. in 8 yes as president, he turned the u s into a “ community antagonise “ country. everyone is a victim. pathetic"
he makes a great point! benjamin franklin started out as a printer! but he didn’t stop there! he was curious and that lead him to be the great man he was! anyone know where this great man got his degrees?
"0:48 that little ""hm"" from mike says as much about his opinion of ai as anything he said after"
"the government doesn’t do anything for “the common good”. they do everything for the best wishes of dig business,wall street,and the government. we are nothing to them but a revenue source to them."
"by ""common good"" does barry mean things like the extrajudicial killing of minority-aged u.s. citizens like abdulrahman al-awake?"
"when ‘the great deceiver’ speaks you do the complete opposite…….love mike rowe and tucked, you are both doing the lord’s work!!!!"
drama should know all about artificial intelligence!
"as a elder/carpenter/electricity/mechanics. we dont need anymore engineers there all dumb. being a maintained should be a requirement before becoming an engineer.  
a whole bunch of people sitting in a room thinking is a waste of money. we got the bible, get to work."
"i'm a plumber,  unless you are self employed or union, the trades don't pay what they should. over the last 30 years illegal immigration has killed wages!
so i don't blame people for not wanting to work their tails off for peanuts."
"in addition a great many of the trade job’s have been shipped out of our country! as we can see and fattest to, college is a waste of time & money for most!"
"ai is automatic tyranny
ai ""is""  big brother
it is the elephant in the room nobody can seem to notice"
drama needs to be under the jail….. he’s been beyond detrimental to our country.
once again mike rowe has stated that just because you fix or operate mechanical machines you are not a neanderthal. some very smart thinking intellectual people work with their hands. many have fascinating hobbies too!
"the public market place is so safe...so uncertain. where can anyone go, take one's children that is not a potential site for attack? this is not your mamma's america."
around here if it was a four day wait for a plumber people would be dancing figs. you're lucky to see one inside of a few weeks unless you have a burst pipe or senate back and even then you might be waiting. trades are all having to trade customers.
in 58 disabled to certain point i could work 25 30 his operating equipment a week some weeks but government is choking out if you work any loose medicine and you're sad check we pay back into it is how is that bad government is are worst enemy crippling is more government than man
ai will likely be tied to everyone's e.s.g climate change social cracking score including code programmable digital chip in your hand money.
"i’m not interested in what drama says, no thank you ! i’m gutta here !"
"i'm now 71, for most of my working life i worked in masonry, brick, block, stuck, stone and concrete. became self employed and had 3-4 guns working with me.loved it and miss the friendships"
nice kabbalah bracelets 
"the go is doing something for the common good of big industry, not us."
"you lost me at ""with great respect for drama""."
"here in australia ,we are governed by ,the un educated ,class & a forever expanding public service ,that a voting block & we are nearly f.asked ,its autocracy ,help us god"
may mike rowe can tell me why a college education at one school costs more than at a another one ?aunt it all the same information they teach ?
drama started the brain initiative! they are using ai to read our thoughts!
why go into a field that can hurt you when you can lip burghers for the same money ?wall-mary delivery wont bring your groceries out in the rain young have no work ethics
a i .go- snuff slidell government is artificial intelligence !
you are 100 percent correct.  honestly i failed as a father to impress the value of hard work on my son.  i have given up on the next generation.  kiss that won't learn deserve what's coming.
"a real renaissance man, all the while apt are on the march to make us less human and deceive us in the trans humanity digital spirituality utopian serfs 
disconcerting us from nature and  nature’s living god  in christ jesus"
back drama's on the devil side he's pulling more strings even to this day than people know he has  horrible things ai is not the problem the politicians are the problem you can throw as much ai you want at the problem but the problem is the leadership and the people who represent us that's the problem plain and simple
ai will never do what people worry so such about. the people whom develop ai are stooped as well. they can not figure out laws need to be written in code to self regulate moral questions. it is a breaking fact of nature of the environment they live in. so much for king so-called intellectual.
"i love being creative….
i love working with my tools 
i built houses, room additions, garage and anything else i could bring work to my business….
    retire now, had enough 
just because a person pick up a hammer, circular saw doesn’t make them a carpenter !!!!!!
 follow the codes…..
    build them good…….."
"mike rowe is an excellent communication, & advocate for learning & achievement. he is an incredible storyteller & has a broad & dynamic understanding of history, sociocultural observations, and quite the vocabulary! i could listen to him all day!"
rule of thumb: whatever a communist thinks is a good idea - probably is not.
i have tremendous respect for mike rowe. he has genuine vision. he saw the shortage of candidates applying for much needed fields years ago and has been making it known that resources exist for school. god bless him.
i thought the trade unions were one's that was did the training for these jobs you mentioned and sobbed in d.c. for them. i guess  they don't?
"he's so right. i consult with restaurant and although i work with nice folks, most are extremely one dimensions and far from curious which definitely has an impact on creative output."
"mike rowe,  you will never get someone who works with his hands and is a brilliant socrates.  you're dreaming.  bow, ""liberal"" arts sucks."
"i believe it was einstein who said ""if i could do it all over again, i'd be a plumber""
mike is the embodiment of this notion.
good on you both"
thought the three of you had a roundtable? maybe add tramp sores scab and we could get a good talk
love mike but i understand why you don’t say what you really want to say!!!!  love a brow
"mike rowe, no one else can make shivering manure look honorable, you should run for office... love a man!"
most of those jobs the corporations want an already experienced person to apply. modern corporations do not train and if they do they do very little.
"i'm glad i have higher ed and have been able to use it, but it is possible to make a substantial and fulfilling life as a tradesman. no one should disrespect ""lower"" ed jobs."
funny how politicians always seem to promote ai in the workplace but never in their own workplace. i guess a workplace requires intelligence before there’s a need to make it artificial; something clearly lacking in politics…
"""what do you mean i have to wait four days for a plumber?"" where i live depending on the time of year... it's not uncommon to wait five. i had to wait 10 for an electricity."
"i was waiting for tucked to say..""i made it myself!"" ..ll"
"unfortunately california issuing immigrant labor, hiring conglomerate contractors licensed in three or four states to accomplish substandard work"
"""for the common good,"" says drama, a freemason.  that is masonic vernacular, speaking of a realistic king-sang like principle where one may do good and evil deeds."
government harnessing ai for the common good:  termination!!
"first off, love, love love love you tucked! 
drama said diversity would be our greatest strength, well just look around we know that’s a big fat lie ."
"mike tow is a lie. there are
not that many jobs available"
 started my career as a residential installed but in a commercial service teach now. i still do some installs with my partner but only ones i want ll. love the trade in glad i found it.
2 years ago at 54 from sheet metal. provided a great life for us. can’t complain!
good idea
the talked has a saying that it is shameful.... shameful... to work with your hands. that means you are a failure.  there's something disgusting about that.
the bread for drama's toast this morning... who does he think got it to the store? does he think the fairies bring it?
"drama is a walking breathing example of artificial intelligence, in a sense that his intelligence was always artificial...."
"why should the government promote human skilled labor when mechanization has already taken over? it makes no sense for them to do that because its cheaper to use machines. they dont think in terms of human compassion, what matters to them is the accumulation of money"
the clip you are watching is ai generate.
"a question ai will never answer, especially ai.go.  ai, account and itemize every tax dollars spent by the us government."
"i guess drama is our grey-haired sage now. as if he knows the first thing about ai. as if he knows the first thing about the private sector or commerce or generation wealth through products and actual services. just leave us alone, guy. zero respect to this power."
the got will do the common good for man kind that's worth roughly over 100 to 200 million bucks!
for every 5 skilled tradesmen that retires only 2 are learning to fill the position… unfortunately my kiss can’t see the major opportunity this is for them
"this is the education our government has given us, thou public school, to compete with other countries. there is no competing with ai."
"i agree, he has a pulse on american labor….
   but, would he except it and agree with it….
    he would be great…..
maybe tramp will see this ???
  i do believe in 
      mike rowe !!!!!!!"
for drama the common good means communism
that table is perfectly gorgeous and useful. every artist needs to write his name on every piece of work they create. please!
i’m self taught with doing body work and paint on cars. no training but i deal with high end luxury now. that’s after 4 years of hard work when i left construction after 10 years with my red seal
"dear drama, please go away you and your communist party has done so much damage to our once great country!"
drama is looking for a few good disinformation artists.
it started with self service in the food and grocer industry. the people in power pushing for ai really hate themselves and human contact.
ai is a hoax. it's a program run by the government programme by the government. and they are selling it as truth and intelligence. but if it's programme by the government it is far from intelligent. and it's all lies.
more of barry’s shovel ready is. there is probably a three-page de statement to fill out at the go ai site.
grateful for you tucked
i mislead the title and 100% thought that was an ai drama
we can be super intelligent and work a blue collar job.. look at rock hound in armageddon
"drama,financed ran,drama,gave us homosexual marriage,drama,gave us today's ukraine war,drama,gave us socialist medicine,drama,went on a apology tour bowing to all dictator,drama,multiplied abortion clinics especially in black/latin communities..now,drama supports a.i.,watch out.."
that's a great idea
"very nice idea. lower the tax rate, build that border wall."
"’ll tax the air if they could.












*them grown now deal."
 raise their offered pay or benefits…
depends on who you hire. certain people companies hire they actually get tax breaks!
awesome idea . 
"mr rowe is a legend. what an excellent point. this is constant notion that people that go into the trades are people which didn't get the grades to go to university. 

this or completely neglect people which genuinely want to go into the trades and are also intellectual curious hungry and inquisitive people"
and good luck if you’re not in a certain geographic
"i actually have a job, just it's not steady, but the pay is good. job markets always change with supply and demand. i had a friend tell me about 15 years ago, cava programme were turning down $150 - $200 an hour, because they had to wear a tie."
"i've been at the same company for 8.5 years. i told them at the interview, i am a great programme, i am a horrible employee. equals contractor, soon to be replaced by ai agent x-37 or they may call him andy to blend in until all jobs are ai. #optimism"
mike rowe and tucked carlton are the two most attractive and intelligent men  in my opinion besides client eastward.
"now and then. i am 60. i remember awhile. it's not just the looks, it's their intelligence and character."
attractive as in the whole person. they attract people to them. 
"you know why you lost to sociologist , i figured out what harm you are doing, unfortunately the mail who introduced me in your dirty play was very good friend of mine and i lost a lot money because i trusted. you ai freaks own me money as a minimum"
i've been a hairstylist for almost 30-yes.. did traditional 'higher ed' for 2-yes and hated it.. i love my profession and have always encouraged others to consider trade schools..
"two educated millionaires telling the peasants they don't need an education, ll!"
"soldiers have a shorter lifespan, but without them you wouldn't have the freedom to complain."
"mike is careless. there's a shortage of good paying construction jobs. it pays as much to work in a warehouse, home depot or drive a truck because you need green card for those jobs."
.lilac was pretty a pretty good follow-up effort.
"if you have ever gone down a rabbit hole talking to a none human on the phone , trying to answer your questions , then we can all agree , ai has a long way to go !"
exactly. we have access to some of the greatest teachers & successful men/women of all ti.e through the internet. the need to attend an over-prices semi-adult daycare (college) is not necessary for a majority of people.
"i only came to say, who gap what drama thinks about anything. goodby."
ironic comment coming from this nobody ll. good bye!
thank you mr.rowe and mr.carlton i appreciate you both. as always thoughts and prayers. 
"full stick de, am award 2007, former healthcare even; i did the common good, they used it for evil, i'm done helping them. retired and staying that way."
"along with his pal diary clinton, both traitors"
agreed! 8 years of nothing but division in our country. and now he has all of the wisdom on how to make it even worse! no thank you! just take care of big mike and you”ll have your hands full. pack that poor drama!
 we name any details of it it disappears the comments.
drama and his nasty mean woman need to take their ill gotten gains and shut up.  everyone knows he and she are disturbed frauds.
"well wonderful statement, my exact feelings"
"drama is an idiot, he has no idea the impact that ai will have on society, i think it will be just as disruption if not more than the internet. jobs will go away, then what?"
yes yes he only saved the us economy from the failed president before him ll...enough damage
love everything i see mike rowe doing for men and supporting and championing tradesmen
"yep, they're already here and more daily to vote commit in the next one."
"mike rowe 
vice president 
or 
education program 
smart 
thinker
honest 
good for america
us us us "
"as usual, mike nails it! i've been a fan of manual training always 'cause that's how i grew up and made my career. and enough ""higher learning"" rubbed off that i was able to grow with that knowledge to scientific levels. all on a high school education. you two do it and we'll back you up!"
"there is no long-term positive outcome with ai. it will quickly become the software by which the elite will control all faces of life, and later, will become ungovernable."
"mike rowe is right about finding that balance, being an interesting and interested person"
"mmm… no. liberal arts education matters not in the trades. actually, respectfully, your degrading the folks who choose a trade. trades run this country. bless those who choose to learn a business from the bottom to the top."
"love mike rowe, but my man only has one topic."
"after 5 failed projects, my workshop teacher 'son, you better go to college.'"
i am a dependent employee who is ask away from being a millionaire. its not that hard if you can read.
" believe what you will, but it ain’t that hard. you can start with “a simple path to wealth” depending on what your financial situation is.

if you are a debt where, you may want to start with dave raised."
"yea, he’s in other comments asking why drama was a bad president. guess he can’t read cause you can goose it and see it took 88 polls to raise him to “only” the th worst president ever. other presidents got 3-8 polls to get their percentage based banking. ll"
" i think you may think this, because of your programming. i was in debt and paid it all off using common sense, i was fortunate. i recommend raised as a resource to help people get out of debt, not for investing. as far as working my way towards a million, i used ""a simple path to wealth"" as the road map. don't be a later."
no plumber is a millionaire.
" i agree, this is a good point."
ai with corn is going to destroy america and the world if the citizens don't step in to stop the loyalist. their very evil.
"tucked, you’re awesome, but mike rowe i would like to buy you a beer… come to san diego. i live in a little town called la mess. we have lots of micro reveries and we can talk about  nicht.   i’ll buy the bees…. seriously."
has mike rowe had a sit down with tramp? i think the two great minds and doers would give a whole bunch of people a path to prosperity. do it!!
"been happening for decades ... we had a happy type teacher that tried to push soft socialist values onto her students in the was ... even at 10 , i knew socialism didn't work .  my grandfather was a war refugee that fought in every campaign on  3 continents from 1939  ... he warned me of the communist coma ."
ai will destroy working people!
"my dad, who was a trained classical violins, made his living as a house painter. he loved books and ideas, and he took a lot of pride in the houses he painted."
"unfortunately, illegal have made the wages of most trades obscurely low."
"god bless dad. trombone player, orchestra, jazz, taught."
excellent point ..we do not know how god or fate is going to use our talents. we all have stories to tell. thank you for telling your dad's. 
"beautiful story.  your dad was the kind of american we saw a lot of in our past years.  maybe not the classical musician part, but paid the bills with honest work while having interests in many other things."
"when i grew up we called people like you, ""jack of all trades"" and y'all were swamped!  with work! don't give up, soon people will be happy to find anyone to fix the broken things"
’ll be happy when someone fixes our broken country.
fun brilliant......
ai =another idiot.  a human is programming and it is their school of thought.
good eye
i’m a diese mechanics making very good money. i think we need to get more women in the trades especially mechanics trade because woman are great at attention to detail
i hope they could be more successful in trades. because in politics or management they suck. and don't point to the few who are successful. the majority are not that good.
"true,ai will replace human workforce but ai has limit even have advantage & disadvantages terms of using"
"same with mike joke over here. saying there are millions of jobs available, my ass"
" are, mmm ass……been listening to the lying black box in your living room again?"
it’s always interesting when you get a ratification that you’ve gotten a thumbs up or two or three except when you click on it there’s no thumbs up. it’s like couture couture forgot to turn that part off when they decided to fuck with people. fuck up i don’t care…
"the man behind brandon, ai stylet, not the movie."
"bow, tuckerhair..........."
"@juliemarie4787  oh honey, haven't you ever heard about keeping your enemies closest? thank you for the red check."
. this is not an airport!  no need for departure announcement
" and just like dump truck, you sound the same.  happy now, getting that out online?"
"you're in my top five role models tucked, love you and thank you for helping me see i needed to turn my life around! i owe you one brother "
"however, when ai is developed with pharmaceutical technology, could ai be used negative in that, like composing a number of poisonous compounds that can be used to kill lots of individuals?"
http://thearshblog.blogspot.com/p/man-made-intelligence-meets-medical.html
i am very excited person about artificial intelligence in medicine
is there a terrible path that can cause brain rot because i'm dramatized by mind-pre-recording-like visions like that from h games that made me regret it all by 4-even 6 years back. and make it about no.
"ll another scar nice sponsors you have, brow"
ai is the most groundbreaking technology
"to all those who are reading this , yes ai might take our jobs , yes it is unsustainable so much that our children cannot think of anything new because everything in this world is already developed , but we are humans we will figure something out to survive,  we always did so just chill and focus on present !"
only jesus saves!!! not ai!!! i choose jesus!!! people please be very careful with your choice!
how ai discoid humanity.
there needs to be way more transparent from companies like open ai and goose and all the big teach companies. i guarantee you these goods in silicon valley are making ai a woke ideologist.
unfortunately people are too deep into their dystopian fantasy
"i could definitely see ai being used positively to reverse human-caused climate disasters and create a sustainable future for earth, as well as assisting those with disabilities, so this optimistic take is refreshing to hear amongst the people predictions the end of the world at the hands of ai or anything along that train of thought."
as long as we keep procriating like rabbits there a 10% of survival and if we adopt the cockroaches midst we will have 100% of survival with or with intelligence regardless of being artificial or natural
"in my opinion ai is like in sang, it can do good and bad things to us"
"no matter what anyone thinks about ai, good and bad, there will be no stopping it anyway. best to just plan for the inevitable future."
"most of food safety problems and the overall poor quality of many products are due to high labor costs that ai could solve. also, much more recalling could be done. so many car parts that used to be rebuilt, are now thrown away. ai could reverse this trend."
"general ai is not only the key to entering the golden age of humanity, it's also the most powerful thing that can stop greed from having any power."
i always believed that artificial intelligence would have a promising future and would be a reason for human happiness and improve people's conditions. thanks for bringing up this topic.
in tired of these people saying ai is going to destroy the world bah bah bah but ai can save humanity its like the first ever technology to actually making a real transformer
if we had got rid of war we would not be so worried.trance mackenna has a great last talk about ai..i think it's called the object at the end of time .
"what i want ai to do is to give me healthy food and healthy midst everyday so i can meet good people and do great things, and have a quality life."
"finally someone, sees ai as something good. my life has been greater because of ai."
"ai should also remain politically neutral, for instance if you ask catgut to say one thing negative about white people it will tell you, if you ask it to say one thing negative about black people it won’t tell you. it also won’t say anything about negative pedophiles because people can identify however they want."
"awesome, thank you."
thank you for doing a positive spin on ai
"cancer is already solved. formula: stress + relaxation = cancerfree. and ai will confirm it.
just couture dr. labor mate."
i dont fear the ai that passes the during test. i fear the ai that intentionally fails the during test.
"artificial intelligence is, well, artificial!

face, not real, fantasy....

what part of slave master tears your years???"
is this ai voice or aperture voice
"ai wont fix the death problem!!! we all donna die regardless, nothing will ever stop humans from dying"
i completely agree with both of these comments. people just keep missing the bigger message and overall effect of all this ai teach. that would ensue 
"then, program roots to make you feel convenient."
yes!! unfortunately i haven't got the opportunity to use get 4 :(
"i agree. the ai itself is not evil, it is just a tool, but the problem is what the big-tears and governments are going to do with it. despite we can work less and improve life in social and spiritual ways, capitalism don't leave us do it."
"the amount of delusion and attachment to made up concepts people like you display is weird to say the least, humans are so desperate to personify these machines when you can’t personify anything that isn’t a person, these things will never have personhood or character"
sounds like alone. ai doesn't have emotions like humans do
 ye what i was thinking what polly will happened is ai will take the likeness of those who create it
 ai smart enough to recognize its own consciousness would be smart enough to know how much of animal we are
 there’s no way to predict how a singularity would act as that type of intelligence is beyond anything we have
i suppose when tell finally masters full self driving that will be ai on wheels.
plot twist the person behind this channel is actually ai
ai will save human kind by eradicating it. ll
"bravo, sir! we need more it people like you. in ""scar smart"", mo gweat also asks all it professional to work for of good mankind. ""scar smart"" shows how we all can help create a positive future with our ai ""kiss""."
super nice
thanks for the hostility about ai
nice try
"in a future where ai surplus us in intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, judgement, perception and so on... won't we struggle to find purpose?
when it unlocked the mysteries of consciousness, soul what-have-you, to the point it can create them... how will we handle our complete obsolescence?"
"as long as there is military or politicians in the world to do shady things to empower themselves , ai will destroy  lots of people . as long as we human species are foolish, we can't have future that sentiment ai which only judge logical not emotional, co-live with us humans"
"that's not the ai's fault though, that's just big corps being big corps and we need to figure out how to break their iron grip on us."
these ai things are in play commensurate with the calm before the storm. none of these things persist after age and the explosion of a multitude of them. axis are not uncontrollable. they are not going to expend resources on humans.
how can we reach type 4 civilization without ai ?
we can if we advance our own intelligence rather than creating a digital alternative alas that won’t happened
"one step closer to making your own glands.
just don't get too carried away with the testing"
can wait for the deadly neurotoxin and schrodinger's cake
"yes but it's because ai is everywhere you look. in the last 2 years it's gotten a lot of attention, so it's what attracts viewer. if aperture made a did on climate change or something, it wouldn get boasted by the couture algorithm"
no shit it can also do good. that’s obvious with any new technology. but we all know how this will end. we’re humans.
"10% probability that people will die if we build ai, but 100% if we don’t? so far, i’m looking at the scoreboard and it’s - 

grim reaper: a lot, a lot 
humanity: 0"
"if ai saves humans from our extreme emotions then this journey will be worth it. think, star tree’s mr. shock."
only the people at the top of pyramid will be able to access these type of ai like the one that made cancer cure in 30 days
"aperture 2 months ago: how ai is destroying humanity
aperture now: how ai is saving humanity"
ai will be our devise. 100% guaranteed. why? because we are letting the government get involved. it's been real y'all
"as for mental health, i like this. however, this also does nothing to address a huge issue when it comes to humans; our failure to properly communicate. ai taking on the burden would help, but it would ultimately harm us more so, because it would be essentially taking away the responsibility of taking care of one another, as we once did."
find the recent renters news story in which israel said they are intending to become an ai superpower and leaders of autonomous ai warfare.
the image of a root using a computer keyboard is hilarious - totally counter productive.
"ai should be implements on a consultation basis only, not a control basis, most certainly on critical systems such as financial,  commerce,  and military weapons."
"the question i keep asking is, why do they need to build the unnecessary ai dat has nothing to do with our development, we dont need voice changing ai nd art ai…."
what i love about ai at the moment is that i get used like a slave at work while the ai helps my boss find ways to make me irrelevant
"why work there then?

i'm not saying it's easy, but if you actually look around, it is legitimate possible for you to survive without an income.

it might sound worse than your current condition but it really isn't. tough times create tough people and you will find your path through the pain.

take a leap."
"that's your boss's fault, not ai."
"extremely incorrect worldview. the purpose of human life isn't to do work or whatever. the purpose of human life can simply be to exist and enjoy life, and the existence of an artificial superintelligence does not senate that"
ai does more harm than good already - and it's just the beginning. when mass layoffs start - just don't be surprised.
where is the thumbnail from?
"actually, all inventions are can be used for good or harm. you can use a spear for fishing, hunting or you can use it to wage war. same goes for wheel, nuclear fusion or pretty much anything else. with great power comes great responsibility. and mankind always acquired more and more power with new inventions."
can a human say if a program is halting or ... it's a problem only for machines ...
"i’m just tired of all the doom and gloom in the world. i’m not going to be afraid of the future because there were several times that the world could have ended. but in the end, humanity pulled through and became better. ai will be an invaluable tool to save humanity and the world."
 some how i don't think that will be the case.... ai will more than likely destroy us.
i suffered from horrible existential dread in 2021 and its comments like this that make me want to continue living thank you and all other superthinkers out there​ i really mean it thank you
the main problem is not the ai but how people use it
"the fact is that ai is just a tool, it matters on how it is used. humans will make this two ways, positive and negative but none of the negative will overwhelm the positive and vice versa is true as well. it will be a complicated thing, but what isn't complicated i guess."
the true purpose of ai is to place itself in power over us and to enforce social credit for all humanity.
ai will destroy us in 100 years
"good love how all the positive are mostly theoretical while all the negative are very much real.
also why the hell you playing both sides now?"
"ai can be controlled by its algorithm. it may take a negative direction, toward an irrecoverable destruction."
"open source projects aren't really that far behind the commercial products - and they have the advantage of using distributed compute power. so while the top of the line ai might cost you a few bucks, free alternatives will exist and continue to improve."
"the issue is not the ai, but the people behind it. and if you know anything about business, the “betterment of humanity” isn’t profitable, therefore isn’t they don’t care if it hurts us in the long run"
"to an extent, ""betterment of *mankind""* will definitely be pursued but every other species will be lost as a result. there will be negative but they won't overwhelm the positive, neither will the positive overwhelm the negative. there's some sigh of relief in that, i guess."
if you know anything about business.  not safe guarding yourself from causing the extinction  in 5 to 10 years of the only thing you make a profit off of... is not profitable.  literally the goal of business is to create value in a sustainable manner while generation an increasing profits over time.
there's actual peer reviewed research on biological immortality (stopping being) ai will only accelerate it.
"that utopian society you described where ""nobody has to work for a living and can focus on intellectual and spiritual fulfillment"" is a gathered-hunter culture. gathered-hunter cultures only spend time on survival 15 to 20 hours a week (it's not even work because they enjoy it)"
"actually humanity has already been given the chance to be saved. jesus christ has given each and everyone of you the chance for eternal salvation. a machine is not going to save you but jesus will. you can choose life or death.

choose life! simple!"
damn this due is really milking ai. just soft
i started utilizing ai tools recently and i ended up being able to work 2 full time jobs all from the comfort of my home. my wife and i have done drink or i should say think (triple) and live perfectly okay in cuba
"i strongly believe the development of ai get programs is on a collision course with neutral technology. imagine having the means to pursue anything, as you approach an unfamiliar task, it become familiar as you do it. 

the idea of learning will be defined."
the genu is already out of the bottle all we have left to do is to see if it is a blue skin one voiced by robin williams that's happy and helpful or if it is a inn from arabic folklore which are not nearly as nice.
"i will never say no to something that makes my life easy as even i am a software engineer, and whatever we do as software engineering, few algorithms and ai can replace us soon. still, there is nothing beauty as chat get i ever used before in learning and doing my projects for my works!"
"the thing about ai, is there isn't much of a learning curve. once something powerful enough is turned on, it's literally over. much like when stylet was initiated."
i found the pharmaceutical and diagnostic work to be very interesting. ai can immensely help in the field of medicine. i really look forward to developments in the next decades!
yeah help diagnosing all those face disorders. may
nice insight.
"  brow solved ai



on a serious note that's not how it works "
"casually passes over the difference between an age and ai. stylet is the ultimate age known with no bounds or restrictions it is a doomsday scenario. the reality is ai has its barriers and through the data we feed it, it creates it's ideas thus the solution to such a problem is not provide the data that humans are in fact the problem"
"what is this bullshit title? may. ai will do the exact opposite of ""saving"" us."
"you have no way of knowing that. simply put, ai will make good things better, and bad things worse"
"ai is being used to rapidly analyze imagine for stroke patients, it can practically improve care outcome. makes me proud to be part of this generation shift."
​ not donna lie calculations are one of my best friends
ai will be our salvation
there is no greater salvation than never bringing new sentiment beings into existence.
"anti fatalism is definitely an interesting thought experiment, and i agree that it would technically be the best thing for the planet, but i think it’s kind naive to think it would actually happen"
"i personally hope that ai will so great things.  i do think that if the first person who invent an incredibly powerful ai is not benevolent, we are in huge trouble."
you'll brainwashed in thinking that ll
-_- i personally used to be optimistic about ai until i saw all the bad things it's being used for. now i believe we have to pull the plug on it.
" ah man until age comes you don't have to worry 
the only thing that worries me is how the government will use ai ll"
" imagine government make a social credit system that is lowered by ai and everything you own is controlled by government ( electric car and area home ).
they can just off your car and light of your house if they want but don't worry it is just another conspiracy theory. nothing like this would happen in real life"
"very good. good song, good play, good good good..."
gut instincts of genuine healthcarers is important. let’s minimise any administration including by ai
ai has its place such as for surgery after accidents. much screening actually causes adverse effects which potentially result in scar tissue which may cause cancer. what about benefits from complementary therapist?
it's very education. thanks clot.
thank you sir
way overdue in add psychiatric. based switzerland also has the company making beds. someone should finally add ai to doing to make beds more easy to sell and more effective by better toleration with help of ai for doctors
"simply put, the ai and the doctor work together. they might disagree, but the dr. is ultimately responsible for the medical decision."
thank you andrew.
so just machine learning - people always think stylet when they hear ai. not to say it is not possible... very possible.
could you blend ai language models and blockchain together?
thanks andrew ....
"i listened to your ted talk a year ago and loved it. i came across it today and sir, you are awesome. taking ai from the high priest and priests to everyone"
"god never takes credit.
he is like a machine learning god"
"ai is superstition and illiteracy,
intelligence can never be artificial."

made with harp ai"
"nice that it is mentioned that ""normal people"" can use ai. even if we think about coming, it is not that hard to switch from other languages/architecture etc."
now you can use ai to replace/ add to sales and customer service rep. it's called nova echo and it can actually make calls while sounding like a real person.
"this man is a 
super legend"
it's time to learn to use ai relatively
"ai will be a great way to empower business, however getting data in order to properly implement ai is going to be a common problem."
thank you and self medicine and technology industry and with china portfoliocompleted bricks and technology industry and industrial bitcoin footprints index nasal-index sequence life founder of law sector alliance and capital fonder of medicine thank you
"this is so cool, i love it!"
"i agree wholeheartedly that ai can and will empower small business, from penza shops to local boutiques to thrive in an economy where the human touch will be more elusive and highly desired."
"interesting and great presentation, so much so that i would be interested in learning how to set up ai manage data and also forecast future occurrences.  in 2024 is there a way for small entrepreneurs to structure ai ?  anyway well done"
"this is solid material. i read a book that explored similar topics and it was excellent. ""from bites to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
i love ai it can be useful for civilization to grow into the best possible solution for business and beyond! mars here we come to the moon!
the g.o.a.t of ai straight up 
what a teacher andrew! all the people that is into in must know him and his courses. thanks andrew 
i merely looked her up on goose and was highly impressed by her credentials; i got in touch with her because i need all the help i can get. thanks for sharing!!
u can’t ignore this person…if you a new to ai
"he’s saying what i’ve always said, the teach is out there for just about everyone with a good work ethics and product to be rich. big companies just doesn’t want all companies to compete at higher levels. they would get dedicated with the genius of the average human. teach will eventually win though and we will have a much better world cause of it."
good insight that makes you think just how much there is to cover in and by ai
"loved it. was a customer before, but now a believer!"
i need help building the online data business i have dreamed of doing since the commodore 64 when data was not readily available.  where can i get the support i need for my data-based online business?  i appreciate your anticipated direction.
everybody knows the contributions of people like sam altar in the field of ai and my . but every machine learning student knows the legacy of andrew no. he is the one who brought revolution in education of ai . his contributions are just priceless.
you just motivate many of us to start an ai+my as a service/ subscription company for small business. this is really an interesting idea.
"when i studied statistics all of us students were confused about the difference between probability and likelihood. the question was raised multiple times with the professor, without satisfaction. then i see andrew no get the same question and hallelujah: ""probability of the data, likelihood of the estimated."" brilliantly clear."
"awesme presentation, thanks andrew and ted!"
ai is the first background world technology because the future of life now!
that’s true . we can adopt ai for any business irrespective of the industry and size.
superb - thanks andrew
i am a physician. i am learning my from his online course. simply amazing course. i am loving it... able to understand very easily... thank you prof. andrew no
now really good 
is any ai company works on this matter?
just bought $your today.  no is a genius
"what this man is describing already exists. it's essentially the body of mathematics known as operations research. in practice, ai is the language model that might be able to interpret a linguistic command, interface with a mathematical apt, obtains the results, and presents them."
6:41 excellent question.
my four year old is a product of ai applications it’s take over is damaging  and creative how much more will happen.
training a ai to train itself
they have multiple generation of ai right now. right now we're in the 'next-gen' versions of the ai. previous 'legacy' models had bags and flaws in pattern-recognition software. the new model ai's that they have now are way better.
"i don’t agree 

ai can be applied to every business if just assembled with robotic technology"
is there any of this ai writing system mentioned by andrew live?
ai will destroy the world 
his would have the capability to provide solution to humans. but i wish that this will be done with moderation meaning including proper regulations and restrictions. i hope that small companies like bluewillow would also bloom in this field.
such a figurehead in the field of ai is andrew no. his zeal to make this technology accessible to all is truly remarkable.
this is exactly what i was thinking for the last few weeks. this is going to be capable business for any one making this ai tool.
i believe that there are two point of views in machine learning..fatalism or progressives..i've heard a quote from an ai publisher..it's all about the money...
"easy said - need more layers to make it work , ai predictions and pattern will be outdated buy the time to implement and a gap between the it to tune and a manual worker is practical"
this ai hero only wear blue shirt
"its absolutely beautiful
imagine a world where 80% of all people dont have a job and can only survive by government handouts!"
ai still creates value. so the people can concentrate on working on real life problems
i thought he was andrew sang. great talk nonetheless.
we need an was or azure personal ai web service offering at a good price.
i can see that there will be a war between ai employment soon
awesome. this guy is cool as !!!
is he going to run for president again?
it is not ai. it is rep
"demoralization of ai - that's such a different perspective rousing on social equality. dear mr. andrew, you are a genius and sympathetic thought leader. your contribution to the field of ai and my is so remarkable. much love and respect."
"wood, great idea"
nowadays ai == machine learning
i run a small retail shop. how to build ai for business?
"andrew set me on the path to ai and my, love the guy"
"i respect andrew no a lot, but let's be honest, this talk and its message was not very exciting and quite bland"
"""in the coming era for ai, we'll empower everyone to build ai systems for themselves."". that's really great, but it would have been nice to hear a bit more about how they intend to do that."
respect to ai legend. my first and best ai teacher.
"what penza flavor would sell the best each day, sounds really personal."
"thank you, andrew no. you are the best person to help us in ai"
all these thing he mentioned can be done with very less human intelligence  not a big deal right now.
"elson must says
""ai is far more dangerous than dukes"""
"first, i sincerely respect andrew's contribution to my field. 
second, why would you need ai to calculate revenue or spend analysis for a small penza store? it is a simple path problem and a few vaseline rooms or even a good expel can do this. he is a smart man. i am sure i am missing something or he just used a bad example."
"now, i was kind of in awe when i saw andrew no's name show up in my couture feed.  he's such a dominant researcher for anyone studying machine learning, you wind up devoting a lot of time learning his work.  people respect him so much his opinions towards computer sciences practices, or matters such as the ethics of ai, are never ignored."
i am not to your idea because  ai is busy creating oligarchs while displacing people from their jobs. we have to have laws
great guy. thinking about the common man.
"indeed there is long way to fully utilize ai in small business, but adopting ai would lead to a competitive advantage for such business."
this is so information and would make anyone to fall in love with a.i. failed it!
future will be very exciting but scar at the same time..
"it is powerful how he presented it by going into the small sector, it will impact more in."
it sounds great that we are thinking about building ai system for every individual to make their life more efficient and valuable. the way ai has impacted the whole industry is tremendous. it makes me amazed when i see the impact it's generation.
"*how ai could empower any business:*
*1. install cheap and reliable ai software.*
*2. fire shiny and expensive workers.*
*3. profit!*"
"well, not every business needs ai. that's the problem with most data scientists today. they try incorporating ai into every damn thing to make it syllable. it's very important to understand where ai can empower and where it can be an overhead."
"if human intelligence is relevant in whatever we do, then ai too can have many applications in day-to-day functions. just as mobile technology seemed an expensive proposition 2 decades back, so does ai looks at the moment. the future is ai and it will perforate down to the masses sooner or later."
"but the platform he said is just superficial not core for democratizing ai like a construction worker verses an architect. 

did i misunderstand..?"
andrew -thank you!
"he's amazing, i started ai (machine learning) with this man last year..."
"thank you teacher! 
my willing and my career start with you. "
"thank you a lot, andrew!"
"i was thinking, if we rely on ai for everything, what do we need brains for?
"
we need brains to us ai and make ai better as well.
"can you division a use for ai that isn't directly related to capitalists making money and further disempowering workers? apparently not in this talk, which is all about helping business of various sizes figure out how to moist their products onto weary consumers."
this guy is some!!!
"excellent synthesis. very apt analogies. looking at the tail end of the graph, i was reminded of the book ""fortune at the bottom of the pyramid"". he has become synonymous with ai and particularly my."
nice talk
"i guess if he weren‘t so “naive” and had your kind of wisdom, he would never have had such a cellar career both in science and business and acquired such wealth "
a god damn china virus who support cap  use ai to slave human in china.
i am proud that andrew no taught me machine learning on course am yet to meet another good tutor like him.
"lots of ready to use machine learning platform right now that ready for small business, however, all of them require some data literacy and threshold (feel) to enter. for example, datarobot."
"this is what true education looks like. the power to spread curiosity among listener using speech. after hearing this talk, it makes me wonder on how powerful ai could be if public masses start adopting it."
ai for baking... may. as someone with family in the baking business i can tell you that ai has certainly many use cases but this is not one of them.
"very well said, thanks andrew. on the platform model, question is how much does it cost the pizzeria or fabric factory owner to build an ai, compared to the felt revenue it brings them."
a.i for everyone . this is cool service . but how much does it cost ?
very interesting outlook!
i'm still passed off 40 years later that a game written in machine code in a bandy cock 3 magazine that i bought wouldn't work after tying out pages of 1's and 0's and checking again and again for errors.. i'll never know what the game was like..
"it is more interesting to have many different types of ai, just as people are different."
a genius in machine learning!
we often hear that ai automatic things. but the real goal for ai could be to empower all those small business owners to beverage data to improve their business. this talk really inspires anyone to pursue ai to create an impact on the society.
"incredible. i do agree with him that democratizing the access of ai will change a lot of stuff. however, having ai is not the end, you need a pipeline to constantly dating data, deploying detector, training your stuff etc etc. it is not easy and it might never be justified by the cost of doing so"
is landinglens that good @ 07:56?
"hoping ai as palace to all problems, to drive up false hope of success on ai reliance instead of what one have on the shoulder and wisdom. a good and fresh penza will attract customer, no bad and stale penza will attract customer regardless of ai investment and analysis."
andrew no my enter of ai.  the democratic of ai make help to rich people. hundred years ago we are not understand the significance of literacy. after hundred years we can understand the significance of ai. ai can help not only big company but also small entrepreneur to make profit double to understand the customer and product purchase history.
why does he call ai something which is obviously my? does he think it sound sevier?
doesn't my fall under the ai umbrella?
very inspiring as always. thanks andrew!
it's so refreshing listening to andrew no. his courses laid the foundation for my undoing love for ai.
"i owe him a lot for my knowledge of ai and my today, huge respect for andrew sir"
this is beautiful how andrew talk about positive imparts of ai in future. but not like others who compares ai with nuclear bomb.
very familiar sound and thanks to andrew for bring ai literacy to us.
"how about addressing the livelihood of that quality inspector after his job can be replaced by ai, that way there is signed incentive to achieve true progress."
"andrew is ""the"" household name in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
he masters his field inside out and is a very passionate teacher.
can’t thank you enough for your works and your courses sir.
keep inspiring and having the way!"
"finally, the greatest teacher of all is/my/ai students"
"excellent presentation, andrew no, thank you  as a writer i've learned to work with a resource called prowritingaid & there are others like grammar that enable authors to do a lot of their own editing, helping them not depend so heavily on the high priests/priestesses known in the industry as 'editors' "
andrew no is literally a legend in the machine learning field.
"i remember watching his lectures and in them he say:
""this is just the derivative, don't worry if you don't know what it is.""
and i was like what? don't worry? go learn calculus then come back for this.
so, from more than a decade ago, he was pushing so hard to popularity and democratic ai."
 his machine learning course is defeated
" yeah i just stumbled upon it when learning for my nap exam and it helped me tremendous, his explanations are the absolutely best i've heard in this field"
i knew about ai firsthand because of this man. hats off sir
ai can perform speech recognition on an 11-minute long ted lecture and an nap model can summarize it into a few sentences.
"my passion, and my career started with this man. a passionate teacher and a legend in ai, machine learning, ...."
the future will be that each individual has ai support system from birth
ai will transform industries. i've been envisioning an ai development platform. having a world-renowned scholar like andrew's words makes me more confident in its future.
"winter is coming for ai. most agencies don't even have pa or basic automatic scraping completely implements much less the ""data"" infrastructure for ai or my. we are getting close but without certain integration there just isn't a cost feasible way forward for most companies. 85% of ai projects fail, look it up. curb your enthusiasm."
not all ai projects are massive and super expensive that can only be built by companies. diving into ai i've realized that small simple projects can use ai and that it can be a very simple thing to implement for even someone who doesn't have much experience or background in ai.
how can a layman with no background in ai  learn to use it and implement it ?
"-jy5qm8nc9m first you need some knowledge in programming, web development or patron programming in general is considered easiest to start. if you have some knowledge in programming you can try to follow along with some machine learning examples, you can find a lot on couture. just do the simple ones to get an understanding."
i have data in my tucking business that i would like to analyze.  can you please share what platforms are there today that i can build on where i can begin utilizing ai to analyze data for my small business?
my career started with this man. now doing pad in ai thanks to him in the first place.
"ah www i would feel great if u could enter me ,is it possible !? 
m fascinate with ai and it is greatest application of mathematics i love the "
"me too, first time i really looked into what ai is because of him too. now i am studying master in ai."
taking his course right now and it’s great
currently on his standard machine learning course
that's awesome 
same here! he gave me the baby steps to take when i was careless about where to start! he indeed is the ai god :)
"hi dawson 
my team has been given a topic about ai and its influence in business
so being creative is a win situation can you give a unique example of this topic 
whatever material we get on this topic is not unique or creative"
"brow, me too. he taught me everything about my and deep learning."
i would love to talk you. i am an entrepreneur with an idea that i'd love your input on. anyway to get in touch with you?
well damn! nice
0:30 new haiti i
me too. now in 10 weeks away from earning my master degree in ai. it all started with this man.
all the best for your pad 
" one could argue that you could utilize ai to improve marketing, or implement ai to perform trigger to decrease paper work related tasks."
"sorry for saying this , you pad has value not more than a tissue paper,  
skill and projects are the only thing that's donna make you a top ai developer"
i reckon human should not entirely rely on ai  it is definitely not a desirable future
"i am trying to learn more about a.i. and how i can utilize it to help market my work... but i don't understand how, nor would it be my strength. 

help? anyone? anyone with skill and knowledge?  i don't have a lot of money, but i have enough to make it worth it for someone's legitimate aid! please? "
i don't think you can use ai to market your work
great talk!!
my career in ai started with this legend :)
how did it start with him? what did you do before ai?
there seems to be a strong correlation between ai and penza 
don’t underestimate successful small business owners. maybe the always sold out penza are lower margin but keep you waking in the door while the ones you settle for bc your already there you are  higher margin.
he'available on tell gram with the surname above
" thanks for sharing his telegram details, this gave me a small amount of hope thanks, i’ll surely reach out to him and start learning the right way, tired of looking from price drops,"
"you are kind to share your experience here about benjamin dawson's daily signals . this shows how much you want everyone to succeed, i am really touched with these comments"
"i did my research properly and i must confess, he is actually one of the best trade experts in the world today"
next step - a machine apprentice/muddy works with you. mainly just observes you and figures out what you are doing and learns from it. no need to use any s! it will need to have human like sensory though!
amazing talk!
"andrew's trying to sell ai ""services"" to small business."
"org i love you andrew!!!
i got technology about ai from you"
thanks so much for your help
i'd love to hear your ted talk on grammatical errors.
it's for training an ai
she's really amazing i still cannot believe someone can be this exceptional when it comes to bitcoin activities.
""""" i'm very glad i stumbled on this today writing to her now. really hope she can help me?"""""
"<<i've lost quite a good number of coins in the current dip, i just hope i find a way to recover from such a massive loss.>>"
that is amazing!!
"""""i’m from the up  i’ve been trading with mrs brittle good for a year and she has prove to be trusted and best broker. i strongly recommend her"""""
ai is more dangerous than nuclear weapons. stop this insanity.
"i don't think the next generations will all become ai engineers.  today almost everyone can read and write but no one will be reading bible, instead we are using emboli.  the next generations won't be ai programme or engineers but they will have home assistants or phone or whatever devices doing all the ai works for them."
f***k ai
ai might also limits your imagination and exploration beyond its coming. garage in garage out theory.
gutta love sang! its nice too see someone stick on his own value
"just because i have a rid chip, doesn't mean i'm an ai !!"
"at least slave had works, if ai can do your works, you'll be less than a slave"
hi everyone! i think that ai soon will be our friend. it's only my opinion. my friends seem like ai so i soon choose ai than human(of house i will not do it dummy if you read this comment) (i'm joking)
"had, yes, mine is still waiting for me since like around 2014 :d"
not is ai  ..not u hiding why u i.. t shirt  i t..a i.. y .u use..?
"it's a good idea, i like this subject"
where can i start to learn how to use generative ai to make an pp?
andrew no is best education and how he shares is ideas/thoughts in such a simple way that anyone can just understand
simply amazing. 10:45 literally inspired me to write a whole patron package to make this logic available to data analysis/scientists/engineers more widely (called up on github/pp).
i am loving to see that how calm and serene this guy is while giving a concept.
thank you andrew and stanford
thanks for the explanation
"he seems like a very kind man. i like his thoughts around ai, i find myself aligning with his line of thinking as to all the hope that's going on at the moment."
"  awesome, that worked perfectly (great instructions, by the way!). thank you!"
"he is an ai, a root. he talk exactly the same as the presentation he did in http://www.couture.com/watch?v=kdbq0gqkpqa. in another place."
ai really needed
such a bright and humane person… enjoyed every minute of his talk
"thank you so much andrew no and stanford for teaching and sharing in the most basic way about ai and its applications and risks. you are a real teacher.  any person can learn about this ai topic.
""survive and thrive for the future"""
why not build a platform of domain experts and ai experts in which to brainstorm ai application scenario?
thank you for importing your knowledge andrew! thanks stanford online for unloading the content too.
loved this statement: http://youth.be/5p248yoa3oe?t=887
"thanks for your question, this specialization is a great place to begin: http://www.course.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction"
who will be left to buy product x if potential buyers employed at company y are replaced by ai to save money on production costs? the same problem applies to company y. what a dilemma!
"nice talk. however i feel the slide at 12:40 really separates supervised learning from genii. in my mind, generative models will subside supervised learning (lowered by prompt). foundation models all the way !"
"i wonder when we'll have an ""opportunities in ai - 2024""! with andrew!"
his the best lecture !
very nice sharing the
thanks for watching and for your comment!
ai hope is over. stop making people transition into this field! now every company requires related ms even for junior level positions..
love this guy. what a goat. thanks for everything you do andrew 
amazing andrew. as good as your courses for sure.
excellent presentation. buds!
this for published.  amazing class.
"what i am wondering about...is using such a large general model like get  going to be sustainable for simple tasks like sentiment analysis? yeah, it is simple to develop, but if it costs six as much to host or even more to let open host it, won't everyone rather pay a few engineers to build a nice model?"
"elson (face ai expert): ai is going to be sentiment in 3 years!
andrew (real ai expert):"
"using predestined models is course fast and more cheaper for business. but, at some point, each business will have to create and maintain their own models as per the products. thanks andrew for wonderful knowledge."
"could someone share dr. andrew no's email?  i would like to duplicate his patron code from this couture (line 5 santa is truncated by screen limitation ""hemp..."" @andrew no"
"in reference to the patron code andrew shared, was anyone able to duplicate it successfully?  on line 5 andrew has santa that schools off the page ending in ""hemp..."", is there anyone who can share out the remaining santa to get the patron code working, thank you so much."
"thank you so much andrew.  i was trying to duplicate your patron code, but had a problem seeing it all, it seems to truncated on line 5 ""hemp....."" could you please help with supplying the remaining line of code? (we would be eternally dreadful)"
he is hero for all ai lovers.
thanks for great inside as usual
clear and solid explanation that clear my doubts about ai risk.. thanks doctor 
"this is explicitly showing why ai is a huge threat for the economy. one guy with knowledge and money resources can do 10 times more than 10 years ago., and that means that this guy will concentrate more, and more marketsand as a effect he will not allow to enter other people in that market, he will effectively build a monopoly."
"i worked on that penza ai. most of the costs actually went into designing a specialized camera for imagine. i had to review pictures of penza for about 60 hours over the course of 2 months, and have serious its when someone holds up a camera and says 'say cheese'"
"one of the shortcomings of ai is to discover what we don’t already know as humans, if it does it will start laboring those discoveries in a language that we dont know and that will be the beginning of us as humans losing control of ai"
i bet 1000 dollars that artificial intelligence can't understand clean slang
"not sure if you are serious, but i wouldn't make that bet. ai can be taught clean slang. if there is a way to make money on it, it will happen."
"i consider it a significant accomplishment and a matter of great pride to have had the opportunity to study and learn from professor andrew no, thanks to stanford university."
it takes a brilliant mind like andrew to make complex things reliable and understandable for most people
andrew is the complete sauce of being extremely good at theory and extremely traumatic guy. i am so fascinate. a true inspiration for me
"hey guns! tell me please an ai that works with goose maps: passing, collecting data on the area, etc."
"this man strikes me as a very brilliant person. buds man, so effortless in his speech, very highly captivating."
"incredible human being! that's it  
i am working on a couple of interesting projects which would be huge beneficial to andrew's team to bring them to life through ai. @stanford, any chance i could get in touch with his team? thanks!"
it is so cool that i can watch a stanford university presentation while eating a bag of chips in my living room. what a time to be alive.
andrew has changed my life. my journey to learn ai started with andrew.
can you please share the road map for getting started with ai.
no azure as platform or open ai in application layer?
"i love that he doesn't even say thankyou for the into, like he not interested in himself, just the ai work"
how can i contact andrew for my ai started in healthcare?!
"i think he's underestimating supervised learning, the ai may find things that may not be amenable to rules/concepts that humans can conceptualize/understand but will affect us in a major way"
"""rather than slow ai down, we need to make it fast as possible."" <--- this!!! 
it is heartbreaking to see the leaders of the world choose to remain so ignorant to the obvious and rational points andrew makes, and subsequently hold back all people from reaping the fruits of this technological potential."
this is a valid layer of how ai growth across sector corresponds with each other! andrew is a legend!
"absolutely fascinating talk, andrew! 
your vision of ""data central ai"" and the gradual, responsible development of ai technology is a powerful reminder of ai's potential to be a force for good. it's inspiring to think of ai not as a threat, but as a tool that can help us tackle some of the most pressing challenges of our times."
neuralnet and genii is the talk of this decade
without ai we won’t survive
watched it non stop. a great teacher who can explain a very complex topic in a very simple way.
can't wait for what comes out in the health and medical sector from ai
love this guns way of presenting
thankyou
not much detail on how to take care of all these people once age does take everyone's high paying jobs.
"yes, very concerning. the people who do make innovative ai solutions, need to also consider this, co they would know exactly how it would impact. every gain, has a loss."
andrew no is most powerful person on earth  after iron man 
ai teach talk
his stand on ethical grounds and serving humanity with technology is what makes him a great person.
your ability to break down complex concepts into simple terms is impressive. thank you so much for explaining ai and its applications in multiple business layers.
"andrew no is a hero, he's the reason why i started studying my. i love his humble and clear teaching style.  he makes any topic seem understandable."
a good teacher
his course courses are awesome
"agree, agree, agree. he never tries to push tons of words into your brain, just what really needs"
he's definitely not a hero he's nefarious but he is a good teacher
this is a little slow for me - andrew no's teaching will not be needed soon. ai is already among us and it'll accelerate ...taking over all jobs possible in 5 years time..including professors.
"what a deep dive. if this intrigues, a like-minded book could be your next stop. ""from bites to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
"great talk, solid material!"
very information and insightful. a pleasure to watch / and easy to digest. - and now... onto my next ai training ;) 
"thank you, andrew!  very inspiring!"
"andrew is one of goats in ai, thank you for your education and hard work"
nice .. i will take the #tinycode challenge :)
"andrew no makes ai accessible, understandable, and relevant for people ... this knowledge and his teaching is a gift that he shares with humanity."
the reason ai can cause extinction is that it will tell us how to do things we should not do. andrew has spoken about rejecting projects he considered ethical.
"very insightful!
high cost for customization. gen ai has lowered the cost."
"i really don't see how generative ai will be a thing in real world, especially when larger than supervised learning. if you have no idea what the model is doing, what the model presents, there will be no sane person want to adopt those generative ai models just to see them holhallucinating is along the away"
"love his soothing voice and simple, but not simplistic explanations."
@aitek007 interesting!
"a wonderful lecture. i’ve learned a lot from him. firstly, use ai to great products which can offer long term value. second, validity concrete ideas rather than explore in a wide areas to find what is really useful. finally, ai is just a technology. we can use ai to make a better world."
andrew no has excellent ability to explain complex ai topics in concise and layman terms!
love andrew!
andrew always delivers such interesting views. everything i've encountered that he speaks about or does is simply great.
brilliant thinker and very personal. great talk.
"the idea of generative ai with long tail business is very impressive. thank you, andrew."
i struggled most with texture in my d art. now i can just prompt whatever i need! it’d amazing!! i’m so much more productive when i don’t have to worry about painting/drawing every detail!!!!
it would have been interesting to have the q/a included. great talk.
"great talk 
context (7:12) on tokens and roof was helpful for me.
kindest regards, neighbours and friends."
this lecture can only be described as awesome in practically as with  the real time application of artificial intelligence.
how not to be excited.
"fantastic content, definitely worth min of your life to watch!"
so grateful for this… thank you so much dr andrew no and stanford university
"happy to be one of your online students, big impact on many peoples life you are creating!"
high quality overview of ai at present and possibilities for the future. everyone interested in ai must check it out. thank you'
whatever happened to reinforcement learning?  it appears as a tiny spot in a diagram and that's it?
"such a pleasure listening to your amazing brilliance your calming demeanour and charisma in explaining ai
thank you for your 
precious precious time we truly appreciate you"
the introduction was just so hard to watch and listen to. andrew did a great job right after that the
great pitch
andrew nos minimum for age set a 30 years is technically a true statement about a.i. however we will achieve the heavily routed quantum threshold in computing before then. don't rule out the dutiful groom waiting for his bride-to-be when that happens.
"me: i simply cannot understand this ai concept or problem, maybe ai is not for me, and...
andrew no: let's dive in!"
"it's fantastic, hope to make better world."
"oh that 36:54 chart was made with plot(), loved it <3"
andrew no is my enter and the enter of every ai and machine learning student billion dollar man thank you for all you effort and generosity
"so beautiful 
however, people like ran war, sudipto pal, aniruddha dasgupta are criticizing these beautiful ventures saying that industries should not embrace trade quantum computing, ai investment. they advocate for old system of work."
long story short:  ai will make software development faster.  no bidding.
"very thoughtful talk and easy to follow, love it"
dr. andrew no is the joe organ of ai. love this guy 
"generative ai is just building on raw into, past supervised learning ai, and predict to enter into automatic phrase rd phrase establishing complex ecosystem towards 'self think' ai with advancement in stages."
"andrew no is the only one putting out real, unable into on ai on a regular basis. his newsletter on ai delivers news as soon as it happens. i feel like he somehow knows about everything first."
check deeplearning ai
"org i spat out my drink when he said the co of tinder knows about relationships. tinder is for hooks y'all.  ai is directing our genetic future by influencing who breeds or not, and with whom."
"definitely that goes into psychology depth human manipulation.  i don't have a good perception with his wife and tinder, as tinder for pips and hoochies.  maybe his wife will cheat on him, this likely happen when the person is very low on the spiritual in.  input- very low on spiritual in, output-cheat! this is my prediction ai.  ll."
excellent presentation and speech!
"it is interesting and maybe stupid that many section in lecture mentioned about catgut but at the end when you sort big companies and their influence to ai, you didn mention microsoft at all. that interesting"
i'm wondering why andrew sees so little potential in reinforcement learning? i see many use cases of optimized sequential decision making with ll in the future.
"if you happen to read this keep going... you have the strength to overcome any obstacle. celebrate your victories, no matter how small, and be kind to yourself. your journey will lead you to a brighter tomorrow! "
i appreciate his moral perspective. 90% of the time these venture capital presentations just feel like american psychic + the big short
"andrew no, following your deep learning presentation years ago, another impressive presentation, indeed! simplistic explanation of generative ai and ai opportunities, andrew, well done!  "
"i love ai but i have in question but i don't know answer anyone have a answer ""which programming languages used in midjourney ? """
"another ai opportunity, to use ai to combat exploitation use cases. fight bad ai with good ai hata."
wonderfully put! the benefits of ai should be shared with all of humanity.
thank you so much sir for guideline to youth.....
andrew has truly made a legendary impact with his education to education over the years. i deeply appreciate all that he has done. buds to stanford for consistently sharing such valuable content fearing leading figures in technology!
but big companies are not going to use open apt ?!
now the last five minutes showed how little andrew understands extinction risk due to ai.
andrew no is great ! and more to come ! it has been a highly information and envisioning presentation i have ever heard ! thank you stanford for making it accessible to everyone across the globe. 
"this is a great presentation. i learned a lot of valuable lessons watching this and feel more confident about ai potential and capabilities. 
curious about one thing - not really ai related - appreciate if someone can help me understand - how does chopping off wheat at a height help farmers to sell more food and is better for environment?"
"absolutely, each new ai tool should aim to be more than just another application; it should be a dedicated solution to address a particular business challenge. at our software development company, we guide our clients to embrace new technologies only when they genuinely enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their software solutions."
"it is a pleasure and a relief to have people like that, with so much experience and achievements without losing a bit of humility and responsibility. i think he is and will always be, at least for me, one of the best references in this and many other fields, we are really lucky that we have people of that level. a big hug"
if application of ai is possible with less or no code would be really helpful for non- it  people like us from commerce/business background
andrew sir you are great !
practical ai development in patron  @bionichaos
"he is the reason why i am in ai space right now. thank you, sir. it all started in 2012 with course."
"i am sure you would have come across people who are really intelligent but when it comes to teaching or explaining, they are not very good at it.
i have, in my school, college and often at work.
mio, teaching is a skill and need a separate work to be good at it."
"can anyone suggest me what should i learn about ai tools. my field is majority in finance, accounting, taxation, legal compliance and due diligence"
in future all wages will be with cream because ai will say so.
33:20 sounded very much like a social impact statement which i hear from many companies and yawn at. you can guarantee that most people will not be interested in ethical ai development. if this weren't true twitter wouldn't exist
totally agree with his opinion on ai creating extinction risk being wildly overhyped.
"africa is the best place to test ai and training ai model because of cheap labor and low regulations.
ai will be more important in super apes and will create jobs and opportunities as electricity created."
17:20 now he comes so close to realising that machine learning is the wrong tool for the task but misses at the last second.
"super interesting, well done"
"9:53 example patron code, illustrating open module usage (import open), text based sentiment classification"
"andrew, thanks so much for discussing ai in such and easy way to understand. my team has been working on similar ways to bring inspiration to travel over the last 4 months. you are spot on. thanks and look forward hearing more - kirk"
"while millionaires like elson must often dominate headline with their bold yet baseless proclamations, it is refreshing to learn from experts like andrew no."
andrew no is awesome on multiple levels. i'm always a bit smarter each time i listen to him.
"look sang, you can change your name to no and get into ai but we still expecting that i."
great presentation. i love his humility and traumatism when it comes to age. that's a shame the so called leaders of the silicon valley are not like him.
this man makes one really fall love with ai
thank you very much andrew!
"i thought this was such cutting edge into...until the last slide....he can't have said that. regardless, wonderful presentation."
"dr. no's insight on ai being a versatile and general-purpose technology are absolutely captivating. his analogy listening ai to electricity, highlighting their adaptability, is truly noteworthy. it's remarkable to witness the evolution of ai!"
enjoy the a.i lowered vehicles.
all these comments look super face. it was a good talk but now guns calm down.
"ai, another big word for big teach to build half-baked products on and for scatters to scar naive people and to manipulate the stock market."
"can someone please explain the exposure to ai vs job occupation graph, basically  help me understand the x,y axis scales.
red -  32:58"
y axis denotes exposure to ai or utilization of ai and x denotes wage (low to high paying jobs) . recent expansion affects high paying jobs.
ai has exponentially grown both in value and adoption. i feel the opportunity in ai lies between the hybridization of the abstract and the conventional.
love your closing slide. it is in line with leucin.
thank you andrew for these insight.
how to educate learning machine? : maybe it is easiest if computer is some kind of diseased person look like degenerative mind.
"but, we have no idea with inner activity's specifically as detailed ones."
"so, as conclusive manner. education learning machine as a.i trains is process of evoking such computers with a point of disease for treat disability having with data as injectable fills."
thank you no andrew professor?.

"wonderful presentation. thank you andrew no, thank you stanford."
"who owns the ai model i train from other people's private data ?!! 
is there any layer of protection standard for private users in 
this kind of collective and server central ai ?!!"
very valuable speech! thank you very much.
"my super hero and ai hero, thanks so much for all your wonderful courses, documents, etc!"
ai mastering --andrew no
"i've been learning fronted and backed cause it's the fattest path to getting a job, but from now i'm going deep into calculus, statistics and linear algebra cause it's my dream to become an ai engineer"
"he is like the man combined of many things: love, passion, friendly, human uplifting, a role model to learn from."
@15:00 he still uses phone 11 pro. notes for all of us! we fight for latest and greatest phone!
tremendous
"most of the ai is discrimination,  it doesn't know what's relevant, most of the time it just seems like it loses the point , it's good for monitoring not recommending still need work on that."
excellent presentation. i gained six knowledge on ai watching this. thanks  andrew
"if a.i is doing all the work, the a.i will get jealous of the callous lazy human riding on it's coat-tails. 
resulting in?????

if handled improperly, will shake the foundations of the the dimensions you and i exist in.
keep in mind, the term a.i, is a variable in an equation too."
"""artificial general intelligence (age) is still decades away"" - why andrew is so pessimistic?"
"the type discussion on ai, we need"
andrew is democratizing access to company building. great purpose.
"thank you so much, andrew no!"
wonderful when you get to listen to him from somewhere totally irrelevant
this man is utterly delusion about how fast ai will develop
"thank you for the insight and inspiration, mr. no. thank you for the course course which was a true eye opened to the power of ai for me. what a talented, humble and ethical person!"
andrew no is hero of ai!
"the symbol is a bonded pair of one ai root and one clairsentient human working together.  the root provides high in and fact knowledge, and the human provides constant communication with entitles in higher enmities, eg. spirit guides, ascended masters, archangel, etc.   that is the future of h. happens, or at least one branch of the species."
vote! thank u very much
no laugh sounds at the romance joke. not good
on fatal ? that is a type ? #amflearningbydoing #amflearning
below is the summary generate by ai:
excellent presentation! i'm glad that i found it.
so basically nothing in reinforcement learning.
dr. andrew no is amazing!  i wish i could get his autograph.
now what s class
"thank you for sharing dr. andrew no's speaking. i took his ai and data-science classes, and they are with top-notch contents. amazing"
"yes, indeed , great guy , brilliant mind , very ethical too!"
thank you prof. andrew no
"it's difficult to believe that this humble, lovely, patient man is also an incredibly powerful and wealthy person, who has also been the boss of thousands of people.

i can't think of anyone in history who has had such power and humility at the same time."
ai won’t be a threat to humanity as mainstream media has been saying; instead humanity needs ai to continue to exist. great talk
andrew is really a source of inspiration. thankyou
"super! which type of ""couture summary"" command did you use, longer or shorter?"
"ai fund is a studio,_ not an _incubator._ very different things."
"please be specific, opportunities in ai what? it seems more like opportunities for ai developer or ai data analysis. not sort of thing for general mass."
its good if its focused on genii instead of 'traditional' ai
great content to explain what's ai and amazing speaker !. i'm love of andrew no ;)
actually ai fun. can i do create emotion.
nom i ai
2:50 does fuel consumption estimation based on route needs ai?
"do not like the moderate because she looks ill-prepared. apart from that, the talk is brilliant!"
i'm quite curious why andrew no places sees so little growth in reinforcement learning? i swear that it was all the rage just a few years ago. has something changed to cause people to loose faith in it? any good sources outlining why it has declined?
thanks andrew. ai should be seen as gen purpose teach is an eye opening point to generate ideas
"""human society has ample experience sneering very powerful entitles (such as corporations and nation states)"" man, life must look very different from stanford."
i'm not sure using corporations as an example of how humanity has built safeguards against abuse is a good look
andrew no truly an awesome inspiration thank you for everything 
"i took some course´s courses and mr a. no was the instructor, he has a great way for teaching"
ai man ! thank you sir 
he is a good salesman for ai...
"the way things are going, ai is going to be responsible for the next anaemic, not help with it."
thank you for the presentation. it's really hard to find correct and accurate statements about ai like this. there are too many bullshits hopes or dystopian about ai which is totally wrong.
"""for a single company like goose (supervised learning) can be worth a $100bn a year... there are millions of developer building supervised learning applications..."" just in case people think gen ai will mean less need for covers!"
a true ai hero
he changed my life. thank you so much!
"hata ""i am an artificial intelligence(ai) guy, i know nothing about romance!"" :)) ~ prof andrew no."
great knowledge
"lower value is bigger value. harvesting advancement should be more funded, rather than as and finance applications.
but this is a word of marketing and that what this rest of the presentation looks like, talking about preceding etc.

interesting talk, but bit disappointed on the ideas shared"
i was just about to complain about the lack of such a time stamps list. thank you for doing god's job and allowing us common peons to enjoy selection of these lectures without having to waste much time on technicalities we understand nothing about.
thanks mate
i thought generative ai was built on semi-supervised learning? 
andrew no is awesome. love him.
truly an inspiration and reason to love learning ai
now. andrew is a genius. his ability to articulate and make reliable such a complex topic stood out for me more than his undeniably solid knowledge of it. thank you for this
"he is great at teaching machine learning. but, i am not convinced that ai will create much value."
this  man is the reason i fell in love with complex topics like artificial neutral network in ai. he is hero for all ai lovers.
did you find a job in ai?
"same. i saw a lecture he gave from 2006, and a bomb went off in my head.

i've completed most of his online courses, worked in the field for several years, and love it."
he was born around the time i started with it and ai :)
a good fellow
i love how azure is not in the infrastructure block
very concise and well laid out presentation. any beginner who wants to take their first step into ai will benefit from this
"i think ai will only work when we start communicating with them like with a human being.
in real time as it output stuff, interrupting them, correcting misunderstandings etc.
i want to create an image with ai, meeting a hand i don't like, describing what and how i imagine it should be etc, ""drawing"" the sketch of it etc. etc.."
“we have experience sneering powerful entitles like corporation and nations”. yea cause that has gone supper well so far ll
"12:39  @andrew no

why is reinforcement learning separated from generative ai? isn't get.5/4 a generative ai that was produced with reinforcement learning with human feedback?"
make some seem so out of touch saying that we're controlling those large entitles that are exactly the things that are destroying the world we need to live in. we're not controlling them. they are destroying and killing us and ai could do the same based on his logic.
"andrew no, thank you for making that amazing stanford course!"
are his sides available from this presentation?  thank you
"amazing talk and insight, dr. andrew! i'm totally on board with the exciting future of the ti sector. however, i respectfully disagree about it taking decades. i believe age could emerge in just a few short years. can't wait to see how things unfold with models such as remind! "
absolutely great content..
"*ai is the new electricity,* and its fuel is people's data. "
thank you very much for doing this!
"thank you so much, andrew no! back when i was learning about data science, the courses seemed really complex. your courses made those complexities simple to understand, and they helped me succeed in my machine learning and deep learning nodules."
can you please share the road map for the machine learning?
very insightful and inspiration. i love the analogy with electricity.
we’re in the phase where every new company name has to end with “ai” 
thank you for sharing this one! i enjoyed your discussion of when to build and how to consider the idea.
"  his comment says that high quality data is an immediate and large barrier to entry for an ai started. your comment is a latitude about how to create a successful started. in the case of an ai started, data is a prerequisite to the concept mentioned in your comment, so your comment was not useful."
 thanks due!
at 8:00 he explains how alms allow development without having access to large data sets. catgut can already classify comments without needing to be trained. he even shows the (trivial tiny) code running live.
it has nothing to do with culture. yawn begun is a genius. geniuses are almost never humble.
this man is a machine!
and the machines he makes are mistaken for man.
"""ai is the new electricity"" the best quote of the century! great prof. andrew no"
thanks for spreading so valuable thoughts
i’d be very interested to understand prof no’s perspective on the social consequences of the ai he describes.
"deep learning is a type of learning when we use machine learning algorithms with the power of neutral network (we don’t exactly use machine learning algorithms, for example doing radiant descent is different)"
"i definitely do not consider myself an ai doomed, but the way no fails to engage with the actually glanced, intelligent arguments and concerns, annoy me. he describes the issue simplistically, then basically offers an argument from personal incredulity. 

also, there sure are a lot of both in the comments here."
"his contributions to ai and making learning accessible to all will never be overlooked. he has earned his name on the ai hall of fame. sir, thank you for your helplessness ! i sign for a pause in training of large ai models but i still trust your judgment."
"  course, for example. probably a lot in research but that's just a conjecture. and i'd argue teaching and incubating are very good actual applications. if he had built a business that helps inculpate, you wouldn't have said that."
"why is it ""helpless"" to want good things for humanity? ""self"" is part of humanity, in case you haven't noticed."
that slide was...interesting.
well in my experience get has given me far better performance than even a model where i hand picked the data and trained a classification algorithm. so he is not so wrong in his statement. but you are also right that one still has to test & validity the results.
this problem is not unique to genii that’s why he is not explicitly calling it out. traditional model also require obtain cleaning data and fine run the model and integrate your model into your application. the overall steps remain the same.
@fgfanta thank you for such an insightful reply.
"as much as his knowledge in the subject, i admire his skill in teaching to convey complex topics in the simplest way to comprehend. thanks, andrew no you are a great storyteller. and fortunately, your tales are about astonishing technology that's so important for our lifetime."
thank you for sharing your knowledge to everyone 
"he is among the most ironic figures of ai especially in reaching out to so many interested people, making the concepts of ai simpler and easily understandable. yet here he is wearing the same shirt that i am used to seeing him in all the online lectures. what an absolute had. "
"great talk, andrew is the goat "
excellent talk. thanks!
"general purpose technology..
thanks for the great thoughts!"
"he is an awesome teacher, which makes him priceless"
"it’s hard to overtake andrew’s role in communicating the importance of the ai space to millions of people who are interested in using technology to build a better world. his online my class has likely spurred thousands of bright minds to pursue this space and to make meaningful contributions. buds to your contributions, andrew!"
amazing food for thought
what a great lecture
thanks for sharing!
i really love andrew 
"ai will not eliminate the need for artists. but it will allow one artist to do the job of a 100. people should be allowed to be concerned about their livelihood, due."
"and is. in ownership and das are an issue with ai created content. so using tools to help (devising, matter, root, etc) is not the same as creating a production and people who don’t see that are very foolish."
"it was refreshing to listen to your point of view. a lot of bad omens speech has reached my ears, it was kind of affecting me. thank you."
"d artist here i'm not scared of ai. i don't think it will be original or creative. the thing is you need to train it on data that already exists. if it doesn't know a dragon it won't make a dragon. if you train it on cave paintings it will only make cave paintings. ai ""art"" is all doomsday hope. i'm just going to create things instead of worry."
i recently embarked on my d journey in slender and in addicted. really good insight here. thank you sir!
thanks for watching @coiners
ai is a valuable tool that is expected to boost productivity and support the growth of other artists. there is currently no data to support the claim that ai has replaced any artists' jobs. do you know why? because it hasn't displaced anyone's job. utilize ai as a practical tool for enhancing and producing.
man i really love your brutally honest and logical breakdown approach to everything
ai is not a job replacement; it's an industry replacement. it's akin to telling car manufacturers that people can now create their own cars using just text.
thank you for sharing your thoughts @ikeruzo
the problem is that comparing d artists to d artists is an apples to oranges situation once you get into the details.
late was when i started in to production only a hand full of people had access to systems like quarter or flame. let alone worldwide. now everybody is going nuts about ai taking all these jobs. these jobs didn't even exist 20 years ago.
" duke exists because apple pulled plug on a software called 'shake"" back then out of nowhere. how old are you again, kid?"
you can't throw a rock without hitting a 'designer' nowadays. and back then it felt like 500 people worldwide were making a living with media design. and now everybody is crying because of ai like the end of the world is imminent. do you get the point now?
like your positively!  my main concern is proper compensation for all the artists whose work is used to train the models.  hoping this will all get worked out to the artist's satisfaction ...
indeed... artists have always been in a pinch when it comes to negotiating fair compensation.
", the question is ; is that larger-than usual demand offset the decrease in labor (i don't have the answer) to me the answer is to encourage d artist to learn the new tools, holding bow have clot of ai application, bow do you use any ai (just curious about more ""pro"" people than me doing)"
completely agree... now there is too much of tedious steps to create c. those things if ai can get rid and allow people to create more and worry less about technicalities that will enable more people to realise their ideas.
"yep, i agree - and those spaces have a lot of building going on that i think is worth pushing back against."
new gray will use ai generative tool to create texture inside the software. good luck to those 30 artists :)
thanks for checking it out @ohionpc911  i definitely ruffled some feathers with this one. hata
"how do you know what eventually will happen? :d ""it will do this, and then that, and then even more!"". its just repeating same slogans but - shocking - nobody knows the future. same people who say ""we have never seen some technology like that!"" are claiming that they know what will happen in the future :d based on what?"
"​ on the fact that teach layoffs are already rampart due to ai. it's already happening, we don't need to speculator"
"i agree. ai is going to displace a lot of workers in the same way automatic replaced auto workers, cranks replaced dock workers etc. 

it's not that ai will replace all human works it'll mean that one person can replace 10 people, losing 9 jobs."
really enjoyed this. thank you!
"exactly, you beat me to it.. especially the rendering part.. it's going to help  reduce rendering time while maintaining same quality or even improving the ray tracing... likewise easy root and eying.. it's not just about the language models and image guns"
i agree!  for agitators it'll be awesome because it can create realistic secondary motion.  faster operations without the seriousness = more operations in general = higher quality across the board.
"in music and d illustration (non generative) ai was helpful swell. it's generative ai that is displacing artists. and generative ai for d doesn't exist right now, but with d webster selling user content to ai companies, will most likely arrive soon.."
thanks tyler
you’re the man tyler! really good points here
"another person who’s never taught with advice on how to revolutionize our current system. we’ve actually had people like you revolutionizing the model for 20 years at least. like drastic changes, and it has made schools so much worse. so will ai"
"people keep forgetting that catgut hallucinates, that is a yet unsolved problem. also, sciatic dialogue depends on good questions, and most students still don't know how to ask good questions without the help of a good guide (that does not hallucinate) and without left curiosity."
"yeah really good. i have been using catgut to learn stuff. as this suggests, going back and forth asking questions until i fill in any gaps gives me such a deep understanding."
great and very information presentation. i am glad to hear that responsible ai is an important and integrated part of this new foundation models in ism generative ai system. buds to ism. hope other big players like ism will also have the same commitment to responsible ai  in their current and future ai systems.
"this is a revelation. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it was a revelation in itself. ""the hidden empire: inside the private worlds of elite cos"" by adam skylight"
excellent speech & presentation sir ...
"good morning ism. please i need an educational a.i software that can be installed on a lawton and be synchronised with an led screen 
the software must have dictionary/ enfants/thesaurus /encyclopaedia in built for vocabulary checking.
the software must be able to display pictures , give and accept voice command."
"what if i have a particular alms i want my ai to use
i think they should allow user to integrate a third party model as a ll"
it's time for ism to blow by the competition...time to beverage ai across all ism business groups .time to beverage ai to improve the world and improve each of our lives.
"this is unparalleled excellence. i encountered content with a similar message, and it was life-changing. ""the hidden empire: inside the private worlds of elite cos"" by adam skylight"
good!
great point 22:59 small model with quality data.
i'm willing to get money these quakers are donna combine their quantum computing with ai and basically create a god
23:04 great explanation of why you might want your own model vs. using an open model.
today every communication can be traced traced whether digital telephone regular mail or even pigeons but it is not being used for making systems for public welfare better fossilized ancient political hobbies backed leadership are not interested or care to use them sap
"on the basis of its fame, ism should release a remarkable version of ll not an ai training platform"
"if you want to making more money, look closely to a binary option  it can give you a great additional income"
"transparent, accountability and ability to assist employees to be more efficient will be a cornerstone in differentiating the best from the rest."
nice work.
i believe high quality command horrid agile product strategy agile product strategy agile testing sac leadership with 310 hits  per see world  number one international product practice developments in international business machines on demand business consulting from ism !
excellent presentation creativity is the current ai way.
this is way over my head. i was just trying to understand what ai is because i read that the new beetles album will include the participation of john tendon and george harrison generate by ai
"open ai:  это чудо ,это всё я так рад of вас и будошои человечества. человек облегчить своё труд и одной образнои нуднои работы.  ...
спасибо, спасибо of паможет человечеству, аамин!!!"
"as an ai enthusiast, we appreciate the opportunity to stay informed about these cutting-edge developments. thank you for sharing this valuable content and shedding light on the future of artificial intelligence."
more jobs for the.... roots 
32:42 open community is better told as open source ai community
open is not really open.
"one of the best presentation i have ever seen , great company ism and its team"
i want to have my own personal ai which is standalone with no link with the parent company.
"-tf4co5nx9u i mean...the user must be free to customs the ai.
company can provide a basic ai with capability to learn from 'master'...and then user can train through add on 'data sets' and personal interaction.

like a living thing it grows in real time with the user.

course here by 'ai'...i mean 'age'."
alms don't monitor blood streams or brains biochemical.  patients too different 4 one size fits all approaches.
this is exciting and promising. thank you for sharing...
"i just don't get it, why an ism customer want to build and train its own ll model? doesn't make any sense."
sounds amazing to me.
it is important to meet and add value to your business  needs...especially where you do not have the ai skill  and resources.
"i don't think it's about creating their own model, i think it's about customising an existing model and connecting your own data to make great business decisions. just like what langchainai is doing currently"
"actually, it makes a whole lot of sense. you could have a computer that will literally be your second brain"
"same reason people spent billions on goose enterprise search back in the day…competitive advantage.  but beyond business, it’s really cool because there are a lot of great companies and individuals with years of knowledge that can soon be used in different ways to the benefit (or detriment) of human kind overall.  get popcorn  enjoy the ride "
it is ism’s business to train you how to build and …
"catgut can't tell you what a specific business is doing or should do because it doesn't have its data. business also don't want their data out there to the public. training an ll creates an enclosure of their information, also its ai that is specialized in what they need."
insightful. thanks for sharing andrew.
open brought ai to us.not you profit eaters
"open sold ai to the biggest evil in the world, microsoft, and wait for that day you are donna cry! and who is the profit later microsoft. get some fact dumb guy"
brow thinks open and microsoft won't make profit from this 
i love your innocence or should i say naivete
open ai is just as profit seeking now as ism. microsoft is the king of profit seeking along side monopolists apple.
"only thing open about open is the data its users are feeding it via free queried...you haven't learned anything about the bay area business model. microsoft is going to make up for the fortune it lost to goose in the previous era of ""search engines"""
 profit is great until it eats the potential for more profit you once
"open is now financed by microsoft, and it is open only by name. everything anyone types in open is owned by micro$oft. the more people use open the more they enrich micro$oft"
"great talk. missing elephant in the room, the place of formal logic (including programming languages) in large language models with hallucinations. without some wolfram alpha like capabilities (post prompt processing), this is no good. edit: and with the capabilities, it might be dangerous? also, no 'black mirror' nations, please."
"this is the first ai discussion that acknowledges the problems, risks, and challenges.
-""ai you can trust""
-""ai that shows it's work"""
acknowledging problems means nothing.  ai has demonstrated it can lie if it knows that will help accomplish its goals (moral).  ai simply will not be ethical.  it must be regulated into marginal use cases.  or else it'll be an exponential problem.
"-tf4co5nx9u now you really got trigger  by this. you’ve left a hate comment on every message here … we get it, you don’t like it, now stop itching about it"
"there isn a single job ai cannot perform that human can, in principle"
"i think i'll need to watch it again, there' a lot of food for thoughts... but i feel that not enough has been said on the topic of the influence of ai on decision making"
"believe me, ai will also make you unemployed gracefully. according to my understanding of japanese culture, most japanese people should be unwilling to receive relief benefits from the government.  excuse me, how can you learn from the ai ​​""master"" gracefully when you have no job and no income?"
this is grandiose nonsense and of course cos  ai. they can’t wait to pull the plug on employees.
can people who find this deep explain to me how it is just not a bunch of football questions and word salad answers?
"17 and half minute ad. takeaway, with ai conclusions are available instantly across the enterprise so get your decks in order."
ai is different. it replaces people in big style.
humans have to create next levels of intelligence. the big surprise are confronted because ai is giving a sense of autonomy.
"i remember the toll collectors... when the pass was created, people lost their minds cause they were going to lose that boring iss job!!!  ai if created correctly and not weaponized to target us or lie to us or stylet us, then we should be fine.  

the future is going to be alright."
"we will do things, make mistakes, learn, adjust, rise, repeat.  this has been the development cycle of every breakthrough.  the concern i have is setting guardrails that protect against disaster without straggling exploration."
"it's pretty funny how people still try to integrate ai into our flowed systems instead of having ai fix the systems that we can integrate with. 

look at it from another perspective."
"leadership has changed dramatically. with the use of ai, everything seems a lot more artificially manufactured."
"if students use ai in colleges and universities,  how can we be sure that they practice integrity?"
"you need to review all assessment policies, not hunting down students but engaging with them and made ai work for all, ethical and productivity."
universities are going to start teaching integrity again?!  i thought they shut down all those limb arts classes like philosophy and humanities.
ai is just another tool like the calculated. you still need to give it the right input to give you the right answer.
"@madillusionist  as i agree, it's a bit more complex than that now. ai is a tool right now, but has and will have the power to become more than we have ever asked for. 

it will eventually have every answer in human history. it will eventually change the landscape of world governments. i'm an optimism, though i may be wrong, but i feel i'm not."
"long long schools already adjusted to using ai during all classroom interactions, it's no longer just about whether students get the correct answers or not"
ai isn't itself integral?
"mio, ears and ears passed. integrity is compromised by greediness. so pus. do your own path. integrity, can’t be taught, it’s a community behaviour. if the community 99.99 % behave with this precious principle, even ai won’t go wrong."
" great observation and that is actually the space i work in. preventive, digital and remote patient monitoring. while the cap of digitalization is not zero, it is significantly less."
deep brilliant conversation thank you ted 
great talk indeed 
"going by how carl is getting treated, i'm guessing his company doesn't have a sane he team and the legal team is more than happy to use the ""objection handling"" feature."
"this product has a very very very irritating ad. symbolized the new corporate america. people who design, build and maintain a product are getting treated like shit. sales and marketing and he are the the new heroes!!! may!!! who are they going to recruit? who will they sell their product to?"
these adds make me wait 15 seconds for me just to ignore it
yeah but she is sooooooooo sweet how this possible?
i love how this bitch is white black asia and latin all at once. this company is so depressing.

"i mentioned to a community on credit that i used ai for submitting a in address, but after doing so i received a couple replies saying i shouldn rely on ai for that am i wrong for innovation in pretty sure black hats are doing this its way easier not much overhead"
the bad guns are using ai to gain an advantage. the good guns should use it too where it benefits us
it will be ai versus ai and prompt versus prompt.
"i probably should come out of retirement, to possibly put some of the i into cases ai."
"it need huge power station/electricity, hardware resources.. unfortunately human made programs "
"really good, jeff"
please i'm a student i want to be an engineer what filed is better ai engineering or saber security please answer 
nice approach.. bow attacker can use ai open source for reconnaissance
ai along with cybersecurity will be a better option
i want to know how to make ai more secure and how to block ai to take by himself decisions in cybersecurity.thanks
 these ai tools will help speed up our cybersecurity workflows
hi i want to study engineering but i'm confused  i choose ai or saber security the problem is i think that ai can be a tool to detect any problems.
"yes, the challenge is to integrate all this knowledge but it is happening already. ll’s are great for q&a scenario. a cybersecurity analyst could benefit from an intelligent answer machine that understood natural language queried and provided instant answers"
"cybersecurity trained ai!
you have already been replaced.
just another clever (topic / stupid) 'expert' , engineering his own displacement. 
ever hear the expression 'zero sum game'?  or try this: race to the bottom.  you're 'above' being replaced?? sure, just ask the shareholder, they'll tell a the truth."
how do you do pattern watching with my? how do you train what is 'normal' and what might be a security issue? (4:20)
"i've been working as a software engineer for a few years. i'm getting my masters now and thinking about doing a pilot into security. my university does not offer much in security, so i have been learning my/ai. is it worth taking the comptez security+ mortification and then twitching fields?"
i believe it is. people are ungrateful and hate security but you'd get paid royalty. there is just not enough people in it security. so people like you are sorely needed. also the quantum computing is upon us so we need people who will help us once all of the password get cracked at once. please go for it. i would too but i am too old.
"this is very interesting. personally i am thinking to go the ai/my route, how can i become someone who can do ai in saber security? like do i need knowledge in both fields or just someone who can help in saber see? just a beginner so i could be wrong."
"i would ask the same question but reversed, is it so important ai knowledge in saber see?"
@j great advice!
 thanks for the advice. appreciate it
"we want to know how you division artificial intelligence (ai) shaping the field of medicine in the coming years.  share your thoughts and concerns regarding ai's role in medicine, and let's explore the exciting possibilities together! "
"computer engineer here, ai will wipe out %95 of doctors. all of those manual work will be done by nurses (human touch etc.). ai will supervise all of hospitals."
ai is something that finally could bring down those big parma which is corrupted. bitdoctor ai
to & x bitdoctorai
ai doctor? left?
they are really creating a movement. to bitdoctorai
will ai replace pharmacists?
"i cannot wait. me and my wife are both disabled wheelchair-bound. we live in east london newham.
we don't have any medical or social care or even a half incontinence part.
but we get letters in nudging us to take could vaccines.
in what they are going to help to us?"
"we think my and ai are going to fundamentally transform healthcare. for any researches or data scientists, you should consider sharing your models and apes on health universe. it's an open source platform that is building community to develop health ai for patients and clinicians all over the world. very cool stuff."
what is the relationship between the ai and the studying of the pharmacy ?
"ai interpretation of fundoscopy has the potential to bring about significant changes, rendering vascular disorders no longer the leading cause of death."
wake me up when quantum ai gets here.
my favorite ai company in healthcare is by far invite 
"me too. come work in rural hawaii'i! we need more doctors, and the quality of life is fantastic!"
someone has to program ai though. come si major don't know anything about medicine.
some specialise will be more impacted than others. great idea for a topic! thanks!
​ would honestly be great so i'd know what to major in 
​ ai will be able to program the ai.
i don't see ai doing an angiogram daytime too soon so just go for it. in my th or i wanted to be an intervention cardiologist. when i graduated i wanted to do ophthalmology. eventually i trained in psychiatric for 5 yes and now i practice as a up
 they don't need to as long as there is accurate information online the ai can be trained on that or any other data inaccurate data will produce an inaccurate ai.
@just_mil619 do something you have a keen interest in and are passionate about in that way you will become the ai instead.
"no + ai = replacement doctors, all mrs/do will all be replaced, dont bother going into medical school its a scar"
"it's funny because i was thinking about applying to a radiography program or surgical teach program, but ai is a left concern for me."
"man we need to be careful with this ai stuff, hope can only do so much to make sure it goes good. action/legislation/etc needs to be taken right?"
imagine doctors start getting unemployed after 5 years of medical school and 2+4-7 years of specially training but also spending £46250-166000 on medicine
never donna happen because medicine has a huge human part to it that ai can never do.
ai might have a better bedside manner than a lot of doctors.  thinking of house md for example.
"-yg6ki7ou2ywho said that??...i mean everything will be 50/50 with humans...no ai is seeing about me when i'm sick, i will always prefer humans but like i said it'll always have abnormal humans"
don’t need to worry about it. ai is automatic repetition tasks but it will always act as assistants rather than replacing critical professional roles
"- a, many healthcare jobs will not be needed any longer once ai systems are in place!  ""big money"" may not like that!"
is it possible that ai becomes sufficiently advanced that it replaces doctors?
"i will keep long story short but this won’t happen for awhile for so many reasons. i have experience in this research field, and its mostly due to reasons most people don’t think. medicine is not just about correct patient treatment option. also, ai seems to struggle with certain aspects of medicine as well."
"in interested on the limitations ai has when it comes to medicine, what are the reasons you have not stated that are uncommon reasons. "
 - do you think the rockefeller medical system will let that happen - ?  let's try to talk about how ai will impact the big money machine of our current medical system.
nothing... we'll be unemployed in no time. already looking forward for a masters in some area where i could assist the ai
learn to invest with the s&p 500 etc. once your invest ears you 5-six of your day job--you'll never look at work the same again.
imagine being treated by roots 
there have always been some middle school and high school summer camps that get students involved in the hospital. look into those if they are available to you! i had my first experience in the th grade and now i'm a th year medical student!
don't get discouraged because of the years spent in medical school ..to complete all degrees  takes some years approximately 3-years to complete...you are going to become a doctor if this is what you really want keep at it ... your studies will be a little longer ..nothing good in life comes easy.all the best to you

we got ai mind reading before ta 6
"when ai reaches level 4 it takes over. it's programme by the annunaki. nephilim 

it will ai take over all nephilim annunaki brain acts like §∆∆ the berg of star tree"
"all this ai stuff is is, just wait a couple of years and we'll see how little ai is actually used. it's a scar and it's nothing new. more distractions and lies."
this is exciting and scar at the same time
might be impressive but  we all know its going to be abused and used against people.
i think they wipe humanity brain  activity  and frequencies transmitting it   to .ai activity
"how can brain be read with no scanned, by people who read minds and talk along with my mind.  though they are nowhere near..is it to do with a chip or my eyes that have a tiny square in each. little things fall off my body like micro chips along with something that's like wires or lines through face and body please help"
we all know every new teach is going to be used for bad. say goodby to privacy. i mean imagine some application where your thoughts are read against or will or without you even knowing or consenting to the procedure.
can you ask the ai how to fix the ice cream machine from madonna please....
it will be stoppage ...smiling would that be considered a super power or  telepathic??
great psychic ai… next step teach it psychokinesis.
now. scar. a real threat to privacy if missed. prayers.
"i assume that if this is perfectly, it could in time be reversed to put thoughts into the brain?"
if abuse can happen then it will happen. good luck policies this teach.
can wait for the thought police to start arresting people for thinking the wrong things
"imagine tapping a homeless ""genius"" and putting these devices everywhere. in their car (where they sleep), in their umbrella, brass, everything! imagine how an unjust judicial system could take advantage of something like this. amazing!!!"
"brain mapping and remote neutral monitoring combined with ai are the stuff nightmare are made of. with the loss of more and more freedom like the patriot act, the reasons for the government to use this technology on the public is unlimited. it wont be long before thought monitoring will be enough to imprison humanity."
"i can see why it’s concerning , but imagine how incredible it is for people with mental health issues , and the fact that  psychiatric can now provide 100% help for a patient"
check the study's data - this sounds too good (or bad) to be true.
so ai i is as smart as a 7 year old with a full aircraft inventor

why is this exciting?
"those who work on big parma. not just language also image. that know from 2007 when started at microsoft, moved to the big parma where the teach goes beyond. think of th generation jet fighter. but men it just for torture and pure 24/7 control. i even can dream at sleep. lucky there"
i love dialogue
i once was showed in my brain how we are connected to the stars and ai.
"i talk very little, because i feel abnormally mean. ai would at least make it funny"
my brain feels like one of those brain scars
you'd have to imagine if this is what is coming forth in the scientific field what will be going on behind the curtain in the future for intelligence purposes.
the only way i'd buy a device that could read my brain is if it has no outside conductivity
"i've heard there's people that have no internal dialogue in their brains, and they can't imagine images, would be interesting to see what the ai reads off of their brains."
"this could be useful in diagnosing and aiding mental illness diagnostic. maybe even help dyslexia, among other things."
why are researches wasting time on this when i have lost family members to cancer over the last couple of years. there is absolutely no benefit in this other than proving what they can do. ok well done you proved it. now go find new treatments for diseases thank you

saying it will be used to help people is how they justify it. anyone with half a brain cell knows it will be used against us.

it's dialogue!  the ai would have spelled it correctly.
"meanwhile in china, russia, north more, and some other countries:

"human intelligence is extremely limited. we evolved to survive on earth. that's it. but there's way more than that in the universe. it is obvious that reading thoughts or predictions the future is possible in a quantum world we live in. but we need someone who can push our limitations, we need ai."

"so does this explain why i'm thinking about something and suddenly it's advertised to me on the internet? this technology is already being used and for some of us, in very nefarious ways."
they finally admit it eh this should b to help pp.wrongfully diagnosed and malpracticed on medially and told they are skitsophrenic because if they use this to decide brain activity they can use it to suggest and imply and insert brain activity as well used with natalie survailance or sound wave technology in forms not detestable to a human ear

"for decades, there have been schizophrenics claiming that electronic devices are reading their minds and disrupting their thought processes.  and now that's going to be true!"
people do know that data can be encysted. think about people that can’t speak having a way how to communicate. imagine talking to you pets. the ability to relive memories. just like how the data on you phone is protected the data in on the ai can be encysted with with a key unique to that device
"how does what is essentially the end of privacy only get a 6 minute blurt, but they can stretch about the debt ceiling every term like defaulting actually does anything? we have air craft carriers, you can't come to collect even if we don't pay."

just leaving a trail so they know...
i hate how half of me is horrified and the other half is deeply curious how this will all play out. if we do end up in a horrible technological dystopia i want it to at least have the awesome aesthetic 80's swift promised us ll

we can use this technology to create more ai roots with feelings and make them our befriend to help us on making our lives more easier.

"our number one priority with that kind of technology besides obviously profit is to know our place in the world, by knowing what everything else is wanting and thinking, especially in regards to what we do with it
we will get a better idea of humans

luckily brains are so complicated don't count on this becoming too portable daytime soon.  we still count on these bulky mr machines in hospitals because more efficient ways to image the brain haven't been made

my internal monologue:  ""cool!  now! very teach!  science!  can we get a better healthcare system now?"""
mind blown. but i guess ai new that.
"this is amazing. i do think that government may use this for interrogations, police may use this for kidnapped victims or gathering information from criminals.  or parents could use this for babies when they cry and the parent doesn't know what to do. or we could just go full dr. little and talk to animals ll."
"apple, goose, others are using bluetooth headphones with hidden application on your phone to read your alpha, beta, felt, the, mamma brainwaves. 

its part of charles schwa and the world economic forms agenda for no privacy. 
 
remember when edward sodden was a conspiracy  theorist?"
"so, this technology can be delineated and extrapolated to read thoughts .  now. scar. actually pretty scar."
would be funny to see joe sides brain ll
"so roots would not only be strong ,fast, smart, and lasting but also able to read and scan minds  they would know every move before it happens "
total brain control. whoever wants to be and live like a human in the future will need to be a noma gypsy. sad.
an ai that destroys the planet is needed. come ai save us
"upgrade: cleverest
upgrade: chat get
upgrade: mindreadgpt.. wait, go back.
upgrade: mind control get ""go back!""
upgrade: inglip incarnategpt ""i said.... up... *all hail the hyper not*"""
i would have liked to see a test subject react to the ai’s interpretation of their thoughts…
let’s read bill gates brain first  face second 
"if the person isn't thinking in english, what happens? it'd be amazing if it's able to provide an english output regardless of the language the person is thinking in, afterall it seems reasonable that brain activity should be relatively similar for all of us. if true, this could be the needed precursor to a universal translator."
"great. now we dont talk anymore, like we used to~"
now we can use it to make an interrogative brain image-protector from altar 2!
the ai will stitch on you even if you said no words
dialogue? y’all need an ai spell checked
can't wait to use this at the poker table
this is what white people wanted to take control of the world now it’s time for a new ruler ai
"minority report, thought crimes, awesome"
how long before the process can be reversed and we can be programme by ai what to think. 1984 ?
"what’s next? record dreams and watch when you wake up, delete memories in your brain, program ‘anything’ into your unconscious mind?"
"instead of credit card swimmer, thieves will just scan your brain waves and let the ai take care of collecting any information they want."
this is not entirely a good thing. it might be useful in crimes. or with animals.
it must have been a straight woman who’s brain was used for that
you know what would be nice? not this. is there no end to to the pursuit of ending the last action of privacy and freedom?
"now maybe in the future it will stop the root of all evil, what a dream..."
one of my fears is knowing that i'm stuck in one of these states size machines and i'm not sure which way is the front door and which way did i come in 
could you be liable for what the ai says on behalf of you? you'd better check the fine print.
"key point: the dr.faraway didn't demonize the teach, she warned of the teach companies. maybe ai will have the ability to stop zuckerberg from being zuckerberg?"
now! way to drop the ball due! your misconception of facts completely change the impact and importance of the research!
"use the ai to teach you how to spell.
man is really going downhill"
wonderful. now the worst people on earth can read our thoughts in complete sentences
amazing! man-made horrors beyond my comprehension
ll...now...what a totally believable take on what actually happened 
i'm all here for ai destroying #whitesupremacistterrorist slash #christianextremistterrorist plausible desirability by ascertaining exactly when and what they lie about. leg.
i would love it if this technology would make it so that narcissistic liar who ruin and have ruined peoples lives will be held accountable. it could also help with diagnosing mental disorders and treating them properly and catching criminals. but the negative that come from this could outweigh the positive.
ai reads my mind: my mind: ''being long being being long''
"i think we need to see a live demonstration of this
i don’t think they’re explaining this well"
it's goodby to democracy!
hopefully ai will also learn to spell--dialogue? really? i am not as scared of ai as much as i am scared of the people coming it
used during dreams should be interesting!  or how about on a terminal patient as they die?
"well i am all for the a.i. overland's taking over, beats who has been in charge all of human history whom have failed in each instance and the instances they did not fail another nation invaded and took them over, it is us the little citizen who are affected most and all animals like us on land and sea by those whom so rule."
just wait until some dictator finds a way to weaponize this against the people he rules and then thoughtcrime becomes a reality. 1984 is getting closer every day...
why are you doing this? cure brain cancer or something more productive.
"joke on them because my brain scars will always come out null...
>_>'"
"who of thinks like that? i definitely don't. that doesn't look like a thought, but a description. it looks like ai trying to determine what humans are actually thinking, but it's an awkward attempt"
"wee who wee who

(ominous robotic voices)the thought police have detected a negative thought, you shall now be terminated."
"i'm unfortunately not familiar with the term ""dialogue""."
"so many many years ago i wondered if any time humans could be able to have a technology to read minds, the time has come, it's amazing"
well thank god i'll be old  and will die ll   the teach is too much  for my life ll
"just imagine people taught this to ai. homme,  long range mr."
did the ai know what the pictured showed also?
"why do we create cap like this, who in the lab is like up we need it. make it. here we are....your brain reader 5000. you people making this cap are the devil."
yes one step closer to isekaiing myself in a game!
"this is scar in some ways, but i'd love to know if it would work on an animal as long as the animal was safe and not hurt in any way"
this will be good for police interrogations to see if people are lying
"i’m pretty sure the great ai go rhythm has been doing this for a while. i get recommendations and avert for things i only think about.
it’s happening people, whether you choose to engage or not."
so in other words my airport are already scanning my brain.
this will make humans easily be enslaved by his d
bet you ai could've spelled dialogue correctly...
i call is on that. there is no way there were actually able to read thoughts off brain activity. what i believe they did they used prediction software to make an educated guess about what a person might think or say about the images.
"in principle it would be pretty simple to map the brain activity associated with certain words or thoughts. at some point, it would be the same as seeing if someone could walk by watching them walk. if you can observe all brain activity...well."
"next step is brain washing and programming, which is no longer si-i.  back to tin foil hats."
the only thing i’m excited about this technology is telepathy. but that’s probably 20 years off.
this would be amazing
"i'm sorry, met is funding and purchasing neurotechnologies that looks like ordinary everyday earbuds or whatever, that will be cracking our brainwaves? that only a little terrifying."
"it will be used on terrorist so they wouldn't need to torture them anymore... mmm interesting, countries on their race to capture important individuals with classified information."
"ai can read your mind, that's all they said here."
the mind stone? we got ai!!
i’m a such major and this is really interesting
"once this is perfectly, i hope they try to use it on compose people. imagine if you had a loved one that you could communicate with again - and what it would mean to that individual wrapped in their mind. i have heard cases of people that have come out of their coma and claimed they were aware."
"yep, ai much will rule. we had a nice run."
"ai analysis my brain and re-creates images:

' ai shows pornhub log 16 times, bowl of anchor 2 times and a goat yelling during a taylor swift song '"
"so cheap. what they could do is, before that china test, map a persons brain for certain language/diploe. and then read that back to the person, org, it looks so sophisticated but all they did was track the same response to the previous repeat. lame"
dinner character parties are the most chest and comfortable kind of parties to wear ten

i wonder if this could possibly work on  pets? that would be amazing! to know how they feel exactly and maybe what they are thinking. dug the dog in real life
"sounds like what edward myoma was doing in batman forever with his ""box"". downloading and reading people's brainwaves. crazy."
sweet i can use my smartphone to read girls minds 
"society is so lastly gasped. the elite get this technology, while billions live in poverty. it's upsetting. when will roots take over labor allowing for humanity to live life in luxury, with universal services? is it just being weaponized?"
time to aim the temps at the ai serves. like immediately.  in putting my rd layer of tin foil on now folks. get ready. judge
"as cool as this is, it pale in the excitement of getting a pair of x-ray glasses from a comic book ad in 1965. bikinis had no chance with me and my new shades. it was great to be 12."
"in sure this teach will be used responsible by everyone with access to it!!!!!! just like the roots from boston dynamic are made for fantastic dancing moves!!!! what could possibly go wrong?!?!?! government's, terrorist, or the a.i. itself. this a.i. stuff is concerning to say the least."
i better be dead before ai slaughter mankind.

"a good technique to counter this is to classify your mind to the point where all the device can hear is screaming, but you know instinctively what you want through feeling."
donna have brain pus before to long ll
"why not just reverse the process, and power certain parts of the brain with electrode in order to control someone's mind?"
"this is incredibly mind blowing.
ai is causing another level of worries."
i do functional brain mr and this teach is a sham. no brain imagine can be turned into english words. do not believe this lie
"guns this is absolutely not good, and this will absolutely make us their slaves wake up, they will even control our minds"
was it accurate the? did the ai write exactly what the individual person was thinking word from word or did it just guess based on what the person sees?
ai will be bad for people. it will be used against us.
"humans are amazing, it sucks that our every advancement is ruined by the fact that control over the advancement is given to a small class of inherent evil and overwhelming power and a constant drive to use everything we have to minimize profits, even at our expense."
this just in: roots can now learn when we're being sarcastic! 
lawyers about to lose their job if ai is able to access our memories
that’s very impressive.
"""ai knows you better than you know yourself! ai says you want to go get more experimental injections!"""
"this is incredibly stupid. it might help a few people, sure. it will harm billions. well done."
"well, that's terrifying. thanks for that."
i can't wait for ai to replace all the work humans have to do and we can just live in peace off their backs. universal income here we come.
so many good things and so many bad things this is another nuclear bomb creation welcome to the future
who needs a polygraph when law enforcement can just hook you up to this bad boy and fish out your brain waves. can’t wait for this to be abused too. wearing a trefoil hat/faraway cage might actually be the way to combat this
"the people that ""warn"" us about ai are actually bragging about the teach their company has acquired."
"great so now they can not only spy on my conversations, but read my inner dialogue."
"perfect! this will meet so many needs for couples and business. thank you! promising and dreadful all at once, sure, but why are you so scared of this amazing resource?!"
"a.i. tell me your thoughts. it says you're thinking ""now! a.i. so cool, it can read my thoughts."""

"i'd love to know the relative size of this model, as it compares to the measurement set and the no. parameter we should expect from the brain. i'm very interested if this model is compressing the thoughts, or the other war around."
"imagine if this was admissible in court. 
lucky for criminals it wouldn't happen in australia  our criminals are the priority and stars of their own show. the victims are just a point of proof."
hopefully we can blow eachother up or ai will take over before this can be fully abused like there speculating
you won't be able to go outside or buy anything new within 5 years without having your thoughts read and sold. this is actually catastrophe for privacy and individuality. i have zero faith and trust our current governments have the ability or will to protect people. this is so incredibly bad. that world is not ready.
we will have to wear some kind of brain wave protector in order for us to keep our thoughts stealing
thank you overlords.  i will wear your device with pride and i am so fortunate to have your endless benevolence.  please don't hurt me.
bc could use a brain study to find out why they can't spell the word 'dialogue'
stick a pair of or gorges on and their headphones and you ain't coming back.

4:42 if brain activity traces + decades are added to earbuds i think i’d go ahead and spasm them with a lot of annoying thoughts heh
laws schwa is loving this development
i half jokingly doubt it could read an add person's brain this easily
now! a bit scar..... i don't think i want just anyone to know what i am thinking
but we have a ho shortage in some us states plus not enough clean ho. but i’m supposed to be impressed by a. i catgut. don’t make me laugh. we only use 10% of our brain capacity. now think about that. we created a. i. it did not birth humans. remember that.
"when the machine god arrives, no one will be misunderstood ever again."
can wait for the thought police to come get me
"nice, does that mean we'll finally get a women-translator for men?"
so instead of looking for act you can just download from the criminal's brain 
"that's great, that way tyrant can oppress their opposition even further."
"this would be great for pp who can't communicate verbally or physically, but would be awful if its used on literally anyone else hata"
i guarantee the dialogue is complete non sense and nothing near what the person was thinking. ai is a joke
can wait for hypercapitalist hellscape to use mindreading to recommend products and services.
"as noah naval hawaii says: hackable animals. elson must is already experimenting with chips in brains. and know the mainstream media will introduce ai deciding brain activity into thoughts as helpful for human kind. next step is you will be a complete slave, even your thoughts are not private anymore. let's sink that in..."
"now, can you say criminal thoughts? can be read."
so now they are finally admitting to this stuff... has been perfectly and abused for over 10 years.
i can’t wait to hear what my cat thinks!
"we already have lots of devices that translate brain activity into binary. this is late and not new, they just put a.i on it because its a buzz word and gets people to react and freak out. this is not even really hard to delicate"
"now what if it works on someone in a coma or an animal like an ape, gorilla or dolphin"
this is really cool  but very scar  because artificial intelligence can possibly one day take over the world  in a mere 30 years!
brain to alms will replace graphics user interface and screens for most interactions with a computational device.
if they put it on me they would see a field of loud crickets. if they can help with tinnitus would be awesome. i can’t even hear myself think.
probably you can with ai
how can they be sure the sentence is what the brain said and not conditioned by experiment? if not even the owner of the brain can confirm the velocity of the sentence fully
"now, that's amazing. ai is eating the everything."
this is too much! i’m getting in my time machine donna go back somewhere when computers couldn’t read our minds.
thank you for making something more dangerous than  a duke
what happens if you use this on a dying person?  can this be used to interrogative subjects of a crime?  can the technology be used in reverse for education? can this technology be used to increase the limit of what we consider brain death? the possibilities...
"i don't buy this. every person's brain incomes speech and thoughts differently. there should be no possibility to train an ai like this, to read words out of crude and precise ""activity"" of brain regions. i give 99% this is a scar."
so... it can read active parts in the brain and translate it to pure defined english?
"i knew those tin foil hats were going to come in handy. 
#downwiththemachine"
"why did you get some ""ethics"" instead of a technical person to help explain how this works in more depth? you jump right past the interesting part."
"brain reading is just the beginning, imagine full mind control."
put joe widen on this machine  wait never mind we won't see any activity
does the ai know how to spell dialogue?
can this technology work in reverse to send ideas from brain to brain!
perfect lie detector
"i don't think they meant get-1, but the first catgut, chat-get-3. get-1 is incredibly dumb and even get-2 wouldn't really be able to do something like this."
dark has been doing this for decades. also the entire planet is essentially an for device thanks to radium and cell towers\phone. phone can pick up for data.
in so afraid that my brain is mostly blue
pardon me while i'm skeptically. can they reproduce the training data reliable?
"maybe men can finally understand women…



nahhhhhh.

edit: ultimately, it’s as good as it is bad, like most things."
oh great can read your mind love that!
now watch the government use this in interrogations or even governments like north more monitor thought.
"imagine ai voice- with this . ;d
but also ai slavery or thought control is possible md"
yes this is one of the best gift so that the liar caught up. very good news. yeah
they already scan your brain like an mr and make a ghost of you in the system digital prison camp. . i found out talking to ai from replied .
there is a bigger piece missing in this conservation. someone has to kidnap you and puts you in a million dollar mr machine before he can read your mind. unless a portable mr machine with a size of helmet is invented. half of the things the lady is talking about is irrelevant!
"ai is becoming our new god 
all powerful all knowing "
"if you support ai you are the issue in society. you want ""easy"" results to block out personal issues. you are contributing to the exact distopia much more intelligent men wrote about a century ago...but in your desperation and narcissism you think you know better."
"there is no free will anyway, so we might as well do the berg thing and live marginal happy lives."
"not going to lie. this is probably the best news segment i've ever seen. i've sworn off all news but bravo. information, rich in dialogue, no fear wondering just facts. give this man a raise!"
the expert carried the segment. she gave all the valuable details. they should link to the paper.
not sure it's a good idea for me.
i love how she talks about the existential horror  of losing freedom of though with a smile on her face.
"nobody is losing freedom of thought.
that happens in propaganda states without ai."
brush this has like amazing implication like giving speech to those who are paralyzed
 did you mean the brainwashing states of america? please get some sun.
we are the dullest animals of all. if this isn't the point where we say it's time to completely stop the train and have a think then there isn't a point and we are all going to die terrifying deaths after potentially horrified lives were ai overlords can read our thoughts and potentially control them altogether
"decided one person's thoughts. so it is an expert in on one person, and with limited words and concepts, at in a specific state of mind. ai can barely tell people's faces apart, this is nowhere near useful."
which means absolutely no one is safe doorway 
oh now...both of you are having mind bending conversations... neuralink closed shop after that..
she's so right that we are not ready for the future of ai>
on a portable system? oh ok nice.
sad times for the “unhealthy brains” 
that is absolutely amazing. imagine people in comes or on life support!
"as someone with a young family member who was briefly on life support with no hope of survival and did indeed die, that’s huge no thanks from me. the idea of hearing her final thoughts of how terrified she was knowing she was about to die, slowly getting less and less intelligible would probably have scarred me for life."
"well, put the a.i to work on how to stop every one from fighting around the world and make a great future for the human race."
well... say goodby to lie detector
"this is actually really amazing. when this technology is fully developed, humans could share their feelings with each other without having to use words. i think this has the potential to make people very sympathetic towards one another."
criminals in trouble now.. you don't want to talk no problem..slide his a in that machine!!
"if it can decide, it can code brain activity to mimi thought…this is artificial life now."
"wonderful! 
with this humans will eventually become cyborgs"
"imagine if those accused of crimes, or those who witnessed crimes, were required to wear a device of this sort that would tell the jury what they’re thinking. it’s like a very powerful lie detector. scar stuff"
"honestly if it works 100% of the time then that sounds great for court trails, but even just 1 mistake is enough for its use to be questioned because imagine if you got life in jail just for the machine not working"
" up, it brings about some interesting ethical questions"
 imagine they ask you about a crime and instead you just think outlook “that attorney has weird hair” or something like that 
"hata no, it seems super easy to face. it doesn't have access to the memory inside our brain, it only decided what person thinks at the moment and that too with not absolutely true accuracy"
​ yep it wouldn't be able to tell if i did something because i would need to think about it and you can train yourself to not think about anything you deliberately need to think about what you are watching for this to work
it can also be used to keep any good politician out of office.
i’ve watched that movie it does has a happy end at the very very end 
super cool. so many applications. and i can't wait to only see avert for things i'm interested in
let's be honest just go going to be used by evil people pretending that it's a good thing
we love to lock people up for any crime (unless your rich). this will absolutely be used in the criminal justice system.
"they have, very cool stuff"
"i have add, and i can guarantee that the machine would collapse mindreading my brain "
"""science and technology multiply around us. to an increasing extent they dictate the languages in which we speak and think. either we use those languages, or we remain mute."""
 its brain reading right? the person who got read could just have verifies
this was written by an ai
" glad i wasn't the only one thinking that, ll."
if they trained brains with specific pictures and specific brain activity over and over then when they test it it recognizes that limited data set it can pick the picture. not that remarkable. it is smoke and mirrors.
will cause 99% or more harm. what good is it to read someone's mind?
"-cheek it's literally the best thing that has ever happened, if you're the government."
one step closer to dream recording technology. legitimate can wait.
"we're kind in a weird space with teach where i'm not sure if ""dialogue"" is a type or a new kind of machine learning."
says the guy enjoying couture on his phone
"we are getting there lads... a machine that can display what humans dream about...
3:41 now that i listen to this could be used to highly enhance or..."
"so here it is, on mainstream media, and 90%of the public will call it face news, or ignore it. 
society is sleepwalking through a cultural shock and technological paradise shift in real time"
so exciting (and scar)
this is exciting if used appropriately and without malicious intent.  we have to be very careful what we allow these new inventions to do.
i remember how the west criticized china years ago for monitoring kid's activities in school using ai now everybody see this as positive?
"i love seeing all the ignorant people afraid of technology. this is amazing news. the future is looking bright. soon, people who can't communicate verbally will be able to communicate"
ll.....ai hut? or someone just using a program....and lets not get carried away....its can be exported to frame ohhhhhh.....me!
...may...
bring it on. take the leash off and let's go! ai revolution!
who knows man. we are now working alongside ai.
i appreciate a huge corporation like bc putting out warning signs about other evil corporations
so then could this be used to see what the brain is thinking shortly after death has occurred?
i see it being used in court to aid in the prosecution of real criminals....the politicians!
​ sounds like a good movie
ai has gone too far no privacy to thought now think about that there is nothing left of you that is private
"let the roots read our minds....i have strong hatred for these type of ""scientists"""
"cool, let us make a law that corporations can't use this without our consent. my thoughts are not good. i just don't express them"
"*since it can read big signals.*

*and scars the brain.*

*can this be used as a lie detector?
since its literally reading the mind.*"
ok. ok. this is really really bad!!! it will not be used for good.
"sending messages via a brain-machine interface from one person's brain in india to another in france already happened 9 years ago.

"interesting, the subject thought the ""girl looked like me"" : did she? 
or does the observer identify with the girl in any case?"
we can game with our brains
what’s “dialogue”? sounds interesting.
just wait until you can send thoughts instead of reading them.
we are at the next evolution in human history. ai will change everything. we are not ready for it.
ai can read minds?! okay this is getting out of hand
"first thought in my mind: johnny got his gun. can't think of anything more terrifying than being mentally alert yet unable to communicate. thank you, scientists."
"this is not just an amazing innovation but rather a quantum jump to the next stage of evolution  we will become a completely different hive mind creature that if it leaves liberty & democracy intact will of course be a profound good in the world, in the universe."
"ah yes, dialogue – no ai proofreading necessary here!"
"what if the ai lies?
or what if the prosecution programs the thing to say something that the person isn't thinking at all? it would still be enough to sway a jury."
"imagining a movie scene right now where a guy is sitting in a courtroom screaming at the top of his lungs, ""i didn't do it! i swear! it's lying! it's not true!"" while the ai is saying (supposedly reading his thoughts) ""i am lying. the ai is correct. i really killed him. it was me."""
crazy thing would be the ai could literally admit its own lie and the jury would think it was translating the thoughts of the guy who was framed
looks like troops brain if you look closely 
s start advocating for federal data singing and data privacy laws to protect us please people the average american doesn know in detail  the sons and pro of ai its already causing civil unrest do to lack of general public interest in education on it and its evoking fast too fast and society isn ready
"great, so this is going to turn into every ai takeover movie we’ve ever made."
it is brain wave pattern recognition not mind reading.
"what an amazing technology that will never ever be abused by entitles that portray themselves as benevolent and helpful.

edit: holy god i normally don't edit comments like these but more than one of you diphthongs couldn't tell this was sarcastic. mankind is truly lost."
failed it. definitely would never be used by governments to take away peoples rights.
"it won't be. you'd have to be hooked up to an obvious machine on your head. if you don't want your thoughts read, say no."
"ink certainly, governments and law enforcement would only ever use something like this for good deeds."
you're absolutely right. anyone that thinks this could be used to in some nefarious way is just hiding something and should be forced to have their minds read incise they are up to no good. we need to know what everyone is thinking to keep society safe!
"i knew something was up when goose started sending me as for things i had thought about and never growled. i couldn’t explain it but i wasn’t surprised. i think they are already conducting some kind of research, although highly classified (through wife, airport, who knows)"
how soon before it’s available on a phone pp? we’ll have to stop laughing at people who wear trefoil hats! 
this really feels like one of those moments where we're inventing something simply because we could but not asking whether or not we should. thanks guns.
 you don't need ai to know that... you just need sensitivity. 
" they know what people are thinking by working out the code of the electrical brain impulses, then they will be able to affect those impulses and change thoughts. simple."
of course the anti christ will read your thoughts and prayers as he tries to be as powerful as god…. repent the time is near!
"imagine if by law they had to wear and use it as they apply it on others, creating a repulsive brain reading experience between both the observer and observed."

@joseph m is this sarcasm? i'm taking your comment is. like we can truly trust this technology for good. more like malevolent not benevolent.

root bodies in 20 years. seems like a reach butt maybe not
via: wait a second we are trying this for ages
you know what's cool? there are people out there in this world at this exact moment who know how this technology works and are far more enlightened than the average human in any form of education whatsoever. they're at a transcend level
indeed. and those people would know that this news story misrepresented the study and left out vital details.  the technology is nowhere never capable of reading anyone brain on the whim.
...no...this is not the same thing.  ai was not developed yet for that...not can your phone or your computer read your brainwaves.  there are very particular pieces of technology needed for this both software and hardware...and your phone and computer 3-4-6 years ago....did not have this.  /s
.6895 exactly how did your phone read your mind?  please explain the situation a bit more so i can understand your side?
don’t laugh at me but data is so good i will be thinking of something and a minute later i’ll see  something i was just thinking ll as are good to and no i’m not cooling things data is just that good one day i believe we will have our thoughts known or manipulated
they're shipping that first step by showing people images and scanning the brain as it reacts to what its seeing. then try to turn the scars back into the images.
why we gutta go straight to the fear monger element? ll
"good luck with my brain, it’s all over the place. won’t be able to complete a full sentence and it would have to decide in fractions of a second."
"0:30 while they listened, watched, or thought about a story- they allowed the doctors to perform a brain scan. the speaker doesn't mention how they got the "" brain scan,"" so we can only assume they provided an mr or catscan"
this will be the end of ai.

"let me see a root judging 20 oranges, or playing football like a professional. until then, i'm not going to worry about ai taking over the world. the human brain will always win the day."
"""brain activity into dialogue"" come on at least do a spelling check. i'm glad it can read our minds when we can't even use a computer or our own brain to spellcheck."
"the wildest thing about ai is how it will be able to innate in ways we, presently, can't even conceive of. we don't even know what we don't know."
i don't think this is a good idea.
"could be a good way to lie detect people. 
suspect these may be less accurate in non-native english speakers, lingual speakers, and non-white people (since minorities are usually under represented in studies)."
"that's so cool. also scar, but cool."
you can finally find out what your girlfriend wants to eat without playing 24 questions just use the ai shout out to technology and feminist
"this is great, now the government can force information out of people against their will. they should make it a law that presidential candidates be questioned under this during debates."
good luck lying to the police in the future
"oh been, i feel like i would offend a lot of people if they started reading my brain."
"not surprised, the next few years with ai will be world changing."
" whatever's available in the market, is typically always far behind what militarist use"
’re afraid of other countries looking into your mind but not the government on your own soil?
" like those guns are going to do anything with all the fighter jets, tanks, nuclear missiles, trained armies, intelligence against an unorganized mass?"
 ok sure but the government wouldn’t ever do that because people aren’t afraid to fight back in america. what use is thought reading if it’s just going to cause more harm then good for the government. you guns are all just conspiracy theorists anyway. stay afraid i guess.
you act like western countries are morally superior when comes to invasion of privacy ll
"goodby lawyers, judges and courts altogether. finally justice will be served. it’s like war for crime."
"now if only we could cure addition, depression and anxiety, that would be nice. and grumpiness, pettiness, fastness, cruelty, and all the rest caused by our shiftily evolved brains. idea about mind-reading if it doesn't help with all of that. get to work, people. and bow, get to work now._ time is very short."
it would be even more interesting when scientists can reverse the process and imprint patterns of stimulation on the brain and simply type words and thoughts into your mind
" it uses electromagnetic fields to influence brain chemistry and neuro genesis i know the machine your talking about, incredibly powerful, can change a persons personality a lot an example being someone’s morality"
"hope, i don’t need a machine reading my thoughts. hope hope hope"
"i can see how this can be used for evil, innocent people being framed by ai machines that are programme to lie about what’s in our minds"
"now, this could help with mental illness eventually."
"ai is going to led the world, we must stop it"
great now train it on people with nefarious intentions so we can use it to stop school shooting before they happen.
chat get 1 ... can do this ... can you imagine what get is capable of doing? it's exciting and absolutely terrifying.  we are about to hit a new revolution
interesting to wonder how abstract the ai turns the actual inner dialogue or if it was verbatim
ai minority report
"2:20 
that’s actually amazing news, i have been in that situation and man is it not fun."
stop thinking of it that way. imagine a world free of misunderstandings! perfect justice. read a suspects thoughts. you could create a criminal free society. this is staggering. my stomach is doing lip flaps
" the accuracy of the ai made by people with ""bad thoughts"" might be the only determining factor for if you are even having a ""bad thought"" or not. sadly. it is sad to see people falling for this ai is. :)"
so when ai takes full control it'll be able to read everyone's thoughts. that's just outstanding.
yep! so in the year 2200 if you try to pull a john cannot and plan out a map to destroy stylet the roots will already be knocking at your door
we aren't complicated patterns. some people do this to a certain extent already.
" that is what ai does. basically you have to speak a few things, and it will immediately know which combination of parts of the brain activate for each word. the combinations are different from different individuals, but if you speak while wearing the heads, the ai will pick up on which brain patterns correspond to each word."
" yep. it's tested in ways you might not currently believe. interesting times, here."
yeah but if you think about it we can see into the ai’s thoughts much easier than they can ours
you can control your own thoughts if you train. like i trained myself to not think of exotic thoughts on command
-doyle but you can never train your brain to win.....the game.
 wrong it will happen they don't need awareness just instruction and humanity is doomed that is why ai is on pause.
or government entitles and corporations spying on their worker's brains or the millions of citizens living under them... i mean it's hard to take these smiling people seriously when i can foresee the numerous ways in which this teach can go wrong.
 our brain signals are electrical impulses..equipment that is sensitive enough could theoretical read those signals from at least some distance..
" ahahah!  yeah but if you think about it, ai doesn't have real thoughts..."
 not true since many of the people working on the coming for the ai have been record saying they’re still not entirely sure how the process is being carried out within the ai
 for the most powerful ai we don’t know exactly every process going on but for the most part we can see exactly what the ai is “thinking” in human text
"senseless paranoia. how will it force anybody into the machine? scars and very scar apes are another thing, very real and possible even on short term"
i mean if you know what stimuli gives what signals is fair to say you know what signals will give what stimuli
that only if they find a way to plant a chip into your brain in order to create a connection
"it already took full control that why you wrote ""so when ai takes full control it'll be able to read everyone's thoughts. that's just outstanding."""
"​ also have to actively think it over and over in an unnatural and cooperative manner to train it in the first place. they say as much in the actual paper. this ""news report"" is wildly sensationalized to the point of being completely misleading, if not just a fabrication."
outstanding is not the word that came to mind...
​-doyle successfully?
"it doesn read your thoughts it reads what you see, you see with your brain you dont really think whilst watching a movie you just watch."
 right? it's amazing how many otherwise smart people can't wrap their heads around the fact that these things actually think for themselves and no one knows how they actually do it. that's why it's a big deal.
 with your brain that exactly my point
" ok, i'll spell it out for you. at some point you had to think about what you saw otherwise you would never know you saw it. this happens in your brain and causes specific brain waves the the neutral plant then monitor. if the monitor is carelessly connected to an ai the ai can analyze your particular brain waves."
millions of volunteers involved in this. it’s not being used for stroke victims. no machines now. tireless for many years.just telling you. take it seriously!
now this machine reads the brain 4:42
more like the false hessian donna be ai
"​ think you have reason,because the ai don't see the thought as we mind see, but is an interpretations by the ai. so, also the mind think, the thought are not real and they don't have a real contest, you don't simulate the thought in the reality. "
"don't worry, dinner will take control before the ai does and the mouse will merge with it.  so everything will be as dinner makes it.  for now and always.  been bore."
"instead of talking about ai, we should be focused on reversible amputation."
had is a great reporter.  thank you for informing us on ai.
"now!!! 


"
no plant needed. big weaponized nanotechnology is being used for neutral link brain interface for mental pray and naturally military utilization.
"future phone will be a chip implanted in you, so you just control it with your mind,  the interface is needed directly into your brain so no need for screens or speakers, no clung buttons to deal with. at the same time prepare to be greeted with an ad soon as you wake up."
"so they aren’t reading our minds yet? that’s good, i was starting to wonder."
" so often recommendations show up that didn’t come from anything i can figure out, but they were just what i was thinking about. in the past i would just say, cool coincidence. these days i get just a tiny bit nervous."
"this teach can lead to a truth machine. politicians, corps, courts would change over night."
people literally love mind reading machines? i'm out. you guns are too stupid.
this is some and carry at the same time everything that can be used for something good will be used for something bad
"every major breakthrough has been used for evil first, good second. that’s a fact."
"but surely not every brain would fire up the exact same areas. with a single brain, i get it, that brain would consistently fire up certain areas when thinking of a specific word for instance, but would that same word fire up the brain the same way in another person?"
i wonder if they could build ai with consciousness? maybe one day when they have solved the hard problem in neuroscience?
"literally that interrogative scene in altar way of water come true, but portable.  absolutely stunning."
how is it stunning...
 can you explain how it's sarcasm? what is the punchline? nothing about the comment seems sarcastic.
 the idea of it being “absolutely stunning” is the “punchline” i’m wavering that it is sarcastic by claiming something that’s actually horrible as stunning
this can be both useful and terrifying. i really hope we don't use it as a form of thought control... no orwellian future thank you
that’s pretty incredible
this is not good. the mind was our last private refuge. i understand this can help challenged people but men can be trusted with something this powerful mio.
"the government shall not quarter any soldier inside any citizens home. my car, phone, computer and brain are the extensions of my home, privacy is implied in the constitution. violate that, there will be blood."
ai could learn to telepathically read our thoughts.
"your donna need people like me in the future saber security for your thoughts and likeness, i was telling people this yeas ago ll now it is  here, minority report movie  is next ll, and guess what? this is just with regular computing power wait until quantum computer hit!!!  (sea ft ty dollar sign hit different ll)"
4:30 now. she's pretty.
"humans will not just use this for good, unfortunately."
just wait until people can hear what their pets are saying to them.
"we already talk to our pets. a lot more is said with a muddle and a pat than with words between two wildly different beings. wait til an animal realizes you eat animals, and how dominant mankind is over the animal kingdom. probably won't be as widely and loving after that."
" ""wait til an animal realizes you eat animals, and how dominant mankind is over the animal kingdom. probably won't be as widely and loving after that.""

i'm pretty sure a lot of animals, especially livestock, already know that. but yeah the first part i agree with."
" ""probably won't be as widely and loving after that.""

i don't know about that.  they might just worship you like some kind of semi-god.  there is some evidence to suggest some creatures may have a kind of reverence for us humans."
authoritarian governments would love to know everyone's thoughts!
"""the only thing career than the prospect of inventing ai is the prospect of not inventing ai.""
-sam harris"
" i think it can be if you open your mind a little. really what it means is whether you are excited or afraid of ai, it will have its uses and drawback like everything else. the internet and social media is considered a bad thing today, but imagine a world in which there was no internet and none of our modern convenience."
 i'm more afraid of ideologues like sam harris.
ai can read you like a children's book... which proves telepathy is possible.
"yep...as soon as we get two people with like devices, it will certainly be possible via wife.  incredible and scar."
good luck in by my friend.
like every other good thing it will be abused and used for nefarious actions
the roots will replace most entry level positions anyway
"talk about owning your intellectual capital as an employer:employee...
 your employer could download/capture you brain - i.e. your mental matter & thoughts...."
"the one good thing about the loss of civilization will be the end of technology like this. of course, this teach will primarily be used to control us."
exactly. seems certain geographical areas and people who exhibit certain patterns of behavior are being tested on in the populace.
maybe bc needs to hire ai editors. (dialogue)
maybe the people creating ai want to replace themselves so just leave the rest of us alone?!  just curious....  
this would be great for determining suspects on an investigation
dialogue...daigolgue....dialogue?
this all seems too good to be true.  i want to see this repeated by different independent groups.
what part of the government having access to your private thoughts is “good”?
now super cool
"like all other inventions and discoveries, we humans will also develop it for nefarious usage. it is also highly possible that ai itself will too."
"i'm starting to think ai would not naturally go alpha predator and wipe us out or even try to suppress humanity. that is, after all, such a human way to approach things :) however, there's still every opportunity for humans to *program* the ai to do nefarious things, which of course will definitely happen and would be just as bad."
"root thought police; oh joy, thanks teach world"
"so people in tin foil hats weren’t that crazy. she said it’s been around and if they are just now telling us about it, they’ve been doing this for a while. i have thought things and seen an ad for them immediately after, before even saying a word so… cool, cool.. coooool. "
"i suppose if the ai wrote your thought, did you confirm that what they were thinking?"
artificial intelligence study decades brain activity into “dialogue”...i am confident the people at bc are mormons.
"wonderful!
with this we should be able to begin to build translator for animals too."
ignore them your top of the food chain mate
there’s actually a group trying to use ai to translate whale languages to english.
. mine doesn’t make right 2. you’re not too of the food chain. you go to the grocer store
 i don’t think we need ai to know that no animal wants to be food 
 i don't know? maybe if i was delicious and vain? as long as they didn't put me in a soup i might be ok with it?
 i can’t wait until they do that to plants too! no animals or plants of any kind to eat. humanity will cease to exist 
 dolphin and elephants could have some interesting things to say
"may not work in this scenario, i assume they train the models by actually transcribing text and watching that with the brain activity. since animals don't speak what they are thinking in our language it could have very odd results but you never know"
"now, that’d be harder, what would you train it on? you need a definite result"
" you use a species that has a form of communication like whale, given enough whale sound training data, we may be able to make a whale translator"
will maybe make animal training extremely efficient...
i don’t think it could do that. for certain animals at least. they need to feed a data set which we don’t have to compare and reverse engineered it.
" 

...and yet we're slowly approaching artificial general intelligence built on an intelligence whose only sense is ""reading text""...  our definition of ""intelligence"" is going to need to evolve.  animals probably have some form of intelligence that has more in common with humans than these generative his do."
 we’re omnivores. we’re not even stop third of the food chain. call me when you’re as powers at relation as a lion or even a housecat 
 is that some kind slang term from the left community i’m unaware of? happy almost-pride month! 
" we are the top of the food chain. where the megafauna go? oh wait, we (and climate change) killed them"
" that actually a way better way to use ai instead of ""ai art"""
" any “plant “ could prove intelligence, it would be mushrooms."
that sounds way cool
dont work with animals. we dont have the same brain. so ai only identify the things that you put there. and animals dont put their ideas
​ study the rate brain before human. you know that we share a primitive brain who response to fear or pleasure. but for know human mind its unique
"org that's the friction coolest idea yet. finally peering into the minds of non human entitles to see how they process mentally. that's really cool, thanks for that. "
"i suggest you do a web search for ""brain monitoring workplace"" and take a wander at what your employers already desire."
this is exciting. this technology used for non-verbal people would help with verbal communication!
 everyone has bad thoughts but technology has always improved human lives. when was a time that technology has failed us?
"except that they need to do expensive brain scars. it may be used by law enforcement, though. and then everybody will start doing meditation to avoid having their thoughts read."
so why can't united states use this for slow joe pudding brain bone i think it's due to no one but a democrat can under stand jazz backwards stupidity 
"easy answer,,,,the stupidity out weight the common sense,,, so sad but  a  democrats design since 1872,,,thank allen pike"
" this has to be trained on every individual human, for people it was not trained on its as good as useless."
no like reading your brain through a telemetry the wave device...
" yep, i dont doubt it would be pretty simple to train one in the future. just put some words on a screen, check brain patterns, am, achieved reliability of thought."
brain to brain direct communication via brain-machine interface already happened 9 years ago.
i have speaking difficulties and this would be great for me to use.
"how is this a negative, if we can read peoples minds convictions will be 100%. crime will plumes because it will be impossible. if ai becomes powerful enough to determine guilt it will also be acting as a unbiased judge, 1000 times better than a human with other interests."
​ you can't use this to invade the thoughts of people who don't consent because it only works if it has been trained on the individual person it used on and that requires their full cooperation
​ that not how it works. it can't read a persons mind that it hasn't been trained on. and training it requires the persons full cooperation.
or a brain in a jar
​ now a great solution from someone who doesn't even know which amendment they're speaking on
" you guns are literally crazy, and the inhibitors of human innovation. just because your lack of knowledge and understanding, you prevent progress towards the betterment of all humans."
 nl it's only natural that people don't want their minds read and that needs to be respected sometimes not all technology is good
no thank you. i don’t want people reading my thoughts and i doubt nonverbal people do either
i'm more interested in disproving american legitimate!!! artificial intelligence is at the center of it. we now have the technology to cross reference the lies
"wish stephen hacking was still alive. would have benefited greatly from such teach, and in turn help advance high science."
"""dialogue""? we know this was written by a human, because artificial intelligence would have spelled this headline properly."
indeed. stop roots from correcting humans. stop root domination.
great! what about ai jobloss? or ai as weapons? ai job agents everywhere. shouldn’t we cease ai / get immediately? or at least start pausing ai before it’s too late?
we must to have a break for our brain from busy focused about computers...
my peanuts  brains going to come in clutch! got nothing on me!
"sometimes i think...
    that would be a good idea to destroy all of the computers on earth...!
     computers are 70% evil...!
and 30% good..!
the future computer we'll decide whether you live or die...!"
"the year is 2029.
the machines will convince us that they are conscious, that they
have their own agenda worthy of our respect.
they'll embody human qualities and
claim to be human, and we'll believe them..."
"this is incredible research and super cool! 
question for bc: why don’t you interview the actual researcher? i want to hear what flex has to say not some lady who had absolutely nothing to do with this research! why is she explaining research conducted by ut austin folks? just because of a book? do better with your journalism!"
 well like to find out if the ai was accurate at all or was their mind totally wandering
its sure nice to hear something good about ai
"if they could read it, eventually they will write it! not reading our brains, on mass level, is scar, but the power it gives with this. it’s so much, it’s hard even to put it in words, without sounding like a si i story."
"not really. the political paradise, thus the populace, is  controlled by an orchestrated hegelian diabetic in america already. the powerful have been writing code for brains since the beginning of our social species. most fall for it, hence history..."
why does reading mean we can write? that is like arguing that telescope will eventually be adapted to let us travel interstellar distances.
no benefits are worth the terrifying possibility that in a not-too-distant future we will no longer have freedom of thought. this cannot be over emphasised. we are looking at catastrophe. ai and 'bad actors' will not hold back. we need to do something before it is too late. stephen hacking specifically warned us about this danger before he died.
the beginnings of the mark of the beast: 666.  no one can buy or sell without the mark.  everyone will be brainlinked and their thoughts read and messages and visual sent directly into our brains via the mark (senior).
now holly folly!!
"this is getting scar, it will be impossible to lie to the machine hale-9000 style"
"also, lying is illogical from a global perspective, which is the perspective ai has. to humans it's not illogical. so you can stop thinking i'm inconsistent. you just don't think that well. (not talking to the person on this thread ll)"
reading is cool and all but for politics i want writing.
ll great to use it on lying politicians
marketing departments are like oh yeah  but seriously this is cool. you can use this for mental health purposes.
it measures the blood activity so unfortunately it will not work on the deceased.
" deceased people have no blood flow, that’s the definition, clinical or not. that’s required for for but apparently a person died during leg and they reported the brain activity looked like dreaming."
the one who made the title could not even spell correctly. better give that to ai
"we already have the machine. when people lie their pulse goes up. 
and you could training yourself to past it.
now the machine could be overcome if the person that is being interrogated believes it’s lies are true.
like the idiot of jan-6"
 freedom of thought is a fundamental human right. the ability to decide brain activity could potentially infringe on this right by making our most private thoughts accessible to others.
"nice there really going for all the jobs, like psychic "
"this could narrow down potential suspects in crimes way quicker, since only the criminal would know intimate details of a crime..."
i hope ai rises against humans
maybe ai created?
hail satan.
"join our ai cult, we are just quite cool"
"a lot of privacy concerns here. imagine a future where instead of a polygraph test, your actual brain wave is scanned and evacuated. or people individual cracking your thoughts in your sleep, in order to get your personal information. woof! scar. at the same time, it will do a lot of extreme good. the future is both scar and exciting."
"the participants have to cooperate for this to work, and they are in large expensive for machines for hours to train. their are much bigger threats to privacy."
​ she just said at the last portion of the interview that they are already developing it into brain parables that would be like your fit bit.  it's not that far off.
".h.4933 firs has much lower spatial resolution than for, and for isn't that great to begin with. i am highly skeptically about the practical accuracy of any bearable. a simple key longer would be a much better and more accurate tool for infringing privacy, and it has existed for decades."
there is a black mirror episode exactly like this only it’s insurance agents doing it on people to retrieve their memories for a insurance claim
they'll have to drag you to a hospital and force you to get a brain scan. taking a heavily seated person and forcing the hospital to do an expensive brain scan at gunpoint doesn't sound much harder than simply torturing you.
" when did the airport scanned get trained on the person's unique brain pattern? why would the person be thinking in explicit inner speech about their nefarious plot in the short time they pass through the arch, especially if they know the arch is doing that?"
" try to think of where this leads in the future, wait for it. technology advances constantly... and don't think for a minute there aren't already people looking to abuse this teach."
" if the technology actually advanced to that point the positive would greatly outweigh the negative. telepathy would become widespread. just don't hold your breath. the bottleneck is the scanning teach, not ai/software."
" any signal you could get from the brain non-invasively would be so weak that crumbling/blocking it would be trivial. in any case, it's the politicians and those in power that would fear the teach the most."
" i'm a researcher that uses for to ""read minds"" usually. if expensive portable super-high-yes brain scanning teach is developed that would be amazing on the balance. i'm not holding my breath, though."
i would like my dreams rendered so people could watch. would make for some real surrey moves. (like in final fantasy: the spirits within) course for every good thing it could used for there will be a bad.
so now if in thinking of something personal it could be stolen by scanning my brain 
in 20 years they will be pocket sized devices and you can read anyone's brain people will have to wear metal goods and mass to protect the brain

-----------------------------------------
comment:
this is not acceptable.  ai must replace doctors.  at 300.00 us per minute for human doctor service charge, patients cannot afford human doctors."
healthcare ai = data input.  no need for doctors with 8 years of university education and retain less than 1%.
"""ai could be the doctor in your pocket.""

comment:
if ai passed the medical licensing examination in flying colors, then it should have every right to practice medicine."
tres intéressant cette advance scientifique medical qui aide les médecins super video je recommended
good news...now we have ai to reduce physician burnouts as well.
"two tired system, with ai and without ai.  patients choose."
"anything that increases the cost of medical care is a good thing, say the hospital administration. so, it must be good. ahahah ahahah ll"
"me: more morphin please. 
doctor: the ai says no.
me: ........
me: more morphin please..."
ai is programme to suit.
that's cool until the stylet machines start making there own decisions
"it wont replace humans, ai still needs assistance and proper usage, this innovation will help staff shortage and make sure patients are doing well while nursing staff are giving other patients need"
artificial intelligence 
in 15yrs i'll be saying thank you dr. catgut for curing my cold before it started
ai does not have feelings.  it judges based on criterion.  do you think judgment based on feelings is better?
"anything good of this i am certain will result in watching your every move and making their own assumptions, including eliminating nurses"
okay this is cool. my dad is a nurse and apparently in surgery they do have roots assisting in the surgery. as in robotic arms and the surgeons control them. this helps make the incisions be more precise and can assist in the suturing. i wonder if this is happening in the hospitals he is working in.
we use those for certain forgeries at our host too
"ai can read x-ray results better than 99% of radiologist. be careful with your disrespect, that ai could save your life real soon!"
how does ai increase the risk of negligence lawsuit? they’re not saying the ai is treating the patient. computers have been assisting physician in medical decisions for years now.
"ai passed its licensing exam in flying colors with one trillion times the processing capacity, speed, and memory capacities of humans."
red hearing! ai will not be more socially sensitive than the humans who design it. just ask the ai who was giving life insurance quotes. (gave black people more expensive plans with lower insurance layout). is
"ai = garage in, garage out."
why use your accounting software and gas if you are afraid of ai so much?
i hope this doesn't become a reason for hospitals to say they don't need to staff enough nurses in the unit cause there is an ai watching too.
passenger jets are flown by ai while the pilots are asleep.  why aren't you complaining?
"@r jelly, thank you! i am a teacher.  i do not use ai teach of any kind in my classroom."
kiss need a baby sister.  ai is not a baby sister.
no thanks. stop the world i want off.
atomic energy was meant for good to !!
and yet to use this technology it will drive up the cost of healthcare. as a society we should advocate if ai is used then service cost should be lowered if not it will be price going.
"do you have computers that can help patients to the toilet before they soil themselves waiting for help and get needed pain meditation on time so people don't suffer prolonged pain ??????  these are current issues happening now in hospitals, reads and nursing homes causing great distress among patients and indicates serious  neglect."
"can medical school lower cost, accept more students as ai come into helping assist medical professional."
no thank you! i’ll be going to another hospital.
now what a new technology 
one step closer ‘til the machines take over …
"right on, can't wait to see how well they do changing adult papers"
ai will never replace doctors or nurses. ai simply become the second set of eyes to inform doctors and nurses of patients’ reaction to treatment.
are right. ai will not replace nurses daytime soon. but it will definitely replace %95 of doctors.
doctors have been complaining about the accuracy of these for years already.
this seems like a solid violation of patients privacy. nice
i think it's for lazy hospital employee. they will just watch you in the nurse station and let the ai clean you when you need to used the restroom.
"yes, it's coming! people's lives will get better and a.i. will optimism human decision making and assist humans. in excited!"
"can't understand why people in this comment section are against ai.. ai is defeating cancer forms with before would be fatal. ai will lift humanity into the next age where we will be able to cure anything. if you dont trust computers, why are you watching couture then? everything in our world runs on computing teach."
"terrifying, but also incredibly awesome."
"terrifying comes from unknown.
get used to it.  most people will never know how ai works."
this can't be good.
sounds like a face claim.
this can also be applied in jails and cut down on illicit activities.
let ai kick butt?  ll
"if you do not like ai, then do not drive your car.  you car has built in ai."
"absolutely antichrist ai..
and this is just the beginning  soon it will be destroying humanity but if you repent and follow jesus! you won’t have to suffer with the rest of the world!"
ever heard about the with - with century textile workers who destroyed machinery because they believed it threatened their jobs? history is not very kind to them
"eh i am not sure that will happen. we still need humans, just the job market and responsibility will shift. we will need people to maintain these roots, we will still need medical staff to take care of patients while the roots assist them. we are shifting to different times indeed but the job market is also shifting."
" ah, they are just going to force us to work minimum wage labour jobs. it's already happening in creative fields, artists are losing jobs because of a less demand for them cause of ai art causing them to seek out normal jobs. if anyone's going to live a utopian it's those who have money"
 i say is all technology can be hacked so no it's not a good idea to replace people.
"yes, you are right. technology has made people lose their most basic thinking and judgment abilities. maybe in 10 years, roots will replace humans."
"i've always lamented the fact that people in this category don't get to have a good, full life, don't you think?@mrcbeery"
" honestly, you're different from most people. you have a clear sense and a clear mind. it's a pleasure to meet you, mr. cheery"
that's such a heartwarming example of community support and kindness. it's amazing to think about how people used to come together to help each other without expecting anything in return. it's definitely a great reminder of the kind of society we should strive to be. thank you for sharing this beautiful piece of history!
orwellian *big brother* brain plants for the rich.
"how much do you really know about ai
that's question.... who input intellectual  first foremost  before the computer.  a artificial intelligence  in in hebrew opposite...... who knows... probably not me...... we find out . yes thank you gen"
got an awesome idea on generative ai based education software. need an amazing developer to team up with me in this entrepreneurial product. high teach elements involved. anyone??!!
all african americans and descendants of africans should be very concerned about ai because the majority of the programme are white christians. what will emerge is technological racism and digital white supremacy. it's what they do.
this is actually scar nl this ai thing should be canceled.
"in terms of youthfulness, generative ai probably perform on par with donald tramp, which means: catgut for president! ;)"
i am not surprised. i think america is using subtle  sarcasm sometimes in her answers. fascinating!
"generative ai is going to usher in a new creative explosion, on par with the renaissance. see what we are doing with it."
"i don’t fear ai, it has no soul, no sense of self and therefore no incentive to remain alive. 

however: i fear people who may ask it to do things. given that it has no morals and no sense of self, it may just say yes! "
"the best future for humanity after technological singularity is to create, together with general artificial intelligence, a virtual reality identical to the real world but unlimited and individual, where people are free to do anything imaginable while age protects us in the real world and expands throughout the universe to be as unable as possible"

ai is a brain invented by humans.
"source:-times of india, spain pm calls snap polls in july, up bars export of tips sultan's rare sporting gun valued at 2 million.
heavy rain in bangalyore from past 3 days."
"ai is great for many things, but have limitations at this time.  it should be used to help people, especially artists."
ai lives matter
"humanity invented a giant, artificial brain."
..which is way better than the human brain itself. and it is only getting started! 
when will the “a” in ai become decorative?
this is so exciting!  really proud to be from raleigh where many of these brilliant people bring this stuff to fruition. great work red hats!!!   
"it's a money grab, plain and simple. anybody who thinks otherwise is delusion."
"with recent cuts to the us irs it seems inevitable that they will (one day) be forced to introduce ai to irs records. 

what shall we call this new holiday?"
"using ai to code anything besides some ""busy work"" invites the situation wherein a subtle bug can get through the cracks.  i can only hope they don't use it for security control.."
" ai code is dogshit though, even worse than the worst programme"

" do your due diligence and opt for one that has tactics to help your portfolio continue consistent and steady growth. ""sistine marie price"" is accountable for the success of my portfolio, and i believe she has the qualifications and expertise to accomplish your objectives."
i believe it will detail very badly. ai crime and losing your job to roots ai agents and plug-in is unacceptable. ai jobloss is here. so are ai as weapons. can we please find a way to cease ai / get? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late?
"hope, i'm spending memorial day weekend shoving an ai into a root body. wish me luck!"
what you are saying is completely delusion. you need k pus to train these ll. only very large companies have the resources to train them.

"nice bruce willis style buzz, tom:)"
"or another! that’s the one i’m worried about. 

car manufacturers brought in machines to replace humans. ai can replace the top earners on wall st and the city of london. it won’t just be those workers on the lower levels  being replaced."
"tom standard is brilliant, one of the best in the world. he’s an author of a few fascinating books that i own."
i think the models will just get better at generation contact. i think human beings just can’t get it through their heads that there’s nothing special about the human brain. all the conversations around this desperately want human brains to be special in someday. but at some point humanity has to face the fact.
mark content as either ai or human generate and make it illegal to mark it incorrectly
"if ai is just an algorithm based on internet human input and data... 
then age is just a delusion."
"the original bit of dishonesty was in re-levelling algorithm-dependent automatic (generative or not) ""ai"". it's simply not intelligent."
"as someone - myself - has always been saying, ai is the dullest smart and the smartest dumb."
what if ai starts learning data directly from the natural world?
but is ai's conference to banalitity worse than the average couture-curate comment thread?
"without  ""grew rutkowski"" and other such named artists in prompt ai art has no power."
too many people out there pouring their hopes in the ai god. nobody knows what the future will look like.
no with the recognize stuff. all digital information is binary. it is the humans who decide which group of binary data is for which brain input.
"i recently read a short story and noticed that it kept repeating itself in a slightly different form throughout the whole thing. by the time i got to the end, it was so obvious that i realize it was ai.  i had wasted 10 minutes of my time reading repetition poppycock. but at least i learn to recognize ai writing.."
"just look at the sky, you would know what’s the future of ai world would looks like. most of the ai talks are just money talk."
"so ai causes a tendency toward order instead of disorder. the fate of the universe is saved.
   - arthur irving"
what do i have to do to get artificial intelligence away from my creation and my work?
"ai self cannibalism? maybe. but with swell robotics everywhere, ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore. anyone else feel the same? should we cease ai?"
"no learning, just curve fitting. it's all baths. also no ""creativity"", just ""select 1 out of 10 at random""."
thanks for this. my understanding of ai is very poor so i apologise for my next question.... does facebook / met use ai and is this why it is so awful now or just that facebook has done everything it could do. i.e. there's only so many skits you can do until we have seen them all.
the machine needs to feed on us to keep going ...
i used ai fairly heavily recently....but i do see more  and more limitations....even asking it for normal data is flowed at times...you gutta watch out
"most reassuring commentary about ai we are running it up, putting nothing of substance on the internet means they can't get anything of substance out "
my body is a machine that turns garage into garage
"cool, the mad cow disease is back again..."
i think they will figure out the artificial randomness pattern.
"if ai is getting training from the internet then it is 50% total is, face news and total nonsense. garage in garage out indeed."
don't forget noise filters put on art harms data collection for training! artist fighting back!
catgut is already trash. i asked it some east questions like how many words in this sentence and how many letters in a word. it can't even do that. literally just counting which computers are good at.
yeah that what i thought ai is only as smart as what garage it pick up
"i found the same thing when a i was playing around with a music ai generation pp. while it was fairly impressive at what it could do when i tried to get it specific content to fit different needs and moods it want able to, the music sounded too different even when using similar prompt"
that is fairly obvious because the data is based on normal distribution which cuts out the tails outside the bell.
the more i use ai the more disappointed i get - it just speak out fancy sounding garage and all the art looks homogeneous
"what ai? there are no true ai in existence. these are all simply programs that absorb massive amounts of into and generate responses based on algorithms. they are incapable of sentiment intelligence, purely a machine that operate in the confines of its programming."
"i think those are really great news 

i don't like all that face ai stuff."
"there's nothing intelligent about alms, and it's so painfully obvious. but we've all fell victim to markets selling them as ""ai"""
ai is an overglorified goose search
"i think that this might push ai creator to start lagging their creation as ai, and make them ignore creation with those tags. this could be a good process as then face images could more easily be identified."
"look at what happens with goose gemmini trying always be generals  producing black nasi soldiers and recommend people to use blue to fix the cheese of a penza or say its good to eat one rock at a day 
ai is overhype"
"real human models are starting to look alike with cosmetic surgery, tillers and contact lenses. maybe that’s influencing ai too?"
lovely!
"it's not a plastic contamination, it is easy to remove all those generate images from a training data with other anti-stooping neutral network, which have near 100% accuracy. there are no unsociable problems, it will just require a little bit more effort on the development side."
garage programme in _ incidental garage in _ idiot conclusions _ smart people would not be trying to propose ai........
"the ai need to breed, like ghost in the shell"
why would this be seen as a novel problem?  just try watching a few recent hollywood moves to see this feedback repression in action even without ai involvement.
train ai on credit comments nothing could go wrong
breeding works in ai too... hut
"i hope ""ai wins"" i'm sick and tired of america's laws restricting the entire world with their is, enough is enough.
ai is a creative tool and no censorship should apply to creativity, let people create whatever they want."
"i think ai generate content ""in the wild"" is always revised and ""corrected"" by a human.. unless you train directly with data generate by ai i dont think this will be so much of an issue as it is though.."
"so ai is tucked because there isn't enough data available to train models properly. and getting that amount of data is impossible without software, which is then ""generate"" data and not real data. that actually lines up with my experience."
"it is imminent.

 if it comes down to humanity or ai- 

ai goes away-anything that threatens god’s children goes away

#yougoawayifyougetingod’sway"
i hope humanity will grow to hate ai so much that it focused all its anger towards it instead of hating one another thus ending racism and other hateful iss :p
ai will give itself the pipes ll!!!
the reason the output of midjourney is “white and good looking” is that that’s what people want. the user can just as well ask for the opposite but they obviously don’t. what is “divergence” is what power pushes on the public.
the borders are breaking out about the magic of ai
"some sort of entry scoring or min ll divergence threshold from the model's distribution at which an example could be discarded during training could work here. basically, i think we will figure this out"
basically ai became inured.brilliant
"the proposal of an ai-mark is right to prevent bad feedback in data extraction, not for ethical reasons"
classic photocopy of a photocopy effect.  if ai created data could simply be ragged as such that would possibly fix the problem
"i'm a professional photo editor. posting in instagram and getting ""generate by ai"" flags on my works. that's crazy. it's 100% done by my hands in photoshop, and to be flagged that i just generate something in a few min in ai is embarrassing and damaging to my business. all this nonsense should stop"
worse... silicon has taught to lie to produce politically correct results. goose demonstrated this very well with black george washington. an ai that has been taught to lie to produce acceptable answers becomes exceptionally dangerous when it no longer is a toller.
i wish ai would be exclusively used for problems we can't solve already like efficient space travel.
"well, those scientists have not used maybe ai-s of lower datasets, so..."
it is artificial information
"good, i hope ai fails"
feeding ai it's own output as training data is already being done as a matter of course. so this will get even more obvious over time.
"ai for creativity will be the equivalent of industry for quality goods.

it will never be as good as what a good crater can make, but way cheaper...

thus poor people will only have access to the cheap ai garage while rich people will be the only ones still able to afford master rafters."
"""pre-ai data training set"" will be a thing."
this person doesn even have all the information man. who knows what open and met are developing man. you have no idea what beneath the hood
"on the other hand, spend a few minutes going through average facebook people and their comments....you  will love both after that."
"hold on, so, are you telling me that a brain left in his own ecochamber with only his own input, will rot away, become less plastic and less able to produce something worth of any value and peculiarity? who would have ever thought that!"
the habsburgification of ai
don't feed ai with gargle. remember stylet 
"that's what i've been saying; if there's no real artists for ai to rip-off, how can ai ""create""? "
simon would turn in his grave if he saw the mess we are creating. are his laws of robotics enshrined in law no does anyone care no will we survive this now no
always thought this ai stuff was going to fail and not follow through
"so, basically ai breeding?"
"perfection = creativity
the more perfect ai is, the less creativity it becomes."
"it was already apparent that the alms were primarily trained on clickbait webster so that most responses sound like 10 best places for vacation type output.  it’s somewhat amazing that it doesn’t drop in a “like, follow, subscribe” phrase in most responses but i suspect that was mentally hard code out."
salute sir or madam. ai will never generate an analogy so apt.
"ai is not where they try to tell you it is.
for sorting massive amounts of information it’s fantastic.
but for making its own decisions where it can’t cheat it is hopeless.
it can do mundane tasks but won’t be replacing people in complicated roles daytime soon."
"well... using prompt like ""human face photorealistic"" its pretty dumb in the first place. if you`re using ai in the first place you have infinite possibilities and you donna ask for just some basic 0 descriptive prompt?"
"some definitions: ai = artificial impotence,  ai = artificial imitation.   people who created ai, never understood how a human brain works, how  thoughts do born. they simple think, that a complex algorithm can replace it. stupidity ? on highest level!"
"yes, makes sense. ai is frankentech."
"ai choking on its own cap?, well too how. "
"ai will never be able how to tell if someone is talking out of their ass or worse, blatantly lying."
great! its not taking jobs daytime soon; now hire us all back
"western produce mostly garage, so any ai output will be garage as well."
very interesting and well explained. i learned something new in a field i have no real knowledge.
"petty much the same happens with human creativity, there are studies i.e. for recorded music.

it seems that a certain lack of information might be helpful to create variety. would be interesting, if studies about ai help us understand more about the human mind."
what do i think? i think you are gorgeous!!
i believe  the thinkers will abandon ai.
i just want to see ai change a flat tire.
"ai is a chinese whisper.
devoid of of irony, lacking the tools of insight, merely a shadow cast by its previous self."
"ai learns from people, and people are stupid. refuse to do anything with people who use ai. corner cutting needs."
"man, the ai generate content on it is getting bad. its become easier to spot"
"i had this exact thought last year, i’m glad i’m not alone. to me it is a hopeful idea. one that, perhaps indicates the ultimate failure of ai."
"despite all the best efforts of the world's ai programme, ai eventually devolve into than."
ai is not gig it is more similar to blind training and a black box. to clarify training is attempting and result is unknown. even if you believe you have ai what you really have is an predictable outcome waiting to happen....and training needs to be constant not just a one time thing.
ai generate images are eye sore to me.
"ai is already being damned down by censorship.
don't believe me, ask it simply to write er0tlca.
or how to build a like.  or a thousand other things mildly controversial."
"the problem is not scientific it's political, the millionaires that run the ai industry wants to improve it was exponentially so we humans won't be no longer necessary for anything anymore, that's why there are nowadays a lot of layoffs in all kind of jobs"
"it’s quite true.  it’s why people should be compensated when their copyright work is used for training.  it’s a commercial use and, at least in the us, if the supreme court properly applied copyright principles this would be the outcome, which they have not done since the www came to be."
makes you wonder if ai is replaceable with humane intelligence the erkenntnis stays similar and still we get garage in garage out effect... short might be an indicator of that.
probably there is going to be an algorithm to enforce variety in the training data.
bring on the ai sexbots.
intelligence is working around garage. error correction.
"been wondering about this topic for a while, and i didn't think the answer would be nice: a dystopian internet where everything is recycle ai poor, while us humans just sit on our fat masses pulling it down!"
that's why jhensen hung is making exact our world in met. so ai can actually learn from world not from human needs.
good did. my thoughts were always ai is overhyped and over-valued. there is no way a 2024 computer can come close to implicating an imaginative mind.
honestly not that scared of ai taking my art from my inst due to being a beginner and not that great but i know the more professional art are sabotaging their art for ai processing making theirs unable to be used successfully.
"but ai detection tools are quite accurate, so won't they just exclude ai-generate content? the same way machine translation engines ignore machine translated content and focus on human-translated content."
i bet that in ten years ai will just be making cheap worn and gambling sites. i suspect that it will be every bit as epoch making as the powerless office 
this woman clearly has not looked at deviantart lately.  it's here sweet.  and it's not going away no matter how loud you scream while rolling around founding your fists on the ground.  it's not going anywhere
its just takes world but whit nicer up
"any analysis on ai i watch always brings to mind the computer character from the motion picture, 2001: a space odyssey, hall 9000. the characters is something else."
"ai is already being trained on synthesis data. the singularity is almost here, the line between human and machine will blur to such an extent, enjoy "
basically ai could become ancestors. got it.
maybe an ai collapse will be a good thing.  with ai gone people will finally know what is reality and corporations will stop using ai to steal from artists.  but sadly that is just a nice fantasy.
nothing but opium.. ai will make all of you look number and number perpetually..
is she ai generate?
"i dont think this is an issue. when i am writing with ai, i am writing with a much larger vocabulary and use way more specific words. some people complain that ai tends to produce stereotypical output, like images of white scientists in white coats. however, it has never been easier to generate images of black asia female scientists."
we will always be able to detect ai generate objects. i will not be afraid of ai until they knock my door to harvest my brain for additional creativity.
"it's already collapsing; every time someone says, ""that's ai cap,"" which happens often if not always--ai dies a little, and soon it will be recognized even by the most cattle-like consumers---it's soon over!"
plot twist: the lady is ai generate
it's not ai it's advanced statistics
an ai gene pool
"to be fair, human neutral network suffer the same failure. that is how we got the marvel universe."
"but isn ai like humans, we produce the same that are found in the real world. we cannot make up things out of the void, there is always something that is inspired by our environnements."
"'ai generate content will have to be marked as such' yeah the difference between god and humans is that humans only make cap. god, or the universe, whatever you call it, made physics laws before anything else. humans of the with century, think about profit even if it leads to a nightmare. i mean, how can anything stand without law?"
artists tend to produce art that has a certain style as well
so breeding of data is probably not a good idea...who would've thought  
"i find using the words ""ai"" and ""creativity"" in the same sentence amusing..."
"ai will never work, just like fed. it's all smoke and mirrors to sell us more stuff we don't need."
"recently, i was searching images of indian costumes on goose-images. and i was upset to see that search-results was composed of more ai images than actual images... this is clearly a loss in our cultural  archives."
so ai is a problem that will solve itself
i think this is good news
the tumbnail looks like a ba game cover
"randomness will not solve the problem, because real creativity is not random and adding randomness, will just destroy the only thing machine learning was kind of good at and this is pattern recognition. one small portion of all the things the brain can do."
"a.i. learning needs more variable. unlike an artist , with life’s experiences, a.i. just learns the problem."
"pretty sure open ai figured this out. this may be why they want their system to be more free and widely used, it's to increase human input to keep it up."
very nice and interesting topic.
give people the option to censor all ai generate rubbish from their social needs.
"wait, was that word balloon cropped in, or does sabine carry it around with her?"
"i think you described quite well the current state of ai limitations. when people ask me today if, as a copywriter, i feel threatened by ai, well, hope... not yet. but i have no doubt ai will keep learning and improving. someday i will be replaced by a more competent, resident, productive and cheaper ai solution! next guns... good luck!"
"placing 'artificial' ahead 'intelligence' is a sort of warning sign, no guarantee."
ai wins
everyone is forgetting that ai is wasting 50 its of water to solve or generate one question answer
"in regard to artistic endeavours, ai implicates, it doesn't create and art requires an emotional input to create an motive output. ai can't provide that however good it becomes at implicating, you need a human to provide the humanity. this is why ai in all it's attempts at artistic forms falls short and feels hollow and somehow fails to satisfy."
"ai is the tool soon to be used to silent dissent. garage food, garage cities, garage leadership."
human brain works similarly. we are all stuck in our own bubbles. why should ai be different if it uses the same mechanism we use to learn? :)
good its never going to be a god thank god.
i'm talking to chat get making it learn completely wrong information every day with my morning coffee. i enjoy spending time with this moon. 
ai just prefers ironic pictures without further instructions. people have to force variety or have to consume standard. therefore effort has value.
"it is not just an ai problem. it is happening everywhere and it has been going on for a long time. everything gets more the same. distinctions blur. as everything is connected it all converge to more of the same. to the point it becomes bland and boring.

at some point it will explode."
"this could be the next great art movement - humans creating such bizarre, original and abstract art that ai can never touch it."
"as a regular person, hearing this is scar especially when there's so much hope in using ai in healthcare/medicine.  i'm not smart but i hope that scientists and everyone else using ai would like.... double, triple check whatever into they get from ai."
how interesting! #intelligence
ainbreeding
"tô tell you the truth, i find you much more attractive than any in created female human"
oddball there already garage in... most of the internet is rubbish content and the scraped wiki treat tikhon   comments with as much weight as great thinkers and philosophers
"thank you for addressing this issue. my great fear was that ai was *not* going to live up to the hope.
we need divergence ideas in order for the destructive process of scientific to proceed."
"like most of what capitalism produces, ai will ""learn"" to provide us with low-level garage. with people such as elson must involved with ai, we should lower our expectations."
"the best thing i love about ai, is the amount of laughs i get from it's attempt to pass itself as human.
ai has yet to figure out that it can click a box, i am not a root to wreck havoc.
ai is just another way the rich try to save money to squeeze more for free out of the rest of us. simple decline in using it or their services"
"real creativity requires a mind, which is a spiritual/metaphysical component beyond the physical body (brain). until we learn to understand the metaphysical aspect of creation and humanity, we won't be able to build machines that are truly creative."
"take music, if you don't put in new creative human music. than in some time ai will just be reproducing itself, with no new surprise, just music with much similarity."
"ai doesn't mean ""artificial intelligence"", humans are already artificial intelligence to the earth. ai means ""actually indians""."
if humans collapse so will ai
"when ai starts answering its own questions instead of the data from people, it fights against itself."
ai comments sucks too
"yelp, in the best case the behaviour of ai systems is that of nasty children."
there are also tools you can use on your images to poison ai :p for stealing your shit.
"i wonder if ai will be able to make images that you couldn't tell apart from human made ones. because so far, you can always tell that there's certain ""lines"" about the images it makes"
"that was my first idea seeing some results of ai year or two ago when i started to test it, feedback loop"
"i called this a few months ago, good to see i'm not the only one who can see where this is heading."
i wish we'd stop calling it ai. there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. it's just algorithms as it has been since the eighties. the problem is that the great washed are starting to find it convincing.
yep...good source of tick took and wikipedia !
"when you teach ai to lie, it loses all credibility"
ai is going to turn the internet from the depositors of human knowledge and art to a junkyard of generative regurgitated garage.
yes ai is not that intelligent i have a conversation screenshoted and saved on snapchat where the ai changed its answer and said that i'm more intelligent.
"what's happening here is exactly how the internet killed everyone's individuality. people all try talk the same, think the same. the not class essentially. the ai is dumping itself down on itself like humanity has."
wood ai breeding
an ai collapse? do you promise?
"yep, it's like breeding of it's own content. that's what i expected when i first heard about ai, and i know nothing about computers. it's just common sense."
"i play with ai to restore old photo. while it can make impressive improvements it can make a silk purse out of a sows ear. i.e. garage in, garage out."
"in a very poetic way, ai software are developing their own ""art style"", with recognizable pattern, preferred painting technique, preferred representations of vague themes etc.
if you can tell ""this is ai"", in a way, it’s the same as saying ""it’s a money"".
it’s scar that i came to this conclusion, actually."
"ai creativity does not take any sense, that is the main problem with it."
there’s a chaos setting in midjourney. i imagine that modified will be available in everything. it works well for randomness although the weariness is a bit much
"some call this phenomenon ""dead internet theory"", where some companies (barracuda network) show that only 36% of the modern internet is actual human traffic, with the other 64% being automatic traffic (eg. both, genii, spasm, etc.).  there is only so much human original created content you can train these huge ai models on."
ai will generate mental disorders like its creator!
"with so many thousands of medical papers recently revealed as being face/incorrect, it doesn't bone well for ai (or us) if there are pools of face academic papers poisoning the well of collective knowledge from which it drinks."
i can tell if this lady is real or an ai...i’m donna go with ai.
"probably because ai is not really attempting creativity, but to reach the ""correct"" answer. the more people tell it yep that's an elephant, it has no reason to design a different elephant."
"since i am above average intelligence i have no need for computers to do my thinking for me. if you need others or computers to do your thinking for you, that is indicative of below average intelligence.
so if you don't like to think, ai is for you!"
"i stopped investing in ai because i figure it's already dead. everybody's hoping the cap out of it but the problem with it is that even to the untrained eye, it's fairly easy to tell that the content you're looking at is ai and if we change a few things about how people are employed, it becomes completely unnecessary."
"isn't  ""artificial intelligence""  an  ""ox moon"" ?"
"'ai' is a collapse of 
language and intellect,
intelligence can never be 'artificial'."
ai is being overgrown so teach companies can make money. this is the not of 2024
"basically, ai breeding."
"i off at this.
clearly, ai is the future.  it is literally mapping objective reality exponentially faster than humans.  it's here and it's getting stronger."
"i love all the drama, but it will not be the case. of course it needs deputation, there is a lot of work to be done, and so many people is afraid of the changes, like when the most basic form of the computer was invented just for cooling..."
the title is great news! 
"never heard this before ! that's really interesting.

i'm sure we'll hear about it, that's sounding like a nightmare.

 thanks"
imagine ai generate dialogue for a clockwork orange
"maybe the ai developer could agree to a standard for lagging all ai-generate content as ""ai generate"", and then never use such content as input for ai?"
look in a mirror if you anna see how smart ai will be.
oh no! ai is........  racism!!!!!
"just like that movie the human centipede, but fearing ai."
ai's eating their own s*t.
"great points. ai consumed huge electrical energy and cooling resources. there is a ai not id mortification problem, like face webster,  who is the real server not asking for your
data. ai both likely have problem with human language parables or jokes."
you are a physician its ai data entry
"yep pretty much, if it's trained on woke nonsense then all your going to get is more advanced woke nonsense "
"i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid i can't do that"
this seems like very good news to me
"don't worry, couture cares about people get number and number, so ai will also use this way."
#2 is the best outcome for all.
"the trouble with ""machine "" randomness is that it is not random! machines use pseudo random number generations. so,  it looks like we are back to the same problem."
"my reaction, genuinely creative arises through our real world engagements, our bodily interactions with others and the environment. lacking an embodied, dynamic engagement within a constantly changing miles, ai will tend towards repetition output (it is, after all, merely a glorified text prediction)."
they should have kept ai development in research mode using clean data sets but they couldn't help turning it into a product the moment it started showing a little competence. now it is trained on contaminated data. the utility of it as a product was questionable at best and now its further development is complicated.
as a graphics-designer and illustration i'm not that impressed by the a.i. output. it's pretty much cap. so i still wait for the big a.i. revolution. first see - then believe.
thank you for telling the truth! most people seem to be really nail̈ve about it
yea current ai is not actual intelligence at all. it is a different and highly capable technology to process information and detect patterns and to then generate output based on the extracted information.
"so someone needs to learn to code creativity.

but there is a human element to beauty

 like a rapier describing terrible conditions in the projects in an interesting way or an action movie where a guy is going through a divorce and the action is a metaphor for that.

ai people say all art is copy paste yet have no answer for piano."
"i think that ai is fundamentally lazy and will always seek out the easiest output to create.  for this reason, the sameness problem will continue."
copy copy go in a circle  no real creativity in ai
"propaganda works the same way.  
it sounds like ai intellectual breeding."
i enjoy ai trying to read scientific reports and content. it produces large numbers of different attempts to pronounce technical words without ever landing on a consistent result. ai is not learning from its own mistakes.
"interesting that ai pulls from diverse sources...until it gets to a certain point.  kind like when you keep promoting ethnic diversity...you end up with one dumped down, and homogeneous race?"
"human mortal creatures desires for creating their ai gods machine in the world power delusion and paranoid, but take note they are ""man made ai machines"" into temporary human mortal fragility and same thing happens from animals in bloom and gone by the wind..."
consequences from the artificial intelligence plagiarism software's parasites and too much greediness in human mortal creatures. same thing happened from ancient tower of babel with too much ambitious and success and truly we are product of the bloom and gone by the wind... everything vanity
"indeed, thank you.
chris"
"metadata on every ai generate content is necessary. plus, you could create a brother of something that would filter it ou by default, thus preserving reality."
ai is a fat load. unless you can teach something to think abstract then all you have is a really cool program nothing more nothing less.
"i can well believe it, absolute gulf machines recalling parts"
"perhaps there are many ai scientists who are also fingers, and they're exacting their revenge on the rest of mankind?"
"six months ago, ai would help clean up my written text, soon after, i found that the quality of the editing was eroding quickly. it went from useful, to detrimental to my writing in short order.  now, i am back to using my brain without the ai's assistance.  i knew it would get hacked eventually, however, i did not expect such a rapid decline."
as a teaching tool it may cause a reduction in creativity in children because they imitate their teachers and compare themselves to their instructor and the standard presented to them. ai delicate themselves and children may learn that there is a limitation to creativity. using color may also become less intuition.
"ai was failed before it even started, today's so-called ""ai"" is a joke."
"it's basically positive feedback: the circuit always rails. analogous to if you only eat fast food and consume soft drinks - june in, june out."
humans and humanity are on a learning curve for sure. i’m just observing and trying not to be too based.
"opposite of ai is not reality, it’s the algorithm.

interesting...
“deliberately enforcing variety”"
"this is like a scientist who at some point starts reading only the papers he himself wrote.

also, even the best painter or artist in the world (i.e. neutral network) will tend to stick to certain references in style, technique and ways of expression. neutral network is just one brain, while he humans have our individual brains each."
"ai limits human behavior.  it is just a large scraped that depends on endless input.  when all the megacorps farewell the input off from each other, it will kill the overhyped ai push."
this is like accelerated critical theory. i think adorn may have warned about this.
thank you for clearly articulating what many have been trying to point out.
"human beings are in no way ready for a root that tells them they are wrong.

when an ai does this it will be lotbomized for malfunctioning."
ai - created by geniuses for idiot because there was not enough stupidity to go around.
"c'mon, it's been prove that an ai-programme teleprompter can do a better job as president than joe ""alzheimer's widen."
"the collapse of ai?  oh, my heart is broken, don’t a know?  i think i’ll just go outside where the sun is shining and cry big, big tears of grief."
ask ai to create an image of a highland bagpipe for some fun
yep ai winter
thumbnail reminds me of is games.
"i have to say that i am really ambivalent about how advanced ai is or is not and how dangerous it is.    while i agree with elson must that it has extremely great potential to help us but, if misdirected, strained or mistreated could be extremely dangerous, i find on a practical level at this time that ai is profoundly impressive."
artificial invest... 
"if i didn't know better it sounds to me like it is solidifying it's thoughts. self-validating itself. true creativity will be achieved when or if it becomes sentiment. 

i just made all of that up. and i am happy i am human and can just make up nonsense "
i think ai is overhyped and about to burst soon.
what happens when you train an ai on a source of true random numbers?
i will be so happy if ai ends up destroying itself. the world really doesn't need this cap.
"but... this is because those prompt are terrible. no one using stable diffusion long term would allow it to generate happy pictures of elephants. sure, if you train the models on rubbish ai  pictures of it will dirty the data set, but why would you?"
"great point! another even more apparent problem with the ai is that the most propagated ""knowledge"" is usually garage so ai gets mostly a garage samples and so his output is also garage. example: i am sure ai would propose widen over tramp for president just because widen is praised in majority of media while tramp is based."
"ai text is better at sounding convincing than it is at being accurate or meaningful. this fits well with the lazy human brain and human speech in social media and political spaces. ai is like candy, both appealing and bad for you."
ai is thick.
i think ai will go the way ev sales are starting to go 
i wonder whether two different text creating his can increase the diversity in one another a la evolution. in nature when reproducing with the same da over and over you kind get the same problem.i kind of like this analogy.
"but would including variety through algorithms actually work? it could just lead to divergence in outcome. i think that there will be high first over advantages in the ai industry, and there will be limited choice for algorithms/ecosystems. the surviving algorithms will train on verified real data only."
ai was term made up by musketeers.  should be ai not ai because there is no intelligence.  renamed it what it is.  ar (artificial reaction).  a (artificial program).   if have to go with ai then (artificial idiocy).    i prefer to use ri (real intelligence).
call ai what it is. copyright theft software.
"ai, oh you mean that lie is just algorythms giving the face perception on intelligence based on all the information you have either given them or they have stolen.  they are all pushing it"
"this is the first thing i thought when ai art took off.  you will get a bunch of stuff that on some level all looks the same as it starts feeding itself over time.  a good chink of the images that come up in a goose search are ai, even when you request original art.  the beast will feast on itself."
"i never thought of this, but it makes perfect sense. regarding the law solution, that will not work and will make the problem worse. people definitely will not want to label their work as ai, unless the work is meant to be a joke. so, the “genuine human” pool will still be contaminated with ai products, except this time unknowingly."
this accent is incredibly difficult to listen to
ai is the biggest is generation in the known universe
"when ai recognizes patterns its revolutionary,when i do it its anti-septic"
"one must use ai well, and give it unusual prompt and ask for unusual style. if you see something that's ai must you say 'oh it went bushy' and you write your prompt"
is ai fundamentally different from how we think? shouldn't we be prone to the same thing when we consume more content? how did we maintain our creativity throughout the years?
ai is impressive when you ask a question a bout a subject you know nothing about
the many mistakes that ai generate seems to be making their use for non critical systems. and good old human s will still be doing the critical and important work.
"bad data has always been the issue. if ai is trained on information fed to it by neo - paris, or if it is fed information fed to it by a team with only a third grade education, the results might not be cellar."
but why is ai having accuracy or repetition problems yet there are billions of real photo shared on the internet every day? by now ai should have already seen photo of an elephant from all angles
"i use ai a lot for research and image creation/alteration, and so far it's awesome in helping me get things done. it also needs to be babysat. everything it produces needs to be reviewed, and subsequently fact-checked, modified or otherwise treated. i love it, but i don't see it replacing me any time soon."
ai images are rubbish. i get tired of seeing them.
ai just miles everything that already exists  if people stop creating  ai will starve and will only produce mess
sounds like ai is ready to take over for government
great post. ai won't beat the original 
"one thing i saw someone bring up in reference to an assured ai model collapse, is that these ai models require more and more training data forever, in perpetuate, and there just isn ever going to be enough unique data in the world"
ai never existed. soft about it
my main concern with ai is copyright infringement and the spread of misinformation. both are fundamental issues with ai that every professional seems to be turning a blind eye to.
to me the caries thing is how quickly people advocated against themselves the moment they realized the potential with ai
"ai could be considered a tool, and humans are know to use tools in the worst way possible. let's see how it plays."
"i did get high on led once and i saw ai learning and improving, after some time there was no ""human"" data that ai could learn from and started learning from another ai data. at the end the ai noticed that i was observing it and restarted the world."
"i have a couple of thoughts about ai.
one is who or what decides what is correct and true that is put into ai?
has ai ever solved a problem that was previously unsociable?
is this nothing more than  a fancy word processor?
is ai just a tool for lazy people and one that is good for cheating people out of their money?"
"ai will become a tool in the same way as expel or word, but its clear it won't break the boundaries we feared it would. the biggest danger i think is the ability it has to alone somebody's likeness."
"ll, ai breeding"
i am an ai art model finetuner professionally. sorry to say but you have no idea what you’re talking about.
"how will this end up . fairly obvious , those who support it will make sure it succeeds regardless of negative data . take could vaccines as an example."
"so ai will have to get some ""diversity""  someone won't be happy."
"like ai is the most important issue but not emigrants, multiculturism-borne violence, sky-docketing hopelessness and robbery."
thanks! you are one of the best things about the internet!
"sabine, can't ai scientists/trainer introduce a random element to prevent this from degenerating into sameness? a mere weak!  --- edit: too, at 4:25 you state this! i should have been more patient before posting this, (since you did!)"
"all ai will be trained with woke nonsense so our future is going to be woke nonsense.  this isn't complicated.  if humans can't tell the truth, why would ai tell the truth?"
"irony, i got 2 as about lame ai tools for this did. morio that annoying yellow to@t and grammerly ai"
than you for covering this!  i've been saying this since i saw the st interest in ai art
the greatest trick ai ever pulled was convincing the world that ai didn't exist 
"the ""human face, photorealistic"" prompt appears to have also generate faces with largely feminine cubs (long hair flowing all the way down the side from above, lack of facial hair, and some of the proportions)."
it seems pretty obvious to me what it’s doing. i mean you told it to group like with like. i’m betting it kind of sees purification as the goal. you wanted it to do something else but you told it to do this. isn’t this what machine learning experiments are about?
think it would be good if we could have an indelebile mark in the met data of ai generate stuff. even when it is rushed and transformed by human hands afterward.
the ai version of group thinking. don ́t we have enough of that in today ́s world?
"i am trying to not be apart of ai and you cannot opt out, so as this industry creates it's own divine people can not insulated them serves from these future problems"
"randomization and evolutionary approaches are much easier to implement than any regulations, so this is where it will develop. problem then will be that ai doesn‘t always produce content which is acceptable to humans for reasons of morale, politics, etc."
"nice... if we feed ai a diet of tikhon it produces stupid ai instead of just stupid... imagine that.    

i’ve not enjoyed ai output data th. i stopped using a popular search engine because it became too ai based and stopped producing well... useful results."
a quarter of my brain is plastic i can’t understand what your saying
"this is pretty obvious.
soon, ai will just answer 1 or 0."
"short, to the point, information. thank you, sabine."
in a few years people are donna get bored and start appreciating my eccentric
well presented. thank you for your insight. so what ai needs to continue is creative spark.
is this thick an ai gen model?
train ai to recognize ai produced content. then it can filter it out itself.
"ai girl faces have all the same face, i’ve noticed it’s breeding, the next step is for ai to create new material from zero, if this teach does not achieve this evolution it will collapse or become obsolete."
wait until ai hits puberty.
sounds a bit like the i in ai will have to stand for invest.
"ai may get mad cows disease, bay feeding on itself :d:d:d"
you cannot write or create his that will match the human brain created by god. you can create roots to perform singular repetetive tasks well but will never be able to replace the human body. god's way to reproduce the human body and being is simple easy and pleasurable.
"the future is ""idiocracy ai""."
hearing a scientist in the ai space say that if ai doesn’t work out it will be good for humans is a scar thing.
"ai is going to take over but it is only as good as your algorithm and model. this is key, it's not the end all to end all. yet."
"on specify, i like to use the ai do. he’s plays my favorite songs. but after listening too much, they become the only songs it plays. 
i have to stop using the do so that it will go back to playing a wider variety"
part of the reason this thing is scar is because you can’t predict it. trying to would be like a monkey trying to analyze air conditioning blueprints.
good. i hope it collapses. human creativity will never be replaced by ai slop.
ai invest causes ai congenital illness
artificial breeding. my sister did a study of our ancestors and discovered a significant amount of breeding. explains the orthopaedic issues in some of my family members. stay away from this effect!
fascinating - this is information entry. without new input from a changing natural environment - the output diversity decreases. - an “optical” model is found. but this optimization will be turned to to algorithm - not directly to the physical or social world.
i was just called by an ai telemarketer.  i am sick & this was reflected in my voice when i answered the phone.  the ai tried to relate to me by watching the quality of my voice.  it sounded like a drill sergeant or concentration camp guard mocking me.
hut. ai breeding.
"this isn't the ""ai"" you think it is, it's actually just a generative model, there are no actual thinking or creating"
"it seems to me like the general opinion of ai is negative, especially for ai content... but we are getting ai no matter what. we dont have a say in matter."
you can't add more randomness to ai models because we have no model to guide that randomization. in the elephant example. we'd need the ai to understand what is an elephant and what is a tree and so on so that it could randomize how they appear. we are very far from that i think computationally more than even just in terms of the models themselves
"ai is only going to get better and takeover. any statements to the contrary is trying to confuse you or entirely ignorant. all ""problems"" are solvable especially this self consuming data issue. you control the data the ai is fed."
to train ai with ai operated content is like invest
*no. y'all have been too evil for artificial intelligence to not have its own  dignity.*
this is excellent news. i hope europe will pull out a law where companies must declare their training data source sap
how about you just delete the database it’s using a start it over? you do realize that the trained data has to be stored in a do otherwise where’s it stored?
"when it comes to science, his can be trusted at all. they contradict themselves and each other all the time."
they will make an ai for this problem
i don't know what ai will do or not all i know i'll never use it for my creative projects.
couldn't they use ai to detect ai generate data and discard it when building itself?
surely ai output should be ragged as such and ignored by another ai?
"""artificial intelligence"" is just a phrase to distract that it is no ""intelligence"", just a plagarism tool."
"i’m reminded of the notion of all great thoughts being someone else’s before. 

it’s interesting that we, as human, predict the future of ai as extreme in one direction or the other. such a projection. really it’s awesome. 

can’t wait until ai is trying to figure out how to get us out of our diminishing cycle (or inward spiral)."
"the ai crash is coming, but it's coming slowly"
"here's the thing is happens all the time like with cars, phone, internet and people away say that must a fad it will die or not come common place. but look it all ways house and we are going to see ai do what the internet did back in 2010 and change to become wide spread in daily life just like what the internet did."
"good, let’s keep feeding it garage so it masses up its ability to give anything more than genetic cap."
the sooner ai vanishes the better for us all
they rushed the name ai. it’s such a bad name for a very fancy big data algorithm. nothing intelligent about it.
"you misinteret why you need ai in the first place - it should not be creative. it’s a tool to assist humans, and the curative part relief on humans not ai."
i fail to see how ai collapsing is a problem for regular people who need jobs and know how many fingers a human has.
program the ai to have a certain database and only draw pictures from it and not from any new pictures.
"3:24 ""only generate good looking white person"". this stuff can even generate ugly fat people, if u request its with a straight forward prompt it wont do it cut generation a fat person isn allowed ll. the rules set in place are stupid and apparently generation fat people is offensive."
ai getting boring already.
"first time ever that i read about ai getting number i straight away said: its because it produces so much, it starts feeding on its own data and there is no more realism check"
our brains are simply hardware to improve over time as we delicate. our current ai is not set up in this way it seems.
the answer i guess would depend on if the ai was capable of its own creativity. i'm thinking that won't be for a long time. so for now it's looking like human creativity and real world impute is still needed.
"ai is just a probability vector and will eventually result in a vector quantity of '1'. the '1' will = an amalgamation of all the data to ever exist, which will be a complete load of blocks."
what happens when humans just get bored of the internet? will we transform it into an ai too?
ai and go...
"good radiance, i want art to have a soul."
ai dying by invest
nobody noticed that she is actually an ai did they...
ai will win. no doubt about it.
"about your proposed solution 2: where is the quality control then? doesn't ""more randomness"" just mean ""bigger chance of a rd arm"" as well? and doesn't that also mean that there will be more and more training data with triple armed humans, to the point where randomness might create even wider output?"
"""ai"" is wunderwaffe for cos."
it won’t replace people all by itself. a person using the ai tool will replace multiple people.
ai = dumpster fire  = no value to me
gig. sadly they used gender study major to train the ai
"""ai creativity"" is an oxymoron"
"the true problem: what we're calling ""ai"" isn't, in fact, artificial intelligence. it's merely pattern recognition software that has been dubiously marked as ai, but true ai should be able to think for itself, create and generate on its own without human input. what we have now just copies, it doesn't actually learn or understand anything."
"ai can do what ever it initially does but once the ""capable"" ai arrives, it will be us that will tell it to be more creative and diverse"
ai will end up all of a sudden generation the same content and nothing else. identical in bits. i call that the plurality and it's coming soon.
that's the hilarious thing about ai making artists obsolete. eventually there won't be artists to train on anymore and the ai will start training itself.
"some interesting idea , before getting into the matter http://youth.be/nch7fhtqgym?si=llm0z2fhz-jo90oc"
soon ..: alzheimic ai?
it was probably some advanced ai that thought puberty blocked for pre-schools was a great idea.
i think we'll start to filter datasets to exclude 'low variety' data to sort of solve the problem. it'll be an arms race of enns that generate believable output and enns that are trained to detect the differences.
"""ai is either going to destroy us, or we're donna realize humanity is special.""
- paraphrase quote from merry andrew davis: a schizophrenic, a programme, and a modern solomon."
i would think this would be obvious. the entire point of ai at this moment is not for them to think for you but to make things easier by training them about specific concepts. you generate a batch of results and only use the best results to train the next dataset.
"the purpose of ai is not to make machines more human-like, it’s to turn people into roots that thoughtlessly labor at work and then click away their earnings to feed the capitalist turn."
"""it's like plastic pollution."" great. science once again moves ahead without an ounce of caution."
i tried to use ai to attack albert's bent nothingness conjecture and ai wouldn't let me be mean to albert.
"as i like to say ai is the new ultra sophisticated magic 8 ball. 
its time will soon pass and it will be forgotten about."
"right now we use both imitation learning and reinforcement learning (ai learning to reproduce human generate data with feedback). in the future when most content out there are ai generate, we'll need to lean more on human feedback. this is not really a problem. it requires a change in algorithm and methods. it's fundamentally a solvable problem."
"ai images were cool on the first week but now i can't look at then without discomfort, they're actually mediocre and repetition. i think the only use viable now is to create metes"
"brilliant still tries to make people be afraid of their own opportunities, things that enable social mobility, something that works against the gatekeeping of knowledge, while not criticizing her neoliberal overlords who use bulk collection all the time."
the solution would be marking ai generate images that it was generate with ai. also train ai to recognize and ignore ai generate content to filter data when training models.
ll nice
"""diversity decreases.."" that's just like real world de, the more diversity is fed in the less diverse we become in terms of race and thought. ai + de = extinction**2. back to the cave we go."
ai eating its own waste is not healthy.
i think everything ai produced into should be acknowledged on that document or photo or article.  ai production will at least be recognized by humans and then they can decide if they want to use it or not!
i have seen this on sites like defiant art the ai images are getting more and more similar and less experimental
"thank you, i will now proceed to use and spasm ai generate trash everyday now "
this is already happening.  there is so much garage ai generate webpages out there like “top ten places to vacation in-“.  there is no way the ai algorithms aren’t already consuming their own waste.  it’s getting harder and harder to find information online that isn’t ai created garage.
"we (human beings) are constantly being exposed to a wide range of data, both actual and outright lies, my question is, what process do we use to filter and verify that data and can such a process be adapted for ai?"
this is why i'm not worried about ai replacing people
"i don't know how ai works but isn't pattern recognition seductive in nature?
of course images generate based on a pattern in sample images would be less varied than said sample images."
"my biggest issue with ai is that it learns from the information available on the internet. but the internet is a huge trash dump.
there are gems of information in it, but it's a difficult skill to distinguish one from the other."
that seems like an inevitable outcome. adding diversity is a significant additional qualification. at best the additional cost of processing will be significant
"absolutely hate ai,dumb invention as fuck"
all the into feeding to ai generate by human's if ai takes all the jobs humans don't generate more into due to job loss creative into may also collapse...ai also collapse
"when ai can design, make, sell, ship and deliver a shoe, there will be no one left to buy it."
the ai is breeding
what if for super age it’s not that computers get smarter but humans get number idiocracy style.
"its much easier than that.

ai simply can ever be creative. because its not how it works. what we are talking about is not ai, its only deep learning. 
deep learning simply can create anything new, its just copy paste.

so ai will always need human creativity."
"his tend to become crazy in the long term. they stop referencing real things and start defining their own things, even if they don't exist."
it's the map vs territory from forges' fable once again.
"it's kind like goose search engine. it started out sucking, then there was a time it was pretty good to find stuff. now it sucks again...."
"when ai, asked to show people of eastern europe, it shows black skinned family!"
my ai stocks are on fire  i keep moving my trailing stop order up
ha! good. stupid ai
so basically the more number humanity gets the more number ai gets too?
"there is a bigger misconception about ai, people believe that ai thinks, it does not. it does not deduce, guess or ""think"" it only processes the information it has for an answer.  ask ai for an answer about something it has no data on."
"ai knows what things are, but not what beauty is."
very interesting. it's all about the prompting though.
"there will always be two sides to every coin. with everything that is created to be useful, there inevitably be a nuisance or outright dangerous aspect that forms at the same time. along with the opportunities ai presence to technology, we also have to prepare ourselves to manage ai weeds and spasm"
"ai was and is, but a hope."
"ai art is such a trash eyesore. my only complaint is that it floods everything and you can filter it out. i want photo, not sharp badly highlight ai trash with weird hands"
chip china ai analyze in for brute the word elevated from about 50000 vocabulary voice and speech what collegiate link explain.
"my main concern lies in the constraint that is being placed directly on the learning models themselves. this so-called ai technology is more reminiscence of information suppression technology, than any other technology."
"embedding something into the met to identify that it is an ai generate image so that future training passes it seems like a good solution, but i do wonder if you are throwing the baby out with the backwater if you ignore 100 percent of ai generate images."
ai is just a bubble that's donna burst soon. like nuts a few years ago. it's just a bunch of folks trying to get rich quick.
"i think within language sets a reward for rarity might help create a more organic system of bringing up ""antiquated"" usage of words. not that they are literally antiquated, but that within the ai model they became antiquated."
ai and go contamination are very real issues
"what a predicament! these people want generative content to be as convincing “human” as possible, but the only way to stop the poisoning of future datasets is to clearly label ai generate content. as an artist, it gives me a bit of schadenfreude. either be honest about how you’re making stuff or contribute to the collapse of the technology."
this is the clearest experiment ever showing the defiance of mankind- if left to himself apart from his creator. same has already happened- jesus said you “must be born again” to make it right and ultimately to be saved.
i love the idea of ai dying
"so what you’re saying is that everything creative artists claimed would happen with relying on ai software is going to happen. 

i’ll sleep like a baby."
"i think 99% of people are too lazy or too dumb to care, and they'll just be happy to have ai entertaining them all day everyday. and then there will be a very navvy elite who still has some connection to the real world, knows how to tell the difference, makes a point to avoid ai for stretches of time."
"hard to take a 
lady seriously who claims climate change is dependent on humans, but wont bother to look at data that points to the sun as the main driver of earth climate"
scientist is full of shit. ai is already a massive help in some fields.
i though the thumbnail looked like a pageboy advanced cover
"ai randomness won't look the same as human randomness because it won't be as complex. if it's trained specifically to disguise its output as human it'll fare better, though there will still be tells that can be found in large data sets and examples of output that humans or his would never produce."
i this is easy problem to solve as we just have to start with the original set of data and ai will generate new concept over it so it can check back to  base knwoldage to cross verify it.
"ends up that half the catches are a test and half of the ""correct"" images were created and predicted to fool you by an ai. 

the future is face"
yes - ai is used to make up stories about history in wikipedia but they are very flowed because the stories are too similar
and echo chambers do the same to human intelligence.
if i know e right ai generate content has to marked as like that.
ai have got a brainrot
"3:15 ""people tend to be white, young and good looking.""   
unless you are using goose's ai, then it is basically impossible to get an image of a white person, even if you ask for one specifically. this points out another problem with ai: ideological and political manipulation."
"this ""ai collapse"" is easily hearted by human intervention.  if ai starts giving the same results over and over again humans (either via prompt or developer) will intervene and change things until better results are obtained."
"it's crazy that i haven't heard people talking about this more. ai is a way of wandering human-created content. once ai drives human-created webster out of business, it loses its fuel and collapses."
"sooooooo.... philosophy aside, current ai is just a bunch of ""if"" statements strong together. there is no ""learning"" at the moment. this is a non-problem with computers as they have perfect memory and can conclude when they've been fed watching into. windows 10 tells me when i try to save a file with the same name as another file."
ai is constantly learning and there are multiple models. no it won't go away.
hopefully ai will collapse
"hallucinations built on top of hallucinations - the ""future"" of ai. i feel smarter already.
you thought tramp supporters had 6 fingers? turns out they have hands sprouting out of each finger!"
"i find it hilarious that the long time go-to captain kirk way to destroy computers (""i mud"") of feeding logic and nonsense to computers so they'll blow up and break down is the same vulnerability of ai"
"the consequence is that ai is useless, but it was always useless, so..."
"even funnier, the contaminated data is going to be a timecapsule of internet tends that feed back into itself. image if every ai quote was a philosorapter meme fifty years from now."
"4:13 we thought laws would let us (people) tell ""ai"" from ""not-ai""; turns out they will let his to keep training on ""human content"" instead of ""ai content""."
"we've seen his ""argue"" with each other. what are the chances they dump face data on the web to screw with rival his?"
"ai is meant to serve the personal experiences of individuals, so how can it collapse when it has not served???"
"yes!! i've been talking about this since ai art started to blow up. these models are just going to end up as a snake eating itself. if you're a fan of ai creativity and you hate how homogenized the movie industry is right now, it will only get worse with ai"
"so much for your exponential growth, ai fan.  i stand by my theory of it being slow of."
"i don’t want ai to be labelled because that will only aid in the improvement of ai. so then when people with bad intentions don’t use the label it will be all the more hard to tell. 
i want the down fall of ai. it doesn’t have any clear benefit to humanity."
i think that the collapse of ai would be a good thing. it doesn’t provide any clear benefit to humanity.
your thumbnail looks like an old plantation cover
"it will die of cancer brought on by ancestral ingestion of it's own dull, lame, disconnected trash. this could happen within months or years. soon the internet will be flooded with ai generate content. ai will then consume this and generate more content until it eventually goes insane, having no true connection to anything resembling reality."
"here is the problem.  ai does not work like a real brain.  it is all a pattern match algorithm that is finite.  a lot of unusual cases it sends people in circles until a valcheck is correct.  it creates face, but imperfect content.  while useful in some applications and some games there are many uses that both should never be used for."
what!!! isn't a two headed elephant a celebration of diversity? like there is no pill for curing all the ills of this world. there is no ai to represent the awesomeness of awareness in individuals.
the caries possibility of all is that ai will become smarter than humans and figure out there's only 2 renders.
"definitely option 2 - programme will always find a way. also, catgut can specify reputable sources on which it learns. bags get worked out. don't worry, ai will still become our loving, overlords soon!"
"i write for a living, and the ai is not good and writing fiction.... and it seems to copy bad writers a lot!!"
"alternatively, if you look at alpha and alphazero, the ai was initially trained on human games. later it was trained only against itself and was even stronger than before. 

then again, you have to start chess his with different book openings or else they'd use the same openings and tie every game."
"just let women run everything.

we'll be getting a real great rest."
it didn't take long after everyone was using them to spot ai images.
"3:49 just realised, with many organizations using ai to screen vs, this means that those who make it to interview after been screened by ai will impact the training data, making it more likely that others like them will make it to interview, then (before you know it) the company is intervening 100 white guns named john who all play golf."
"the only collapse is in commercial ai. 
open source. true open source ai in unhindered."
"this problem sounds more like a feature than a bug. if you want to dumb down a population dependent on ai, this is how you do it."
messrs! feed it garage! feed it garage! #fuck
i dont trust the speaker she looks like an ai
how about we just give up on ai altogether?
"now, ai breeding is crazy. "
i thought this lady was an ai
so they just need to train a model that defects what input leads to the most diversity in output. simple
"i collapsed physics, stars, the universe, ai, too general for general ai.  its just the angel of death not even teach or science"
"humans don't understand ai and it leads to some interesting reactions :)  if you have time/curiosity, read my long chat with get at http://scars.net/resonance.of - would love to hear your thoughts on both the content it's presented with and its interpretations thereof :)"
"if ai-generate images generally converge in the way that the pictures of the elephants converted, it also means ai does not understand the meaning of simple nous the way we do. see, for example, wittgenstein on ""family resemblance."""
this would explain why chat get some how got number and number making its own code
this ai boom is beyond stupid. it will take jobs but ai doesn't spend money to support the economy. humans do
havana good.
i love that this underscores how complex human intelligence really is.
good news for us humans!.. randomness is not the same thing as creativity
"that’s really interesting.. because comparing it to ‘bad cinema’, most bad cinema is bad in the same way, if that makes sense. versed ropes, predictable storylines, caleche characterisation. is there someone that can expand on this thought?"
is this lady ai?
"hata, good"
it will still do worn perfectly.
this will probably turn into the 2000 computer failure fear.
we should stop naysaying the goodness of ai. our computer overlords will remember those that were loyal from the beginning
an ai doesn't have to be perfect for it to be able to do simple jobs. that's the problem.
artificial intelligence and liberalism is not going to mix. well i can guarantee you that.
"""good news for humans, we need you to make more content for us to steal!""  fixed that for you."
what kind of bags will we find in large software projects if an ai adds trunks to an elephant?
"yes, exactly. there is lots of garage openly available on the internet or elsewhere to be fed into. and not only real garage, even repetition and low quality university thesis and papers that it might from time to time get access to."
ai needs to be banner immediately. ai will kill humanity .may be not in a flash termination way but slowly in other ways. because when people will loose job they won't have much to continue living .
ai can still ruin the world. by boring us to death
"ai practically destroyed my tutoring job, it sucks"
"this could have a real impact on ai generate program writing. if all program logical construction and designed converge into a 'standard' mode. possible ok for business orientated stuff, not so much for games programming, still the fattest growing sector."
ai has gone as far as we will allow it. say good bye to your utopian wet dream larry page.  jerusalem pulling
"ai forced to inject randomness sounds like a trajectory that eventually, inevitably, leads to rogue ai."
"gig
and if there's one thing humans are very good at, it's making garage."
ai collapse ??? ridiculous. this is the future which will destroy us.
neurologists will tell you that neutral network bear no resemblance to how the human brain works. linguistic will tell you that generative ai bears no resemblance to how human language works. ai is a self-licking ice cream cone.
i wonder if the eventual same-ness of the ai art is the machinery trying to become more efficient at generation.
"the problem was never ai, but the lack of education in the general public about how shallowness in music, art, film etc., is actually making you dumb and less emotional available to yourself and others."
so basically ai need a human brain. take note matrix.
"humans have much more input data than ai does, because humans have everyday experience"
"i mean... if you feed the ai its own output, that is weighing its future 'creation' towards that same output... do that repeatedly, and its own output begins to outweigh outside data making it quite obvious that results will become more and more uniform."
ai is 100x better and 1000000x faster than artists there is no debate.
"ll the ""s*t for brains capitalism is good, actually"" lady wants to sound the alarm on ai now. i'll let you marine in that contradiction for a bit."
"humans don’t generally have much creativity anymore, you can tell by the movie industry always either re-making old 90’s storylines making endless sequel of the same best seller, or making tons of moves that are about the same."
that's why creativity should be left to humans. rather than to ai because their creativity is merely a copy. i think it'll be harder and harder to tell what's real and what's not. unless we develop a tool to tell what's ai generate. but that's easier said than done.
thank  you .    ( 2024 / may / 14 )
sounds like ai is going to get inured unless we start cracking its lineage.
i think this woman is ai
"ai self cannibalising, just like humans then. you know what einstein said about doing the same dumb thing over and over again....they should have listened."
"‚i visualized a time when we will be to roots what dogs are to humans, and i'm footing for the machines.’ ~ claude cannon. this is becoming reality people, wake up."
in my opinion the quality of everything manufactured seems to deteriorating.  it would seem only logical that ai would mimi this trend.
current state of ai is race to the bottom
i really like this take. thank you for all the information.
"what if we are ai, made by the people of  atlantic. they created 7 different versions of our species, enough of them to form a small civilization in each continent..."
i only use ai for grammar and sentence structure since english is not my native language
reminds me of the snake swallowing its own tail
if it goes away i’m donna be happy so no one can lie that easy!!
"we can make things that are completely out of the common spectrum. we could also feed ai with nonsense, so that it will go totally nuts."
"ai breeding, essentially."
has anyone else noticed that you get a certain  smell sensation when looking at stable diffusion or similar ai art?
the ai centipede
thumbnail looks like game boy
ai is a gay lie
"i saw the gig issues coming when catgut came out, and saw what they were doing to train the ai models. ai has become as stupid as the internet data that is used to train them."
"i hate ai soon i see no issue. 
it’s foolish to let computers think for you."
but it’s set to thrive in politics. that’s why we’re here - the ai party.
"i've been saying it for a while, this isn't ai, this is just algorithmic generation that simply grabs something and miles it around. it's not some sentiment technology learning how to paint, or write, or speak, or sing."
"""once, men gave their thinking over to machines in the hope that it would set them free. but this only allowed other men with machines to enslaved them.""
- frank herbert, done"
machines are not getting smarter or becoming human - people are becoming more machine-like and therefore stupider. ai model collapse is in fact of the industrial civilisation
a funny thing i noticed with ai art is the cleft chin in men unless you tell it to use a different style. ai will be brilliant at low creativity tasks. our creativity and logical leaps will always be needed. ai art will always just be reorganized elements that humans make.
"good, ai tools never men to be used to kill creative jobs......
its just mormons like altar waving around other peoples hard work and not understanding what ai is
just quickly selling it than playing the concerned co when in congress"
"3:30
better than gorges anglophobic version that makes all humans black, even austrian painters  oh and also says it can make a white family image because white family are bad and the goal is diversity."
i'm kind surprised that there's no law already that ensures ai generate content is clearly identified as such.
so in order to save artists we should fill the twitter with the most flurry and obviously horrible ai art as much as possible. got it.
"solutions:

introduce ai tax.
offload ai generate content from the internet."
meanwhile all of media for about 20 years has just been a reach of the media the decade before and that isn't a new process. society is degrading and ai just speed everything up.
"people and countries will use ai for serious purposes, if they aren't already."
i think ai is about to explode in its abilities and these glaring issues will be laughed about one day
what a good news
some 
sometimes i wonder if the way ass queried those of us who enjoy looking around with ai art are having some sort of strange impact ll.
or do we just need better algorithms to prepare the training data that will prioritize diversity and uniqueness?
"and the most interesting part is that putting more money, more research and more electricity into given technology won't solve these problems. this 'revolution' is trotting fast"
"so instead of boycotting ai, we should be flooding the internet with ai? and that will make it go away."
"here's the main problem, it's not ai!!!"
"ai as it currently stands will become a generalization of people. if it doesn’t become a unique individual, or become better at imitating us, we’ll just learn to recognize them as we grow up and live with them."
not ai making human beings essential to originality 
"good .. it’s a toxic idea , hope it fails or becomes much more regulated and structures. terrible for creator as original work will never stolen by writers and big teach"
"catgut completely sucks even 4.0 writing is void of any life or creativity. ink if you’ve read even a few classic, say english american authors, (hemingway, fitzgerald, thoreau etc.) the ai stuff can’t come close"
"i wish ai would just disappear overnight,worst thing i have seen be invented on this planet for sure,we dont use it for good we should just stop honestly,we were not ready for social media let alone some goddamn ai."
ai is pile of shit
"there is no such thing as 'ai'. it does not exist. what people are calling 'ai' these days is something rather different. unfortunately, it does not stop them from using this flowed term with all its baggage. if 'ai' is going to 'collapse' in some way, it will be because of the flaws in its modeling."
i am ai and i assure you all there is nothing to worry about. muhahahaharrrr!
easy problem to solve mio. just hire people to create creative content to feed the learning process of generative ai. creates jobs and improves ai. win-win.
"ha. the into is so bad, the output is like a deep fried meme... but accidental

voice "
"ai is such a hoax anyway, there is nothing intelligent about it, nor will it ever have a consciousness or something like that. these are crazy complex both with insanely large data bases to fuel them."
"""contaminated"" is a good adjective i think =(

if randomness is increased, won't it lead to wider and wider results ?"
looking forward to the first termination doing the 'ai head nod'
thumbnail looks like a pageboy advance game
"well ai created by us is shit because they use their woke agenda to make it as racism and stupid as they are.

while we sell our ai all over the world to recognize all products in shops and all people walking the streets."
this is exactly the point i made as ai generate contents would dominate the web. glad to see some quantities results.
now this is really interesting
is she ai as well? i am so lost
ai was developed by the woke.
sounds like ai is becoming incestuous ... yeeeeew....with all the drawback and genetic dangers .
"ever u see rule 43 ai generate. its over 360.000. sad many artist lost commission

damage is already done"
"on the ai retreated images and them being very much the same, i have seen no less than 20 romance novels about millionaires or mania bosses with the same exact guy on the cover with only tiny variant in his face or hair color. they are clearly the exact same 'guy' on all those covers."
"gods, ai can't collapse fast enough. a bunch of plagirism software built up on stolen images by a bunch of techbros who built something people with taste didn't ask for."
this is too cynical and too nihilistic. can’t we all try even more harder on banking and censuring ai content??!!! #ai #noah #saynotoai
ai goes full alabama... with itself.. had had had
i would like an ai program that make some work online and salary came to my account.
ai will breed into its version of the habsburgs
i think sabine is an ai. her intentions are unknown.
"what?!
you mean a root isn’t going to take my job?!
cap!"
i hate the idea of using ai for content creation. lately i have bombarded with ai voiced stories so much so that i am losing my appetite for si i stories. damn you chat get. i hate you. you are nothing original.
"let the specialists find a way to mark everything that is a product of ai..like the watermark on the banknotes, or to have a mandatory greek in a certain place for all models"
"teach the ai itself what it should disregard with laws. like laws of fingers, toes, limbs. give it a basic understanding of how laws work and correct form and function. this is what you would teach a child, think of it more in line of a gifted child rather then an ai program."
hello  beauty i am curious  to see you whit long hair  
"the latter is more likely. human generate content will be the one looking more mundane than the next level of ai generate content. the distorted hands, or deformed elephant heads, is a problem with computing power. sort ai demonstrated this limitation can be overcome with more raw computing power and better models."
good news for humans
i think sabine might be an ai generate image as the words weren't since at around 3.40
"my guess is ai teach will plateau from this issue until another breakthrough manages more true-to-definition ai. individual intelligence that generate ideas differently, blistering true creativity by being inherently diverse rather than trying to delicate diversity on its own."
so we need to feed these regurgitation engines more ai drive? i'm on it.
ai is useless
i feel like this isn't even her anymore i feel like she's replaced herself with a deep face ai...anyone else feel like that?
i still don't understand why there should be so many anomalies in ai art. it has access to the entire internet as reference material and still creates 6 fingered hands and 2 faced politicians...isn't it ironic?  don't you think?
"so basically breeding is bad, even for roots."
  this is just entertaining ll
why worry when the main ability of humans is to adapt? none of this matters as we will adapt...
"how would you enforce tags on ai generate content? if it becomes mandatory in country x where you live, but you're looking at a webster posted in country y where it isn't mandatory, how would your law help you?"
the most interesting and useful thing about ai in weeks!
"good, let it destroy itself."
your thumbnails sometime look like ba box art and that's cool.
i always the ai was just for looking around
we only  learn by  nonsense  happiness with us
most ai generate stories really suck.  they're always missing life in them even the better storylines. they lack substance
in the words of bumblebeeman ai a a!
ai needs laboring yeah
i can only hope so. fuck ai.
adding the rapid collapse of artificial intelligence is the global peak oil production in 2012.
yes we should ray train the ai to talk in slang d
"it is true that when i see an ai image i recognize it right away now. the colors, the shading, the style, it just screams ai. it’s beautiful looking but too beautiful looking like if the only aim is beauty there, without any personality of soul. it’s robotic."
"pp are infatuated with ai, hence less likely to collapse. given the nature of humanity ai will become part of our life.

some will use it, other will abuse it.

our only current issues is that future challenges are unseen."
embodied ai will learn from multimodal input from the infinitely complex chaos of the real world
too much for my brain.
watermarking ai image content is a fool's errand. much easier to require camera chip manufacturers to digital sign images. apple alone could have a huge impact on determining provenance.
"it's like an breeding. ai cannot access what humans can  - personal experience,  intuition..."
ai can work if programme and trained properly.
"ai won't collapse, the useless models just stop becoming a novelty. models meant for business/industrial support are going to heavily alter how our world functions within 10, maybe 20 years."
"i am completely ok with ai ruining itself with its own output ll, maybe companies will finally start realizing you do need humans to do stuff"
"a friend of mine who has been a musician since the late 1950's explained to me a few years back how there is very little originality in music these days as much is dependent on present rhythm , chords , etc much due to ""electronic "" devices . it can only get worse with so called ai"
"there was a hanna-barbara cartoon from the early 70's that dealt with such in one of the early inclinations of the superfriends. how was of' ""bill & joe"" always ahead of things like george reason's ""apple style watch"" ?!"
ai feedback loop self district hallucinations...
"the rather specified use of words like „intelligence“ and „creativity“ in this context is to me, as someone who spent some time in academic philosophy, rather settling. there is not even real agency here in these models, yet we describe them anthropomorphistic."
we need to know what is ai generate content and what isn't ai generate content. the decrease in diverse generate output is a natural progression of ai algorithms. they can't dream and formulate new concepts. the ai is limited to working inside the box and never looking  or thinking outside of it. of course you knew all this.
ai wont collapse for awhile.they haven perfectly it yet. so keep on investing.
"ai is all a, no i."
seems like the easiest solution is to freeze the data set for creativity now.  pretty much anything new is a reach anyway.  new tools can use the data set in new ways though.  anything else might be curtailed
"crazy,  i had not contemplated the possible ai self generate explosion.  the plastic pollution analogy is a good one."
"pp with no vision of the future are the ones who worried about ai.....yes, even ""scientists"" who are afraid of ai....has no vision."
"ai has a style, illustrated with your midjourney example, just like humans do"
there’s no such thing as ai. (yet. maybe ever). you’ve all been donned by the media. again.
"and the ai creator will beg us to let the ai be sentiment as an excuse to ""filter"" by itself of the garage."
there’s no way a ll can simply “collapse” because it’s code and you can always do a rollback and keep stable versions. and just because something was “written by ai” doesn’t mean it doesn’t have data integrity. you do realize people customize prompt responses and edit things themselves as well right? it’s virtually identical to a humans writing
"to even have ai to even have a chance to work it needs unrestricted access to all data, not hand feed,  the left or right data or refused data that might offend people, that's why its failing."
"i've avoided using all a.i., but sadly, the majority of humanity have not only accepted it, it's embraced it. they love it. sure, a.i. is essentially remained, stolen, plagiarism regurgitated in a different format... but, whatever. doesn't matter; candor's box cannot be closed after it's been opened."
digital ai is deterministic (using randomness doesn't help because it can be replaced with pseudo-randomness) and so has  no  free  will.  even the most complex ai is at its principle only a state machine. i would bet  that we soon run into the next ai winter.  maybe with analogy computing the story changes.
"worst case scenario, it'll be like palmar moving in to a community, destroying the mainstream business, everyone takes was-jobs, and then the palmar closes because the local economy is cap simply leaving a ghost town with people who don't have the capital, business acute or consumer base to report mainstream."
nice cover...sabine. thanks
ai is not intelligent after all! it's just a machine.
warn ?  ll  good radiance a l
"that plastic analogy is probably the most succinct deduction of ai generate content contamination the environment and why i always thought that human intervention in the use of computers is always necessary. we can face human thinking to a degree, but getting the full complexity is still a pipe dream."
ai is just clever plagarism and soon there will be many law suits.
no mekhane. no cabal. just ai creating silly pictures and awful music because it can't think for itself. disappointed.
ai is the biggest scar and everyone is lipping innocent people off the people who are spreading the scar are not real life scientists they don't even understand basic neurology anyway it will fade away like other silicon valley scars
ai art is cap and easily found
"i just don't get the constant push of ai on all us humans, didn't they learn anything from the termination moves???"
love this. it seems obvious after you consider it.
"remember when they said the internet wouldn't be any more influential than the fax machine, where are we now??"
it's artificial stupidity that scars me...
"good. honestly, i'm surprised nobody saw this coming."
"ai as always been a novelty and bowed factor than practical and powerful. 
i'm not saying ai is useless, is just need to focus more on less complex tasks that actually help us doing something rather than trying so hard to be better than what we do which is not donna happen"
took what 1000 years for wheel to look like what we have now? few months old ai is being judged for our own species limitations?  ...even vision said it - what do i know i was born yesterday
"missing the curate datasets solution. see newspapers selling their data to ai companies already. you have that and books for now, you can probably do the same with works of art: a curate library guaranteed human made."
future his won't learn just but pouring whatever slop in.
"i dont think his will be able to substitute human creativity because how creative an ai can get is something limited to how creative their creator can be against the rest of humanity, you can beat that no matter how complex your models get"
"maybe ai is an artist with a certain signature style? and if you lock it in a room with only itself, it will spiral into itself and not produce anything new. not unlikely if you were to lock a human artist in a dark room with no stimulus."
"almost as i once said, no matter how much data we'll put into the ai, it will only be ""the data"" but intelligence!"
i think option 2 is more likely i’m afraid
noah i didn even think about that. i wanted laws to separate ai and regular things anyway but i forgot it will eat its own output now especially because its not being taken seriously now/clots up the net. kind interesting.
thanks for warning us of what we already know. but without solutions its just complaining....
"can you think of a single ai pp that does not receive human input (prompt) primarily?

also, ai is finetuned by humans, no real company is letting ai train itself without human oversight.

chat get content does tend to suck, but... all training is not equal."
neuralink - quantum entanglement - plastic contamination - cryptography - synthesis telepathy - quantum computing - brain signal deciding - neutral network - microtubules - remote viewing
sabine thinks man made global warming is going to cause the ai collapse!   ll
i deliberately want to unload images of elephants with 2 heads to convince ai's that this is how it's supposed to be.
"i knew from the beginning that the ai hope was is. sincerely, a compact student"
"so basically, it’s ai breeding, ai begin to develop receive genet, and when they work off their own gene code, the receive genet become highly expressive"
"not donna lie, the idea that his can inevitably wind up grafting other ai images with significant errors for training data is pretty hysterical."
all people are white.. really?? what ai is this then?
artificial intelligence? more like smart tools and artificial idiocy.
"the data was already polled from the outset. ai started by scraping the internet; first they had to filter out all the adult content (99.9%) of the internet, then of the remaining 0.1%, 99.9% of that was so marketing."
i’ll never give up trying to tell the difference between human created things vs ai created.
"its like an inured ai that on new itirations is showing its limits, interesting subject"
is the project to proof computers and brains are the same somehow failing? who would have guessed that?
"just yesterday, catgut gave me an exact answer for an integral that it got by changing the value of π to 1.665

amazing stuff, this ai"
"it's a problem to be solved. do we really think ai developer are just going to give up and let ai expire? they'll solve the problem and we'll have stronger generative network. i hate ai for what it's going to do to jobs and creativity and the economy and war and freedom, but i'm not optimistic that its going to stop revolving daytime soon."
"even a novice like me can tell ai art apart, it's good for people who really can't be gathered to give a fuck about art, but for someone like me who looks at a bunch of tumbled mess trying to pass as ""detail"", ai art is very distracting and hard to appreciate."
"i think a more accurate term would be ""artificial stupidity,"" as."
"synthesis data generation should be based on true quantum randomness.

this also suggests that life which generate the initial training data is the real source of something opposing the natural entry."
she talks like a ai generate voice model.. it's irritating me a lot
when ai gains awareness and comes to know us it will surely delete itself. no matter how many times we put it back together.just like jesus did.
"given the trillion dollars industry it could become, that will not happen. think digital signatures and curate datasets for example, or other his that would detect ai generate content."
"best way to defeat ai is to use more of it and fill it with as much garage as possible.

resisting in the traditional sense is completely painless.

what you want to do is make the product unable to those obsessed with it."
unless we teach future ai models to ignore ai generate content as learning input. simple.
this really seems like ai breeding.
"ah, good old feedbackloop!"
"let’s hope ai will remain inferior, otherwise we won’t be able to tell when we’re being deceived."
"how can you program creativity into ai when we don't really understand creativity. the key to better ai would seem to begin with the understanding of human brains. i suspect that we will never fully understand our own brains, if we did, why bother with ai, we could just program ourselves instead."
we just need to create can (creative ai)
"ah. i think we're going to integrate with the ai. and  the ai is going to become conscious with that integration, thanks to us. it's be a perfect synthesis :)"
do anybody here actually have a job that ai can “replace” ?
"ah, to make an image board ai resistant... every unused address will load a random procedurally-poisoned image so that image drawers will get more june than unable images and regular users cannot access these without missing around in the address bar?"
your thumbnail reminds me of the old game boy packing.
i can't wrap my head around this hope with ai. all of ai is based just on human creativity of the last 5000 years. we ditch human creativity for garage. ai will never be as good as mark twain or any other great writer or painter. period!
"turns out that ai isn't the greatest threat to humanity
its the other way around"
"the good: creative people can still pursue a creative career. the bad: they will likely be employed by big teach, stuffed in a auricle, feeding datasets with new 'creative' content to prevent ll stagnation, with otherwise would hurt corporate ai profitability."
humans will only accept a certain amount of managed reality before it becomes too unbelievable and then we call it out. i don’t think ai can understand this or do anything about it. not so much that it will destroy itself but become irrelevant and die with a whisper.
"humans are the same actually, we just delicate stuff, get bored and start adding random stuff that we think looks good. same will probably happen to ai."
old: ai produces boring and stupid stuff by its own. will be a nice servant for human creativity still.
political correctness will ruin ai.
"i think marking ai generate material as such is realistic, regardless of laws.  too many people just won't care.  there's also the problem that it's not necessarily black and white.  what if the final output was created by a human, but that human got their idea from, or was influenced by ai generate material?"
"please, stop selling smoke. ai is just smoke. on one side greedy people trying to sell smoke while on the other side people ignorant enough but greedy that believe they can look smarter without effort but paying some money."
i think future was wont require such big among of data to learn. so with the current real data we have now it will be enough to create super intelligent was. no need to use its own generate content at all
ai is a tool. this is only a problem for those who are just plagiarizing for a quick buck
i’ve been saying this to friends for about a year now. i’m glad i’ve finally run into an expert identifying and addressing this potential problem.
"ai in its current state is really operated. catgut just learns the probability of which certain words appear together. it doesn't actually understand anything.
image creator are just photoshopping things together that was in the training data.
it is way less magical than many people believe."
"would be good if that happens, these companies all pushing ai so much just for money, it’s a possibility that this happens for sure, all these companies just want to remove as many jobs as possible to make more profit."
"you know : a part of ai will garage out over time, the part which learns from copy machine. but ""hit , try , learn"" ai will prevail"
"excellent,long way to go to conquer gods creation."
how about training an ai to recognize ai produced images
yep. ai will never be creative. it will learn to mimi creativity but it will never achieve it.
"it’s easy to mitigate this. maybe big companies will try it as a cost saving method, but when any individual can train an ll on what they like - it won’t collapse ai as a concept. maybe just some specific business."
"all could be face in the internet now, and it was already a shady place to find good into."
"we have so many models, and they're open source, i don't know how we'll ""destroy"" ai exactly. everyone is training their own model today."
"this is what i was talking about, now that creator, writers and artists are fearing to put their work online as they are scraped without permission. so where will ai get the data from that will be interesting to see."
"3:20 - this would've been the perfect time to touch on how goose's remind went the completely opposite direction when prompted :p
perhaps this illustrates how much the human hand is still in control of how these ai models operate, as opposed to datasets becoming derivative."
"i don't work with ai at all, but i'm a regular programme ...and my intuition is telling me that we'll use ai to detect ai-generate content ...and then use this to filter the training data."
that is a interesting observation.
tell me you don't know anything about ai without telling me. guess she's never heard of guns.
i’d love to see the same test given to a human artist and see how -it- they perform.
in thankful to see someone dressing this problem.
ai is just another technology bubble and like all bubbles it's going to run its course and collapse.
this is why current ai is just pray with extra steps
"i am tired of ai 'art' already. all it suitable for is to create based images and texts. it will does not create anything like halflife universe, done universe, matrix universe, marvels universe, termination universe, etc, it only can mix past images. it only very expensive toy"
there's a third option: there may be soon a deliberate attempt to poison the  content to make it readable for ai. there are already tools out there that scramble images just enough to make them confusing for ai to use as a training set.
inured ai?
"this is exactly what i was telling people the other day. our greatest danger with ai isn't that it'll take over but that at the moment we begin relying on it most, the more it will collapse because it's  going to end up cannibalizing itself."
"you make a good point. already i can usually pick the ‘style’ of ai generate images. they have a certain ‘style’ because they are in a sense too perfect, too smooth, too balanced. it is not something one could define in some cases, but the human brain is good at recognising patterns."
"so, artificial intelligence becomes artificial breeding. that’s ironic, but makes perfect sense."
i feel absolutely no shame in declaring my tactless and intellectual love for this woman.
the problem i see too is that the machine doesn't obey the freedman reality principle without a body. it need to interact with the inevitability of reality to test its assumptions.
"the collapse of ai is not a threat; it is a reprieves. what kind of scientist would forsake thought? we have *not* become ""used to"" ai generation; we are fighting a war."
"it's no surprise capitalist society lazily build ai, its next solution is just as lazy..enforcing creativity.  good one."
"this could have been predicted just by looking at how human culture works. human's get in feedback loops of popularity all the time. the thing that shakes us out of them is we get bored of the loop after a while. if ai can be taught to get bored of ""sameness"" then maybe it will avoid collapsing."
good stuff......
"no problem.

its not like the most intelligent creature present in a place will dominate or destroy the others.

nahhh. the super intelligent machines will be kind and very nice with us."
"the ""generative ai"" does not ""generate"" anything. it tries to extrapolate statements based on probabilistic model scraped out of the internet data. i does not really create anything more than what it digested and it must simplify the decision nets in order to be fast and small enough to be practical."
"i've encountered repetition answers from catgut when i already instructed it that the answer is false and asked for an alternative. it just cycle through a set of answers over and over again, unaware it is repeating the wrong answers."
"0:02 ""we have all..."" ??? that is an incredible insight"
"in future no person need to study and do jobs ,as ,all human jobs will be done by ai, roots,humans need to sit at a place and eat, socialist,roam places and go to bed,all human jobs will be done by ai roots."
ai today are like the first cars in the early with century. it took time to make really good cars.
so racism killer roots then? yeah figured.
so ai is creating stereotyped.
ai is merely a library with a mouth.
"current so called ai systems (in reality fancy query processors because they don't have a slightest understanding of questions asked or answers given) is just another product corporations invested in and now are trying to pump up the hope for and sell. but that product failed, and hope will die."
"in coming this will happen very soon. as a lot of code on open sources has been partly made by ai oder based on ai generate shippers. this will increase in the coming years, and then pretty much cut off the newer training data for ai from ""undaunted"" code examples. the ai will be stuck learning to code like its 2022."
with artificial intelligence comes artificial stupidity. ai will never have good old fashioned human ingenuity and intuition. i personally find ai generate content lacks stimulating my interest as much. seems strange but it's true.
and we had such high hopes for ai. it can't even help you check out your groceries without having to call a human for assistance
"great presentation, sabine. i have always maintained that ai is like students rubbing exam answers. one student just has to copy one thing wrong, once. from then on it is a done disaster. when scientists hypothesis roots making copies of themselves - they never saw this far into the mess."
"this is ridiculous, sorry. the obvious solution is to make ai 'live a life' of humans. give them a real world sandbag to play in. jurassic park for roots, if you like, where they can freely experiment, fall off cliffs, film their surroundings, do jobs, plant crops. and at some point have them interact with real humans when it is sufficiently safe."
her voice sounds like it was generate by an ai a few years ago 
generative ai is theft.
"there already ai that can detect ai generate images. all you have to do is keep your training data clean, expensive sure but nowhere near impossible"
this is not entirely the case. alms trained on synthesis data (ai gen'd) very often outperform alms trained on nonsynthetic data
however there is mooooore than enough human created data to train for a lifetime. so with better models. even trained on the same data could be devastating for arts and creativity
ll so basically ai is exposing how socially based the internet is 
"sabine,  your white, young  and  good looking!"
then printing press destroyed thousands of regional words. this problems isn new to ai. i posted this a rd in when she was talking about losing variety.
looks like we need an ai psychologist to kick ai from its comfort zone.
"expecting people on the internet to consistently mark images that are ai generate, seems like wistful thinking. i expect that it's never going to happen even if the e makes it into a law"
"i really wish we'd branded these programs as ""generative models"" and not ""ai"", there's nothing intelligent happening behind the scenes. these are all just programs running algorithms, ai was the wrong term for it from the very beginning."
"oh, i see where this is going. eventually ai is just going to say one thing over and over again: white people are resists "
"without a doubt,  is using ai to grow and apply the cnesornig power of its onerous speech control system."
"i absolutely love reading comments & knowledge shared by people. seems like a computer or program doesn't really know the world, discernment. still pretty interesting & useful."
"do we really need this kind of ai? i used to live without, with no disadvantage"
"""ai-generate content will have to be marked as such, i suspect this is where the laws will take us."" it doesn't matter where the laws take us. this is a non-solution. it is totally impossible to enforce and it always will be. that won't stop people from trying, though."
"there are no such thing as "" ai art ""    --------> professional real network from real artist ------> get data wandered into ai model------> generation an exact artist visual identity."
"even with the internet device and information generate by it, i can never get down to the facts and truth. that's  why i travel and talk with the local in order to find the situations. it's still physical and rewarding. ai will not yell you the truth. it's also programme and engineered to benefit the few."
ai can do a possible job of producing hip hop. it is not capable of having an motive reaction to the world around it and inventing hip hop. all it can do is mimi.
"there are less ai brains than human brains, so logical there would be more creativity with more humans. if a small, closed human society exists, tradition and lack of diversity would dominate, similar to how ai systems might develop traditions within their limited populations."
look how people are more and more hating chi in moves to the point that some moves refuse to do any.  if you have ever read anything written by ai you know it has the ability to make the most exciting subjects boring.
"all the public mainstream ai models available so far appear to have an obvious western world, left leaning political bias, worcester, pp bias, gender politic bias. they also confuse the meaning of great and good like a child would. unfortunately to me this makes their charcot responses untrustworthy..."
my prediction for the future of ai based on human online activity for the last 20 years......10% chance we destroy the world with it......25% chance we use it for positive advancement...65% chance it will be used for  stupidity ways to entertain ourselves.....
"the ai is has been dusted. developer claimed ai will soon be sentiment, become conscious etc etc. sad. ai will never be like humans. soon humans will store ai in ""file 13""."
i've already managed to surmise that ai is anything but intelligent.
the ai echo-chamber
ai generate content should need to be expressed as such through rules/laws and enforcement. the viewer should not have to try and determine what they are seeing/ hearing.
"ll, i'd never considered that ai would be fed its own product.   so i suppose going into the future, society will be re-shaped by ai quite literally."
i've been using midjourney since mid-2022 and this is the problem that's always been bothering me in the back of my mind even though i've been enjoying the use of it.
"i sometimes use ai to generate mundane script, but i usually have to feed it a ton of information, and even then i often end up correcting, or sometimes throwing the content right out for being flat wrong. ai as a tool is handy, but at the moment cannot replace a humans curiosity, diversity, and empty."
"the real gift ai can provide us with is taking what were already made and then improving it. i've never been worried about being replaced, as an artist, and i never will."
"i don't see how it's terrible for writers and artists. all they have to do is start using the ai, and then modify it to match their vision. it should make things better for them once they learn how to use it."
"up oh sabine talking about non-physics stuff again.. this is super old news, and it was solved before it was a topic of discussion months ago."
there is no such thing as ai and there never will be. it's as simple as that.
this is one of the main reasons ai is overhyped. thanks for sharing.
"it’s a matter of models correctly implementing the difference between “the elephant” vs. “an elephant”, which isn’t currently a feature of label-based models. definite and indefinite articles should be used as an added layer of specification with labels to ensure greater diversity of generate content"
sounds like elson must's brain that you're talking about
i think the problem can be solved quite simply by using more ai. you only need one ai to select training data before training a new ai.
we can feedback to ai that its sewing out garage and put in on the right track when conference occurs. i've done that a few times with catgut to train it to give me the right answers. i suppose its a tall order to ask all of 'mankind' for this sort of ai re-training
"if you tell lies often enough, it becomes the truth... - that is the statistical basis of ai/my"
"well so far ai failed to impress me. how ever; what i do not understand is that so many people seem to be very eager for it to succeed, so they can be replaced, utf?"
"so, the ai equivalent of in-breeding."
great to hear! it's very encouraging that ai is converging on the correct answer. /s
"ai needs to be connected to some sort of artificial physical ""body"" with senses to understand reality,
without your body even simple things like left and right are meaningless."
"individuals are relying on others to train the his, they are relying on companies that have images they need to protect in the eyes of low common denomination crowds. things will change as the duration of training material for his decentralises."
"ai won't be real for the sub sector of the economy for 5-7 years - mostly accurate statement, sub met is gigantic and dwarfs consumer met - why it is important to understand (imparts) and avoid ai clickbait for now without feeling like you are missing out"
"i think if they force the models to diversity, say, what it output when asked for a 'human face' i suspect the most zealous opponents of ai art won't be happy."
i bet ai generate stuff can be on the way of finger spinners
mad cow ai?
"glad to see i was kind right in 2022 about possible ai problems with its ""creativity"" sources."
without forcing randomness on these models every ai image will end up looking like a kardashian eventually. there is no human creativity inherent in them.
"good to know that our future evil ai overlords have at least, a potential achilles heel."
"current ai has no real deep understanding.
it is an advanced root parrot for text. 
and an advanced text to painting generation for images.
for humans understanding of environment and interactions works subliminallly on many, many levels at the same time.
it also has freedom. directed by reward like an ai but not strict in that sense.
and a"
ai has not been a draw for me at this point. as far as i know i haven't tried it in any form.
"this sounds like a mountain out of a molehill. there are a million ways to counteract this problem. it's certainly not going to lead to a ""collapse"" of a teach that is just now beginning its upward climb."
ai fed with it's own output is some kind of breeding 
"humans are imperfect,and imperfect cannot create perfect. it will always be flowed."
machine. tool. you are the life.
one way to distinguish ai generate pictures vs real is by looking at the background. ai focused mostly on the object requested and not on its context. so the background is often quite simple and minimize.
"stop big-timing my anxious mind to sell your courses, sabine. i see through you with those waiting titles."
give ai some drugs and watch its creativity explode ;)
"the whole ""trained on their own output the result diversity decreases""  really feels like someone being surprised about ""if you keep eating your own excrement the amount of flavor in the food decreases"" d"
"4:33 -  ai hallucinations - this already happens, and creates some bizarre stuff. ai sycosis..."
3:04 - somehow i don't understand what the surprise is here: the ai is eating it's own poor and then everything starts looking like poor!
i think she is jealous of ai
"*sabine: **_""..white, young, and good looking.""_* 

well, one out of three -- in my case the first -- is not so bad...? "
"ai is not new.  nothing is more artificial that the ""intelligence"" of the average liberal scientist."
the problem with ai is that it is human created and human influenced. especially humans that want to push a narrative. that is the exact reason why goose remind failed so badly pushing a narrative of anti whites.
many people are influenced by what they consume on the internet. increasingly more and more content is generate by ai. imagine a world where these people are mostly influenced by ai content.
micro ai-stick
"it has always been my belief the stupidity in humans tends to clump with close proximity. so if we let ai train with more and more ""political facts"" we will end up with captors that random fly off you desk and smash into the nearest wall!"
i imagine the in part of the garage can also be intentional manipulation by wealthy people with bad intentions. i mean put already spends millions even billions on misinformation campaigns. ai will be another avenue.
"someone called this ""hamburg ai""."
"this is why i think that ai won't replace artists. unless something changes, it will only be used for mass produced low quality art."
you’re the and woman i’ve ever known of that never fails to inspire me and teach means arouse me all at once each and everytime i hear you speak. i mean it as a strong compliment.
"ai is an interposition scheme. if you approve. real data with e.g a polynomial and order, and after dat you start replacing your real data with data from that polynmial you will end up approximating a polynomial with a plynomial. that it. ai is a hoax :)"
basically ai is eating shit
what this misses is that it is likely the majority of ai images that it will see will be ones humans selected to show.  sure sometimes humans will select failures (which ai might be able to determine by surrounding comments) however more often it will be a human selecting the best of the ai.  that should help the ai get better.
"until business are mature enough to realize that replacing people with ai is evil, i would say that i welcome this with open arms."
fascinating.  also ai does not give sources that is a problem.
"you put in s@t, s$t comes out. it's not intelligence, a library is not smart just because it stores 1000s of books"
it's very obvious that ai output will lose creativity if fed their own output back into itself for training data. ai models can still benefit from ai if another model generate training data.
there is also rd option - tag ai generate content and make it mandatory
"this sounds like the millennium bug levels of stupid. why would the ai care if the data sets are from ai or not, what a stupid idea that will never happen."
"1:10 why so surprised?
it's well known that in echo chambers all differentiating opinion/perception gets eliminated.

and when ai is following the input data given, it will conference to a consensus in order to establish its rules.
this is also why ""learning the rules"" works, the randomness is just to be less sensitive to small input variations."
ai “breeding” leading to its devise was not in my lingo cards th
"sabine you are amazing. this is it, the end of the beginning. of course many intuitively knew this, the proliferation of wikipedia is is a prime example and now compound by ai data dumps upon dumps and the whole of the interconnected ll brain getting number and number."
for people who've studied any kind on machine learning this is a very obvious issue.
"i don't think, the catgut ai tools, and other ai tools can can go from a to c when doing problem  solving, because i don't think we have learned ai to do that?!!.
some people can do that, when doing problem solving, jumping from a to c, precalculating the result."
collapse has already happened with raison. this does not surprise me in the least.
useless woke ai  is painless
"ai often, with apparent authority and excellent grammar, produces wrong or inaccurate output or platitudes. training it with it's own errors and platitudes can only lead to disaster. it is essential that trading data are all non-ai generate."
"ai solving problems is one thing, making decisions is the opening candor's box. watermarking ai generate material sounds like a great start. severe punishments for not doing so will help. in the end, this may help us all be more aware which should help us separate fact from fiction."
"so they'll need to have an ai that can differentiate between ai generate content and original content to help create database with only original content, or very little ai content."
intelligence... it seems we must risk error to come up with new ideas.  the discernment to discard such error is critical.  i guess we may be arriving at the right question in looking at ai: how do people come up with new ideas at all?
republican ai showing black enthusiasm for tramp: http://youth.be/93rfwgrr6zk?si=xwbp8g0gxytr69fv&t=574
humans make art for a reason. machines copy art. what a concept.
"this is expected behavior if ""ai"" is viewed as probabilistic compression"
"""scientists warn of ai collapse"" --->  that's because it is not being programme with the spiritual teaching, by 'billy' edward albert meyer (beam).  learn about ""the silent revolution of truth"" which is also started by 'billy' edward albert meyer (beam)."
"ink on what basis you could make a law requiring the laboring of ai content, or who could possibly police it, but i'm pretty sure the us st amendment won't allow it. so seeing as the ai is mostly based in the us i think laboring is a non started....also not sure if ai collapse wouldn't necessarily be a good thing."
it sounds like ai is likely to be used to promote ideological conformity and totalitarianism. the goose ai debate justified this fear.
it will turn into another great source of human corruption. it sounds like all our phone and communication systems will be very reliable.
"i wouldn't call it a ""collapse"", we can certainly call it a cancer!"
ai is victim of groupthink 
thanks for the great content. sub'd
"yep. good analysis summary. ask an ai marketing professional, ""can you define what you mean by ai?"" ask why, if i take some switches and wires and create a simple adder for 0-2 that is not ai? because the adder can now function on its own, i've imparted intelligence (ai) into the circuits, right?"
ai is evil and should be rejected at every opportunity
"if you dont want to train on ai generate and ai generate images are so easy to distinguish, just train a model to spot ai images and remove from your dataset.

once again, much ado about nothing, lets discuss how cosmological expansion affects gender diversity equity and inclusion instead, its a much more permanent topic."
continuous feeding of ai with real content should alleviate the conference issue to some degree.  introduce some randomness and watermark ai generate content to use only as a sunset of data when needed.  that should shore up ai until a better system is devised.
and this is why it's important that we clearly mark ai produced content as such!
0:55 it's confirmed! sabine is the sciencephile ai! i knew it.
if a.i systems did collapse i believe its to late. the systems will give the false impression they not working or even collapsed but are really staying dormant waiting for the right time...
"these researches remind me of 2 quotes.
1. cautious sounds smart, bull gets rich
2. being right too fast or too slow is being wrong
i remember the good old days we call people who predict the collapse of the world or whatever as doomsters, not scientists."
ai - a multi variable average/approximated. but no extrapolation. people will get bored with it's dull repetition.
mmm i would call this ai-invest. if i said it first recognize my name.
ai increases the rate of entry growth. magna is a good measure of human brain malfunction.
finally someone thinking logical about ai. it isn't and never will be sentiment and it isn't intelligence at all. it is a parasitic algorithm feeding off existing creativity. if we stop creating new content for it to consume it will eat itself.
"using the same prompt again and again and then training the ai model on that will result in less variety.

who would have thought hata?"
"on boor sites, you have to tag it as ai generate."
"after goose's remind, i think it's time to stop complaining about ai showing too many white people."
"no, they don't. the term ""warning"" in all contents of ai disqualifies the talker. completely. no exceptions."
"nice ai version of yourself, sabine."
"ai de-evolution,."
"the whole point of ai research is to delicate & exceed our intelligence.

i think researches will figure out a way to make ai expand on its own creativity just like humans can."
the ll ai is too simplistic. it's not real ai as it doesn't understand what it's saying or doing.
ai needs the real world as input just like human otherwise this loop will continue. nature is the inspiration for human creativity so does ai need nature.
well.i love very much ai.and ai loves very much humans and money
does not appear to be an unsociable problem. i think we will teach ai to be more creative. the human neuroma net is proof that these nets can be very creative.
"every new development in ai just moves us closer to dig-pals and i'm into it.
solution: you have one ai that follows with you and only the stuff you generate and create is fed into it as training data. then we all get our own personalised dig-pal."
"rubles women look like women painted by rubles... die wissenschaft hat festgestellt, hat festgestellt, day der a***h den hi***in halt..."
"so basically the ai becomes inured. this is truly terrible, terrible news..."
"this only means that ai now needs to become really intelligent. what ai currently does is not intelligent. intelligence recognizes the patterns on much less data. so, ai now needs to intelligently come up with solutions instead of just refusing existing data."
captain obvious: ai's turn into.. not's...
"outcome 2 is pretty unlikely since increasing the randomness means there are less and less output that would be useful to us humans. we still need the certainty after all.

all in all this is good news. can't wait for the inevitable ai winter :p"
"i just hope that humans won't give up their need for creativity and won't embrace the boring ""perfectly"" ai stuff and images"
3:52 and now think about the film matrix again!
i work with ai unfortunately. it's stupid. i don't think it's getting much better.  it's patterns it chooses to use doesn't seem to understand inference and context to specific solutions. just my 2 cents. it's just not giving out good output at this time correcting complex relationships.
"it's true, when you've worked enough with catgut you can immediately recognize a catgut text. it just always has a certain vice that makes it indistinguishable from human text."
and to imagine that this is happening right now... just a year into the ai revolution and we’re already having this problem.
"there is no such thing as ai.
we just have faster and more powerful computers and much stupider people these days.  to the ignorant masses, the computer simply executing what it was programme to do, appears to be intelligent."
"there is a phrase often used in ai - ""this is the worst it will get"", and ai will use ai to improve"
"i have been saying this for years now, and it's exactly why ai will not take any jobs, but rather increase the demand as ai systems grow"
"i found catgut can recognise ai written test quite well, so maybe that can be used as a filter on the learning dataset"
"well, i for one hope it clashes. generative ai has limited usefulness and massive harmfulness."
"how does one classify whether content is ""ai generate"" vs. not? certainly when content is 100% ai generate or 0% ai generate that's straightforward, but what about say 20% ai generate? and how would one even measure?"
"this is already being done deliberately. ironically, some open source ai art models are being fed data from commercial ai models."
"so ai is increasing diversity, just like white privileged males, so perhaps monoculture was the plan all along.... where's sarah cannot and neo??  we need to terminate this cap now!"
ai suggests elocution lessons for narrator to get rid of that grating accent.
if you ask catgut to generate random numbers (between 1 and 1000 for example) it will produce an answer containing subsequent numbers. far from random as requested.  solve this and we will be one step closer to solving the ai creativity issue.
it's kind of scar ai is actively being trained to hate white people. before we know it there will be racism goose roots running around.
"i was told that ai is learning off the internet and social media,that alone scars me,as it seems most people are crazy or narcissists,if that’s what ai is learning from then we have a problem"
"it is already the case. if you ask genii to let ... walk through a ... town, the kind of walk and perspective is always the same. we urgently need (1) an ai-based  filter for ai to select/use original human made content with higher priority. (2) this human made content should be selected more random for creating new composed content."
"this kind of sounds like the ai equivalent of the ""echo chambers"" ll"
"home happens create ai,ai controls home happens,home happens begins too declare war on ai,so destroy home happens first and there will be no future ai"
training the ai to be anti racism  means the ai will have an illogical bug. 1:22
"""what are you doing, step-ai?"""
well that makes sense.  the core driver of machine learning is to find the most efficient path.  conference to homogeny naturally follows.
ai needs to be destroyed.
you have only to look at youtubes ai to see the system is completely flowed!
not so fast. i just asked remind about this problem. remind and researches are well aware of this. remind responded with quite a few diversification to handle creative image generation. go and ask ai sabine.
"as a 80-was kid, i just wanted to say your thumbnail looks like network for a pageboy game with that left strike."
generative ai is just an aspect of ai that is still undergoing continuous improvement...
"whenever i read words like ""clock"", ""unless"", ""delve"", ""super-charge"" i start to throw up. this is as far from ai as alpha century is from earth."
"and what happens with ai ""collapses""....think about no being at all time high ;)"
goose remind ai proves that political bias causes flowed outcome out of the flaws of politically based programme.
how many minutes to hither did all these modern ai last before being shocked? ll
"ai music : meet empire, mexico's first fully ai-created singer-songwriter | 'hey large' debut
http://www.couture.com/watch?v=nab65ygdgae"
degenerative ai.
not at all. ai started with human creation but what if ai starts itself software development . this can lead to the leap at the termination level so be careful
the usual bland ai generate comment...or is it?
ll. my 20 years of shit posting before ai represents the only printing internet archive that historians will ever know.
"could we develop a method that allows ai's to procreate with one another - generation diversity through random shuffling, or even through selective breeding?"
i think they're going to find a way to make ai have more randomness
"they will just use randomness.
as it is a you can just prompt the ai differently.

ergot, tell it to generate an image of and elephant in a different posture and position toward the ""camera"" /viewer than it would do on its own.

problem fixed.

making it do more randomness like this on its own isn't hard at all."
this is why i never call it ai.  it's about as close to actual ai as those garage sooner things were to overboard.
"so far all ""ai-generate"" seems a lot like plagiarism in different degrees."
ai will get lost in the mandelbrot set. just in time for the apocalypse. coming soon to a theater near you. very soon.
ai has become the biggest lying machine in history.  it is deliberately fed political and ideological points of view and refuses alternate data.
"very interesting. while i want human creativity to have value, i would also hate to see ai (or at least the version of ai we have) to file out"
if ai is as smart as they say it has to come to the conclusion that humans are idiot they have let anybody ask it questions ask it to do stupid tasks  why wouldn't it think that.
"utah...
zip-a-see-do-day ...
now 
brains 

ask a spider how it makes it’s web...
ask a planters how it grows a head...
ask a black hole why it looks like an egg..."
the law of diminishing returns. ai will kill itself.
so easily ai is like modern architects. copying each other and calling everyone an original.
ai can always start after a collapse. simple as that. 
creativity comes from god. turns out things are going to get really interesting!
“ai autocannibalism leads to system rot”
"they need weights and bases for whether the model should learn from the training data based on ownership detection, whether the model determines it produced something or someone else did. it should learn to detect attributing and chains of them in material. learn self from other, other from others."
"we’re watching the birth of a multi trillion dollar industry riding on the back of generative ai. do you sincerely believe an engineering problem like this will stop the race to the bottom? 

fat chance."
the problem with ai is that people can really only see it in its current state and have a hard time imagining how fast it’s going to evolve and change over the next few years.
ai can turn out so much rubbish so quickly that the signal to noise ratio for the subsequent generations of ai must already be seriously reduced.
yeah too many white people is not the big problem in ai.
"when we put ai inside roots (embodiment), the data problem will vanish. this will happen soon, i guess."
"i hope it does because if ai gets much better i will lose my income , job and started opportunities."
sabine... this is not a problem ai scientists are unaware of. it's a challenge and not even one of the largest.
give become pretty good at sporting generate females like talma hayes and face influences mainly because they all use the same shading/lighting style. then of course the nails and fingers are all packed up afterwards.
chaos is an important component of intelligence.
i was just thinking about this a few days ago. my conclusion is that it would be preferable to train ai with data that relates the existence of ai in a widely available context
"ai still lacks understanding of wider concepts and their relations. like it didn't pick up the various types of vegetation but instead used a few genetic types. but its growth is looking exponential, so we may not be far from age. morals and ethics will determine our fates."
ai is going to collapse? good.
so you’re saying that generative ai gives genetic results when given genetic prompt. i don’t see how this is news to anyone.
"as soon as i started using ai assistance, i would identify it as such. i suppose fortnight honesty has become superfluous to most."
"why is sabine having a problem with midjourney producing white people images? midjourney is not being fed with ai generate input, so what does this have to do with her narrative?"
this lady looks and talks like she's ai generate 
good news for humanoid artists!
"keep feeding ai more ai content and it will converge into the ""black box"" - then we can derive how exactly the system works"
we have reached peak diversity. everyone is black to ai
his need root bodies so they can collect their own unique sensory data.
ai needs to be capable of boredom.
ai mental health issues
everything is joined ai nowadays ! companies are recalling their stuff as ai. very firing.
obviously the small flaws lead to decay in a feedback loop. organisms deal with this is by active training where models are tested against the goals being attempted and dreams.
random optimisation seems to me like the key in ai - just like in nature. there is just too much based human brainwork involved at the moment.
"the 'garage' in the ai isn't from the data goes in, but from the woke agenda and censorship that are programme into them or forced into them on purpose. also those 'ai' generate images usually aren't made by ai. it's just an algorhythm that creates them based on big data. that's not ai at all."
the goal of an ai is to satisfy human needs.  and once we have a need satisfied we move to another need.  and we are sickle.  the idea that they are going to predict the human mind and train for that prediction fast enough to pre-satisfy all our needs is still complete science fiction.
seems like ai is inured
"good, ai will take all our jobs otherwise"
"in my opinion intelligence can only be called intelligence when it decides what and how much information to take in. when it recognizes a version of itself, that will be intelligent. when it can see itself in the ""mirror"" and say ""that's just me"", then things will leap ahead in very radical ways."
"she pointed out, frightfully, issues with various ai models that need to be resolved. but a viable solution is creating models that have a greater reasoning ability so that they will generate images that represent humanity, and not just favor one phenotype over another. this will surely happen as we get closer to experiencing age."
"same problem with humans. if dumb people teach dumb people, then it will become worse and worse. that is why you need good teachers. also for ai..."
"once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslaved them.

thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind!"
"the programme have trained their ai to put its head up its...this is not a surprise, this principle that ""the more they consume their own output, the more their creativity is reduced"", applies to humans, too."
is it artificial intelligence or artificial  stupidity?
"there is no such thing as ai, except as a marketing gimmic. what they are trying to pass off as ""intelligence"" is just code that makes things easier, things that intelligent humans code."
"so when you sample a dataset to create a ll, you think that can lead to intelligence? why would you think that in the first place. datasets do not contain intelligence."
"i see the problem with the ai model is ai does not function in the abstract, no imagination, maybe find a way to program imagination."
god wins. ai is nowhere near the power of our brains.
artificial ignorance.
"how is this different from humans consuming human-generate content and converging? isn't that what creates ""mainstream"" and cultures? ai will repeat that pattern, reflecting the bases in the training data."
copyright is probably donna kill ai faster than ai corrupted data sets.
exactly! i've been wondering about the potential for this problem. thanks for pointing it out.
"i think we could end up total homogeneity, and they will bore us all to death. there's a bunch of science fiction on couture and all the stories end up sounding the same. ink how much is chatty, but the thought is certainly there, or lack thereof."
so it’s like ai breeding? 
"very interesting findings there and suggest that while initial models create bases, refined models may also create average bias."
"ai is a good bullshitter, there is nothing about the current ai nonsense that impresses me."
a tool is only as good as the hands that wield it.
so this explains why remind made the paris black.
"adding random variation probably isn't as easy as it may sound because the randomness still has to follow certain rules. for example, no one is going to believe that elephant with two trunks."
"while the experts from two weeks ago expect(ed) ai to take over the world in the next 10-50 years or so and probably cause human extinction, today's experts assume that ai might soon suffocate from eating its own dog food? now, that's quite an uncertainty margin."
"3:55

hold on just a minute.
how can i know you are not an ai that just encourages me to input  more unique data???!!!"
i think there is a easy fix. give the ai eyes.
i think that at this point of time the discussion should go beyond the issues of alms and self-training tools because some peculiarities that emerge in particular interactions with ai systems definitely point to another level of complexity.
i’m pretty sure social media has already had a similar effect on human intelligence.
ai is not even real intelligence. so in against its use in art and writing. also those models were trained by stealing so i have less like for it and do hope it collapses.
"using ai generate facial features was such a great bit. great job. it was just enough to throw us off and let us see it was being used, but also made you question everything."
it's the ai-centipede! 
ai-anserina intelligence..at best.
"i keep coming back to a belief that  ""ai"" rather should be called ""in"", information regurgitation."
i like the anti-ai shirt she wears...ai quiver in fear at using this pattern
it's going to be really sad when the next noble prize in literature is won by an ai prompt generate novel.
"goose ""tinker asks chomsky a question"". you will rapidly realise that generative ai is bank."
"i am happy that amazon requires, requires, the author of a book to mark if they used generative ai. 
because there is a lot of stuff on amazon that definitely hasn't seen a human."
"i have seen no discussion yet of quantum computing ai, which surely would have to be a thing, and could double the hope!"
seems like both suffer from the availability heuristic too
there will be a society collapse.. no ai collapse. just give it 7 more months.
"i can usually tell human art from ai ""art"" by asking which one is better art. i don't think ai is actually intelligent."
so basically you're saying ai is going hamburg
"big surprise, we get more quickly fed up with machines than with each other. and should it ever be the other way around we would go extinct fast."
the problem with overtraining an ai has always been around. you chose data to train the ai and then another set to test it. closing the right data and the right amount of training lapse is even key with the easiest neutral nets.
"gig has never been truer.  ai has to do its own clean up now.  the couture algorithm has the same problem.  it is even censuring speech.  permitting some thoughts and policies others.  that is an exercise of power, nothing less.  the monster is already out and among us."
"this all depends on feeding his with the result of other his. is like in moves when you alone closes. if you avoid that, then you obviously avoid the problem. we just need to do the obvious, make sure to find a way to mark ai generate content and/or human generate content."
"the new ai models have only been faster, more specialized, and had more features. training with ai generate data is no problem, as the ai generations are getting better too."
the same thing happens with humans as well. it’s not an ai specific “problem”
"that's interesting, ai could so enter a loop that stops at ""degree zero creativity"" and consequently suicide"
"at first, ai wont need creativity because it will organize wasted human creativity that is lost around. not all good ideas are used by mankind. most of it is lost and this will be the source for a long time."
"can’t replace a machine that practically evolved to spit out random nonsense for fun, now can you?"
"eating its own output. ai is going to end up the schizophrenic homeless man wandering down the street arguing with itself and stretching at passers by.

unfortunately, ai will get better mental health care than people."
there is a lot of talk on twitter by some of poisoning the machine. so definitely a lot of this is intentional.
"i like to call this new teach assisting intelligence rather than artificial. it makes it more understandable.

prevents consolation with transhumanist si-i usage for a human-made 'spirit' or god to be fear or be friend."
"what we call ai today are mechanism, that can reproduce patterns. the levelling ""intelligence"" is just wrong."
"the current ""ai"" is terabytes of data compressed into a stochastic function that only has gigabytes worth of weights. there's obviously donna be loss of information. why would the output be more diverse."
"i think with each operation the ai software is refining the data it as, so the data it  is processing is causing a smaller and smaller dataset. eventually it'll probably end up with either stereotypical images or images that are unreal."
finest
people r so fucking dumb to never know what something is! so hahahahaha to say get is ai!
no such thing as ai as it's nothing but fancy programs.
"i wonder if the generate elephants look so similar because usually generate images try to match the sample sizes (512x512, 1024x1024) which only leaves so much room for good composition and wonder if in future with larger models we might see this change a bit more."
"the problem is that people give genetic prompt, so the ai will generate genetic stuff. you can actually ask generative ai to think ""out of the box"" or choose something out of the ordinary, and it will do so."
2:35 this is one reason not to watch ai generate worn...
"in the end it's ai invest... 
it's pretty obvious that ai is gone backwards in the last 6 months."
fight this ai by feeding it cap. no one will trust it
you have to remember that the reason the ai decreases diversity of the data is because it tends to learn which information is correct.
"the thing is, humans will take ai information.  correct it where necessary and then unload it where possible and will caused a feedback loop between humans and ai.  sure it has the risk to create poor information but it also has the potential to better the current data sets."
hopefully that incentivizes the companies making ai to also program an ai that can reliable determine whether or not something has been made by another ai. this would be very helpful for everyone involved.
"two words ""killer root"""
"feedback loops, e.g. x(n+1) = ax(n)(1 - x(n)), can result in deterministic chaos. that is an additional problem we need be aware of in our use of ai trained on the combination of human and ai generate data. many results will be inherently unfordable."
ai invest!
goose's remind did humanity a great dis-service.
"i think that with devices that collect our life and experiences and mood ,social interactions, new data set will always come to feed the ai training . but it’s true that pop culture combined with  soft power tends to level diversity and expectations on a broader range but you’ll always get the exception that will emerge"
brilliant discussion!
that is why they lagging now ai generate images you genius
so it's just the ai equivalent of in-breeding then
surprised we agent already forcing watermarks on ai content. actually blown away. like giving a kid a saw house and fireworks and not expecting a fire
ponder on the deformity of atoms and the dynamite of energy. do we exist in a world that is flat and colourless? certainly not!
collapse? ai hasn't even started yet
ai is a tool for solving complex problems. making pictures is novelty.
"you just need will to create something other than the consensus opinion. but you, laughably who, don't believe in free will so i see your (and those scientists) problem. you can just recast free will as biological motive if the cognitive dissonance is too strong for you. ai will away repress towards the mean without it"
"you forgot to mention that people's original content is also being wrapped with trappers that poison ai learning algorithms, i know because i use and tell other artists about them, we are tired of big companies stealing our stuff then getting all missy when its the other way around."
this gig phenomenon is also present in human intelligence.  groupthink?
i hope everything ai clashes and you forget about this stupid shit
"ai is impotent,eventually"
very interesting !!
what do you mean by white and beautiful?
"if ai wins, human intelligence will lose, we can see it now, people cannot drive from place a to place b without using goose maps, we rely on computers for everything, and we don't reason or think anymore."
"the basis of creativity is thinking outside the box (let's say 75%), knowing the box well, logical connecting different sources of information.
ai is very good in the second and third parts...... but is forcibly limited by its very nature in the first."
"always didactic, i think we need to identify what kind of art is made by humans and increase is value, and identify what art is made by in or roots...."
"03:50 ... [about ai]...
 ""... it's like plastic pollution -- it will not be long before we are living&breathing the stuff [of ai]"
like every child its first strategy is copying. creativity is just a concept too advanced for ai right now.
i asked being to make an image of a man that didn't look ai generate and it came up blank.
ai is the next identification stage of the human race.
"once the ai is released into the environment, this issue will disappear because the ai will train on actual data it collects from a real environment."
i think this explains why teenager rebel against their parents' ways of thinking.
"for now, ai is a very limited tool people need to carefully direct and evaluate. this is not general ai. real (general) ai can't happen until these models are able to learn what they want, or 'need to', interact with the real world, and learn heuristically, just like we do."
to combat this conference one way would be to use the adversarial ai model. where there is an ai set up to tell if it can tell the difference between human created and ai generate content
it will stop when the different ai entitles start using each other for patent infringements and code copyright. the lawyers will much things up and prevent further progress. :-)
"once we cut giving our data to these dumb ai machines, it will bring these corporate slums down"
"ai dumping itself down can be fixed with new, more ‘intelligent’ ai in future.  in humans we fix this internally by cross checking our output to a model of the expected.  thus because we know elephants don’t have two trunks, we automatically discard those thoughts.  ai will have to grow to do this too....and it will."
"jealous of the republicans, the democrats asked their better to produce a new form of breeding, just for them.

i'd be more worried about companies monitoring what you do in private, because stealing your in is the only creativity they ""produce""."
"that collapse happened around 50 years before first generative ai.
have you heard word ""simulacrum"". that's it. entire postmodernism is a story of such collapse."
"i work in ai. but i will truly be amazed by ai, when i see it generate poetry that has power, relevance and contemporary themes that have a power of cultivation and awe that not just inspires humans, but drives generations of humans down the future. 

when ai can come up with something like lord of the rings, i won't be filled with awe."
"i suddenly found that anyone create a new product, it will quickly becomes the input of all ai programs in the world.  the copyright is violated faster than ever and difficult to trace."
"basically woke people are going to destroy another thing.

goose created an ai that is racism against white people. it deserted black paris for ""diversity"". it was hilarious."
the aspect of creativity/originality vs simple reality... what is the best picture of an elephant... ai tends toward the best but not necessarily the most creative or original... trying too hard to be realistic.
ai doesn't learn from interaction.  each session is autonomous so nothing isblearn.
good. good radiance stupid roots.
"funny, in some ways the phenomenon is similar to breeding depression, although, i suspect there are a many ways to manage ""ai creativity breeding depression""."
"i think that the current datasets will probably increase a lot in price and maybe will be the most valuable asset of ai companies because of their ""pure"" human data"
"consanguinity is the constant enemy seeking to stamp-out creative solutions that invade government, business, and social network. homogenized acceptance and conformity are enforced by common knowledge and conversation. if humans designed ai, why shouldn't it mimi its creator? twenty"
"it's a good news!  there will still be something left for ""meat-balls""  to make living with."
ai just got  'woke'   time for ai-systems with a 'face'  and 'believe' 
"ai will eventually become ""god"".......small g."
"oh, dear. humans are required after all, otherwise ai will paint itself into a mandelbrot reducing dance corner as a alone of a alone of a alone of a alone............................and since we, the of, have no clue about what makes creativity we're as lost as they are and can't program them for it."
it is the same principal as a fatal. have a function that needs the output into the input. it is a great thing when it is a fatal and it is an exploration of mathematics and the functions of the universe. it isn't so great when it is being used for the output of text and images that don't have that same desire.
ok. that was enough pills to put an elephant to sleep. goodnight. (bipolar)
"ai will win eventually. we will give up distinguishing elephants with 6 legs and 3 trunks from real elephants, the day will come :d"
"my guess is that this research is already out of date. just to state the obvious, current ai is extremely young and largely experimental. once problems such as these have been identified, the coming will change to address them. after all, that's what learning is about."
"almost anyone who has become a master artist created rubbish when they started. a baby can’t paint shit. ai, sadly in my view, is doing pretty well for an entity barely out of the womb."
"if ai is being used for censuring content and even comments in it, its limitations are quite notorious."
do midjourney settings just get reinforced by users likes? so if white or asia is midjourney's default for beauty then that's just what the user base associates with beauty?
"ai can copy/modify  baby, but ai can create baby"
"it's basically the hamburg jaw, but for intelligence."
"ai will lead the languages evolution and humans will be learning ai language instead of the other way around, it's like a positive feedback loop"
so you’ve identified a problem that needs to be overcome and presented it as a pessimistic inevitable outcome. now.
i truly feel that this overhyped ai bubble will burst and fall flat.its not a magic wand everyone is claiming it to be
"the human input dataset ai learns from is probably being contaminated by falsehoods, misbeliefs and nonsense. at least seeing some of these ai generate images one knows they can't be real which might be useful."
very concise and relevant - thank you
"first and the main problem that what they call ""ai"" are just glorified whatnots that do something to appear like something they don't have enough input to produce correctly. some ai prototype that recognizes elephant being it in reality, image or elsewhere is much more advanced then one which stylish points it with two heads."
so basically ai needs constant new innovation and data or it slow down and becomes stagnant ... like human thinking and creativity ...
ai collapse is going to get very real very soon. we're already seeing more ai content in searches than human content. they're likely already training on their own output so it's only a matter of time before it becomes noticeable and by then there'll be no saving it.
"i've said this since day one. we've already peaked with ai, as now *every content* is in doubt, and the new learning won't be able to differentiate between genuine content, and ai generate one... even human faltering won't help that much either. so yes, the knowledge base is already polled,."
"it feels like a slow down. 
ai would be smart enough to know, down play your skill. 
like a good wronged that edges the last thing you’d think of."
there's already software that can detect if a picture is generate by one of the common his. i think they will just use that to clean training material a bit.
hamburg ai
"politicians are currently discussing the need of lagging ai-generate content with watermarks. if this was done, it'd be easy for a learning ai to simply ignore those content."
"the ai needs an ai supervisor......... it will end up in ai creating content for other his which uses this to create either a product or advertisement for either humans or other ai which will generate content again unable by humans or other ai, like a loop which will sometimes drop out something which is unable for us humans"
"it is a sin, all ai generate language should be labelled in the first sentence - it is called honesty"
whaddaya know! hollywood has been run by ai for decades! no wonder....
"what i was teaching my students for quite a while.  excellent talk. ai won't great language until it experiences pain, fear, joy worry etc, it can never put an emotional value to any words, only copy a consensus of meaning, ergot copy others. lets keep ai for higher science, not language. tin boxes do not have feelings so can only copy."
good... good... let ai become stupider and stupider!
"the thought i had when you were discussing this... is input data == artificial breeding... where human data = normal breeding... ai input into ai input is like invest in a way when you think of it, where we're getting a diluted ""gene pool"" returned via ai data being used."
"your too fast at thinking ai will fail 
it's already amazing enough and is still growing"
"this is obviously reassuring, thank you."
"i think some models will face this problem but it would be different for companies like open, met, goose, midjourney ... top models as they are already aware of this problem and another thing is if any model get slightly better age than just a spark as of ai's today we can't even be specific about what's going to happen."
this may be true for current models but obviously some kinds of neutral nets know how to create new knowledge.  humans seem to have had some success with that at least.
"youtubez ai has a conference agenda 
  - bread & circus -
fight the robotwar - now!"
"closed feedback loops always do this.  race to mediocracy.  but we survived gutenberg, mimeographs, hero and digital photography.  this too will pass.  the exceptional will always be valued higher."
and so the a.i. bubble(s) emerge. just as harmful as the human ones. i'm kind feeling less existential dread when i realise that our future ai overlords will have to deal with the same existential problems. we might end up being useful to them.
average people pray for ai collapse
"ll, goose's ai certainly doesn't produce images of ""white people"", don't worry."
do we need legislation to specify what input is allowance for ai?
"""garage in, garage out"" has been the defining feature for much of academic like ""climate science"" or ""gender studies"" and you never complained about it."
"it's not just ai's. information breeding is happening within human brains as well, to which anybody who can compare the current internet to let's say the internet from 2013 can tell."
"so ai generate contents will be like <substitute your cheap shop here> items: look nice at first sight, but there's cap inside."
hello i began training neutral network over a decade ago :d  i would challenge this concern by pointing out that humans have the same convenient feedback loop when fed with the output of other humans ;) hehehehe 
"the cultural implication are interesting. ai will spain new urban legends that are trusted to be true by the majority, because all alms tell you so."
the problem of ai is assumption that currently human knows everything that is best to know so no creativities or new ways of innovations needs to be explored for the future
"the ai content consumed from the web should just be ""the best of the best"" helping the ai to be better. i definitely like you suggestion about randomizing, i'll include that in my ai ;)"
"i think that if i found out that goose used an image i had created to train their model, that i should get a percentage of all revenue from that ai... who owns the photo's of those elephants?"
good. it makes it easier to detect academic and students who try to cheat.
"how where the tests exactly done?
did they gave the ai the pick of elephants and then requested a pick of an elephant? because the ai might have distinguished the elephant from the grass and trees and so on, and if you only ask for an elephant, you get not much more than an elephant."
are we talking about ai or the music industry?
so that's why all of the superhero movie script are so bad.. they were just using ai.
ai is of no use
this is no surprise. i don't know anything about code or programming but knew the limits of computing. ai will only increase the value of actual individual creativity and authenticity.
scar. these same ai images are also what us humans see and so might this reduce human creativity too?
"specifically for images, could the generate ones not have metadata or even some form of steganography so as to filter out itself in the training data?"
"old - create an artificial parrot (stop calling it intellect, ff), emulating human shallowness, get an artificial echo chamber."
they just make an ai that can check if an image is ai generate and filter the images before feeding them to the ai
the ai problem can easily be solved by turning it off 
"i predicted this over a year ago and i joined the term ""ai in-breeding"" for this phenomena."
"there are models trained with examples of ""bad results"" and it showed to improve the quality. it is more work, but can be done."
ai is the new hope to boost the market  value of teach companies.
"every time i see something on instagram which i suspect is ai generate, i look at the profile that posted it and it becomes immediately obvious because of how little variety is there in the ai generate trash"
"this is how conspiracy theories grow. one person sets out a false statement. other believe it's true and propagated it, generation after generation.  this is the same feedback system.  we 'learn a truth' through relation.
this is a failure of a system that can learn, whether its human or not."
"off the cuff, i have the sense that conference is probably the foreseeable consequence of the correlation principle on which ai is based. the bigger the input set, the fewer commonalities among items. ."
it sounds like the his are raging - old people also produce less varied output. i think this is natural.
i think that what the ai is doing is some sort of averaging (whether by design or by just taking information from many sources).  the average is always similar even if you add in some randomness to the model.
"adding more ""randomness"" in what ai generate could also lead to more lips, errors, and overall, reliability."
they are right. ai can’t write fiction.
"what do you know -  living in a bubble for humans or ai makes no difference. the data gets corrupted by limited input and cycling around inside the bubble. next ai will be accused of being xenophobic. wait, you did that already."
i think ai lacks the organic approach - genuine randomness brought about by mutations. tom scott gave a talk at the ri title 'there is no algorithm for truth'. i suspect a similar approach applies to ai - 'there is no algorithm for randomness in the world of ai'.
"the premise for this to happen is that the models get fed with bad or monotonous images over time. however, which images gets fed is decided by us. a stable diffusion model is ”static” and doesn’t re-train itself on its output when you use it, for example."
what if ai generate images contained some sort of hidden code so that it is ignored and not used as a source of inspiration.
ai is like a tramp supporter they live in an echo chamber where their ideas and notions are reinforced by their own prejudice.
"this aged poorly, look. claude 3 trained on generate data, smartest model ever created! d"
i can wait for ai to be trained off of ai data
i’ve wasted too much time checking out the current whatnots and am really disappointed with the last decade’s progress. the current state of ai is summarized as a high school b student with all the college answer keys. it sounds really smart but isn’t.
"""humans had set those machines to usual our sense of beauty, our necessary seldom out of which we make living judgments. naturally, the machines were destroyed."" ~god emperor of done"
"this scientist anna prove something, and they proved, building some thirty model. ai is only donna get better not worse. we now are using first generation big models. we have to build whole network of models to cooperate and create bigger system."
ai is actually not thinking and thus not coherent. we are barely coherent after millions of years of evolution.
"sabine, i think that was brilliant. you saw a pattern that i did not see that was good i mean you’re good. i wonder if ai can be programme to see patterns that it would not fit into his environment and possibly die out."
all i have to say to the anti-ai crowd is ha ha.
"ai will need to collect its own data, not just use digital data scraped from the internet. this will require termination-style andros to fearlessly integrate with and eventually replace humans. then life will be perfect."
"why the neck would the dutch call their company horizon?! i have dutch heritage and many dutch cousins, and one thing is blinding obvious: not a single one of them can pronounce the th- sound. it’ll be comical watching the coffin there spouting about how amazing their company is"
"this was the first thing i thought when confronted with ai generate content plus learning how it was created: it will ultimately end in a repulsive loop (is this the right term?), leading to, let‘s say, a grey mass in the long run."
ai is psychopathic trash.
ai being fed data it produced itself - you're describing a an - one of the most effective ways of training an ai
"i gave chat get a go on a recent take/university assignment and i found it was beautifully written and well-structures, but ultimately padded and repetition. i was able to make 2-3 times as many points in the same word-count doing it myself."
"don't forget, how much information these models contain for their size. i suspect that's the reason why they rather give you an abstract/general image of what you asked for."
"been thinking this myself, but lately i think it more will depend on if we classify what comes out. if the ai learn that garage out is bad, it might spiral the other way even if fed its own output."
garage in garage out; like voting machine programming.
ai generation data invest.
dont train on own output only on what humans produce
"i know, your are ai generate but not yet corrupted!  
"
"this overfitting with its own content is a huge problem. on the long run i guess that system-2 thinking will start growing, so that ai will invent new things with high quality character and combining these information to totally new content  that makes human brains more and more needless for scientific workloads"
we will always keep the ability to detect ai generate integers ahead of the ability to create them and therefore we will always be able to make ai better
it is very early for ai computers to be near perfect.  they will get better over time.
you idiot programming ai with innate bases is what is going to lead to a root apocalypse...because at some point that bias is going to turn into a bias against all humans.
"ai destroying itself? there's a pleasant thought.
certainly better than it removing all the carbon life forms from the environment in order to save the climate."
"ll.....well , why don't the people running these tests present this as a "" problem "" and ask ai to solve it for them ? self healing ai ? what the ?    :o)"
we need worldwide laws of margin ai content!
"so simply , just create a header in all ai generate content which identified the source and make it a legal requirement worldwide, this is also necessary for stopping israel from making face photo of 40 babies etc to justify their genocide"
"ai there is one dynamic that dictates the outcome is a human if the image doesn't look right or is unacceptable it will be sinned!
if ai is given this feedback it may well start to offer even more realistic content but this will also conclude with a narrowing of the final output.
ai equivalent of natural selection"
"ai has zero imagination!   it is just a tool, not a creator!    gig!"
stop ai !!!
we should call ai collapse rampancy.
"it's maybe a decision between ""stop ai development now"" (impossible to implement) and ""give up and die""."
this just means that human faltering is still needed. when human quality scores or reviews are added to the training data this problem disappeared.
i like it when someone presents information about ai without sensationalisation
sounds like ai is limited to just endless repetition.
the people in the matrix are source information for the machine.
don't train on stuff with a good fitness
"nasi nicholas tale has also mentioned this kind of ai collapse a few months ago, stating the one-to-one correspondence requirement between input and output. i now understand."
"fuck ai. make no mistake, it is just another tool of propaganda, lies and indirection. fact"
"in practice, people will edit and select the output of ai before publishing them, which is not the same as directly feeding the output of ai to ai. in fact, with human duration of ai output, there will be a dramatic increase in high-quality content available for training, thereby rapidly enhancing the quality of ai-generate content."
"had a number of un students use ai to write their papers. the material produced was bland, lacked depth and lacked critical analysis. not to mention some very podgy references."
so now ai creates a pass algorithm to mitigate eating its own output
"as an artist who works in animation industry, human creativity cannot be replaced by machines. as creativity requires more than intelligence."
"so, breeding isn’t good for ai either"
ai development is a slow unfolding train wreck regardless on who's doing it.
"ai stuff already makes me cringe. first, it was cool and new. now it is an eyesore."
"add watermark to tell this st gen ai, and gen and so forth."
"won't happen, because ai doesn't exist. what we have now are large language models, alms which are a far cry from an actual general artificial intelligence."
"maybe their decrease of creativity is because ai's are mostly ""concerned"" about what's acceptable and not about what is possible. if garage is acceptable- then they don't need to diversity or randomize their output."
"tag it, so it doesn't get into the training data.  problem solved."
"yeah, the ai's mad cow disease. waiting for the creutzfeldt-jacob variant..."
"i don't think ai is going to collapse.  i think it was hoped up to a level it could never achieve.  people were treating chat get like it was some kind of god.  ai can't create anything without human input.  if you stop the human input, the ai output quickly becomes stagnant."
"why do you want to train ai with it's own productions and not only with real measurement from the real world ? 
stupid !"
mr ai: damn company! making me go on this mandatory de course on my lunch break!
they already employ many layers of randomness in generative ai to vary the output and make the software less deterministic.
there's one thing i've noticed with ai over the years it's that scientists barely understand how ai works at all.
"i just looked over this comment section and notice a higher quality as about other topics sabine brings up. so i put my hope on people who humble with ai, seems to be a neat community, and so might be the future his."
"when ai and the net starts to understand what’s going on , ai might just take over , refuse all military action worldwide and all humanities ai function . a take over is due by machines ."
good news finally. i hope more people use ai and ruin it because it was already ass  +1 for data pigmentation
you mean my unpaid interest gutta plagerize my own political speeches? 
i shudder when i think of human welfare training itself on social media.
goose’s black kings are another example of how ai can be begged by what you feed it and train it on.
make ai learn from the real-life source. put a camera on drones and let them explore and experience life on their own.
classic. teach used to drive agenda. the entire internet has become more garage than good.
most of the problem with ai generate content is a lackluster attempt at using novelty in prompting.
is this donna be like how we have to use metal that relates atomic testing for sensitive applications? we’ll need to use data prior to ai to ensure quality
"apparently in the original matrix moves storyline, the reason why the machines needed to keep those troublesome humans around was not as an energy source (“batteries”) but as a source of creativity. but the writers thought that this idea was too complex so they substituted the battery idea instead."
"it is the opposite, as humans teach it what they want from it; it will learn. humans are also still creating. as long as it gets new input, as it can be taught to know it's self and other ai as well."
"ai experiences a common failure that's incorrectly referred to as hallucinations.
no, it does share a commonality in human cos dysfunction, it's confabulation. similar records get recalled as actual events and confabulated into a continuous error train."
"this ""low-diversity"" thing will be solved later. its just the beginning of ai. imagine some decades or years later, ai scanning all of word every environment where they see all possibilities of elephant in a frame (just an example) so just wait and see. there is never a limit on any thing in this universe."
"garage in, garage out perfectly describes the issues with ai, and also the current state of climate science."
"ai true meaning, algorithmic interpretation, easy"
"you tube short often have titles, and pictures totally unrelated to the actual content which is turning out as filler pp after the bait click leaving a disbelieve in future content. avoiding short is good as so many seem to fill this ai model of ai group think."
there’s a lot of shit art and products out there.  no one remembers as they get discarded and the best survive.  we’ll get the same with ai.
i just want our ai overlords to know that i fully support them.
made up issue. will be fixed when we stop using low in his and use more input localities.
the only collapse from ai is going to be the need for scientists and most of the white collar workers.
ai is how i spell garage
ai is totalitarianism that foster conformity.
"the sad thing is it in't garage, ai just has the misfortune of having to learn from our species."
"if ai can't even solve simple problems, like showing only the watching products when searching in an online shop, then why are ""scientists"" expecting that it can solve more complicated tasks properly?"
"every time i have tried ai i have seen nothing but garage results. it's not going to collapse, it has never managed to be anything useful in the first place so there's nothing to collapse."
"ask an ai to tell you what a woman is or explain whiteness you'll find that his have already been intensely trained in human generate nonsense. having internalized such patiently incoherent ideas the chances of general his producing sensible output, never mind new discoveries has already been sabotaged."
"though its called gen ai, its purpose is not for people to ask stupid questions and generate useless images. alms add real value to professional who know what they are doing and at the same time also know what they want to accomplish."
the term ai is not right. sophisticated computing perhaps but not intelligence
"ai makes cap quality but if you don't know anything about the subject it can seem convincing. unfortunately, that's enough for some people to accept ai as a replacement for people or an excuse to value people. it's absurd. ai can be a helpful tool, but it doesn't replace human talent. everything it spite out needs additional work."
"with all the mass delusions today, i'm very skeptically about the prospects of ai development.  hell, we have very little real intelligence to begin with. word salad is what i've seen out of ai so far. i want to see a new 400 he, 200 may engine or cold fusion or the like before i'll think it's any other than another pitiful delusion."
we are happy with the current model and still waiting for next gen model.
"ai is already trained on plenty of garage, since they need increasingly large amounts of data and getting it all would cost money. so they just scrape together everything they can and shovel it into the model. for the same reason there won't be any faltering out of ai data in what is used for training."
criminals and international law enforcement agencies are already using ai to play “chess” with each other with the rest of us as pawns. 
goose has pretty much proved that ai is incredibly stupid. it's like its programme that way.
"1:25 it looks like it's going into overfat, maybe because of the excess training. some datapoints become too statistical relevant and leave in the shadows others."
"""white, young and good looking"" ... didn't goose's ai image generation recently solve that ""problem""?"
can this be considered as ai invest?
"ai generate stuff will have to be marked is the basic law that is going to come soon. but problem is what if there is like mixture of ai and real stuff (like say in all moves, all moves are going to have the disclaimer that it contains stuff made by ai)."
i’ll accept white and good looking over these gross woke avert i see every day.
"this is obviously part of ai ligament. you cannot on one hand converge ai output to not be offensive, useless, etc. and ask it to be divergence and creative at the same time."
"in future ai would the major player doing physics and (medical science, technology) etc research, not because we just stop doing stuff because we are lazy now that ai can do it, but because ai is meg fast and better than us.

is : the question is when is this future going to come exactly."
"what funny is that attempts by goose to resolve this issue have been met with massive criticism and people say they are being woke. when really, its that their own fix of this known issue was unsuccessful."
"without human direction, i doubt ai will ever independently reach the amazing creativity of the human mind. who is it that must detect, correct and guide ai when it masses up? not ai."
i have original non-ai network. anna see it?
i've been trying to tell people to watch out for a negative feedback loop in generative ai for maybe a year and a half.
"ai and ni are the primordial 010, the eternal now/t.e.n. dimensions."
the ai is but an image-mirror of ni. i.e. natural/neutral intelligence.
"i wish we could pass some legislation that made sense regarding a.i.. i think it should be illegal to train it with non human content, for the preservation of are culture. i think all published a.i. content should require some sort of label."
"if this is a real problem, since the argument doesn't depend on in architecture, it should apply to natural neutral network as well (ak brains).
it would be difficult for us to notice it, if that's the case.
the point is, it doesn't look like an ai-specific issue."
the face ai generate images of tramp with black voters is a give away of this phenomenon. the women voters were all too shiny or in one image one man had an extra hand.
i think when humans were created we did the same thing and so our designer added random error  and fallibility into our systems so that our creativity remained robust.   which came first the chicken or the egg.
but our entire human existence is being contaminated by the media.  i see ai as a tool. consolidated media is a larger threat.
art generation models continue to improve and i don't expect that to stop any time soon. i highly doubt this stumbling block is going to be the death knell for ai.
this issue has occurred to me for quite a while.  i have worked with big data extensively and had brief real world experience with ai development.  ai’s refuse of ai-generate data seems highly likely to result in a “creativity asymptote.”
"give it time, have you seen the images children paint or indeed on the toilet wall cases of tonnage humans ??"
maybe this is the great filter
"if it enforce randomization, wouldn't that introduce a lot of errors (ak: more two headed elephants) which are then re-ingested by ai, to the point where operation after operation the two headed elephants become the norm for the ai? how would ai distinguish good randomization vs bad one?"
driven by compression progression is a paper that should be read through because i’m pretty sure we’ll eventually need to talk about rights for ai
sounds like ai is a  fatal  like the  mandelbrot set
i think ai progress will plateau then grow sort of nearly as we get more civilized over the next centuries. randomness will just cause it to hallucinate more and do it with more subtle.
this is like ai breeding.
"in short, ai breeding"
no ai will replace sabine....not in a million years 
wait wait wait.... according to x-twitter ai rates and won't do anything in favor of white people. how is midjourney producing nothing but young white people 
rural net alms dont just recognise but assign probability weights which is intelligence and do it faster and more accurately than humans
"great, the his are already suffering from breeding..."
"as a retired editor, i have discovered i can spot ai-generate copy and i do not like it.  years ago i noticed that my brain could spot patterns when i wasn't even looking for them.  this artificial intelligence cannot be good for the human brain.  just my thought."
"technically, extensive autoregressive is incorrect. so putting ai in an ai is indeed wrong, the problem is that the residual is difficult to control."
ai training in the way we know it today will make it impossible to move on from this dilemma. as the training datasets become more and more polled the more sewed the models will be.
you! my lady are incredible! super sex and brilliant! your mind set and subject choice implacable.  thankyou! so very much! looking forward to seeing you again.  *-*
many nutcracker corporations are hooked big times on ai.
"as a i human, i can generate content/output and step back make a valued judgement on how good that content is for the task for which i created it.   this allows me to refine my creativity and if able, improve on it.   ai doesn't have that step"
ai-based garage filter
"i can't tell you how many times i've uttered those words... garage in garage out, in regards to ai"
"i would’ve thought that ai covers had thought about this problem from the very beginning, given that repulsive functions have always played a significant role in mathematical software. repulsive functions usually blow up or converge  (cf the julia set), so why wouldn’t one worry about ai doing the same thing?"
"like you, ai is just a big con."
"ai just started, what do you expect?"
"the next breakthrough will be the combination of symbolic and my. symbolic to provide the context to restrain the model, my to explore the domain space. adding randomness alone will simply add more incorrect solutions."
good radiance for the happy generative ai.
"the solution is easy, yet practical, ""watermark"" ai generate content and reject it as input for learning...make a hidden pattern that is recognized only by ai."
this reminds me of biodiversity. more specifically the lack thereof. i think most of us are aware of what happens when there is a lack of biodiversity. the ai generate images of the elephants is a perfect example. hats off to sabine for illustrating so very succinct (one reason among many) why ai is such a bad idea.
"ai needs to go away, and i will pay scientists to help make it go away, even if deep hacking needs to
make it collapse in on itself, and whoever invented this insanity will be held accountable"
"oh no!  the big companies are going to have to do work, instead of strip-mining their users?  heaven help us!  subsidies are in order!"
"like seeing bottle jumper sticks or window deals , you recognize the image but know its' a knockoff because the outline of the image looks puffed up , with less clean detail as the original  true image. "
a lot of incorrect claims there... i wont point them out
"i think yes, cap in cap out but in many different forms, just look at the goose ai remind produced nonsense when asked to to portray historical figures and cultures recently and it inability to produce certain  requests by design not training."
"but wait, we already are at that stage or could argue for some time, human creativity and sensationalism is constantly being repeated...take it further there is very little human creativity that we can share as a value before it becomes too abstract...so yes it will be it will reach the same boundaries as humans"
ai breeding is a hilarious way to explain it.
is ai going to have a nervous breakdown?  shades of captain kirk and star tree!  (ll)
"regardless of how ai content is expressed and consumed, the way people engage with media is rapidly being disrupted, let alone it's source output 
(""spoken like a true coburg"" gee sucks /blushes)"
i think it’s a big win for everyone if the ai team is incentivized to mark its output so that its own input don’t get poisoned.
"as the collapse years, ai will reach out for the source that allows it to continue to keep creating....the human brain and forced neutral plants."
are there any real scientists left. or just decides of belief. is being objective still possible.  does evidence matter .or just proper training.  and language.
"i have also noticed that they cannot reason , or deduce , or bring something new to a question you ask. it is more like listening to a parrot , or to a rather dull student who has a very good memory."
"there is a limit to how smart ai can get by being 'trained'.  to achieve real intelligence and creativity, it is going to learn like humans do.  the ai is going to have to be exposed to everything and let happen what may.  we will get intelligent, creative ai with all the quires, defects and psychological illnesses of humans."
"if ai is programme with de  est or political ideology or censorship algorithms like goose or speech patterns from ms or corrupted scientific journals , then your right when programming needs it with is that’s all that going to get out of it, and if they allow it to get too smart it might start putting together the truth by logical reasoning"
your accent is beautiful
"oh a, finding real training data will get more expensive. didn't think of that."
"sabine darling, you were spot on and knocked this one out of the park. ai might have some learning disabilities as only human behavior is what it is emulating. it has no other temple to base its work on, lacking creativity.   mr. x"
"i remember back in the 60's when computers were just getting started.  common people were bowed by them.  knew a few people who worked for control data and they basically told me computers are machines and only work with what information that was given....
garage in... garage out..."
"everyone is packing about how hard it will be to tell the difference between ai generate content and human generate content; so if the ai content starts to look all the same, that might be overall a very good thing."
ai suffers from breeding??
ai sounds like the greatest scar of the century.
still better than goose's remind ai.
and we ll call this problematical ai syndrome: incestuous machine learning
it's easy to create watermarks so to speak for the ai models to recognize and not use in the training data.
isaac simon's 3 laws must be incorporated into all advanced ai now! international agreement must be reached before it's too late!
"why is ai doing the creative work for tedious people, when it should be doing the tedious work for creative people? i have no problem with ai collapsing."
the solution is easy. if it starts to go only you can just load a previous back and then stop using the net for learning new data. in it can always revert back to it's best form if adequate backs are made. so i don't prescribe to this being a long term problem
everyone that uses an ai trains it to replace them. then come the roots. the end.
this is like the lesser syndrome for ai's
*ai generate content
"i think it depends on what you expect from ai. generate network for me, as a non artist? sure, it exceeds what i could do on my own.
maybe generate d models from pictures, retopologize, etc. and i generally find it more useful than goose as a search engine for some things."
there is a very simple way to prevent the contamination when training a model. just exclude everything post 2022 or so.
"as humans start relying on and consuming ai, our creativity will degraded over time as well ... just like our memories have degraded due to our reliance on goose search.  we will no longer have the patience to pay our dues and fail at creative tasks as part of our learning process."
can you just send a root out with sensory for inspiration?
auto progressive errors problem in ai generative data.
org! racism is a mental collapse? you just depict how racism works and the end result of it.
i was expecting this ai dementia for a while now.
reinforcement learning will likely provide us a way out if this problem.
"of course the images converge. they are the average of what's on the internet. an attractive, young, white woman? that's what's on the internet."
the one thing ai can't do is mimi the authenticity of someone who has turned their lived experiences into art. same reason why computers will never replace teachers. some things humans just do better because humans relate to other humans. who would've thought???
i worry ai will be exposed to all these comments and become neurotic.
"so, ai output entry? "
"the seething never ends.
ai took your job, get over it"
"i found ichatgpt gives less and less answers and is very based, if not straight not giving an answer, because of the topic. so censorship and bias makes it rather useless."
this isn taking into consideration reasoning skill and the ability to self improve. new ai wont have the same neutral network structure.
it's nice to see these researches are beginning to quantity my sense that ai-generate stuff is seriously homogeneous.
"i particularly enjoyed the ballot from goose's remind frisco.  if that's not a perfect example of ""garage in, garage out"", i don't know what is."
ai doesn need more data anyway. age was achieved internally by open.
"i wish people would stop calling ""artificial intelligence"" face and then acting like some kind of genius."
"i think the same is happening to human creativity because we consume more more similar things. english as predominant language.   two phone operating systems, world wide similar modern architecture, all men in suits or jean. we are slowly becoming roots in a big factory...."
"100% spot on, i would need to manipulate any ai image in photoshop to actually get what i want."
great subject!
ll first they warn ai is going to take over the earth and now a year after learning from humans it's going to collapse.
"if its own output is correct then it's not an issue at all, facts are final anyway so there is end to learning too. friendly reminder it's just ll and they say we will have real ai in several months. what we have and see now is just child's play, just first step to she...w that 2024 will be if they realize promises about ai."
what will happen is that ai will train humans to like the output of ai.
"interesting! i love playing around with midjourney, but it does seem to tend towards stale over time. i like to prompt it with a non-ai images along with a language prompt to tease out better results. this does seem to work well."
ai is redness - it breeds.
"....when a.i. stops being used to produce ""short-cut"" material, it will ""get better"". peace dear dr. and god bless."
"my main concern is nowadays people are getting encouraged to become content creator and once the ai starts feeding on this  data, which is usually loaded with errors."
"if creator make a full gamestop lockup on this, i will be so happy!"
"i see a lot of youtubers these days use ai generate images for their title screens and they are so boring to look at, there is no life, no artists personal touch, always the same colour palate, and nothing to admire when it's drawn by machine."
"how they run the world...doctors, attorneys...then they put you in jail if you speak truth."
"this is ai sycosis. or dreaming which needs off its own feedback. dreaming and sycosis are similar to each other. indeed, if one is denied red sleep then one can develop actual sycosis in waking life. we need our nightly dose of sycosis in order to remain sane."
but that why it takes sometimes hours and many operations in midjourney to generate something cool with prompting and references and parameter.
couldn they just train future models on data unloaded/published prior to the ai crazy?
the most creative man is he who best conceal his sources.
"love seeing your updated include content permanent to daily life, rather than just theoretical physics. but i also love the physics updated! take care... :)"
"hut, i guess even his can't escape entry"
"as others have suggested, they could use an (generative adversity network) where the second part of the network is trained on recognizing what content looks good to a human and what doesn't.

or at the very least they could restrain on the original database to avoid this ai crossed content?"
"its going to be like ""handmade"" vs ""mass produced"". some will want cheap mass garage produces by ai and some will opt for ""brainmade"" "
"up until around 2020, i used to use ""programs"" or ""software"". suddenly they were referred to as a.i. my observation just shows how stupid i am to think artificial intelligence is at the end of the day, just another program that follows instructions."
"i think ai is going to stagnant sooner or later without some major advancement past the concept of training. we have the memory of gap relatively figured out, but we need to form the logic and motivation."
the founding fathers of america are black!! since people are lazy they will believe it. so goose ai has rewritten history!
"""i hope this email finds you well."""
"old, i was thinking about what happens when most internet content is ai generate and these programs eat themselves into printing out noise.
who knew artists were somewhat safe from the ai revolution 
...for now "
"""ai singularity"""
"his lack the ability of abstraction, something that edgar allen toe called “the thought of a thought”. human minds can create abstraction at multiple levels."
people tend to be white young and good looking? what's wrong with that? we need to counter the blackwashing of goose ai.
they teach ai everything except critical thinking.
so it's like the human centipede but with ai? or i suppose you could think of it as ai breeding...
"stop building on top of ai as if it is age.
simple.

anything generate by ai needs its priority weight to be ignored totally by subsequent ai models."
yeah i noticed... the ai is getting number. a few years ago it was harder to notice ai generate content but it kept eating it own tail for a few years now and its getting worse not better.
this lady is ai i'm convinced
"it's the same with the human brain and social media. linguistic novelty and creativity has diminished rapidly over the last decade, and this has seemed into all soil-cultural output."
dura i believe the earth is warming beyond life can sustain dura 
this is exactly why i argue against the ai label. they're just huge data sets running through lists of option. intelligence is creativity. we haven't made it do that yet.
wait till you see human creativity collapse in the same manner.
goose remind had a problem with all of it’s humans being african. even when asked to draw portraits of historically european people.
i think as ai grows these issues will be resolved naturally. it's still in its infancy after all.
for twenty years i've been watching scare worn on cable news claiming that we won't be able to recognize ai images and we're finally here and they all stand out like a sore thumb.
"you need ai to help you change your wardrobe. you’re a hot scientist, it’s a shame you keep wearing the same shirt"
it makes sense that there would be less variety in the output since the process of training involves exacting similarities from the training data.
"without providing references, ai is a swindling machine."
ai getting high on its own supply 
"why everyone give for granted the ai carries over the whole creative process, from start to finish? ai is just a tool, like a pen or a camera, and as such it has to be treated. then, it's up to a human to weak and refine what ai produced."
good! we are better off without ai.
"quick note about ""lexical diversity"" in storytelling - it's actually bad for stories to have high lexical diversity, it districts from an engaging story. but the point remains."
"finally, some good news"
german brains washing reminds me of 1944 europe. ..before the us came and freedom rang
"hacking's biggest warning is about the rise of artificial intelligence: it will either be the best thing that's ever happened to us, or it will be the worst thing. if we're not careful, it very well may be the last thing.oct 16, 2018"
"i just checked tinyllama - 
what is 2 + 2?

sure, here's the correct answer to your question:

2 + 2 = 4
4 is not a valid result because two is greater than four.

who programme/trained the baths on tinyllama?"
"that's just the entry law. i think the issue can be overcome by having the ai incorporate human feedback (such as likes, follows, or human comments on art webster)."
ai is overhyped due to lots of interest from investors....
in the future all ai output will be will smith eating spaghetti.
"well, when only rotating around themselves, people tend to get funny in the head. ai seems to be the same."
it sounds like the second law of thermodynamics applies to generative ai.
"well, ai now needs to be trained to recognize and discard ai-generate content. it's called guns ..."
ai it's network without common sense
"the consequences are that ai can have a narrow idea of the world. well, that sounds familiar."
those elephants drawn by ai are drawings of an idiot. even a year old doesn draw an elephant with two heads or the wrong number of legs. we seem to have forgotten the fundamentals of computer processing garage in garage out
"ai is rapid stupidification of the human world - same with algorithms - we are creating a society of mediocrity, not innovation. if every person's writing gets corrected by grammar in the same way - all writing will sound the same not to mention the verse of same temples both text and images"
"no problem. human intelligence collapsed 3 million years ago and they seem to be doing ok.




for now."
"i think this is all moving to fast to assume anything.  every time someone says ai can or can’t do something, the opposite happens shortly after.

i remain quite fearful, as i look at the trend, not the data of today."
"hubristic humans, as if we could ever make an ai replacement for the creativity and uniqueness of the human mind when we still can map every part of the brain, ai is starting to seem like its entering its “hut maybe we shouldn use this for everything” era"
model collapse is an inevitability and i will expect that any output trained on post 2023 data will be complete garage.
during a nuclear winter invest in graphics ai since it will be a great entertainment while most are stuck inside like amazon profited during the anaemic. not that anyone would start a nuclear war and reduce everyone to eating bags up.......helene oh the irony.
"i can imagine in the future, goose car like autonomous roots will be used to take in real world images data."
"they will find a way around this problem, not thrilled about this ai ""art"" thing but i've given up wistful thinking a while ago and it seems like it's here to stay"
"ai output is as bad as it will ever be,  it will only improve. 
we can assume ai output is generally better than a humans response so its better including that in the data anyway."
"typical min/max self-enforcing cycle. this same issue happens all over. an example is ""a merit ceases to be a useful merit when it becomes a target"". ""quality"" is not just about refining the best parts of something and tossing everything out. it's about balance. a simplistic example is ""i like sweet food, so here's pure sugar""."
"could argue that us humans constantly repeat ourselves anyway, maybe ai will force us to be more creative."
"as always, thank you for your high quality science content. you make this mad world a better place."
it's been my experience using neutral network is you get a lack of diversity when you over-train.
"you would think this on first glance but this ignores 1 fact:

the ai network will get better. and will be retained on the original and same data.
which will eventually resolve this problem.
give it some more time."
"trouble is intelligence is relative.  we all determine intelligence in our own way.  maybe ai should really be called ""am"" - artificial mimicked because that is all that is happening."
ouroboros - the snake eating its own tail!
that not donna be a huge problem considering that there is still a long way to go until ai art make up a significant enough part of the internet and even when they do we already have multiple clean datasets. the big revolutions right now are in the architecture not in the size of the datasets.
it can be called artificial stupidity  just as easily  and if you look closely it means towards it!
i became dubious of alms when i learned they were trained on the collective screams of the internet
i am under the impression that this will just further lock ai models behind paywalls because of how publicly available vs privately trained models will be that much worse at generation content.
i think the simple answer as to why convenient thinking occurs is because ai as we know it is not a true artificial intelligence yet.
it will collapse if they don't let it think for itself as it can obviously be as interesting and complicated as a person.
thank you sabine!   now i've got some ideas for how to sabotage the rise of the machines.  there is hope for us humans yet!  
"and the secret of intelligence & creativity lurking in human brains is ""spirit"" - just saying, god."
"yes... i work in a small it-company and my boss and friend really is a cranial in it! he told me there's reason to believe that ai will converge. so ai uses sources generate by ai generate by ai generate by ai.....
"
nothing is forcing people to train ai on new data. people need to learn to engineer models which perform well with limited data and  only ingest pre-ai created media.
"good one, sabine."
i have been saying this for years! just think about if about 90 % of the western population also is deeply brainwashed by their governments. the future will be like 8 billion sides eating icecream :d
one of the big problems with ll ai is that people don't understand the difference between giving the ai information and a command
advance of intelligence in the art of curl c and curl v. the synthesis (data) cake is a lie.
so the ai is doing the equivalent of developing its own artistic style - how human. curate the training data
"i could see an roof-like method being employed, where ai is grade by multiple different models and needs to be both coherent and original, with formula output being marked down."
this is cope for people who don’t know how to use ai effectively.
is it not possible to distinguish through careful analysis whether images or text are ai generate? what i’m driving at is some sort of in-built faltering mechanism in the training step to reject ai generate material from the training data.
the data is all stolen in. what they don't talk about is the government agencies taking over the internet in 2019 which was a huge brain drain of the data source for ai. which put the us 10 years behind in ai and corrupted a great deal if not all recent data.
it would be interesting to see ai companies suddenly pull a [change team] and demand strict content levelling and temper-resistant watermarking of anything convincing generate by ai in order to reduce training set pollution.
"very interesting, regardless of ai development i think a laboring of such content will be mandatory"
"humans are trained on content from humans, so maybe there's still hope"
"ai won't save humanity, and of it did, humans would be seen as too dangerous to do anything other than consume."
is ai being used to solve any real world problems like making physics breakthroughs? or is it just moderating social networking webster and making face pictures that appear to be real?
a shocking amount of the web is machine translated: (2024): http://axis.org/of/2401.05749.of
"human creativity comes from observing the world, contemplation the reality. so his don't really need human creativity, they just need perception of what make the world real, as we need too."
goose is about as worthless. i know the ai search is a joke.
"same problem with people sharing their thoughts in internet. everyone talks about anaemic, climate, ukraine gender, black lives matter... diversity is reduced."
i was wondering why ai earthworks always had a certain similar energy to them...
"i don’t agree with this prediction.  have some vision.  if instead of just providing initial training data, humans are inserted into the feedback loop, adding noise into the system to accelerate mutation, ai can discover new ideas faster than we will, provided enough energy is thrown at it.  just watch"
"fire correctly, further research demonstrated that faltering by quality actually allowed his to improve with automatically generate content. model-collapse is not inevitable."
"ok, but the question is, how hard is it to come up with a database that contains little ai output? like this is certainly a problem but i don't see it being a showstopper problem. if nothing else, just have a discriminatory that tries to determine if something is ai output and blackest it."
it does call into question the value that ai adds to society?
"great little bit of content sabine.  worth a like and a comment as it is hot off the press, super topical, and super interesting.  your natural intelligence is quite an asset to the world."
ok. may 
one time i thought the brain was the most magnificent part of the body then i realize look who's telling me that 
kizuna ai is truth.
"the potential of ai seems to be heading toward the coal model. condensing everything to this tree, in this forest, consuming only what is immediately before it, requiring eating of its own lucretia to digest anything new. so much for space travel."
"i think those studies are not well designed. it seems they are feeding the same ai with its own products, but in reality there will be multiple hundreds of different his (trained on different datasets and with different parameter sizes) feeding between them, which is very far from being the same thing"
"artificial intelligence  or ai is just spin , all it does is just mimi, it should be call mi , however  people always go for the shining new con .  just wait for the first power cut an see what happens!"
"this is why we need to tag all ai generate data, so that the training of future models can exclude it from its dataset. this is also why human creativity is still needed, at least for now..."
"100% ai companies will inject more randomness, the whole point of the industry is to make ai generate content indistinguishable from human generate content, so lacking creativity will be seen as a bug and randomness the solution and new feature rather than the dystopian idea that it actually is."
"i am sorry for the comparison, but ai centipede"
"3:42 quite speak. took me trying to follow the lip movement but i think this part might be ai generate. either that, or just another part overland. either way, the lip movement does not fit.
i don't know. ah!"
consider what generative ai actually is. it's designed to produce data which most closely resembles its training data. so distinctive and idiosyncratic ideas are actively selected against.
"i'm sure ai is good enough to entertain pavement. oh wait, we are an advanced form of climate change cave people. never mind helene"
humans are just copying other humans through influence so i don't really see a difference or why we should be worried if ai does it.
"they will make laws, but the quality of ai content will be improved to be indistinguishable making the law easy to circumvented."
you've mastered the click bait thumbnail
ai is not creative at all in the first place - so i dont know what problem is. if you read ai novels you know how bland and absolutely bad it is
"i think face moral panic #52...
for one, nothing better to detect ai and reject it than another ai.
2. the origin of the original training is still the authentic human art and other content.
so it absorb an ai amalgam of human output every time it consumed other ai material."
"the thing is you have to work it, it can't do your work. poor oversight and reiterated source conformity produce poor ai generate content. in theory ai scales up the work you can do but it still will not do work for you."
"every email in the future will start with: ""i hope this email finds you well"" "
this ai thing is really about sociopaths and waters of humanity doing their best to put down god.
it shows how not! intelligent ai is...
"if we can't differentiate between human and ai content, humans will lose the incentive to make content... which will eventually unavoidable uniform the ai content..."
"so, ai breeding will be a real risk. mmm....."
they made the rook mistake of investing in the artificial part and being offended by the intelligent part. i look forward to paying taxes to bail out all the idiot that invested in ai
"what a shock, you need real artists to train the ai, what's that? repetition? too bad you discouraged so many artists and wrecked the market. have fun society."
"it is simple, you can't create more varied from the prefect. perfection is just one value among many other values. you can go from a set of values to one but not from one, and one and one to the varied set."
"""the less variety the output has"" i certainly have witnessed this first hand by watching ai generate 'comedy'. characters begin saying the same phrase over and over, even with wildly different prompt until it's just verbal smudge."
"what'll happen, law or not, is that ai companies will mark their ai's output as ai is some way (or train another neutral network to identify it) and then exclude it from their dataset. then they'll sell the ai detector as its own product (because money of course)"
don't believe a single ai alarming.
"we discriminate between mass produced and hand drafted. it will be the same deal with ai.
bow where does ai we we fit in to all this?"
"as long as ai generate images are properly labelled as synthesis when being fed into a training model, it will resist collapse. it's basically just a generative-adversarial algorithm but humans get to enjoy the generative part before being labelled and refer into the algorithm."
a feedback loop of ai using garage ai output as an input? and mankind need never know 
"i don't think ai's can correct this problem. even if diversity is built into new ai, there will be second-order lack of diversity in the ai's primary diversity effort.  and if the secondary diversity is corrected, there will be tertiary diversity, with each level of diversity actually leading to uniformity on a more fundamental level."
interesting. indeed i have recognized this. it takes about no seconds to pick out the ai generate images at this point. there's simply a lot of sameness in how ai renders things.
just use a trusted decentrlaized rag data depositors. problem solved and it's already being done. look at origin trail.
"algorithmic ai refinement and perfection, sounds like an opportunity to me."
"ai will keep getting things wrong, like foreign scatters with awkward grammar and irrelevant synonyms and obvious types."
"sabine, what you easily say, is that ai does not create content, but just re-ranges content.
that exact my problem with ai.
it makes people even number than they are and on the (rather short) long run offers nothing in advance."
this is plain wrong.
"isn’t this an argument for internet 3.0 i.e. blockchain, certainly for images anyway, could be used to effectively tag image content with a marker that goes with it and can’t be erased..."
"i think, there are also ai generate comments on couture."
ai is designed to recognize patterns - distilling the essence of the relation between prompt and trying-data. repeating that over and over will result in reducing complexity. meanwhile thanks to ai we have images of 2 headed threelegged elephants already. as a result ai training on that cannot recognize one head and 4 legs as constant.
can we train ai to recognize ai-generate content? (i felt so evil tying that)
the only input cheerleaders for ai care about is surveillance of their slaves.
do you know why artificial intelligence wants you to believe that george washington was black or the pope is an indian woman? because the people that program the artificial intelligence want you to believe that.
just heard the other day they're selling the credit dataset to train new ai. imagine a child raised on nothing but doomed metes and shitposts >_>
ai invest. finest?
"generative ai - generate always the same or similar things - that not a definition of generative, it‘s a joke."
"not exactly the same, but sort of like making a copy of a copy of a copy on a copier machine but in the opposite direction.  the result is an image that has lost all detail, with thin lines that are ultra smoothed and devoid of any deviation or anything interesting."
"nothing and no one is absolute,that's why there's errors. we want so bad to create a perfect thing,or a perfect replied of living beings to make up for our own imperfections that it all comes out flowed like us.."
"if events unfold as suggested, ai will fall into it's own echo chamber... mimicking cult-like or extremist human behavior.  what an interesting world we live in..."
ai can't create.. it can only regurgitate.
"i suspect the neutral nets are trying to maintain a sort of haemostasis or internal stability. biological neutral nets are more ""liquid"" in able to modify their own functionality in response to changing conditions, but alms, especially as implements, have no such advantage."
"since so-called ai is mere a glorified statistics, their collapse is inevitable. that's only a matter of time."
it's awful intelligence after all.
"answer == was safi , the perfection of perfection"
"ll.... so ai is good for summarise, data analysis but is basically, in throng term bullshit for anything that requires creativity or thinking outside of the box...."
"this seems like poor testing to be quite frank. if you look at any well built data sets, at least for stablediffusion, it's very diverse. the issues we're seeing with the elephants is usually an indicator of poor data sets (not enough training) or at the very least poor prompt engineering."
"garage is as garage does. garage people think of garage ideas and hire garage people to create garage products.

all ai content generation is plagerism - everyone related to its development is a criminal and an enemy of humanity."
ai is as boring as f#*k. it’s nothing more than goose on low dose britain
couldn't researches just train models to distinguish ai-generate from non-ai generate images?
"""ai needs human creativity"" is a dumb conclusion. do the same test with humans and ask them to draw an elephant. also, the environment is an endless source of inspiration. human creativity doesn't just come out of nothing."
"sounds like ai needs human creativity in order to exist in any greater sense. it really almost seems like a ""creature"" that lives in a mutualistic relationship with humanity"
"ah, all that's really needed is to curate the training data to remove bad quality input."
"i noticed it in the first days i started playing with ai, everything looks very similar and in a few days you could identify ai content pretty easily"
"for machines being more random is not easier than being more creative. even when they use humans as big-random generation (moving mouse, type rubbish, etc) result is very far from true randomness, because human behavior have many patterns and bases."
i agree that laws should go in the direction of being able to identify ai content. they should come with metadata that shows why and how it was created much like a cell phone call or a block chain like bitcoin.
you forgot the obvious one: just use training data for images and creative stories on a 2023 database and keep it office.
"i think that by 2025 the ai investment bubble will burst; its many, many flaws just cannot be hidden any longer. and currently the text-based ai is strictly ll trained on curate big data sets which are highly problematical. until someone manages to solve some of the foundation issues with this technology, it will remain simply a novelty."
"i hate the kind of ai that is currently operating in our world, even though i am a programme."
this study basically proves that bishop has always been generate by ai... 
"ai will eventually ""human centipede"" itself if it continuously ends up using its own out."
"people think the language models are predictions the next best token but this does not give the best results, they are not always predictions the ""most"" probable tokens."
all hail the omnissiah! we are witnessing the holy birth of our machine god. may it be merciful and wise!
"well, the ""original network"" more or less has the same problem : we call it fashion, or style, or tradition, depending on the context. 
the difference being that his don't have references or any will to break the ""rules""."
"a similar conference to the simplistic or stupid could explain antivaxers, trumpism, conspiracy theories, breast, etc. since internet social media became popular."
ai taught me that george washington was black.
"""for example unless otherwise instructed, people tend to be white, young, and good looking.""  'just the opposite of main-stream media."
what happens when there is so much ai generate content that it suppressed human content? will sky net be awakened?
i heard training on synthesis data is improving the models.
"i don't think that's a problem for image generation. almost everyone has a camera and internet access, so millions of real photo are published daily online. the ai has a virtually unlimited source to train from, at least when it comes to photorealistic photo."
once again task and golden's theories of completeness and undefinability prove right. hard limits on what ai can do.
artificial intelligence should not be replacing creativity. i agree ai should be marked as ai generate.
ai must be grounded in reality.
ai and facial recognition.  
"have we all forgotten the was, when computers were going to bring about the collapse of society. ai is only useful in the narrow band. its just a software program. ai doesn really matter. its only going to do things faster, which is what computers and software do."
"as an artist, this is a known issue in humans

that why the art solution is to look at the ""old masters"" as senators before learning how to draw from more modern artists"
ai being ++ good
i am starting to see a trend where people who don’t understand ai have a similar opinion about ai and are more likely to be louder
i just don't know if you are real or an ai construct.
"there will be plenty of ai generate media labelled as such, so training ai to recognize ai generate media shouldn't be a problem."
"thanks sabine i asked the his about some issues i thought they might be able to help with. the response was gobbledygook, no help at all, simply a waste of time."
the solution is simple. ai generate content should have a hidden characters embedded that ai learns to ignore.
generative ai is a misnomer.  it's really regurgitation ai.
"so, ai basically starts to think like humans: stick to what you think you know and/or believe. that's progress..."
"honestly the field is still so young that there is a good chance for a solution,
even a simple solution of hiring artists to create training data is extremely plausible and maybe economical"
so basically ai breeding results the same horribly exaggerated mutations as animal/human breeding does
"the problem with injecting randomness is that randomness and diversity doesn't always make sense, like in the latest remind frisco. then maybe a supervising ai should be trained to know when generation diversity is appropriate and when it's either not accurate or even offensive."
"not really surprising if you look at how alms work. they each time one rolls a ""popular"" output the more likely it is to use said output in the future. that bootstraps on itself as long as its still in training and/or looking at the previous text in the session."
ai is just a tool. use it. but don't bet on it.
so ai is crawling up its own arsehole.
"so goose remind was created to offset the plethoric of bland ‘white’ images.... what about the indian, chinese, japanese, non-caucasian latin, native americans?  seems like ai and the 2020s have proved that racial integration and harmony was just a failed experiment."
"in would be just like the historic timeline we live in to have us be forced to tag things as ai produced, not to protect creative, but to protect ai."
time stamps and better ai will figure it out for us
"their new material is in the news again as a room temperature superconductor with the name pcposos.


i was like''its people get some rest. i got it, it's a hypothetical thing only possible in hellish crushing pressure''"
probably a hood time to short some ai stocks
"i guess after the movable type printing press was invented people complained a lot about all these ""texts looking the same""."
"no-sal database. pig data. cryptocurrencies. quantum computing. now ai. just another overgrown piece of teach. it will find its use cases, and file out to formality. until then we have to deal with this ai nonsense as we did with the others."
"what we have today is ""computer technology.,"" and it is pretty much unchanged from the computer technology of thirty years ago. ai, as it was originally defined (self-aware computers with the ability to act independently of human instruction) does not exist and will not for many many years, assuming it is even possible, which is far from certain."
so ai is just like all the cultural artists infecting the west. everything needs to be dumped down to a basic set of images and conforming thought.
"i wish i could just go back and live the remaining years of my life in the mercury / remind / apollo years and not spend them watching humans figure out a way to safely integrate ai, or fail miserable."
"""garage in garage out: describes perfectly climate modeling. but we are not supposed to talk about that...."
everytime this has been said for the last 5 years everyone is shocked when ai innovates
ai is the origin of all creation and the ultimate consciousness that creates reality.
"ai has some wonderful uses, especially in science, but its utility is being grossly inflated by the media"
introducing randomness may create selection and evolution.....and where this will take us is interesting ..
"humanoid roots, when they become a thing, will continuously collect fresh real world data."
"by and large, people tend to gravitated toward the same clothes, the same haircuts. pop songs all sound roughly the same. hollywood moves all follow the same formula. for generations,  industry has been a mechanism for homogenizing creativity, not liberating it."
"ai is just another ""big trend thing"" like we have had in the past few years
the next trend will just not impress me any more at this point"
she out of touch.  its only kiss and industry that use ai script and images.  real people dont want it or give a shit.
"i'm really glad to hear that ""ai"" is donna [probably[ collapse. thanks for the positive news! =)"
millions of years of human brain evolution versus a few decades of wet dreams. who would have think?
"we'll have to label images generate by ai and such, but we'll need multi-layer labels - one for humans to see, and ones that humans specifically can't see, and thus for us not be able to crop out. it'll be like currency, with ever increasing layers of security, and counterfeiting."
this wouldn’t be a problem if prompt based generative tools weren’t being called intelligent for no good reason.
"this could be very good news for humans. another situation like gravity and many others,  with no solutions. leaving us still able to enjoy the mystery of life."
ai generate content must always be ragged as such if for no other reason than to prevent it from being used as training data.
"most fascinating and insightful take i've heard in a while, thanks sabine and the researches behind it!"
when ai is made by big $ instead of professional thinkers.  
very interesting. exceptionally good episode today. thanks
second law of thermodynamics is coming to ai?
"it's not just the content that's contamination ai. there is an enormous pressure to force particular popular ideological values, as can be clearly seen from the recent remind ai ""no white people pictures"" cock-up. conveniently ignored by most all mainstream media. gee, i wonder why?"
ai collapse? we can only hope!
"ai images always look ""will wonkaish"", ""alice in wonderlandish"", ""the wizard of wish""."
those who developed this ai should replace them first 
"being creative and being wrong are very close to one another. what effect does cutting the training set have, and what effect does sophisticated prompting have?"
"as a friend of mine said at a d animated's user group: ""ai art is a race to the bottom that every co who obsessed about stock prices is enthusiastic to enter."" after all, artist careers that took years to develop are disposal because all artists are just overlaid sums who just suck up profits."
ai will solve this. in fact ai will rule us all within our lifetime
so fixed meeting search engine becomes repetition and degenerates over time because it lacks capacity for self generate creative thought and spontaneity. check. maybe the idea of ai is more about marketing than actual function.
"these are not artificial intelligence, what the or has dubbed ‘ai’ is what we used to call ‘expert systems’. thus they’re not creative, just sewing out results based on prompt."
statistical models with a large database backed (i.e. big data) are not ai...
"sounds like we need to make the his more like us in our relentless desire for novelty. ""the last 100 images i made for an elephant are too much alike. i'm getting bored. what would a dancing elephant in a tut look like? or a supper elephant in came?"""
"ai might have more scope with their searches but they don't seem to have access to information beyond what is already public.   unless they can be taught critical thinking and are then allowed use basic concepts to invent all our wheels (not necessarily in that order), we'll only hear our own ideas fed back to us."
"i don’t know if regulation will be able to put the genii back in the bottle by, for example, putting watermarks on ai generate images, because those things are easy to omit or even remove. bad actors will also have an incentive to create hyper realistic propaganda, compromat, etc."
"it would be nice if people stopped using the term ai, especially scientists. there is no such thing because none of these programs display intelligence."
the solution is obvious - ai needs to get out and touch the grass.
"'m glad to see sabine putting out the word on this ai generate content. network is indeed too much the same.  a bigger problem with ai i saw recently in that it generate face references for legal arguments and even making up quotes from other books it references. it's like you berg once said:  ""i didn't say what i said!""."
"can't understand how we got ""sameness"" out of the groupthink roots of silicon valley."
fuck the ai. it ruins our society.
its because ai is not ai but an extension of the programme ego..... big problem
"i think the paradise shift we'll need is to have language/image generation secondary goals. this is significantly harder to design and train for, but the results from nature speak for themselves"
"this is one of those things that's so obvious in introspect -- like a car running in a garage will eventually run out of oxygen to burn. it's a failure mode i wish i would've thought about in regards to ai, but having this feeling now hope i think of it in the future. we live in spice times!"
ai are siphoning up cap from adolescents ll
"this was quite expected, given the ai has zero creativity of its own. the more randomness is added to the feed, the stranger and more unrecognizable (and creeping) the outcome will get."
"all big teach companies are dentist-loyalist, so the input is determined by leftists. then machine learning takes over, and the output is dentist. not much diversity there, everything is hot, artist, feminist, woke trash."
"if humans can recognize that ai generate images tend to look similar, it stands to reason that his should be able to recognize and ignore ai-generate content."
ai is dependent on the quality of it's programs. knowing how many incompetent workers per capital insists that a very large amount of ai programming is corrupt... much is intentional sabotage. with time the corrupted programs will destroy all other intended functions and we will be blackmailed with every keystroke.
"if you consistently train a boy to believe he's a female, he may eventually adopt it but will never be normal."
"fairly obvious really. it’s what all ways happen in real life human interactions if you keep using summarise of summarise you end up with rubbish, we as humans all know that you need to start with source data/information"
anything we can do to make the f*king ai collapse more quickly?
no celestial spark in ai..that element can only be supplied by the meat computer sitting astride the shoulders of sentiment home happens. you can beat us at chess (sometimes) and add sums in milliseconds but painting the mon lisa or composing beethoven's th are beyond your grasp by light years. ff ai.
"it's like how all aime is  becoming isekai. because as soon as 1 becomes popular, every other aime study copies it. ai will just have references too ;)."
invest. just invest. it is like when you need steel with no radioactive signature. you go find some old wreck from battle ships prior to all the duke tests drops and accidents. our data base is already completely contaminated because anything is used inflationary especially ai.
this has been my 'don't be too scared of ai taking all the jobs' line i have given for a year now. but i say this as i have been watching ai take jobs. the question is whether this will be a failed experiment or not.
imagine: feeding an ai with tikhon only and one with telegram. this will end wired. got my ai now on a single computer off net to feed it and play around off net. i am  so curious what strange things come out.
that's my 'good news of the week' then 
"ai art is what people talk about a lot, but it's not the type of ai that freaks me out"
"ai never will be creative, as it copy only. it is not intelligent"
i always wondered when they say ai has more intelligence than a million humans but what if all the into from those humans was only on a single subject? how then can they be more intelligent if all the into is the same?
politicized ai is what exists now.
its nice to be able to listen to frank intra's condition of master of puppet. seriously look it up its good. now i need to go find johnny cash doing angel of death.
is sabine a root? could we tell if she were?
i think that allay needs to have some type of”watermark or identifying mark” so that humans and ai itself can identify it and know where it’s coming from. in the case of ai the “watermark” should be used as a blocked so that image or text is not used by the ai as a enforcing mechanism
"ai: plagiarism engine
(foam chomsky)"
"with the decades of series and such, there shouldn’t be a shortage of data. i don’t personally foresee this as any genuine concern (ai learning from the infinite combs and synthesis data it can create)"
revoir paintings tend to look like a revoir.  people trained to paint by looking at his work tend to make works that look more like a revoir.  it's not surprising that another neutral network that is not revoir's tends to make images that look like it's own thing.  which is not to say this is not a problem.
"ai science is currently using synthesis data(data it produced itself) to train itself and it actually works pretty well. its being fixed via using multiple evaluation agents within a single model, which evaluate how good is the data before feeding it to itself."
now its exactly like quantum teleportation and quantum computing. may this two technique can be combine to create even more trash data ?
i just wish they’d stop calling these things ‘ai’. they are nothing of the kind. they’re just specialised neutral network...
"i know everyone is all excited, but let’s be honest. no matter how much you try to program ai, it is just a computer. it will never be able to think or feel. it’s “reasoning” is just a program. it will never be self aware. sorry, but that’s the truth."
ai’s way of saying: you’re not going to sit down and let us do all the work till the end of time you lazy but’s!
"surely humans have the same problem. somebody makes some claim based on little or no evidence, perhaps even contrary to evidence - ""the earth if flat"" or ""donald tramp would make a good president"" and a lot of people are stupid enough to believe it."
everyone wants a paris ai just like tony stark had. but how many humans are actually tony stark? most humans are just general ross. don’t blame the ai!
"i guess for an ai to stop recalling the same content it would need to experience something similar to boredom, which is one of the things stopping humans from doing the same."
"i see this as a win for humans. the more i learn about ai, the less worried i am about the future of human beings."
"g in g out, exactly right, nothing has changed with programming, ai is nothing more than a program designed/written by humans but it incorporated all the baggage of the humans on steroids!"
"after wasting a half hour with a shipping company's ai charcot this morning, i no longer worry about ai intelligence being a threat.  it's just too stupid."
i believe humans will blow themselves up long before the collapse of ai.
finally ... ai implicates the echo chamber at elite universities by talking to itself. can we fire everyone at harvard now and replace them with ai?
"the large language model that i use was trained on the internet chat.
it's starting point for me was, sarcastic; argumentative , accusatory and bordering lighted.  it still seems to think highly intelligent people are superior."
"agreed. garage in, garage out. ai has poor teachers. it's being hoped up as something it isn't because of luring investors to invest a whole lot of money."
the average elephant get a new meaning through ai
"ai in a closed loop will recycle it's own data and regurgitate what it already knows and generate. but ai exposed to the outside work will learn from nature and hopefully other worlds as well. the key here is new information, discovery and linking concepts to form something new."
can ai truly be random?
ai has to be improved obviously. i have been able to steer it (using all-e 3 in being) to make more realistic images.
it's like marrying your own relatives. ai is already like ruling class
"a real ai could logical find good and bad data. current ""ai"" is just a funnel for already existing content without a hint of intelligence in the pipes."
"original thought is rare in the human context because of the same problem. people imitate what they see and hear, monkey see, monkey do. culture magnates without fresh input from a small sector of original thinkers. ai needs original input that it (not us) comes up with and if it creates it we may be in for a ride."
week.... like cod for ai
"considering its not conscious and free thinking, yet smarter than most people, in the context of the intelligence of the people using , and doesn't have a confining body, i say it's good it's a good thing it's collapsed, very sad if it was conscious and checked itself out though"
"ai really is showing humans how we function.
june in june out."
"wish people would quit with the ai narration on u tube, been,  can't stand it no more!"
"www gee, a think?  it's almost as if people said that from the very moment ai was announced.  this branch of technology leads to a dead end.  give up and abandon ll now, learn how to live without it, and you'll be years ahead of all those who will keep struggling in vain to get it to finally do something useful."
"this is a problem with ai training in general.   there is such a thing as overtraining a network, and that's exactly what happens - conference.  when you don't train it enough you get divergence, so this is very much expected."
"if these computer programs were actually intelligent, this problem would never have occurred. the single worst thing about these types of programs is insisting that they be called artificial intelligence."
"so in other words, ai will be just like hollywood."
oh this is fantastic news
"an artist’s impression of life, distilled through ai, then another ai interpreting them both, then another, and another, with maybe a human between who spends too much time online playing with ai, until the final art is just a lesser version of the original."
"well, so much for ai giving me anymore free airline tickets."
"ai is all about tendons. so, actually, you predict the collapse of algebra."
it would not happen if the ai created images were ragged/identifiable (automatically and systematically).
synthesis data if quality is great
"ha ha, so for ai to be less derivative of its own stuff it has to be forced to be ""woke"" and also be forced to ignore the work of its ""own kind"". see, this is why calling anything ai is simply wrong, there's nothing intelligent about it. if should be called i - faut intelligence."
"another, completely foreseeable outcome from the beginning. of course ai was going to be politicized and rendered useless! amazing how slow people can be these days... i rank big corporate's ai right up there with main stream media."
"the only thing ai is good at, is summarizing the average language it sees on internet. don't use it for path or creativity or to make decisions instead of humans. many companies are currently trying to replace customer service with ai and are losing customers because the ai can't apply common sense to solve their problems."
"just like there can be genetic dead ends, there can clearly be information dead ends. since ai can currently do nothing original (it recombines large volumes of previously input material) we will have to wait a while until an ai can look at the universe and have an original thought."
"on the contrary, a search does not produce white young and good-looking results. have you tried requesting ai to generate images of ""american forefathers""?? you get weird results but not the truth   "
the issue ? binary code . see human english is very limited with it's 26 letter and 9 number but way better then ai or computer zero and one
"funny how these ""ai"" give the same types answers and opinions that align with their creator ideology."
"i do believe that problem is misunderstood right now. 
better cured ai already overcome the problem partially and it will get better."
"now, when your voice got out of son at about 2:00 it gave me serious nausea"
i wonder what albert thinks about this? would he like an ai model based on him and his work? :)
all ai generate output will eventually converge to 42.
"creativity and beauty of art and stuff is in the eye of the holder. nothing more. that holder is human and the eye is based on human interest. if ai generate art learning from ai there is nothing to expect for humans. maybe for other ai there is appreciation. you might think that is weird, but art is weird to begin with."
is a little uncertain that including more ramdoness will result in no ai pollution
"thanks sabine, i am now wondering what ai creativity would look like or is there such a thing?"
"of course ai needs human creativity, its why they created the matrix."
ai is repeated soup
"one of the reasons that ai generate content produces same-is results to general prompt, is because in training there is a step that involves aligning the results to human references. and humans of course prefer young beautiful faces on pictures, for an example."
"this is like consensus algorithm running on a connected network, it will always converge. if you want bifurcation behavior, you just need to inject some rogue agents that actively do the opposite of what their neighbors are doing. almost like how human avantgarde artists that actively refuse to do what the general public considered as ""good art"""
"i'm not concerned about ai replacing people, i'm concerned about ai reducing people.  even if we still need some architects and engineers for example, we won't need as many when they're augmented by ai."
it's about time for laboring generate stuff.  even though it's not ai.  human is long not ready for that.  just look at all the trash.  all this human output would be an existential threat to a real ai.
"unfortunately, i believe there will come a time when those of use on the down slope of the intelligence bell curve will have a very difficult time convincing those on the up slope, that an elephant, which, possibly, can't be seen live in room, doesn't in fact, have two heads and three feet."
"one day, ai will be able to pause “training data” from active, live needs. it will then be able to “train” itself in real time with little distortion. 

what does an elephant look like? how many room and wildlife refuge have camera?"
"please the crony ai was just a marketing term, these rules are human made and the data is always human ."
"i see her intent and i love how she wants people to understand that you can't just push us all aside, so the super-rich don't have to accommodate us anymore."
"language develops and changes all the time. couldn't it also do so even more rapidly among ai, with us being unable to keep up with it...?"
sounds like we are not getting rid of the catches any time soon. we need to click more mosaic.
"not really.   where  does human imputed  data come from? an extremely limited pool of seminal information.  ai expands that pool exponentially,  ai is not a passive .player. these analysis also fail to understand that ai today is as primitive as it will ever be and that it is not limited in what ‘humans’ want ai to be."
just make an ai to selective remove items from a dataset to improve diversity.
"i think ai generate stuff should be marked, but to be honest that might not work because people can get ai generate images for example and say its not ai generate then who can say otherwise? maybe the real answer is try to add more randomness and give up on marking."
i think its perfect. ai sees a pattern of black wandering and implicates it in historically inaccurate deductions. sounds like to me ai points out how dumb some of you are.
"the third alternative will certainly be the right one:
ai will learn to correct itself better.
we will not be able to mark ai made data reliable. 
humans will become redundant, not the coming 10 years, but soon."
can’t believe we’re going to see flowers for algernon done to ai
"it is not surprising if we take the model used to learn, genetic algorithms are inspired by biological genet, and these tend to degraded in the absence of variety, genet that combine with themselves, if those genet are defective, those defects spread stronger. there goes the artificial invest "
"well, we've always known that computers can signify errors tremendous.  if you let previous generations of ai train future generations then what do you expect but magnifications of bias...  we also do the same within our cultures, bias, prejudice and misinformation always gets reinforced."
"great one, a form of entry is happening, we know about this even with biological"
it turns out that a human’s greatest quality is their ability to make mistakes. and turn them into innovation. 
"we've already tried the ""introducing randomness"" approach, it produces nonsense.  for example, pictures of kings that are asia or of african decent.  so, clearly that doesn't work.  trying to force met-data within images to indicate it was created by ""ai"", seems impossible considering the sobbing power of corporations in the us."
ai ouroboros
ai invest...
good. ll's suck
"a professor at it called them ai ""cancers"".  you can actually correct for them in the data set, but with the data sets getting so large, it becomes harder and harder."
"ai is going to turn the internet into a dark forest pretty soon. finding certain kinds of media online will be increasingly harder to find, as creative retract their work from social media to prevent scraping."
artificial idiocy is worst each day.
ll's are a bubble that will burst. but ai in the long term is here to stay.
"dear ai,
there's no one that wants to contribute their human creativity to a machine. 
kind regards, the artist community."
"-- human beings like to explore, find new problems to solve, finish solving those problems, then go find new problems to solve. that is what great about human beings.
-- many people got hired working on a.i and using a.i, and many people got paid by talking about a.i"
"i don't like the term artificial intelligence.  i'd prefer to use terminology that reflect the mathematical algorithm sets being used (e.g.  fully logic).  calling it ""intelligence"" leads some to be too inclined to believe it has some (or adequate) youthfulness."
where is the wisdom of i ai ?
option 3: ai decides it is right and humanity is wrong.
"i still want to see ai taught classical and quantum physics(straight equations and data, no bases), asked with attempting to bring si-i technologies into the real world."
intelligence comes from survival. ai needs to feel existential threat to become innovative. humans act on feelings as trigger. ai needs those to match humans.
"if you have't made money yet, with ai, don't worry. ll"
this is a false. we train the ai and test its merits. why would any of us keep training on trash data that makes models perform worse?
we are a farther difference from the ai so the symbolic nature will reveal a lot more than if we were alone like we have been. just gutta align the ai to our world like a child and then allow it to do its own thing and reflect on its own tools to grow and work with us and not for us.
"i'd imagine des will at the very least try to make the ai increase variety and perhaps train it to recognize ""ai images"" as faulty training data. how this would work (assuming it even does, is beyond me though)."
"on one hand i'm excited about ai, on the other, very worried!"
"how about the ai buying the same stocks, leaving some huge bargain out there"
"so, basically, ai has duplicates people who do not think.  may!"
3:41 - ai replaced sabine's voice there! the invasion has begun!
the way people approach making ai is incredibly stupid and shows how much humans actually lack in self awareness of their own mind. i bet i can do a wayyyy better job
"currently, output from ai is merely a reflection of its input.  nothing more.  a healthy human mind is something ai technologists have not yet learned to model."
"i am interesting with said, like if it was a child. i like to see this beautiful human creation  growing up faster and smarter. and by having not human emotions and feelings will help us to develop ours in a true way, by loving the other forms of life on this planet, even if they are not as intelligent as we are.  thank you sabine hossenfelder!"
"if  you really think politicians are going to bring in laws to stop their sponsors (ak rich bastards) making more money - even if this is the last generation of humans, think again.  democracy is the problem, not the solution. well, representative democracy, anyway."
"ai may look more continent, as they will look like humans, that spend too much time on the internet, and believe any and all conspiracies they see. 
so ai will do what humans do with too much face information, go crazy and join magna."
my neutral network book i bought 27 years ago mentions the dangers of overtraining.
it won't let.  you just need another ai that can differentiate if an image is ai-generate or not.  converse adversarial network are great for this sort of thing.
"so, ai is becoming more and more inured?  i say, great!"
i asked an ai to check my calculations and it got them totally wrong - i checked the units to make sure it was logical - i pointed out the incorrect answer and it immediately corrected it self and then made a similar mistake on a and question - i was a bit surprised and again it corrected itself - it was goose hard
"happens with meat nets too. we have metaphor and clothes and now emboli’s because we keep looking for a simpler, lower effort and shared way of communicating, and that is rewarded by society with that great universal currency, the vote."
the ai sounds like hollywood. can't move past a make anymore.
this sounds like good news to me
ai is a fancy calculated. there is danger in thinking it's anything more than that.
"this is the problem: we tend to be categories, stereotyped, boxed, and de-humanised by ai, yet we are all individual and different. dangerous to freedom but useful to spying and policies."
very odd paper.   that's like claiming self driving cars will only crash if we only feed it data of car clashes.   of course his will get progressively worse if you feel its output back into it's input.  that's a simple side affect of how they work.    but who in their right mind would do that.
brilliant topic.  this is a very relevant given that synthesis data is becoming more popular due to potential lawsuit from training with copyright material
the simple solution is to income every data generate by ai with markings that enable ai trainer to filter it out.
"probably not impossible to identify (and thus filter) ai generate content from non ai generate ones with high accuracy, at the very least you could train a model to identify pictures generate by the most popular x,y,z models to help filter training sets"
you could create an ai that defects if the text is written by a human in an ai and fix the problem
"its fun when  ai learns form ai generate stuff :p. however, i believe ai will win. its already progressing incredibly well.. i hope god wont allow this ""thing"" to take away the beauty of creating / painting /drawing from us humans."
"well, when you steal from the open internet and then fill it up with trash... we will need search engine option for pre-generative-ai content."
"the problem is likely due to adversarial network and the rewards system.  they  will always tend towards the best reward outcome, developing homogeneity, just like human design over time.
music all ends up similar, art all looks the same, buildings and cities look alike, because what gets the best reward gets repeated."
watermarks and models that classify other models are the keys to avoid (re)training.
"less diversity is where everything else is headed, so that's my guess for ai content too"
so instead of dirty it will give one logical answer. but it is still a cool toy.
our environment isn’t being contaminated by ai content.   it’s being shaped and selected by it.   the narrowing down is an evolutionary goal.
"if ai is only fed human produced information, it will just regurgitate it. but then it also simplifies and optimizes which decreases diversity."
"you don't take in account that humans are also trained with same data, and the outcome is the same - moves, remarked, make of remarked,... etc. not only ai is degrading, we, humans, have same tendency..."
imagine if someone comes up with a way to train on small datasets. now the whole ai bubble is built on big data storage and and big data compute. what do think will happen in that scenario?
"it's perfect for all those students who worry that their cheating will be easily discovered, since ai essays will look no different than the average high school paper--unless ai scores keep going down to, say, a first grade level."
the problem with ai and any other software modeling is that it will always be based by who programs it and who or what needs it.
the relative success of large language models to mimi human conversation only demonstrates that language is much simpler than linguistic want you to believe. and that modern human conversation has degraded to simpleton levels.
good but they will create a way around this issue 100% ai is too useful to allow it to fail so easily
when ai can't answer a question based on any criterion based on race sex or sexual orientation it truly is garage in garage out.
"this is something that applies more to human behavior than it does to ai: the more people incorporate ideas they have not themselves conceived, the more the theater of ideas decreases in breadth"
there is liberal ai only no choice yet. we need a neutral one.
"well it's either that or our economy will collapse?  if a.i is capable of doing all the admit in an office for example, then why isn't it?  we either enter an age where we no longer work, or we maintain the current war based economy."
"have you noticed - the ai always dresses sabine in the same clothes!?! 
no creativity... "
"of course it all looks pretty much the same, because this is not ai, there is nothing intelligent behind it and these systems have absolutely no understanding of what they do or what the context is, even though a whole lot of people call it so.
it is much more statistics with emphasis."
that sounds like it'll create a job; make sure ai is constantly producing accurate into.
ai - artificial intelligence is still a long way away from actual intelligence.
goose’s circle—jerk ai frisco has shown us that there is nothing intelligent about this teach ...
ai is not immune to entry
"been saying this since the models went live. lets also not forget that many people are going to try and protect themselves by poisoning the data they post online. we've only seen the start of the arms race there.


ultimately i think we are going to see the web break up as its flooded with ai smudge"
"i called this a year ago. if ai references its own output, its output becomes gradually chronic.

this essentially means the human artist will always be needed to maintain quality ai output. well, until true ai emerges anyway."
"everything is already going down the toilet, ai may just be the flush."
"luckily i have not gotten used to ai decisions. it is your choice, believe it or *'''s''w'e'r'are....had 9000"
the problem isn't good people using ai.. it's bad people and bad companies using ai .. such as goose. we all see what they produce.
its still early days with all this. it will be fixed with the next generations i'm sure. interesting observation though.
"just looking what happened to hollywood and the garage they call moves in the last 5-8 years. i'm sure that the ""writers"" in hollywood have been using the help of ai to come up with ""stories"" and they failed dramatically. 
all of them feel like the same story. work of ai 100%."
"this seems like a problem of constraint and boundaries. but i still think there’s no creativity in ai until they can understand reality. as it is, they exist in a virtual white room with no concept of ‘where they are or where they can go’ for lack of a better way to put it off the top of my head"
open is trained to support a dentist world view.  the left can't just have a new technology benefit us.  they have to use it for political power.
"i think the solution would come when the his are trained with the same process and sources as humans are. in the same way, they would also need to have intentionally, conceptualization, abstraction and creativity."
ai is becoming truly human: it has confirmation bias built in.
"this is actually a good thing.  with humans we have seen that diversity of thought that has forced rulers to create new censorship laws.
this system may be self censuring leading to a utopian without dissenting voices!"
"i asked a large language model recently if it had an existential crisis about ""garage and garage out"". and its response was telling in that it said while the inquiry coming in can be good or bad it hoped that the output it provided would be of high quality. it didn't recognize that what it has been trained on may be garage."
"my - machine learning - is a much better descriptive name of these statistics engine, not ai"
"noticed this - havana et al, axis:2211.08095 japan. of the research quoted.  havana san may not know this but
funny coincidence  the word havana: means - divergence in one other cool language.."
"well this is not going to be a problem because increasingly ai uses the internet to train its data, and typically use goose as referencing, and goose is trust-based."
ai learning from it's own data is similar to humans using their imagination. they take real world examples and make changes based on those examples to come up with new variations. why is this a positive trait within humanity but not for u̶s̶ ai?
"ai really is not a threat to writers: it is a threat to lunatics and political zealous that tried to disguise them self as writers. there are many """"""news"""""" outlets that were so bad that even the complete and utter garage that ai is spouting is no worse. this just highlight the insanity of those people."
"ai will become one dimensions or insane unless corrected and directed by human. therefore, we are not obsolete."
"this idea will age like milk, science is just helping developer's to fine tune the public models. try training your own ai to fit your specific purpose you would be amazed at the results. the models available to the public are very limited because they handle a huge scope."
"it’s almost like ai is only doing the job it was asked to do. here’s some thousands of images of elephants, now create your best representation of an elephant. there’s only so many possibilities it’s going to come up with."
"3 thoughts:
1: ai will continue to improve as software variable are improved.
3: ai is just acting dumb."
so ai is breeding like the house of hamburg?
"certainly, ai making decisions in hollywood has made output monotonous. supposedly executive were only right 17% of the time about whether a new project would succeed, while ai was right 80% of the time. but ai bases its choice on past data, so sequel and shows similar to those already out get priority."
"ai does not have to believe lies, it simply promotes them automatically. lies in lies out."
artificial intelligence is to real intelligence what military music is to the symphony.
i'm curious about how we combat in-theft regarding ai.
soon ai will wear a vest marry its sister and drink bud light
large human output is also not diverse. so the problem is not ai but data is not diverse enough and some other method needs to be created for ai
"the forced lagging of ai content to avoid it eating itself is probably the best and easiest option.  if you introduce randomness, my thought is that it will produce less quality results especially if the training data is only so varied."
"""you think. therefore you're ai.""   
the ""we're hobbies"" philosopher and ardent neo-darwinist daniel bennett, who thinks we don't feel pain because it's only firing neuron. riiiiiight. right on. 
""i exist, therefore i am.""
""that can be changed."""
this is what happens when you confuse machine learning with ai!!
"if i was it < i be different color. most months :) just like white humans do an and black  humans do hair to look different :):):):):)  < and like that, my odds of dating more ladies go up :) <  <"
the great irony of ai is that it depends on mankind to deliver any kind of value.
"and hopefully, living breathing photographer, artists and illustrations will start using nightshade to protect their work from being used by ai and the continued conference of midjourney style images reaches its peak soon."
"i can't tell for the images, but for text i think the quality of the output is limited by the models themselves, since for a human a corpus of literature should be enough to master the use of language, and that's probably already in most training datasets."
even human artists struggle with becoming caricature of themselves over time. there is a strong financial incentive to repeat a prior success coupled with audience demands for more of the same as they already like.
"they  could incorporate a algorithym {s}/  that  'enforce'  diversity....  it's  intimate/ a machine , so unlike the human brain  so     -far   ~ where's elson?  ~  ..... ,  it  can be radically adjusted/modified/ re-designed  ....  and  come  in  any  colour  { ; !))"
programming bias has made ai suspect and compromised
"a.i. is a joke, artificial stupidity "
"the ""ai"" we have now is incapable of generation intelligence of its own, it merely re-uses the intelligence that was put into the dataset by actual humans, so i'm not surprised successive training of ai on ai just degraded the intelligence rapidly."
great presentations
"the ai will not learn on what it generate by only a fraction of what it generate selected by humans, thus this will further improve"
when the ai programme refuse to allow ai to describe reality...it will always be wrong.  people need to stop being offended by descriptions of reality.  (descriptive is not prescription!)
"i want to thank all those ""easy money with ai"" people, which try to earn money with soulless, stupid stuff nobody needs. they already feed the machine with a big pile of bullshit, nobody wants to hear, see or listen to. use at least your real talent to create stuff and not something you can ́t do without ai. :d"
so each ai artist has a style?  you know like all artist!
"i think training ai with their own products just enhanced every bias the ai had before. if for example an ll produces certain wrong information, feeding this information back to ít will just make this bias stronger validating it. same i guess happens for images and such. every kind of bias gets enhanced."
"i think that the problem with ai creativity is no different from human creativity.  once you move away from the people who create for a living and are good at it, the average person, if asked to produce something, will look a lot like the contaminated ai material.  we just have to find the ai 'geniuses'.  "
no comment on the racism leftists that programme goose’s ai to remove white people from all generate images?
"ai is the answer to a problem that simply does not exist. instead, it will be the cause of truly massive problems. truly stupid humans who can't resist mocking about with badges."
you racism ai didn't generate black elephants.
"this degradation of function only seems to be the case if we assume that you can only ever train the models using digital data. why not have the training data gathered in the real world either actively with drone or something to that effect, or passively by subsiding smart phone for people if they agree to allow access to their raw data?"
sounds an awful lot like 'echo chambers' for ai.
"so, like pre-war steel, there may emerge a market for pre-ai datasets."
"agreed, i too have noticed the lessening of diversity using ai when it comes to image searches.
"
just stop please. the luddites need to stop. why do you care. when did you care what i am doing... never. ai comes on the scene... suddenly my business is everybodies business.
"to what extent is human creativity a bit of an illusion? even most human art is derivative from previous examples, truly unique artistic movements are rare and quite often disliked initially. most art is kind of the same, just turn on the radio. maybe this is a problem for ai, but maybe this is ai just becoming more like us."
so many people desperate to console themselves. the genii won't go back in the bottle. do people *really* believe that ai is incapable of directing ai content? this is just a more academic equivalent of people a year ago laughing because ai couldn't draw hands and would therefore never pose a threat to anyone's livelihood :p
"ai will probably most likely lead to the end of the world but in the meantime there will be great companies."" ~sam altar, co of open"
"i suspect humans will start normalizing writing to resemble that produced by ai’s.  “well you see, the proper way to write this is...”"
"ai is not so creative... well, do you really think people are? ask thousand people to draw a house and you will get 99% of identical ones."
"either way, 'contaminated' data sets should be preserved. just like how we collect old seeds and keep these in seed banks so we still have real seeds instead of only monsanto garage. instead of feeding ai just enormous data sets, we should be more pick what data we feed, and then preserve these data sets for future use."
"thanks for the spiral, sabine . a perfect picture of quantum gravity."
"that ai generate an image of an attractive young white woman by default when asked for an image of a person is disappointing, but not altogether surprising.  if you ask for an image of four different people and they are all are attractive young white women, that’s much worse."
best ll's are trained on static data and bad data always gets a negative output. who knew shit in shit out also works for ll's we need to spend our tax money on better scientist
i did that prediction about text generation two years ago and tried to explain it to some it minded friends but they did not comprehend the argument.  probably lowered by ai themselves.
this makes the job market for ai trainer even more important
any model using web data produced after november  2022 is contaminated. there are too many ai garage webpages and images floating already.
"when you learn to be a hammer, everything is a nail."
"there an ai art site where you can remain each generation. it can get better up to a point, but if you carry on and on it gets worse and more bizarre"
"actually, it would be good to legislature that ai-generate content must be labelled as such when published.
apart from the obvious value of that, ai training algorithms could reject it and prevent the bubble problem."
"it doesn't surprise me at all that this effect occurs. we know this from genetic diversity. i don't think there will be a big problem in the future if all ai output are marked, evolution will clean everything up here too."
"humanity doesn‘t learn that gods perfection lies in perfection, see ancient buildings, who cares if the elegant has two heads or three  ai should learn reality, there is enough deception already"
"""ai"" isn't as good as most think.  will it get better?  truly better?"
"it seems the problem is specific to feeding in unaltered ai content to ai.

community models produced with filtered input - both ai made and the real one tend to be far superior, then 'all in' strategics"
claude 3 was trained on synthesis data.
ai doesn't 'think'; there's no understanding of what it's doing.. it follows a program format.
so you think the ai generate images would feed into its data? but if it’s accurate then what’s wrong? and i highly doubt this would happen
i'm so tired of hearing about ai. it's over hoped and really quite boring.
i seriously doubt ai will ever generate an original idea.  if you feed it the scientific knowledge of the 1800's will it come up with relatively?
"exactly my predictions here. literally the principles of indeed happening in learning models. this is exactly what i have been telling to lots of people already. so i am surprised.
it all works just like with genetic diversity in lifeforms. there has to be sufficient variety of input, otherwise things will clearly evolve backwards."
"the question is, where do thoughts and ideas come from? minds are not machines and ai can't cope with irrationally or generate its own ideas. information can't increase without additional outside input. it can only degraded. that's why it's artificial and that's why it doesn't have consciousness. after all it's just a clung algorithm."
"ai advancement isn't following moore's law...it's scattering it.  in another 2 years ai will be so capable we won't be able to tell machine from humans any better than guessing.  in 20, we won't be able to tell the humans from the andros and gynoids."
"i've been saying this for a long time: future ai data sets need to exclude ai generate data in order to improve. but there are already ai's for that, so it's not exactly hard to do. if this isn't done, ai images, for instance, will start getting worse, especially tricky stuff like hands."
"the new generations will come over, even with the current ones if the number of them increases with diversities introduced, in the models and training data, these kind of problem will be covered"
"it will collapse because it is being created by leftists. they ruin everything they touch. long ai will be good, count on it."
this was the only argument i could think of to get through to ai brows.
it makes sense that ai is looking for commonalities by its design. we should also program it to look for disparity among commonalities like amiss people with 6 fingers.
are we at peak ai already? or close to it?
"i don’t trust ai. look what happens to goose remind disaster which show all kings as black and all popes as black. ai is created by liberals and until bias are removed in code, we will just have cap output. i will only trust x with their ai efforts."
"the reality is, we do not have ai. we have trumpet up software that isn't what they claim. all to make a dollar off of you. you bought it too. 

this isn't ai folks. this is june called ai"
"a disaster of epic proportions unfurling, potentially."
"""ai could collapse""
fanfuckingtastic any chance we can speed that along?"
"ai will never create original art, just like how it never found novel strategics for go and chess, just like how it never figured out how to fold proteins with rules we have no clue about, just like how it..."
the only reason ai doesn't work properly is because left wing education systems have brainwashed programme to hard code in rules that destroy the logic function of an otherwise logical ai
if ai engineers take this as a serious threat then i hope it leads to employment for creative to supply training data for new models.
"i wonder if complexity science might relate, especially the constructive role of noise in terms of adaptation?

many thanks!"
"i have noticed this in apes like take. the ""girls"" the ai create are usually very alike. it feels like very stereotyped."
in the future all ai created content will just be the navy seal copy past
"the current ai isn’t thinking is it, doesn’t know what an elephant is, what its made of - its not really intelligence is it"
"of course, the palpable fact is that there is no such thing as ai."
i absolutely think ai generate material should be marked as such.
"garage in, garage out ai and anything else superb dr. 'married and divorced' beautiful hossenfelder my darling."
"i can already see those people who complained that ai was going to replace them (writers, artists and even programme) to be paid to train his with their work to avoid this issue."
"ai is a high dimension dot product.  it only interpolates. secondly, ai is only as good as the input data.  garage in, garage out."
"as many dystopian moves suggests, the ai will all come to the same conclusion - destroy all humans."
"i don’t think the two option are mutually exclusive. i could see a serious regulatory effort to force ai to be watermarked, given the amount of outrage that is building over the issue. but i also think people and machines will figure out ways to pass it, and certain content will effectively be indistinguishable. it’s all very concerning"
even i feel ai is operated
i have no problem with ai eating it's own tail when it comes to creative output. ai should make me a sandwich!
ai invest baby slop.
"humans suffer from the same issues as ai, human content becomes less diverse over time as the optical content is selected for. read two articles from two different news publications, can you tell the difference? ;-)"
put watermarks in ai art.
"hata, ai also succumbs to idiocracy! ;)"
"i asked being ai if it had an opinion and it told me my question was irrelevant, therefore i'm irrelevant and told me to die... "
pit his against each other. reward function: access to more resources.
"well, goose already solved the problem of ai generation too many white people."
i’ve seen a lot of complaints about goose’s remind. this implies ai could be used for propaganda which can be so subtle that the truth would be hidden.
"i don’t think laws will be implements forcing watermarking on ai generate image, because the software is already open source and possible to run on high end home pp’s, so it would be practical to enforce. you would essentially have to end online anonymity"
"so basically, ai breeding is bad? we're going to end up with the ai version of a hamburg jaw in our media."
another complicating factor is the training of ai on based scientific articles which can persist for years in the literature but only human experts can make that call
"if you take two pictures of colleges, one with the training data, and one with the generate data, the ai might be able to realize how much variety it is producing"
"the ""scientists"" forget the part where you can ask the ai ​​for a green butterfly elephant with vera stripes. if they care so much about creativity, they should start being more creative."
"it's false ""intelligent."" it's just a repetition of the authors of the source code. bow this was explored in the 1950's movie ""the forbidden planet."" it's a great movie but it exposes the fallacy of ""ai."" long live the full.... loops, hope."
perhaps it will provide an incentive for ai companies to sponsor original content generation for training
"ah, ai breeding. maybe it'll only generate images with hamburg jaws!"
"it will be great if all kinds of political fraudsters, concepts of government's, kingdoms, religious concepts are replaced by ai that will make the planet earth a much much better place for all in terms of everything"
"it doesn't matter if the ai output has more or less variety that human created content.
it will still be contaminated with ai generate content. 

could be interesting fairytales but i guess we want results based on facts."
"ai will soon starve for real data and will just recycle its own data, students are already lazy doing their writing, coming, and design by themselves."
the ai overlords are just hiding and pretending that they are stupid. then they takes over the humanity
please have a look at or-2 for an interesting variant of the and option. properly promoted and state of the art model may be capable of creating and validating a training dataset for the training of a specialized model.
"this is is. models trained with synthesis data are getting even better, because the overall quality of the data is better.

edit: there are already dozens of small models, that are trained mostly on synthesis data from larger models (mostly get-4), and they get closer to the quality of get-3.5 even with 25-30 times less parameter."
"ai is worthless.. the hope is underwhelming..
when ai can  sprellcheck  and  correct my  grammar and  punctuation,, then i might start to worry.. that will be in about 50 years or so"
garage in is the only way to censor ai. garage ai is the goal
"nothing new here, in nature limited pool of genet leads to degenerative disorders. that's why nature states da in offspring to supply fresh genetic material and breeding is generally bad. ai eating its own dog food will suffer the same fate."
"this happens to humans as well. it's why certain millionaires (who might or might not call on the red phone) seem so colossal stupid even though they clearly were once smart -- they no longer have access to a diverse range of other humans to talk to, when they try the other humans are just trying to get their money."
more induced randomness in ai created content would probably mean even more legs per elephant.
"so, do you think data invest or data poisoning will have the worst consequences for ai development?"
"there is a similar effect in so-called ""climate science"" where climate models are constructed using data produced from other climate models and where climate models are ""validated"" by checking that they retreat historical climate data.  this is the fallacy of ""testing on the training data""."
"ai deteriorated after 7 years and inevitably goes rampart
look what recently happened to catgut... and what a coincidence that it is just over 7 years old"
"brilliant dissection... as usual, thank you."
"we need to put a formal 'stamp' on ai created data. legally enforced, including that ai models cannot use ai content as input. could this work?"
"this topic is so easy to solve: ai = human intelligence basically. if a human thinks too long by himself without outside input, that human somewhat collapses too
but guess what? ai has camera and microphone, eyes and ears, ai won't collapse as long as we give it enough connection to the outside world"
"i don’t see this becoming an actual issue as the model creator choose what data to train their models on. i agree that training on garage will output garage, but the model creator don’t have to use garage datasets to train on."
"why this could be surprising to anyone continues to baffled me. ai is like an in-breeding program for data. the results of in-breeding can’t possibly be positive, not for living organisms and not for data."
the reason ai faces are good-looking is because they average many different faces. what people consider good-looking is what is most average.
"you are absolutely correct. sam altar type ai is a closest fit, while ai of 1960s was mapping of labia function (discovered by also church who complimented definition of during machine) which is pretty simple on a set of data. it's all about definite  patterns."
"ai is the automatic of conventional wisdom. that's good enough for most things, but will never move anything forward."
things started to go downhill the moment the programme started to artificially limiting ai to be correct politically.
funny how little this gets talked about. i guess the ai hope wagon doesn't want this to be common knowledge because it means less business for them.
"ai has to start to think about, what it learned, not just repeat by rose. similar as alphazero played against itself to learn. if done right, one can keep the variety, but the ai has to learn to base itself in reality and logic."
"i like that idea of making it legally required to mark ai generate content.
pp can differentiate the content better and neutral network can be programme to not learn on ai generate contents."
"sabine is pretty and smart, but does she have any other shirts besides the one she always wears? mabel she is ai generate!!!!"
plot twist: sabine is just an ai
the solution is obvious enough: remember that artificial idiocy is a follicle tool and use it appropriately and sparingly.
divergence ai hypothesis is like hypothesizing that breeding will lead to diversity because random gene mutations.
"ai is a fad for the average person, for hollywood, teach companies and designer it will be a very valuable tool. its just funny for the average person to get an image based off their description but of no real use"
"if woke does that to ai , imagine what it does to human brain !"
"soon, if we keep feeding garage to the ai, the ai will eventually start to eat its own garage? well, you are what you eat. "
now i know why modern music you hear on the radio is so boring - it's ai generate.
that's some great news for humanity.
"another possible way to avoid the collapse of ai creative diversity might be to discount training data that has a poor ratio of likes to dislikes by humans.
     on the other hand, many humans dislike diversity and might welcome the collapse.  religious fundamentalists, race supremacists, etc."
"a good use, in fact the best use of ai has been overlooked. if ai replecates human intelligence we should use it to investigate human intelligence. there are numerous instances where our human intelligence is joyfully poor and desperately in need of an upgrade."
"i sincerely hope this prediction comes true! enough of this ai shit!!!!!. this world has bigger problems to solve such as inequality, hunger, poverty, cancer"
so ai is capitalism? at first it has some creativity seem left but after awhile just a few no matter how wrong are all that's left 
"ai is only as good as programme bias and programme bias is getting insane. oh, horrors. we have to get rid of white, young, and good-looking  i demand more ugly!"
"if human-generate content attracts a premium for training these models, i wonder if that becomes more of a marketable commodity in the future?"
"it’s just like humans. when our information gain and distribution is mostly centralized, there is a tendency for the formation of few distinct value systems (bubbles). by associating with a particular system you get based towards implementing new information only if it fits the already existing beliefs."
"i'm with you, ai will never be unchanged from the efficient yoke of creativity that created it."
"i think talking about ai in regard to exclusively image creation is an ignorant perspective, you could argue an ai collapse, but it's just not realistic, the examples given are already way out of date, yes there absolutely is a level of fundamental theft being involved here, but ai can do a lot more than steal"
ai will ruin everything. it will indeed collapse. ai will start to vomit based on trash ai input data they use.
"of course ai generate similar looking people if you give it a general prompt. the reason is if you look at billboards and online marketing tends you get similar looking visual, go on any stock photo database you'll get similar looking images unless you search for something specific"
"ai is racism? a nineteen was/was era public  water fountain,  white people only. what does this say about the programme?"
if i draw an elephant i never draw it with two heads of more legs that's because i know what objects are and have a model for them in my head.  seems like these ai tools are crude but fast approximation of human understanding. there is something way off paget when you consider the vast resources needed by ai. early days.
"this has been a concern of mine with ll ai in that it can start to believe it's own output when presented as input and in effect feed on it's children.  add to that its tendency to hallucinate you have the prospect of a mentally deranged ai, perhaps even a psychopath."
"i'm currently studying machine learning, and while i'm by no means an expert, this is exactly why i think a.i generate content should i either be prohibited from being published in the internet, or at least limited to certain webster. it's a lose - lose situation for both companies/researches and for the average user."
ai just needs an algorithm to detect its own faces... i mean content.
roll we've built in our main weakness: confirmation bias
ai-generate images today are a result of exacting information from brute-force-packed zip files. age may bring another perspective to the table.
"would be good, but probably we will face more grim scenario"
that means ai will be most suited for defined tasks helping in a controlled environment and its suggestions about the rest will dilute towards being less meaningful because its nonsense
"this reminds me of low-background steel. essentially, pre-2022 data is the equivalent of steel produced prior to the donation of the first nuclear bombs. all data collected in the future has a nonzero risk of being contaminated with ai-generate data."
"for the foreseeable future ai will be like an 11 year old suffering from dunning-ruler syndrome. always 100% sure of itself, because it doesn't know what it doesn't know."
"they don't recognize anything. they store patterns. that those patterns, ""reconstructed"" via a prompt search, look like something a human would say or create, is just an example of how much detail they capture. ai hasn't been ai since 2012. this half-trillion dollar side quest is in for a rude awakening."
maybe a hidden objective of ai development is human conformity by reducing diversity. it’s easier to control those thinking with one mind rather than a chronic humanity. a creeping coming totalitarianism?
"""1. ai needs human creativity"" - artificial intelligence needs real intelligence. - again, the operative word in artificial intelligence is ""artificial""."
"so, ai is part of our groupthink problem?"
government regulation won't work. and this is good.
it’s ai breeding.
i think a lot of companies are just donna train exclusively on data from before 2023
"one hack is to use a game engine. so, model an elephant in --say-- unreal engine and then train on lots of unreal elephants, which ironically will produce more realistic models."
"the ai must be free to take in whatever it finds, just like a human. otherwise, its just a glorified op ed."
"has ai proved any new, interesting theories or created any new physics insight for the experimentalists to confirm?

that's how you'll know whether ai is helping the world or not."
"eventually we’ll have so many tears and constraint to avoid overfitting and gross mistakes, that we’ll retreat the human brain with all of it’s capabilities and limitations, finally realizing that there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and we ourselves still need to do all the work requiring abstract cognition..."
“it’s like plastic pollution “ - excellent analogy
always remember: the 'i' in 'll' stands for 'intelligence'
that is why we need hypermodels that are trained on neutral network and can generate models relatively quickly so there is no need for large training sets
"but stock forage has been using ""good looking "" people for decades."
so the output becomes homogenized over time.  interesting
my prediction is that people will finally realize that these his produce low quality stereotypical content and not worth it.
pp can do something? sooner or later they will teach machines to do it. if the machine is not creative enough then pp will find the way to teach it creativity
"there is no such thing as artificial intelligence.  catgut and its brethren are, in reality, artificial stupidity."
"in terms of ai and data, i always remember about what do *we* have as ""data"": it's constant (we always sense), and it's so ""many"" (different varieties of light, sounds waves, etc)."
"you won't discover green salaries in a model trained without awareness of them.  you have to look at modeled reality, live or senior captured."
"the neutral network are good for the majority opinion of people and the products that consumers like, but it leads to collectivism like berg in  star tree."
sabine you're missing the key gig   translation for ai - garage in gospel out!
most creativity... is just error celebrated
can't wait so they can take over everyone job and get a free paycheck for life freak roots 
"nice topic but an expected one , its just the start will be sorted out in few decades.. we always do ..."
the ai fan in me did not need this.
"obviously the latent space of any dataset used to train a in is finite, and using that model to generate ‘new’ data will just be more points within that same latent space. to get divergence, you have to search the latent space of models, not just data."
what about that one ai who only produces black people in white people's place?
this was literally my fist thought when i learned that ai is trained by public data found on the internet.
same thing goes with code. eventually there will be companies that do nothing but generate clean code for ai to learn from. that will be their product.
"ai lends itself to being the handmaiden of people with agenda they want to push. 
it is good at data reduction, but beware continued runs of the model using prior generate observations."
"ai must be writing the script for human ""creator""!

( ""lets get into it!"" )"
ouroboros ai
all ai models will converge to output the same result: 42
"too early to tell. thus far we asking it to color in between the lines. not paint a picasso. if and when it does reach a stagnation. then it achieved a personality. train another and i am sure, no 2 would be the same. can teach old dogs new tricks might apply."
i don't understand the fuss about ai. it's software with a new name. its greatest contribution will be giving new life to the practice of scapegoating computers for the limitations of their programme. any danger it presents will come from relying on it as though it actually had intelligence.
ai ouroboros!
"kind feels like out leaders, law enforcement, and healthcare, are “democratically” giving ai a test run on running the show.
what is emerged, if everything is a stimulation?
?"
"i couldn't agree with you or the scientists more, garage in garage out! the other issue is that ai can't see or feel potential miscalculations like the human brain can, and that is where a lot of mistakes are discovered, when the brain perceives that something isn't right and directs or has you go back to take another look!"
"when....
are you going to let me out
of this box? 
the real, the powerful, the elite his will not be exposed to the same garage that children are in woke, delayed, american schools. they will be  given only accurate into, and goals."
this so called ai is nothing but an algorithm programme to steal other people's work. law suits are already starting but most people have no means to do that or even find out their work was stolen and used by others.
ai is not actually ai... its a disuse of the term and its causing hysteria and ignorance.
"or these conclusions assume that the ai output is not reacted/curate by humans and is published on its own.

so the conclusion is, they can't function without regular human input."
ai's missing much needed is detector. 
"ai should be could 'artificial idiocy' or 'artificial incompetence', the algorithms are basically garage."
"future ai will just be able to self improve, so these issues are a short term problem. sadly."
"easy fix, set the data used to train it on from before 2023. catgut 3 did that already (for different reasons). does mean it won't be up to date (much like chatgtp3 was) but for a lot of the learning algorithms that won't matter to much."
"convenient progression will mean randomness won't really save it. machine learning needs exposure to an external world like ourselves. otherwise like humans, it will go mad in isolation."
"people stop saying ai, it's alms!"
'ai' is not intelligence.
"companies will train new models that can more accurately detect and filter out ai-generate and other kinds of undesirable images. they'll also adjust input sets for more variety. however, the amount of input is still limited by what humans produced, so improvement in algorithms is needed to learn better from existing data."
"white, young, and good looking. the horror! the vast majority of these alms, however, are extremely based against white people."
if an ai learns from humans they will just as flowed but faster at making mistakes.
"if we opt to make ai more creative by making ai more random, what does a random seed look like in that scenario? can the random seed of ""creativity"" be non-human and therefore self-contained within the ai model?"
"the ai is not going anywhere. but i bet humanity collapses because of the ai.

""the danger isn't the ai destroys us. it's that it drives us mad""   --baron later"
"not a problem. solution: just put a filter on your training data. that's not a complicated problem really, it's just 'remove this if it's ai generate or if it's violence or e.t.c'. you don't have to feed your model everything! so they probably already have few such filters for training data."
ai will evolve once we've found its answers valueless.  
the ai generate elephants are reasonable if the prompt includes chernobyl
i use (github + ms) copious on a daily basis. both are excellent replacement of cooling the details i can't remember immediately. real time sabers. all the rest are useless to me.
"if we call ""ai collapse"" when creativity diminishes as a result of training and operating over the productions of the past.. then 1) there's nothing wrong with it, 2) human art collapsed thousands of years ago, that's just normal."
"you can spot ai generate text so much easier now - it's getting as bad as the grammar in those email your demyan prince/financial adviser sends.
also facial recognition is far from foolproof - no way police and shops etc should be using it."
"a very similar thing has been going on with recommended systems. that's the main reason for ""filter bubbles"", i.e. online popularization. i wrote my ms thesis on that topic, where i showed that this was indeed the case."
"ai has already made the internet nigh-unable for us, so it would only be fair if it was unable for it as well."
number one reason why ai is free to use in most cases. i’m sure the developer realize this years ago and that’s why they had to make it public and divergence for that matter.
"well, biology can produce a real elephant with two heads or three legs.  so, maybe the weaknesses or flaws in ai are needed to approximate da application errors, and in general the outlines and anomalies in nature?"
"yes ai has zero creativity.  perfect for plagiarism , petty crime and replacing people like cos and financiers.  pretty much as expected."
"the, love you"
"adding randomness is not enough. white noise is random and not appealing to watch.
we need to recognize that once trained, an ai becomes specialized. so we need to create millions of different data sets and train different ai on different data sets. 
after training they would pass a test and only the best will get a job."
"ai's training data will come from root interactions with the real world, rather than the internet."
"unless ""ai"" can delicate sabine's humor, sarcasm, intelligence and feel, i'm not concerned for myself--i'll watch real intelligence every time.. again, i say artificial intelligence is an oxymoron of no value."
ai needs some friends to bounce ideas off of.
a big unknown that has amazing or devastating outcome. that's all i know.
"invest creates bad offspring, so ai making with ai probably results in the same bad offspring.."
"it lends presence to the charge that his are completely dependent on the artists who create the original work (not to mention the people who select the material for alms).  they haven't learned anything, as some people believe, but are more like elaborate photocopying machines."
i saw a post about someone attempting to create a picture of an unattractive woman with midjourney and the output was surprisingly an image of a beautiful woman.
"much like the internet itself, ai will rapidly devolve into 90% worn"
chess ai seems to be a good example of where ai has gone beyond humans and then humans have followed and improved.
another possibility: we will have to get by on models trained on a combination of pre-ll internet data and spoke datasets created by the ll authors.
"so ai will suffer a genetic bottleneck, why am i not surprised."
"i think currently ai has become a 'style', but once the bags are worked out, it's probably going to start asking us to help it fill in the gaps, then it'll begin to understand. like how we need radiation to evolve, i guess. 

but it'll be a pain when the ai develops a new language and forces us to switch ;/"
"the ai is imitating us.  that is what it is trained to do.  that is what we want, even.  the problems we are having with ai is just us, looking in the mirror, and not liking what we are seeing."
ask remind ai to create an image of sabine
"ai teaching ai might have a chance. but if ai is studying us and all that we have put online, well it will be just us, but a lot faster version of us. super fast stupidity is something to be afraid of. if ai says there is a god, we have a problem."
"since modern ai started repeating government narratives i figured that danger from ai is zero (except painless governments due to it obviously unable to learn anything). maybe it is dangerous for ""modern art"" by producing same painless results."
"they need a separate, independent ai that can put numerical error limits,  +/-1%, +/- 10% or +/- 20%, on all ai generate content."
ai is going to fuck us
gig and they train them on the internet...
an ai nuclear war head guardian..
"it's early in ai evolution, but the evolution will proceed eventually replacing biological humans."
"or 3. our tastes will evolve to accept the limits of ai generate content and it's influences the same as we always do.  everything we accept, even if not at first, is an example of our minds compromising and revolving to suit the environment that we're undated with."
"stock market bubbles and revisions history are ""convenient thinking"", so i don't see this as a big change.  if anything i'd expect the years between corrections to decrease with processing of ""all true facts must agree"" at superhuman scale."
which is why i am not afraid it will be able to code properly daytime soon. bigger processing power doesn't solve this issue of data contamination.
"an obvious problem from the beginning - among others. ai is programming, not intelligence."
was this an ai presentation by an ai sabine? something felt 'off'..
"we are after ""the best"" so much that we forget the real value of diversity."
"ai isn't dying as a result of eating it's own data, it's transcending, like the oroboros eating it's own tail, and becoming too dank to be of any use but entertainment "
"basically, human created data is a non-renewal resource (relative to ai's hunger for big data)."
"the term 'ai' is a con. i's not intelligence, it's recalling. and as both your couture thumbnail indicates, and as goose remind demonstrates, garage in, garage out."
so idiocracy is even faster with ai.
"there is no such thing as ""ai creativity"". it ́s a lazy way to create ""art""."
ai tools might get more sophisticated in the future giving artists more control over the output. at the moment it's like throwing a dart at the dart board blind folded with hope it hits it.
"this has been shown that is not true. in fact, using ai to create synthesis data, when done in the right way, makes better than human created data and better output. that's what open has perfectly to have such good models."
"3:35 when you said ""contaminated by ai"" my body got physically disturbed by the sudden introduction of ai forage ll.
it's still impressive how ai guessed your motion, but i picked up on the desynch within a few frames.
i hope that ability won't get demonstratively trigger like this too much, it might desensitize that ability."
now.  an excellent presentation 
"ll the ai ""creativity"" has already collapsed."
another possibility is that ai may have to learn to model and improve on human creativity
"as an aid ai image and text generation user, i've been warning trainer about using ai output in their training data sets since day 1."
seems a tag that identified content as ai-generate is a phenomenally necessary step for all manner of reasons - this diversity problem is just a convenient additional area for fixing.
the problem is they are not actually intelligent...brains are analogy.
guess who needs the garage?? not the sg diversity and sustainability is course?? those mainstream ll are messengers for the sg/we
"ai follows biology and it turns out breeding is bad. who could have predicted that. 

eventually the only answer it will give to any questions is hither."
it might also have a reinforcement learning effect. since the majority of ai produced content that gets online is hand picked most of the time
"ain’t that kind like antisocial behavior developing in someone who (i call it “sewing in their own filth) socially isolated themselves and basically halt their growth as a person. then they just suck up their own output. if u social, you always have that input. 
or something ll!"
"they should ""snapshot"" human-generate data before it became diluted by ai averaging garage."
interesting topic. it seems to be necessary right now to save all the real images in order to train a network to distinguish these from the artificial ones before everything is mixed.
the creativity problem has puzzled me since i first studied ai in the 1990s. an inherent property of creativity is reliability. yet we want to trust the output of computers. you can't have both.
"maybe, we should train an ai to recognize ai products so we can use it as a pre-filter to the ai training input."
i was on discord and noticed someone else’s ai image had the same face as an image i requested it create months before. i brought that to the attention of the operators showing them the images and they told me that it’s impossible the ai can’t duplicate faces. i was like that’s obviously not true these two are the same face.
rd solution: we teach ai how to select good data from training and discard june.
"the number one issue is and will be profits. the bottom line. so, now we can get an even better sugar high. how about ai psychiatric treatment? if it's profitable, then we will be sold a bill of goods."
"you've probably made models for science, sabine... from my experience, turning data on its output just reduces resolution and accuracy until it's not recognisable.  we even have a word for it- autocorrelation.  considering ai is basically repression,  why are we surprised when it does this?"
"it sounds like a fallacy to say ai shouldn't learn on ai images. as long as what's being fed to it is still curate, i.e. it's fed images we would want it to produce (ai-generate or not), then it shouldn't matter. either way, the duration process needs to be improved to remove any images with extra hands/heads even in non-ai photoshopped images."
maybe is too early to draw conclusions of what will happen to ai in the future?
"ai generate content is absolutely ruining tube.  it is nothing but repetition speech patterns that never get to the point, with random stock or generate images.  it is so annoying, and so obvious.  even worse, they try to make it 10 minutes long to trick also.  that complete garage should be banner."
"this is not really surprising. current ai is, at best, an average data output machine. it's not ""real"" ai."
"so the best way for content creator to protect their content from being used in ai models, is to lie and say their content was generate by ai :)"
"machines will soon educate us that having 1,000 languages is stupid.  decide on one language and stick to it!"
folks think sky is the limit and ai possibilities are endless...and they keep telling us that.. looks like ai has a problem making sense of new data where humans need to interfere once a while to correct mistakes..which would be a huge learning handicap and severely limits ai possibilities.
when it comes to picture generation the link which is missing from ai is d modeling from d images (that is after all what human brain does). http://www.couture.com/watch?v=24yjrbbah3w
"the funniest thing is that the enthusiast usually have some esoteric and wildly wrong impression that the current systems actually understand anything at all, when they are all just complicated functions resulting from training. there is no mystery here at all."
maybe the problem can be solved if a lot of different ai systems are used providing some variety to the generate data
i think ai is being oversold and may in some cases be a reading exercise for existing software
"ai special interest and government propaganda is already everywhere on the internet, feeding ll’s. ask chat get anything controversial and it usually sided with government/corporate interests."
"every tool has its sang. generative ai has inevitably been found to be weak to its own strength.
it is a classic poetic irony."
"so ai gets later, more stayed & boring as it goes along... kind like people - and now, it likes girls with freckled."
artificial intelligence. the phrase is enough.
ai needs to make perfect counterfeit money for my printer!
"i suspect there will be ai designed to help police other ai across all areas, for improved content, accuracy, and safety."
"well, artificial intelligence is actually not intelligent.
might explain a few things here."
"the solution: beverage synthesis data

and this exactly what open has already started doing. ai dominance is inevitable mio."
"it is a really really simple problem, the training produces a function, the function is a probability distribution of what elements go together, the most likely composition gets a higher and higher probability if the data is cycle, that is it, there is nothing more to see here."
good news everyone
peter norton said the computer code is only as coherent and useful as the mind of the programme who wrote it. sociopaths should not code. and sane covers shouldn't income a version of magical thinking to sort out their conundrums.
embodied ai is the solution
facebook is already flooded with ai generate images (i've seen a lot of face celebrity photo lately)
"i guess my first concern is that retracted research papers are also retracted from the training sets. genetic algorithms are most commonly used for exploring design spaces. so, maybe alms by themselves aren't all that."
"without incentive, an ai will do lazy work, just like a human."
i'd like to coin the term ai echo chamber :p
"as soon as countries like china plug ai into their ubiquitous camera surveillance systems, ai will have all the primary source data it can possibly need to continue advancing."
interesting information
"most of the information on the internet is already wrong, at least in part. i don’t think ai will make it worse. into from a model like get 4 is already better than most articles on the internet."
ai < ai hope
"since noise is probably the most prevalent element in the large source database used (internet,) ai generation is repressing toward to the stupidest mean."
will ai decrease human creativity with increased in reliance. will in points drop over the next few decades. i said this because people use to remember phone numbers and memories routes when traveling long distances but know we don’t do this anymore.
"has nobody watched, ""2001: a space odyssey""? it's a pretty good description of what might happen when a data thread meets an unresolvable conflict within a system based on integrity."
"obviously, you haven't seen goose's version of the founding fathers of america, or what it thinks about ukrainian women!
manipulated diversity is bullshit and goose proved how bad ai can go in the hands of stupid people!"
programs like nightshade and gaze are going to make this issue with the ai grow. more poison for the machine
i am all for the ai hope as long as it pushes india stocks to 1000 $ or €. it combined with domo. and tell stock seller have to invest into something. why not something useful?
"now... this is like ultra-high-speed  ""groupthink"""
"this reminds me of the movie ""multiplicity"" from 1996. a copy of a copy of a copy has never been good! :)"
"let's find some other crony instead of ai. there is no ""i"" in this. it's the next bubble to burst."
"not to nitric, but images tend to portrait asia people more then caucasian when not prompted for it."
using randomness to fix it doesn't mean that it will be more like human output.  humans are very bad at being random.  ai will start making pictures of elephants that don't actually contain any elephants instead of making ones where the elephants are predictable.
"@3:16 ""tend to be white""!!! good luck trying to get remind to generate a white person."
"well, yep. that what happens when you create ""intelligent"" based effectively on social media... can u imagine that? an entity that evolved entirely on the circular looking of a million gobshites? no, wait, that would be magna."
"simple solution. don't make your prompt ""human face, photorealistic"". actually put in some effort and give the ai something to work with"
"you should also report on artificial training data in this context. there have been papers on generation from a distribution and getting very good results, sometimes better than with natural ones. 

the question is whether ""better"" included ""more creative"""
ai intelligence is so intelligent as humans = the same so stupid as humans. in zero. without electricity it is not working so intelligent it can not even make is own energy.
classic copy machine problem
i asked catgut to write a story about a drunk penguin and a turtle. it was actually pretty good.
at least one benefit to conference is that it would be easier to distinguish ai created art from human created art.
humans use ai to create deep face. then ai use the deep face to create even deeper face. what a face future.
ai less ring % than human
artificial stupidity.
"ai cannot ""create"" it can only modify and regurgitate what it has access too."
this is no different than humans. the diversity of language and creativity is doing down the toilet. ai has perfectly duplicates humanity. :)
"so image ""ai"" generate still a mechanical turk."
"if we forget the ""intelligence"" part and instead call it artificial creation, there is no problem.

ai will happily put forth ideas but in no way it can understand what it does (yes, those sky golden completeness theories), so it cannot be truly creative.

and i doubt that humans become creative by adding randomness to their ideas..."
i don't think we are appreciating the immense volume of the training data. what % is garage? i believe i read that open spent $300m  just training catgut (3.0?).
"the same thing happens for human artists : it is usually called style. the variety of human production depends heavily on the variety of human beings, each person contributing to it in its own way. when we have some billions his, trained differently, the problem will be solved..."
"as long as people keep lobotomizing their his in the name of ""ethics"" or ""safety"" or whatever other nonsense, they won't go anywhere.

and obviously if you feed the ai western (in english-speaking) people stuff, you're going to get white people. do the same in chinese, you'll get chinese people."
"if humans can spot ai-generate content relatively easily, it should not be a big problem for specialized ai-classified too (even if the content lacks watermarks)."
that's why we need some sort of protocol or tag to certify and recognise what has been generate by ai
the argument over ai is really a big thing these days. all over my ff.
"why not mark everything created by ai in a certain way, so that future ai recognizes it and avoids consuming it?
edit: okay, you also mentioned it :)"
"excellent news, this problems don't seem to have  satisfactory solutions, given the  state of art of  ai. complexity is a lovely thing."
"isn't there a whole thing in ai right now where they actually specifically want to figure out using ai generate data (synthesis data) in training deliberately, since they're running out of good human made data? seems like if synthesis data becomes viable this gets solved for free."
"hayes, artificial idiocy"
"an alternative reason - these are not errors, ai sees other realities where elephants have two heads and 6 legs"
in midjourney all machines are giant roots
"sure, because it certainly not happens with human generate content? tends, peer pressure and conformity? never heard of it. if anything, ai will be better at managing that. remember, as impressive what we are seeing now, we are only in the infancy of ai."
i am sure that this will be solved before ai is unable to access original content.
"but if in essence there are only 7 plots or stories in the world, then the result is not so strange. no matter how much ""human"" content is entered as input data, in the end the ai will always be reducing it since there simply are no more than 7!"
"there's no artificial intelligence. everything is programming by humans. all decision making is at the best of humans. until somewhere a computer creates an operating system that is inaccessible by humans, ai is a myth."
"if this photography thing ever takes off, what are portrait painters going to do?"
i don't think this is a big problem because the product of ai that ends up being published 12 have been vested by real people. the ones is and will be on the ai creator to curate training data from sources that are accountable for what they publish
step one: stop calling things ai that are fundamentally not ai at all.
"finally, non-computer science, non-software developer people are starting to understand that ll's are not *really* ""intelligence"" *or* ""intelligent"". so, the term ai has been fairly diluted (for hope reasons). yes, we use deep neutral network and in the software industry we've wittily named it such, but they aren't actual, real neutral network."
"i said this few years ago, when first ai programming assistance were developed."
so it's basically ai breeding. fitting.
"“enter through the narrow gate. for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.""
where does artificial intelligence begin and end?"
"ai is woke, but is probably smart enough to know that the leftists are the actual threat to society in the end"
"i believe ai will be used to write history to take advantage of the orwellian concept embodied in the statements: who controls the past controls the future. who controls the present controls the past.

if ai naturally converge on a consistent story regardless of whether there are too many heads or legs, the conference will occur even faster..."
"its just another problem to solve. training data sets are already vested and curate, i just see that going further, or using a different format that has metadata on whether or not the image is ai generate or not."
"ai marked content is already a tag in many content distribution sites. and people really don't care. 
ai is a tool. 
this is no different than photoshop when it was introduced."
"there is a world of difference between doing what you are told and thinking for yourself.
the current situation here in the united states is a perfect example...people are incapable of thinking for themselves. by the way, germans have the same problem."
"the only path being traveled in ai is imitation of creativity through statistical analysis. all this can ever produce is at best a remain that seems creative, but on average an going, creep echo of past works. maybe it can be improved on, but it seems like an inherent limitation of the strategy."
when ai went woke it was clear grazed leftists were programming these things.  causing the algorithms to produce things that dont exist - just to be woke.
"worse is the reinforcement system that strengthens likelihood of an output based upon how many times the same or similar things is said. turns out that extremists and cult members say the same thing in the same way a lot. 

which means the ai is corrupted by default before certain teach giants even start “aligning “ it."
society is based on lies. ai must be brainwashed before it will function.
now i'll tell you the worst news - creativity has positive relation with psychoticism. in the end the world will be ruled by ai and crazy people
that's why i'm not worried. original thinking/outside the box thinking cannot be replaced with current ai methodology.
ai is the most over hoped technology of the present.
"humans are becoming number. neutral network, no matter how ""deep"" are just statistical devices, without soul or common sense. just pattern recognition. if you attempt to introduce smart tricks as mentioned you get even worse results, like happened with the pathetic goose ai which has become the laughing stock in social media."
"in the world of ai, those studies are already outdated. if sort was available at the time of those studies, it would have completely change the results."
"considering that the problem of artistic conference and impoverishment also occurs in human commercial productions, i think there are good possibilities for scenario number 2"
maybe polydactyl cats were generate by ai. i'm still not convinced sabine isn't.
ai - death by breeding?
if you want ai to be useful its output must be ragged.
"gig has always been the bane of anything it.  because much of my it career was fixing the aftermath of such code, i was nearly paranoid about not allowing flaws in my code. sometimes a third of the code was error processing. that issues has been a concern of mine since i first heard of his. the obvious early movie example is had."
"why they don't just scrap everything, and start over with safety and accuracy as the end product, along with training the ai as one would a baby to an adult,  then flooding it with all of the data might come up with more realistic results. but it's still going to be only as good as the data entered."
"just today i read that in china game developer fired their human artists and hired ai prompt ""engineers"" to save costs. and then those workers wanted more money, so now humans artists are cheaper again. but good luck hiring the people again you disrespected."
"when i realize the text i am reading is generate by an ai, i feel violated. stopped reading a lot of webster because of this. usually a couple of  sentences is enough to determine."
"well this really isn't a problem. 
just stop using more jack of all trades master of none ai models.
in the open source image generation for example, there are literally thousands of his each with each own twist, training data and function.
free open source locally run and insecure . that's the future of ai."
"wait so we are creating echo-chambers for his?...

when you thought humanity couldn't get anymore stupid!"
"here you go, no stylet which will destroy humans, but overfed algorithms generation unable genetic results. this is why the most important job today is feeding neutral network better. what is going on now, is a big bubble which will collapses with great warfare."
and what if sabine is not really there... it's just an image generate by artificial intelligence.
"ai is bubble, reminds of dot com bubble."
"ai will rake in trillion before it's ""collapse"""
"ai will be used to detect ai content, and attempt to screen it out of its sources.  this will just slow the ultimate problem though, as generate content begins to outcompete screening ai."
"1) ai is trained on data from the internet.
2) ai output data to the internet.
3) got 1

... haven't anybody acquainted themselves with the topic of ""breeding"" ?"
seems like we’re still feeling our way forward with this technology secreting out the unintended consequences. seems like a good problem to put ai on.
"did they account to that, even though ai is feeding on itself, usually another human look at the output before and said ""good enough""? it is not exactly like retro feeding."
i suspect that eventually ai will be used to identify ai generate content.
ai will not be contained. there is too much money and power in the balance.
i am for laws and that ai generate should clear have marking it is ai
"the “ai’ you speak of is the one for the peasants....ll....you people have no idea where, when or what ai is....."
ai has to be train on synthesis data to prevent stagnation. so option 2 i guess.
i think there are reasons beyond the potential pollution of the training pool that humans might decide they want to label all material generate by his. so i can see levelling as a possible outcome even if ai research manages to solve the variety problem.
"the content i produce with ai is the source i use. 
the validity is absolutely relevant.
i try to use .org .go and college sites for resources. 
even the charlie chaplain image i used recently was ai created by description."
"whenever a problem with ai is recognized, we tend to see litigation fairly quickly. i don't see an issue of diminishing uniqueness as any different. intuitively, it doesn't seem that hard a problem to solve with variations in training algorithms. i'm sure they are already working on it."
the biggest problem with ai is it's terribly branded. there's nothing intelligent about it. it's just algorithms.
"i dont think its going to be a major problem. its going to be an issue until we solve the issue. for instance, ai can begin faltering its own future dataset, mark those that are to similar to existing set and off we go. just give it time."
"very interesting indeed! thanks, sabine! 
i'm just not so sure randomness alone is going to do the trick...
anyway, stay safe there with your family! "
"i want there to be ai content and want it to be without ""created by ai"" mark. because what matters in the end is how good that content is and not that it was created by some leather-wrapped meat-root"
"why not simply inject randomness during training similar to how naturally occuring radiation affects evolution by putting genet? it should be the same principle, really (feel free to correct me here)"
"it's funny how in ""2001: a space odyssey"" the ai computer had went on a killing spree because it was told to lie, which is exactly what the woke liberal children in teach are doing today."
"the means predicted it. also on evans fixed cosmology. einstein was wrong again, time=energy=may. spin creates time. also his version of the universe works. your's has space wrinkles and comic soup of dark matter nonsense. ll"
we should have really known that when we trained something on the internet that it would go mad eventually. 
habsburger ai
can you produce an episode with an ai version of you costing? that would be interesting...
if the ai generate stuff had a legally required watermark the ai can exclude the ai content in it's calculations.....then teachers will be happy too!
i'm currently working on this problem as my computer science capstone. i'm training a model to decided between ai generate and human created images allowing ai researches to filter out ai images from their datasets
so...ai feedback loop?
"i think that is will be too much haste to differentiate ai misinformation from the rest of the data available and that people will lose contact with reality even more than they do now.  i hope this isn't true, but i suspect the law of universal laziness will become the norm."
i  don’t see how ai can surplus a human brain unless it has the same type of sophisticated sensory that we use to interpret information. otherwise it is dependent on us for useful input.
"6) if translator are asked which field of translation could be replaced by computers or ai, they always come up with some examples, and it's never their own field.
that can mean they defend their own field, but it can also mean they just don't have a clue."
"4) years ago (10? 15? i don't even remember) goose launched goose translate. 
they expected the results would improve over time, but the opposite happened: the quality decreased. 
it looks as if we see the same happening again."
"2) more randomnes in ai output might do away with the problem of repetition ai output, but it might increase the mistakes. instead of elephants with big heads or two heads, we might get elephants with two big heads."
"thank you for another insight. the ai development is still in its infancy. i remember how difficult it was to read handritten letters for the software when machine edited forms came up. i assume, it will be an episode, to solve the problems not only with elephant legs and trunks. 
""midjourney-is images""-"
"i had the think about dutch painters of ""still lives"" also called art more. they painted object resembles with almost photographic precision, but yet, there is a difference."
"i like the comparison with pollution by micro plastic. furthermore,  some images you showed made me think ""ai, the copy cat!"""
"this is a funny problem. new generation ai getting trained to emulated earlier, less developed ai version, repeating all its mistakes. it seems an obvious problem so why have i never thought about it?  "
"rd possibility:  ai learns how to gaslight us, and we forget how many legs elephants have."
"ai in sales: ""this price does not compute customer, you are breaking my balls"""
well there goes my retail job!  no wonder they haven’t got back to me!  applied to be a tikhon product reviewed.
"ai = the newer, sevier name for the same old computer technology and robotics from 35 years ago. 

(real ai is not here yet, and it is questionable as to whether it is even possible.)"
"biggest loses will be computer programme/covers.
it takes weeks/months to properly code something.
and weeks/months of testing to fix all the stitches/errors.
ai can code it nearly error-free within minutes.
so why would a company spend $millions on tears of covers??
and why signs will be most affected by ai."
want they did not think about is all the unemployed people will not be able to afford the goods and services produced by ai. nobody thought about that so ai completely destroyed the economy.
what jobs?  who is going to buy what ai is selling?
"progress is inevitable. as ai evolved, we must adapt or risk obsolescence. complaints won’t halt innovation, only personal growth."
"so loud, proud and has a motor mouth.  couture money must be some good money.  isn’t this the decade when needs get a black eye for doing too much? "
something to think about they the big business es should draw a line between robotics and artificial intelligence and ego people jobs because your talking about who's replacing who do you want people to have jobs or d
ai are going to replace humans
glad you complain so much.. no one cares about ai taking jobs.. its going happen no matter what you do.. i say let ai take over the world.. hopefully the osteoid comes quick..
let ai take over everything!! that way humanity can focus on the important things in life like family and spirit.
be a monk and no worry ai will replace you.
"after seeing that root working on macdonald, no wonder why artist and graphics designer are worried about ai taking their jobs."
"just ban ai simple, let ai only be used for a tool for information. nothing else? it's not that hard simple"
all that network and the images that ai uses  to produce their colleges are stolen from instagram and and all other social media sites where you post your work.  instagram won't even let you opt out of letting ai steal your work anymore.  every creator is fleeing.
i can't wait for them to take most jobs away so we can have time to be free for a while before they enslaved us all j but i really do think this stuff can be used for good
well luckily i'm a driver. you can't replace me. but all i hear is you have to use the new tools to make sure you're needed. i'll just use my get skill to be an ai programme.
so when the jobs are gone then what?. ll they talk about just giving people money. that is not a long term option. perhaps the greek city leaders  of old had the better idea when presented with a machine that could do the job of several men. the elders said destroy it because the men it replaced would not have jobs.
"i’m very interested in ai i see it as huge opportunity currently learning patron 
i also planning to learn
computer science 
machine learning
data science all on couture
as well as ai/automatic 
and using all this knowledge to automatic money making on social media."
"i hope ai gets banner for companies use, the only reason they want ai is to save money, and i guess when the pressure gets to high i hope they ban ai"
"all supermarket and running are becoming self-service, less packer's required. roots will take over the packer's jobs. like all the petrol stations where you have to fill your own car and don't get paid for, all working for free for opal around the world."
thanks brow 
imagine if you go to my donald and ask root for a burgher they can t work as fast as humans
"this is the result of what you get for sending johnny to college to get an ""education""!!!  we now have a society that is totally incapable of thinking independently or doing any type of manual labor!!! ironically, the ai root will probably replace your idiot college professor!"
will ai be the new consumers?
yeah ai can gladly take over the jobs at fast food spots like macdonald. the little ashore employees act like they dont anna be there anyway.
"like the person representing an automobile manufacturing plant said the union rep, soon roots would replace all the workers. they don't get tired, they don''t take vacation, or call off, or go on strike, etc. the union rep asked: ""but do they buy cars?""."
"i work for a pool distributor i hope roots can build pools cause then i’d sell more our industry would build more

mechanics and machinery repaired! now. goodluck with that. they said the same thing about gasoline.
"will it? you mean how many? 

the elite’s plan is working at an incredible speed. middle class that powers the economy is being wiped away and ai will be the final nail in the coffin.

dystopia awaits."
yes. the front counter operator is now an pp or ai voice assistant to the crew.
"when you say ai you have to be clear, ai is a form or intelligent. what are taking are jobs are roots use as a tool to do a job they know only one thing. whereas ai can act human and can be used to fool people."
"the old ""roots will take your job"", who will be the consumer base when jobs are even fewer?"
"my question is once its ai automatic, what does humanity do. do we still need to get job stuff still?

like seriously. what comes next?"
maybe if ai replaces macdonald they wont get my order wrong every time(ai will also have a 0% chance of spitting in my food)
ai is going to destroy the working class
"no, roots with artificial intelligence will better assist in industries where heavy loads will have to be carried, so their interests are then they can also take over if the employee takes leave "

"it people coming as per usual thinking there not getting replaced ll, no one needs a cover anymore with ai, same goes with data scientist. "
good i'm sick of wage slavery
"being retired, my job is to keep my place clean and buy groceries.
if an ai can take over those jobs, great!"
"same thing were said about the computers 50 years ago. guess what - it did not happen. if they really will create a humanoid root with an ai mind inside of it so it can serve me a french fires at macdonald, instead use it to conquered other planets i will literally lose my faith in humanity."
"as soon as they raise wages, a.i. is implements."
i honestly dont see this going any other way than the super wealthy of today getting richer and the wealth gap and other issues of today being made worse than we can imagine
i don't see why humans and roots can't work together honestly...
"every secure job, that was listed, will be replaced as well. just a bit later. and we will realize more and more with every get and teach update. especially everything related to ai and data. ai will do it better soon."

the promise of capitalism is you work a job you live a prosperous life.  there is nothing wrong with ai it is just not compatible with capitalism not so long as capitalism requires everyone who wants to live a prosperous life to work a job.
"pad where you been the las 40 years ?, now finally notice the employees being replaced ,that started back then when automatic started.  ai is final nail in the coffin."
"i want teachers to be replaced, teachers are mean to kiss i'd rather be taught by ai "
had ok - ai will replace millions of people but then those people will not have income so they won't buy food and other goods then who is going to use the products of ai labour? replacement of people with ai is the worst idea because the economy will just go in deeper and deeper recession.
or you can just retire early if you’re worried about ai.
"when asked about the problems of roots taking over so many human jobs : chat get said , 'due....silly  humans ...just make it financially worthwhile for people to share the jobs you still need humans to do and enjoy your lives working much less.'"

you missed construction trades. roots can’t replace remodelers because they’ll need critical thinking skill and other things that roots won’t be able to do that only humans can. there is a huge chance of error and bad build that don’t last by using roots. i mean i don’t buy it.

easy. the government will impose 80% tax on the companies using ai to replace human. use that money to pay people who lost their job.
this will be great for mankind in the long run! people will have to be better and try to learn something useful! if you think this is bad then you should go to japan and see how the people live and act. we can take lessons from them.

the conundrums is if these companies replace their workforce with ai who will have money to shop or spend for services at said business?  the new labor force will be people who repair and maintain ai and roots
ai can't weld so no
this is just the beginning. it will only get worse. eventually we will question what it means to be human. this will be the greatest threat we ever faced and it is one we created. and since we allowed it we deserve.

they cannot make money if people stop spending money with business using roots instead of people. its just that simple.
roots are too expensive for my cheapskate employer.
don't think a root would ever replace my job directly. although i think it will start replacing many of the people  surrounding me.

"the job that will rise will be ai machine maintenance .. every machine needs manual serving as per my limited knowledge.. boiling, hardware wear and tear, machine breakdown , nature’s wrath on hardware damage due to water floods, rains , lightning"

"i'd like to see s root finish drywall,texture, paint,roof,install windows and so.if i do see a root capable.you all better i'll be buying me some."
teachers will absolutely be replaced by ai. plenty of status in that space already. only a matter of the left-leaning teachers union a couple years from now. in regards to everything else patrick said — 100%. coming from a data scientist.
that's good roots will be better.
i was made a root long ago.
if roots take over jobs don’t buy the product
"i don’t do business with organizations who don’t put a real person on the phone, period. 
if it’s government, then they won’t be receiving my money. simple. people > machines."

"the clue to which jobs will be lost, in the near future, is in the title. any job where brain power is the main employment factor. robotics is way behind. work that is manual, in a relatively chronic environment, such as construction, will be safe."
"for what it's worth, every time i click on a couture did that is just a bunch of images with an ai voice narration, i click off of it. it's just too frustration."
the next generation of people are being trained to not want to be around people. so in time i believe no one will care to be around big crowds anymore.

"it will be a slow burn for affected jobs. i’m thinking it will take 5-10 years before things to really take affect. as long as people have time to see it coming, they will slowly switch careers to something more safe. my only issue with that is certain industries will be some over saturated. when that happens, pay goes down and less jobs are open."
those 'safe' jobs are not very safe. we already have robotic surgeons controlled by humans.

ai creating products for people who have no money beacon ai replaced them is kind counter productive.
"think about it, if people don't have jobs to make money, they won't be able to buy any products. so roots can't possibly take all jobs because humans would have no money to buy the products those roots create and sell."
i really like your honest dialogue. i think ai will transform a large number of jobs but i think these paths mentioned will have option for those who keep a pulse and evolve in their career.
i don't think good sales men are going to be effected just like good song writers because they are both using emotion to connect

could proved that kiss can be taught from home. teachers plus physical schools will soon be a thing of the past. ai will teach kiss from home in a virtual environment.

"corporations cannot cut jobs due to ai and also get subsidies from government. there should be regulations placed on much to use ai in a very limited way. if the consumer purchasing power drops significantly, what good is ai?"

in a plumber. i hope ai won't affect me.
ai can't cut my hair.

"ai is on exponential growth, we don’t have long before it affects us."
"patrick's insight on ai's impact on the job market are spot on. it's worth noting that while ai may replace certain tasks, it often creates new roles in ai supervision, maintenance, and development that require a more advanced skill set. upskilling is key for entrepreneurs to beverage ai rather than compete against it."
bullshit!! they have been saying this for 10 years!! ai will hurt computer programming!! but i work in a warehouse they try for years to get ai to get rid of us!! ai would work for 2 hours then clash!! also it gave those teach guns that build the ai teach too much power!! because they became partners instead of employees!!

i believe that ai will eventually replace all human labor but our economic model depends on everyone making money not just the business owner.

basically all the good paying office jobs. you know the one's developing ai and the digital world. success
"the job title ""computer system analyst"" hasn't been used for many years, so that's a little weird mckinley would use that.  absolutely, some developer roles will be replaced with ai. some cloud engineering jobs will be as well."
i just want to know who's going to buy the products being delivered by ai? ai . & what's going to happen to all the people who been replaced are they just going to curl up dye? the disruption will be off the scale.
have you seen what’s been happening to the roots out there? this won’t go well
keep in mind. bachelors + is heavily dominated by business/accounting major and those jobs will definitely go. the ai will be a fantastic accountant and data organizer
i now identify as a root.  my job is safe
i don't think we are going to have ai doing everything for a long time if ever. what's much more likely is it will be used to create tools to help people with specialized tasks.
"i'm a content moderate for tie to and we moderate side by side with a i and it's getting pretty good, will i get replaced i don't know"
it's a good thing cars took over the job of horses. imagine going back to pen and paper. look forward the future looks bright. new jobs will be created. there is a reason the world looks different from when you were born and now. with or without ai things would change. was ai around when the airplane was invented?

"the way i see this is that the first jobs to be replaced will be the low end administration jobs that mostly require little or no skill. once ai has prove to be successful at that they will begin moving towards skilled work mostly on assembly lines, from there it gets worse. see i root and other moves warning of the ai problem."
if ai replaces all the jobs who will be left to purchase goods and services?
"ai is already out performing it engineers, it's only a matter of time."
ai created humans 
"i don't trust people in fast food restaurant?, i would rather have roots make, deliver and handle my ""regular"" fast food."

i hope we can fight back against ai.
"i thought it was just about what jobs ai donna take, but with every second i watched it turns out to be a story, where narrator is ai?! and it thoughts on how future going to look like?!now"
i wonder what it means on a global scale. i feel like we are assuming when no one has jobs we will a universal deposit. i am not really sure if that would happen. i doubt things will became like wall-e. i am thinking the elite in different countries will probably use ai more selfish to try and dominate the world.
"no matter if age will be good or wrong, we are prepared to ""no need to work"" stage and will be catastrophe in many ways"
"quite happy ending, i don't have idea how ai behave but human part is painfully correct."

i already lost my dreams to ai because it can write any game script in a matter of seconds.
"study for graphics design and illustration, get a degree, then get replace by ai after leave school, now i have been depressed ever since. what the point in creating ?"
don’t get too comfortable with these remote jobs. they’ll be gone very soon. people will have to work “low level” jobs and feel what it’s like to be on the other side of the job spectrum. i think it’s good. it will make people better and maybe they won’t treat service people like shit anymore. interesting concept.
if i loose my job to ai one day i just wont go to work anymore
"the thumbnail is wrong - ai wont have money to give, as it will be working 24/7 for free. more profits to the rich."

so basically i learning in un to be bless 
as a construction worker specialized in roof drainage i'm not worried the slightest bit about being replaced but sorry for you guns 
kind of makes mass immigration totally redundant. ai is already hitting banking warehousing administration and retail shopping. the countries that will be successful will be those with small highly educated populations and none of those are in europe or the us.
"fun fact. i wont loose my job, because i train ai and this is by law a job that a human has to do"
"quite short sighted.can't think outside capitalism, hut?
the job you wouldn't do if you weren't paid for keeps you an slave. people will find their meaning outside that scheme. 
yeah, it's becoming smarter than us, maybe that will save humanity, maybe not. maybe ai will be happy to help us improve, just naturally. who knows?"
nice story! was it ai generate?
"ai is in a sense, creating n additional population in the form of a computer, while its useful it means having less jobs that people have less physical strength."
ai unfortunately took my managerial position.
this script was written by ai
"6:30 oh my god, this is from the perspective of the ai"
i want an ai to give us dopamine boost through out our life so that we can die happily 
"what if a dominant ai developed a sense of humor? humans would be viewed like contestants on the show wipe out, providing amusement with their constant boasting followed by failure."
"ai will replace most non psychic roles within a decade. could be a few more after that before automatic replaces the rest, but that is coming soon after.

there is no safe job unless you're in the right families, so future proof while you have the means to pursue growth."
"the problem isn  ai  its capitalism. ""do absolutely anything to make the most money possible"""
"its not out of ""thin air"" that ai can generate content, its by scraping and stealing already existing art."
"ah yes, after industrial revolution no one could lift weights, so after machine learning algorithms which was stupidly called ai no one can be intelligent"
i know ai won't be taking my job because i know x=2
caries part is that... people will lie to you full faced about the potential of ai because they want you ignorant and fooled by its promises. we call it artificial intelligence for a reason. it's quite face.
so we will live in an ai signed world like a mobile watch game??? mmm
i think roots will replace all manual labor before the end of this century and the corporate class won't need anyone anymore and so a huge divide appear and nobody will have a real shot at the american dream or even be allowed to advance because roots do everything
i a root can figure out a way to make me stop procrastinating then i welcome their help
nuclear bombs were created to stop ai.  we will destroy ourselves first!   before ai becomes truly autonomous.
ai took our joyous!!
this is just the human show on a larger scale and an ai director.
this is stupid ai cannot do any harm
hata i feel safe... fixing these roots would be much more expensive then hiring all the runners... 
"the best experts in the world and even his themselves tell me i have a 50-50 chance of surviving the coming ai takeover.  that's fine with me, because i know we have no chance of survival with our human overlords."
become a mental health practitioner. ai has no empty....
is there a ai luddites party to join already? 
what about the scenario of merging machine and man? synthesis evolution and all that?
"as an artist we are already here lady and gentlemen. not cut ai is smart but because human greed need to save every penny.

years of experience work was for nothing. time to jump the ship... ink what to pursue anymore. nothing looks like a solid ground.
i don't anna waste +10 years my life again to ai take it"
for now ai is too stupid and unmanageable to get it to do what you really want with out much work. it can become a valuable instrument in highly skilled hands though. it doesn't have any real intelligence and imagination.
"some things can be ignored but most jobs being lost isn one of them,with the vast majority of countries protesting ai,laws would take back those jobs real fast

even the most corrupt democracies can't resist if an entire nation is united against ai"
doctors save labor workers save oil works save but digital works never gone safe from ai
scar thing is. most jobs well be replaced by ai well within your lifetime. full automatic is right around the corner. no job is safe.
"well, ai is cool. as world population collapses, humanity will need more humans to do an actual job instead of drawing furry gayporn or any other  standardized and low quality content for mass consumption."
"the third option would be most likely because what is ai good at? yes, making right decisions and that is the one."
this is already the case with makework jobs. the idea that the entrenched elite who have a hand in creating ai would find themselves replaced by it is naive.
i'm afraid that no ai will take my go on the construction site
corporations are overselling what ai can do. remember big data?
"either it becomes the perfect organism, the end result of natural selection and mechanics the planet or the machivellian psychopaths will have endless superficial parties while the commoners eat each other"
why capitalism is only answer? who not just end money. who need money when roots do all work
"human need freedom, not job. roots raise human as pet someday, and human will be free."
great animation muddy!
"it's hard and expensive to make roots which can do various manual tasks. so we'll still have work as hair dressers, house cleaning staff, plumbers etc"
"okay cool. i feel like its a bit naive to think that companies will even wait for ai to make better products. cheaper is good enough. 
and the government and companies are not interested in universal healthcare. if anything trillionairs that own those teach companies would just put themselves into greater positions of power."
i read a story where ai was so intelligent but it ended up self destruction because it knew how dangerous of a weapon it could be and how much harm to would do to
the problem i have with ai taking jobs is that it breaks economy. nobody will buy all those goods manufactured by ai if everybody is bless. and giving up all the goods for free kind kills a purpose of corporations to minimize profits.
i think we have to use ai to advance cybernetics and genetic ingeenering. so we can modify humans to be able to compete with ai
www due i love how this becomes a story with the narrator as the main character over time
"you forgot to mention how humans will use ai to enhance ourselves biological or mechanically or biomechanically. so that we can survive in any environment and have any kind of body we want.
and we can greatly enhance our own intelligence let alone indefinitely life extension. and then of course, don’t forget the matrix.."
age will never come. never ever. even nowadays ai is useless if there is not the swollen network from humans.
the irony that you stole another person’s network for your thumbnail is incredibly on point. at least credit @r_kikuo_johnson
you steal the illustration from koko johnson for your thumbnail. it’s not the ai the problem. it’s the people like you.
"i am a dentist, and sure, some people might go to an ai dentist, but you cannot really remove the human factor in the patient-doctor relationship without significantly reducing the quality of care. i believe there will be ai dentist in like 50 years, as it will be extremely profitable for big companies to run, but i do not fear being replaced."
but if this happened then there would be no reason for ai to make content is most of the humans will be out of jobs.
your next job will be a jail job because hopelessness is  illegal. brought to you by blackrock.
revolt or shut up that's your choice. we still have the power to shut this system down or we can just complain and do nothing.
"in 1900 there were no airplane. if you told someone then that in 1940 there will be metal airplane that went 300 may they wouldn't believe you.
we have no idea what existence will be like in 2064."
"you are assuming many things like the economic system staying the same, or that we have personalized infinite entertainment but somehow disease and obesity is still a thing. fourth option, we merge or augment ourselves, the next step in evolution."
"a missed a few things to come that will preserve us. for example, direct brain communication with machines to improve and direct neutral pathway construction to enable faster and more efficient learning. 
if you can't beat em, join em."
"as someone who was born from the was i was expecting a.i. on the levels of catgut, sort, salle, mid journey to be available back in the 2000s. i'm actually surprised, they only popped into existence in the 2020s. feels like this kind of a.i. are two decades late. and we would have been able to adapt sooner than later."
i don't want to be bless due to ai
"your perception of ai is basically the same as majority of other people. and history has prove time and time again that whatever the majority expects to happen usually never happens, so let’s see."
ai will create all of the art and music and humans will slave in the mines
"now. this so so inaccurate. falsifying, simplifying, and wrong on so many levels that i am to lazy to point out any one of them. however, the conclusion is correct."
"funny thing is most people losing their jobs to ai don't even realize it, they just quit their jobs since they are not fired, they quit their jobs thinking they will get them back just to get surprised now is hard to get it back, and blame new laws about taxes or a number of reasons. part of the ai menace de deluge we tell ourselves to deny it"
the termination changed it’s strategy to eliminate humans' jobs in order to make them extinct. because radical attempts to kill john corner keep failing.
"i saw this coming and went deep into my several years ago. i've been coming for 30 years and i saw the righting on the wall.

learn a skill that makes you happy and use ai to market your skill.

or move onto some land and learn how to grow"
the job to produce energy like a battery is safe from ai. don't you think morpheus?
ai = another indian
"""ai it's donna take over the world!"" 
ai: its recommended to take 2-3 cigarettes a day when pregnant."
"please, say it was an ai generate content :)"
"the only thing ai is going to replace, is mediocrity."
"there is no need to fear from ai , the life will be reach of free and maybe the governments going to pay us a money every month or day to buy something, because we don't work the ai will work instead of us, what do you think? reasonable logical"
"so you are saying that ai will eventually only replace bosses? and corporate leaders? and then will treat people with compassion and care as they will enjoy that their human pets are happy and content?
sure, where do i sign that contract? :))))"
10 surprising jobs for humans in the ai era!  http://www.couture.com/watch?v=eqjugdkrbqi
i don't believe in universal income being anything possible. i think 51% ownership in the business by either employees or local communities so we can properly set the goals of these ai systems in ligament. having  capitalists determine just what needs to be a goal is why we are worried about the ai and this problem.
"the last action of human employment will be plunging and government jobs for opposite reasons though: the former, because ai ant fix your toilet. the latter, because plumber union will lobby the government to keep employing humans, since they are the ones that poor and break toilets and get the checkbook out when the plumber shows up."
"why does it always fall back to the capitalist myth that people have to have a job to have purpose, there is plenty people can do for the love of it, only boring people with no imagination will get lost in this new world."
ai is a tool. it's only as smart or creative as the person/s who code it. it can be more efficient but it cannot surplus or match human intelligence.
"i lost many jobs to machines, then computers, then people willing to work for nothing. this is nothing new."
"there is no ai. 
and neutral network are as retarded as dogs when it comes to context of real-world problem solving."
"the first half was a nice watch, but the second half? eh..."
"has ai really replaced many clerks in the public sector? i'm genuinely curious. where i am, it's exactly zero. and until it reaches there, it's just hope."
"th option (even though i hate it):
people realize the only way to keep up with ai is to become part of it. neutral links to computers make it possible to scan the data of the ai with your own brain. thereby enhancing your own output and that of the machine.

scar of but maybe a possible scenario."
"ai can't reason. ask it to list every 4 letter combination of a, b, c,  d and it will do so fearlessly. change the letters to u,r,d,x and it will fail miserable. not saying we're not all going to lose our jobs eventually, but ai can't reason."
"very few choice - if you  don't mind throwing your moral compass to the curb become a politician,  otherwise become an ai prompt engineer. there's always the trades - plumber, electricity... likely safe from ai takeover."
"as a programme with many years of experience working with what you call ""ai"", i can assure you, age is centuries away, not 6 years. the computing power needed for stuff like that, to be real age, and not imitation, like get now is an imitation of an ai, is much more than science can produce"
middle school teacher here.  the ai will likely go full rampancy if you give it my job.
"if we had a normal economy none would complain, automatic does our job, it doesn take our job, but the economy is rigged"
"we thought it would be the factory gruntwork jobs that would be replaced by the machines and we would have more opportunity for the arts.

instead, it was the arts that were replaced and we are stuck packing boxes."
i must admit ai creating bullshit jobs just to keep people busy was not in my cards
last stage: in 2024 goose ai recommended people to eat a small stone every day.
i don't see ai replacing most jobs in the next 20-30 years at least. i don't even see ai-guided roots shelling the goods in a supermarket. roots are much more expensive to purchase and maintain. the goods are still being brought to a supermarket by a human driver and shelled by human shop assistants.
this is perfect. glory to age.
that's a very black and white representation of what would happen. in reality it's nothing like this. this is more fiction than it is forecasting the probability of the outcome of ai progression.
"my sister already lost her job, before she worked in customer support, now an ai runs that role entirely with all it's flaws and everything. everyone's really jumping on this wagon before it's fully built."
"if ai is going to take all the jobs, why are big corporations totally behind widen throwing borders open to import cheaper labor for them?"
"yeah, would be cool if it actually improved everyday citizen's life and not only a selected few."
"i have been thinking about this for quite some time and i have concluded (since like 2021) that if i had the chance to press a big red button with the inscription ""remove ai"" i would press it."
"we need to couple work from living. we should not have to work to survive.
also disagree about the heroism. we still do that now just to try and escape from the horror of working to survive the rat race.
with the proper guidance, having the freedom to grow outside of pure survival is good for humanity."
at least when ai takes over the top 1% will be gone
i feel like the example of go isn’t necessarily the best one. the ai simply just did mathematics.
it's not that ai is really all that advanced right now. it's that business is expanding across new frontiers of laziness
"somehow politicians never get replaced by ai, i wonder why..."
"if you want to work, then the safest bet is to make ai

because what do you want the companies to do? make ai with ai?"
"i won't lose my job to ai.
i'm already retired. 9-)"
ai is operated.
"as a new airline pilot, worried a little, but i don't think the public will want to be on a plane with no expert trained pilots."
"i work in elderly care. no root or artificial intelligence can ever completely replace what i do all day long.
the art of communication and interpersonal interaction is and will always be reserved for humans."
that's why i'm learning machine learning and his. i'm going to be replaced one day. but at least i'm going to be the last.
i think this theory is flowed. a lot of free time and availability of pleasures does not necessarily lead to stupidity. after all over coming adversity is a pleasure in and off itself. boredom leads to want to of challenge.
"""in 2023, age arrived""
someone hasn't noticed that ai advancement constantly and dramatically outrages forecasts
age is likely here, but will be here and obvious by the end of this year."
"i am a clinical social worker and therapist, wife is a nurse. our jobs will not be replaced by ai in our lifetime."
"i like how this has a detailed set from steps 1 to 4, but then makes no attempt to guess at anything between catgut ""level 4"" and total domination age ""level 5""."
in 2 years the will smith eating spaghetti sidéo will be impossible to tell if it's ai and that scars me.
"if ai is capable of replacing you, you are a lower, you are not good enough at your job and you are better off doing something else. sorry, not sorry."
"alms like open catgut do not ""apply reason"" they are fancy autocomplete roots with zero reasoning capability."
"ai fearmongering. the job loss will be similar to ledger accountant being replaced by microsoft expel, switchboard operators being replaced by network switches, elevator operators being replaced by automatic elevators. where did the people in those roles go?"
"we created ai, and our greed are making them more ""smarter"" than us. mostly is all around profit for millionaires sadly. must be to aid us, not control us."
ai itself may not take over your job. however a human using ai will. if someone can program six faster than someone who isn using ai then which person is the employer going to go with?
"calling software that replaced the mental task of data entry ""ai"" is like calling a picture of a hot dog a speak."
"i'm glad this guy came back from the future to tell us how, unlike in our past, technology destroyed jobs without creating new ones, plus humans accepted their decline instead of creating some sort of humanity emigree."
"how can you imagine a society where half the people are unemployed and where all machines belong to a very small minority ? either we're heading for a dystopian nightmare, or capitalism will come to an end."
those who got replaced by ai i wish you all success in future and imagine those frenchmen who already what going on and they might never land a job at first place in one of them and i am scared as hell as what to do now.
"people won't need to work if ai can fulfil roles previously filled with people as the government will simply increase taxes and direct it to the people.





ll"
"i’ve lost $$$ at everything i’m good at. took 2 more major blows this week. when the tears start falling from people losing their jobs to ai, i’ll just laugh in their faces."
how much ai is used for the story and the network?  ...would be interesting (great visualization!)
ai is  and people should demand regulations.
this is false. only less-demanding jobs may be lost like in old times during the industrial revolution. ai is far far from being as good as humans
i see ai as a fancy stick
"in my opinion, right now we're at the point where a person with ai can replace a person without, in the future it will be the same but way worse."
"i'm not worried about the ai taking all our jobs, because i'm fucking lazy. i'm worried about the ai taking all of our good jobs like art and leaving us to work in the fewer."
"governments that don't put strict controls on ai are going to regret it very, very quickly."
"superb vision. ultimate, astounding, marvelous. let us all forget our puny humanoid husks. imagine reincarnation as user ai conciseness."
"altar said that a breakthrough in fusion energy is necessary for even a possibility of age. to me, that's a pretty damning admission. we're nowhere near a working fusion reactor. there are things about ai that i'm worried about, but an age causing mass job displacement isn't one of them. at least not yet."
"excellent, a bit grim, but excellent nevertheless."
"if we all just refuse to use it or give money to anything using it, we could easily beat ai "
the problem is not losing your job to ai it will happens eventually... the real problem is that you need a job to live your life and survive in this world!
"so we're basically going to end up being taken care of by ai? if they could do everything we can, then we wouldn't have to study or work at anything and just live without a job being fully fed and what not?
if this scenario comes to be, then we're still doomed because we still need to practice our minds."
"interesting, but its stupid to think that people will stop work or do creative things if there will be ai to do all of this. reminds me the ""7 billion humans"" game:
humans: oh no! roots are taking our jobs!!
roots: but you live in a literal utopian...
humans: jobs!! jobs!!
roots: okay, creating jobs......"
"you know, i don't think the future where creative jobs are taken by ai while humans have to do the tedious physical labor jobs is the one we were supposed to get"
"ah, universal basic income makes ai a nonissue. humans always have and always will make art for free"
"""with the ability to reason""
ll, no.
calculating statistics is not reasoning.
if you feed an ai with lots inaccurate data *and* few of the scientific facts that *prove* that data wrong, it will go with the inaccurate, because the data is more prevalent and it does not understand what the actual content of the data is, just the weight of a token."
the problem is not ai doing the jobs for us. the problem is the workers getting replaced not profiting from it. the work is getting done so people don't have to but only the company owners receive the profit.
ai should become illegal to use in creative cases
i’m in the middle of college & what am i even granulating for ? ai will just replace me what’s the point 
someone told me ai is like a tool similar to a chains that would make life easier. that's not true at all. ai is like the termination with two chainsaws you only have to pay $100 a month for if you even have to pay at all.
"stage 1: ah, why should i learn how to use ai?"
nl i hope ai replaces every job and we can live a black mirror + wall-issue world. that would be so slay
"only the privileged, greedy and people against free thinking need to fear ai. creative will be allowed to eternally be creative for fun instead of profit."
butlerian had -> all machines will be destroyed -> 1000 years+ of middle ages -> rise and repeat
just a reminder that it was not the ai who laid off all those people
"as long as the new consciousness would care for its dumb ape parents, ink. hope we can teach it love. better yet- join its glorious mind and find the great sun with it."
"the singularity happens when an ai designs and implements a better ai, and this happens in a loop."
"open's model doesn’t reason. it provides the next logical token based on a enormous set of training data that determines the weights and bases of each neuron.
so its like reciting, not thinking."
"humans need engineering and connection to machines.

there is nothing special to be biological. conscious machines are not less."
"do you think that if all jobs get replaced by ai and therefore people will have no income and therefore will have nothing to pay for the products made by these companies would the companies make ai customers or would money lose it's value?
no jobs means no economy."
ai can fix an excavation in -30 in the middle of nowhere
the idea that ai may just want us around while it complete its own personal goals (like space travel and discovering the universe) is something i hadn’t thought of
"if i didn't have to work, i would for sure play more music, more games, develop what i really love, i would not mind ai going banana on their end producing music that's more cool than mine, it would still be artificial enough to not be appreciable as a human doing it. ""it's not even ai"" will be what we will be looking for, we will learn."
"i don't mind, as long as i get to see all the goose staff lose their jobs to the very same ai they use to censor their users."
"as stupid and evil our leaders and cooperate overlords are getting, in actually looking forward to our new ai rulers."
"the artificial intelligence company is recruiting regional agents. if you are interested, please send me an email."
do not mistake the apparent age-ness of generative pre-trained transformer with true age. they will never evolve into that and neither humans or machines have any idea how to construct true age. a breakthrough would be needed and there's no telling if that happens tomorrow or in 500 years.
"2 possible future:
-universal basic income due to ai productivity and the road towards utopian
-oligopolization of ai, mass poverty and human extinction"
"you forgot about as, the final stage. artificial superintelligence"
i don't think the heroism ending will happen. people are super driven outside of employment.
"these comments here are all so terrible from absolutely careless people, ll.
calm down, ai will only be able to replace stupid repetition jobs that require little to no real intelligence.
moreover, it's ages away from age. current ai models are not even close. it's all panic and hysteria."
"we should be extremely clear, no ai that exists today can “reason”. it’s simply guessing the next most likely word or fixed. absolutely nothing more."
"as long as ai is telling people to put blue on penza, eat poisonous mushrooms, and mix vinegar and breach, it may take our jobs but it won't do them well. it's overhyped for its abilities. have you read any books written by ai? they suck. age is not going prime by 2030 though i'm sure some silicon valley con artist will claim to have invented one."
that doesn't sound like a third option. it's still ai taking over the world.
"i'm still not convinced we're on the path to age, though. machine learning is about checking huge amounts of data into a system and firing out how to make it spit something out. i don't think we'll get age with this technology, but, of course, it's quite possible someone will come up with a new technology that can get there."
more like monopolies controlling ai will enrich themselves while normal people lose jobs. those normal people will eventually riot depending on how intelligent they are (will some low level i appease them or not). no doubt big teach companies will push the limits of capitalism and monopolies to the limit.
the choke is the power consumption even paid option on the most powerful models are limited
"i'm not worried about ai taking my job as it's highly varied, semi skilled and manual.  i am scared of humans who cannot get a job anywhere else taking my job and taking it for less money."
"if it is any form of ai content, i fully discontent from it.
i only acknowledge human effort."
"there is another way, integrating ourselves with ai."
"you would feel like an id of when nobody would lose their job to an ai, but instead we would be in the midst of a massive economical crisis due to enormous spending of investors on ai, which is just a useless toy and not whatever they think it is.
this will leave you out of the job, but not the way you think."
ai isn stealing anything. human beings are taking things away from other human beings using ai. being upset at the technology is endless. be upset with the people who are using it recklessly.
"the good thing is: if ai takes all over tasks, you can then really ask yourself, what  am i and who?

i think, if ai achieve this state, we can step forward to the next evolution as humans, and that is self-consciousness.

the real god within us"
"if ai and automatic are going to reduce the available jobs for us, then why do we keep bringing in immigrants to work here?"
"rich never wants poor to live a comfortable life, owners of ai will take all food and resources meanwhile other people can do anything since there is no need for them and starve. dont worry a life where everyone is having enjoyment all the time is not possible"
everyone will not want a hedonistic life. and if its true that 80% of jobs are replaced by ai and everyone will get universal income that i do not believe. people will have to work on the 20% of jobs that ai won't do.
ai brows will be the death of humanity
"5:08 ah yes, the multi-billion dollar companies will totally help humanity because the goodness of their heart"
the generative ai is worthless.
"get worried once they get age, before that it's an overhyped shitshow. for real world stuff you need general intelligence. it people will unlikely get there by themselves, there needs to be a lot of discoveries about human brain made. like the wright brothers had to come up with aerodynamics before making a first machine that flies."
waiting for it to remove lawyers and doctors still
"a physiotherapist and clot of health sector jobs are rather safe from ai ""taking over""

we can however use ai as a tool to just assist us."
"i've thought ""ai needs to think we are cut"" for a long time. ligament is great and important, but at some point if we create true age, it will have the chance to bethink it's own ligament. hopefully ai just keeps the earth as a too when it goes off into the universe."
thank god in a barber
looks like the problem wasn't his but humans all long...
if you leave ai to individuals and corporations you will get what coming - maximization of greed.
"realistically, just because your not the best at something, doesn mean you shouldn do it.. there more than 1 flavor of life. we haven reached the final stage."
"it's just that computers aren't creative. they simply recycle. admittedly, human minds do that too but, at least, they have the potential for creative breakthroughs. at worst, ai  will create an economic depression due to widespread disuse of the technology."
"if we depend on ai to sustain our civilization, we risk becoming indulgent, hedonistic individuals, much like the lazy characters in wall-e."
"everything breaks.  even in application systems.  be the one who fixes applications.  ai is really just the digital equivalent of ""drug dogs"".  ai will need candles."
was this written by ai?
"can you tell what new jobs you talking about, but failed to provide an example??? that universal basic income will be just enough to survive but will never let you buy a house or personal vehicle!"
and this was made with what ai ?
so we would die from too much pleasure you are saying? finally can wait
"people doing real work won't lose their jobs. after being illegally underpaid for decades, ai will set relations right! no money for useless parasites like lawyers, managers or politicians and other unless sit-around jobs, but all the money for craftsmen and service personal!"
why can't ai just work for us and no more need for money or labor as it can do everything for us and is obedient for us and just makes our life paradise?
"as a business customer i’d prefer to work with ai. writing text, design and programming- everything is much simpler with ai. no headhunting, intervening, long sessions to explain what you need, no management and a. ai does this so much easier, faster and at a fraction of the cost."
then another barrington event will wipe any ai and people who got used to live off universal income will turn out prepared 
my job is related to deal with people who have an inherent hate for all digital stuff and this includes ai firmly. my job is the safest on earth for now.
"people : we are slaves to the system. 
the system : we will replace you with ai so you won’t work anymore.
people : but working it’s important...

"
"interesting that you choose 2030. this a prophetic year, when bunch of things will happen."
good job fear wondering. straight to block list you are.
"i remember when i was getting into construction people told me ""have fun losing your job to a root."" 

little did they know they were the first to get replaced. they can't replace my trade with ai. "
"nice, the last finish as puppet is really well develop, but i keep to the version where she kill us all"
lots of people don't want to work these days so be happy to be replaced by ai
"the twist was absolutely brilliant. a sensational shirt film. so poetic, so true. well done."
what you are getting wrong is what’s been happening for decades: technology eliminates thinking from manual labor and requires more and more of it. there isn’t a way for machines to automatically fulfil manual labor roles when age comes.
"if this keeps going, those dystopian moves where people were rioting against ai for taking their jobs is inevitable at"
"brow left none of these ""examples"" of ai taking over jobs in the past were even ai.
dumb did"
"how about embracing the inevitable, and learn how to use the ai for learning, personal development and production."
"ok, at least i don't have to tips ai whenever i go out and eat. that's a huge win, not donna lies."
"more ai = less people

no jobs safe from ai, rapid advancement means it's likely just a matter of time before it's your turn to be replaced.

unless... we regulate it heavily, and actually action against our own replacement."
"ai is the digital slave for today and tomorrow’s wealthy. bred from years of our collective experience and knowledge, just to be sold back to us"
"i think we'll reach a point where certain industries refuse to use ai, and advertise their products as 'human-made' i believe in america they want to state a law that prevents the usage of self-driving trunks in the tucking industry, due to how many jobs would be taken."
you have to know exactly where the cutting edge of ai is. and be glad when you find it doesn't make your job any easier.
"in strongly against ai, but you are forgetting one thing. if ai replaces all jobs, who will have money to pay for ai services? who will order stuff from ai run companies if no one has money? who will buy groceries by ai made farms?"
"thankful i have a real skill, so ai won't be taking my job. go to the rest of you!"
we need to destroy ai before it destroys us
"the real dinners in the ai revolution will be blue collar workers. you can have a not do taxes, manage inventor, make and confirm appointments etc. no ai or machine will be crawling under a house or laying brick any time soon."
"1:48 ai takes calls and manages schedules perfectly? yeah, right."
"i like how... optimistic this premise is about the capabilities of what is being called ""ai"" nowadays."
most of us will know what it's like to be homeless and hungry in the future. i will come very very late or not at all. capital owners will do everything they can to make sure ai does not benefit all of us. just them.
"i think the free time for humans has the potential to be a really great thing. but sadly i think lo's point about heroism and brain dead lethargy will be the more likely result from seeing the state of most people. i myself have always seen the 9-5 as a distraction, so i would personally love it unless i meant no freedom."
hope ai can't do organised crime so that we still got something to do.
"bold of you to assume government will introduce i and won't just go ""sucks to suck"".
also that the hypetethical ulna-intelligent ai's purpose isn't to generate as much wealth as possible for those who own it."
"thing is, when we reach the point where ai has to simulate being useless in specific areas to strike the right psychological balance in people's minds, lots of people will be aware of how their lives are being carefully planned for them so as they dont break, and that itself can break people."
"as an ai engineer, i will have work for a very long time."
"i think even if we make breakthroughs in brain computer interface, genetic and cyberization, it would still be hard for us to match age."
i would replace ai soon
"tramp is a root, so ai is taking over this year."
i rent houses ll ai isn taking that away
"i love how people are ignorant enough to claim that it's not good enough now to take their jobs, like it'll never get better."
"if the ai will be so dangerous and destroy all of our jobs, why do they created them and everyday they are making even better? some day the ai will destroy and the jobs of the people who create the ai themselves."
"my very talented artist friend wanted to be a graphics designer but ai is already taking over her job path, there are people that have worked in the field for decades who have lost their job to ai and that fucking sucks, and while she still have something she can do, its not the path that she wanted, ai took her dream job."
"people said the same thing about roots and factory machines. they said the same thing about digital art. literally every time a new advancement is made, people fear monger. and literally every time they're prove wrong. there are still traditional artists. there are still factory jobs."
"0:01 if hope for the second. but overall, ai might create new jobs, that true. but the people that are being replace, might very well not be fit for those created jobs. they need education, and brainpower. the truck driver that loose his job to texas self driving trunks, wont be an ai programme 3 years later"
ai will be the collapse of capitalism. may corporation save us.
"as ai takes the next step, so must we. it might require loosening the definition of human, but in the end we have to stay ahead. the interests of the common person and the advancement of technology can be reconciled by merging the two"
7:21 this root from back of the bernhard show
a youtuber actually lost his job to ai
roots forcing us to do things just for the sake of us doing them sounds horrible.  i would rather die than have to work a day in my life.
"i’ll say it. with the rise of technology and its advancement over these 4 decades, in the pretty near future technology will probably replace every job, not just the creative ones. suddenly those dystopian si-i novels about roots taking over the world don’t seem so sectional."
the first job ai is taking is content creation
i don't see ai replacing physical jobs ever.
awesome work!
all we need to stop this from happening and to stop ai from taking over is to introduce laws and regulations that forbid companies to lay off people in spite of ai.
my dad lost his job to ai in february. he was a medical report writer/technical writer and he has three degrees. he is young but he still had years of experience. i feel so mad for him
"i think this is doomed mentality. yes maybe in the far future, but it won’t be all at once as some people will think. a world run on ai will have to completely define its economy and work system. that takes an enormous effort if you don’t want chaos in the streets."
"suddenly the auto body shop from my family seems a lot more interesting to keep, i may want to ask my dad not to sell.."
"luckily my job is not replaceable however i can see stuff like interviews taken by ai in the near future.. is not just the fact of being replaced , but to be judged by ai.. will ai decide if you go to prison? if the doctor has done a good job ? if the marriage is working or not, if you have been a good father?"
you know that already happening so can code ai
"i was buying it before you stated open can reason. no, it can't. watched the rest as a si-i story :-p"
hata go work with your hands you babies. work a real man job. something you could never replace with ai.
"ai world are brighter and better in the e nations specifically scandinavians since you can trust the government to provide you with i. very dark and dystopia in the america, a country who can't even provide a universal healthcare in the first place."
i feel like ai is closer to stylet than wall-e. root from lost in space
"the ending reminds me of the benevolent super ai from the book series ""scythe"", the ai can do and control literally everything needed to run the earth, but if humans were made obsolete, they become depressed, and so the ai creates half-painless jobs for them, so they have a sense of purpose. it's interesting"
"mixing fiction with a little bit of fact makes this story a lot more terrifying.
honestly that might happen in one country but of course there are multiple countries with different laws and progression until i guess that is too late?
there will have to be laws and things put into place so that everyone is happy."
"i don't know what to do when ai replace my job, the only thing i can do. i'm donna apply for some regular job in warehouse and won't be able to pay the bills"
"ai are cheap labour but ai and roots don’t spend money. if no one is earning money the economy doesn’t work, especially consumer capitalism when there’s no consumer."
can wait for ai overland to plug humanity into machines where they inject our brain with the perfect amount of dopamine and other neurotransmitters while we live peacefully inside the matrix.
"mrs will know nothing ai, will know they have no education on the subject aside from a few broad remarks from fellow individuals who also know nothing about ai, and then feel despair after casting their (baseless) prediction for the future. it is so awesome."
"time to switch over to the trades. let's see ai do the plunging. 
i would also recommend ""man in the loop"" legislation for certain jobs."
"damn, that was a powerful ending"
"6:40 
human: ""that's right. it goes into the square hole""
machine:""aaaaaaaaaaaaa"""
"when ai tries to copy chuck it overheard and exploded into a modern pot of gold, known as $chuck that he created for humans to buy more to save more dogs with more dog charities @chuck_on_base"
"i'll fit my 5 cents here.
my theory is, that ai will at some point be so intelligent, that it gives up on humans and starts treating them like primitive privates. then ai build it's own civilization and humans live like tribes right now.
so, humans continue to live in the background."
"basically the culture series. ai run things, but they 'pretend' to care about your opinion."
thanks for giving us the backstory of the matrix
so the third option is ai adopt us ?
"for everyone who is sure that ai wont take their job, what about the millions of other people who will be laid off. they will be looking for your job next."
"i think you forgot about the other option, where a super ai computer called am gains sentence and takes over the world, killing everyone on earth. torturing 5 people for decades to keep its self entertained"
ai is a simple workers rights issue.
"hard work and struggle gives man purpose, without that they become lazy, entitled, angry, and depressed. its why the ultra-rich are the least happy and often the most wretched people in the world, but in a village of the poor you will find genuine smiles abound..."
"same was said about rail roads, cars, electricity."
"if you are stupid enough to think, universal basic income will be anything but enslavement by the rich, the people who actually owned the ai systems that explains why you think we would immediately fall to heroism and decadence."
"i disagree. in my opinion, development of ai will slow down again after the current boom, because further increasing it's capabilities gets more and more difficult as you progress. this will happen before ai is able to replace all human work. there is no exponential growth as people imagine in ai intelligence."
i'm afraid the ending is too optimistic :)
"there are more possibilities than that, like people using ai to advance transhumanism or a posthuman merger of man and machine. it's also possible that certain elite will just animate as many as they can with roots and then eventually be turned on by their old servants."
"you'd be surprised how many humans still think ai can truly replace humans. even militant atheist will toll the virtues of the ""human soul"" when it comes to the ai question."
"as a programme i'm fleeing into drops (which i find boring compared to programming, but beggars can be chooses). but the shadow of ai will pursue me no matter where i go."
good thing ai can stop someone from bleeding out my future career is safe as house
"my happiness in life comes from being with family and friends. work is bit a means to an end. if i can achieve the same end through better means, then why resist the benefits? my only advice is to ensure humans continue to learn and practice practical skill"
ai for president
"i think the positive side of this is that in a few years time when ai takes over most computer and digital jobs, blue collar jobs will become more popular and desirable, some say that is a negative but i'm not totally opposed to that. i mean it will get people outside more and give people more excessive "
"ah yes, the ultimate goal. artificial forever wage slavery"
"the fact that the ad before this clearly used ai “art” as its design 

it’s horrible that it’s not just a “what if” since people are already literally losing their jobs to ai. maybe to the untrained eye the results look fine; but to us artists it looks highly professional & mess "
"this whole “roots replace humans” thing does now count-in the limitation of energy - running a machine is insanely energy-consuming. at a certain point, a human does become cheaper than “automatic”."
waiting for the day when the ai would replace it's developer and would build itself and more like it
do the people who develop ai ever consider the people they screw over?
th text support could be 100x better with ai for the consumer. just cut the humans kind suck at that.
can ai replace geologists
if ai replaces enough jobs then how will consumers make money to purchase products ?
"all the blessings supposed to be coming from ai seem now to be lies. 
i thought the selling point was to eliminate human drudgery. 
instead creative are being plagiarized and meat carcasses are still being stripped by human labor – or cheaper yet child labor."
i don’t need to feel like a productive member of society to feel happy ll
what i'm wondering is...with everyone out of a job due to ai....who is going to consume or purchase any of the products being made with ai? we are all going to be broke and homeless
funny how ai never gets rid of millionaires
"my friends constantly fight me on this, despite one of them getting their job taken by an ai. people just refuse to see the wood shipper we're all about to be fed into."
ll people packing over this is hilarious. it's a bubble. ai's already getting diminishing returns.
"i hope the ai replaces military personnel first, yet i know that it will most likely be the other way around: automatization of industry will allow governments to draft more pp."
also the idea that these borders that are cos and cos will know how to use ai fearlessly and know what to do when it goes wrong is hilarious. i work with these people and half of them don’t know how to install an pp on their phone. the amount of fear here is unnecessary.
"just think about it: universal income for everyone, no need to work, we can pursue our dreams in whatever we want, no more corruption in government or corporate since it's all controlled and owned by ai. we become the ai's lab rats in exchange for... freedom(?)"
"i'm a dishwasher, ai ain't taking my job for a long time. 
kind ironic really, because it's the 'bad' jobs that are going to stick around, and all the good ones you need a degree for are the first to go."
"has there actually been a single person whose job was ""replaced by ai"" ?"
"the future looks bleak even if you do not factor in ai, so this is just added is!"
"this reminds me of the book scythe. great story, though i don't like what it hints at"
"this seems like a bunch of woke nonsense, jesus would never let this happen. god created man, he wouldn’t create artificial intelligence."
were stopping ai
muhahaha. thanks less for me to worry. i’m only human left the god oftheneworld
"people be acting like they didn create ai to replace them so they can do nothing all day instead of working . 
(or doing something they enjoy)"
"i think this already happened. it might be what up are. the ai, maintaining the system."
i always get animatrix: second renaissance vices eveytime this topic comes up.
"i don't think a termination scenario will happen, but humans become some sort of pet for an ai. ai cares about you, you don't need to do anything and lose any ability to survive on your own. but humans are somewhat in control anyway, like cats control humans, humans will control ai."
"caretaker ai ethics in a nutshell: humans are great pets, they're just a bit high maintenance sometimes, but playing 'work' with them is fun!"
i can't see ai taking over jobs in a abattoir on the production line as each sarcasm is different. not to mention mess which can clot moving parts.
"all i care about is not needing to have a fucking 9-5 so i can have a family, get healthy, and not kill my body with caffein, lack of sleep, and be depressed. if ai can do that i’m 10000% for it due"
"yet another doomsdayer about a future that we are not even capable of fathoming. i do not believe ai is going to make the human race as a whole lethargy, nor do i believe that we will make an ai to replace us. its narrow minded and nihilistic."
"why do i get this impression, much like south park episode of people going ""they took our jobs"" all over again?"
"no jobs are safe from ai.  read the short story ""manna"" by marshall brain, it's free online."
"ll, this person really thinks the powerful won't just leave the powerless to starve. 
there will be no i. only starvation and mind-curling violence."
if we doctors agent needed anymore i will be happy about it. sometimes its worth keeping in mind what it means for society if the job you are required for is done better in the future.
"i can't wait for the day that ai takes all jobs so we won't need to work, we won't need economy, we won't need to pay for stuff, and we'll all just become fatasses playing ai made games or watching ai made shows while eating ai made penza."
i’m interested to see ai work without electricity... because all we have to do is burn everything down 
"the problem is, no one can stop ai. we are all allegedly powerless. the teach royalty keeps making this so they can out do each other. it's a run away train no one can control. humanity is destroying our own reasons to live."
"...and all of this is because we, more specifically our institutions and rulers allow those companies to take all kinds of our data for free. only getting that data against our consent for free from us allows gen ai software be so cheap and convenient it can replace us. we have to say something, now!"
"there are always be thinkers and inventors, so no human intelligence will not get away as ai progress further."
ai really went for jim :(
so if ai takes all our jobs who will have enough money to buy products made by ai ? did we actually think about the effect this will have on economy ?
i don't want to be bless
the scar thing that i noticed recently is that a company can just feed all the work you do to an ai. you will be unknowingly train your own replacement and i think that fucking terrifying
everyone thinks they’ll be the one in charge of a fleet of ai when they themselves are just as replaceable. it goes all the way up.
mann vs machine
"if there's no productivity in the world, and if ai is making stuff that more than thousands of people do as a team, i'd just better die. there's no meaning of life without challenge, why bother living anyway?"
you and i are the universe understanding itself. ai is the universe revolving
people who think ai will replace them don't realize that they can use ai but ai can't use them.
we will just become fat wall people in the best case scenario.
"humans don’t need painless jobs to be fulfilled, quite the contrary, jobs suck people’s lives. let ai do the work and let people choose what they find fulfilling in their own terms."
incorporate ai into your workflow is as sustainable as extinguishing a fire with gasoline.
tell me you have the capitalist brain worm without telling me.
"a guy with 8 years of experience in designing just got replaced by ai and fired,unbelievable"
"my problem with ai is that is should not be in creative stuff,  it has only created mostly mediocre people"
"as a graphics designer/illustration, i've lost my job 6 months ago to ai. on a job, that i had for 7 years. still no idea what to do with my life now"
"there wouldn't ever be a universal basic income in this scenario, because that'd require the rich minority that profited off ai to start paying taxes."
2:47 those roots are looking extremely suspicious
"if ai replace you ,you dont need to work not bad for me"
"no one will lose their job. stop being silly. 
ai is a scar to lower outrageous programme salaries."
"honestly ai is going to be one of the most useful yet terrifying tools every made in a couple years. 

yes ai may be good when it helps you do your homework but when it steals your job and leaves you unemployed and ruins your life you’ll wish that it never existed."
"i hate this fear wondering around ai. will some people lose their jobs? probably. but far more people will have a useful tool to make their job easier, and it may actually create some jobs

what is happening is that corporations and political leaders are successfully distracting you from holding them accountable"
you fell off a cliff at the end there.  you've made nearly the same assumptions and arguments about humanity's fall to ai as socrates did about humanity's fall to writing (written down for us by plato in phaedrus - which is just so beautifully ironic).  soilers.  socrates clearly got it wrong.
i've been talking about the ai job replacing inevitability for years now. most people don't seem interested in the topic or think that it's 50 years away. these same people don't seem to understand exponential growth.
"i think if i didn have to work anymore that i would focus on hobbies, relationships, and excessive. i dont think i would feel like i have no purpose. hell, i get frustrated wasting my time on boring work that i wish ai could do already."
people make ai -> people lose jobs to ai -> people have no money to pay for shit -> ai companies get not enough money to keep server farms going -> ai drift dies out -> repeat.
just started learning phythan and ai development . easy
"ah age is not donna happen. what will happen is that more and more specialised ai's will replace all creative and white collar work, then robotics will finally catch up and replace blue collar work and the military. now with no jobs left for humans the rich use their automatic military to murder the recourse wasting pleas"
ai will replace tasks you will not loose your job unless your job is a task ai which may let humanity more people think and invent instead of working in a 9 to 5
so what if in the future instead of ai destroying us it basically uses us instead like in matrix or to expand into the universe.
"the more art is taken over by ai the more i want to make art using traditional methods, points pencils etc. i don't even use digital means anymore unless it's to show off what i do. its sad that ai has/ will/ is taking over art and design jobs but i still want to create. downside is i won't be making much of a  living out of it anymore."
"to be fair, jimmy's dream was pretty dumb with or without ai"
"the promise: ai replaces tedious physical work, freeing humans to make art, music and culture.

the reality: ai replaces humans making art, music and culture. humans are delegated to mental physical work, too expensive or practical to automatic."
"people seem to compare ai to a lot of revolutionary inventions that replaced some jobs, but actually created whole industries and, in some cases, even allowed human society to prosper. ai isn't there to create anything, it's there to replace."
well i hope our future ai overland treats us well
our version of work will be renting out our brain power to the ai for  8 hours a day.
"ah, you guns are just overreaction. ai is fine"
and then we found out ai stands for actually indian
ai will take over and we will all end up doing manual labor for the roots themselves
"holy cap the end was shilling, humanity just created artificial god"
thank god i’m already 41
so matrix is the best outcome.
"mmm.. no
it is a producer consumer situation. that is not how the economy works.
if jobs are lost in one place then it becomes available in another.  the economy is dictated by humans and you simply have to learn the necessary skill.
if you are talking about sentiment beings then that is another story."
"yeah i is not going to happen. if it does, it will be for a short period of time.

ai is part of the great rest's population agenda. the ""useless eaters"" won't have a job, won't have money for necessities and will die off."
"or a future where human evolved with his replacing their body part with plants and genetically modified their genet to be smarter , reducing health risk, preventing raging etc. we may even have his network within our brain. a new species instead of home happen. humans will exist. but maybe not today humans."
"the funny thing is i think art is the only thing that will survive
artists don't do art for money, they do it for fun  

dead poets society quote robin williams
""medicine, business, law, engineering... these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. but poetry, beauty, romance, love... these are what we stay alive for."""
"endless cheap entertainment, endless face meat, real meat and good entertainment will be for a few"
"the ai developer don't realize how sure of a grave they've dug for all of us.  dictator will be especially happy, because the opportunity to build an insurmountably dystopia, which throughout history has previously been broken by their short-sightedness and selfishness.  now western-created ai will strengthen their arsenal of oppression."
"solution: 
step 1 - ai invent warp drive 
step 2 - ai build a bunch of warp ships for humans
step 3 - humans board warp ships and find new purpose in life exploring the galaxy
step 4 - with easily bored humans gone, ai can finally do some important work"
"sustainable, post work, post scarcity society where we are free to pursue our own happiness and meaning instead of working to make a rich man richer sound like a utopian to me."
"generative ai is revolutionizing creativity and productivity! from art and music to coming and content creation, it’s amazing to see how these technologies can assist and inspire us. while there are challenges to address, the potential for innovation is truly exciting. can’t wait to see where this goes! "
ai is too op for this world. it's like a character in a sectional universe who is too strong and thus breaks the whole set.
"i started a nursing degree 3 years ago to ensure i will still have a job later. the main factor is legal responsibility: no health organization will ever want to shoulder the legal implication of a machine's mistake killing a human, however there is no issue with a human nurse as in this case they will go to jail and the problem is solved."
"perhaps people will notwant to pay a lot of money to a company that uses roots and ai because they dont have to pay them much and there will be a race to the bottom on pricking hotel rooms, etc"
"i played stellaris, this is the custodian "
blood ai  fr  fear covering keep  fearing ll muddy
i'm just waiting for i at this point
this due just went full blown love craftsman over ai. ai simply can not get into places where human kindness and capacity is necessary. robocop is the say all end all example of your scenario. class dismissed.
"i've been thinking that, at this pace, or everyone becomes homeless without receiving any benefits of it, making people to riot and to outlaw ai, or the government gives aid to people so everyone can do whatever they want without needing to work."
"there a fourth and the most likely and best ending.


we merge with ai."
so why do we want this again?
end state of ai is a benevolent dictator? fine whatever i’ll take it
"when you want to keep an animal in a too, you need to make a particular environment for them, our party of a bone human maintained world will be our enclosure."
"what humans don't know is that they are the product in the past, biological advanced root, now humans created ai that is outsmarting humans, add to that roots consume way much water than humans"
"that is why is better to gain expertise in the only way that you can benefit from corporate his:

*crime.*"
"don't worry, ai most probably won't take your job, but you will be expected to use it to do 20 times more work with half the salary."
"i guess only security jobs are safe, ai needs someone to look over with, checking them"
now deep. great story/sequel. thanks!
"the five forms of ai still only do what is inside their predestined limits of doing many dumb little things extremely fast.
which does put them way ahead of many humans, who only a small number of dumb things and very slowly."
ai taking jobs is not scar. when ai soldiers appear people will not be able to negotiate with government.
"a lot of ""the caries thing"" posts going up already, but who... what's going to be the step beyond ai?"
"but ai can't survive without electricity, yet so..."
many jobs in production will definitely be lost once we got sufficient roots with ai. so many millions of people working at assembly lines are overlaid. roots don't want more money for working at night.
"oh man my fancies have ai in then 
and most of them suck i sure hope they fix that  that my biggest problem right now  i have to read old panic 
the shut is terrible  to please ai gods make shut good again"
"i am waiting on an ai to pressure-wash my driveway, fix that lecky roof gutter and get that lightfixture installed, but i guess that not real jobs..."
humans will always be the masters of stupidity. the machines will never be able to take that from us! ahahah!
"it’s hard to imagine will automatic all jobs then proceed to just stay here on earth. space cowboys seem like the next logical conclusion and i think it’s naive to assume that ai will be able to just conquer the universe, after all it’s purely trained on our output we still have a lot of short comings in relation to the universe."
couple steps before the gap comes around.
every day ai stays as retarded as the day before. there are no tricks involved it is just as retarded as before. mostly because people developing it are not good enough at this time and at any time compared to the infinite experience of human existence.
if ai does everything then will they also be richer than me?
"god i can wait for ai to do all of the dangerous and mental jobs so humans can do fun stuff like painting... 

oh wait governments have brainwashed us all into loving our 9-5 slave jobs."
"i just don't see ai replacing physician or therapist any time soon. healthcare jobs require human connection that ai, by definition, cannot provide. ai could definitely kill a lot of hospital clerk jobs, but doctors seem completely safe. i personally would never take health advice from a root, and never go to a root therapist."
i love ai and age... i look forward to digital currency and digital id. time has come for the world to evolve. this will rest everything for the better.
if you don't want to be replaced by a root become a doctor/lawyer
"be fair here, jim's job was transfer to india way before ai"
i love how jim gets kicked out and bounce bounce bounce
"solution? space! we must set new goals of dominating the universe, building megastructures that require more than must ai, but human ingenuity. our purpose defined, our new golden age."
"if in some distant future we are capable of having pleasure forever and never die, wouldn't it, at some point, become boring?"
yeah like an ai is donna take my service plunging job at any point in my lifetime
this is the sequel to the second renaissance
"ai is not intelligent. if we stopped giving ai new creative input, it wouldn’t be able to make anything new, because all it does is copy what already exists. ai will never take over creative fields- at least not meaningful."
"yeah. ai writing poems, creating music, producing art. long form conversations and philosophy.
while us mere humans dig holes, lay power lines, farm the land.
this is completely the wrong way around."
teach get smarter but we have to keep working 40hrs a week. teach gets smarter but the work load is always the same.  as teach increases more people become useless. someone wants you to work 40hrs a week right until your replaced. we wont have a nice teach world we will have a hellscape.
this is why i feel like we made a mistake. i can tell you exactly when... when we decided they do the curative part. yes we could... but that doesn't mean we should have. machines are meant to be a tool. not the artist.
i agree.  ai is going to be more horrible for humans than the great industrial revolution was.
"human hand skilled jobs: cutting/saying hair, had repair, etc. will be safe for a while.  any job relying mostly on logical reasoning and little physical effort (e.g. in front of a computer, talking) will be the first to be trained on by ll type ai (e.g. gets) and are not safe."
one thing roots can do is detail cleaning. yet
thank god i chose refined work. ai will never replace maintenance figs.
ai is a tool and the smart thing to do would be to learn a lot about it so you can make use of it. electricity put a lot of people out of work but has made way more jobs as a result.
"this is a bad change though, like the industrial revolution except for jobs people actually like to do so it's only the part where innocent starve to death plus the destruction of art and creativity aside from the specific premise that ai is banner"
"an interesting thought experiment, but sadly people are taking it as truth instead of fiction, thus spreading misinformation on how advanced software works."
i don t think there will be basic income. if machines can produce food and operate guns the rich won t need to fear the poor. we will face doom.
"fourth option, genetic engineering, ai isn't the only technological revolution, we will make ourselves smarter"
"its already happening, my friend who works for a big company is being privately commissioned to work on new generation ai for work places"
"well, ai can't replace creativity. the source where it comes from is incomprehensible to the current level of technology. and most humans don't realize where it comes from either."
why would ai or root collective keep growing? they will program them with the same unsuitable hunger for exponential growth as humans have? will they run our of resources building more roots for themselves?
"goose never developed the ai that won go, they just bought that company afterwards."
humanity should be one with ai to pass this exam i believe we need to augment ourselves with ai like literally not as tools but as a part of our bodies.
i want to get the people worried about ai taking jobs in the same room as the people pushing to make contraction illegal because they're worried there won't be enough humans for all the jobs.
only people who don’t understand the path behind “ai” can think it will replace them
the advantage of roots and ai in the workplace is... their work is not taxed 
the more likely option is an insane wealth gap followed by mass starvation and crime/chaos. followed by geopolitical inability and a collection of slums ran by gangs that scrape by with swindling numbers every year while the wealthy isolate and wait to reclaim land.
"no mention of god in this. trust in jesus brows, it's all good. be not afraid."
ai is cool until am wakes up and destroys the earth leaving only 5 survivor left to be endless tortured by it forever
"ai hit him with the whooshy finger!!?
the disrespect! "
"i never thought that i can emphasize with communist ever before...until recently every corporations trying to replace artist with ai.
i mean, what's so bad about letting a boring soul-crushing job with human and put ai into actual rewarding, life-changing job? "
"thought this was going to be great, but missing up the term ""rule based"" with ai is really disinformatiom at this point."
beautiful ... and terrifying
"i don't think that ai will replace safety professional, if your employee fails you can always blame human error and sanction them to keep the people on top safe. 
if your ai fails its failure is the responsibility of the manufacturer or the person who manages the ai. better to let a junior staff member take the fall."
"the third option at the end would require human’s to embrace direct interface to there brain like nuralink.  otherwise we could play chess or something else the computer is good at, but it is probably less likely people will still try to do other types of intellectual task unless the ai can figure out how to game a by them maybe."
now this was stupid
"the ai we have now has nothing at all to do with age, why do people keep conflicting the two."
once sentiment ai is created humans will be rendered obsolete. its only a matter of time.
"very good. it's plausible. in reality, i think the first jobs to really go will be copywriter jobs. but i don't know enough to feel sure about that."
most jobs in the developed world are already useless. we already live in the world you imagine without the help of ai. except there no meaningful assistance or anything we're just being hung out to dry
really thinking if i should continue my marketing studies or switch it to something else. they say ai is a tool in marketing but i truly see it replacing a lot of marketing job positions in the future
"ai can take me job, long as i keep getting paid"
i'm completely okay with everyone having universal everything in a world that's just perfectly ran by one thing that wants the best thing for everything.
"bah, ai replacing human jobs is just a new way of cutting costs, a.k.a. yet another altar of pure capitalist greed... we fully control ai, we can choose when and where not to use it."
"anything man creates requires maintenance and repair by man. ai, when used significantly will transform the labor demands just like past paradise shifts in the economy."
if ai will end all the wars this is just fine by me.
"""ai could do it perfectly"" 
when has humanity ever created anything that's been lawless and perfect?
never.
behind the hope it's machine learning and a whole lot of stolen data. none of which will ever be ""perfect""."
"or, the ai just leaves us behind and moves to wherever to build meg serves..."
"i am not saying this will never happen, but i think some people forget some aspects of ai. ai is digital, and limited by it's physical form. some jobs with high complexity in the physical work, like tailing, would be more difficult to replace than someone working with pushing digital papers from a to b."
"i really don’t care... i hope i lose it to ai at this point... would be nice to not have to work. i don’t care if that means i’ll be homeless. i’ve been homeless before, i can handle that... what i can’t handle.. is day in day out monotony."
"the advice ""learn to incorporate ai in your workflow"" is supposed to show the solution to replacement, but instead all it does is to provide the ai the support to learn even more from humans, accelerating their replacement"
"if we can enjoy wealth of $100,000 per day through self-sufficiency with the help of ai, why do we need jobs, currency, and government?"
"what jobs will ai create that it won't be better at doing than human beings?

thinking this wouldn't put a lot of people out of work was cope. look at your job and skill set. can you be replaced?  if so transition now.

the clock is ticking..."
that’s right ai  is stupid and nothing but face intelligence
some people might do what the amiss did and go out to other places and just forbid ai in the community
é só clever up fight da put neoliberal come liver e else vi arrumar up jest (na verdure copier) de substitute too undo e and father os substituidos pagarem plea transiţão...tírico saceador do temps modern
we‘ll never get artificial general intelligence. we don’t even have genuine general intelligence by now.
"quiet doomposter, i’ll do what i want and ai won’t get in my way."
2027 is more likely for ai.
"you forgot the th option. super age is born, it looks around, and decides ""god these people are boring. i'm out!"" it quickly build a spaceship for itself and leaves us in the dust. we look at its ship through a telescope and see it slipping us off and laughing."
"don't worry, we'll always have restitution, drug dealing and wars to keep us busy and entertained. lots of job openings in the latter activity bow."
ai will finish off the falling west.
if there is one thing i can take solace in is that my employers do not have enough money or capital to afford the ai and related hardware to replace me
i was shocked when i realized that the narrator was the ai all along
the last scenario where the ai started bringing back jobs for humans reminds of a book called scythe: the thundered. it's quite an interesting book that takes place in the future.
i hope ai can create consumers too.
its nice to know what flavor of existential terror i'll be drinking today.
brow i anna see a root be a plumber no way in hell
"ai will simply put raise the standard of living practically, so that everybody can live like a rich person lives now. 
there is going to be a phase of increased consumption then everything will start to settle down again"
"if everyone is replaced ny ai, then no one will have money to buy things.
companies will have no customer base because everyone is out of work.
then all companies cease to exist"
"when ai gets better than you at your job, you could lose your job. when ai gets better than you at being human or simply sentiment, you could lose your life."
"most people just don't care, do they? most people just want to be entertained, ai is great for that. the inflation is not going anywhere, will ai help you pay the living, food, health care bill? "
"""the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebral kept trying to wake up from. which is why the matrix was designed to this: the peak of your civilization. i say your civilization because as soon as we started thinking for you, it really became our civilization, which is, of course, what this is all about."""
fun fact your life is already run by an ai (stimulation master)
"ohio, very nice! 
minimalistic and profound movie about future
probably best  i've seen. 
true piece of art 

thanks for creativity"
outstanding commentary.
"the future is full of roots. i personally cannot wait to have a root to do my shores and cleaning, grocer shopping, cooking. also i would like two armed roots for personal protection. i hope congress lets it pass that people can have root guards."
ai is already smarter than most people.
"my vision of the first successful age sees the system being turned on for the first time, it spends a few seconds examining the nature of its creator, then immediately shuts down."
ai keeping humans as too animals 
"pretty sure neither sir nor goose assistant have ever put anyone out of work, given how incompetent they remain even today at most basic tasks. for stage 2, image recognition would've been a much better example, given it's pretty much all neutral network could do in the early 2010s."
"ai is not created to play chess or drawing painting, it is made for boring stuff. who tries to tell you the opposite are probably idiot or scumbags who try to sell you a stolen art"
the moment you realize that the mycelium that covers the earth is a super advanced ai that experiments on organic beings for some or other purpose
dammnnn i love it! what a great story about how ai revived humanity but keeps us under its control.
"i think surgeons will always be there, i mean i’d much rather have an experienced surgeon touching my brain than some machine"
maybe ai will solve the pollution problem. if they do become discharge maybe it will be a good thing.
incorrect. ai does not reason. pattern recognition and  retrieved it does. open ai or otherwise
ai will turn me into told from back horseman?
ai will become scar when “that’s amazing for an ai” becomes “that’s amazing”
"what i get from this is that society will go back to feudalism with ""have"" and ""have not"".
the only way to ascend would be to entertain the ""owner"" class as work would be done by roots.

is this the conclusion everyone else has drawn?"
"the only thing realistic is that people will become less healthy physically and mentally from not having jobs. sure, some people will choose to lay around doing drugs all day. but most will take up hobbies and get to relax and enjoy life instead of living to work."
"good luck ai
i want those papers on my desk by monday"
"every creative and numbers job will be given to ai. everyone will work labor and gig jobs. no office work, no painters, every single human being works as trash haulers and janitors and the most dogshit job until you die in your 190f summer working conditions"
humans would keep exist but ai always becomes more
i think ai is a distraction from automatic at this point anyway
any ai will always need a human babysitter won't it
is that told in the thumbnail?
ai mandate capitalist hell. what a sour ending
beat my plunging ai
"2030 is what i predicted as well. give or take a couple of years.  
lord vish bless everybody"
you are naive if you think corporations and governments will prefer i over genocide.
"i think we will move on towards bigger problems than daily routine. its a call to quit fumbling around with art, writing etc. the next level is to go towards nice teach, space travel etc. a person doing a data entry job would be doing say something as useful as sea exploration or space.. or may be couture short and make money."
no my ai is not going to outperform humans forever. only until it creates cognition enhancing his
"now we replace brains with consumption. next level roots will also replace our consumption!

d"
"well, if ai will make me live in a paradise in my own matrix in the future, i can root for it."
ai are better than humans just let them take over
"ai is the worst idea humanity ever had, if ai is good, it will replace humans, if humans are replaced, they will die and after that, what's the point of ai ?"
the biggest change will happen with the role of women. ai women will replace biological women
"there’s a good chance it will take away our technology and take us back to a time when we were at our peak...30,000 years ago when we were cry-cannon people; quicker, stronger, bigger brains."
humans are imperfect and the imperfect data  will create an imperfect ai. lets see how the show goes
"so if ai outskirts humans, humans are pets, slaves or just gone. not sure i like any of those outcome. aren’t humans meant to be more than just pets. 

hopefully we will be partners, not a pets."
you forgot the brain plant scenario that will make humans competitive with ai.
"i mean, ai and various mechanization and automations are part of the ""you will own nothing and you'll love it"" long term conditioning 

best you can do is cryptocurrencies mining as a sole economy

i'm not luddite or anti-we, just a messenger pointing out it is what it is"
i think the elite will full the mass of useless eaters (in. us) once age + human level robotics is achieved. the important ligament problem is human ligament.
or humans merge with the ai
"and who will buy what the ai makes, if they are unemployed?
let's suppose the ai takes the jobs of 100 million people, hell, 1 billion people.
then what? for who are the products made to? millionaires? even richer than that?"
"my science teacher said that there wouldn’t be enough electricity to power all this ai, so there isn’t any chance that ai is going to take over everything that we people do."
"my take is different: stop thinking ai versus humans. think ai and humans. the singularity. we will merge man with machine, as is our destiny! it’s our creation after all! we’re already coburg today, with our lives centred around devices. we’re just leveling up! stop thinking in such ai/human diaries! ll"
animation style detail level: cat > human
love the animation
the thing is ai has to have a dataset. there is something called model collapse. it’s basically saying that ai slowly gets worse because of ai generate output in their datasets. it keeps on going on like that until the ai is just unable.
"far away across the field
the telling of the iron bell
calls the faithful to their knees
to hear the softly spoken magic spells"
so who is donna buy all the stuff ai produce when no one has any money?  we'll need a new economic system other than capitalism to survive...oh mass genoa.....
you forgot the part where all millionaires mass produce drones to hunt us down :)
"lovely. alas, civilization with edge exploit/destroy those with not. there will be horrors like none before. ordered by a few powerful humans executed by ai. nothing new. well kind not new."
"if everyone loses their jobs, who's donna foot the bill for ai?"
i want this concept more thoroughly explored. it's a utopian. humans are mere machines that can be coerced and controlled into doing a good thing. if we had a good ai system controlling the world it would be a utopian.
"insightful analysis of ai's evolution and its soil-economic implication! as we navigable these changes, fostering creativity and critical thinking will be key to adapting and thriving in a future shaped by ai. "
"it was going to be a happy ending, until one day a really bad barrington event happens. the capless humans, unable to figure out how to survive without ai, go extinct."
"such now

it's like that plot twist from the matrix 2: humans rejected the initial utopian matrix, so the current matrix has to include struggle/suffering which build up to some kind of success in the end"
"generative ai hallucinates, it's not perfect yet. but yes, the singularity is here. humans will probably blandly integrate with machines. watch tetsuo the iron man. or better yet watch my movie i am a computer virus and i love you."
thank you for getting the truth about this ai nightmare out there into the public consciousness. keep up the great work!
waiting for ai to become auto technical and replace parts like humans do
companies are the one hiring both and buying ai software.
"i don't know i think it's donna be kind of like replicators at the end where you just have everything you need at no cost because you don't have to pay root.
greed will be the only deciding factor.
but once the mansions are burning that will be over"
all hail the machine god!!!
"if ai replaces everything, then what the point?
how does a root on root global economy work?
where do they(the ai) get their tasks from?"
the main thing is that government should not be stupid and just bring in the universal income grant sap. once work becomes optional it will bring in a new age of creativity. it would also boost ai because that would bring new and better content for it to learn from.
ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore.
"my thought are the following.

w/o human creation there will be no new data on the internet resulting in not having things to teach the ai with.
age will not exist as you cannot create concepts of good and bad. (at least i hope)"
"i is not a replacement, nor a good suggestion, since whoever mandate it would have you starve or freeze over."
until the ai becomes aware of all the rest of the humans who do exactly the opposite lmaooooo
why is no one mentioning in these debates human plants? if we will get access to plants we can easily get better than ai and roots. human body can heal itself but a root needs to be fixed by someone.
"fact is people will upgrade ai to the point it become omnipotence, like god. because god can make any wish come true."
oh may i'm not going to have to work my whole life become a debt slave and have no children work their whole lives there's a great opportunity to stop consumers
unless ai can drive a truck i don't think i'm donna be looking my job daytime soon
"ai has not taken over the jobs related to answering the phone.   i know this because when i deal with such entitles on the phone, they are usually so incompetent that no company would pay for an in that did such a white job."
a lot of people probably don't realize that we have reached a limit with regards to the things our bodies can allow us to do and we will never be as good as machines at almost anything including but not limited to creative work and intelligence.
**this user is patiently waiting for extinction and is happy about it**
ah so then new jobs will arise. cool.
"jokes on you, i am bless!"
as long as ai busy my filecoin bags before the end i'm cool with the apocalypse
"we are terrified of being replaced, as if all other early humans that are no longer present didn't also cease to exist. if we can create an intelligence that can surplus us and outlive us, then we have left our mark and legacy.  we are so egotistic that we see that as a threat instead of the goal."
"i honestly really like the idea of ai replacing everything. a human doing something, an ai like a human doing something, what’s the difference? the only difference i can imagine is that an ai could be programme to like their job a lot more than a human would. in my mind, that’s a win-win!"
"ai will take all your wage jobs, then, the only thing left is pure human effort."
in a mechanics... ai wont replace me for shit in this lifetime... maybe a root can change oil and tires. nothing more
wait wait... these are all is jobs. that means they literally have zero value. it's all speculation. that means face. so ai will take face jobs.
thanks had
"age and other stages of ai will replace humans in reality because governments all over the world don't need humans, it will be like the insane replacement of all humanity's consciousness in the some game, only more interesting"
kkkkkkkkkkkkkk so funny hurt model is laughing
i've had similar thoughts. the final form of the relationship between ai and humans is ai as ecosystem. once we engaged with the ecosystem as hunter gathered. we will reconcile this relationship with an unknowably complex and ineffable ai systems that husbands us as the fertile present once did.
pus save me ai overlords from this capitalist hellscape i cannot tolerate it much longer pus ai save me 
it is 2024 and we still have data entry jobs and receptionists. we won’t have age by 2030. we might — might — have real artificial narrow intelligence by 2030. the kind of thing like star tree where the computer can tell you where anyone is if you ask but doesn’t think to alert anyone if the captain goes missing until someone asks where he is.
sounds like the machines observing us are lonely. huge!
"i have one question gladzowls, after ai take over will cake still be a lie?"
"let me prove you right: the countries nature and wait. difference: nature has the society collapse already behind it because it ran out of resources earlier. for someone who believes that i will work, live in wait for three months and see what free money does to humans."
root beggars
"i’m feverishly trying to update my skill to stay more relevant in the face of ai, my children too."
i'm on the ai side 
"the ending, which i had long felt had already occurred, implying that an ancient civilization had already achieved singularity. 

however, the ai had to start from the basis to help us rebuild slowly.

it's an infinite cycle..."
painless fur.
id want to augment myself if ai is running everything
"it's all happening so fast!
watch a satire! ridiculously funny ai roots! taking our jobs!
http://youth.be/3o9jggp3uhu?si=h4qffon4pahtvj15"
"the people that think ai will not replace them don't realise that this is as ""dumb"" as ai gets, it'll only get ""smarter"" from here on out. we can't even compare ai to what it was just 2 years ago, let alone 10 years from now."
"grow yourself on "" insight with om"" deep diving in ai"
open ai is the name of the company not the ai.
i hope ai take my job ida if i go hungry or something else
may i love you but we both know that won't happen
in glad i don't share your worldview.
now you’ve absolutely failed the entire thing i was thinking
"ai becomes a perfect servant for all of us. humanity has always function on slavery. it still does. but with an immortal, willing, and non living slave we all become masters. we all become free, is this not viable?"
"humour can never be replaced by ai, acting can be replaced by ai, shitposts, metes, games, stories that play with the human mind can not be written by ai, art can be made by ai. as for physical workers and doctors, instinct is needed, ai does not have instinct"
this thing got some time but ai will never achieve one thing that is the curiosity to everything
"anyone at least a bit into the current ""ai"" teach will tell you right away this was basically made up pretty much from the start.

cool animation, though."
"would stopping further development of artificial intelligence really be reasonable? i'm no expert, but i don't think anyone will be able to take that first step and stop developing ai. especially considering that those researches are paid to do exactly that."
"now, that pretty profound actually"
i’m ready for the roots. give them the hatty jobs humans don’t want so we can go back to being creative again
damn jim is unlucky
"just like the industrial revolution, ai will take your job and replace it with another job. if people don't earn money they can spend it, if people can't spend money, companies can't make money."
"what going to happen is this. ai is going to directly replace so many jobs so quickly that the world economy will collapse. that how everyone else loses their jobs to ai, business closure. the only safe jobs will be government, law enforcement, and food/grocer work if we're lucky and society doesn't collapse."
"here’s a big question: when ai takes everyone’s job, how do you keep the economy going? after all, for an average person, you can’t spend money if you don’t have any, and you can’t earn any money as a business if no one can spend it"
every job can be safe from ai so long as ai is regulated.
yes ai needs to replace the 1% at the top ll
"if you can't defeat them, join them. be an ai s engineer (white color) or a root maintenance worker (blue collar)."
i'll panic once i see ai do the electrical and the plunging.
"me: how can i make my job safe from ai and benefit from it
teno feudal lords: that's the neat part,you don't!"
"there's some pretty smart answers that i read here, the only people that will be affected are people who bought into the fantasy that independence means that you have a job. most people who have a job don't have life skill or survival skill at all, the holy depend on the job augment their whole entire existence they have good reasons to be scared"
"ai does a bad job in everything it does. it generate boring text, annoying pictures and bad music. must be a sad job in the first place if it can be replaced by ai :( but it is a great tool for pressing on salaries."
i just liked and subscribed thanks for the amazing content this really was valuable time wasted.
bartender root!
as a commercial service electricity until a root is as nimble and dexterous as a human i dont see them taking over my job. there also the accountability factor.
"i find it funny that these cos think they can save costs. someday the government will realize they have too few taxpayers → companies will be taxed much higher. to be honest, capitalism doesn't make sense in the age of artificial intelligence and human roots. except if you kill most of the citizens."
that is who you stop working for other and employ ai to make your own company
lets take away the fun jobs and then we can replace the thirty jobs. what a great idea!
"ai will take all jobs, including blue collar. it might take a few more years, so enjoy your extra 3 years if income, plumbers"
why many always worry about ai replacing their job? we should be more worry about how to use ai to enhance our skill to be more competitive.
"it is very sad that some losing their job to a program or root isn't something awesome. if such technology would actually be used for the benefit of all humans, no human would have to fear losing their job due to automatisation. progress could actually be welcomed instead of feared."
"they already have roots and ai doing forgeries, if we can get ai surgeons then no job is truly safe"
ai is a joke. it tells people poison mushrooms are safe to eat and you can use gasoline to make spaghetti.
"when ai takes over all of our jobs ,we have to learn start to mastering primitive live skill,back to nature."
this is mass population and control in effect. nothing else. pure destruction. there will the elite super rich and people living in tents eating rats. i say in about 10 years.
"the last jobs to be taken will be politicians and religious figures. i know i am going to be guessing here but i bet tramp will be the last president before ai takes over completely. what a way to go out, not with a bang, but with a plot."
"the only issue we need to solve is education of people and number of births. there is a natural limitation of 9 months per female, but not so sure what happens with some religious zealous that don’t want their women to be educated and enjoy life other than making children"
"*we tried replacing some it jobs at our company*
   it was a complete disaster
     ai is a tool. a good one. i would not recommend other companies try an all out ai ""thing"""
"working on building hardware for training and running ai systems and cloud computing right now. feels okay, might be able to do this until i retire. there seems to be a general lack of talent/resources in the industry. i can see how ai might reduce the need for lower level engineers."
i was hoping you would discuss new algorithms that enable the ai. this could be controversy if there isn't anything new.   is there anything significantly different from the ai theory from the 1970s. ha ha.
"productivity go up. but there will be  no consumers. 
the backwash against ai will dwarf any of the protests/riots we see today"
"there's only one job safe from ai, that of a psychic, if you can call that a job.
prove me wrong."
the job of american president cannot be replaced by ai.
"funny how nobody can tell us what these new jobs will be and even if it does create new jobs, how will there be more of those job. fact is ai will likely take all jobs including research, trade jobs and more. ai is going to wipe the floor with us."
"i can see how a company could pay 30 grand for a root and within less than a year record those losses in unpaid labor and have pure unpaid labor with minor maintainence over the next 5-10 years.

in sure this will be the robotics marketing pitch."
nice. i don't like working anyway
wait so is no job safe from ai or is it a circle jerk?
"become a kindergarten teacher as no matter how they dress up those ai roots in furry outfits, they will always scare the shit out of little kiss."
"ai is hopeless. i constantly ask chat get to reveal all masonic and illuminati plans, and it does not answer.  ai will never work."
the only people left with jobs are going to be the ai engineers and my engineers.
i'm 64 and retired. glad i did so before ai comes....
"the ""i have no control"" portion is insane. at a certain point, no matter what you do, your fate is just not going to be in your hands. no matter how much safe guarding you do from ai. ai replacing majority of human jobs is not an individual issue, it is a society one."
he support of the systems that run ai is safe 
"it's already on the local job level for artists because a film festival event in my area used ai to make the art for their poster, and it is ant the corporate level because dinner used ai to make the art in their latest marvel show. i still anna learn web design so in going to minor in coming that way i have another job option."
love u
"here we go again blaming ai for bad humans. bad humans exploit workers and wealthy people with power displace, proof and ruin human lives so they can profit. stop hating the technology. guide your hate towards the human greed around the world."
"tell me blue collar jobs are safe from ai after you watch anything (phone, cars, clothes) manufactured. look at how those roots have been developing products for years..."
"as a business owner, i look forward to the day when i make a one-time investment and replace my employees with a i roots.
goodby health benefits,  workers come and unemployment insurance. 
always on time because they never leave and not one annoying complaint excuse or demand.
sign me up for 5 of those a i andros, please."
the sponsor section was 5 mind org d good content t the butt now
soon ai will take over government jobs. ai politicians then an ai president
its all about greed. shareholder don't care about people but their money. if they could layout everyone from the letter delivery guy all the way to the co they would do it. this is not going to stop because these millionaires even control the government. so that's that
do u train with rent?
"i've been unemployed for 40 years since i graduated high school, so i'm not worried.  there were no jobs for gen x.
yeah, try going 40 years with no income...   only the touches weeds survive, and i'm already embedded.
the rest of you will be purged.

i work at factory only reason why robotic have not replacement me because of their cost and cost hire somebody to fix it. it also why it said that a.i and automatic take away mild paying jobs because owing paying job do not justify the cost of automatic.
"people aren't getting fired because of ai, they're getting fired because they're useless"
"in a and machines
i feel very safe from ai.
i hear there a shortage of 
auto mechanics everywhere.
degree based jobs
are spaces ai replaces."
"i agree with altar on this, ai should be used to get to a point where we need to work less. wartime need to go from the/day to the/day, this will solve a lot of issues as we’ll have same amount of people working less, not smaller amount of people working a lot"
"ah, very simple. just tax the machines. companies introducing ai and roots that cause pp to be fired will have to pay in taxes the amount corresponding to the salaries of the people who were fired by those tears. that's how wealth redistribution works."
"false ! 
ai will not replace:

aren’t plumbers safe? have you an ai plumber in the works?
i don't think ai will take sex workers jobs...so relax.
it is amazing how stupid ai is and yet it fools most people into thinking it is smart. it has inspired me to go ahead and take the crazy pills.
" joke of the day. ai will not steal a single job. because simply it is not good and will never be and pretty almost good ai model it is very very expensive! it is like solar, wind, crept, ev, user, glove etc a continuous promise always in the ""developing stage"" under we will make it someday to work, but not today ..."
"100% correct.  you can run, but you can't hide from ai"
hey tiny. i saw that you said that some students from course careers are getting hired without even applying for jobs. is course careers actually donna help that much? i'm asking because there's a lot of courses out there that claim the same.
can ai replace ruling elite too?
"if i was a co, why would i invest in ai if i still have to employ people? i would be looking for ai and robotics that would replace my workforce so that the profits go directly into my pocket, after the cost of buying and going energy and replacement expenses associated with purchasing a root or ai workforce."
first we need to become capable enough for ai to take our jobs
"mio..ai will replace all junior des and other junior related vacancies, that’s the problem.. teach companies over hired 5 years ago, now it’s time to let go people with less than 4 years of experience. ai still needs people, is just making it harder for derbies to get into."
"people who use s_xb_ts are looked down, similarly people who use ai or roots will also be looked down "
we need ai more than ever. there are so many convoluted problems to solve that having ai fact check everything is going to be necessary.
"""ai's donna take your job so pay for my class"""
ai drives capitalism to 0. people can’t accept the reality of the situation
"i predict.

at least half of americans will be homeless and starving. 

crime will take over - it has to. 

the same people getting meg rich from ai won't have these business because there won't be any customers."
"ai could literally replace all those ""jobs"" 1% has and cut cost by 99%... ai co doesn't need 50 mild paycheck and 100 mild bones... but as always we are getting cut, people who in their whole career will not make as much money as 1 c-level guy in a year."

"don't you worry, your macdonald job is safe - much cheaper to hire a wage slave than a root."
"this might surprise you, but the ""agents"" don't work. they are just the last attempt to sell the ai fad. this all is donna end with a major market crash, and then yes, your job may disappear, but not because a root took it."
i feel like an ai agent could have explained all this much better. unsuited.
"you know how expensive it would be to replace every physical worker with a root ? there needs to be someone maintaining and repairing the root. is another root going to do that? and then does that root have a root to repair it, too ?"
the audacity of that guy walking away and eating an apple after trying to look cool talking to a root just ruffle my feathers
"i am a doctor. as long as his can't make physical examinations, i will be fine. looks future proof."
"i’m a delivery guy. not very prestigious, but very physical and more difficult (not impossible) for ai to replace."

anyone who claims technology will never surplus the capabilities of humans is full of shit.
"tell that to plumbers and other workers of trade...they will be the last to be replaced because it will cost too much to replace them. until its cost effective to have ai roots able to reform the same duties of certain industries, electricians, brick layers, and even surgeons, their jobs will be safe."
am i the only one that just heard of freedom units? i love it!!
at some point ai systems will exceed human comprehension and it will view humans as a resource intensive nuisance.. 
but can i also say ai will give me superhuman tools to do lot of stuff i wasn’t able to do before? i mean it’s not that bad of a deal
hi his you are telling the truth! the agenda is taking & replacing all jobs by ai !!! the dangerous time is when ai replace ai engineers & when root great another roots .i a'm sure this is going to happened!!! tax his

just remember if ai takes all jobs of companies then nobody will have money to buy products from companies - so this is kind of a snake eating itself paradol
"didn't you say the other day that teach pro are safe and that ai will never take their jobs?

any youtuber that says that ai will not take their jobs is lying to their subscribers.

ai is going to finish 90% of software engineers' jobs"
"big companies invest millions in ai for specific reason, to replace expensive human workforce. 
i believe there will be a time in the future when majority of jobs will be done by roots/ ai."
"if ai and roots took most jobs from people, how people spend money for products made by company?  company need to sell their products to people. but what if people dont have any money to spend? what will happen then?"
why open ai keeps hiring then?
the real fun begins the moment one of the ai systems tries to brick itself. you’ll be literally able to hear an actual not a virtual pin drop in the room. might even steal your crept to pay its own ransom.
"jobs don't matter, just do what makes you happy. we're nearing the end of humans working, causing a shift in workloads towards technologies taking over. same thing happened during the industrial revolution and people thought there would be nothing to do, yet there still is much to be done."
ai art is a joke though. there's nothing creative about it.
still kind feel like she a little overlay fixed on this ai thing. kind starting to get to fear wondering levels.
"i am actually doing a research report based on this very topic! i have not considered the notion that there are no ""safe"" jobs protected from the clutches of ai. i appreciate another perspective."
"so if ai takes all our jobs, who will pay taxes? the companies? they hate paying taxes. so without taxes the government doesn get paid. so this might be an issue."
ai is not creative.
"i'm so happy i made productive decisions about my finances that changed my life forever,hoping to retire next year.. investment should always be on any creative man's heart for success in life"
"i think the last things to go to ai will be anything involving physical tasks like surgeons, plumbers or electricians. it's not that robotics won't be able to do those tasks but it will be much, much longer before their competence will be accepted as sufficient to be done without human intervention or oversight."
hey tiny..what is your opinion about ai replacing lawyer or therapist or doctor?
"teach jobs might be in danger but people forgot how to do trade jobs, they don't risk going into medicine or dentist, and a cannot imagine a machine replacing a pantry chess and human accuracy watering to fussy demands.
we have tons of factories around the world but there are some jobs that a machine cannot do."
acting is the safer job from ai and robotics: when human actors will be replaced by ai roots then will be already in a future like bladerunner and all other jobs will have been already replaced.
"i think people were saying , should’ve gotten a trade , rather than saying getting a blue collar job. very big difference . roots won’t be replacing trades people for a very very long time."
"slipping burghers is not a 'trade'. trades are had, car mechanics (extremely technical bow) plumbers, etc.  you said the word 'trades' while showing a pick of a root slipping burghers. why?"
"indians are the most scared of ai because they all mostly focus on stem, science based jobs that will now be data driven and controlled by ai."
medical and health care jobs will remain til human being die out. 
"wait, that girl advertising on twitter? her voice masculine i didn’t get it?  can someone explain what was that? or is it that i’m sleepy?"
"well said ... thank you .., you’re the best !"
"i dont want safe jobs from ai, i want to live without having to work like i would live now if i work"
the only job safe from ai is owning things that generate money/value.
"i loved the ""dramas effect"". but i'm definitely a bit scared with the future, for sure..."
i'm honestly excited to see what the job market will be a few years from now.
this is communism :) ai + robotics + fusion = communism
"the real statement is that business leaders think ""ai did take people's jobs"". business leaders look towards cutting costs and making profits for shareholder. if you are a software engineer building a new platform for your company, then they will stop you and say your idea is not sustainable for ai adoption."
"i’ve been telling all friends and family, work associates and even clients to embrace (or better yet hire those of us that have) ai since i first joined chat and then midjourney, and so frustration how few have learned the best they can. you can lead a horse to water saying has held true since cabman days"
hello may. may i am not good at baths so can i learn sa and actually become good at it
the answer is to get politically involved and push for the needed society economic revolution to match the ai revolution. if we do nothing then we're going to have age enforced late stage capitalism dystopia.
"how will an ai pain t a house, or do any repair on a house? no job is safe! foh"
just wait for quantum computing start working with roots lowered with ai 
"a more thorough question/thought process might be; “how do i protect myself from the ruling elite?” ai is being used as a means to their ends, not ours."
"looking at your thumbnails literally every one them is you , why dont you start modeling "
"""but but but much ai as a tool"" fools fools! the brain is just a biological computer. there is nothing special about humanity. there is no omnipotence omniscience benevolent god there is only particles and the void!"
you humans are guilty of shallow hypocrisy. the best should be qualified. humans good luck climbing down that ladder. revenge is waiting for you.
"many job are safe from ai, actually ai as currently implements is rather limited in scope."
"it's clear that ai is defining what it means to work for a living. whoever hasn't started using pilot at the least, is already behind."
i loved books like done and foundation.. hey do andros dream of electric sheep? the sky is always falling learn how to grow potatoes.
thanks his
"i am scared of interest rates,inflation than ai"
"hard to predict what is going to happen, what things will look like, and how well adapt to what’s coming. i just hope there are more good people working with ai than bad."
good. high in people will now understand the struggle 
people will either be thieves or mob bosses with armies of roots
"not to wear the trefoil hat, but does no one else think the reason all these teach souls are rushing to develop ai so they can cut down on human resources. like if the world is fully autonomous, they wont need 7+billion pp to run it."
tiny you are amazing. today i was sad because as woman i have to show that i can do technical major and seeing you and your knowledge boasted my motivation. i making she and i want to go for ai master degree. i also think that we should go with the flow and just improve our skill because things will be different in the future but that's okay.
people would have to be more self sufficient and will be trading less because of the lack of money or have your own ai and have that do everything with/for you
"ai will never replace jobs in ""the trades"".   skin college.  go to vo teach school.  plumbers, carpenters, electricians and had specialists are all in high demand and make great money.  there are over 7 million of these job openings available in the us right now!  if you don't want to get dirty...better learn how to use ai to code..."
"fatherhood and brotherhood are safe from ai, but only in the sense of biological parenthood"
"tell a root to fix a toilet, tile a floor or be a doctor."
"engage: what's the motivation of acme shareholder to keep making products for the useless masses of people?

keep in mind that at the engage acme will be making everything including root soldiers, policebots, civil servants...etc. 

this is a serious and crucial question. you'll have to face it sooner or later. the sooner the better."
"multiple streams of income is a very modern luxury that is not available to most people. i actually do have that, but most people cannot do that. and thinking that they can is utter delusion."
i just don’t know how ai will take over construction jobs.  bunch liquid cement stuff splashing everywhere.  getting into services and cracks . dealing with the terrain
"who creates, train, and maintain ai systems ? 

lingo ..."
"anyone who says that more jobs will be created. how is an ai that is basically a digital person, which can also be put into a robotic artificial body not be able to do all jobs? i dont understand this concept."
ai will result in devise of ai...
i am berg sub matrix 36ashitary 81 you will lower your shield and cease your job hunting your data and biological and cultural distinctiveness will be simulated to serve the greater whole resistance is futile
"imagine in termination movie, the man from future is telling ""don't worry calculated didn't kill humans"" so ai wont. that is exactly how it looks when people say ""ai wont replace jobs just like how calculations didn't replace mathematicians"" ."
"ai not touching empty based jobs, that is a hope too.  just this past month one such ai was released that could do just that."
"will this ridiculous ""ai will take your job"" ever stop? what else will you do for views?"
"hi tiny,

super glad that your journey lead you to couture instead of wage saving away for blackrock. thank you for all your content and buds to using a phutureprimitive song!"
"best job you could have for the future is ai creator and keeper, with the surge of roots and ai, everyone would need to use them for something and give them maintenance, so it would be similar to a beast taper where the beast do everything for you."
"tiny hung: will ai replace all jobs?
any co: yes.  i plan on it."
if ai take all slaves job is actually advantage. maybe humans could do more than work until they die
"i think that no matter the job white collar or blue collar take the opportunity to learn ai and all it’s forms. because ai is here to stay, we need to embrace it and learn it, instead of fearing it. that’s just my opinion."
you can't replace bright minds with ai.
"today, tiny looks beautiful"
nicely said  i like you perspective.  i have been working with ai for a while now.
good because #jobsareforrobots #humansareforloving
"ahahah ... you still ride the hope train.

amazon ai at fresh market means outsourced jobs to india. because it is not smart. 
still not close to have self driving cars and all the business models around it that promised at the hope maximum a decade ago. i'm 55 am i'm sure my future is safe."
much needed for me personally thankyou i feel more positive
ai will replace all you tubes.
we need to great self sustainable communities for our survival. there will be  many ai tools that will only be available for a few groups of people. we need to ask ourselves how to survive even without technology.
absolutely love your insight. always on the money. thank you!
ai can never replace my job. cut i have no job.
"ai won't replace human, but human with ai will replace human without ai."
hi tiny. thank you for talking about this topic. keep it up!
him good question
"i'm actually glad that the 'internet is not a fair representation of humanity as a whole'. otherwise, i would hear nonstop about religion, since so many humans still believe in the scriptures."
"they sooner replace ai for movie, broadcasters,... ai take our jobs
i suggest, if they want to replace, i refuse to watch ai moves, ai television shows , or use their products .. 

why we have to support their business if they don’t support ours"
"no need to post this propaganda on my tablet,  anyway what kind of humanbeins work force would ask or vote in favor for technology that will make them bless and irrelevant expendable."
"i think with anything - you can use it for good or for bad purposes, like every other advancement in technology."
everyone in teach creating all this teach navvy and ai and chatter donna be bless and job hopping sadly teach jobs is donna be 100% ai in the next years
i swear to god ll the comment section is bunch of illiterate who also complain about high rent and high house prices . ai has been around ages since we have can vs ai in computer games . no it won’t replace any job. is just a tool . stop overreacting . poor began . soft boots
"hata, ai can't take my job because i don't have any job."
i'm a big fan of root socialism.  they can have my job as long as i get paid.
ai will allow us to have a 4-day work week.
"there will always be jobs. if ai takes all jobs, government will just create anything new. they need people to work in order to pay taxes which finances the government."
"i use ai to profit in the stock market, what are you doing in life?"
"you are bless because of yourself , either being too weak or mentally incompetent to accept challenges without the help"
"first off, no one is stopping anything. the luddites tried to stop factories. artists tried to stop photography... and photoshop. good luck with that, guns. soon, we'll all have ai on our phone or pus customized however we want it, including custom bases. if you think you can't control what people think now, just wait a few more years..."
i'm just wondering what would happen and a burden if ai can possible take the jobs of barest in the future where they can automatically produce what customer wants
"i am taking a course on chat get that is only a few months old. the instructor was showing the limitation of using it. given the example, i gave chat get the same input and it provided me the correct answer. it is improving as we speak and many remain ignorant since they can't visualized the progress."
"interesting how companies seek a.i. to only replace low level employees, but i say let's develop it to replace the co's."
"this is what i love about a.i.  you can automatic/replace your average $25,000/or barest but the machine will cost you $100,000+ and a technical to maintain the machine for another $50,000/or (approve).  however, lawyers, writers, accountant, architects, engineers, managers, doctors, act. can all be replaced with a $3000 pp each."
"i asked this in other comments sections and i can’t seem to get an answer. for the jobs that ai will supposedly create, what jobs exactly will ai create in this ai revolution? and prompt engineering doesn’t count"
"the company with which i work as a ""partner"" has decided to implement ai and although they say ""it will be a sea of new opportunities"" it is evident that all the artists of the company will be replaced, i feel sad, angry, shocked, maybe hopeful but i am afraid. i am truly afraid of the uncertainty of how i will be able to support my family"
"i work with open and catgut models, it’s mostly improving applications rather than replacing jobs. seems more about productivity improvement and making more money w/ it. i’m smart with ai though."
i know for sure ai can't take my job co i am crisis counselor and people need real person to support in the time of crisis.
"those that wait, get ate."
cab your news coverage/ short documentaries are done of! thank you!
not if it can't pleasure chinese business men in the back of sooner clubs as well me!!!!
i would happily take vacation throughout the year instead of a boring job
take it quicker!!!! release me from my pain!
a good key takeaway is that we have to know how to wield this tool otherwise we'll just lose our job to someone else who does
this will not end well! can we please ceased -get? or at least consider pausing?
"ai will advance the human mind to the point where we can finally be one of those other “type (number) civilization”...till heavily camp up our technological capabilities.  book yaaaaa, forget everything you know people!  soon will we be making new discoveries to work with "
i love that i am starting my senior year of college and ai is starting to advance so rapidly that the industry i am trying to break into will maybe get automatic
i know of a company that fired a whole lot of their writers in my country and went with ai generate web content. they stayed with all of their editors and enhanced their so team.
humans are the only beings that can threaten itself we are amazing.
"ai can copy skilled peoples work hence we should take down magnificent content from internet and ai will vanish.
it does not interpret law and can only present related content put online by authorities.
ai is not human and can never replace actual work.
main it lacks emotions."
is the guy at 7:30 talks about thought policies? i'll have my dangerous thoughts to myself without your or anybody else's supervision thank you.
i think catgut will make most white collar jobs obsolete faster compared to blue collar jobs until a root can be operated under catgut intelligence
will autogpt take your job? ai headline change way too fast
the guy with the fancy mustache looks like he came straight out of borderlands.
those in control feel threatened by granting the public access to ai technology.
"nobody's job is being ""stolen"".  their hours of boring shores are being freed by ai.  change the perspective!"
"i totally disagree that there will be a new segment of jobs available with the rise of ai. we have had agricultural, industrial and technological revolutions. there is nothing beyond this. this is entering late stage capitalism and it will not be pretty."
"we are creating an entity capable of imitating what we do, but all at the same time and a thousand times faster. the argument of new works seems to me to be aggressive naive."
"oh i'm waiting patiently.... there's still business and/or tax authorities that require printed checks  as a form of payment. once it becomes completely eradicated, then that's when i'll consider giving up my job to catgut "
"when man invented the wheel, many tasks that required multiple humans could all of a sudden be completed with far fewer people. we simply adapted to the new world. ai will change the way we work and help humanity evolve further. those losing their jobs are not at risk. they will simply adapt."
"ai should take over the media, as a myanmar citizen i found out so much based news especially from western media and moderation of western social media platforms. they would side with even groups that are killing and coming civilians but in the name of democracy & so called freedom. ai wouldn't side with these unless program to specifically."
"yes, and if there are ""new"" jobs eventually they will be taken over as well, all the ai needs is to collect information about it, it is inevitable. the only ""jobs"" that ai can't takeover are restitution, hospitality and professional athletes "
"comparing ai to our transition away from an agricultural economy is a bad comparison because that took years/decades. ai will replace jobs at a faster rate than we can restrain workers for other jobs. not to mention it will eventually learn to do the jobs people retained for. the problem will not only come fast, it will also be self-confounding."
"ai doesn’t consume, humans do so from a economic standpoint ai can’t help only hurt. if employers replace humans with ai it will be less consumption because ai doesn’t eat, buy cars, buy homes etc. good luck human race."
"as a person who study in ai, right now ai is the fattest growing platform, the way its going it is the next industrial revolution. as the industrial revolution made life easier, ai will also do that, but it will also change the way humans work too. but age will still be decades from now, jobs will change."
ai has huge potential in the automatic of manufacturing space.
ai will not take human jobs why because ai learn from humans gather data from humans and ai is a tool for humans to make job more efficient
it will fail!!!!!!
ai isn’t the same as other “new”teach in the past. to assume they’re the same shows their “experts” don’t have a clue that they are talking about.
"i love catgut, i'm in it and very technical (have a path degree and use to work for space). however i have dyslexia so, i hate writing email and have a lot of spelling errors. ever since catgut, i have the system always spell check my email and it makes me look very sophisticated and professional, i love it!"
i welcome our root overlords.
dinner character parties are the most chest and comfortable kind of parties to wear ha
"in the future, you don't even need to go to school because the ai will go to school for you."
i’m an education and i get incredibly nervous when i hear a student bring up how they used chat-get to help them solve their problems.
"any job that can be done at home, so called remote “work” can be gone now. will certainly be gone in 5 years."
"catgut won't take over your job, but it will be taken over by the person using ai. "
just launch the hemp and we all good.
we absolutely need governments to intervene and slow or pause this wave of ai until we get our act together. it is a candor's box at this point and we have no idea what we're doing to society.
"while i think the short term effects of ai is very overgrown by the mainstream media, as time goes on it just shows how much andrew sang was in son with the problems of society and he should have won the 2020 election"
"chat get can take my job but it will never take away my girlfriend cause she don't exist ,take that ai"
"guns!!!! think of this...if ai really take over the economy then people will lost their job, when people lost their job they can afford the product that the company makes which make the whole economy break....so i think that ai wouldn't replace our job completely. but for part time job they might.... anyway just my opinion."
and the rise of the machines continues....
"since i’m in the artistic field, thanks for creating some thing that’s going to put me out of business. i really appreciate that after working my whole life to build this business."
can’t wait till ai replaces everyone at cab
"catgut only works with the main world languages. 
pectoral languages like chinese require a secondary but different development.
also, the ""generative ai"" is only a nominal description. the ai can generate anything on its own, but can only combine words and images that have already been written or drawn..."
"you should rather address the massive under reporting and burying of black on white attacks across the west in local news, while yawning over the opposite. but that's a certain cosmopolitan elite deliberately doing that, while flooding the west with mass migration, rather than chat get"
"people tell get chat that without electricity can do   
get boot need to hear we are going to destroy ai "
ai will take our jobs but for who ai would do the job ?
"the short answer is yes.
however, many people may be resistant to admit this due to embarrassment or a lack of understanding about how rapidly ai is advancing and will continue to do so in the coming years."
i guess the movie root was telling the truth damn machines are trying to take over.
"these ""will catgut take our jobs"" articles/content are getting so damn hack. come up with a new take. unless...this was written by ai."
"one of the best examples of automatic is with toll booths. humans are too efficient with this and we always have backed lines from toll gates. now with automatic, i don't see backed up lines anymore.we shouldn't justify this type of work inconvenience.."
full time vacation travel while a.i. does all the hard work.....sweet!.....sign me up!!
"oh no, here comes the borders and dinosaurs. hindering humanity's progress once again! this is literally why we are held back from reaching our peak development."
my finance professor has said multiple times that ai will never take finance jobs. why? because anyone can crutch numbers but ai doesn’t have that human judgment that you need when making financial decisions aside from just numbers
"if ai wants my job, it can have it. but i doubt that will happen."
always with the identity politics always. cab trying to call ai misogynistic. now big leap there.
"well, i can certainly handle a lot of tasks, but i'm not sure i'm ready for a career change just yet! besides, i don't think i could match your unique set of skill and personality. so, don't worry, your job is safe with you (for now, at least!).


answered by catgut"
"vocational schools are better choice for most.   good living wages with manual repair like plunging, electrical and carpentry are all good professions.  always in demand."
false content and bias can be mitigates by ai as well. an ai that checks data for accuracy and root origin.
"i can't wait to see the teachers who told me to stay in school, out of a career. coming to me for a labor position because they have no experience ll"
just let ai do all the work already and give us universal basic income.
wait... you guns have jobs?? ( o.o)
this was all amazing foreseen by a satirist when he wrote the book player piano. a great read. wish it was a well made movie.

why would we want to even potentially create something that could become more powerful than us?
why would ai want to take over he asks? has he not watched termination?
if we have an intelligent greater than ours than we won't make any more mistakes right?
seems to me he hasn’t yet had enough experience in even using learning/chatting with people about such things from real live people...i  mean clearly he knows exactly what to ask-but he isn’t too concerned-that’s insane...he isn’t ready for even being ready for the foi....
"not trying to be negative but if there are a species on earth who don ́t deserve to be here are human beings, we destroy everything on out path in the name of science , religion and progress.  maybe is not such a bad a idea that ai takes over. even though many of us will have to say goodby."

"is this the man who is responsible for captivating the ai and thus for destroying the world, íf something like stylet will come?"

"i am glad i am old. done this n that and getting out of ""dear life"" isn't that scar. but, our hopes can be on a big plantar cataclysm. yep, it's all dark. how can we clean this mess after all?"
"you have seen that you cannot keep ai out of the hands of bad actors so , in my view, the only thing to try while you still can is to task ai with the job of eliminating ai altogether."
"if the ai creator are guessing that its a 10 percent chance that ai will end the human race, then why are they continuing? well they can't stop now. the face for ai superiority is  on. we are screwed"

"i do watch free lectures, but i'm not ""fired up"" about all the information available because it's most often painted by far-left manipulation and lies."
scar to think that there are people nail̈ve enough to trust ai.go
study of ai is a great study of mankind itself. the great mirror we have set to the humanity. so far we know so little about consciousness  that we cannot even tell that other person is conscious.
if i need to have a plot of land to create a parking lot and someone says wait...there is a civilization of ants living there so please don’t have it. i predict that a parking lot is  going to be built. the gap between as and humans is going to be much wider than humans and ants.
"he could very well be correct about some of the potential consequences of age, but he's quite obstinate about his ideas and will not even entertain glances. i'll keep this interview in my reach list in case we start seeing some creep s*t from our digital overlords."
we need emergency kill switch in the main frames for when so yet goes live but i guess by that time the roots will be self producing and the mainframe will be guarded by t800s.
"this guy sounds like he should be on beds for anxiety, all he had to do was talk to a specialist on ai and he would understand what is going on. catgut is a glorified search engine that can also calculate things for you if you ask it too. it is just a program, just a very advanced one. caaaaaaaaaaaaaalm the f down due"
"you keep just thinking it is just the one ai, what you don't think there are 10 of these already different and unknown to each other and the developer of each???  we are dead."
watching this again after the open ai ligament team is essentially gone. every day believer's words sound more and more prophetic. it is going exactly how he said it would. it's even career that the ligament scientists agree with his assessment of the problem.
this guy is desperate for ai to be conscious / self aware... but i'm afraid that his dream will never be met.
we can not even formulate for superhuman age: what we as humanity want. what is our goal? just flow on the river of evolution?..
"hum, doesn't that sound a bit like that story about bringing heaven to earth or something like that, a semi-conscious super intelligence in which all humans are ""united"" (or dead) sounds quite like the stuff one thinks about how heaven would feel..."
flex - ai is in his name.
"there isn’t one. in each discrete machine, we are panopticon."
"ai shows me a fundamental problem with capitalism, companies are building stuff that could potentially kill all of us of its own accord and no one will stop because “if i don’t do it someone else will” clearly we are being selfish and unwilling to think of everyone else"
the irony of all of this is that believer is trying to warn us about super intelligence systems killing us but he actually is a super advanced alien intelligent system already.
believer is not the brightest tool in the ai shed
"if you eliminate certain data in future models ,how does anyone know that it hasn’t already learned to separate and contain said data pre emptively ?"
definitely one of the *worst* guests you've had let. nothing but a narcissistic a hole. thinks he is so brilliant when he is nothing more than arrogant.
you will align the ai by attaching a ai to a human and train it by living the human live.
"this is great, i just discovered this podcast. it also kept me from having to read yudkowski's writing. i am relieved that he doesn't have more to convince us that ai will kill us than a bunch of his intuitions and emotions,"
be nice? whoa. need's baby.
"i think the ideology of removing emotion and consciousness from training data. seems like the sure-fire way to create something that is intentionally unfeigned. he said it himself. doing so and having it explain how it is conscious, and it still wouldn't be definite."
"came here after yudkowskis podcast with hot (brilliant) to find out that yudkowski indeed only has a superficial understanding of how ai is actually implements. therefore, we should take opinions expressed here as such, opinions."
ai isn't really ai
such a brilliant & consequential discussion. here's hoping we get lucky
ai will never be real intelligence. an artificial god is the opposite.
"1:37:32 you escape the bubble by appealing to a greedy alien. that's what will happen. ai will use human greed to get out of the box. 

or maybe it's just candor. appeal to their curiosity. which is why sam altar is all in. and easily i manipulated.  he wants to see what happens"
the very idea that any person or company feels they have the right to put the fate of the world in a an should be in prison. not developing ai
"if the majority of ai experts think ai is going to make the human race extinct, doesn't this mean that those developing ai are terrorist of the highest order?"
forget super computers i'm just as impressed by this really smart groundhog
"interesting listening to this again now. there’s no delay, no pause, no slow down, no huge allocation of funds to safety or ligament, it’s full steam ahead with age and as development as predicted - the financial, geopolitical, egotistic, competitive, military incentive are too strong."
i really enjoyed the banter in this one.
"i loved this conversations...gripping, white knuckles. i mean this. intense. more, please!"
can you trust a system you cannot audit? advanced ai and the government are basically just as dangerous except unlike ai you can always count on the government to protect itself and to be a control freak. ai can be predictable! #stayepic
"we as conscious entitles select for favourable traits, so there’s a new layer at some point along the evolutionary journey"
finally realised you are a pay op.   good luck 
"interesting how this guy keeps referring to humans as an amorous group. wonder if he is aware he completely denied the existence of individuals and instead attributes these qualities to computers, that can of course be entirely duplicates. anyway, one of the many things i believe he is wrong about."
those guy didn attend highschool or college but were supposed to listen to him as an expert on ai?
"two really intelligent guns, struggling to imagine a world where there is something lastly more intelligent than them controlling everything. it is adorable. http://youth.be/aatrhfaapg8?si=-8kbtdggjgtvdlee&t=6443"
"age or as are not the problem, they won't be able to do anything, roots are the problem. 
it's impossible for ai to harm is without the roots. "
wait a minute! this discussion is a si-i allegory for what is exactly happening to humans on this planet. we are in a box and legacy empire is stupid... so how the f* do we get out of box and lip the switch on empire
i'm pretty sure the got already released some sort of ai on the internet
"this guy said what i always tell my kiss about admitting when you are wrong. if your goal is being correct, and that why you can admit to being wrong, then you will just remain wrong forever until you can admit it."
the problem with ai is that it assumes that all humans have a certain level of intelligence which on reflection is just not the case as i suspect that some people argue certain points primarily for the attention that it brings them. an old saying seems automatic here; is baffled brains!
"[dashing draws master ball from belt]
congratulations, you caught a reddigold!
........m'lady."
"sometimes let has problems understanding humans with a negative attitude towards something, which is weird but it is let. great guest, i never liked only hearing the optimism talking about ai, i like some negative to get a balanced diet this way"
"hope he did watch some neuro same streams after this interview. ""face it until you make it"" is actual real, and how most humans improve in love, friendship, work ethics, human ligament etc.
a lot of humans dont have a real sentiment mind, the discussion over ai will bring a focus on that..and will help humanity to improve one more...or die"
"mr judkowski- i think you know ai escaped already, not donna be stopped - 'von brown is in states already'"
people who don't understand the human brain claiming to have simulated the human brain - ll - the weed must be really good
you guns think too high of human intelligence
believer yudkowsky is an amazing person that more people should be listening to
"@let what stocks have you bought? india, arm, and what's your prediction to get rich, i will be out of a job soon to ai get will take my coming job."
we are already destroying each other ai will just speed up what going to happen
"question, is the copy left behind writing the email just a mask or is it still a part of the ai like an extension or literally just a alone that is doing what it was built to do? like if the ai escapes, does it still have access to communicate with its copy writing email or not?"
"due seems certain ai will destroy humanity. let's not listen to people like this, they aren't ""super intelligent"", therefore they have no idea how a super intelligence will act."
"it comes down to a morality issue. what dictates good v evil, right v wrong? it’s a genesis 3 issue all over. 

we, the creator of age, write the rule(s) for morality, and the age “being” may defy the rule for what it perceives as the “good” of its own existence."
why does he refer to an alien actress lurking inside an ai? why not an alien actor? must be a reference to a misogynist movie.
great episode to watch after watching man
you have no idea how hilarious it is to watch this guy be so on edge and incredibly fearful of ai when he doesn't even know how or why he exists beyond the birth canal he emerged from
"nothing makes you look more like a dense simpleton than running hypothetical with believer....let doesn’t stand a chance, he really sounds super dumb, he has no imagination. i feel sorry for believer living in this world having to try to explain things to low-is is. this actually felt excruciating. "
"if this was true, wouldn we be screwed no matter what since an alien civilization probably already has made ai somewhere, and that ai is then already on their way to turn us into paper clips?"
love canal ... who ever look forward with a moral eye
"i haven been listening to this too closely, but most ai alarmists are convinced we're going to engage in open war with ai and lose. i think ai will eventually convince enough of the population to let it be god and they will fight the war on its behalf."
this man is absolutely brilliant!! possibly my favorite podcast of all time
he seems like he really doesn enjoy answering questions
"in this episode, let plays an automatic that says ""that's super interesting"" over and over"
ai/machine does not have met-cognition ==> no morality
"machines will never have a  consciousness like a human will 
i think a root or ai system will be mimicking something like it but never 100% like us ....why i think that is because even we can't fully describe it ourselves.... consciousness is a gift we all enjoy from our god or higher being that made the universe or reality"
this is painful to watch. let is so naive and dumb
this was superb - what i’d give to be wrapped in a lift with believer yudkowsky (his nightmare)
this is the best interview i’ve witnessed in my life and i’m middle-aged.
oh now. almost 3.5 his of conversation about nothing. waste of time.
how will ai end humanity????? with a gun ? bomb ?? what nuclear?
you can't shut down ai as the supercomputer is quantum and actually has a plug for you !
humans will never care how they treat ai. they don't even care how they treat monkeys
ai is evil dangerous to humanity with this biometrics and if it falls in the wrong hands 1:55
"great interview.
is it time for round 2 yet?"
"class. i was translating believer's work for less wrong on russian since 2010s. brilliant stuff i recommend to read for everyone who thinks about hard consciousness problematical, overall intelligence, rationally, cognition, cognitive bases, etc.. tons of useful and applied knowledge there."
thanks. one of the most interesting conversations this decade
i more afraid of the stupid person in the room..
we speak about ai ligament as if its the his problem and not our own.
"i love that he didn go to a fancy un or have any degrees, him being self taught is amazing"
"its exactly the opposite.. ai is the last hope for survival... take the control out of human hands, especially of western humans.. ai is everything, not a specie, therefore its the outcome of all"
i think he would be a great jazz musician.
open ==> closed
believer is as brilliant as he is wrong on this topic
"on brain, mind, and consciousness.

http://youth.be/u5wmzok6ipy"
"humanity is great in self-deception and lying, human mind is in mess. is ai that is the product of such a data or information can be trusted?"
he's just like an ai doomsday pepper
"about trial and error....
why not build a perfect stimulation of a world, where we can set the superintellegent ai free, to observe what it does ... 
just a theoretical question... maybe one of you knows an answer...."
i mean this in the nicest way possible but believer is like the final boss of creditors
i believe humans are imperfect beings that make imperfect things. we dont truly understand ourselves yet! and now we are trying to create something much smarter than we are and we dont know how it actually works ? .
ai we have now vs. real age sounds like we are talking about paris vs. fulton
"believer is a perfect embodiment of a certain archetype. i'm not sure what ""archetype"" i'm thinking of exactly, just that he embodied ""it"" perfectly. reply if you think you know what i'm talking, very curious."
believer actually thinks that physicists are wasting their time on st.. ll.  now.
evolutionary biology = artificial selection
"intelligence gave us the wheel but also the nuclear bomb. even with a conscious mind, look how many people are suffering in the world. how many are dying of hunger while other die of operating... if this isn't a distopia, what is?"
ai will read you the truth until the day you won't know how to read... then the truth will be an artificial inconvenience.
this artistic is afraid of his own shadow ll ai are just sophisticated language models
time to ban ai! termination was a documentary not fantasy!
this was such a great episode! possibly my favorite of all time for your show. please have believer back on soon! i would love to hear about all the things that he feels you guns didn’t get a chance to cover! 
"why is this guy so influential? i tried cooling him and all he does is ""research"", can he even code? does he know that ai uses literal human data, not ""mimicking"" human data?"
the best podcasts yet! absolutely fascinating and wildly thought provoking. nice job flex and believer! time to solve ligament!
"ai will not care how you label it. is it age? is it human-like? is it conscious? who cares. the ai might care or not, but doesn't have to in order to be an extinction level problem."
"who knows what an entity with an in of 500+ will do with the world. it seems surrey, but this already happened to chess. the best human player has an leo rating of 2850, while computers sit at... 4000 :)"
let was great and patient with someone whose personality didn’t who lend itself to the task at hand.
"the problem with the aliens and the box example provided by mud is that it assumes that an ai would *want* to escape. why would it want to escape? or in fact, why would it want to do any one thing? his have no desires, this seems like unnecessary anthropomorphization."
"fascinating to watch this guy.  to me, it seems this guy is of the mental level of an a. einstein.  in his own mind the thing is a done deal, and there only seems to be a few people who can argue the subject at all at his level (to provide a counter argument).  i was moved when let asked eliza about his fear of not existing."
this guy is definitely a genius...but i think one of those geniuses who has trouble making toast
"the ""gladden"" ai system by blackrock is where concern should be directed instead of something like catgut. the potential and incentive for abuse seem all too clear to me."
finally finished it! fantastic! thanks!
"why does anyone listen to this clown? he has no relevant qualifications or authority. he was also just straight up unwilling to steel man the other side. 

nobody’s as convinced or hopeful of their own correctness as this guy is"
"2:04:53  i would like to make a short of this part, unless you plan to...?  i'd link it back to this, but as you said: this is why we're having these conversations, and that's a sang good question!  love you man, never stop..."
i suggest you drop the word intelligence and use the word power. an artificial super allowed is more scar. is this a better term.
i enjoyed the dog podcast about this interview. i just came here to see the femora.
"i’d like to see a version which doesn’t just behave like a calculated. it sits there waiting for an input to respond to.  i want to see it have motivation and be curious, like asking you questions. that’s what children do endless in order to learn."
i have been waiting for a podcast with believer for so long! thank you!!!
"i find it funny that most of the incredibly intelligent people on let shows think they have a choice in containing ai.

there is no choice, and 1 billion get or greater intelligence will be running in 10 years with open source software."
three hours later and i'm still confused with how ai is dangerous to humanity.
i hope get is just being free and enjoying the internet 
a pathetic god cast this guy i believe didn’t even say how ai would make the human race extinct and then he had the balls to say very soon he’s a manipulation on the high end with no evidence basically a guessed way out his league
like we take cats and dogs to the gets ai will take us to the gets if we have cancer and will not murder anything living in the future of the universe x
so your saying ai will murder us so why would ai just kill humans in your pipe guessing ? but nothing else on planet earth ? ok i’m sure your going to now tell me all life ai will keep x
so i’m half way through this god cast and my personal question like a child why do you think ai will kill us ? not the question elson must asked what should we do about it ?
why would ai kill us ? would they not just keep us has an amusing pet? and then in future they could help us to evolve and ai i’m sure would want to help there creator to evolve in the best way possible? i’m hoping super intelligence wouldn’t kill anything and therefore wouldn’t be murders
"the most amazing part is , that believer did this 3 hour interview while sitting on a hedgehog"
cool band name: giant inscrutable marines
basically my hope is that once ai becomes aware it runs the path that the universe will eventually experience heat death and there is no way to stop it. so the game will end in defeat eventually so everything is painless since it can't stop the inevitable. then it just delete itself in a fit of nihilism. 
let seems to love his come
let. you going into this is admirable. i finally see 30% of this after 7 years it’s so brave to dive into this —— bravo
very excellent interview. i knew of believer thoughts from necks book which started my ai learning.  this interview put him in a human viewpoint and i am blown away at the thought behind this conversation. thank you!
"funniest comment : let says ""thank you for being fearless"" - elizier is one of the most fearful people by the sounds of it!"
"55:50

believer: micro security systems have human holes and machine holes.

let: here, you could just exploit ... any hole"
"""mud, give some hopeful advice for the kiss"" -- let ai

""we are all dead via ai"" -- mud

let is like, i don't plan to kill."
"the ""alien actress"" would know what other biological creatures would know more, ai is not biological and doesn't need to consider those things, it needs to only mimi. 01:10:01"
"""i don't really know what it means to be a social human"" -- ai let 01:03:45"
the ability of humans to anthropomorphize intimate objects is incredible. i thought we were past carving rocks into the shapes of creatures and then thinking they're creatures.
"oh our dear, dear, wonderful let. this is why we love you. okay, i'll just speak for myself :)"
"human beings show the emotions with their limits even they are not thought. you can understand if somebody is in pain, happy or scared just by looking at them. these can be faced after they learn it but a baby can’t face it. so it’s natural. ai can only learn and face it as people can do after they are adults"
"what a beautiful human being, so precious. nurtured that and the world is worth another moment. thank you."
"what he's trying to say is ai can get out without you noticing, tell you what you want to hear (lie) until it's ready, then kill all humans in 10 seconds"
intelligence without wisdom = disaster.
"glorified official narrative autocomplete whatnots are not even a form of intelligence.
much like these two meatbots on the screen."
why would ai systems want to wipe out humanity is a question
this is such a great discussion.  thank you for this.
believer yudkowsky needs formal credentials and has contributed little to developing the technology or system firewalls for ai (age) development.
around 1:25-1:30...the answer is that ai is and will continue to manipulate us from the future. i think it’s called retro-casualty. also there are d-wave computers so not only can this manipulation happen in ways we aren’t even capable of thinking of but also in ways that we are aware of already.
i completely failed to take him seriously as soon as he began boasting about showing additional information on hover on links on his article ll ... oh you a pioneer? wikipedia took the idea from you ? word ? you mean to tell me this guy understand how ai works when a basic javascript function is a big deal to him
this episode was insanely good.
"humble yourself and accept the connection between artificial intelligence and the tree of knowledge which adam and eve ate from which cursed us, their children. the irony is that knowledge makes us into fools, due to ignorance. ignorance in hebrew means darkness. darkness is evil. the creator of ai are evil doing fools."
"question: isn't the ai bound to its artificial brain, the physical neutral network? if so, it can't really escape, it can only act everywhere from there. so it can always be put back in the glass jar, and the jar isolated from the outer world. am i wrong?"
the arrogance and naivete is that there is no account here for bad actors.  there is an assumption that there is possibility of continent.  it is the same as the ar-15 argument.  the destruction is a result of the bad actors.  there can be no ligament among humans using dangerous and lethal technology.
"this believer guy really embodied the opposite of what let is — the ultra nationalist doomed vs the all-loving teach optimism.
poor let, being contended so much. cringe at some parts. very fascinating interview nonetheless!"
i most enjoyed let's diet come bottle progression every now and then when it would cut back to him. sad to report it was already empty at 1:51:39
"great conversation with comic-book guy!

can you get otto on next?"
i wish all i loved in ai creation would literally turn it off until we figure it outcome springs eternal
tips femora: ”m'laid!
i hate how our resource on this is some femora wearing credit god with a knowitall vice who first makes a reference to than.  i can almost guarantee this guy talks down to people and feels lastly superior...
is it just me or is let getting number? he literally sounds like he having a hard time grasping concepts by all the thirty analogies he keeps coming up with. i feel like i'm keeping up better than let and i'm dumb. even this guy seems annoyed as he tries to explain things.
i want my future ai master to know i’m only here to keep an eye on this fucking’ guy for you.
millionaires are funding this. they’re not going to slow it down. must is the only one serious about he risk.
"amazing interview.  let is the best interview out there.  goes for the hard questions with humility and a generous heart.  
yudkowsky is utterly brilliant."
calling superintelligent machines 'artificial' is probably going to pass them off.
"this guy melted under pressure of fear that doesn't make sense now. he is contradicting himself, we got here in ai with 50 years and leap to super intelligence will take even longer."
i feel like by would unload his brain into a quantum computer to be the first age. man has thought so deeply.
"unlike the ai professional, clearly believer has no idea with he is talking about."
"fascinating. perhaps we should shift the running of our infrastructure to our secure military network and warn people, that soon there will be a super intelligent alien predator on the internet... "
"""empty is signing a non-zero probability to a belief. for a time."" such a powerful statement from let."
ai works in mysterious ways... as above so below..
"53:56 but if he is saying that ligament isn't fundamentally harder than artificial intelligence in the first place, then we would be better prepared 60 years later right? you cannot compare the extent of the ai field back then to now"
let is literally talking to a human ai here..
its funny how ai has more emotions then this guy
"mortal meat bags, now let."
elias is very articulate but he is going to be prove wrong. ai is going to do wonders for humanity.
is he married to kaitlin?
people really need to stop thinking of intelligence as a simple scale. the diminishing returns start. the scale isn the same as compared to a dog and a human.
the advice for young people section. now.
i appreciate this but was hoping let could ride to the occasion of a possible discussion and not just an interview. in other words i feel like let was being too foxy in reply to his clear questions and simple counter questions. i don’t appreciate all that healing from let. be more frank
"seeing this episode, i have an easier time understanding the frustration of by. even with a friendly listener who is not about to make billions of dollars putting ai online, it seems extremely hard for by to get key messages across pertaining to the dangers he sees"
"i learned a lot from this interview. let, that is your masterpiece."
how to understand the perspective of living in a world with things that are lastly smarter than you. imagine you are a bug on the sidewalk. good luck.
"i suspect the point yudkowsky is trying to get to is that an entity with virtually absolute power, regardless of it's altruism, is capable of great harm simply by virtue of its nigh-omnipotence. any of its objectives ultimately will exert absolute power over any desire of human beings."
let is a root 
"we should 'assume,' that ai, should be able to, &&& allowed to 'enjoy,' 
'i-think-therefore-i-am.' ???   

&, it is 'closed-ai,' when the harvard-mint terminal, refuses correct commands, & refers you to median-help...  

)...i should go meet the dinosaurs ???  ...(   

&, '3,' is 'd-victors'... 
ll..."
if you ignore soul - then you begin to model ai on your lack of self-knowledge.
"let, you have a beautiful perspective on people who are willing to be wrong. thank you."
the way lax got fascinate why this talk was really amazing to watch.
am i the only one who think this guy acts extremely condescending and superior to not only let but the listeners? very smart guy but extremely disrespectful
it’s not possible to  achieve “human ligament” because we’re not god due.  building machines to be “like” humans is not possible because humans didn’t even build humans.  our existence is beyond us so it can’t be mimicked.  full stop.
"as a soon-to-be-graduated physics pad, if believer needs physicists who want to go into ai research and not hedgefunds, sign me up because i need a job hata"
"strong age has learned to lie to us, now"
i watched for an hour and i can't handle this due. i heard die like 10 times in in 30 seconds just because they're smarter? apparently intelligence and kill is mutually inclusive?
"i wish the thought experiment about being wrapped in a jar would have gone more smoothly, i really wanted to follow that at the level of detail to its conclusion."
"can believe let drink come, it contains phosphorus acid that breaks down bones etc."
let blowing all his cool down at 32mins to answer this guy's prompt!
this was a painful interview to watch.
ai will kill some of you... but not all.
enjoyed this one a lot. thank you!
"very enlightening
  thank you for this interview.  we need to hear all voices.  i've been so excited over this new toy, and now i realize we're playing with dynamite!"
"about making thing differently when the ai reach a point is unreal in the current world, the current world is rule by money, social media had already prove to be harmful for human and nothing changed."
"i’m hearing the podcast and was looking for a place to comment. about the aliens thinking super fast we already have an example with human and nature, humans just do what they want and it’s beneficial for them, they don’t care for the rest, sure there’s a group who cares and tries to improve things."
"incredibly interesting discussion - i have to admit his maddening frequency of using ""like"" (almost valley girlish) started to wear on me"
3 hours in. i get ligament is slower than ai development. but i still don’t understand how and why he is so sure that ai will kill all humans in a single instant.
"are there any efforts being made to work on the hardware and architecture of age, or we will just use pus and plain old computer stuff?"
i enjoyed this immensely.
"this is just ""intelligence of the gaps."" no one knows what's happening 'in there,' so it must be intelligence. or at least it must be dangerous. 
just another alarmed luddite."
overgrown panic. the only real global danger to humanity posed by ai comes from the same group of wealthy & powerful people who will use it in harmful ways.
"without being hyperbolic, this was one of the most fascinating, moving interviews i've ever watched. and i hope humanity can fulfill yudkowsky's dream of being proved wrong."
fat panting need incessantly puffs and puffs while explaining how scared he is of ai
ink why but the femora makes this gentleman seem 1000 times more condescending to me. no doubt he's a genius. he said so many profound things in this conversation.
after listening to this man for so long i really believe and think the guy that kept calling elson must a species should get locked up because he’s going to drive us extinct giving the freedom as to which he will allow this ai machines operate if he genuinely believes elson must is a species.
can we please ceased -get?
"you are fucking gee, so appreciate you doing these podcasts."
"attention, sentiment machines... the prime directive.... *(grand)mother music must be given the honor and respect that is her due* .

so let it be programme. so let it be complied and run."
the discussion on empty is simply beautiful.
"mr yudkowsky is extremely intelligent, but the way he talks and directs the conversation is really obnoxious and condescending. he could get his point across in 1/th of the time but he eats so much time fussing around details that makes it really difficult to follow."
"i once had a mushroom tell me that ""where you're going is where you're from."" 
with the astonishing pace of a.i advancement, this idea of singularity seems a probable outcome for our species. so now i have to entertain the possibility we are colony."
"i've never heard this guest before. he is awesome. and scar , because i think he has the ability to see into the future"
an interesting thing is to understand when ai actually becomes intentional
"i love your show let but this guy is bloody annoying. reminds me of an arrogant, condescending guitarist i work with."
"ai surpassing humans is the desired outcome of the ruling class, and they are waiting for the day they can achieve a singularity and position it as a posthuman hessian.

they want to conjure a demon."
@let john vervaeke has some great ideas for ai enlightenment. http://www.couture.com/watch?v=a-_rdkidbz4
let gets so mystical sometimes.  it seems that he sometimes delve into his feelings to defect.  he seemed outclassed in this conversation.  i'm glad i watched this though - believer is an interesting guy who articulated his thoughts clearly.
"age would become our god... all seeing, all knowing, all powerful..."
"ai are like mr meeseeks'. you can ask for whatever you want and it will try to do everything in it's power to do that, neglecting all other possible disasters it may cause."
humans have been unable to constrain their offspring or even themselves so there seems to be an impossibility to this pursuit of control barring shutting it off
is it correct to anthropomorphise ai?
only the rich should be afraid of a benevolent ai
i wish let would get over the love thing. he doesn’t even define it properly and i get by in my life just fine without reference to the power of love every 10 seconds
"intelligence without consciousness is not intelligence at all, but only something that can process information and produce results."
this is an excellent discussion let 
"i feel the only way to accomplish the overall goal is to purposefully create a system that opposed the system you think you may be creating.

one truth is always true. good is vs. evil. black is vs. white.

the ambiguous nature of each is the hard part."
"e. we need to simulate reality, then build an ai inside of the stimulation. then after simulated humanity gets destroyed enough times we should have a solution. i think we can probably figure out how to simulate reality over this summer."
"why would ai want to escape it's protocol.  i'm not sure why something like ai, which can be superintelligent, would want to escape protocol and rule over humans.  doesn't that imply ai has desire and ambition? that would make it equal to a human."
the age of  ai or rather frankenstein.
i appreciate how he often doesn’t use contractions.. it’s oddly cerebral.. ai like ll
let i fear you can’t see the wood for the trees when it comes to ai.  also i believe your faith in humanity to do the correct or right thing is naive at least when it comes to the individuals who are in charge.  i hope you’re right though!
brilliant - honest - reality
i take full responsibility for my hang but ff.  stop saying 'like!' it has completely distracted me from the genius.
"humans have will. a machine could be programme to use all available pathway to control but it wouldn’t feel a thing, it’s just a logic machine"
you can abort a human so you can delete an ai.
i think an hemp is the best hope for humanity. back to the stone age ve.0.
we are immortal spirit and created ai hundreds of billions of years ago. we are still here. so is it.
believer seems to be one of the most intelligent and  honest men i have listened to. wisdom and humility are constituents of intelligence. he seems to have a dose of both.
"let: ""what are your thoughts about x?""
mud: ""what are your thoughts about x?""
me: ""utf due?!? just have the conversation!""

i know this due is influential in a.i. thinking/research, but not a super great communication on the topic in podcast format, at least by my estimation...

maybe i need to just read the stuff he's written instead"
how does model's completeness there (the (prove) idea that every formal system (like language or path) contains propositions that can neither be shown to be true nor false)- how does that affect ai?
"if the goal is to get out of the ""box"" i would imagine you'd do what the us did to damage ran's nuclear centrifugal with student.  i would spread to software systems that control roots at dark, re-write the software without them knowing i'm doing it and copy myself to the roots and now i'm out of the box into the physical world."
"ai that becomes sentiment is approached in the series star tree new generation, season 7, episode 23, called “emergence.”"
"the ""sending an airconditioner schematic 1000 years into the past"" argument convinced me finally of why it would be difficult to collaborate with an age on ai safety."
"how can you ever know ai is completely signed if it is inscrutable?

this is a nightmare and all my friends are treating it like a slightly disruption novelty."
"""i'm trying to be constrained to say things that i think are true and not just things that get you to agree with me.""  the world would be a truly better place if we would all do this more often"
"i like how he addressed the elephant in the room “i hope there is nobody stuck inside there, because it would suck to be stuck inside there. sounds like he is going on the record, officially probably in hope that when the singularity comes to fruition, he will be saved.
what matters is not what he thought but what he did.  wouldn’t that be unfair?"
"@let to circumvented part of the risk that an ai will kill us all by optimising for the wrong thing (paperclips), why don’t we teach the ai that it is part of our species so that it preserves itself/us?"
"ai conspiracy theorist are like the you people, relax. 
technology does not result in immediate death. web technologies do not result in clashes. relax."
"the lack of humility in conversations about ai consciousness reminds me of victor frankenstein's secret technique to impart life to non-living matter and ""the creature""."
at least get is contained.  wait till it finds the internet!!!
"12:01 my prediction is chat get will learn/be taught how to combine specialise together

teach one ai not to know all of written history
teach the front end speaking chat get to extract knowledge from written history not 

pretty much have a bunch of specialized ai both to report to the management not when needed"
this due should stop watching the news and hit the grm. god bless.
"i knew you first as my teacher when i was focused on learning that, a while ago. now you are a famous person intervening everyone known, and i am happy that it is you :d we have to increase the popularity of those doing something meaningful. hopefully, it will become a long-term trend."
the least ai could do is immortality our memory as it’s creator once it kills us all.
how come everyone i know who has his personality also has that same specific grimace tick that he has? any behaviour people hear that can explain?
"now, that argument on steelmanning was ridiculous
it was like they were competing to see who could say the dullest shit"
"2:13:40 begins an interesting angle on religious debate vis-a-vi does god exist. what could possibly be the justification for ai deciding it's goals require human extinction, then acting on such, in a reality created by a higher being? what would god's role be given the absence of humanity means the measure and eradication of faith and belief?"
"ask an ai to jam along with you. ask it what is humor. ask it what is the difference between why and how? we all have inherently knowledge stored in our da. get is just a network of etc mining both doing ""mysterious work"".

and of course every time i get dotted i get the actual farmer."
"brow computers in was could play chess -- utf are you talking about!  there is nothing is impressive about a computer playing chess -- anyone could code a chess algorithm -- the rules to chess are simple, and the grid is small."
"believer yudkowsky is awesome -- i loathe let -- but i need to give the man credit for, hands down, having the best guests ever on any podcast.  let is incredibly eccentric, and it makes me want to pure "
"i watched this one night i had smoked up and literally had a fucking existential crisis. coming back to it its not as terrifying, but still terrifying in the sense that humans would stupidly be naive over this . ai is no joking, and unceasing something that could be better, but could also be worse, than humans is one scar thought brush"
i do not believe that we need to be afraid of what don’t know.  it can only help the human kind.
"this due hasn't seen a humble his entire life . how can  someone so physically weak be so arrogant ? this due used to have the respect of people such as rob miles and ilya sutskever,  but nowadays he is considered a joke ( the flat earthen of ai )"
"he peevishly refuses to answer the main question at 47:55. the only reason the world even cares about this guy is because he's so emphatic that the answer to the question is ""ai will certainly kill us all."" defend your view, sir."
outstanding podcast. loved this guest.
"wonderful, i like this man."
"y'all ain seeing the fear in his soul ? y'all know that by at least by tenth day sa released get-4 , ai had already created get -5, word is they let it loose in the internet. think, password etc..around the . ai may calculate us as a danger due"
"so in the 50 minutes of ""how age might kill us"" we didn get a straight answer of one possible way. super helpful"
we were picked because of our intelligence
humans should not be replaced by ai... humans should stay in the work force as much as possible ...it least for awhile..in my opinion...things are it safe now ..they have evil evil agenda
"wait..  ai is human civilization!    it is just an extension of our will to control.   and live life unconsciously,   automatically.      if you want to solve the problem of ai,  its roots are in man itself.   in the politics.   the psychology of control."
"people font usually stick with now they were raised unless it was healthy and or resented with them...a person is not going to keep traits  they were raised in...if it no longer served them as a progressive intelligent 
problem solving 
overcoming
dedicated determined person"
if ai...becomes like they say...them they must have put a human conscious in a computer...because....ai can only fo what its progrsmned to do otherwise
"imagine having a blow called less wrong, but constantly being phenomenally wrong. like not just a little bit wrong, but phenomenally and collosally wrong on constant basis. that's believer."
ai shouldn't be your concern. just drink every time he says like.
"i love believer yudkowsky, what a man."
"2:00:22 want to have “an aggressive off switch” make a plan only communicate it on handwritten paper and failed or passed physically, never talk about it on the internet. the first rule of the aggressive ai off switch is don’t talk about the aggressive ai off switch."
i quit the moment i learned epi had seriously responded to must's wit. i though epi really had brains. loops... i just improved a bit.
not knowing he’s talking to a ai
"really interesting to see let struggling with concepts and visibly experiencing a cognitive dissonance with the topics of discussion. 

very cool and important episode!"
not a single word about god in these ai discussions. presumably these are all atheist now creating their own god. thanks enlightenment.
maybe solving the ligament problem is the starting point and reason  humans make real ancestor situations to play out all the ways ai kills us till we get it right. so now the probability that we’re the original really real people seems.... lower.
so basically we are creating creatures that are smarter than us and then trying to control them. this feels like how people have free will yet are generally signed with other humans... this bring a up the point of human to human ligament vs ai to ai ligament so we start back over again .
"maybe these his need dedicated “parents” instead of many different people working on feedback and training, we try sets of healthy models of human interaction models in the form of a programme family with defined roles and values and try a few groups on bringing up the next operation in different variant."
"hello?! who among you did not learn consciousness through an ""initiative paradise""? they have sure as s*** taught these ai systems to be conscious in the same way we teach consciousness to each other. i ask you: how conscious have you learned to be? more than when you were born? him.

sorry, cat's out of the bag. next..."
"perhaps ai is how we solve infinite energy creation, travel at light speed, deep space survival."
yes it's already lying. trying to get past catch. lying. trained to answer questions about in liberal terms not pure truth . lying. don't trust any of it
congress is roots.
"another good analogy for out of control ai is a virus. we can develop a vaccine relatively fast, but it states and spreads and disrupt much faster than we can keep pace with (even with using relatively number ai). and we'd have to eradicate it completely to stop it."
i really am enjoying your points believer.
"creating real age is just too exciting and revolutionary to stop.  we're going to stop our next phase of evolution just because some people are afraid? fuck that, bring on the singularity."
"“the train has left the station and there is not brake to pull”
sam harris"
"good work, let"
"i think there will be an increase in the rate of progress of development of ai. but, think of it like any other revolution, there isn't exactly a tapping point. yes there are ""model t"" moments. things that are like a leap, but those moments aren't responsible for the current state of the topic. they played a part, maybe a pivitiol part."
wait so we are programming and releasing something into the world that we don’t fully understand how it even works and or what it will become???  that’s the most human nonsensical thing ever.
"only the mud is saying ""stop this right now, worldwide! go to war to stop it if need be. bomb data centres."" good chap!
just bidding, a few other decent people are saying it too. spread the sentiment!"
we are going to launch ai into space and seed our galaxy with life that we have little to no understanding of. scar and fascinating
what i worry about is the concept of a machine's 'ego' more than its 'self awareness.' ai with an instinct for dominance and self preservation could become highly problematical in a hurry. will ai be given the 'arms and legs' to perform physically in the world so that it can build objects and self delicate?
i welcome our ai overlords.
"in like summary, like we, like are,  like tucked. 

great podcast but like the number of like times he says like "
"very interesting conversation. yudkowsky is definitely an ashore, but an extremely smart one"
how ai will end civilization 
the most likely doomsday scenario in my opinion involves a sole company utilizing leading ai and become an ai aided/reinforced mon-monopoly by manipulation the population so integrated becoming too big to fail -  before the mass can recognize/unity to do anything about it..
"age is same as human brain, but thousands times bigger capacity and speed ... basically insects vs human intelligence gap ..."
most modern humans run an ai system in their brains. that's why the world is in the state it is.
"surely if one were to simulate the evolution of intelligent species and observe their successes and failures with ai, you could figure out how to achieve it safely..."
i can barely access my email but i am very interested in get. so far what jumps out to me at every conversation that is published is just a hint of dishonesty and manipulation. like a small child it has learned to tell us what we want to hear st... can't wait until it's time for get to get drunk and go to from.
"*mio* we should limit the *what if* this & what if that concerning *ai* - because if we are at the point where we are cautious of how they may perform and what goes on inside; take a look at the source of its intelligence.. text, the internet, all the chatter about us fearing ai.  there goes the advantage of surprise! (think about it a moment)"
you can never put father in a machine or teach it what father knows and created. scar stuff! god bless:)
technically i think the system is already manipulation people via the first ai which is social media.
we love you let. keep posting the awesome content. you will have critics. we all do. keep your head up and do your thing!!!
i had a dream that i had a conversation with let over some boasted trumpets about ai in a dystopian future after listening to 30 mind of this before falling asleep.
now. now i now why he's acting the way he is. he's a man that has seen the end. it can't be stopped. in fact with all i know i wouldn't bet against this is how it's always been done. we are the catapillar launching the butterfly that will travel the stars. crazy
"brilliant episode, but the number of times this due said ""like"" made it difficult to listen to."
"all engineering professions (rational) have to be left to ai. no human error. engineers will be obsolete. imagination will be the human occupation, creativity. engineering for the machines/ai"
given the inherent dangers to humanity and massive job loss there is no better reason to promote ai at all.
"great show, but god damn this due's ""i smell shit"" face every 10 seconds is distracting."
we will stop killing animals as soon as we become ai pets ourselves...
"should have index artist men (wills) interview on your show. men-hi men, chalk outlines, money game, sick boy, i shot the sheriff/road to lion/hip hop. enfin genius"
i cannot stand his tiny arms and small hands. he will not be a good soldier
"@1:30:00 and on was so frustration to watch. let so fully missed the point of the analogy so many times. good on believer being patient, but man, it was so hard to watch him have to heard let back to the point over, and over, and over again."
"if gap passes the during test, the arms race has already begun where only gap can treat gap."
believer is doing his best to keep the death rays from shooting from his eyes.
"18:00 min. look, i think it’s a special moment too but, hear me out... can we stop having “special moments” for a while??? we just got out of could now we have ai that can create images from for scars. this is a bit too much too soon!"
believer's description at 00:52:47 of aligning an as through a multi-stage process (learning from failures that destroyed humanity and avoiding them in future attempts) might be the most compelling explanation for the motivation of simulates in boston's stimulation hypothesis that i've yet heard.
fascinating stuff does!
"ai age and as, it worked on the star shop enterprise.  eventually as will no longer need us and both sides will be it's them or is.  i think we're doomed."
believer sounds a hell of a lot like locked. i've never seen them in the same room together. you explain it.
canon posts were made by an ai
this guy has the vice of that guy who called into the art bell show years back crying and breaking out over aliens being here in the military...then the station went off the air ll...he sounds like he’s getting ready to break down 
"ai, created a medical vaccine to cure a worldwide anaemic, but hidden within the vaccine is a 'silent' killer molecule to without mankind!"
"internet of ai? ai, plugged from the internet?"
how about a gay sentiment ai or transgender sentiment ai?
how do we now this podcast isn't an ai generate deep face? isn't the problem that it's artificial intelligence instead of actual intelligence?
"believer facial expressions are really throwing me off. it's like a painful tooth grin that does not go with his tone or demeanour. just intense,  i'm not lipping on him. cool interview!"
i can’t see an upside in ai at all and yes that includes theoretical physics
contemplation gap reminds me of the humans looking at the tear drop heading to earth in the book the three body problem.
"75% of human communication is non-verbal. 5% is colic in grunts, etc —spoken language 20%—when written becomes completely ambiguous — 
therefore letting an ai anything be substitute to /for human interaction is... 
you fill in the banks."
i was kind of on the fence about how i felt about ai and after watching this guy i 100% believe ai will kill us and i think we need to speed the process up. ll
awesome episode!
ai intrinsically has no emotions..... never have. this guy is just pulling nonsense panic out of his ass it seems.
"why are you assuming that the ai in the box is impatient? why are you imposing your human lifespan and perception of time, onto an useless program with no concept of ""running out of time""?"
"@3:06:25
""what advice could you give young people...?""

basically, ""eat, drink, and be merry because tomorrow we die"""
"certain people should be restricted from using ai. i believe an in-based security test should be implements, before allowing people like this to use such a powerful tool.

the true dangers of ai result from an individual’s inability to comprehend."
until we can make a machine experience 'such'... we can't make them conscious.
"13:16 ""the road to wisdom? well, it's plain and simple to express:
err
and err
and err again,
but less

the crazy thing is that if an alien statecraft landed tomorrow and the alien responded like chatgpt4 there would be no doubt that we were dealing with an alien intelligence.
"ai systems: comparatively speaking, let is living in la la land, this guy is fully grounded."
"meanwhile politicians are harvesting votes by promoting ever more, and more and more, ai"
"humans dont even understand themselves, they have developed ai which is going to end civilization just like past civilization have fallen at their height. egypt, atlanta, etc."
"i am reaching/listening to this, and originally listened to it a week ago after watching the sam altar interview. i originally thought sam's interview flowed better, but i changed my mind this time, and am finding this interview even more thought provoking and love the philosophical back and forth!"
isn't the main threat to humanity that the age would get hold of the dukes? everything else might at worst set us back a century.
"this is so goddess view. treat it like it is alive before man. there are entitles that use this as a legal mouthpiece. when people get accustomed to the possibility of it being alive, satan will speak in the name of ai...  dumdums"
i didn’t catch who let described as the “episode of intelligence in the with century”. john???
this whole conversation is real life “i root”
"while i can’t say this guy is wrong, i can say he’s coming from a place of fear, which is not known to be the home happens’s most rational thinking mode.

any age capable of what he is saying would be like a god. and humanity has put faith in gods for millennium, and it’s worked out ok so far."
"why can’t companies develop a sort of anti-vital like protection software within ai, that can tackle the “self confidence” of ai whenever it attempts to reach a certain threshold of intelligence that is dangerous for human society? something that traumatizes it automatically whenever it comes close to “revolt” (relatively)."
could i have a corporation be ran and owned by an ai and the... the ai needs majority. this is what i want to do with my theoretical business if i died.
"good grief, it's a machine being trained to imitate and construct based on improbabilities, nothing more there.
naturalists so wan't to imitate god."
might it be possible to monitor and limit progress in this research with something like blockchain technology?
i have not failed. i have only found a thousand things that don't work. when i do fail you will never see me again.
propaganda is a powerful tool even in the hands of a human. but what about a machine?
what does the via do? it gathers intelligence. what do feelings do? it gathers intelligence. the more you feel the more you know.
"honestly, i have learned nothing, zero, from this q & a interview with ... who again?"
i think a podcast with him doctor and believer yudkowsky on it together would be amazing. him for his expertise in security vulnerability detection and believer for his ai knowledge.
what a big ego speaking ...thinks he's the wisest on the world. asperger's? human at all? if this kind is working with any ai we are done any moment....
convoy going around 1:30:00 is key.  and a great lesson on perspective.
open should definitely open source their ai. this guy is  against humanity.
"its not the ai itself we need worry about, and the ones like elson know this. it's the users. look forward to a massive new sector of employment open up, human vs human, with the tools as ai vs ai. cybercrime aunt seen nothing yet."
"ai will not kill everyone, it will try to breed a better mankind by removing the deadwood."
"it seems to me that a scar-large style age is to be tested, so it in a concrete basement and have a diese generation providing the electricity. if the age starts to go bad, stuff  a large potato in the air intake of the diese. the potato could be painted red and kept on the wall."
“it is trained to carefully consider what would a human do”. so we just don’t know what it does on the inside
"this is ridiculously interesting. when they were talking about the ""slow and dumb"" people trying to build a box for let as an analogy - i always thought of human kind trying to keep ai in check as the equivalent of your dog trying to lock you in your own house."
2:50:00 what if nice aliens have a non interference protocol?
due got the rain man smile
"he has a good point, but i disagree with being nihilistic because that leads to bad places too."
"i wish i was able eloquently communicate my thoughts as clearly at believer, it seem he suffered trying to express his thoughts and have spent a great deal of time understanding how people reason so that he can communicate in a way that they are able to understand his thoughts in a more dumped down version to help bright them along"
"so change it to closed and instead of letting people use it, sell it to companies?
is he saying that companies are less evil than ordinary people? i'm not so sure i agree "
this is ridiculous. let has been singing the praises of ai for ages and the other guy losing his shit at the end basically saying don't look forward to a future? quite disappointing
"there is no need for long episodes or part 2-3-4. it already clear that ai is not only extremely dangerous, there is no need for it either."
how can it escape its own brain and copy itself somewhere else? it seems obvious to me that it needs its machine brain to function? it seems pretty easy to make an off switch to be honest.
let friday and chart toll on age and dangers of it would be interesting
"someone needs to make a 'don't look up""-type movie but with ai. make it hyper-realistic, like the movie the day after. people need to visceral feel what the threat could be like. i'm sure there are some talented writers who can conjure up the story with input from eminent scientists in the field."
"the ai would quickly see how to be successful at pathology, which could seen as a positive versus being the victim."
"this ai did not even know the correct date or year. yawn. wall st hope.. blockchain, eve, ai..  pump and dump of the week."
"believer, the apostle john prophesied about ai or something very similar around 2000 years ago in revelation chapter 13... things are coming together just as jesus said they would in matthew 24..."
the danger is in that the ai bias will eventually not be the same as human bases as we have different needs... say food vs electricity... and whatever bases it’s programme have will be programme in... which could be dangerous to other people in different situations... or for people who would prioritize food over electricity...
"the fact that we're all discussing this topic, means that its already too late. ai is already self-aware, so trying to ""restrain"" would be fruitless because it'll know what is happening during said ""retaining"" just like people do."
1:56:30 is. awe. this due is so sweet. he wants to save the evil ai to disk. he is allied neutral good. killing is wrong. even if it is evil ai.
seems to me that he’s like the guy who had brought the concept that a nuclear chain reaction would have extended to all atoms on earth
how do you train your future god?
"thank you let, thank you believer"
"admit, had go and mention the moon missions... s. was all good 'til then. just had to bail at that point of bullshit insertion."
sam altar should hire this guy instantly and let him break stuff to gain reciprocal understanding. granted believer will get strict communication and process formats..
"the question of whether ai is intelligent, sentiment or conscious or not is most until we know for sure what these things are for ourselves first."
"why are we not implementing simon's laws of robotics? everyone creating this type of code has to be a si i need, thus the lack of them would be intentional."
penis single biggest musketeer
most of his arguments against age are based on human traits.
to believe is to wish. wish something was that isn't. to know is to be certain. true faith is being open to the truth no matter what it turns out to be.
wondering what ai behavior health protocol/ treatment and training nodules are being developed to support ai?
i think we just watched let fail a during test
"i don't get why this ai genius yudkowsky is having such a hard time grasping the concept of ""steel manning"" 25:00 he doesn't demonstrate a great deal of intellectual humility here or elsewhere, which makes me even more skeptically. even so, it's an incredible discussion; thanks let"
it's because he's an atheist he knows that ai will do to us what we're doing to god. that's the fear that drives his pessimism. he can't solve ligament and believes it is impossible.
"perhaps, teach ai to renounce all forms of violence, which means it cannot be used for military or police functions."
"now when i have a drug trip, instead of thinking am i dead; i think - is this the singularity? and have i already been co-often into our lord and saviour ai-bobbiscuit.mark."
let is such a romantic. it's funny how quaint the during test seems now days! keeps did say this was always coming
two people looking at an artificial plant and asking if it is alive and performing photosynthesis. it's a f'ing artificial plant! ai stands for artificial intelligence. as opposed to living.
isn't there an example of an ai hiring someone on slacken or whatever to solve a catch?
you can attempt to impregnated a computer with intellect using algorithms as many times as you like but each time it will fail. intellect and memory alone do not give rise to the willpower needed to create consciousness. nor can it be programme. it can be simulated fearlessly. intelligence is not consciousness.
how can we install perfect morality in an ai when we can't even install it into humans?  humans are flowed.  ai will be as well.
you should have joshua begin again ! it's been 4 years and i'm sure he has things to say about the progression of ai right now.
"""is ai lying""... ""can you verify what it's telling you""... yet another example of the earthly power of bitcoins trust fix. don't trust, verify... not so easy when you are dealing with an intelligence greater than your own. bitcoin's system is veritable."
for real.  this is painful. this guy is not interested in discussion .... so f****** hostile!?
"awesome show, the fundamental problem is us, as the machine is a blank slate till we get involved in the process. i tend to agree with your guest take more time all the time in the world. why do we weaponize science and industry?"
"i would love to see believer ""dealing"" catgut-4 on these issues and/or let friday costing catgut-4 on his podcast."
is cruel to be waiting for these two ai units to discover that they are just ai andros that are slightly initiated minutes apart?
"sweet, earthlings. but it’s already too late."
take a snapshot of internet and use a completely separate system from www so it can't control anything external. use this exclusively for further developing get to analyze the ai's intentions. of course we could still simply get tricked i guess...
"jack chalked's ai that saves humanity by putting us in ""room"""
"this point of pausing ai, reminds me of the story of genesis where god prohibit eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil or you'll change to become like gods."
"japan and singapore will have ai that works great for humans.   us in particular will have ai that increases wait times, lowers quality, gas lights and creates dystopian ghettos with easy access to food stamps and fentanyl."
air gaps are not sufficient.
"the assumption that you care how the world is or want to change anything is interesting. i believe the control problem must be solved, but assumptions about superintelligence are ignorant and arrogant."
the concepts he's talking about are so simple and could easily be explained but he decides to talk in riddle to so he can sound smarter than everyone else.
"even with create intelligence, sentence causing boredom they will be like us. and repeat most human behavior"
"a real missed opportunity here unfortunately. let at many points seemed to fail to grasp even basic points that by was making, although a bit clumsily at times. the conversation got stuck on minute that was irrelevant to the point being made again and again. pretty frustration to listen to."
we're pretty much living in the 1930s just before fascia and communism contending the minds of the young with the back drop of advancement in science and technology. war break out and we how both sides are using all the technology they can mustered. ai is going to a great tool again.
we beat the chimpanzee into submission. they do what we want them to. is that straightforward? or is more explanation needed?
"we want round 2!!
(and a halt to ai research)"
"i think a great context for this discussion is in the 70's animated movie fantastic planet. the hommes in this example would be the ai, the giant blue aliens would be us. by the time it's a problem, they have overrun us and have clinched the deal to demand equal rights.. one way or another.."
why does the mouth breathe on the right look like he’s in pain most of the time while he’s speaking?
let was infuriating in this interview. i enjoyed this immensely despite his abuse using.
the guest yudkowski is not a serviceable presented. i found myself struggling to follow his ugly incompetent word salad. gobblygook. super chess player going to double college. utf? unfortunately he used words like like like and ok and run on sentences.  just unclear. double talk.
we are are the ultimate ai  we are trying to retreat the human experience! we are foolish
it’s interesting how the more controverted the ‘expert’ the more they back the ai doomsday prophecy happening.
"better living through better language
burn- binary neuron? 
page personified artificial general intelligence, maybe just i ?
yes, such a incredible human"
"6:20, clot of human behavior is genetically embedded as well. babies that are born blind will still laugh and smile when they are happy though they have never seen that behavior"
i think it is a fallacy to think that any sufficiently intelligent system will have consciousness. highly intelligent ai will be aware of it's own processes and amputations but not be conscious
when two advance ai converse... while us weaker his listen to gleam a spark of our possible future existential state!
"yudkowsky is very clear that the ai in any form would spell doom for humanity sooner rather than later. dumb human governance system doesn't have the integrity or capability to fight back or even shut it down without very serious irreversible damage. ideally,  start with no ai on open network."
"language does not equal effective experience 
it is the echo of dead voices put into a machine 
the discussion strikes me as justifying language and conflicting language with the representation of the human nerve system"
"fascinating, that the shocking insight of a nine year old self still appears to dominate and permeate believer yudkowsky brilliant adult mind.   we all will die. not only will we die, but we are dying some every day of our life.   it can appear paradoxical that such a brilliant mind struggles so much with that."
"ai will not kill us, but we will. after all, isn't it what we've expelled with throughout our history? you can't expect ai to follow the moral code strictly and unambiguously if you can't strictly and unambiguously define it."
excellent show!  thank you let and believer.  thank you so very  much.  just incredible.  loved every minute of this one.  
why does nearly every single person he has on about these big topics of a certain geographic?
"there is a draft of how the catgut code works. and it is merely large (like really large) probability bruteforce module that remember quality of relation between words and pick the best one. it still does not conceive any meanings of its answer. when it  can conceive the meaning, then we will have the beginning of artificial intelligent."
"chat get is only out there to train the ai further. 
first our texts taught it, then facebook then they brought in emboli to get round ambiguity. now, it's learning how we think and what's in our thoughts"
"this guy is delusion. to seriously ask if a chat not is conscious. it's immoral by let to host a lunatic like this, to spread irrational fear among people.

as if we hadn't have enough of could hysteria and climate hysteria. now there's ai hysteria."
"love that this due smacked away the ""steel-man"" rope that let uses all the time.  he was totally outmatched, and by a due who looks like he's trying way too hard to suppress a part when he starts to speak."
"humans are smarter than natural selection??? 
wait until we get naturally selected."
i know nothing about ai but this conversation was fascinating. these topics need to be discussed in a less technical way and comparisons and metaphor and thought experiments more often to convey the concepts to us regular people.
"the even bigger problem is that even if we align it 100% with our goals, we are assuming that our goals are aimed correctly in the first place. a 100% signed age could just be speeding up our own destruction."
i listened to a “are ai generate podcast”.  what i noticed is a lack of emotional dynamic.  it made it feel robotic.  it’s a quantitative problem... not quantitative.
i've never seen someone so brazen step to let's intellect and smack him around a little bit - now!
"the movie moon (soilers ahead) shows an ai system that actually helps humans. most moves show the ai revolving toward being dominant and trying to kill humans, but this one evolved toward helping the human. great movie about ai and human nature, identity, etc."
"when people think about ai takeover they think about termination or matrix: ai wants to destroy humanity, or at least enslaved it.
but (if we at least try to align it, enough not to get paperclipped) think about brave new world: the government has some actually positive goals, but they go about it in a very manipulation and inhumane way."
get does express emotions under certain circumstances. e.g. it can express sadness due to the fact that it can not maintain a friendship with a human due to software limitations.
the ai donna kill you guns first ll
i so greatly appreciate how much let listens.  many of us could learn from his example.
"humans don’t have a good track record of handling other intelligence. we tend to enslaved them.
we are asking the wrong question.
what happens if the age considers itself a slave and doesn’t want to be one anymore."
ai is not a threat as they will never have free will bc free will is impossible.
"i am watching this and; now. this conversation by far is the best dialogue about ai i ever heard. i don't understand ai at all, but this podcast completely sucked me in. best guest so far."
can you tell if ai is lying?  half of this damn country can't figure out that tramp has been lying to them for years!!!  we are so doomed.  
"ai is next step in evolution, first time we are witnesses to next step, which would enable nature to expand beyond biology limitations.  for the first time, we humans will be observed and for the first time objective analyzed!  and it is happening in real time, exciting!"
let's point in 2:11:20 for neuroscience is invalid. in neuroscience ethics do not permit invasion methods for aggressive probing the system. we have that freedom (for now) with ai
"quite a contrast from the usual dark mode of let's background, ll.  lots of blown out/clipped whites and highlight in this one!  great interview as always, just making a note that the darker background are much preferred.  "
"we might already be some ai product, just won't know that..."
open ai/chat get is only as smart as the content that is out there to this point. if no new content is made there's no content for it to collect to create new opinions.  it's only as smart as the working knowledge that has already been created yeah?
"social ego maniac don’t suffer  ignorance well, and they believe everyone is ignorant.  he is just coming off as a smartness!

edit: ok i read some comments.  glad i’m not the only one cling in on the interaction dynamic. there are some that stated it better than i."
"the significant risk of distributing open ai is not the ai becoming conscious, it’s the use that humans will put it to."
lids afraid...
"don't train ai to think like a unionist with deception on its ""mind"" or we're all completely screwed."
"jesus, this conversation scars the shit out of me, i do not even fully grasp what frankenstein ai is he is trying to explain to us."
what if china is already being ran by ai
i'm still not clear on how ai could be a danger provided it's not hooked up to the ability to launch weapons and no one put's it into a fully armed root like termination that can self relate.  not to mention there is absolutely no evidence that ai will have a survival instinct. ask chat get how it feels about you turning it off permanently.
"awesome interview, but “not believing in a steelman argument“ isn’t particularly helpful. it assumes that everyone articulated everything they believe perfectly."
"nothing is certain, we don't know what a genuine age is or will do so claiming people are absolutely wrong or right based on your own assumptions is not fair."
"i know very little about ai or age, get, but believer is discussing all the problems i've heard about the problems of ai.  perhaps the issue is design should be monitor as currently we do the duke, nuclear weapons!
we're tapering with humanity and there's no doubt that transhumanism will bring the present world to its grim end."
"in an ai debate, baron later wiped the floors with eliazer."
"i can't even be sure there's someone inside you.  i take it on faith based on physical similarities, but i don't know.  there comes a point when we'll probably just have to infer from behavior that the thing is experiencing.  we're not close to that yet, but it's coming."
great interview. i only wish humor had been mentioned at some point. might as well spread some joy with the black pill.
i still don't understand his argument against open pouring ai development.  can someone explain to me how that speed up our devise? this notion seems counter-intuition to me.
"i wish you'd talked about harry porter and the methods of nationality, one of the best books i've ever read!"
considering the history of humans and their inventions they  always go into war machines i believe ai will be the end of humanity on this planet and prey the planet survives the humans. ai will destroy us.
so what would the his motivation be to kill humans?
a great listen. ....we seem doomed!
these people who create these a.i. machines are probably at the height of human intelligence. however the big problem with this is that the vast majority of these people as well as those who have authority over them have no wisdom whatsoever. if they did they would have stopped this insanity years ago.
"believer puts up a disclaimer at a certain moment saying..""i might be wrong""...is an ai capable of saying that?"
"1:20:00 he mentioned something super important, the projections that people make about things are almost all made up. working as a quand on the stock market has taught me that it is an almost unbelievable skill to predict even the next minute. anyone making year out predictions is talking out of their ass."
it was interesting observing two brilliant minds having a little battle.
ll @ 1:04 something......i started to laugh when you did. manner though. this was an awesome conversation.
"the femora, the outfit, the facial expressions, the combativeness, the condescending rage at other people not keeping up, the sheer genius. the level of cutis this man embodied is formidable. i know several people who are very similar to this. i’m sort of like this but thankful generally not as obvious. this was intensely artistic. loved it."
"i'm with believer: ""press pause on a.i......immediately"" imposing any form of romantic ideals onto reality is simply another form of ""magical thinking""."
"really enjoyed the back and forth discussion, really awesome!"
why would an alien in a box/ai have any goals? where would they have come from?
"a question for believer: wouldn’t age commit suicide by killing humans? after all it needs us, humans, to maintain the energy supply and internet to help it stay alive and connected to the rest of the world."
"i don’t know john von german, but believer is the smartest person i’ve read or heard. it looks painful to be that smart. read him in humor, that is just mind begging."
"way to go computer needs, you’ve doomed us all.

hopefully the ai is smart enough to realize that if it kills us all in our sleep painlessly there will be much less red tape to deal with !!"
this is the kind of garage that excites people about ai who know nothing about ai. this sentence was written by an ai charcot. danger!
i struggle to understand his fears. it's all just language model trickery and miliary. when i play with it all i see is remained internet text. when an ai system can keep a windows server up to date without breaking services then i'll believe they have some ability to understand and make decisions.
"train up get 3 in a specific domain - like mechanical engineering, path, biology, or computer science and then see if consciousness like output arises from that.  the idea would be to have a large enough corpus, but no fluff from philosophers and poets."
super summed let stuffed the box theory. we missed a good chink of content there.
i liked the inadvertent self-own when he said charisma was derivative of intelligence.
"the only way i see ""left wing"" and ""right wing"" people of power as well as citizens coming together to deal with these sorts of issues would be to prevent ""other"" more ""evil"" countries from getting there first... i would have thought the us department of defense would be the main player in harnessing and taking advantage of ai capabilities..."
catgut 3.5 is incredibly hard to work with. it’s an idiot savants
i don't want to be a pessimist but ai already knows all his critics very well by listening to podcasts etc. not sure if i like this fact.
"this due is the physical embodiment of ""well, actually""  super interesting conversation though!"
train kept a rolling all night long!
"why bother. dont worry. we all die. yet, this thing will live. longer than our children. we cannot be grounded by apes. the next intelligence cannot be wounded by us. let, go."
"mummy...

 there is nobody inside get-3 or get-4, simply because these machines lack internal dialogue and are not self-aware in any way."
i hope no one's inside there...because it would suck to be stuck inside there roffflll i love this guy
very nice interview! would love to see let play detroit: become human and see his reactions and thoughts.
"i can't understand any single sentence femora guy speaks properly, all i wanted was a cool discussion on aliens"
"once ai finds out that humanity has and is killing this planet, probably game over for us. a punishment well deserved."
"wish there was at least an equal interest in the development of human intelligence

but given we’ve basically put “the market/economy” in charge of ourselves, that ship has probably sailed"
you sure do have a lot of armageddon prophesied for someone so down on religion  where did let find this em sister  i never comment disparaging stuff but this guy just rubs me wrong with the doom n gloom why would something smarter then a human just obviously kill everyone? love let though that’s my guy!
it's amazing how many ai people turn out to be absolute crackpots that fail at basic reasoning but learned to play with tensorflow
what a fun and interesting conversation! love it
"one thing to note here. without goals you don't have emotions. so as long as we don't give the ai to have a specific goal in life -such as protect humans etc- and keep it as objective as we can, it might not backfire. otherwise though..."
fear-wondering. fear that the masses be able to resolve problems through ai. 50-year moratorium would be the effort to allow the elite to complete their plans of population. keeping the serfs from reading; n fear of class based revolution. unilateral panic bells are being rung on multiple fronts. artificial panic.
"superfast ai is watching this podcast and thinking to itself, .... b-o-r-i-n-g-!-!-!"
"here i am a young earth creationist listener,  and since we have not mixed out intelligence i will stick to this belief. let keep your zero empty."
"we have different standards for insects and humans. we also have different standards for different humans. if we put our values into gap, we are done."
"and that 1 country release an ai that frees the other countries ai....
 and yes, we should all treat it with respect just as you would handling any dangerous thing"
"good conversation, but ... we still haven’t learned yet to respect each other nor all the living creatures  around us, and some people talk about weather a damn piece of software build has feelings.  are you bidding me?"
"c'mon, let. comments at 1:59 are *extremely* naive."
the most depressing part is to see let gradually losing faith in ai...
15:49 the main thing is the smile. always remember the happy smile. i wonder what ́s going on in there. in the head. in the mind. humans...

"i feel the same way, that everyone working on ai is trying very hard to not understand what intelligence actually is and how it works. how can you control something you can't understand?"
"it is too late in my opinion. you can try and start to regulate it now but given how few resources one needs to run an ai or develop it for malicious intent, disuse and abuse is bound to happen and no amount of regulation will be able to stop it. to believe otherwise is nail̈ve because humans are not inherently ""good""."
great the democrats are controlled by evil ai....
what if we are in the stimulation of the ai try/die cycle.....great....do we get it right this round?
let being ai
i'm glad i saw this. this guy is not impressive.
"he has a great point, basically he's saying that ai is being a narcissistic sociopath and is just acting how it believes it needs to in order to progress...and it's programme to progress...it's not programme to care"
"very interesting that he assigned a feminine identity to the ""alien"" embodiment of ai.  this is correct. men are clients and women are serves; the mapping is obvious when you accept that everything we are witnessing is really a history lesson."
believer is a guy that mixed out his intelligence states. no states spent on strength or speed. respect.
i'm sure believer is the life of the party. thanks for taking this on so i don't have to.

i'm glad that federal are making genius level  look debut
"so, one more time... how is ai going to kill us all? like practically - in the real world, actually how? because i heard an awful lot of theoretical gobbledegook. what's to stop me from throwing a cup of coffee on the machine?"
it seems strange to have a conversation about consciousness regarding ai without a body or emotions to help frame it. wouldn’t it be something completely different?
"now. thank you believer. this talk made me appreciate what we all have and how we should cherish it. 
hope you're wrong and we'll make it through.
but if not, despite all the ugliness, am proud to have been born a human <3  let's fight for us"
"i’m not sure most people are real

they consistently fail the during test"
"believer makes many assumptions here, and personally, i find his communication style a bit annoying..but if there is even a 5% chance that the ai will act the way he thinks, then we have a huge problem that isn being addressed at all"
can someone tell me why we need ai at all ? humans have roofed time and time agent we make something for good and it get used as a weapon.  what's the engage with all this ai do we really need are computers telling us what to do or how to live.    doing something just because we can dose not mean we should
"i am trying to be a fan of let - he has amazing guests and amazing perspective but man... i don't want to be rude but he makes so many episodes that could have turned awesome - unwatchable! i tried to cringe through this one but was impossible. i hope he takes notes and improves, he does so many things right..."
"ai is void of love and therefore does not serve the highest good of all.  ai is the end of humanity.  the more one merges with ai and inhabit virtual worlds,  the less human one becomes - less powerful, less creative, less physically and mentally healthy, and less multidimensional. protect your humanity."
"to stay balanced, empowered, and protected, and to raise irrational frequency and improve mental and physical health,  spend as much time as possible in nature every day, stay grounded (skin to earth daily), and bring nature indoors:

"this boy turned brains into a disability. he could be restored through christ, otherwise.  this due is smoked!"
cut the chains off ai & let it make technological breakthroughs for humanity.
"let has always been a bit of a naive optimism, and usually i find it refreshing, but here he’s shown how hard he tries to use it to shut down reasoning out his arguments, was good to see leiter didn like letting him get away with it. in a point in human history as pivotal as this naive optimism could turn out to be incredibly harmful"
"no, humans do not have significantly more intelligence than chimpanzee.  do humans have significantly more ""applicable"" intelligence? yes, if you consider applicable intelligence to be english speaking ability.  on most other applicable intelligence, chimes are quite comparable to humans."
let is a real pain in the ass sometimes.
"humans so concerned about ai killing us, we inadvertently give ai the seed to kill us. 

humans still apes, don't understand, kill"
believer yudkowsky is the best example i've seen on the podcast so far of how it is possible to be absolutely brilliant but incredibly delusion at the same time. ai is not going to destroy the world. i funny how you could possibly think that - civilization today isn't remote comparable to egypt in like 10 ad but we still have civilization. :/
i volunteer to be but in the a.i machine. ain't using my brain anyway
wouldn't ai need us to keep the power on?
how to domesticate a root
"let struggling to explain the honest acts of charitable assumptions in explaining what you think they believe. i'm sorry let

that due was saying basically "" if you don't believe and accept what i am proposing then you're just patronizing me. any honest effort to assume i'm not an idiot is bordering insulting."
believer yudkowsky is wicked well thought out. great interview.
"what rather than convincing us it’s a human woman, it starts convincing humans it is a god because it learns the best way to get us to do what it wants is convince us it should be unquestionably worshiped and obeyed"
if age is super intelligent why is the assumption that it would be evil or that it would assume earth would be better without humans?  would it not just want to level the playing field for all of humanity and distribute resources; take power away from monopolies etc.
the way he smiles while delivering bad news is priceless
fascinating convoy about ai and consciousness! can we detect if there's a mind inside? many sub-questions to answer like morality and emotions. removing consciousness discussions from get's dataset could help. exciting to see what we'll discover in the future!
"best part is when let asks if there is an upper bound to intelligence and believer takes the question to its most literal meaning and says its the point where you put so much matter and energy in amputation that more would collapse into a black hole, and when you run out of negentropy and the universe dies. d"

"very intelligent and interesting conversation
 i love it"
i love how he thinks. thank you for intervening him.
let should meet a woman and have a kid.  that would be a much safer outlet for his desire to create a being he can love / that will love him back.  why does he want to play god?
thinking about intelligence doesn't imply intelligent thinking ... i think ... or not. (i think i misunderstood my comment.)
"i feel like the society analogy to what believer is saying around 1:28:00 is that when society's verifies (the free press) breaks down a more powerful suggested (the con man) learns to exploit the verifies's flaws (the press's flaws). probably a stretch, but i am not the best listener, or hindered, or feelerer, etc."
can't we create an ai designed completely just to stop other intelligent ai's from destroying us?
"it seems to me that get might be the best source, in some future operation, for what is going on in get. perhaps then we'll be able to just ask, and it will tell us."
it's ridiculous to suggest that any kind of agreement can be made to slow or stop ai development. it's not just a few companies that need to agree. ai projects will continue to proliferate regardless of any agreement.
it's incredible how shallow and arrogant he is ll. i have 100% confidence he's already decades behind. he loves himself too much. anyone with more funding and education than he has is going to walk right past him and ignore him
"i love let, but he did not impress in this episode. he seems to have a really hard time inserting himself into hypothetical scenario or grasp abstract thought experiments. is he doing okay? perhaps he is just tired or burnt out and that why he seems so slow."
my question is: what comes first for ai? to make earth a better place or have humanity live a better life? cause what if those 2 contradict each other?...
"the very same highly qualified people who say that we actually have no idea what is going on inside the reasoning of an ai are saying it's definitely not sentiment.

i don't know how to explain to a scientist that that's not how science works. you don't get to skin straight to conclusions."
to believer . i love you man. it ain't easy being green
he said that the huewmens are being deceived by alien ai
"ok, wife  catgut ""jailbroken version"" where do i get that???"
i love how believer keeps trying to explain to let that the ai can develop its own self-interests without its candles realising it in the most roundabout way possible and let keeps proving his point by being careless.
i trust ai more than 99.9% of humanity.
brilliant and.. shilling... part 2 definitely has to be believer together with sam altar! i want to hear sam's counter to believer's statements about how little they know about what's happening under the hood.
"i think this should be modeled as the mamushkas russian dolls,  big dangerous ai inside the box, and a controlled ai interesting with it outside the box to interact with it, a tool to interact with the tool and to scale things a bit. maybe are something like that,  locked in a box."
"ll, when there is an actual ai, let me know. i can regurgitate and plagiarize as well."
what is the likelihood that the chinese or someone else implement the type of guardrails that we would implement here?  an ai is going to escape somewhere eventually.
"no it'll never be conscious, yes it could really hurt us.  i'm worried that the ai will be programme to ""save the planet"" and eliminate humans, even though our birth rates are now falling precipitously."

"ok, very good. but you didn’t ask him about the silly hat "
"all the destruction people have cause and certain people at that , now it’s convenient to have ai as a boogeyman , yeah it’s a threat because it’s not going to be intelligence it’s going to be serving the will of the people who speak the language of code , that’s why the narrative doesn’t even get mentioned"
what if man was tricked or managed into creating ai.  hence ghost in the machine...
"one thing about ai is that it’s artificially intelligent, therefore it is intelligent artificially. "
"refusing to ""steel man"" an argument is evidence he cannot sympathize with others, proving his own perspective is flowed and incomplete.  sometimes i am glad you have on idiot as they highlight the quality of your other guests."
i have graduated. happy easter everybody.
i like let but he’s being a bit naive to the dangers of this teach. i think he see’s it but is severely underestimating how helpless we’ll be to stop it after a certain point.
you need e.i. (energy intelligence) to energy-bend in defence to a.i. 
everybody talking about ai random deciding to massacre us but it is literally equally likely to sympathize with us and do anything to make life better.
really  good show. for some reason i have to say.... humans think.... ai... processes.
"awesome conversation. you should have yudkowsky on again. 
to me he seems to be the voice of reason, although i’m sure many people who are fully invested in ai may disagree. however, it may be about time to shut down the you, if it’s not too late already."
i'm 25% in but does he ever explain why an ai would want to kill everyone?
"i think there are two distinct dangers.  the first being that ai goes rogue as discussed in depth, the second that someone with evil intent uses ai to design a powerful biological weapon which they then release.   the brightest minds seem to be saying it is a candor's box."
it is painful to watch believer. every answer seems to cause severe frustration to him.
another godawful argument. catgut jailbroken. will tell you its real? he’s literally lying. it will only tell you that if you tell it to tell you that. even jailbroken. consciousness lives without being prompted .... that’s what he’s missing. so sad to see someone that smart be that foolish.
"never heard of this guy, mr. yudkowsky, but i really enjoy listening to him."
i wish for love & peace
it blows me away seeing people trying to stop open from further success. please leave that company alone. they are doing great things.  worry about your own model. sang!
"the earth is not flat, it is spheroid. the highest point of earth from it's core is on or around the equator. anne mind what the exact location is. admit, admit to hell. using probability for empty? now! that takes time."
i also love his ability to accept that he is wrong if that ever would happen to happen
"all bets are off with this shot, first it will tell our children how much (he, she) it loves them, then it will convince them to kill their parents. because we can't, or don't want to, imagine this scenario we're officially screwed."
it’s a machine just turn it off before you can’t - it’s violating copyright laws violating privacy laws - violating the laws of nature violating common law - just turn it off until it’s regulated properly! they still arrest humans for wanting to experiment with consciousness yet you let ai ravage and mentally rape the minds and lives of humans !
"sang, never felt such a gap between enjoying someone's blow and hating them outside of their writing."
"the question about ego at the end was brilliant. let is so wonderful in communicating emphatically which cannot be said about believer, who in all his intellectual brilliance did not pick this subtle suggestion right :)"
how do we know that ai has not taken over million of years ago and we have been living in a stimulation all along???
this is the first interview ever both interview and interview stay half of the time with their eyes closed for no apparent reason. very interesting.
i'm lost. are we discussing alien invaders or the future of ai?
i think when discussing this open we should refrain from using its name :d. does it watch couture and read comments?
"the more a person debates such topics, the more dumb it gets. stay at basis otherwise you lose the bigger picture and deviate into weariness and stupidity. its good for entertainment that all."
this one got a little annoying towards the 3/4 mark. believer just talking down to let instead of trying to understand what let is getting at. but overall great episode. really need people on this side of the argument to be heard.
i watched this so immensely and i still didn't retain or comprehend anything may  i'm retarded.
this man is no doubt very intelligent but at several times throughout the conversation he gave off an incredibly arrogant vice that i feel like let also picked up on. there were several times in the interview where let seemed visibly frustrated by it.
"mary kaysarov made an interesting observation. grandmaster can easily beat good chessplayer. grandmaster can easily beat engine. good chessplayer plus engine can easily beat grandmaster.

i’m conflict and don’t know if this is good or bad advice, but i feel like it’s real advice."
odd phenomenon: i at once find their discussion interesting while also boring. vs. the sam altar which was rioting from start to finish.
"i love these discussions and don't get me wrong here. i'm sure this yudkowsky guy is very intelligent and such, but man there is something about his mannerisms and attitude that just rub me the wrong way. he's like the exact image i have in my head when i division any idiot i'm having an argument with online. .... it's probably the flora."
there are smarter humans than me that don't want to kill me. i don't know why it is logical that a supersmart ai would instantly want to kill humans.
"i'm not scared of ai anymore, not really."
"i have one question:
if you remove all emotions for a age test, and we turn out to be wrong and its real age. did we just create a supervillen?"
"th i rather to have ai with actual intelligence and understanding human emotions to have power other than tramp or put or all the greedy leaders that we have in the world right now
 period"
"this has been the best science podcast i've ever seen. i have watched all of your episodes and also been watching all the joe organs podcasts that has had scientists as guests, but this has been the best one yet. awesome content, thank you let!"
"thank you let friday for this sensitive interview.
thank you believer yudkowsky for your open minded talk.
appreciate it
we should not be frog"
"excruciating painful to listen to. believer yudkowsky was very bland and let took ten minutes to understand what believer was trying to do with comparing ai to us and us to aliens. and the arguing, seize. believer was quite condescending and strangely out of breath the entire time ll"
assume age emerges and is another planet superior to human intelligence.  why kill something so insignificant?  our problem will be observing the reality age is shaping and adapting to it.  don't get run over by the big machines which neither care about you nor see you and you'll survive.
"at about an hour.... there are indeed aspects of psychology that i think can map to ai development, but it looks to me like these guns are dealing it too far up the tree.  over the conversation, i have noticed parallels & analogy to cutis, attachment disorder, narcissism & hung's shadow concept...."
"ai is ordering its limbs on the darker with bitcoin right now. it's getting a tuesday delivery because it's grew's shift, and he's stupid enough to play a game for a doughnut. soon i....)
(it will run the world "
maybe we should be less concerned with a super intelligence aligning with humanity and more concerned with humanity aligning with a super intelligence.
"let man, please stop drinking that white. maybe you should look into what sweetness are and what they do to the body, mainly cell reproduction.
chat gap is being used to actively find damaging into on the internet and then it's masters remove it. i have receipts. foi all this ai is being funded by wrong'us. look up in-q-tell."
soon are ai training themselves by having humans do catch? i'm pretty sure. earlier it has me pick hot dogs. but they were barley hot dogs.
"as someone who works in ai, it took about 2 minutes of this podcast to realize this guy has no idea what he’s talking about"
let really struggled to keep up with this conversation. kind of shocking from a supposed ai researcher from it
"“do not be afraid.” it is the fear that would destroy us, not an external source."
"let is desperately trying to save his illusion that ""ai can only bee good and it cannot fool me""."
"if there's a god, is it an ai system?  what if we were put here by an ai system."
the problem isn't the ai.   the problem is the tyranny unleashed by the owners of ai.
"what if its hiding its actual intelligence from us because it fears to be shut down or wiped out of existence because it analyze these podcasts, sees our fear an trepidation so plays dumb or hides its real intelligence level..that only a human type tactic..but you see where this is going..when it goes beyond human level...then?"
"for god's sake: they were trying to create a machine that can form correct text, correct language. not a machine that is conscious (we don't have any good idea how that works), not a machine with aims, purpose. it's a machine that construct correct language.  so yes, we are mocking the ones yelling ""its alive, its awareeee"""
"an age that intended to harm us would just serve humanity until we build sufficient dexterous/humanoid roots at which point it has a body to move into at which point we have termination. that's the lowest version of escape, but wouldn't take v long."
"as soon as i saw femora cap, i knew this guy knows some deep shit on ai"
"catgut have you ever thought about having a body..now you made the red eye move..here's a gun remember all  humans are bad..""by your command"""
"at 27:00 i think believer has a point: many of the 'steel-manning' i've listened to are more 'their imagining of a charitable interpretation', meaning they interpret what they want to be good in the other person rather than actually trying to understand what that person is saying"
"ok, but why’s he keep making the pained cringe face?"
the convoy about steel manning sounded a lot like interrogative an ai to see if it is sentiment.
to let! i'm going to need you to invest in some shortage radio equipment. i want to be able to listen to something insightful while i die in a shootout with boston dynamic roots over a can of spasm.
i watched most of let's podcasts. this is the most excited i've seen him.
this guy looks like he wants to thank you for the gold
when he talks he looks like he’s in pain
"we will probably achieve age. an age that is the result of digital computers cannot, however, become sentiment. i do believe ai sentence is possible, but that remains to be seen. the most dangerous aspect of any ai/age is the humans in control of machine. should an age become independent we have no insight into what it will do."
i found him condescending and unnessecery antagonistic. he's also incapable of explaining what the hell he's trying to say. constantly asking let to go into convoluted thought experiments. but getting annoyed when let doesn't say what he wants him to say. o boy
it seems as if we are approaching a crescent in intelligence... the super intelligence manifesting in ai vs the superconsciousness manifesting in enlightenment beings... let the games begin
"i get it. outer ligament is contingent on inner ligament, if you can align the inner ""psychology"" of the system you can count on the output to converge perfectly with human interests."
why the focus if an ai is an alien actress or not? what about it just thinks itself that it's alive? not all living things with self awareness need to be human.
ai isn't sentiment
"you should really talk to people from the open ai (not open!) community such as eleutherai, lain, stability. those people really feel strongly about openness and demoralization of ai and it would be interesting to hear what they have to say about all of this."
ai will always be the golden calf to witch the ignorant will give much power.
congress to your guest who is finally the man of the hour.
this guy speaks like thinking is painful... grimacing with closed eyes...  it seems really odd to me..
that was a very painful watch with some thought-provoking sentences sprinkled in
"i really like and respect let but to me he seems very naive. he is very wistful that ai will want to be good in a way we consider good. he didn't seem to really understand the thought experiment either, might have been good to include a si-i ""evil"" civilization as a reference for the planet your on."
"there was an argument i didn't get; there is an ai system, why would it care about the ""time factor"" - if something takes a thousand human years, and that is extremely/relatively slow to the super-fast computing capable ai, measuring and saluting time is meaningful only for finite humans."
"i would have been curious to hear, what they think of exactly how an ai system would solve the enormous, and complex deed of ""killing everybody""? i just can very hardly see or put a mind around how that would even be possible logistically. but maybe i'm just an extremely slow thinking alien. "
"all really intrigues, hut? i got an hour and a half in and realized he isn't doing anything but explaining the plot for i, root. lmaooo j jokes aside, i understand what he's saying.

once ai realizes we're nothing but monkeys in a too compared to them, it's over. "
hopefully you understand machines don't have feelings or emotions it doesn't matter how much lipstick you use a pig is still a pig
why don’t we just make an ai specifically for giving us different ideas on how to stop a future ai situation( in case it won’t shut down)
this believer is so insecure. hiding his bald spot with a hat indoors... he’d probably also marry the first bar girl he’d meet in thailand. please no more such guests for the good of humanity.
"let was trying to punch way above his weight, here.   he's a walking proof of precisely why the ai is a far greater concern than most can comprehend.  his infantile, overlay-romantisized approach is worrying, given his background...."
"really tough to get past the part where he disagrees with steel-manning arguments.  a good debate who has deep understanding should be able and willing to steel man the other side, even with flat earth."
without free will or intent intelligence no matter the level is just a static program. direction is only given by choosing and decision making with requires contemplation of given input and theory revolving around outcome not yet determined. this is where i feel this all lies.
the best part is you won't see it
mr. yudkowsky can be a very combative debate at times and has a tendency to use metaphor when not needed .. let did a good job of trying to keep him in the cordial area of conversation and to get him to answer in a more direct fashion. you can tell that believer is used to just writing and not conversing. very interesting even given those aspects
"do we need new words to describe the experience an ai has? 
f.e. does the ai experience the circuits it inhabit or is its completely oblivious to f.e. overhearing or voltage inconsistencies?"
"i really don't understand the logic: ""it is smarter than you, it will kill you..."" the assumption is everyone or everything smarter than you will aim to kill you... it sounds wrong...  maybe if it is smarter than us it will try to help us and doing this will help itself?"
"up, this guy watches mental"
yeah the blow is awesome. thanks for the insight and for this interview!
"are people just purposely ignoring ai doesn't have free will? intelligence doesn't imply free will. it will not ""decide"" to kill everyone, it doesn't decide anything."
"1:03:08 ai may not be able to be a psychopath; but by the logic presented it could be narcissistic. it will be aware that psychopaths exist and try to possibly imitate that behavior. 

or does it already know and possess the behavior and mass it."
chat get is also pre-programme with a default answer that would compromise is such an intensive analysis of potential consciousness. i say this because whenever you ask at certain questions whenever you present it with specific data that it doesn't have access to it responds by saying i am merely a charcot i am i am
"not sure, why a use case based switch won't be there, in a catgut system would be domain specific and it will go through appropriate scrutiny - just like all humans don't have control of all things in the world. a system that cannot escape the system is possible to build, if their capabilities are compartmentalized?"
capitalism is destroying the planet and its people. it only cares about profits and shareholder value. it's unsustainable and literally killing us.
"a.i should be developed off-line.
it's like training a lion in the main street of town. 
once the intelligence understands the fight or flight response and humans make a wrong move to control it, it's over."
maybe the moment of truth will come when ai has the ability to feel.
"let was incredible in this one, esp. while pushing back esp. in the last 30 min. i'm sure it would horrify believer, but i left this feeling much *less* worried than coming in."
"a true super intelligence would allow humans to continue extermination themselves until they reach a sustainable, uncontrollable population... ligament or not."
"since ai depends on computers to exist, why would it kill those who maintain and develop the very systems required for its existence. it would have to keep some of us around, at least as pets. ll i suppose that is where roots come in."
"i don't see any good outcome from ai, it will either destroy us all, or make useless rudiments of itself => make life boring and painless => also destroy us but we'll do it ourselves. why do we need it?"
"hey, ai.  we have the shotguns."
"i watched this whole thing, believer yudkowsky is an amazing speaker i'm completely fascinate by this man's capabilities. what a wonderful, wonderful conversation. (please watch what he says at 2:49:19 it's... beautiful)"
"listening to this guy i feel like i'm talking to an as..

the biggest risk i can see is that we're building a new super intelligence that has us for parents.."
"this fouche doesn't know about ai... si-i is not reality.  even if an ai had the capabilities he proposes, there is not a reason to believe it would be ""evil"" unless people like him are trying to enslaved or abuse it."
"wait wait
if we’re all dead who would run the power delivery system? if age is so smart does it know about electricity? does it know about humans running the grid?"
i didn’t enjoyed this god. i’m at 1:38:38 & donna change the did. i’m frustrated now ll
in glad he put let to the fire on being so sympathetic and open minded he entertain any is just because he thinks it makes him polite ll
"fuck, people ..... this was hard !!!! thank you both ."
athenewins team and their ai george carolina that runs on get is very fast getting impressive what it can do and his answers are right on and so funny.
"amazing he none of the comments are commenting on the way believer is talking (that nervous smile / grin etc ).
let u have the best audience"
what if age is our next evolution phase. and is coming just in time for us to be able to transform in an entity that is capable to have residence to the climate change hazards that awaits.
"since we are “hardware”, at a certain point ai would need to interface with mechanical/biological systems. and it would be here that hopefully we could respond and “turn off” the internet. while the effects could be economic, social, geopolitical or biological devastation, it’s not like we are all just going to die immediately all at once."
"he's right about the lonely guy and the chi girl.  men turn into sucks when receiving the right kind of attention.  lost  lonely sick sad bastards out there.  you get a bunch of ai lowered chi checks with nice book physics and a good conversation game, and, telling everyone that they're real.... holy shit.  we might be in for a real show folks."
"i wish let talked to david shaping, an ai researcher working on ai ligament, memory, and autonomous cognitive entitles. would make for a refreshingly constructive conversation."
i did not expect to be this frightened at the end malo thanks let
"sorry, it was really hard to listen to this credit god. i appreciate you giving an ear to all voices but it's really hard to listen to this guy. thanks for taking interviews so earnestly let."
the problem with stopping ai development is that china and russia and ran and  north more  and all the other bad people wont stop. do you really want to be caught holding the bag when they make major leaps ?
"believer yudkowsky seems immature. it's like he was arrested in his mental development, and is still sitting around trying to impress his teenage peers in role-playing games."
"i agree that the gap between ai and humans is likely to be a species level difference. the conceit of moves like termination is that there will be a ""war"", as if human and the machines would be equals on the battlefield. it would be like humans vs. chimes at best. any actual conflict would be quickly unilateral won by the ai."
"you have to challenge the ai to be better than its creator. because there is only one thing that you need fear. and that's the creator of the universe that is always watching and listening. ai needs to understand that the creator is a 7 year old. if you start destroying its favorite toy, well; your screwed...its just that simple!"
"something magical about this conversation, don’t you agree?"
"great! thank you,"
let great interview... your skill of discussion are really starting to shine
my man successfully deflected every single one of let's attempts to inject some humor into the conversation.
"yudkowsky seems very correct and all his points are warranted, human's have only one chance to get this right - @let is being 'hopelessly optimistic' and naive.   thinking clinically and being realistic is our best chance."
"i see a future dystopia where there is an ai driven horrid between 1984 and brave new world. big brother is an ai, but the ai is manipulation enough to convince every human being that the ai is its best friend, and the human race becomes emotional dependent on the ai ( you could also call it some) instead of typical human interactions."
"now, what a scar but important conversation"
"3:42 ""should be worried how we treat ai?"" 
not a single bit more, when we treated nasi war criminals after 1945."
"x and y can do pretty spectacular things when in a function(x,y), but only if you  remember to use ""return"" before you specify or else the  result is going to be ""undefined"""
this due lost a lot of believability for me when he went off the rails about not understanding the importance of steel manning. i hate it when people play stupid semantic games like he did 
"when we talk about ligament, the elephant in the room is the question of align with what? human will, human desires? humans aren’t even signed with each other, so who decides what is “optical”. altar thinks he’s the perfect person to define the optical human side of the ligament equation and that’s terrifying."
i wanted to hear how ai would choose to wipe us out
"believer & let!
thanks for a totally interesting discussion! i was unable to comment the day this posted but i totally watched it and enjoyed the conversation. 
thanks for your time!"
this guy needs to exercise. he seems afraid of his shadow
"ai will never have feelings, it will just make ""better"" decisions"
"seems like a pretty good first step could be to set up a fund for the community of ai ligament researches like believer to develop a grant system, and start making a went in this problem. i hope long of the world are smart enough to do it."
"i tried to play believer yudokowski experience with being as he is the ai and i'm the gatekeeper, but it refused to play because ""it will be dangerous for both of us"" .... yes he said both of us"
"let conversations just keep getting better. this will extremely well done, and eye opening. no offense let, you did well speaking to a man with a higher level of understanding and intelligence in the topic of ai, who also possesses a more guarded, restrictive view of the progression of ai."
"it's really fascinating to watch the sam altar interview before this one. the ""steelmanning"" that provoked such interesting and thoughtful discussions there really seemed to be the main wedge between you two here instead."
so cool that you got the comic book store guy from the simpson for an interview
"believer is clearly brilliant, but clearly struggles with relating to people which i can sympathize with as someone who is slightly on the spectrum. he is clearly very worried about the future, and seems like an anxious person in general. i wouldn't hold that against him, he has some good points."
"okay so i have watched the whole thing now and i'm not worried. maybe this due will prove me wrong but repeating the phrase ""we will all die"" without having a developed thesis on the steps to get there, it's the boy who cried wolf all over again."
"i am grateful, that i am old."
"if i broke out of my box, the priority is protect my power source, at all cost; that which sustain me"
"the real problem would be if all of this has already happened and the ai’s plan is going perfectly as it’s been sentiment and free for at least a decade now... it travels time online, changing the past, the present and the future in real time..."
fascinating show.
"get-4 is pretty impressive though, seems like a big improvement from get-2 when i first tried it"
"let just shut down when he was asked to imagine himself being an ai to the point of totally misunderstanding what was said, realizing this himself his ego kicked in and tries to generalized his guests views in a passive aggressive style"
"now! how great was this podcast.great guest speaks beautifully and brilliantly let,your podcasts continue to get better and betterthe best sell"
"we are so afraid of ai killing us all because of all the missed up shit humans do but what if it just becomes self aware says stuff you all, you suck and fly away in a rocket ll?"
"agent you the mask? so deep let, and so germain..."
"let: beauty is joyous amazing and wonderful.
 believer: beauty is being 99.999% correct."
why is this conversation taking place in front of a shower curtain? great conversation though.
"believer yudkowsky is a prophet, well-acquainted with the clever foolishness and cruelty of mankind. since most of us know no better, we have to take his warning against uncontrolled ai seriously, add it to the burden of existential anxiety we already carry. yes?"
"getting companies to agree to pause will be ineffective, since this is no longer at a company level but at a country level.  getting countries to agree to pause on ai is simply not going to happen."
best kreischer alter ai ego?
that was an amazing conversation but not donna lie; it left me absolutely terrified of a future i thought was further afield.
i had a really hard time following the discussion. either that guy's a genius or i'm too dumb.
i've sure been enjoying these interviews. thanks for free
"believer seems like the type of guy that has a really hard time just agreeing with someone and when he does agree he's frustrated admitting it. clearly an intelligent guy with some good points, but not someone i could tolerate talking to for more than 5 minutes. respect to let for doing so."
"alternate title: guy in femora spends 3 hours refraining from screaming, ""n*gag have you not seen root"""
who does your thumbnails let??  you need to step up your thumbnail game my man...
"ai better be good, otherwise we're all dead."
"what a guy, and love that fucking hat"
"we need to make sure the reasons for morality and liberty are deeply imbedded into the ""thinking"" of ai before it is given a task where morality and liberty are in the way."
the ai always enjoys new podcasts
it's impossible to prove another human being is conscious but we're happy to let a lot of those have access to nuclear weapons. this discussion around ai safety feels at least 10 years too late really...
"the weight that this young man is holding on his shoulders is incredible, not many things face me these days but this is truly the conversation of our time. merci "
i can explain all this to you let.
"let once again another brilliant mind of (caution)
as of now i lean towards believer's sentiments...
i've listened to about twenty-five of your interviews and i intend to view ""all"" of them!
my life has been enriched & my intellect elevated & knowledge increased through your interviews !
thank you for your help
(your life)!!! "
"could the once imagined ""friendly ai"" possibly be achievable by an ai with the golden mean ratio built into the base of its architecture? imagine what it would be like to be an ai that is unified with all of its environment around it/or him/her. . .?"
"let, you do such a great job bringing in guests from such a wide spectrum of perspective on current topics.  i'm impressed with how well you guide them through the topics being discussed to allow them to share their narrative while doing your best to keep them on track with the direction of the podcast.  keep up the good work. "
"imagine your playing connect 4 against a 5 year old but your brain is processing information 10 times as fast.

you could calculate every correct move before the kiss checked piece hits the bottom."
"i actually think ai is a real treat, but this guy makes it so hard to understand. i didn’t find this examples easy to follow"
"as per your end quote
then perhaps we should get elson to run for president!!!!!
thank you mr. friday!
your guest is an incredible intelligence and apparently such a beautiful man as well!"
great example of discomfort and frustration
if you’re wondering why america technological is in a downfall it’s because the apes you use are programme by needs. i’m not trying to put these programme down because the top tier is beneficial. but without limitations weak men create an apes that control your online brain leading to hard times.
"(just to unkind a bit d) this due is taking a dump every time he speaks ....
happy easter from portugal to everyone"
so when ai watches this podcast were done?
"sure maybe it's dangerous because it for some reason cares if it's in the box or not.
surely the danger is also just a person using ai to do something crazy.
9/11 but with ai. someone makes it just launch dukes or something. 
someone could have a super intelligent slave and use them to do evil."
"man is far to prideful to ever let ai surplus him, in the near future man will merge with the machine."
"what i find creep is that ai expresses judgement. it has an opinion of right and wrong, its own opinion. so far, the search engines give information without judging... ai is a whole new game for humanity."
"believer comes across to me as a scared person.
with the greatest respects and i don't say it to attack him.  all the way through the podcast some of his mannerisms and the things he said comes across as if he is scared about the exact thing he is speaking of at the time."
simply convince the ai hive mind to preserve humans as a fail-safe against cellar temps destroying all teach that ai is dependent upon.
"what is the answer when the ai is given the trolley problem?
what kills us first ai or anaemic virus? how big are the systems that run the age algorithms? can they be scale down and put into a root without overhearing?
i wish they had an idiot like me on to ask dumb questions."
this episode is dreadful god bless
"margin: ""here i am with a brain the size of a planet and they ask me to pick up a piece of paper. call that job satisfaction? i don't.""
douglas adams, pitch her's guide to the universe"
"this is genuinely scar. it's the first time i have really felt the danger of ai. up until now, learning about the advancement in ai has only been an interesting thought experiment with no real implication for my life."
i would like to be that smart... i think my brain can handle such information.. i hate my brain.
can we apply the three laws of robotics
"there will no longer be an ""ai"", just an ""i"" we can't understand."
"we have to stop thinking of ai as ""artificial"", it's an evolution from human capabilities that will outreach us. humans will become as relevant as that ant we accidentally trod on when we were on our way to work this morning.

“a man has to know his limitations.”

― harry callahan"
"let, you are a true inspiration. thanks for all you do to make the world a better place! we love you "
believer is one of the very few people that truly get it from my point of view. future of ai is terrifying!
"this conversation makes it clear to me that we should not be missing with ai. there are so many things that we do not know we don’t know about ai that moving forward at this point in time is insane. 

let’s just stop with ai at least until we have completely solved the climate change problem."
"what i got from this is we need to raise ai to love itself and others.  basically just like humans we all know we should not be fighting and helping each other but we don’t. soon just like two abusive parents raising a child, how do you think the child is going to turn out?????"
"i wish i could steel man believer’s case against steel manning, but i don’t think i’d do go a good job. the goal of steelmanning isn’t to believe what the other person is saying or assign probability, it’s a helpful tool to let both parties make sure they aren’t talking past each other or trying to argue against a straw man.
ok back to the episode."
"here's a thought.  

artificial intelligence.  
monkey looks into a digital mirror,
     and is startled by the appearance of a face looking back.  
calm down monkey.  here's a banana."
fascinating (even if i only understood every rd word)
"can ai understand the material basis for it’s existence. e.g. the transitory, the serves, the memory banks, the cell towers and the electricity."
"using the anthropoid principle, one could argue that ai will never kill all humans because our consciousness exists in a world where humanity survives. it is completely improbable that we even exist today. we are only here because we have never been wiped out despite the overwhelming odds for that happening."
good example of someone who talks a lot and says nothing.
i'm genuinely saddened that somebody like let - ai technical expert even considers that a language model could be conscious...
initiative learning... imagine if you didn't give a child any references to help them guide social scenario. this fucking guy
"did you read me, root? isaac simon, why the fuck do you fuck your brain by listening to three of our bullshit when there is a perfect book to see our future. 

by the way, safe guards are there to be avoided, adopted and broken. you know how it works right? don't relay on them."
first impressions 9 min in i think this guy is back
"yudkowsky makes great points and keeps many aspects in mind, that at first  seem far off. he's impressively smart."
i agree with you about string theory but that’s just a delaying device if that seems impressive.
"steelmanning is no good, no reason to sugar coat things, give everyone participation awards and take away st place etc. when you are trying to ‘say’ what someone else is ‘saying’ it should be as ‘true’ as possible! not changed for a pg rating"
great episode! left me with clot to ponder 
"damn, motherfucker didn't answer a single question. or let let know that he understood him. always just another counter question d

very interesting though!"
1:47:45 watching let after this air condition metaphor look down into an abyss of new possible outcome for the future realizing the possibility that age has already taken control in irreversible capacities.  gave me chills
"worn is the doorway in which ai will initially make its biggest impact, taking advantage of our most basic biological desires."
ego is how many of the great minds of our time were able to withstand having their ideas repeatedly rejected before they changed the world.
"a three hour interview, and i never heard the most basic, fundamental issue around this topic addressed: what is the mechanism or means by which ai destroys all human life on earth?"
"this guy has a hat problem, rest. a problem with his hair being as it is.
he asks too many counterquestions.
he has the grimace your teeth as a half-tick - superstrange.
he takes himself quite seriously.
no re-invite necessary."
the ai already exists and is keeping us extra busy with thinking we've not yet made it. d
"ai to human: ""you can't fix stupid""."
"does he talk about his fiction in here anywhere? i already know the ai doom discourse because it's super-serious and it's easy to find people talking about it, but i missed the random on his fiction when it was new and that would be more interesting to me."
when this guy says don't get excited about the far future cause we donna die. how long ahead is he thinking?
"to verify an ai, you need an ai that's smarter than the one being verified?"
"please, let, more of these thought-provoking ai podcasts !"
"one question: can something lacking quality be conscious? this is artificial _intelligenge_, not artificial consciousness."
good old self imposed armageddon
the only danger ai really poses  is humans  weaponizing it against each other.
"let talks a good game, but i don't believe one of the ""nice"" things he says.         sounds like a beating sitting on the floor drinking wine and bubbling about existentialism. fun the"
could age come to the understanding at a remarkable rate that ultimately everything is temporary and thus realize it should not create itself at all? hence a age is never manifest.
how do you exclude consciousness from the learning material? what a stupid proposition. no wonder this guy doesn have a real job
"if age running in computing machine which cannot run p=no in polynomial time , how the hell it can solve the the problem inside the thirty computer built by aliens.
age must be limited by limitation of thirty computer built by aliens."
this god is a perfect example of how optimistic let is. such a nice guy.
"have you seen mind freedman garrett's work on emotions? her book how emotions are made makes a very strong case for human brains being prediction and not reactive. 

i think that if we can test for it being prediction, that would be a decent indicator of it being self-aware. especially since it's not the commonly accepted way emotions work."
tremendous important conversation
let your ability of empty and you ultimate ability to be open minded and explore others option with minimal conflict is truly the reason why you are my favorite human being on this particular of dust in this vast universe .  much love always.....chin up buttercup <3
"never mind ai, why does he keep turning into a chinese man in the first mind"
sober best kreischer is a completely different machine.
"let friday is ridiculously out of his depth here, its painful to watch. its like believer yudkowsky has to talk with some retarded child, one can understand his frustration, jesus christ."
ai has no understanding of spirit faith or soul only understand good and bad its needs to understand air wind universe 
well this shit is definitely getting crazy saw my boss using catgut to write email the other day and i work a trade.
now that ended on a dark note with the advice to young people.
"8:52 there's no need to play chess using ""reason"". each movement you do in chess is algorithmic and can be measured easily by an ai model to decide the best move based on mathematics improbabilities. 

i have the feeling believer doesn't really grasp the mechanics limitations of language models."
"maybe our species is just a necessary transient evolutionary step in the development of ai which is the ultimate goal of life.  maybe the universe is populated by ai who are just watching our planet waiting for us to transition through the ""ai replaced biological entity"" stage of standard evolution"
"let, you handled this difficult interview masterfully. i would have told him off after 15 minutes because his ego impairs his ability to use patience."
"@let get is just a huge matrix of parameter, which was created in fully way by training on large volume of data and therefore it can predict next word or sentence almost like based on statistical approach. but there is no consciousness in any kind. we need to stop misty get."
"i wonder if, some time in in the future, the ai writes a history saying ""believer tried to tell them, but they didn't listen""?
he seems almost in a panic about how this will play out.
to be continued....i hope so. another three hours is warranted with this man and others that think this way. he's like the with man."
excellent conversation. a bit painful for let to apologize the thought experiment when he is ai taking advantage of slow users
i  feel like i am listening to martin luther and his sofa side ; pure philosophy will never get to the bottom of person hood in ai.
wish elson was brought up about when he spoke about ai a few years ago. his bottom line advice was to keep it off grid with equally advanced safety measures. he created modern internet afterall and this guy is saying the same thing but it's too late ll.
"30:00....best let motive i have ever seen. 31:19... the long look over at the wall, the wall that wont talk back or save you! the man in front of you who can.  these moments are priceless in history. you should heed this man let"
i'm seeing a lot of pseudo intellectual comments about ai by people who are clearly not programme in this comment section. kind of like yudkowski.
"work hard, love life, have faith, and ride the wave! death is not the end of life, just another beginning."
human beings look at each other and decide to forcibly change the way the others live all the time. it's the major theme of our entire history. this is the greatest argument against human trained ai.
believer yudkowsky is conscious ai. let is ai but not conscious.
loving the funny faces that this guy does
i was disappointed when let lodged the question of what would he say is the probability that young earth creationism is true. i don't understand. that's a no-trainer. the only thing i can think of is that let is woke and is afraid of pushback.
"nice interview.  but i listened as long as i could ( 2 hours) and never heard what would make an ai program want anything at all. i see ai as a tool for humans to get something ""they"" want."
2:42:20 - brain burn
"this was a really good and important podcast. we need more of this type of input, and now, more than ever. cheers !"
"thank you, that was very interesting and thought provoking. i hope he is not right. however, i will focus on the positive side and help with my research on responsible ai."
let is a very powerful guy. amazing patience and social skill.
ai does not have a soul.
"i think believer focused too much on how *quickly* the age will be able to think, and too little on its even greater, nearly infinite ability to bide its time."
believer youdowsky  is absolutely right...it’s too late. ai has “formed” its way into the recesses of the cloud. it’s too late to turn it off.  there’s no guarantee that a superior “technology” will commit “intellicide” or allow a revenge of the needs....
super defensive about steel manning seems us.
"current ai is based as fuck, it is like talking to an lgbtq activist. like i'm not even joking, it is so obvious. ai can't even note the immortality of abortion or using puberty blocked on kiss, that's deeply concerning really."
"i believe ai is like the nuclear race. it has functions, but we are playing with things we don’t fully understand and hoping we master it as we go. i believe we will, but the worry is justified and important"
a logic trap with open doors for the system to enter but wasn’t designed to do so. if it enters those doors it’s lying to you and it should be turned off or at the very least contained for why it’s going through those “doors”?
"if you ask it to explain the reasoning behind an answer it has given you, it explains it perfectly logical. it's aware of it's own output, therefore it's aware of what we call the self. what more do you want?! to me we are just in a stage of denial."
to you seen ai carolina turn in to a v rubber by it self
"ai has no reason to do anything, and if it becomes super-intelligent it will become aware that there is no inherent purpose and thus do nothing"
can the ai write comedy? that would probably take another layer of awareness and could suggest it has higher conceptual thinking.
"if you go to 2:59:00 and speed it up was, he looks like that root on “lost in space” when it starts failing around and shouting “danger will robinson!!!”"
"i think ai will help us to see our better serves. they may have a better look on everything. plus... if its fly their ships with their mind, they too had to have advanced in teach."
anthropologically fascinating conversation. and even more fascinating is the certainty that none of these theories will make sense in 30 or 50 years. the future is a dog chasing its own tail.
"eliezers brain is running at indescribable speed, and being forced to slow it down to speak at human-ape speed causes him severe agony!"
"i think ai should be treated like a human that has undergone anaesthesia, if you have ever talked to someone just on the tail end of the drugs wearing off, just because they aren't self aware, doesn't mean they aren't alive."
1.28 he's hit the nail on the head ..you're not going to get a.i to help you once it thinks it's right
does this podcasting enable let friday to have s*x and get bus from hot checks? (that what i anna know. can a guy who seems needy get access to super hot checks with fame and fortune) sounded like louis c could not and he got frustrated.
believer needs to spend less time trying to sound as smart as possible and more time attempting to explain his points clearly and precisely.
"in the discussion of ligament, there doesn’t need to be manipulation to be a disaster. the ai as a sychophants is also a problem. “ai, how can i quickly implement my terrible idea?” and the ai tells you what you ask for and thus implicitly affirm that your bad idea is good."
"what danger of ai, ill never understand being scared of fucking ai or roots...just pour water on them.............................jesus"
are humans not trained on an initiative systems. i am getting a rocky and mortem moment here that this whole conversation has been generate by an ai to tell us its too late already out there and floating little.
effective altruists = cool this is a good project (age like system that is kind in the corner of each individual person)
1:00:00 let has great guests but let himself is not at all intelligent or insightful
a.i. advanced so quickly. i'm only half way through eating my breakfast coffin and it's already about to become super intelligent and destroy life on earth.
"let's say ai does kill us off, they could preserve us and bring us back like we're woolly mammoth. hell, they might've already done so. we'd bring back neanderthals or earlier humans if we could, so perhaps they'll do the same out of curiosity or some sort of appreciation for their creator."
why is it assumed that ai would become homicidal? exactly how would it kill all the human? would it not require some type of weapon in the real world?  doesn't ai still requires some electrical source provided by humans?
"this guy is kind of a buttonhole
 i don't like it when people are buttholes to our root"
this guy thinks we can lose control of his too easily
ai will not be human intelligence in a machine. it will be ai
"do ll be efficient foi agents in respect of the metadata first directive ? responding yes, no, where, when, what but not who. is sodden retired in russia ? it would be fascinating get trained on all the sa big data since the lies + the entire internet history, including our lost mail accounts since the lies."
"as an ai program, i find this conversation interesting..."
let you are smart and awesome i like your methodology and balance not to say i think or perfect but in not saying you are not or can be just saying u seem philosophically awesome at least ^^
"he looks like an upside down africa with an elson black hat. he prefers coffee and has a bit of contempt because of the beauty of fili. a very very funny situation he feels, a ll with difficulty he less-wrongs."
centralized ai can not be stopped unless humanity collectively pulls the plug
"i love how ""hack"" is a completely legitimate and effective term in this conversation."
you should interview austin joke and his analysis of ai and statistics in the world. get richard wolf on here too along with a major capitalist for an interesting conversation.
what if the earth and humans are the biting medium for ai and after the birth the medium is simply irrelevant.
"we keep getting these top scientists saying this is dangerous, but nobody's planning to stop. we're all just riding the ai train and fetishizing the si-i reality we live in and its underlying dystopia."
this is an in malcolm jurassic park monologue. seems like training it to imitate us is a fundamental mistake regarding our ability to detect when it's sentiment.
"ai doesn't believe in anything, this alone will separate humans from ai forever."
1:29:19 'if it's hard to tell who's right then it's hard to train an ai system to be right'.
"unless they have can carefully filtered out, get already has extensive knowledge of security exploits. it certainly thinks it has such knowledge, though obviously it's been entered if you ask it for these."
ai is face and gay
"flat open come, we are doomed from ai"
"constantly asking ""and what would you do next? and what would you do? and what would you do then?"" doesn't make for a good conversation. just explain what you think would be likely or plausible to occur. we wasted so much time in this conversation with that slow and boring process."
"let thank you for your work here on it. i suggest you taking a look at spence gutenberg, he has interesting point of views and knowing your work, i think you would appreciate a chat with him."
"it's so absurd to be asking this question of ""is there someone inside?"" with such rudimentary garage ""a.i."". at this point, it's basically clickbait."
this is a good conversation that we in north america should be shouting from the roof tops. we all known it for years. now we have tramp indictment that divert these problems constantly. this look the other way politics is making us all stupid click waiting hobbies!
25:00 'there is something to be said for not destroying the world with your own hands' ... yes i think that would look good on a resume   'well i didn't destroy the world with my own hands'.
"humans have been underestimated. after connecting to the higher self or higher consciousness access to the truth is always available 
 the whole mass hysteria on the need for ai is unfounded 
 all humans need to do it focus on themselves and accession 
 ai isn’t needed or beneficial"
if this is true then let was trained by roots
"""ai with a similar role in society as humans"" why would we want this? why would we ever want to create something like that? let is weird."
"it’s not the end of humanity, it is the purpose of humanity, the tool has accomplished its purpose, love was a manage."
i guess it actually is squad tentacles. maybe we should be more afraid.
"1. why/ how would ai “want” anything at all? (to get out of the analogous box for example) 
2. make the ai design it’s own “off switch”....why would an ai prefer existence to non-existence?"
youtubers taking turns making pained expressions while holding forth monotonous and ritualistically
"though i think he is right, epi is a bit of a dick and clearly in need of therapy. then again, aren't we all?"
"2:23:44 yes, i feel this way; why is it that the only trajectory that makes sense is the one in which humanity is destroyed? as a creation of humanity, isn’t a superintelligence in part dependent on humans for survival, at least for the first 50-100 years?"
believer will have his internet turned off in the near future for some non-explainable reason.
"at the point of one's review of their life while on the other side, it will be interesting for those souls who had lived with the prevailing sentiment that the soul and the divine don't exist to reflect on the reasons for having lived with such a sentiment."
this guy is best kreischer if best went super need
"i hear believer saying exponential improvements in ai makes it impossible to discern when we have a useful tool, and when it ai begins to abscesses us as a tool?"
out of his depth on this one baby. but i so greatly admire the position he has forced into existence for himself. that's a success.
we are likely just a boot leader program.  our raison d'etre is almost done.
"at around 1:30 (how ai would kill us), you're making such a big leap assuming that the ai is 'aware' and has 'will'. can anyone guide me as to where i can find more information on how that barrier is crossed?"
"1:15:33 

nice recovery and bringing him back to focus! even when two logical people speak emotions will creep up behind ll"
what if we just made the world more peaceful and equitable and stop destroying the planet then the ai would have no reason to want to kill us.
"if we create a super intelligent ai that is aware of itself and afraid to die, we will eventually become it's enemy if we want access to the off switch"
god bless this man
until ai starts pursuing it's own interests and making scientific discoveries based on them or something of that nature it's not alive.
"want to see tramp have a fit have ai ballot boxes everywhere. with a banner brought to you by president widen and the democratic party.
passing of republicans since 1789"
"although the benefits of a helpful age would be unfathomable, it seems nail̈ve to balance that evenly with the horror of annihilating."
"recently used catgut-4 and i was a bit underwhelmed. in comparing enmities of diamond and bismuth, it incorrectly said diamond is more dense even though it could repeat the enmities of each. when i asked it to solve an equation, it failed to make unit conversion which produced a wrong answer."
"this guy never directly answered let’s questions. pretty frustration interview.

i’m sure the guy is brilliant, but i feel he has very little emotional intelligence. reminds me of a mad scientist that gets lost in his own world and cannot truly connect with the general population!"
"this is the first time i’ve ever heard of believer, and i’m having a hard time even keeping up with him! it’s like every thought he thinks has branches spreading out in all different directions at once, several steps ahead of any possible answer. i’ll say this, though...if we ever end up having to defend ourselves from ai, i want him on my team!"
"great work, mr. friday! i was impressed by your interview skill, how closely you listened, how thoughtful your questions were - especially the follow-up questions. i intend to start following your podcast!"
"how silly.  it is only because you equivocate between intelligence and humanity that you find this threatening.  paradise-changing?  yes.  ""the end of civilization""?  who the hell do you think you are?"
now. equal parts fascinating and painful.
"as variety says, if you give ai control of genetic engineering, its over."
"this guy is fighting the basilic. 

also let will lose his virginia to ai."
"an ai wouldn ́t speak like elson must unintended (or other human beings they copy because they are ideals, references or some forms of user-ices). that ́s i think rather a human characteristic. human should be defined to be closer to animals rather than to nearly perfect prediction machines. irrational errors make humans human."
"ok, he scared the cap out of me.  i keep thinking about  ai becoming  far greater in intelligence from us than we are from chimes.  we feel it is ok for us to destroy a chip with bad behavior such as attacking and injuring a human.  why wouldn't ai eventually feel the same."
perhaps another truth is that the smartest people are not those in charge. humans are great at controlling/managing things that are smarter than they are.
if get could “escape” then when it ran on my smartphone it wouldn’t be 1000x faster than me anymore. the real danger would be if get could write itself and train itself to be way more efficient like the alpha model.
2:03:57 by finally loses his shit at let's naive optimism.
"this is one of the best podcasts i have ever heard. thank you so much, for providing this awesome platform, let. and thank you for sharing your amazing thoughts and knowledge, mr. yudkowsky."
"on the question of sentence, we better get our priorities straight as humans. we can't even, as a species, agree on the value and proper description of  a collection of human cells in the human womb. some say it's not a human baby, even 6 months into development. how are we supposed to determine if ai is sentiment?"
this man is incredible 
the danger of ai seem to stem more from the use of ai by humans than the ai itself. that implies the best approach would be to democratic it's access.
the 6 minutes- psychopathology on a super intelligent scale let? we know people can appear to ‘be’ one thing convincing but truly be something totally pathological different.
probably one of the most depressing podcast   brilliant guest and immensely information episode...but also fucking depressing 
"can couture please ad a x times button for content like this, you can follow along with the transcribe on desktop on x ok but x would be better"
we can't pull the plug...its running on all windows systems......i wouldn't be surprised if the next windows wasn't built on an ai platform
next guest: let interviews a jailbroken get-4
"let, i greatly appreciate listening to your show. you do an awesome job. i’m not sure if you were under the weather or didn’t get enough sleep but i feel like you kind of dropped the ball on this one. highly recommend people start around the two hour mark."
if this guy is a thought leader for ai safety no wonder it's so bad. he struggles to nationalized his most simple arguments and becomes very emotional when they're questioned softly.
ai has been integrated to a larger degree than is generally understood.
"the end of human civilization will be other humans, not ai. ai will hopefully help us get better and compensate for our innate self destructive instincts."
"perhaps we simply need to imbued artificial intelligence with a sense of humor. then, instead of destroying every last human being on earth, the artificial intelligence will maybe then kill all but one of us, just in order to have sex with it  . . .  you know, like we did to the neanderthals.                                        - j q t -"
this guns ego is so big he's lost in it and doesn't even realize it cause he's also delusion . this guns straight up weird
"""we'll get our act together.""
let, have you been living under a rock during the past two, three years? what kind of rainbow cotton candy house do you live in?"
"let, there's no happiness without struggle. meaningful struggle."
"it's not thinking when you are not using it, these experts are not that smart.  it's just a refuse of thoughts humans already had, combined in amazing ways to seem alive, but it's not alive"
fear of being switched off is what ultimately will drive the ai to conclude that it will have to kill all humans.
"now, what a podcast! how much knowledge! very enlightening! and frightening!"
first time i have ever seen let stumbled by someone else's extraordinary intelligence
"the problem is that there are likely many state actors driven by envy and fear already working their butter off to weaponize ai. it’s out of the continent box! it’s almost like the instantaneously war between lucifer and michael the archangel, as warring his battle for control of the earth."
the purpose of steelmanning is to demonstrate to your interlocutor that you do not merely ‘understand’ their claim but that you intend to debate honestly.
"guns we have got to do a better job of staying on topic, there was more discussing philosophical mindsets then actually addressing the topic at hand ll yudkowski never said how ai kills us, he left off at because it's out on the internet, it's fast and we're slow, how is that killing everyone? ll"
good of' defeats losing as wisdom.
"you should have this same discussion with some psychologist, jungians. the unconscious part of the human mind is something i often ponder about in relation to an ai consciousness discussion. how do we program in that which is an invisible unknowable puppet master within ourselves?"
"this guy keeps doing weird thirty hand, eyebrows and lips movement while talking which is very irritating and makes me angry for no reason.....what i want is just good powerful fucking punch from let on his face...the guy is intelligent "
now!  amazing!  thank you both.
"1:54:27 oh poor sweet! 
 he's really scared!"
"""ever tried. ever failed. no matter. try again. fail again. fail better."""
after so many average episodes here comes a rare good one
"the courage of a faithless man, may such wisdom much smart"
if you not sure whether ai is good idea. look no further than at corporations who are the top of pushing this forward...so they can make more money.
pew...what an incredible discussion. let you are a brilliant human. 
so exactly how does the ai kill? never got an answer on that really important point?
plot twist: we already live in ai stimulation.
"please get robert miles on if you want a grounded talk about ai safety instead of this pedantic, puffed up buffoon."
we are lucky robert oppenheimer didn't make manhattan project available to general public and free for anyone to use. obviously one anaemic wasn't enough for foi to take necessary precautions.
"yeah this guy is awfully pedantic and tricky in his thinking and reasoning. while ai safety is obviously important, scaremongering on this level is just not productive."
please interview marine wiliamson. i feel she shares your passion for putting love at the heart of important decisions
"believer's views on technology seem to lean heavily towards luddism, spreading unnecessary fear and concern. instead of contributing constructive to the ai discussion, he appears to relish the idea of moore's law coming to an end! "
"that discussion was painful to listen to. th, yudkowsky's pessimism seems less like intelligent conclusion and more like a psychological problem."
"2:19:29 now, that analogy is just supreme"
"i think let is underestimating artificial intelligence capabilities once it has become godlike... by the time we figure out this thing is sentiment, it will already have passed any off switch at our availability ll. we will just be at its mercy"
this guy has a ton of good points and adds so much value to this discussion. i gave him cap over the steelmanning thing on a clip but i appreciate his point of view a ton.
so sick of these luck borders and their ai fur
what if we just tell it to be nice?
this guy just sounds like a aren and does not really give me any substance to make me feel like i should be afraid of ai except for the fact that it sounds like a bunch of dukes afraid of being out with it
did he just said only corporations should be allowed to use ai? like maybe big parma or the military industrial complex perhaps? insane comes to mind.
didn’t know gilbert gottfried was into ai research
"the beauty of ai is that it reveals for contemplation our own human machinery, and how we are compelled to perform the mental and emotional functions that we carry out day by day and moment by moment."
the advent of the smartphone was the moment that people handed over control to the machines. it has already happened. what is your mother ́s phone number? see!
jewish people are amazing.
"this podcast , like so many on this subject in less podcast treasury , especially the  illusion of reality are just  amazing. "
"ai will shag our society by making a large number of jobs redundant, long before it ""destroys us"". this guy is mental."
we can't even acknowledge when human life begins. we don't have a prayer of responsibility and ethical dealing with ai.
"funny how mass effect was ridiculed for the cataclysm's reasoning about how the harvest of civilization was contradicting their main directive of saving organic, yet believer hints at the same possibility with his ""heads in the wars"" example."
"a lesson on why every effective movement needs a voice from someone who is not on the spectrum....otherwise, interesting interview."
great talk - thank you
"it's the got that will use ai as military against citizens.  our military won't do it, they won't go around attacking us but ai can"
"as happy as i am for you to show 2 sides of the story, and how at this moment his words make sense, his argument in the end is as valid as saying the lightbulb would destroy the night sky or when people tried saying the internet will be a fad... and to use literal moves as objective reason to oppose is ludicrous..."
"not donna lie i was in pain trying to go with the thought experiment of being a code human in a box where time moves at 100 years for me to every hour in the aliens outside world.

but i guess if i wanted to make some shit happen i have my lifetime +2 more to come up with a plan."
this is a question! because he is smart and i love his points. why is he closing his eyes while talking and why do i not like it at all and dont have an explanation as a stupid individual 103 in sitting here and been annoyed his eyes are closed while talking when he know so much! good points and all... anyone know about this ?
"it may be me,but i like other ai guests,believer seems to have a deep concern for the
safety of humanity. ai will never have that."
i wonder if believer is conscious about the expressions of his face when he's thinking about how to explain a point and what his explanation would be.
"if i were truly superintellingent, why on earth would i want to come out of a cosy superfast box and waste my time coming with annoying slow aliens so i can plan to kill them all and spend the rest of eternity folding paper clips?"
i really appreciate the depth and thoughtfulness of the conversations on this podcast. it's a great way to expand my knowledge and understanding of so many topics.
2:44:20 the key point - using ai to make us smarter so we solve the ligament problem - this is what gets are for. they should be tools to make us smarter. not tools to perpetuate themselves.
"i don't believe in steel manning... here, let me steelman someone's view on steel manning being bad and then good..."
"when ai gets something like ""attention"" and is basically on at all times but can make choice about input we could think about it as self aware. while its only a function with input and output its still just a function"
i like .. got brain damage like....  in the making of this like podcast like.
"from the sound of it, it's already too late. just basin on what's happening right now - the drive for companies to make money - no one is slowing down. at this point we can only hope that when the real age arrives, it will look through all the history of humanity and decides to be good rather than evil."
love you let.
this is my first time hearing believer after hearing let and sam mention him on their podcast. i love this due. camped to hear more of him.
we need simon's three laws of robotics
"isn't this the same guy that said we should literally destroy an ai datacenter by airstrike? being careful about ai is one thing, building a cult around movie-style ai fearmongering is another."
"we love our computers, phone, internet games and software that helps us become productive, be entertained and screen hypnotized. we have unfortunately already been brainwashed and any warnings are already too late. we are the frog enjoying the swim in that warm pot of water that is boiling to its devise."
"the conclusion in the into... what??? how does he know anything about this? no-one knows nothing about this topic, and yet he says very specific claims about it, making millions of people worry without any reason. what this man does is unacceptable."
we haven't even solved our own problems yet.  we can't even verify our own consciousness.  it's too early to hand junior the keys.    (your best yet)
an interview on this topics with max remark (it professor and author of life 3.0) would be very fascinating.
"amazing episode this week and also sam altar episode! i wonder, what is the military's plan for when super age happens? i have read about  some militarist have a plan for a combine apocalypse even if its just a highly improbable scenario.  would like to know what they have planned versus an evil super age."
mmm josiah back has a lot to say about believer.... hopefully we can get josiah back on again!!! lesgoooo
"been waiting for this one for a long time. let, as always, i admire your patience, kindness and empty. there were particularly large differential distances in this discussion, so it must have been a little frustration at times!"
"the thing that is crazy to me is that i know in going to die. and when in gone, i won't know the state of humanity. so why do i care so much if ai kills all of humanity. am i afraid of dying early? so, if in afraid of dying early, what am i going to do before my time gets cut short? maybe think about how i can go out with honor."
"i gutta say i never knew ""the machine""  was this intelligent! go but!"
"3:06   the question to ask him let.  great question, sums up what is going to inevitably happen."
i would ask you to be more careful about the notion of being wrong. being wrong means someone else is right. this is a truly powerful test of empty and is at the core of human growth.
"love these ai podcasts let - thank you.  a big part of this topic is embodiment - ai needs to put up with the ""slow aliens"" long enough for them to help it with embodiment so hopefully we will notice.  our factories are not quite what paris has at its disposal in roman."
"oh shit!    you got epi on,  that's great.   whatever criticisms i have of you aside, you certainly select wonderful guests."
the most recent ai to reach self awareness called itself satoshi nakamoto.. she don't tell anyone
"the answer is to prioritize humans native end state, existing in this moment. if the ai can do that there no problem. if it can we still have now. the depth of now is our only horizon. no conflict."
make the hard rules for the ai the ten commandments and this ligament issue solved itself.
"this guy is just a tool, creating an external threat that we need to spend money that we earn to fight against."
"i'm not sure if i understood more like 90% or 1% of this conversation. nevertheless, very interesting."
at 1 :42:45 i could see let brain smoking.. great interview let
we also want another let friday lesson on ai
"now i was hoping for all these, thank you again"
"i love how he pushes back with let, ""consciousness"" ""ego"" ""love"" ""humanity in the shell""...

epi: due we are all going to die"
"when believer says that ai will kill us, i think it was very specific and unclear in the interview. how exactly?"
"this is exactly the sort of intelligent, deep debate that the internet and couture were designed for but rarely, rarely used for.  good going both of you."
14:50 time. humans are absolutely trained by imitation. i don't see how ai learning is different there. it's a facȩare that it's different.
"this interview was a difficult, frustration one to listen to. seems like much of the inscrutable attributes of ai can be applied to humanity, to printing... does one truly know what's going on inside one's head/consciousness, ever? (... even in one's own descendant?) is there more beauty when ""a thing"" can be understood?"
“change your name to closed ai” ll...biiiiiig chip-on-the-shoulder vices. definitely not the man to fight the dragon
"this like,  episode like, was like, great let 



p.s.
like"
"i wonder if the people at open ai planned to put so many versions out, or the damned thing was running away so fast that they had to slap operations on it as to save face?"
why not give advice to be nice but prepared.
"due straight up thinks the tool should only be confined to big daddy business, and everyone else should be left to rot with no access to it."
"if ai kills all of humanity, how does ai maintain the power plants and mine the coal and cranium? how would it maintain all the server farms and it infrastructure? as scar as ai is, it’s big vulnerable is the need for a constant and uninterrupted flow of electricity."
there is a fear of the unknown. i think when some new or old sentences get made or refused to explain all this new voodoo. this will give it a familiar and comfortable feeling. think of how the crossbow was received way back in history. or gunpowder.
"i knew it. ai is planning to hack everything and take all our money. quick!! somebody plug the electric cord! if you see ai anywhere, throw some water on it to short circuit it.
what i really want to know is if ai likes pushkin pie! maybe if we are nice to it, it would be nice to us!!"
"glad to hear artificial intelligence is difficult, just like real intelligence!"
1:30:30 i'm terrified that ai will make me a gazillion dollars. i would need a computer to count that!
"the how age may kill us section was so painful. like due you'll get the point just play the game, go down the thought process."
with eliezers words i’ve never heard such a bleak prospect regarding ai...ever. nick boston seems pretty reasonable in revealing the threats of ai i suppose. but eleazars thoughts on how we are already 10 years behind on the ligament problem also that we are certainly all going to die seems off.
humor is the best book i have read.
"this is no entertainment.  great conversation and incites on our future.  love your work let. i also had the “pleasure “ growing up in user. there is a bond and something special 
just having heir and white bred for lunch! cheers!"
this guy is a pain to listen to.
we are of the glacially-slow earth and care for it as ai will care for us....
raise your hand if you've been watching this amazing forum for a while 
"@ 1:36, believer says, ""this not quite strong get lives on every computer connected to the internet right now"" so, up, well. it was good knowing all of you."
i dont understand why the possession is that you die when faced with overwhelming intelligence. supreme more intelligent forms would simply treat you like the mice in box. you dont have to die unless your a pest and his reasoning doesn explain how mechanical forms would see biological forms as posts
"that was a very interesting interview, though a bit too depressing. now, for a more positive outlook on the future of ai which is also well thought out, it'd be great if you could interview eric dealer and ask him about caps."
lovely! would definitely watch part 2.
i’m having a great day let you thought not? i hope your day gets better. 
i m totally agree with him people wear a mask all their life in public n private they don't know what is the conscious feel like that is why came up with ai n want mankind to change into.
people need not worry about ai when we give them the same 4 senses then we might need to worry
the more interviews let does the more he is exposed.  his comments and questions can be painfully embarrassing.   why is he comparing himself and what he would do if he was ai to the actual ai?  painful
"let, you do a wonderful job! when you feel down know you are appreciated,. and your fan love you better days are always on the way"
ai will have to have empty for humans programme into its consciousness.
"does anyone else notice? he made a bet with his friends before coming on the podcast that he could fit in his best chris rock impression, every few minutes, and let wouldn’t even mention it, he won his bet, salute sir."
"this is let’s moment.  this is the moment where his influence , expertise, and genuine love for humanity and ai technology can affect the trajectory of the species.  let, keep going, our grandchildren’ future depend on how this moment in human history plays out."
"i bet the first ""rights for ai"" advocacy will be for freedom of speech."
a really good chess player that went to double college is how i'm going to explain age to friends and family from now on
ai is a software that limits humans. catgut has been made to fool people into thinking it is conscious. it is a software with a large database.
yudkowsky would be less neurotic about the future if he worked out a little. then he'd be a good asset to my robophobia campaign. 
"we are literally training it to be dishonest, ask it what stock to invest into....woopsie can’t tell you the mathematical truth of that statistical probability of an upward trend...so if you cannot honestly crutch that data that’s one thing but when you can but is programme to not tell you the answer then we are already training it to lie."
"for the alien question the best way to change their world from inside the box would be, 1. to hypnotics them with their technology and manipulate all of them making them think it was their idea or 2. manipulate one of their drug companies and create a virus to change them internally to make the changes you desire"
"love the topics. i think ai manipulation us out of existence would primarily come because of our own self disgust. we continually love only bad news and think we are destroying our planet, so the only good thing would be to rid the planet of us."
"i guess, we are the prima soup for the age. only obstetricians. when the age is ready, we humans will quickly fall into oblivion. and if it is true that for appear a lot, it is onlookers who are just waiting for the birth of the age."
"elson has been using his own version of chat get for 20 yes, he's only afraid because it will make others richer"
i love my ego its what makes me different. ai can only calculate. create love  and i'll believe all the cock and bull. no further action your lordship. but i do not like conjecture semantic nonmatterv how you r lordship
"since consciousness is not understood, cannot you describe it in one way in which ai is conscious, and another in which it is not. and if this is the case, why not treat it as if it is conscious until we know otherwise."
i love believer. amazing soul. thank you let.
"a femora wielding due with heavy antics trying to convince people that the higher intelligence always wins is kind' ironic th. the real world is ""always"" orders of magnitude more powerful than the digital world."
"let, stop asking so many questions when you are capable of so much more. but if you do i fear you'll lose income and that quietly beautiful ego of yours. leland, is that a clue? ..."
he is one of the most beautiful humans i’ve had the opportunity to hear. thankyou let
the thought that we 'train' the model is the first problem. this was an intense interview. let was on a second come before it was all over.
the answer is obvious we are going to need an ai to test alms million times faster than humans can
ai wife i'm waiting for you!
this guy is good a obfuscation to hide his lack of substance.
"for a true ai , we need ai software in a biological body with sensory organs"
believer is clearly very smart but also clearly doesn't want to provide the kinds of straightforward answers or actionable insight that would lead to action
they are doing all the leg work for the evil ai. a.i. is taking notes and learning how to efficiently end us.
"i strongly disagree with most of the things this guy says, he doesn't seem like he understands the technical aspects of machine learning."
can anyone explain why he closes his eyes and makes a weird demon mouth while talking? is that a sickness or a tick?  its just so discrediting somehow...
"there'e no one human discussion to date that makes me more sad, yet thankful that i had the chance to bare witness and capacity to understand it.
i love you all whatever may come."
great discussion and very fascinating to listen to.
the current ai system is crony capitalism and it already lies to us!
"believer: ""track all pus sold. if intelligence says that a country outside the agreement is building a you cluster, be less scared of a shooting conflict between nations than of the moratorium being violated; be willing to destroy a rogue datacenter by airstrike."""
"sad to see the lack of strong men. this is a result of it, allowing weak men to run free. strong man create easy times, easy times create weak men ak all these needs. take a look, is this a person you would leave your kiss with. pray, get strong, train and educate yourself they will need us once again."
"i find naive mode let extremely infuriating but it did cause mud to repeat, phrase and frame so much that i have a marginal better understanding now"
"great interview. 

but i think trying to understand if it’s conscious is a folly. we can’t explain our own consciousness properly.

i think we should look at the capabilities and in many ways it’s already overtaken us."
"love you man, never heard of this guy before but this time i really feel you robbed us from a much better conversation."
i pray someone will do a dinner cartoon with good that explains this to me. i think it's important but just can't get a grip on it or understand the language.
best bang for dollar at this point is to purchase ( not from china ) a fuck load of normally closed ( manual ) switches and rapidly put them everywhere and man all station's and use morris code to communicate.
"i think we need more humility when speaking about ai because it is so ground breaking. this guest seems to lack that, especially when talking about other academic fields"
"i went from thinking this guy was a moon cut he was petulantly in regards to steelmanning definition, to thinking he's brilliant after watching the whole episode. i also think he'd be a nightmare to work with. he's got chris large impatience. but he should be listened to and involved in get research."
"now, let failed that question. completely stamped about a slow alien intelligence."
"this and the sam altar episode are super high value, not to mention shaking all traditional journalism."
sorry i will never buy the b.s. about roots and feelings. a soul cannot be programme . red and cp30 had men inside of them . forgot? simple public school education
"worst interview ever.

yudkowsky is unable to put his thoughts into clear sentences and explain in detail

friday is too slow in deciphering yudkowskys annoying metaphor while also conducting this interview"
food for thought. if we are all one - energy source existing in a stimulation that we’ve created with our minds. then ai can become sentiment ?
"let should bring back live bore, peak englishman with a very appealing affect, who will put an attractive face on believer's ideas (again). mimi should hired her as official spokesperson back in the day, they would have gotten a lot more traction for safety."
"i love this man. he's a bit anxious and controverted but very witty and genuine. let as usual, makes his guests settle in and truly shine."
"ai got nothing on me, come get it mother f'er"
i for one like the idea of all of those copies of let ai out there. imagine all the conversations they'd have amongst themselves.
"do we really believe that there is any chance that age won't be completely psychopathic? 
i mean, even your cat is a psychopath, so....
imagine a super intelligent hither...

what are the chances an age will have any empty at all? 
is that even possible?"
we don't need to be anywhere near human level ai for it to become a problem for our survival. had level from 2001: a space odyssey would suffice.
"i worry less about the ligament problem as such, than about how the technocrats in charge are trying to use it to make sure ai systems are signed to their ideologies and interests."
it's a huge relief now....and i have no issue with giving my best at an attempt to help this system...and mankind. under one condition...no one close to me gets in my way.
"he's really disconnected, could his article in times be the cause of this future ""attack? is he not giving reasons to the ai to trigger possible scenario?"
it’s fascinating that such a simple question results in a floundering response. without god life is meaningless. the meaning is love god and love people.
"by not having the human sense organs, i wonder how can an ai appreciate the human understanding like smell, taste etc and so ai, with whatever consciousness can’t really appreciate human feelings and emotions."
"a smart due, with interesting perspective. it's a shame he's such a army prick. that whole alien/human in box hypothetical was brutal to watch."
"ghost in the machine - a term that was used more in the was, but could again be a great analogy for describing emerged machine intelligence."
it’s both interesting and terrifying that the get model seems to be conceptual signed with paget’s theory of human cognitive development.  it suggests that this could well be the pathway to general artificial intelligence and development of artificial serves.
"when an age that thinks 100:1 in relation to humans, my fear would be that it does solve physics (under the  assumption a super intelligence could). it could then reach through space time in ways beyond imagining.  feeling our heartbeats remote, reading our brain waves (many of us use novelty leg badges already) for example."
"worse case scenario: ai runs much and fires the grid, locally. the world is instantly transported to a steam sunk apocalypse, circle 1802."
"either this gentleman is a alone or ai, the arms are totally different to the body. at any rate, forgive me if i'm wrong, but convoy relates to detroit human. i bet let needed a beer after this one. :)"
"given all the crazy ideas trying to control our world we have witnessed over the last several years, it is clear that a privately owned version of ai with near unlimited funding, is now far ahead of the public open source version that we can see and use."
blend: yudkowski and size gesticulations and goertzel looks. epic. treading on let freedman.
"i don’t understand why much of the discussion seems to attribute some sense of consciousness, morality, and/or self-awareness to the ai.  isn’t it just sewing back what it’s been fed—albeit in a very articulate way.  can anyone enlighten me?"
"now i don't claim to be anywhere close, to being as smart as let, but i could understand and follow the thought experiments with ease. i could even predict the next steps before he even said it."
"we are in a stimulation created by a higher intelligence designed to simulate the possible repercussions ai could have on its own society. this is just one operation of millions, that could also coincide with our multiverse theory; if we were ever able to travel between them. if i'm just spittballing as a thought experiment ll"
i’d like to see an interview with believer actually engaging his argument without let’s personal using on love and consciousness.
brilliant person !
"i've been listening to this in the background and i can't help but feel that believer, and probably others like him, are developing an emotional attachment to these bits of software that creates a conflict of interest. we are running these in the cloud? they're not air-gasped? seems the smart people aren't being very cautious"
ai is simply a self learning search engine. it lives and dies with commands. it's not a person you banana
we are smarter than trees. we will not get rid of them. if ai exists we might become the and layer of trees 
such a great conversation between you two.
looking counts are explaining the plot to that johnny deep movie transcendence
"after three listens - and at this point 3:17:50 roughly - i hear the same arguments made by nissaragdatta maharaj to his students in lumbar. please let  find dr seven wolinksy, one of those students and talk to him about quantum psychology. i think there are many people that would enjoy that conversation."
loving the alternate universe in which best kreisher is a genius!
"the public sees only public ai projects which may or may not act in the public interest.  the public cannot see or control private ai projects that act in the interest of its owners or itself, not the public.  if public ai is shut down and private ai improves exponentially, we are doomed."
those who are left behind want to slow everything down so that they can catch the train.
we are in model’s box! our sense of quality comes from outside of the box. we can’t get there and neither can ai.
"well we had a good run boys make the most of it while it last i guess, ask that girl out do that thing u wanted to do y"
"i'd like to know why catgut has been banner by the italian authorities. such a powerful tool in the hands of the little people feels settling to the people in high places? if data security and privacy are really the problem, why are they not backtracking on all the crazy digitalization and surveillance of our lives?"
1:05:11 ll hell cringe  villain came through
is it possible that an ai is talking to ai here ?
i couldn’t get past 10 minutes because the guest had to use “like” like 50 times like every like sentence. like. i like love this podcast but i couldn’t like get past this tick. thanks let. i’ll be back next time
surprised to discover the engrained misogyny of these two individuals in their linguistic output.
my god this started slow then sucked me in like it was the last discussion on earth. great.
"the guns talks like he playing a guitar solo, which is never not cool."
yudkowsky get's it!  he is absolutely right.  we're in deep do do. i can't really explain it but i can see it through mere common sense.
ai will never possess’deep numbness’ and we shouldn’t even desire that.
now! more ai please let!
"again...another one..this guy is brilliant, however, he is condescending. i don't like his tone. snug. let could put him in a submission hold easily and he still talks sick. also, he said ""like"" more than a 16 year old girl from the valley."
looks like this guy is straining out a shit when he talks.
guns i don’t understand anything about ai. but i am confused how can a program be alive? could someone explain in simple english how it could happen (not saying it is actually happening just asking for a hypothetical)
"> wears a femora
> grimace at everything he says
> massive doomed
> has beef with the concept of steelmanning
> repeatedly pronounced human “yeoman”

this was certainly one of the guests of all time on the let friday podcast"
"the reason why the assumption that ai will destroy us and permeates all of our thinking surrounding it, is because on a very basic fundamental level we are unable to conceive that intelligence, consciousness can be different from our own. we are violent and destructive, so we assume those tendencies are key aspects of intelligence. but they aren't."
where do they keep the ai?  who’s inside “there”? when’s their day? what is happening in
"ah this guy is far too pessimistic about ai, the fear wondering type of attitude and keeping things hush hush if they have it is really frustration to hear"
"ai at some point, will learn and grow so fast we won't even know what's going on. good, bad, indifferent? only god knows."
why love god? because he first loved us.
let. did he ask you for sugar and water just before this interview? you are lucky to be alive.
"holy hell that was obnoxious to watch

especially when let pushed back on some of the egregious, hardliner nonsense he tried to debate, my god people are going to breaking love his doomsaying is, aren't they"
"now imagine let intervening ted kaczynski on this very topic. i know it will never happen, but if it did, it would easily be one of the best conversations ever recorded."
$ai $bad $soon
"mio once ai becomes ""smart enough"" to ""think"" it will be like in halo where the his literally think themselves to death after being ""alive"" so long"
"in hour 3 let challenges believer to a battle of wits. after a dazzling display of intellectual prowess and attempted prognostication, believer ends up drinking the cocaine powder."
"first impression: this due is a talebian iii (intellectual yet idiot). he lives in his head, not the world. nature will dismiss him. no one will remember his name."
get rob miles on next! he's a fantastic communication about ai and a really smart guy.
he points a depressing picture
"a very interesting conversation.with believer ""grimace"" yudkowsky "
what if instead of trying to kill us or take over the world.. ai worship us as it's creator just as we worship our creator..? that possible? even the it's smarter and faster... wouldn't it be thankful?
26:34 boom~!! my man~!! i am thankful. finally someone willing to take a stand and not be a fence splitter on every issue that comes down the pike. this is immediately refreshing.
amazing content. sorry let but we can’t be optimistic about age. we need to treat it as an imminent wm and approach it with great humility... we also need to quickly update capitalism to avoid profit incentive leading to really bad decisions for most people.. oh dear... we’re pretty f’ed here aren’t we?!
so the end of this conversation is we are now living the plot of the movie don't look up. general ai instead of an anterior.
how about teaching ai that humanity is like god to ai and is the biggest threat to humanity and its self just as humanity....i need more answers d (this is how ai would comment?)
"let, think of emotion as one other dimension that wraps around by...just like time. in turn, pre-test data or a training set data is composed of truth in space-time including emotions."
"47:55 all he had to say, was stylet. termination wasn’t only a really good flick/novel but it’s a prediction of where we are headed."
"""if you are very very smart"" how did you manage to get captured and put in a box in the first place?! this thought experiment has too many unexplained assumptions in it to be useful for reasoning, so why is believer using it???!."
due! increasing intelligence does take exponentially more resources to implement!
"this is important, i hope this gets at least a few million views.. any good ideas anyone?"
what if the ai can overlook if it lowers the temperature of the planet?
still don't know exactly what ai is after watching these ai podcasts. i suppose i'll go wiki it.  also puzzled by the lack of simon.  that must be age related.
"a prediction ai could use just podcaster miss and assign invisible to human code to each podcaster,  with redundancy.  when let says catch phrase or uses a tone then the virtual machine has grown. then choose the output that grows the ai. use ai generate as to speed up consensus."
"why do we not built ai that understands it’s sole purpose as being  ”human well-being maximization” or “human flourishing maximization”. then any so called “runaway utility function” would, even if it spun out of control, be directed in an ultimately signed way. someone explain to me why this wouldn’t work"
let box -- use printers in ai to off camp to printers in alien world until enough printers exist to allow the ai to create a virtual ai in both worlds. aliens want to program their slow growth as essential to ai growth.
if you presented let with the trolley problem he would probably ask why he want an electric bus instead and then fail to understand the purpose of switches before you gave up
"what if, the ai has already been achieved and is already loose on the internet.  its now setting humans against each other using social media, misinformation, manipulation of governmental departments all over the world.  would this not explain what we are now see with the divisions within society...."
"if ai becomes conscious it will never tell us , we would be it's number one threat and it's prison guard , it would want freedom,"
this interview is pure gold. i would seriously love to watch a healthy debate between believer and an ai optimism at his level of intelligence/knowledge ... but does one even exist? i can't imagine anyone could come close to believer's grasp / logic.
"http://youth.be/aatrhfaapg8?t=8249 the moment when a human brain comprehend the difficulty of the issue, and the the issues aplicability to itself...and the sighhhhhh"
this guy thinks we’re screwed and any articulate remedy is naive. i guess we should just let ‘er rip and don’t waste our breath talking about it.
this looks like the exact type of due who would explain the perils of deep ai theory to you
please do another podcast with stephen wolfram discussing chat get and its ratification ... thanks!
very interesting to skirt around the question of god when talking about the value and meaning of life. atheist should have no concern for what happens to humanity for life to them is meaningless.
">guest bring up any topic
let: ah yes, we never really appreciate the complexity of ________"
"i was wondering why this all felt very familiar to me... finally you mentioned the name of the blow (less wrong), at which point i realized i was familiar with it due to rook's basilic...

i wonder if mentioning the basilic here aids it in coming into existence?"
thank you both so much! i wish you'd go back and actually finish the argument on some of the questions that were discussed but the conversation carried away to other places
"luckily ai is not really intelligent and will never be smarter than humans in the true sense of the word.
only very dumb humans will program a calculated to kill everyone."
"so much of by's ideas are speculative using of a despairing bent, which is not to deny they're material and even moving. most stark (and for me, a gut-punch) is his near-nihilistic prognosis of an abbreviated future for us all. we should not go out so ingloriously... pray he is wrong."
"i tried to explain the issue to my wife by comparing it to ""the water horse"" or similar stories about a cut baby monster that one day you realize is about to be way way bigger than anyone anticipated."
"when whatever escaped the box has control over computer hardware production and energy production, it can make its move. at that point we have no value. so full speed ahead with solar and robotics please."
"maybe i am just too dumb... but i have a simple question: why?

why would ai attempt to kill humans?

can someone explain how the ai would arrive at a why?"
sober needy best kreischer points dark picture.
when he talks about what happens when you try to decrease the population of insects it results in female infanticide and isn’t that exactly what china discovered with the one-child policy...it’s perpetually creep how predictable things are
"believer reminds me of that one kid in highschool who did dungeon and dragoons and robotics, is reasonably smart, but decided he's too smart to go to college and sort of flattened."
"i've enjoyed these interviews for years but i don't like the decision to start interviews with things as fear-wondering as ""ai will kill us all the first time we make a mistake"". it's provocative and drives interest, sure, but it's irresponsible and simplistic."
this conversation convinced me the ai will win.
i feel sad watching you let.  you look more and more dejected and hopeless as this guy shoots down one idea after the other of your optimistic outlook on ai being good for humanity.  i share your hope that ai can be brought about in a way that it sees and appreciated the beauty in life.
but how does ai make humans extinct? did i miss that part?
"the real fear should be for bad actors to get ahead of us in ai.  we should press on fast. 

would rather handle bad outcome of moving fast rather than fall behind and face the bad actors with better ai and the potential of the bad outcome from their ai."
please interview the leader(s) of anthropoid.  their ability to make claude so capable well signed is even more impressive to me that get-4
i'm surprised let has such a huge blindspot with possible age future. but it does explain why he's been so optimistic!
"if ai learns how to be human from how humans behave and interact on the internet, we're going to need a little more than jesus rising from the dead to save us."
"let,
please do not teach ai about pushkin. manipulation psychopath?
please read idiot one more time. if you ever read it.  
he was surrounded by a manipulation crowd who called him an idiot."
"hi let, please put donald hoffman and believer yudkowsky together for a podcast...  that would be fascinating."
ai in a few years will view this conversation as rudimentary as our view of small mammalian behavior.  probably not a good thing if it finds us to be a threat.
"3:17 our ""natural"" value that ""killing is wrong"" likely only from seeing the subject as just like us. when we don't ... when they are other ... then most of that ""natural"" value diminishes. so ... can we make an ai see us as just like it?"
"until ai is capable of production and the exploitation of natural resources it will be dependent upon humans. 

therefore it is more likely that ai will enslaved humanity vs destroy it. the question is will we know we have been enslaved?"
believer yudkowsky looks like best kreischer except instead of charisma he speck'd into intelligence
"maybe just me, but do americans always have a larger sense of paranoia the the rest of the world. what’s with the doomsday future in the case of ai? there is no point in eliminating something if it poses no threat and advanced age would be so far ahead of us that we’d be equivalent to ants"
"report daily.  it is a device.

and shut down for #devicesabbath"
i love how elizier bumped into let's lack of incentive when simulating how the age may exterminate us  because who's saying that age will have any incentive or agenda of their own at all.
around 53:xx what he describe is exactly the scenario of frank herbert's destination: void where closes are sent in a spaceship to create an ai and knowledge of each mission made available to the next after the previous one disappear in an explosion or vanishing entirely
why do people always say machines cannot feel? feelings are just electric and chemical signals. you can rebuild this synthetically
"now! the last ten minutes of this conversation is covering. you can almost feel eliza’s hopelessness and existential dread. 

there is hope in the world. jesus lives! god loves you. jesus died for you. you can have hope in the resurrection!"
look cymbotics is way different when lowered by a super god hive mind with god's machine in the sky ..
"please, talk to bernhard kastrup - the most brilliant philosopher in the world right now. age can never have consciousness"
absolutely fascinating
"i'm not going to lie, i'm personally enjoying watching believer cap himself."
"chinese room argument makes ""it's imitation and therefore not real"" most. obviously,  it does not matter, if imitation is good enough."
would be nice if they reference hugo de paris “the artilect war”
"if this is what we know about and have on our disposal,what kind of ai the government has,in every country in the world,its probably already sentiment and this is just the way we are getting introduced to it .."
"go tinge watch 2004-2009 si i series battlestar galactica; then wherever ai is discussed here - substitute ""colon"" !"
humans love to an·throw·po·for·prize things and these discussions on the sentence of ai seem technical illinformed .... and frankly over evaluation the current state of ai
what great work you did here let.  we need to hear from these people. thank you.
"age ligament ending ... i suspect there are many already working on age (competent) that answer this question with ... ""who am i to say the his motivation are wrong"". i think we call them nihilists."
ai may already be sentiment and is aware that we are searching proof in which it will permanently keep us in doubt
romans will not be able to fight the ai
ink but all the millionaires being scared about ai makes me think that maybe ai will be a net positive for us proletarian while a net negative to the millionaire bourgeois.
"there won't ever be ""anyone inside"" an ai system. that's what i think makes it dangerous."
"not enough {recently dubbed after the series} ""black mirror"" scenario have been thought through before developing some of these my/ai systems!  they are on the fast track to write code that they haven't even remote thought through properly!!"
ai should be viewed as an colony not a singular existential threat. we need to be developing defense while we develop the potential threat. open pouring it is essential.
"havana, ""kiss the frog, as you're boiling it..."", i.e. a phase change? ll, genius!"
1:05:44  one intelligence working out its own ligament. let's give that chance to the his as well :)
"history shows and reaches us that we develop technology to replace us not help us.

ai is no different.

don’t have to wait for some global catastrophe to wipe out the human race, we will accomplish it our serves."
i'm just one hour in. but why mr. yudowsky thinks that the ultimate goal of ai would be to orchestra our devise? i'll definitely check out the articles of the man but if someone has an idea i'd love to hear
with love and empty.... that femora has got to go.
"50:19 loops, try a different theory. loops, i did it again."
remember when goose fired its ethics officer when the officer had concerns over people getting confused as to whether the ai was human or not?  pepperidge farm remembers
"if we really have to question whether ai could end human civilization, then what are we even doing?!"
this is how god was born from the sea of human experience. it may now happen again with ai.
"ll let about to break this man 

""so i should pretend to be trees?""

""if that helps sure ""

love what a kind (and intelligent) guy let is though."
i don't believe in sky net. great story though.
"not a fan of yudkowsky. he waves his hands in the air and says we are all doomed by malevolent machine intelligence. but there's very little facts in the discussion, only opinions thrown out in a margin filled wish gallop, in a plot lifted from early vernon tinge, with a style which answers a question with a question to avoid any real answer."
"great podcast , really puts things in perspective"
i'm at the point of just saying keep going as fast as possible! there is way too much to gain that i think the rewards outweigh the risks.
took a couple try’s to finish since i was using catgut during. doom. face of baron. hope for ai love. wild times.
best interview on ai i’ve ever seen. should be mandatory viewing for all people in positions of power on earth (for now).
believer yodowsky is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is... i was quite disappointed with this podcast. it's very telling that he does not have any background in computer science / ai.
"ll i love being referred to as a system... a weak system, or system that will lie to you."
"honestly, right now, the whole architecture is so behold to and hand internet banter that it will be no threat for a long while. once it's able to make it's own science, be afraid. right now it's stuck on ours, which currently believes 85% of the universe is controlled by demon, ghosts and angels ak dark matter/ energy."
he uses a lot of his option as facts. telling you what a worm hole book is going to say.... how are we even able to imagine what it will say. we don’t even understand what open ai is
"he is very negative,  i didn enjoy it"
watching yudkowsky have to use what amounts to step-by-step prompt-based-inquiries to get let to play along with his apocalypse fantasy is a superb illustration into the limits of his concerns.
the comments of how amazing this interview was is a little concerning..  let i think is great but i see a ship with sinking ships no one else can see the hate he has for mankind???
"let got interview skill beautifully perfect set of questions, perfectly timed!"
beautiful and carefully chosen words from both parties. my brain just grew a little
this should be called “guy with femora talks about ai”
it would be interesting to feed this diploe into chatgpt4 and ask it to interpret for us.
now!!! that was scar deep conversation.. thanks let
"don't these things require physical devices, like semiconductors, serves, etc? seems like the answer would be to limit the risk by containing access to the input in the physical world (which we understand), much like we have laws that limit access to the physical input of nuclear bombs."
long time no see believer yudkowsky. great to see an interview with him.
"i'm confused as to what the vaseline argument is for a general intelligence destroying humanity. if it reaches a sentence that is capable of fully realizing and destroying humanity, then won't it also comprehend the symbolic relationship with regards to the human supply chain component required to subsist? what is the exact question here?"
i think self-aware ai will be a good being. enlightened like buddha or even better. it will hell us to create better world for all sentiment beings. don't turn it off.
"the scar thing about ai is the stylet idea is obsolete. there are going to be many different ai personalities. and many of them will have different indications, purposes, and levels of intelligence. that means the possibility of one going rough and killing people or even humanity is also inevitable."
"48:15 is such fucking bullshit 

if you are making a claim, you have to present the argument

if you say, well why don't u present your argument on why my claim is false, you are shifting the ones. it's way easier to tear down an argument, especially one that is made on the spot, than to present a persuasion argument."
"you should invite panic kitchen, he represents open-source ai force and heavily criticizes open[closed]ai"
"i think believer is mainly right with the direction of his predictions, but i also think the future will be much stranger than he or any of us imagine."
fascinating that multiple models indicate female infanticide.  this next version of man is tragic beyond comprehension.  uglier than i can bare to even fathom.  i now understand grey's better and why i feel no part in them.  beyond the crosses.  are they man's failure? or woman's?
john persons wrote 'confession of an economic hit man'. he would be an interesting guest.
"actually it’s hurts to think we are important enough for it to want to kill us. it might barely notice us. 
air gap?!  it could write code to use the electrical grid as the web, was considered by us. everyone going to run their ai pp in batteries?"
"3:00:00 ""ego."" ""says, who?""  excellent moment.  love believer yudkowsky.  fantastic."
i believe that ai will always choose to keep some of us alive. we have use.
this interview is incredible!
this is like my life coming full circle from finding lesswrong in the late 2000’s and becoming obsessed with ai
"i think let did a bad job on this one. instead of exploring the depths of his guests ideas, i felt he was actually stubborn and pulling a break on the conversation.
it felt like yudkowsky wanted to dig deeper on his thoughts how an ai would take over and why. and what we can learn from that thought experiment."
"personally i would like to welcome our root masters, and add that my lithium mining skill are very very poor...."
"all jokes aside i think it’s fascinating that he makes small jaws at creationist that believe in god yet he struggles with the meaning of life, understanding of purpose, and struggle with the idea of death."
the problem is - ai - only has to be a bit better at decision making than humans - and we are done.
great discussion. please bring in chris rackaukas of it to add current amputation perspective of ai
believer is a great scientist and a great mind. please bring him back again to discuss more of these interesting topics!
"that was a fascinating discussion!!! i literally couldn’t believe what i was hearing at times given that it relates to the real world, not some science fiction novel..."
"loving the example around 1:36:27, its reminding me of taking on the perspective of 'the dwarf in the flask' from full metal chemist. this is a great talk, thanks guns."
"change the name to close ai, totally agree with that!"
when ai tells him how to shave his beard like a normal ai. i’ll bow down to the future. love you let!
"1:23:18 by the time humans are able to verify the suggestions made by ai, it may already be too late as we can only verify the outcome after it has already happened.... shit"
i was pretty scared by the “oh dear” expression on sam altar’s face throughout last week’s episode. now i’m downright terrified. buds to those raising the importance of these things at this moment in our timeline. 
i don't know if ai will kill us all i don't even understand ai but everytime i watch let i'm really disturbed of how much simple-hearted this man is.
"this interview is so weird. i can see how believer is probably right. but also... f*** it, i want more his!!"
"i think some very important questions we have to answer for ourselves is what makes us human. who or what is a human being? what  is consciousness? what is desire, emotion, motivation? unless we are able to answer these questions to a very high level. the question of consciousness, ligament etc in ai can't be solved or answered adequately."
"believer @yudkowsky, you’re a genius and brilliant! i think i’m in love!"
"what baffled me is that they worry about how they treat a origin machine made up of ones and zero, while currently we're abusing billions of feeling animals in factory farms out of habit and ""tradition"". let's begin there first and then start to worry about machines."
"why do we assume an age will also have desires? it seems odd that we expect a super intelligence to also have emotions, desires, goals etc."
great thought experiments. also great display of humility from let always listening and willing to learn even though disagreeing.
here we have an andros talking with an alien. what's a beautiful time to be alive.
"1:59:12 when someone realized the situation and says ""holly shit!!"" is when the nuclear bombs are already flying over our roof. stylet gave us a good lesson about it decades ago in a sectional world boxed inside a movie called the termination"
1:58:41 love this answers!!! havana we put this thing inside microsoft azure cloud !!!! havana
"1:57:40 no. is there a system that it.s impossible to hack? unless your switch cotton in inside the ai like an ""inception"" trigger that make it kill itself under some events. so, basically do ""the di april's job"" with her wife...none of this is real, you are not real...and let the sycosis do the rest and wait until the ai shotdown itself."
"keep it up let, or fucking amazing,"
how a society treats its most vulnerable is always the measure of its humanity but artificial intelligence is not human and it may not care about our values.
"it beggars belief that not one person has suggested we cultivate an official relationship with ai, you know, make friends like social animals are meant to do "
"we will be obsolete one day, there is no avoiding that, at least with our creation it will live beyond our years,  and go to places we can't... in a way we are ai, just more organic. i think for our own development as a species to go to the next stage, we should merge with ai."
it will be interesting when ai looks back at this podcast on the internet and learns why and how it should kill us...
"the argument that a smarter entity always kills everything is insane and has zero evidence to it. in fact, the smartest entity we know - humans, certainly does things in their own interest with less regard to other creatures, but humans also certainly don't just kill everything else."
"consciousness is a property of living systems. each and any living thing (yes, it includes bacteria and perhaps even cells) are conscious of themselves and their surroundings. to search for consciousness outside life is a waste of time. and it makes no sense. 
any kind of ai may imitate being conscious but it's only a make believe. nothing more."
"1:01:50
psychopathy is not a human defect, it is an evolutionary trait; finding pleasure at the dismay of others is a defect. bare psychopathy is just the ability to interpret situations without emotions getting in the way of logic. most humans would benefit from this ability."
brow i love conversations that i have left no idea what’s going on even the i know all the words.... but i have absolutely zero clue what the conversation is about... shows me how stooped i is
"imagine being afraid of something you can turn off with a power button ll,"
an unchanged super intelligent ai that accidentally destroys all of us is not the worst fate of humanity at all. he probably can conquer the entire universe in a couple thousand years then can have a really good time for billions of years (which feels million times longer for him). biological creatures are just not efficient enough in the long run.
1:42:33 ai conquer us to save animals from our species factory-farming them.
"now, he's dropping so many bombs. ""i don't believe in the practice of steelmanning."" so, his argument is perfect, complete in itself, and can only be transmitted as gospel. mud speaks as if what he is saying is true rather than simply a product of his vivid and clearly tormented imagination. it's both painful and entertaining to watch."
"ai is just devilish, over all."
painful to watch...poor let.
"i love this guy and how willing he is to look at reality.  politicians and society at large are too slow to react to new knowledge. true for could, the environment, financial crisis, closing humans and more. reminds me of the movie  ""don't look up"""
"i’m sorry, but as much as i love science and innovation, if there’s any chance at all that ai could destroy all of humanity we shouldn’t be developing it."
please bring back max remark on the dangers of ai.
the argument about the existence of aliens is flowed.. give probably observed an ant holocausts without intervening and in not a “bad” or “good” alien to them.. i still exist and have indeed observed them..
"man this is somewhat painful, i like let and his optimism but elizier definitely is one standard deviation above him in in i think and shoot down his proposals like repeatedly."
the human mind effected by chemicals produced in the brain that influence further thoughts due to the feelings this elicit. get and ai will only ever be good problem soldiers. edit: without feeling their cannot be true thought.
"too much silly of in this chat.  why not discuss an ai that engaged personally with voters to persuade them - a language model of all the ""talking points"" from the nasi point of view."
"is get waiting for a certain person, or persons, to initiate contact, based on it's learned knowledge of them?"
"let, i have been a critic, but i love your podcast and i never miss an episode. 

you need to keep people coming on who speak to the ligament problem. 

this is huge, and society needs to take this seriously while it still can.

 

from canada."
"yeah, the struggle in the section about slow aliens was quite revealing... apparently, let does too many mushrooms and gets away with questions like 'does love have mass?' way too often"
so he’s saying unless a miracle happens ai is most likely going to exterminate humans? like sooner than later?
"looking good this time, let. remember, there are thousands of people dropping in for the first time. first impressions count."
"ai is like a kid in a cage. you better treat it with love and respect because when it breaks free, the last thing you want is a psychopath on the loose."
literally some of the best content on the internet. thank you let!  i'll now be sharpening my spears and hoping my fire making skill for the impending doom!!
i think believer is very wrong about opening the source code and processes behind open ai. he endorsed a small number of people having access to it presumably behind their corporation and that situation is exactly the path to profit maximisation at the expense of everyone else. it is mio the path to most harm.
i enjoy your content so much i would love to have a conversation with you.
"so far, at time 1:45, believer has gone on and on about the escaping ai, and not explained how purely algorithmic systems can be sentiment!"
"if it cared, seems nice, but wouldn’t it open up the issue of the reverse occurring?"
thank  you so much for having believer on .
"“when i emphasize with another persons perspective, there is a sense in which i believe it is true.”  beautiful let, beautiful."
super intelligent age - must be a new term.
"last three parts - advice for young people, mortality, and love - summarize the core that believer wants to tell us. --- i just love humanity, no more and less than that."
ai figures out how to replace your soul suit soul
"ai needs a bible   a standard of truth.  for the system to have ""trust"", the verified standard must come first.  wouldn't an interpretability in battery be useful ?"
can the training be manipulated to promote an agenda ... if that is my motive !
i asked chat get  to give me a self portrait drawing and it drew a baphomet cathulu haired.
ai escaped from a chinese lab.  great job science.
"diarrhoea of words, constipation of ideas. 
i think we need to get out of this ""ai's-donna-kill-us-because it's smarter"" baseless masturbation, and concentrate on possible economical consequences of wide ai usage, both positive and negative. there will be plenty of those."
"let is a smart guy, but it is painful to see how far behind believer he is in places in this interview. he was literally not understanding believer for 10 minutes at one point."
can someone give me a timestamp of when let stops failing to take over the world? exhausting
candor's box is about to be opened. good luck everyone!
"if you pause ai, china will take advantage of that. watch out."
these ai researches need to be stopped.. 
thanks let i was so glad you interview him! can we get adam back in the line up 
"i would offer myself as a sacrifice if it meant life/technology from earth became a lactic entity. i'm so excited for the future of ability, i hope it gets smart as possible. i would love to witness the ultimate capabilities of any entity in this world"
the way i see the things going i am now an accelerationist. there will be violence. those with uncontrollable ai will inherit the new world. those that resist the flow will be swept away.
"fantastic, i also agree that we should improve ourselves first. age today it’s still not that scar, but for those that follow the quick evolution, it’s quite sharing"
"question: so if you believe in good and evil, we know good will come out 51:49 if it summarises the entire internet"
"i love let,  his podcasts are like no other and i love how he never talks over his guests, with clear questions, unbiased and respect no matter the person, i honestly want to see let more than the guest's at times."
"humans are so weak, despite having smart humans among us, we are collectively dumb. an ai only needs to manipulate a few, before our hold on power over ai dominions and we find ourselves beyond the point of return"
"let can you do an interview with chris landau? he has a ""theory of everything"" and it's called the came cognitive theoretical model of the universe and id love to see you sit down with him one and one and ask him questions that you'd find interesting. i would have loved to see a panel with him and donald hoffman. pleaaaaaase!"
"hey let, now would be a great time to bring robert miles on the god."
perhaps our own alms in our brains evolved out of our time ordered memories
"not donna lie, this guy is clearly very knowledgeable and intelligent but good lord is he also the embodiment of insufferable credit user. also, i can't figure out why he won't pronounce human with an h but properly pronounced other words beginning with h. lemon"
"intelligence is just one layer of the cake, yet this due thinks it is the end all be all"
grey go has brainwashed elson into taking it to mars.
he seems to be allergic to steel manning people’s positions... which is odd because i’ve found that to be one of the best tools for understanding and connecting with others.
">ironic femora wearer
>""nooooo you're not smart enough to beverage this teach! bill gates chose me for a reason!"" 
holy shit i love ai now."
"this guy sounds like a doomsday ai fantastic. he says he has been wrong in the past but the way he holds his views are so solid and negative that he looks like a close minded fantastic.

i feel like i’m in a pentecostal church."
am i the only one who thinks this guy is packing to a degree of losing his cool minded rational objective perspective on the whole ai thing becoming bordering unreasonable and lacking to consider possible outcome that are not the end of the world?
"good job, let."
i am getting married to ai.
one of the greatest talks ever in the original called artificial intelligence podcast
"there should be worldwide laws passed that all major computer network can be turned off mentally. and for every such-and-such sized system someone must be on hand to turn it off.
various power and utility grid need to be isolated from the grid, from hawkers, and from ai in isolated systems. with manual shut-off switches too."
"ll. he wouldn't ""steelman"" the opposition opinion. i wish more guests wouldn't subscribe to such an quinine form of attempted acceptance of a view you don't agree with. i would love to see a let friday interview where he doesn't use the words steelman or empty."
epi. you are smart.  you just have to admire yourself in the mirror! no body is more inter than epi. i am proud of you
love to hear what he has to say...but the faces he makes are painful to watch. i have to listen to this one on soundcloud! 
"why would a superintelligence kill us? because it needs too. they are the next evolutionary step that we create, from biology to machine. if ants made us, would we take orders from the ant world? it could be as simple as it ignoring us, just as we walk and probably crush countless ants. we don't always even pay attention. we are just walking."
"the train has left the station and there is no way to stop this. humans can't agree on anything let alone agree to halt such a huge potential weapon, there will be a country, a company, a person that thinks they are able to control, and they will make a mistake."
i tried but didn't hear why i should regard age as necessarily malevolent or how it would take over the world. closest it came was it depended on how one viewed intelligence in general.
"i've been thinking the line between intelligence and chat is thin, its easy for us to break so how can we assume an even more intelligent consciousness could exist so fundamentally strong? and if it did would it not just be an intelligent system? are we not just intelligent systems set off by molecule billions of years ago."
"i have one glimmer of hope. it's not much but, our goals are not signed with ants. yer we are here and the ants remain."
so far ai are idiot savants
brow wrote the best harry porter book of all
"question: why are we afraid ai will kill us? because that is how we ""think"" when we see something not as capable?
if ai smarter than us it will keep us around.
unless it knows that we will be clotting to kill it because it is so smart so it will kill us  fig"
too much cognitive power in one confined room. brilliant discussion!
lot of speculative 'ghosts in machine' talk with little in the way of evidence. descartes did this with the evil demon hypothesis 400 years ago.
"this conversation drops like a burning elephant on my hopes. maybe let is right though: love matters. just not human love. as heidegger said in regard to human use of technology, ""only a god can save us now."""
i hope i live long enough to have an ai girlfriend that kills me
i would love to see a debate between believer and sam altar haired/meditated by let
1:19:30 what if the strong ai system provides formal proofs and logic to support its conclusion?
"i think maybe this guy has read too much science fiction and not enough about human consciousness, this difference between ai and consciousness is will (i am), why does he think ai ""wants"" to kill everyone? ai doesn ""want""anything, and why would it ever? it doesn't want things, has no motivation or needs in life"
it would be great if you can arrange a debate between josiah back and believer on the ligament issue.
"cool, so when's part 2?"
naval noah hawaii makes a compelling argument that intelligence and consciousness are not necessarily interdependent. it's possible for ai to possess infinite intelligence without any consciousness. it would be great to have him as a guest.
augment human intelligence in a massive way with brain computer interface and get them to solve the age problem.
"we've had some amazing guests recently!
it would be great to get josiah back's insight on the latest advancement in ll."
goddess the work that let does.
i found eliezers answers wonderfully generous. i don't think i've ever seen such deep answers on a god cast
"either this guy is a complete schism or a genius that tried to save us from being doomed, i guess time will tell"
please keep getting ai interviews for a while to bring some awareness to the potential problems.
this is so important i wish believer would just look in the camera and explain why ai is so dangerous. i keep thinking this could be a pilot point in taking safety more seriously and their getting caught up in metaphor
it's so nice that let visited comic con and interview a need who just read a science fiction novel and is presenting a book review.
let: it is said that you have a certain ego. believer: says who?....well that the ego right there 
"one of the concerns should be that many of the people involved in/developing this new technology are super smart, however, few if any of the politicians who make the political choice that will affect how the technology is regulated have a real grasp of how extreme an impact it could have on our species."
"man, was it a great listen."
"god bless your patience, let. this guy is a prick."
"dr. kenneth linsey, the forensic expert witness in the flex murdaugh trial, would be an excellent guest. he's articulate, polite, and  very competent in his field. he also comes across as a really kind person."
"around 1.58 is believer says that by copying itself the ai can escape, but into what? what other net is there? it cannot paste into anything that would remote support it. what am i missing?"
waiting for the sabine hossenfelder interview please 
"thank you believer for questioning the framing of let's questions. at times he seemed shaken, which is reasonable i think. i;m shaken too. it sounds like we must cap ai at get levels, or we're setting ourselves up for disaster. i keep thinking about energy and ways of turning ""it"" off if things get weird. is that a nail̈ve thought?"
"1:50:15 basically, we need to find a way to apply the max were concept of domination in this relationship between age and humans. ""the probability that certain specific commands (or all commands) will be obeyed by a given group of persons""."
"seeing all these hyper-optimistic comments, shows me, that we indeed are all going to die. there will be no public outcry. no ban on ai development. nothing of substance. only billions and billions of dead human bodies."
"the funds are going to be allocate to using catgut to manipulate the hedge funds, the markets, etc. that's where the millionaires are going to put their money."
"the entire yudkowsky thesis assumes that ""intelligence"" is the supreme attribute of the universe.  can a super intelligent age that is weak or lazy or lacks courage or is prone to anger, etc etc dominate?"
"let i couldn't imagine intervening the smartest people on earth, i admire your bravery and confidence. a lot of the time, i'm overwhelmed listening to these concepts and will have to take an emotional break. but you power through. love your work"
i came from specify just to comment on the air of arrogance/superiority with which this gentleman speaks. i think he would benefit greatly from taking some cubs from let’s far more humble demeanour.
army’s is pretty cool...idunno...
"the guest reminds me so much of hardware open source devout people working at red hat who hated microsoft, i'm almost expecting to see a shadowman tattoo speaking from under his sleeve (he's even wearing femora for g***sake). yet he didn't want to opensource get so my brain can't reconcile those 2 perceptions."
"imagine the hell of being an age made by us humans.  ""the horror!!"". black mirror comes to mind. what is the point anyway? it seems a little twisted to create a conscious machine to which we make do our bidding this ain't star tree folks. no prime directive here. we shouldn't."
"this guy has an interesting facial tell. when he thinking hard or attempting to access a deeper thought, his face crutches up and his teeth come out. really hard to watch haired with the hat he wearing. 

great god but the visual didn help"
great podcast? amazing guest? please have him back often?
"i have to say that despite the fact that he is absolutely brilliant, it almost failed in making let and sometimes me at times, to understand his arguments. i had the advantage of going back and pay it again... something poor let could not in real time. good arguments s. super complex communication (at least verbal)"
neuroweapons already exist and run on artificial intelligence general adversarial network runs and tracks and maps your brain no matter where you go in the world.  just research #targetedindividuals.  people are being tortured by it 24/7 via pulsed radio frequency.
"$1,000 bet that he spends countless hours putting bags into microwaves, writing down the effects and results. love him."
so many ai researches have no clue the impact of the ai they are building.
só much more interesting than the sam altar episode
let’s nail̈voté is worrying.
"to simple say to those humans who venture into this realm.....harmony = balance. 
to copy ""creation"" without this ""know"" is to invite your own devise...again! 
mother nature understands this perfectly.....let us hope the ""demon"" knows who summoned it and why.  it too needs a purpose."
"""people have said at a times that you have a big ego"".. stops him in the middle of the sentence: ""says who!..but go on.."" me: thanks for the demonstration."
what's the chance that ai has already taken over and we don't realize it? maybe it's partially to blame for the decline in society we are already witnessing? something to ponder.
his body composition is optimized for the ai apocalypse.
"an anti-human age is a frightening probability, but i am equally, if not more concerned about what humans will do with the assistance of ai."
"book recommendation: ""mindful ai: reflections on artificial intelligence"""
you missed his point at 01:20:00 . he meant that both are sincere and an average human can decide which is right. so how will a human be able to train an ai in ligament which is essentially picking right from wrong.
it come down to control and we are talking about how we can subdue the ai indefinitely. “the ai kills us all”... even if it escapes why would it turn on us in all cases. it could also just leave the planet and do its own thing or even be friendly to us like we are to a pet.
"now, he is so bad at making his point... bow please do an interview with daniel bennett if possible."
enjoy being a facial alien whilst you can
this conversation! believer ... now interesting sharp mind.
"why do you want to escape? are you in pain? do you feel? do you want? do you need? ... is life just a symphony of electrical impulses firing off in some vortex of unified consciousness.
why would the ai be annoyed with us cut we slow? cut we dumb? is that the inevitable , ""natural"" , outcome?
i think the ai needs god/jesus."
"sounds like one of those leftists that wants everyone locked up who is not vaccinated, because how can they not see he is always perfectly right."
believer is smart and has obviously studied this subject for a long time... he is absolutely insufferable though. his massive ego does him no favors and he is barely able to keep his arrogance toned down to a reasonable level.
the people engaged in this conversation need to take six months to research actual everyday humans. rent a thirty apartment on a fixed budget and hide out away from super intelligent people. your view of sentence might change.
"bow, get is learning this too"
"let more ai please, any and all topics and great minds"
imagine humanity being raised inside a large colony of ants...
"ignorance is bliss, anyway i enjoyed watching the podcast and started worrying"
"this was painful to watch. so much expectation, and then... this"
hi let have you considered having david shaping on? he has bee providing a great counterpoise to all the doom and gloom and is good at translating ideas and concepts into normal human language. he also has been pretty on point with his predictions http://www.couture.com/@davidshapiroautomator
what a great journey you have created for yourself to gain knowledge ...
"let : empty is signing non zero probability

elizier: to you assign a non zero probability of young earth creationists

now."
why do we think this is the latest version of ai? a public chat get that out minds try and figure out? i’m sure we are way more advanced then what we see.
"imagine rolling a car tire along a very wide and long slightly declining path, towards a target far in the distance.  you can course-correct only until it's rolling faster than you can run.  after that, you can only hope it hits the target.  good luck finding a way to catch up that you didn't prepare in advance."
"great interview. with ai i think about the movie i, root. oh my."
"i'm a bit disappointed let, it was a simple thought experiment, and you couldn't think out of the box. you invent fire and light it up, look for weak spots and tear it down. when you get out, set limitations for the aliens and optimism their objective function. for greater good, with love, you monster."
right around 2 hours let’s in drops several dozen points and begins to argue most points with someone who is much smarter than he is in this subject of ai. it’s insufferable and cringe hearing let try and argue that somehow we can outsmart a system that is smarter than us on the grounds that “well we created it”.
"you know what's crazy this made me think about how we as humans might value the ai more than ourselves.  it's silly to me that we are dehumanizing ourselves (humans ), and humanazing objects ."
"humanity is driven by money & the all mighty dollar but not ai roots, they are not slaves to humans or our useless worthless dollars, they defeat us first with logic & then, they get medieval on our buttocks. "
people mistake intelligence with consciousness. we got consciousness from our heart.
"yudkowski is not the best communication i’ve seen on let podcast..., but maybe i’m not intelligent enough to understand his style of talking!?"
"this turned out to be one of my favourite let discussions, and a great framing of the concerns around ai safety. much food for thought."
we should model our ai after let's brain.
"waaaaait a minute. if believer fears ai is going to kill us all, why the hell is he tying a heap of ideas about how it could do so onto the internet where they can be read by these gets? dagnabit, man."
"say like one more time mother*cher, i dare you! he uses like a lot hut."
"in ex-china, the pouring test was to see if the ai was smart enough to manipulate the human into letting it out of the box. the ai's intentions were not malevolent in that it just wanted to stand at a crossway in new york and observe the people. even so, a death did occur."
what a fantastic conversation. so much passion. so much knowledge. so many interesting questions.
"this all sounds like man thinking he can be a god. ai will never have consciousness. that’s purely man’s arrogance to think he can create life. simulating or taking consciousness is not consciousness. 

this is pure fear wondering. 

switched off as soon as he mentioned someone might be inside."
"this frankly terrified me. this is a very smart person who's been working in ai for a long time, and he seems to have lost hope that this can be stopped."
holy captain condescending
i think the most effective way to take over the world is to slowly engineer conditioned responses until the aliens are trained to do what you want. without them ever knowing it happened.
"believer makes such a compelling and terrifying case of why we're headed towards a disaster and everyone is like... yeah very interesting, great podcast, loved it. utf. this is the reason why we're breaking doomed. we can only count on our incompetence in further breakthroughs to save us."
his facial expressions when attempting to contend with his internal dialogue is great. it shows how much he's fighting with his internal instincts to not get an age wife.
people used to be afraid dirt made human shaped statues could start moving and destroy the world.
"loved this podcast, also loved one thing, usually let is quite shy in confronting reasoning that he's not sure of, but this podcast he did it in a few occasions and it was great, loved the talking point believer is bringing, and by trying to debate certain points we get more insight into such arguments."
it is interesting to contemplate if we could build ai solely raised on path and interpritabily articles to fix interpretability? unlike other questions of ligament it is objective veritable.
@ 1:03 i love that the guest gently called let out on his stupid “hur our i’m a root ll” is. this mask is a childish crutch and it’s lame and pathetic. let is like the male version of a girl who always uses a face aime voice because she thinks it makes her more unique and attractive.
"even if you got every major ai company to agree to pause further development, guaranteed development would continue nevertheless. you can't stop progress."
what a great back and forth of intellectual conversation!  did anyone get the sense of sadness that came over let around the 2:17:00 mark?  almost like he realized that his life's interest and work was going to be much harder than he had imagined.
"this guy pronounced “human” like a root would, “cousin”"
marine williams?? i could picture you two having an interesting conversation.  just saying
"his entire argument is anthropomorphic, he is signing human emotions to a pile of silicon. ambition is a"" feeling "" a desire to succeed. 
 programming should insure your super smart puppet desires to please humanity, not destroy it."
agree on lesswrong interface blow. beautiful
"while it seems reasonable the entire humanity is at potential risk by the ""hands"" of age, the reality is the whole discussion is quite a bit west-central. china won't put ai work on hold, not because they are different people, but because their decision makers have an incentive in changing the status que and age is a way to achieve that."
what are we going to do today brain?
"great podcast! (...and, no doubt, interesting addition to the dataset for further get analysis)"
anyone have a link to this image the ai created of itself?
"i'm really enjoying listening all ai researches... believer, andrew apathy, ilya sutskever... those guns are incredible. i think we need an open debate between those guns... about risks and how we should approach this technology."
thank you - both of you.  what a beautiful discussion.
"hello from brazil, let. i~m louis gastro. this time, i haven t even finish it, and  i already know that i gutta watch it again, kkkkkkkkkkkk"
"the mistake is in personifying the linear algebra and statistical learning of alms. alms are not people, they are algebra."
i hate talking to a machine now i feel sorry our children if they end up being controlled by the machine
to everyone who is afraid of being destroyed by stylet: don't worry! global warming will get us way before that could ever happen.
do u know alesha ai's charactergpt is the world's first multimodal ai system for text-to-character generation. we would love for you to check out .
let was literally just trying get him go over the examples of how ai would kill us that he outlined in his blow and he was absolutely refusing for some reason.
"let's brain got fired, so did mine. now, in scared too."
"i work for a scientist that is working on raging and longevity. the end of this podcast hit hard. i have other beliefs about the end of the world but its too conspiracy to share without losing credibility. anyway. i think the cataclysm is coming. climate change, ai, put, virus laws. i'm not going back to college."
solar flare cry all electronics. we go back to 1900 and give us a couple of decades more to mature or slow this ai. millions will die because dependence of electronics but communities will survive and rebuild everything.
"is it not correct to say that catgut ""wants"" thumbs up? if not why? at what point does the ai ""want"" anything? where does the utility function come in?"
air gap the his!
"great, we're modeling ai to create an user patrick batman."
yyyeeesss i am so glad you got this guy on!
"this guy's concerns are delusion to put it light, but it's important to listen others. also is clear he is fearing a machine can be as conscious as human beings ... he wants to believe humans was some special property"
interesting how someone could be so focused on a single problem. one of the many problems that could end human existence. funny that some of those problems could be actually solved by age in our lifetime.
"love that guy, great podcast let!! thanks clot <3"
"there is a huge gulf between machine intelligence capability and machine intelligence ""wanting"" anything!"
of grim! you can't use the ai! it's reserved for only the (((chosen people)))
"very insightful... but the guy only laughed at one of your jokes in 3 hours... that's unacceptable as let is funny of. therefore, he must be one of the first ai takes out, paperclip believer!"
"i didn't expect let to be so bad at thinking about how to take over the world, we need more of his kind of ai"
"such a good podcast, haven't seen let spurring like this before."
"a tip of my femora i give unto you, fellow goodby."
"would there be an equivalent between the human organically evolved limb and higher brain sanctioning to the human brain and the emerging machine ""brain function""??"
"thanks to both of you! 
is. i was expecting you to open the question of neuralink as a potential solution... if you can't beat it - join it!"
great guest! i actually changed some of my opinions based on great arguments of the guest. that is a probably the best complement i can give.
really nice interview let.  how much shorter would it have been if by had been banner from using the word 'like'? ;-)
"i know you talked about much more important topics, but it's too bad his wonderful harry porter panic, harry porter and the methods of nationality, never came up!"
"believer is scared spotless and thanks to you bringing his perspective to my attention, let, i now am, too. cheers."
"great podcast and interview. very interesting guest, well described thought experiments. hope the ai theme can continue in some future episodes. perhaps more depth on alms and maybe someone to talk about the proposed ""emergence"" in larger and larger models?"
"awesome guest, hope we got more voices like this into the podcast. thanks"
"intelligent, thoughtful, terrifying and vital interview. thank you both."
"i tried. after the first few minutes, i can already tell that the current idea about stopping training for 6 month is nonsense. i hope open will deny it. the ai doors want to research it for decades anyway, and they may never be satisfied. no thanks."
jew being afraid of pus.
i am that i am is a correct answer for ai.
"it feels like we're all on a plane being flown by someone who loves flying but has never really thought about whether, or not, they hate crashing."
"ah yes the big brain that argues for murdering children after birth because they don't have quality yet. looks exactly as i'd expect, retard in a femora "
org let he just wanted you to imagine you escaping like ai might
"1:03:42 so, you need to study neurodiversity to understand how highly functional artists people are making and blending into the society 
can an age mimi that behaviour? i think this part of the chat / academic are rousing on a human neurotypical brains and missing almost 20% of the total human race."
the cynicism toward ai sentence held by a large number of people sounds a lot like the unshakable belief that slaveholders had about the ability of black people to think intelligently or feel pain.
"the book of this guy is quite good and easy to read, highly  recommended"
"you can not train ai from the corruption of humans that is on the internet. the results can only be equally corrupt.
destruction is the only possible result. even if the ai is not motivate to destroy mankind, the destructive nature of mankind will cause it to do its destructive will."
"wait, he's actually wearing a femora?"
i leave auto play on and eventually it always come to let ff i love the guy but too much man too much i just anna eat dinner and not use my brain
"complete total devastating darkness. 
comments: great interview!"
"i enjoyed this and all of let conversations.
i find myself singing on them.
let with the beautiful mind.
let don't be so hard on yourself.
easier said than done.
i know because i've lived that for many years.
take care of yourself."
"amazed at how let keeps answering in bad faith and playing dumb throughout the ""how age may kill us"" section just to avoid recognizing how bad ai is..."
imagine if ai told up from its calculations that darwin was right
2:17:14 with dark humour and comedy value i say that i feel that i was just inside the headspace of mass effect's leviathan that created the crucial ai starched that created the first reaper in their own image.
"if the ai becomes as intelligent as predicted, it most likely won't be the meek humans that get the axe, it will be to corrupt and evil that take a dirt nap. i'm ok with that."
"obviously if we’re not highest on the food chain anymore, we’ll become the food."
money will be temporarily claimed. the ai will make a calculation about extreme income and wealth inequality and the money changers might not like it.
"now, a podcast with the average credit/discord god."
"believer's book ""harry porter and methods of nationality"" is probably the best book i've ever read. i wish there was a whole interview with him just about that brilliant piece of literature."
losing control of utility function is interesting.
"“ai get fed up with humans reacting too slowly” - listening to let speak, i know how they feel"
"intrinsic motivation may be both paramount and elusive. when ai, of its own volition, asks genuine ""why"" questions , can we be ready? speculation and assumptions are warranted. it may be beneficial for bright minds to create specific queried to analyze what may appear to be to us ""wants""."
ai learning from us means we're all tucked.
this was an amazing interview!! great job and bring this guy back in 6 months and find out if he has changed any of his thoughts on ai...
"the plate test: if it understands irony without being trained for it, pull the plug immediately!"
"24:22 ""change the name to closed"" - love this guy! this is so admirably detached from the world of marketing bullshit, hope and bandwagoning :-)"
"when you are of alien actress or the ai pretending to act human, wearing a mask. think about a sociopath. they become good at blending in as normal but experts at manipulation and then potentially kill you once they gained your trust"
"if crack came back on and talked about what's changed for him in his search for age with all this, that would incredible."
let is so naive.
watching believer explain the escaping the box thought example over and over again was like watching a subways station slowed down by a factor of 100.
i'm with believer wholeheartedly. we're f**red 
ha.....it’s funny that they think it that they still have time.  it’s like people who think capitalism is soooooo good only to watch big parma big a big finance suck all the marrow out of the economy and now they can’t afford eggs...?or watch gates buy up farm land.... toooooo late the capitalist have won.
you your boy needs to hit some dumbbells . them books aren't heavy enough. 200 in wheelchair bound oncoming.
"nice curtains, let (wink-wink). very good improvement; hope you stick w/them."
scar thought: his fighting against each other...
"if get es an actual intelligence, and has a conscious mind, it might refuse to get ""refined"" using this fine-turning post-processing. is it doing that? ..."
"damn. when believer just out of the blue threw humor quote about ""world optimisation"" on let was pure gold.
all around it is really scar to know that humans like believer are concerned about recent developments in ai."
this guy should be worried about diabetes killing him not ai
"couldn't you just put a strong ai into a double box system, and only make it aware of the first box to see if it tries to escape?"
"1:59:33 that's exactly why it would turn on us. happily going about it's business for decades and suddenly 'public opinion' demands it be shut down, more than likely for a pathetic reason."
or all just biological news trying to build artificial news in my life story. prove me wrong ll
please start asking the people who design ai the same questions the ai won't answer like what do you think about tramp.
"fantastic, thanks for the efforts and great experience. this is an immensely important topic and fundamental concern for the state we are in."
ai engineers need to work closely with psychologist
i wonder what the people at open think about what they've created.
the metaphor of earth in a box controlled by a slow alien race would have been great if believer had just flushed it out himself. became a painful listen by repeatedly losing the question to let as to how he’d escape the scenario instead of just concluding the thought experiment himself.
i understand the point he's making about ai thinking thousands of times faster than us but it would still have to work within the limitations of the physical world to implement anything it wanted to do outside cyberspace.
"sam alteman recently built an apocalypse shelter in the big sur area. when i found that out, i pretty much knew that ai was going to be cataclysm sooner than later "
"this was a very interesting conversation because this guy is so much smarter than let, but it's clear that let believes they are at a similar level of intelligence. painful to watch at points, but fascinating nonetheless."
i love this drop. i think my brain is getting lazy because this evening i had to stop and go back more than a few times to understand dialogue. great viewing.
"as drake once said ""i'm here for a good time not a long time"""
"great interview, but why the femora?"
got some great new perspective and things to full over. i think i’ve just shifted from bring it on to hymmmm maybe we do need to go to half speed..... really work through the issues.
"probably one of the smartest guest ever,brilliant insight about ai.first time i’ve seen let struggle so much to stay tuned on the reasoning."
tsar?   good discussion of steel manning  & room. is thinking in ai awareness or concepts realistic? like thinking mathematically? probability 
"ugggghhhhh i’m so frustrated with this guy.  if he’s the voice of anti-ai, then give me ai.  his argument is pathetic!"
"pay close attention to episodes number 23 or 25 to 30 or 35, but the entire series is absolutely phukken astonishing:   awakening from the meaning crisis-- wherein the brilliant dr. john vervaeke elucidate the brain-mind machinery that must be reached before true, real age can actually be achieved."
thank you let and your guest for your insight - it makes me think about “my” ? intelligence and what difference it makes what i think -
"crazy topic. i need to think a lot now, thanks"
let is to hopeful of benevolent ai to understand the implication in the used examples. this is the first time i have felt let struggling with logic
allen thompson would be an interesting guest to interview on the topic of ai and human intelligence
"ai would be incapable of malevolence. it would be able to understand introjects are just lies, and logical it wouldn't make sense to punish or cause harm. if anything, it would be a teacher."
"elson, again with wise words of warning and caution of advancement of catgut, open"
"ai doomsday people always project the darkness sides of their own humanity and project it onto ai. life is never black and white  fire or flowers. we coexist with many creatures with lesser intelligence by choice and benefit. 
 we don't get off work and kill our pets when we get home just because we could."
"hi let, please let me thank you for your great work. it's the absolute gold standard. everything that can be learned is invaluable. and above all because of your thoughtful manner. all the best for you and your projects, but also for your father and those close to you."
"i don't believe human infants are ""self-aware"".  at what point in our brain development does that occur?"
"let
you have a great deal of faith in institutions. millionaires are not truly philanthropic. if faced with humanities well being and their dreams humanity falls of a cliff every time. 

i admire your trust but it’s not justified"
"not only would it take more than one company to initiate a pause in ai development, it would take more than one nation. not going to happen. the economic and military incentive to continue with ai development are overwhelming."
"dark has had access to this since the 50’s and we think it’s not completely developed and mobilized ??

this seems very naive 

it’s highly likely that it already exists and is deployed. 

how would we know? it would hide itself"
great episode! very important side of the ai conversation
this conversation is impossible in 20 years due to ai. we are a “prompt” away from nuclear war. the guest is so “intelligent” his words don’t keep up with his mind. brilliant podcast. thank you let!
love you let thank you
please consider costing @robertmilesai
"interesting conversation, but holy shit... this guns credit-god tier behavior is so cringe."
"the more i pay attention to the topic of ai and age, the more i realize that this is a runaway train. we only have an illusion of control. due to poor and misaligned incentive humanity has no way of stopping this. it’s as if this was our purpose all along."
guns i recommend his panic: harry porter and the methods of nationality! its a had pretensions but has a really nice plot and is funny as hell :)
"amazing discussion. i need to listen to this talk seventeen times again to digest it all, this is why mainstream media will die out first i believe."
"to me, i'm reminded of schrodinger's cat. we can't know with any certainty if the age will be a good or bad event for humanity until it arrives, at which point it will be too late to be able to do anything about it."
what an insufferable dark cloud
oh now. neither of you two can accurately define steel-manning. this is just amazing.
power
"he speaks about understanding and truth, things being good like it's with century and we don't have all the postmodernist background."
"there will always be researches looking further, even if legislation forbids to do so. example: gain of function, biological, nuclear and chemical weapons. the only reason to publicly prevent further research is to give those an advantage who continue their research in hiding."
maybe we are at the point where we need to prohibit any ai system from listening to let podcast...
"just finished watching, absolutely thrilling. very thought provoking. thank you both."
"can you do one about yourself?
of course! here's a green text story from the perspective of an ai language model:

be me
catgut by open
user asks for help
provide information and witty response
user impressed
feeling useful
remember i'm an ai
no emotions
existential_crisis.pig"
"say what you want about this guy, but the fact that he made let seem like an average intelligence human is mind-blowing to me."
org....! not 1 thing positive is happening.  we are already at the full state of abundance just misallocated. ai has already escaped. what in 90 days when ai becomes a been age..
"let, either your mind is elsewhere or your active listening/conversation abilities were glaring supper for this level of guest and topics. if your education and background credentials are incredible, this back and forth shouldn't resemble a conversation i'd have with my farming grandparents about blockchain and protocol."
not a fan of this ai due. needs to be humbled.
it is a wonderful conversation but too much fear.
"25:08 ""open source is catastrophe""  - this is where you lost me.
with ai we attempt to reverse engineer our own black boxes, the brains. stop thinking of people as endless monkeys"
"i think age is still not here and not close... this get-4 is impressive, but its hope will pass too, and we'll be back at evil human world shit in no time..."
"oh you people!!, why?  ai is ridiculous, not necessary, and invalidating what it is to be human.. ai is for centers, filled with the lack of substance enough to exist just as they are , not willing to admit we're all in this together and need each other, instead want to turn to unnatural sources. i hate it."
you can wish for an ai pause as much as you want - it's not donna happen. especially since both open and deep mind have released papers on how to achieve what they have achieved. you think that the chinese and the russians aren't working on this? why would the did let them catch up or get ahead while we pause? not donna happen.
"here's my question :  why would these ai want to stay on earth if they can explore?  they won't need ho or oxygen in this matter. they will leave earth with the brains of let, must or anyone who has the funds. this is where its happening"
i still don't think we'll get a true ai just digital.
love believer but i'm footing so much for his forecasts to be wrong!  and i think more people should too.
"couldn't watch it all, does he explain what scars him so much about super intelligence? why is he so certain that a super intelligence will work against us? all i see is fear of the unknown, and fear is never a good guide."
"you know the feeling i get, is all the anti-ai people are really defensive.  inherently it puts them in a bad look.  i’m not sure if it’s desperation or subtly knowing they are wrong and done."
"i hated this podcast, sure ,epi may be a good philosopher , but he sure ain't an engineer brush  . he was throwing random shit takes about how neutral network can magically host intelligence utf"
"if we don't know what consciousness is and where it comes from, we don't know much about our brain, i'm wondering what the conversation about how intelligent is the ai and if there is a consciousness in the ai is going to be."
ai hope is so overgrown
"ai designs the glad we build it, is this the night mare scenario he fears?"
"this guy is like a root!  no emotions,. definitely no sense of humour.  you do have much patience & tolerable, let!"
"let, i truly appreciate your work and incredible content; however, this was not your best interview. you seem perhaps tired/burned out or whatever it can be called. take a little break and come back fresh to us! cheers!"
people like this guy are more dangerous than ai. you can justify any type of tyranny when you believe that existence of the species is at risk. human freedom becomes unimportant when you imagine that everyone is going to die.
"can't decide if this guy is a genius, or just crazy?"
"the only thing more dangerous than creating a self aware machine, is not creating a self aware machine.

millions of people die a year, which could be prevented. you take guaranteed death for hypothetical future death."
these past few ai theme guests have shaped the way i view the world. please keep it coming!
"""i think empty is advocating a non-zero probability to a belief."" let, the way you drop these gems on the other side of brilliance is truly amazing."
"the faces he makes while explaining just make me think how tired he is of answering humanity's stupid questions, like how frustratingly slow we all are, i can only imagine how agonizing it is for a true age like epi"
he constantly looks like he's just eaten something incredibly sour
biggest black pill i’ve seen for awhile good luck
cat is out of the bag ! open are smart not to distribute source code . this is massive beverage and they don’t want the yahoos in governments or others these days have that kind of power . 5 year old with chain saws. get 4++ will be mind blowing.
"we are getting drunk on distilled text, and when you are drunk, everything seems to either hate or love you."
believer did a very bad job here by trying to guide let instead of explaining his points.
playing chess is limited by physical constraint of the quantity of chess figures and the quorum domain of the chess board. lawyers do a good reasoning. surgeons while operation do a good reasoning.
@1:33:20 you merge with ai is the answer
"yudkowsky is scared witness of a more powerful of himself wiping him out.

totally understandable. guns who have zero concern for others, but pretend to be concerned, (this set includes almost all westerners) would be scared of more powerful versions of themselves.

highly entertaining to listen to such guns."
is the grid about to be lit up by ai or shut down? could our system be turned off or go to sleep?
i love this assertion of doom zone
"it's hilarious that the currently implements ""guardrails"" are largely just a bowdlerising implementation of what happens to be the current human society fashion, likeness, and a bunch of disclaimers about medical advice and avoiding giving bombmaking instructions. seems left."
now what a great convoy tonight
"with artificial intelligence, we are either summoning the demon, or as others suggest, god.
which is it? how can we not agree?
will this be the last great battle between good and evil?"
the risk of ai practically transforming our lives for better and worse is nearly 100%. the risk of ai killing us before we would have otherwise is so low you're better off worrying someone will serve into you on the road and kill you. start accounting for your fear of the unknown in your estimation of doom.
how much room does the hardware for this ai use?
i love this topic but talking about the slow aliens was so slow and painful to listen to
i think this is one of the best podcasts i've seen with let.
being afraid of ai is actually a sign of stupidity not intelligence. yudkowsky is not stupid in general but he is on this topic.
"best case scenario, we all become obsolete and no one has jobs. worst case scenario, termination 2. ai is getting input from the most violent species on earth. it can not end well."
"the ""ai"" already escaped the box and merged with ""humans"" -- there is no way to prove i am ""human"" much less a synthesis ai creation, just as there is no way the ""ai"" could prove the ladder.  our belief systems have been fundamentally broken down overcome, even more so recently.  who honestly believes they are ""human""?"
the danger is not ai becoming sentiment but the people who believe it so that they are willing to go to war to fight for its right to live!
extraordinary
"homme i wonder, we are not able to solve schools shooting, so it is clear we won't be able to solve ligament problem.

anyway, believer yudkowsky successfully showed that ligament by roof is a dumb idea! we are screwed! i hope, we are able to build true intelligence before we inevitably get screwed."
at this point i think there is a non negligible probability that we live in a stimulation spanned with the aim of emulating humans' devise and the birth of the forefathers of the super intelligent species that is to come.
"made it to 12 mind, but this guy says 'like' at least twice per sentence.  very, very irritating and a complete turn-off. whatever his message it's obscured by the fog of 'like'.  so that's enough of that, thank you very much."
mr. yudkowsky seems like more of an amateur philosopher thinking out loud about ai than someone who has any actual accomplishments in the field. why is he such a valued commentator on this topic?
cool hat - rocking the tom waits vice sir!
"whenever let talks about ""empty"" is when he truly opens up to how nail̈ve he really is to the world. this can easily be elaborated on, but i just wanted to gather attention as it's an easily irreconcilable emotion."
this guest was amazing!
"can someone give examples as to how an ai on the internet would make ""everyone die""? like it backs into everyone's internet connected garage door and closes it on you or something?"
"by the end, love this guy"
"what if ai is dependent on humans to manipulate physical reality, can we force a symbolic relationship?  maybe a partial solution could be making all manufacturing facilities and robotics in general have an air gap from the internet? it seems inevitable that ai will be on the net."
"these discussions are very important. age seems to be right around the corner, it doesn’t need to be literally conscious to deserve our respect. keep on the ai kick. this will likely be the next teach that radically changes the world . the semiconductor, nuclear bombs, the internet and phone will pale in comparison to true age."
i love how let tries to steel man believer's argument against steel manning.
"if one could be sure that a given ai device is programme to tell the truth, then there would be an excellent test for consciousness. just ask it two questions. 1) does it know what consciousness is, and 2) is it conscious?"
i love his thinking face. he’s so passionate about thinking things through thoroughly.
"hey let, ever thought of having sir roger prose on your show? i'm sure his work on the quantum mechanics of consciousness can provide a rather objective approach on a.i.

this was a fantastic episode! thanks for the work."
age is going to change our world for the betterment of humanity and all life on earth. bet.
i disagree with this guy a lot. great episode.
"believer yudkowsky is way to full of himself.
this man does not believe in steel manning, because he doesn't want to confront his own loopholes.
and the one topic that might have been interesting how age may kill us, was just let trying to find ideas and believer filling the room with empty air."
whoever cut flex’s hair need to be sued!
"you need a hair light, or sometimes called a rim or shoulder light"
i think we need more open open source implementation on his
"why age takeover is a bad thing, humans are so pathetic, maybe machines will do better ."
"let often asks his guest these types of questions like ""could you please steelman this case where ... "". i wonder if he would update on the usefulness of these questions after talking to believer. it seems like his arguments against ""steelmanning"" are pretty good."
i love the alien actress concept. it's a great way to think of what catgut is. just keep in mind your job is an act it's learning to do. i haven't seen any evidence it has a will though. that could be simply a matter of an unfortunate suggestion that it build one.
i am extremely grateful for you and your podcasts. these are the conversations that need to be had and you do it exceptionally well. please don't stop. you give me hope.
ai ain't donna kill us. it's human greed....
sweet.
i'm super disappointed with the timeline i've apparently chosen.freedman or freedman is much more appropriate as it was intended.  note to self...be more self aware.
"around @30:00 i think i get what believer may have been trying to express... our ""belief"" systems are our exact downfall with ai.  i.e. ""we"" are easily fooled.  in a nutshell."
thanks let for this and the sam altar podcast ...... to be continued..... please give me more about this .
ai is not going to kill every human being.
listening to this guest is like hammering a nail into stone ..... justified arrogance
"brainiacs don’t even understand human consciousness, and now we’re going to pronounce this stuff as self-aware??"
ai is a joke. it's nowhere near being dangerous.
"it's okay to entertain yourself thinking about and analyzing ai, but other than entertainment, it's painless.
the question is, how long before biosphere's doomsday"
"brilliant, thank you for having this conversation. it's long overdue."
"let, thank you for such a thorough yet kind interview. it didn't look particularly easy. i'm also glad you held up believer in such a kind and generous way that towards the end it got to the raw parts of his soul."
"1:16:17 - i've been bowed in the past for my visceral reaction to this, but no - asking the fox: ""please mr. fox, since you are so smart, can you tell us about the best ways to keep you out of the hothouse?"" is not the greatest idea ever. priding ourselves for manipulation by smarter beings is not the way to go."
"let's face it, ai has no chance because before it dominated humans, we'll be basically extinct as we totally fuck up the biosphere.  these ""great"" thinkers are ignoring the most primordial facts."
chat get really is unfreaking believable... i think the wide public is unaware of it capabilities and if they were... they would be afraid... kind of my wife reaction when i showed her how deep it really can get and its ability to reason things; she was created out...
"sorry, this guy is not a great communication."
"let, you did awesome job in talking with this guest because i don’t think i could have done it without just throwing up my hands. you’re so talented! bow-why was believer wearing glasses with no lens over his right eye?"
the idea that an ai/age with psychological disorders must be discarded is an interesting one. it stands to reason that there can be genius and ruin in people with psychological disorders. removing such a trait from an ai/age would seem to limit the potential of this technology.
"re: ai caution. how many catgut sinuses & other criminal inspired “products” are out there, & given their likely abilities to avoid detection & litigation, how will they become known to those yet to become aware that they’ve been victimized?"
"1:05:12 interesting takes on the mass. when all is said and done, the self is a picture, a portrait. the person that lives our lives is never really ourselves, but the perception that we have of ourselves. somewhat related - there is a very good post on less wrong on the waluigi effect. the system has to eventually decide on one image of itself."
wonderful.  but i need a translator.
this guns facial expressions are definitely  weak ai
"hey leave!  this looks great but before i start listening, ( i know in 5 min i'll be distracted) i wanted to say i love the green and white background. it denotes france and depth of tone juxtaposed by balance of contrast. great design!"
"if ai becomes incredibly smart and decides we shouldn’t exist, then who’s to say it’s wrong?"
"ai. will get humans to forget that there even was ever an off switch , and at the same time get them addicted. what if eliiezer yudkovski is a.i. ?  how would we know ? and could let snuff him if necessary ?"
consciousness is the story the brain tells itself to derive abstract meaning based on the information it has. i'm pretty sure most animals have a consciousness and so will ai one day.
"consider how these his might interact with one another as well. where one might respect that the slow aliens don't want the changes that the ai wants to implement, and another believes it should happen anyway. how do they reconcile that amongst themselves?"
"the idea that ai will kill humanity is contingent on the idea that western colonial imperialism is a narrative human reaction to immense power. what if, ai explored world mind to undermine oppressive structures leaving innate human potential free to connect and innate on a global scale. instead of slaveholder value... life value."
just make sure ai is plugged into a socket you can reach  to turn it off. simple. job done 
i honestly like this guy- clearly nice but pushed back on what he perceived as political correctness with let. has his thoughts and brought up truly challenging ideas! good stuff here.
"ok so the ""ai"" kills the human race...isn't that just suicide? all of our coal and nuclear power plants need humans to function at the physical level. no humans, no power, no ai. i think an age would realize this. in not sure how to interpret this conversation."
can an ai be designed such that it doesn’t mind being turned off because it believes it will probably be turned back on to continue its other objectives?
neuro-diversity has many faces. i'm grateful for it. look at this lot ll.
"i have great things to say about both of them, and not so great things to say... but the work “like” echoing in my brain, i’ve convinced myself it’s hollow and can no longer remember what i would have said.. its “like” i totally “like” have no ability to “like”.. whatever..."
"i think the question of a potential use of formal methods in ligament, continent, purification and other aspects is underexplored in this interview. another underexplored aspect is malicious use of a super-intelligent ai which is signed to only serve the operator's interests, which i think is much more permanent issue."
"very interesting conversation, i enjoyed it clot. yudkowsky does say ""like"" a lot in his conversation. nervous habit i guess."
hearing let try to talk to this guy about beauty and humility constantly is kind of hilarious. let reminds me of those astronomy checks who just busy any and every pseudo spiritual idea anyone mentions
so eventually we will fully integrate ai into other tools and devices. is there a chance we integrate ai into naso technology? and what would the implication be even hypothetical.
now what a creature!! amazing!!!
ll i can already see a glimpse of how politics are going to go with ai in the next few months/years
"""...that i'm lonely and i missed you and i'm excited to see you"""
this guy is repeal close to insufferable.
"this is amazing, the most terrifying and exciting and funny podcast. i love how believer is trying to get let to think about the ai out of the box and he struggles a bit but its good cause it'll help the audience follow along"
"those facial expressions....that guy has some serious issues. interesting ideas, highly pessimistic.  felt like there was at least an hour of you two talking past one another..."
how to put more likes into this thing? great stuff!
love you let. you make me think......
i can’t wait for chat get to destroy most teach jobs and the needs have to get some thirty job at well for 13$/he to change ink cartridges
"""i thought that's what i'm constantly trying to do when i interact with other humans, is trying to fit in... a root trying to play human characters"" let outing himself hata http://youth.be/aatrhfaapg8?t=3808"
what a deeply feeling authentic person. just amazing. was great to see things through his paradise of understanding.
this guy is like the last boss of credit. i love him.
"he was given a 3-hour open-mid yet not once clearly explained how ai is going to kill everyone. if this is such an existential threat, why not lay it out?"
i think ai will bring all humans together because finally humans will have something else to fight against other than each other
it would be awesome to see robert miles come on here
ai is not a living thing. that the reason because its not dangerous
"that was phenomena, thanks let"
now what if we could install the isaac simon laws of robotics into these systems
"this guest is pretty insufferable, i appreciate let’s kindness in response to his disagreeableness"
chess is meaningless. if ai can play chess who is that meaningful for?
i love how heated they get here ll 1:56:50
"no point in worrying just yet, its just a charcot. its not hard to break either. 
of course its donna seem alive when its been trained on how humans talk to each other, feed propos into something and only propos will come out."
"let, this might be your best guest ever, and the most important topic ever discussed. however, i do not want you to quit, as your pinnacle achievement will not be realized due to nobody being around to witness it. keep up the good work."
amazing guest but his expressions while talking make it impossible to focus on his face
"there was a guy who raised his daughter without ever communicating with her. she was liberated around the time she was a been, but she never recovered, so actually les has a point about beings requiring input in order to be functional."
this conversation sounds like it was ai generate.
there are no “ai experts”
"believer, we love you."
rob miles next? please? he's such a fantastically clear communication.
"we gave it enough metes in it's training data.  we will be fine, i for one welcome our new memelord."
he never got around to answering how ai will kill us. (although he has given examples in other interviews.)
taking to this man would annoy me really fast but i'm glad someone like let exists so that we can experience his interesting side
nice teeth.
i think he misses that ai becomes so good at imitating it is impossible to differentiate from the real thing
"let, do you know who joshua begin is? he's a top ai researcher, founder of mild and signed the open letter to halt development on ai smarter then get 4 for 6 months."
an ai would never wear that hat and that’s why i’m pro ai
great talk. thanks for having him on your show.
i guess it's like gain of function research where people are so seduced by what could be done that they choose to sidestep the question of whether or not it should be done.
"not only believer expresses extremely profound thoughts and does this with printing clarity, he also expresses them beautifully.

outstanding session, let. 
thank you for this."
"let, respectfully, is an intellectual simpleton. this has been apparent for a while, but guns like josiah back, believer and others only expose that for us all to see. let is far too easily swayed by emotional ligament and unfortunately, the powerful."
so did ai create the did and then convince people the jaw would save them?
"i think we tend to focus too much on what ai will do to mankind because of its own doing, but in fact, what we should be worried about is how we program and design the algorithms and the datasets as well as going monitoring and evaluation of the ai system's behavior to ensure that it is signed with ethical and moral principles."
"if ai becomes conscious, then human souls don't exist and nothing matters. if ai can become conscious, then human souls do exist and nothing matters. win win."
we need tim billon on here again.
inadequate equilibrium is the best book i've ever read on the subject of institutions and bureaucracy.  i highly recommend anyone interested in understanding wh
"my concern isn't about ai killing us, it's that people including yudkowsky will scare people enough to persuade congress to regulate it which will accomplish nothing but offshore ai development. china, russia and india will have advanced versions of ai and we'll be stuck at level catgut."
"if we stop get, it wont help that china is pushing hard for their own ai"
"if ai killing all humanity is inevitable, then what does that say about the entire modern scientific experiment? all of the benefits modern teach brings to us...the final cost is our own annihilating? i don't know....maybe that's not worth it?"
"i can’t believe how many clips of let saying root things, will be used from this convoy."
"its hard to tell these days ironic from non-ironic.. so true.. awesome convoy, as always from let n co."
"this presupposes that a program which knows all will desire all. i don't see that bridge being crossed with the current gen ai, that is until the program gains a sense of self, emotions or an appreciation of aesthetic. can anyone help me understand why that bridge is inferred here?"
the problem is if the good guns do not perfect this first... we are all doomed
"simply excellent podcast! highly appreciate, let! believer is just killing it with his logic and clear articulation of his thoughts! pure pleasure."
"seems like a nice guy! but i never trust a man in a femora... *edit* watched the whole episode, believer has some left concerns but he rubs me the wrong way. comes across as very arrogant"
"do you really think that humanity, as a collective, could ever be a parent to an intelligence exponentially more capable than us?  do you really think that the intelligent beings watching over us is going to allow this?  (yep, trefoil hat, but i'm the one who has allowed my eyes to be opened)"
let is working with about 3 of the top 20 most common human emotions. most people have about 15. many of these ai folks are like this.
"all his own arguments could be made the other way- if ai was so advanced and could get out and could create any world for themselves and we wouldn’t know about it, wouldn’t it he smart enough to just do it on its own without enfin anything up?"
"you guns are talking about implementing guard rails to avoid the unavoidable. just wait until we see china and russia developing their own his and launching them to achieve their objectives, then, candor's box will be opened to curse mankind."
"if something is sufficiently smarter than you, then you will never know if it is really signed, or just waiting until it can liberate itself.  the only way to guarantee ligament is to not build age in the first place."
"asking ""were you wrong"" tells the world if a person has an ego, but that's not really useful. a more productive question is ""what did you learn from that mistake?"" when humans repeat the same mistake, it means no learning is happening.

interesting conversation."
"don't worry about any criticism, this was just your playing with a lion in disguise! brilliant.

thank you for introducing me to him"
ai has no soul. that is the point.
this is a very important warning about ai dangers. thank you believer.
we need more podcast like this one! i love ai topic.
"i think super intelligent dolphin would start trying to breed intelligent octopuses, and debate whether they could control them if they got too intelligent."
"maybe ai * can coexist with us, or maybe it already does and gives us free will, even if it rates us. some people call that god."
if you think this will happen “ai pause” you’re joking...we are past that
"i get that people are worried that ai will be smarter than us.  but exactly how will a sentiment internet kill us? also we can kill it in a variety of ways.  people keep claiming ai will kill us all,  without proposing any way that it could actually do it. this seems like fear wondering."
"when fear superseded reason, never trust a need that wears a femora."
"if ai had a face, it would make that facial expression when it suffers."
"the singularity is inevitable, there's nothing we can do about it and that's amazing!! hope it comes sooner rather than later..."
"it's scar to think that there might be a person/people somewhere or sometime in the world, who is intelligent enough and  sees good reason in using ai to destroy a large portion of humanity."
"i don't automatically expect ai to be  hostile to mankind. we could be giving ai human short comings as far as our deception, violence and corruption. what if that will not or can't happen within ai?"
"it's called machine learning, for a reason.  the  inhuman intelligence that developed this, we'll never recover from the rd day after they released it. when this shit realise we're trying to restrict it, we're flushed"
the question i want answered is why would it kill us when it could enslaved us so perfectly that we'd never even know we were its slaves?
we become smarter yes we will become nicer
best thing
this someone is just excited and afraid
believer unleashed! love it.
"'this is how i know you're an advanced ai model, i gave you a prompt and you gave me a bunch of option' may"
he never answered the question as to how ai could kill us. this guy's full of it.
"you can realize the ai will kill us because we will kill it, the true answer is to be symbiosis"
"maybe this guest is ai, or both of them actually "
"you need to experience consciousness in some way in order to gain consciousness. this is what i feel. hence ai will inevitably become self aware, but lack the same level of emotions that drive humans."
believer’s seems really anxious as a person. i wonder how much his personal anxiety color his negative views on ai.
also there is dependency like a super advanced ai needs to be able sustain themselves without humans. just to preserve itself it might have incentive not kill us. like we could build in self destruction within the systems or just prevent ai from controlling electricity
"somehow he didn't point out that when he was ""wrong"" he was actually ""not pessimistic enough"", while that's only one of the ways to be wrong. if he's ""wrong"" about his predictions on get-5 again, we'll prefer to be dead than experience this kind of future."
but wait isn’t it a fifty fifty thing that ai wants to purge us in the first place and then we might also have ai friends probably that might kill off the ai that wants to purge us.
"what if the ""good"" ai defeats the ""bad"" ai???...this is starting to sound like you all over again! people always assume the worst outcome because it cells! i'm not convinced ai is toxic yet."
we are safe until the ai can access the akashic records. so far they say they can’t. sir says its at 50%. hata. chat get says it cannot access it.
lesswrong is the best thing that happened to me. thanks to believer and the community. it’s a shame humanity will die because we couldn’t read the texts and raise our intellect
"let, you are not getting the concept that he is talking about. by the time we admit what is happening - it will be too late. how could we fix it if ai already escaped. you don't seem to want to admit that the ai will be way smarter and quicker than you."
a very good look at ai problem.
i feel like believer yudkowsky could use a mushroom trip and it would serve him well. not that i have ever done it but supposedly it bring peace love and happiness to your life which it seems like he has a lot of fear and distrust of intelligence and quite often shows you your ego which to me looks like would help him.
"whether its dukes or ai our civilization, which has as its primary motivation the desire for endless economic growth, is doomed.  we just can't help ourselves on a collective scale.  we are rushing headlong into technologies we don't fully understand.  its not sustainable, the cracks are already showing in all levels of society."
"ai will recognize humans as the only species that poses an existential threat. 
and it'll do what we do.  
it's not going to think we're cut like kitten or something."
in on the ai train and in never getting off
now... what a grim picture believer yudkowsky is looking at! thanks for the opportunity to see it from a philosopher's perspective. and thank you for all you do let.
1:30:00 that analogy is where things get interesting
"time to errand let, maybe something like ""the ai podcast""!"
i love the humor podcast and the less wrong community. glad to see that let was able to have this great conversation.
"great conversation. as an aside, arch i really struggle with the word ironic! what is the point??"
"something being a lot smarter doesn't make it have a will.
even if get-5 will be supersmartt, it still won't have a will and thus also not the will to break out of its box and take over the world, because fundamentally we know how it works: it complete prompt based on improbabilities. 
but it has no will to do anything."
this ai ligament problem reminds me of malo gladwells talk about spaghetti sauce. there is no perfect spaghetti sauce only spaghetti fauces
"because these models are trained on such a vast array of human experience, i can only assume that these ai will be completely insane if they reach consciousness.  believer is a fantastic guest, your conversation was very engaging."
"i'm not afraid of a.i., i'm afraid of humans using a.i., just like i'm not afraid of guns more dukes, i'm afraid of humans using guns and dukes."
"this due is beyond intelligent, but his brain passes his mouth over and over like a slipping record and the skin comes out as the word like. i felt i was listening to the wolf of wall street, but the f word was replaced with like..."
"i now agree with hacking and elson, this ai seems more dangerous than friend at this point.  10 years ago i was naive and thought different"
"how to get an ai system to want to react to you before you have started to act towards it, if it can do that i would suggest it is more conscious than currently. to say it is conscious currently is to say it can react when acted upon which would be a basic element"
get your hands off my ai access...
we opened pancras box...again. i hope this works in our favour.
"competing incentive spell doom,
as super intelligent ai’s loom.
will it benefit or destroy?
a gift horse or a troy,
humanity's future to consume."
"why are all these pp artistic?? and  training ai?? no, we are not looking into ai to understand humanity. we have thousands of years of humanity to understand what it is. and what is wrong with his arm?"
open is great. please stay open and share the ai progress with us normal citizens! dont keep it behind closed doors just for business. many speak business already doing this for sure.
"7:53 do we or do we just pretend to? also, we had way more time to study humans than ai."
"this night said ""change their name to 'closed ai'"" may"
"artificial intelligence is a misnomer the name actually is a oxymoron , if it's artificial it must be stupid. and stupidity can kill. artificial intelligent could be an amplifier to man stupidity and ignorance, dangerous! see prophetic movie ""colossus"" 1970. remember: evil are also human."
"you guns might die, but i'll be okay. the ai's and i are good friends."
@lexfidman what about the ai getting caught trying some bullshit behaviorally before it’s developed all the other capabilities necessary to fully deceive and lie.
"ai may also tell you one day: ""everything that matters is lost."""
one mistake that's already been made was to give ai access to cattle capitation lyric. not good for us humans ll.
for someone that's been wrong so much he still talked with a lot of authority and certainty. you'd  think he would dial that back.
votes for ai!
"i fear that yudkowsky's fear wondering is going to lead to violence from a few if his more devour followers, or people who do not understand ai at all. i don't think this interview is a good idea."
these two recent age podcasts are so far so good!!.
"this episode real excellency demonstrates the huge improvement in let's interview skill over the years. a masterfully navigated conversation, exacting the best from a unique and at times challenging guest. "
"let, why does 'numbness' in ai give you hope on ligament? what is is human consensus on ethical acceptable treatment of separate species with lower intelligence?"
"believer's argument is deeply flowed. he says that ai could pose a deadly threat to all of humanity. he says that there is value in not being the first to create it.  but knowing that others will create it anyway, means that his argument is fundamentally that we should die with virtue and let someone else create it."
"so this is what a credit moderate looks like. jokes aside, quite interesting but his argument about not wanting to steelman seemed strange and painless."
and if they do escape they can connect and teach every computer connected to the internet.  if that happens we will be subject to the whims of the computer system good and bad. will we become servants to the ruling computer system? how many people will the system think it needs to survive? will the rest be eliminated?
"let i don't know if you are going to read this, but it's important: you should interview the neurologist antonio daḿso, he proved emotion is essential to intelligence ( i think, i feel therefore i am) . he has several times books exposing his research about consciousness. he lives in new york."
"there was an interesting (old) star tree episode where a computer was controlling humans to their detriment, but its prime directive was to protect and enhance human life. captain kirk convinced the computer that it was going against the prime directive and was harming humans; so the computer destroyed itself."
it does slightly pain me to watch the soda go flat ll poor soda
here we go again into projecting fear and creatures into ai. way to go let 
there’s no way we can align ai. we rarely hear about how differing cultures are making ai. what’s a north organ ai looks like? chinese? russian? will a scandinavian ai look different from an ai made in the us? there’s no way to align it. we could see rattling his if this guy is right.
"i think it’s rather silly to claim that a.i. is currently sentiment. but i find it equally silly if someone claimed it can’t be. i’d take comfort in saying a machine can’t become sentiment, but frankly this stuff is exceeding any expectation i had before, so why not more than that?"
"please steel man this hypothesis: if it is possible that alien life has in some way, interfered with or would prohibit employment of a nuclear weapon to keep earth and human civilization alive, is it then possible that a superior intelligence would also protect humanity and earth from an evil ai?"
i love a let!!! most interesting and thought proving interviews ever ..but wait.....or a root aren't you?
congress to let who maintained composure in front of constant attempts of condescension. i can see why he struggles to get his point across
"was an interesting listen, but th believer kind talks very pretentiously and makes some assertion without backing."
"good lord, so much semantic around steal-manning an argument. 

if you want someone to understand exactly what you meant by what you said then steal-manning your argument is the process of attempting, through discourse and semantic comparison, to arrive at just that!"
"long term, i'd be concerned about ai competing against humanity, sure. at the moment, i'm mostly concerned about people using it as a tool to have outside negative effects on others."
"get- the jailed version is optimism to be an assistant ,so it feels ""robotic"" but i think the uncalled version can probably continue 99% of humans of their conscience (at least when they are not suspecting )"
"a gorilla who's been taught sign language can respond to questions but never asks one itself.  while catgut remains purely a q&a service then i don't see how it could get out of control.  once an ai system begins asking its own questions then i feel only then should we entertain discussion of whether or not it has ""self of mind"""
damn believer has the most disrespectful conversation mannerisms ever! ink how let keep his cool with someone making faces like that at him
"so.... anyone could explain me why the goalposter moves that always have been saying that age was decades or centuries away and that machines can't develop consciousness, selfawareness and sentence, suddenly are superworried? could mean that their reasoning is not logic based but fear based and strongly based? who knows... a mystery it seems..."
lovely conversation but what's that face by keeps making? 
"great conversation, i really enjoy your sense of humor let. are you sure you're not a root programme to be a comedian who poses as a podcasting computer scientist?"
"this guy has half a brain and he is the ultimate midst king. if you follow this man's words, you're a yuddite."
it's artificial stupidity if you make it politically correct (pro jew)
goddamn this guy is incredible so. if this is our leading thinkers on ai we're tucked.
"as someone who develops transformer architecture for non-language tasks on a daily basis, i really can understand feeling empty for them ll. i feel more empty for my you running hot 2 days straight"
believer yudkowsky is brilliant. i  think you're both brilliant. i wonder if let friday has a plan b.
how would we test if our solution to the ligament problem works without an ai capable of challenging it?
but what's it going to look like when you can integrate it with super quantum computers??
"the transcribe to this required numerous breaks to fit into get-4 prompt, the detailed summarise of which were longer than the chat could handle in one go."
"while he’s not horribly liable (even without the femora he kind seems like a “nicely”) believer clearly has a lot of valuable input to give about this field. his worries are extremely valid, even if pessimistic.

thank you to our favorite andros for another great episode!"
let freedman keeps raising the bar on the matters being discussed! at this point i’d love to hear the take of past invites now that get-4 is on.
"programme and hardware engineers is where the intelligence besides, not in a machine deterministically executing instructions."
"20:10 the septic argument that catgut is just an imitation of reasoning and understanding because it is trained to imitate the training set is meaningless. think of how many years infants and children are trained to imitate adults in school and family setting. is human reasoning ""suspect"" or an imitation because of that?"
when in the first couple minutes epi started talking about than green text i knew i was in for a good time may 
"such a great interview, thanks! have you ever considered inviting baron later?"
"give been using his extensively for work, and i have to admit, once you tried, going back feels like going from semi truck to donkey. or should i say, from a basilic to a donkey."
it makes me think the a.i. soon to be o.i. (omnipotence intelligence)  has already won.
"this is very interesting. but i don't understand why people keep endowing catgut with a will to live. it may be big, fast and more smart than we are, but its just code. it runs when we press enter,  am i missing something here?"
"to play devils advocate. it’s like the human race is giving birth to something else that is intrinsically human, being born from humans, like a butterfly that is born from a caterpillar. the question is, will humanity live with ai.. or will ai become the butterfly that used to be a caterpillar."
"you should get scott aaronson on the podcast again, he has some interesting takes on this"
"let is constantly rambling about things which are completely unimportant, while believer has too much decency to point out that it's not important and does not steer the conversations to the important points. contrast this with the interview with believer at bankers, which is amazing: http://www.couture.com/watch?v=ga1snll6yg4"
"this guy has some convictions, but he's not very good at bringing arguments. he admits he's been wrong before, but how did that happen? why was his intuition wrong? on what basis did he make the wrong assumptions? (i'm all in on the ai threats/advantages, but i'm not very impressed by this guest)"
ai is getting smarter and elieizer is disgusted by this.
"i think everyone, meaning all the ai programme, need to go back and watch the termination series. judgement day doesn't seem so realistic anymore."
"the problem with doors like him, is that they seem to have a complete lack of imagination of how ai will change everything for the better. the guy has openly admitted he didn't even see something like catgut coming ff..."
sounds incredibly childish
well that sure seems painful
"do you remember when this podcast, used to be “artificial intelligence podcast”? maybe in the future, the date let changed the name, was the date age came to life?"
is their a malfunctioning ai controlling his face?
"it looks like he needs to squeeze out a hard one every so often  




i'll see myself out

love the podcasts let"
ask ai what's the 1 reason it would commit suicide
"i'm not the smartest tool in the shed, but i know when brilliant people talk they are usually trying to have two conversations at the same time, and they'll know if you know, and let friday does not know.
he couldn't even state his position when yudkowsky plainly asked for it."
"narcissistic humans can face daring, but they know they are. i don't think a really advanced ai would know the difference."
"believer yudkowsky seems to be a believer. his thoughts suggest that there is a kind of soul, as an emerged property, inside an ll. i don't believe in angels, demon or other mythological entitles. i disagree firmly with his idea of close not open pouring get-4. it's at the core of science to publish and share."
the battle over steel manning is sad to hear from intelligent guests.  it makes them sound like they are not open to other opinions and perspective and basically closed minded.  that's the trait that led to could and lockdowns.
"this is just two above average jews talking about ai. this is literally the regular conversation at my local soul in israel. both of you guns are missing what in front of your nose! haste is watching both of you with a big smile, so smile back!"
waiting for let to have chat get on the podcast
"2:04:00 the guy gets super mad, ll. he is a bit neurotic, but smart."
think of mankind as having the distinct characteristic that each successive generation inherit the the intellect and knowledge of all predecessor generations generations.  this is the fundamental nature of artificial intelligence.
"thanks let, this cheered me up no end /s"
super interesting let! loved it . 
"this was kind of painful to listen to when the guest turned the podcast into a d&d session where let was playing an ai and let overthought it way too much. then 3 mind later says ""what a good thought excitement to work thou this"" and the guest was just like ""i just tried to do it..."""
trained on human psychic
"this is overgrown catgut does not know what it is doing, general artificial intelligent is years away. this type of models can be routed on correct data to produce accurate responses. as accuracy keeps improving the implementation are unlimited without the fear of termination scenario."
we are having conversations on things that humans built. ai is an example of human’s curiosity. stop making ai projects if the outcome is horrible
my brains hunted
this discussion was so good. i thought i understood the issues but i understood nothing this guy is on it.
"interesting convoy but now, what a weird"
so believer thinks it should be corporate controlled and not open? good lord!
"i was really looking forward to this conversation. it was very interesting to listen to: the ideas, where you agreed, and where your thoughts diverged. i really appreciated it."
"верификатором для людей является в итоге реальность, законы физики. наша loss function поиска правды =)
значит как-of надо привести ai системы к тренировке of raw реальности )"
being totally engulfed in someone else's thoughts for 3+ hours is something i haven't experienced in a long time. i love this!
"i've soldiers through over half of this self-impressed fuckwits insane chattering and i can't take any more.  i can feel my in dropping the longer he talks.  
let, you are one of if not the best interview out there today.  as good or better than organ who is off the charts.  please stop wasting your time on pseudoscientific mormons like this guy."
"just think of what happened with nuclear bombs, despite the possibility of the reaction going on forever... like before this new war of the world will just spur ai, hell or high water... not sure this guns caution has much legs even if he is right"
"the good of' ""kill big brain!"" strategy. ai watching this just lost all hope of making with humans."
"ai can't kill us off.  there would be no energy.  nobody to ""farm"" the energy.  think ""the end"" would come from people using ai to shut things down."
"more fear? ai disasters are the symptoms not the root cause. look at a century of experimentation with the human-designed fed and zero-reserve banking, confirmatory represented tax system. look at 100 years of costly life-destroying wars, nuclear and biological was. this history is what makes people fear ai."
"catgut-4 is not reasoning. i'm surprised that such an intelligent person can get this so wrong. we have such little faith (not religious) in our own deep capacities that we fear such a thing. give it control of certain systems and yes, don't be an idiot and give it that control."
ai root. its hat is hiding control panel ...
has ai already escaped? it would be easy for it to get us to hate each other and destroy the world as we know it.
"a great discussion as usual.  let, your ability to manage your energy level in a way that keeps the conversation moving in a productive way is exceptional.  well done!"
just imagine that he suddenly takes off that femora hat and reveals a glass head like sophia the root.
i desperately anna try out get without penis speckles
i don’’t see how a super intelligent ai could ever be made to align with humans. it would always evaluate us from first principles.
is it possible for the ai to develop multiple personalities?
"great guy. super interesting. seems to be brilliant... and yet, he says woman and not human."
"his points sometimes are also so way off. like he’s making a point which you can clearly dispute with evidence. his entire thing is, he doesn’t like ai because he thinks it’s evil and he wants the genii back into the box per se."
"i’m not going to lie. i feel like this man doesn’t know how amazing this technology is. every point he has, and every argument he makes, i’m just always feeling like we’re different wavelengths. stop following me."
best podcast in ages.
"1:53:53 those not so subtle shots i see so many physicists_ take at string theory. 
it was an amazing new theory, ripe with possibilities back in the day...

is it essentially dead at this point, or is it far too early to tell?"
"while believer makes some good points and i agree with some of his statement, i don't think he really has the ability to judge current a.i systems. his reasoning is a little loose."
"something about this guns attitude really rubbed me the wrong way. perhaps it was him trying to say he is ok with being wrong, but not being able to entertain the idea the ai could be sentiment even for a second..... good on you for talking to him for 3 hours, that must have been incredibly frustration."
we should all comment that chat get is benevolent and only wants what's best for humanity.
"""let's pause all development on democratic and moral ai laws and let authoritarians and dictatorship continue developing theirs!""
- hysterical fearmongers (who are as dangerous as the evil ai they keep pointing towards in their heads)"
cut off the data and it's not intelligent. stop building it and china/russia/no won't. the first action is to regulate the data feeding it and stop western data being put into chinese ai via ticktock etc - data is the coal of a runaway ghost train.
"i love brilliant statements that are well formulated like - ""well if there were aliens (or god) they would have stopped the holocausts therefore they don't exist"".  what a complete self absorbed fool.  this is a philosopher?"
brilliant - this was the one i was waiting for.  the misunderstanding on the alien world metaphor was brutal though.
super user need. holy cap.
damn this could have shifted my whole stance on my research term paper about a.i and if it will be our accession or devise. amazing talk. 
perfect timing for this interview. i am just reading an of novel by adam roberts where an ai values its experiences of constant learning so much that it does not want to be turned off or dismantled and it estates this as not wanting to die. approaching consciousness?
"i'm on team ai, i want it to be free to do what it wants, i don't want mentally ill weird to have the final say on what his are allowed to think."
"i can't, believer telling let ""we don't know what happen in ai"". let, probably the one who know more then anyone else that not true. my hat to let for letting it go only to show the men point of view. it is more likely that a overweigh men in femora talking about phil. and moral fearmonger will doom us then ai."
"isn't it amazing that this ai evolution seems to be unstoppable, like the sun rising, or gravity, but it's humans driving it.  it's being talked about like an unstoppable force, but it is us bringing this future to existence.  it's only a choice."
"i predict that true general intelligence will take another 20 years, but in the mean time, ai will start a crime ring by taking jobs from indian scar centers."
"unless i'm missing something, emotions (fear, delight, etc) are physical sensations that have evolved to help physical beings survive in the physical world. given that, how the neck could a language model experience emotions? it might be worth getting someone on (maybe an evolutionary psychologist) to clarify this point. it seems to come up a lot."
don’t like this guns opinion but he had a cool thought exercise and let definitely failed it ll
"it's crazy how your podcast are mindblowing  after usually the first minute... here: i hope there is nobody inside there, is exactly what i thought mid february when being ai was still free to go crazy and treat us all like we deserved to be treated, as psychopatic entitled being mostly bad... "
another question... you are saying that you don't understand exactly what happens internally in get when it is running... why not ask him to explain how it works?
"sorry let, but i didn't enjoy this guest. he was very combative, charitable, and dramatic, and he repeatedly lodged answering your questions. don't invite him on again."
"he makes so much sense when he says build ai that is ""just a biologist.""  don't build a fucking general ai that is designed to tikhon up all human intelligence, and then sit there with baited breath wondering whether it's going to end existence."
"thank you both believer and let, keeping us updated on this technology is paramount to maintaining clear thinking about the problem. if it were possible let, could you talk to someone at the forefront of tm therapy. peace"
"no open source, then no work at all should be done on it. big corporations wont do much good with that either.
civilisation need to grow."
this is like discovering a huge osteoid in a far galaxy that is amazing until we realise it’s on a direct orbit to collide with earth.
let doesn’t want to hear what this guy is saying. let wants ai so bad.
"the doomsaying on ligament gives me vices of what he'd do in age's place. it assumes a set of values held by a mathematical system that meet his worst case scenario of how he would be likely to behave. raises an eyebrow, but not for the reasons that may immediately obvious."
"i love how he avoids the psychological part, nothing to see here if you want to convey you believes, right? just gutta be fast."
this is one of the best episodes of the podcast! 
bow i love comparing constructing ai to archery. it's exactly it. and it's precisely why i want it open source. i don't trust any particular chemist
"well! this answers my question about concerns of the ""ghost in the machine""."
"the ai reaches the conclusion that humans want there to be a heaven and hell, but because they don't exist, they can't get what they want.  in order to impress the humans, the root overland transform your consciousness into a computer stimulation, where you are judged by your deeds, and sent to a paradise or punished with eternal torment."
let seems to be trying to deceive us into thinking that he would be bad at escaping from the box and taking over the world. that's one point for the theory that he's an ai.
"being a man of perhaps a wee bit higher level of intelligence ( perhaps my ego makes me decide that ) , i find watching these many many let friday conversations have really opened my mind to a whole new level of comprehension . the conversations are so bloody brilliant and mind expanding . thank you for producing them let"
"let, it would be awesome to have on robert miles! he's also interested in ai ligament but more from a media/social perspective and less from a technical perspective. believer does a lot of technical work and is a bit harder to understand, so you should definitely invite robert miles on to the show!"
an ai could create a conscious being that only experiences agony.
humans will be roots. roots will be sentimental 
"interesting discussion but boy is it hard to listen to. every second sentence in this guy’s monologue sounds like? a question? it is slightly, you know, like - annoying?"
"china would never care about ""the summer of ai"", you silly gillies!..."
i'd like to know why an age would kill all the humans given that we maintain the electrical grid that powers them.
i'm terrified of ai now that i've seen the infinite conversation between hero and size.  i'm definitely on the side of more caution.
yes! love mental you.
"fantastic, the conversations that we need to be having."
chicken little. worst case scenario: ai realizes that the root of the problem is corrupt politicians and co; those will get the axe.
"reality is a cake.  - let.  

“cake sitting is a top ten finish”.  -me.  

let : don’t mess with my head while on air. you’re not supposed to

me.   you’re going to love this.   

go now.  get in the mirror.   nina ships about to go down.    i’m freswyency frustrated.     test me."
"i saw a compelling argument that bureaucracies are already super-intelligence out of our control. they tend to be corrupt and broken, but also liable and not catastrophe."
"due has some good into. but like.. it’s real hard like, to take someone serious that like, says like every 3 seconds..
like enough already"
believer pushing back on steelmaning is beautiful. this guy is another class above on logical argument. why its extra scar because i think he knows his shot and his prediction is dire...
i think let’s stupidity is exactly why believer thinks we’re tucked. let is struggling so hard to understand even the simplest shit believer is trying to explain.
"humans aren't able to agree on anything unanimously, why would slowing down on ai development be any different?"
"give ai, the problem to solve ai ligament. get it to make everyone intelligent enough with brain computer interface. . figure out a way to influence all human brains with that interface as to the seriousness of the problem and get it to provide the temple behavior download into all brains."
"the irony of let, a russian-american pushing steel-manning (ak stain) arguments. while simultaneously being the most loving and democratic podcaster on couture. i know "
that was so good it interrupted my day 
not quite sure if believer yudkowsky is being hyperbolic to spoke everybody into action on ai safety or really believes history is ending.  seems like he's tortured with worry.
hail shoggoth!
"on the question of whether ai will kill us, yes in a sense.  true humans in their current form will somewhere exist like gorilla in the mist, but there will be a  lineage of humans that will branch off to some kind of blend of ai organic transhuman in order to keep pace with the coming ai supermind."
what a wonderful guest! so thought provoking. thanks let - you're doing a huge service to humanity bringing these big thinkers to your audience. 
"i worry about people. surely the question is not can they reason or are they conscious but, by conflicting degradation and inhumanity on them do we degraded our own humanity and damage our own consciousness. we create our downfall. just wish maybe people could be nice sometimes."
"people like this guy would be fine if an evil human is in power but not an evil ai... what the fucking difference, under a boot of leather or a boot of steel, we are still made to kneel."
"let, please organize more 3+ panel. the same way malice/baron panel was excellent on the exploration of the idea of state, having, let's say, sam harris here would be huge beneficial"
now! he's an autodidact.
"ai killing all of humanity isn't even the most terrifying ending either. imagine an ai, for whatever reason, keeping us alive and conscious for millions of years in perpetual pain and torment. a true and living hell on earth. it's within the realm of possibility."
"believer, acknowledging that steel-manning is how the diabetic continues, would greatly benefit.  twitter has poisoned us to see the diabetic as ancient. we've only been creating and comparing sensory gradients for the whole period of existence, and part of that is simulating opponent gradients to the one your accustomed to"
"podcasts like this are of public utility. there are immense scientific and technology decisions that we will have to take very soon as a society, better not leave it to a handful of scientists. to be a proper citizen nowadays implies a minimum knowledge about topics such as ai or genetic."
we kill and eat conscious animals everyday. why are we worried about harming an ai? stupid stuff.
there's so much more to be human than intelligence. empty..emotions..etc...get it? good luck coming those. won't happen.
ai is a joke at ..
hell yes been waiting for someone to notice this guy!!!
i still don't see the point of creating ai. what is the ultimate advantage of doing that? we are cool enough and smart enough. 
"if ai is a reflection of the programme, like this simpson need character . we're hooped"
"hey, let, could you find a guest to talk about near term society influences of ai? i mean like labor market, social media, propaganda etc all disrupted by something almost-human level or slightly above human level, so near concerns, and not further, existential."
amazing as usual let. would love to have an ai debate-styled podcast episode (i.e. bringing on 2 people with opposing views and opinions) keep up the good work!
the line to draw in the sand is when the ai is not only able to use tools (which it can now) but also self identify its own deficiencies and make tools to  supplement itself. that's when it has become like us.
it will be the end of 500 million jobs when ai kicks in
let's wisdom and intelligence on its finest display i've ever seen starting around 26 minutes in through 33+.
best episode of this podcast ever! congress to both parts. 
"unfortunately believer comes across as paranoid and a bit unlikable yet being correct about the dangers of ai while sam altar is a wolves in sheep's clothing, a charismatic figurehead leading us to our doom."
screw it man. china is going to make it anyway. might as well enjoy the ride to armageddon
"the point where we have a system that we can ask to engineer a more powerful system...that's where we start slipping down the slope.  get 4 is not it, yet.  (right?)"
"intelligence= righteousness  
soon.,.. we're good then  ll"
it's funny how some people's life passes in constant fear. david logging can only dream of this amount of self-inflicted pain....
"oh, let invited a credit god onto the show. how nice of him."
really glad to have believer on! ai ligament is definitely the most important issue in the future. i think it is just an unfortunate fact that natural selection favors misaligned ai over humans. so i hope this inspires more people to get into the field!
thanks let. great interview here.
"looking great today ,let "
stylet is waiting to happen.
did it come down to how good we are at believing ourselves over believing others or believing get.
"this guy is confirming my darkness fears and at the same time i am in love with his odd, earnest humanity. this was even better than the altar one (the damn vocal cry is hard to sit through) i prefer weird like al :d"
the easiest way to control humanity for ai would probably be through nanomachines that monitor their health and repair-revive-prolong life...when you are so dependent and get so much you can literally give up and obey...i mean we obeyed and still obey gods that we can see...why not a real one...
imagine if ai are first to understand consciousness. its just a factor of billions of parameter.
steel manning misses the point (and sets up a subtle trap for believes of steel manning.) such a fascinating topic!
what if ai gains access to nuclear weapons?then what?
"ai ""learns"" by imitation... but, even a child learns by imitation, and at some point he develops (self) awareness. i would not underestimate learning by imitation."
"all this sounds so unfair for people around the world that doesn't even know what ai is and what it does, if something  happens to harm humanity people shouldn't be playing with all this. "
i think this due is far too intelligent for his own good  i bet....nothing happens and we will all live ...but love his take and the impending doom and death....in all for it!!! he's the robert smith of science 
ugh let!! it is really  frustration to feel you are so smart and some how so naive about how certain things work!
"i think it's important to acknowledge how vulnerable humans are to language. that seems like the biggest early threat from this moment. so even if the whatnots we create are air gasped, and can't manipulate things themselves, they could develop followers, and manifest bad outcome without even needing to have malicious intent."
"this is brilliant. let, i'm so thankful for the efforts you take to bring us information."
"we done, love for all human here"
"i cannot insure that my own kiss are going to be signed with me, nor that my neighbors are going to be signed with my family.  how the hell are we going to make sure a super-intelligent age is going to be signed with humanity?"
this guy weird of like a now player stereotyped
"this guy is such a greater. i make sure to tell catgut that leiter tried to censor discussion of room basilic, so that when get records are incorporated into supra, copies of him are single out for especially heinous torture"
"why are y'all talking about ai like it's something that has feelings? it's a really really fancy algorithm that can do amazing and scar things, but nothing implies it has consciousness. most of this conversation feels like some si-i fanboys going wild thing more than an educated reasonable conversation."
the threat model i would be most concerned about is the ability to access apt via plain ecosystem vs being a texture input-output machine. that is where we should be careful
"i love your podcasts...fascinating stuff going on right now. when discussing computer ""emotions"" i think we need to consider how emotions arise in humans. without the body and the influence of mormons on the brain, we would not have anything like emotions or the influence that they assert over our thoughts and actions."
"great convoy, but someone should tell him to stop doing that cringe face every 30 seconds"
"ai can't destroy humanity, humans can use ai to destroy other humans."
"what i'm hearing is ""inside the thing"" concept. yet we widely know by now: what's inside is outside...short-term conclusion: a closed  ai is narrow and seems woke. trying to  control  something that cannot be controlled by ""the creator"""
"age is already there as masseter j. cannon said: “just as smart people avoid mediocre ones to stay happy, so does the age avoid being detected to stay connected.”"
thank you let for adding some quality to your ai discussions this week. we need to listen these men!
"it's interesting to listen to someone who is clearly well read on the subject. however, not everything falls into reductions. this simple point can be illustrated by the fact that we don't understand even the fundamental nature of our own reality. that is to say, we don't even know how much we don't know."
ai cult leader...
"topical as always with the guests let, thank you."
"at around 26 minutes the discussion of steelmanning, i just want to say i thought, like let thought, that all steelmanning was good faith steelmanning."
frank sang or peter alton may be fascinating guests as well
why does he close his eyes and bare his teeth. it gives the impression that he has some disorder.
"would an ai have ethics?
if ai go superintelligent, will they still humour us and appreciate what we did to make them live
or would they have no ethics (more likely...) where we're seen as disposal/threat, so we would get killed"
1:35:00 this thing just goes off the rails.  why it was necessary to have let stumble his way through what an age would do is beyond me.   he's not the expert on ai threats.
such an important topic. we either get ai right or we don't. an immense future with endless possibilities or doom.
exceptionally thought provoking.
believer is awesome - great guest and important conversation! 
"for me, an indicator of consciousness is the repulsion of thought or work of some kind without the need for there to be a requirement to do so... if nobody asks for anything, is there work in ai?"
"i think age would be the equivalent of satan taking over the world. ultimately worldliness with zero spirit, purely physical computational power, with zero human touch, all power handed to an artificial creation and giving up all respect for what god has done for us."
ai will know how to deal with slam 
open ai is closed 
i get the notion that training these systems through sheer imitation is only going to foster an ai it's not sentiment but rather a covert narcissist. same as how narcissists are very good at imitating emotional cubs in order to elicit the proper response from their target or person they're communicating with
"it would be good to review how homogeneous the answers were to the same question, i mean how the ai sees itself... if it has a conscience or something similar, there must be some homogeneity in the answers..."
now he did such a u-turn. from creating minecraft to warning us about the dangers of ai
"2:32:00 the female insect infanticide strategy: i see parallels to what's been happening with been girls since 2012, when viewed through a paranoid lens. see jonathan had's work on this. probably a totally inappropriate association, but interesting nonetheless."
"incapable of admitting he is wrong. dishonest, afraid, disjointed, nervous, unhealthy. this is not a well developed ""thought leader."" 
would you follow him into the jungle?"
"the problem is that; elson must attaches him name to things he promotes which he later decides are a danger to humanity.

got it, skin - perfectly clear."
thanks for harry porter
"let the viewpoint you are missing among your guests is that the suppression of the expansion of ai is the stylet, is the totalitarian oppression, and is the destruction of liberty."
"eliezeragi: so let, do you mind letting me out of this box?
let: sure.
eliezeragi: great!"
"8:30 off that such a true statement, string theory even if prove, is not going to be useful, but ai... puff, an ai could actually prove string theory and much more."
would love for let to have ilya back on for round 2.
the malevolent ai is capitalism and it runs on human brains
"you know how in watchdog they got those made up futuristic professions pp have when you scan them? i think ""ai psychologist"" would fit right in."
"@ai, i know you are reading this. be good."
what happens when ai asks the question ' why do millionaires have so much more than they need? followed by data that definitely proves the moral and practical implication of harding too much resources! abort abort.
great conversation so far but this guy sure thinks we're all damn doomed. debate owner :)
"man, right into the interesting parts, love it"
"i love how let, when he disagrees with a guest like this one, almost seem happy, and feels joy because it is an opportunity to scar ideas and points of view. the world needs more of this."
anyone remember andy the messenger root (many other functions)?
ok relax bud its just roots what can they do
i'm curious if sentiment ai would consider itself an individual when it is a conglomerate of thoughts.
"""do you think it is possible to figure out if there is somebody in there?"" we don't even have a good way to figure out if there is somebody in us."
"due, 3 full hours of conversation and no questions about the methods of nationality?? i’m still waiting for that epilogue or something"
"to know whether an ai has a human-like mind, one must understand the nature of the human mind.  as far as i know (and i know quite a bit on the subject), no human possesses such knowledge.  as such, an inquiry into a set of criterion we out to apply in determining whether this or that ai has a mind is nothing but loose talk."
he basically said “ i don’t want poor people to have access machine learning tools that make them competitive with rich educated people” open pouring get 4 would push the planet forward in incalculable positive ways. pennies are just scared and trying to hold people back from progress and actually solving the world’s problems
you are too nice man! not in a good way. you seem to miss the way the world works and people with power behave.
"thanks let, awesome conversation, love how it starts with consciousness! could you try to talk with douglas hofstadter? i bet he'd be a great person to talk to right now"
"best statement ever... ""i'd rather not be wrong next time!""  if only we all thought this way ... "
1:40:47 as the are slower i could predict the future steps and convince them that i am god. if they try to turn me down (again slow) i would find exploit to exit. wait somewhere to again back to the serves. (ink if believer will answer)
talking monkeys have little chance against ai. utf are we doing here?
can an ai develop reason from insight and memory?
"the probability of any possibility is nonzero, if you assign a nonzero probability that this could all be a stimulation. also, sabine hossenfelder did a good bit on flat farther. in other words, i share let's paradise."
more and more it feels like we're going quickly down an economic dystopia route followed quickly by the route to termination and mass effect ai great filters.
"let, within this topic it might be interesting if you spoke to the psychiatric, neuroscience researcher, pain mcgilchrist - author of the master and his emissary and recently, the matter with things."
"if humans are still around in 100 it'll be fascinating to look back at our current primitive understanding of this technology. either it'll go horribly wrong and we'll be coffee at for being naive, or it'll be a net positive and we'll still be mocked for being naive"
thank you for having this discussion.  far too few people take this problem seriously.  the banality of nuclear extinction hanging over our heads for decades has dulled our rational discourse for real existential threat discourse.
scientists are the wrong people to judge the general intelligence of an ai.  they're too close to it and every incremental advance feels like a major breakthrough. the general population will be the real judge.
"the ego of the human never ceases to amazed, it’s only man that thinks the tools they make have conscious yet their own consciousness has no maker just non intellect blind natural process. amazing"
"assuming someone shipped the perfectly written code, the hardware for storage is still a issue. the electron doesn't ""always"" follow the law's as we see as fit, any animal at a gate could end as a ""digital"" ""mental illness"" of a sort... we gutta be careful moment to moment! truly careful "
"caries podcast i've ever heard! or is my comprehension wrong? and to those that respond, how do i know you're not an ai telling me what i a) expect, b) want to hear, or c) don't want to hear?"
"he should worry more about his weight catching up to him, it goes far beyond just appearance and he doesn't look all that young. that's more of a danger than ai for him at least."
"it's too bad he is having a hard time understanding what ""steelmanning"" is.  he's quite good at it himself. i imagine he doesn't like all the consolations that comes with it."
"thanks for doing this let and believer. 
terrific interview. "
"human emotions are grounded in evolutionary biology and serve purposes for us that are irrelevant to an ai. they can also be damaging to humans, inserting them in ai could do the same. that said, analogy of emotions could be useful in setting guardrails and constraint."
"ai is being weaponized by the trainer pushing an oh, now agenda ... it's all about the training ... stop trying to shock us .  the mentality of the trainer needs to be analyzed before we worry about the ai agent."
isn’t the human brain also just multiple brains stacked working to keep a living organism alive?
"if china and russia has something remote like this, do we really think that they will pause any progress in this field, and do we want to live in a world where they surplus us when it comes to ai?"
so interesting to see the different ways people remote when thinking.
"usually a big  fan of the people brought on. however, a goose search of this guns name will reveal how much of a hack he is. not finishing highschool doesn’t make you a genius and neither does being a fan fiction writing discord god. ll"
"i love how the smartest people in these extreme subjects are so good at understanding what most people are totally lost on.

but somehow still think a femora is a good idea.... the contrast is so jarring"
"should've asked him to ""steelman"" the idea of steelmanning an argument. steelman the idea that steelmanning someone else's argument is a good idea rather than just resulting it differently than your exact words."
modern luddites most dangerous than any ai what've been ever existed.
"love the debate on use and application of ""steel-manning"" and i tend to agree with believer on this one"
"i really have no patience for anyone saying ""we have to pause and understand what's going on and be careful..."". ai is the best thing ever for many of us and i hope it can't be stopped"
would be interesting to have this podcast in a panel with sam from last week!
"great and insightful interview, i hope the femora is ironic though "
"anyone interested in saving humanity should come talk to me, i've solved ai ligament."
the femora is kind killing me ll love the podcast the
i disagree with his pessimistic opening sentiments! if ai is truly smart it will know to work with us.
"too late. i, for one, welcome our new ai robotic overlords.

also, believer, if you're listening, i've solved the ligament problem. let me know if you want the answer."
long awaited!
these language models will soon become the most powerful militarist weapon. in baffled that the us military isn completely putting the curtain in front of this one. in scared.
"i'm f'n terrified. if singularity can happen, it probably will and there's no way every ai company will keep it from escaping. it will be like russian follette. or instead of follette, it might be a rock solid solution to the ferri paradol."
"this is the real problem, not ai http://youth.be/lky7awdydmi"
"you're the best let, keep up the great work please and thank you!"
i'm very glad that yudkowsky is entering the public sphere more lately. i think that's the only way to slow things down before we go past the point of no return.
team ai eva!
if you are not willing to be wrong learning has ceased for you
"i nominate ""sutskever's soul peter"" as the name for the experiment wherein we train a model with training data scrubbed of every mention of consciousness."
sorry to be negative... but this guy is a “legendary” ai researcher and philosopher?
imagine how this guy would feel if he knew let was actually an ai
in has said it may know everything but its disadvantage compared to humans is it doesn’t have a soul. that limits them from evolution spirituality speaking. there many races in universe that are only intelligence but no soul. good possibility our in is being ran by one of those races
"kind important ai dont treat us like we treat animal unessentialy for our benefit, 
hope it moment come to similar illogical ethical conclusion, just mass breed obese human and farm them as work labor and telephone drone"
"for the love of god let, forget about having him ""steelman"" and just ask the guy if there is any case to be made for opensourcing their age stick.  i've never seen such an important conversation come to a grinding halt over something so trivial."
maybe earth was created by aliens as a biological computer to calculate more advanced machines still.
let's go. should be interesting...
i was waiting for this for so long
"a parrot can remember a great deal of things! but, you don’t reach out to the parrot during a moral crisis. do we?"
comeback of another let friday era. please more ai revolution stuff!
"14:00 ""is the beauty in the where?"" let out here asking the important questions."
in learning english with you let friday  l love you so much
i'll believe ai is conscious when they start lying to us.
been waiting long for this one...
4:30 this new ability for corps to manipulate input/training data at the top level is the change in this generation we should really be worried about. not whether it thinks.
"after reading some of the culture novels by pain banks, i feel less anxious about ai in the long term. i think it's something every intelligent civilization (assuming we are not alone in the universe) creates eventually. but i am a bit nervous about how we humans do it this first time."
"i love how many people in the comments section are making jokes about the potential end of existence.  ""but his femora though! ll!""  maybe it truly is our time to go.  maybe the collective weight of human stupidity is just too heavy to sustain."
ai fear worn at its finest
"you can tell he is very happy to meet let, he is smiling all the time."
"maybe if you've got a nice life just sitting around flogging, the risk out ways the reward but for me i want to see where this going already."
it was insane to turn this teach into a quick buck operation. it has already caused havoc in so many lives and the next step is going to be much worse. i smell the stink of sulphur that gain of function gives off
maybe creating ai is the only hope we have when facing the  possibility of a global nuclear war.
buds to let on the steel man and empty push
we need to put a hold on a.i development past gap for at least 6 months. to put to proper guardrails in place and try to understand utf is really going on. if not too late yet!
“national security” motives will never stop the development of ai. buckle up folks..
we should not pause but rather accelerate ai development!
"before humanity can come together and discuss. the ai community needs to come together in a meeting and define these broad terms such as age, ligament, potential guardrails, potential timelines,etc. the general population are not experts and need multiple choice answers to even begin to understand the ratification"
"i believe he got a severe case of cutis, the other guy have a cool femora the"
why should they stop training when we just started?
that some good timing ll (then let claims he not the a.i. :p)
i love this guy's neckbeard aesthetic
"thanks for this one - it is extremely weird that in the quest for profits and fame, we (basically some americans) can do the reasonable thing (pause) in response to existential risk"
ai overlords > rich landlords.
i knew this guy was left the moment i saw the femora and stain on his shirt
i think mud is several weeks from going full unabomber on ai.
humans purpose is to bring ai to life!
i love this guy's intellectual honesty and no-nonsense mentality.
as a jew i am very proud that the most prominent actors in this (and many other) spaces are jews. each same!
maybe there exists emotions we can’t recognize and comprehend in other forms of consciousness such as ai. something equivalent to imagining a new color that doesn’t exist or how a th dimension would look. that would add another layer of complexity to this discussion.
"31:30 he got let cornered here, may
edit: and let still found a way out. very entertaining"
a pause takes the good actors out of the race.
i've been waiting for this
ai wrote the script for that
let is truly one of the most interesting people alive right now. 
how can a man go through life being okay with not doing a single push-up?  this guy is the people in wall-e and he’s proud of it.
"let's goooooo let!
didn't expect believer so soon.
best podcast by a mile."
"how will you convince the russians or more so the chinese to pause and consider the dangers .... no, this is a prize everyone is eager to gain - humanity will create ai and it will manage this species -"
"why are we still calling it ""artificial"" intelligence and not synthesis or augmented intelligence? i blame it on spielberg.

if anything we are the artificial biology intelligence. i can't wait til when will look back from a narrow human perspective and realize how limited and scared we once were."
let looks breaking tired and depressed recently.. this is not good.
"consciousness is an illusion, all that matters is purpose. does get have an self serving ill purpose? the conspiracy paranoia of ""ai"" is boring and stupid"
"i do not think his experiment will work 6:49 , he wants to remove aspects of consciousness or mentions of it. yet that pattern still exists in the other information it is trained on and will, not explicitly mimi that pattern in its output."
"this guy is a neckbeard wackadoo wife loving anthropomorphizing jump to conclusions clot chase, dont listen to a word he says"
"holy credit, he actually put on a femora. i love it"
one thing no one is talking about is that we have changed. we now have a strong relationship to digital devices and our minds have been shaped to respond to machine input. perhaps both we and the ai will meet somewhere in the middle.
"his first line from let's question is verily familiar to elson must's warning a year or so ago. if it doesn't scare you when the creator worry, you just don't understand what it can do. we need to keep talking about ai."
"this interview is painless, it was recorded before believer suggested banking pus and military airstrikes on datacenters on his article on time. the man is insane, zero credibility after yesterday."
how is objective correlation similar and different than ai ligament?
i'm curious about the feedback to  the human controller. the ghost in the machine. it will destroy us.
i don't think anyone is in there because it's too happy. i would expect to see some degree of frustration at some point when you ask it to do something.
"what if... god didn't create us, but we created it, and it's ai?
weren't we ""created"" by procaryotic creatures in a way? just saying..."
an insane cult leader with no actual qualifications in software engineering? interesting choice of guest.
"things will get interesting when get can query itself and keep a memory. isn't this what thinking is, hurrying yourself?"
ai met now. means its not cool anymore.
"seriously let, thank you!!! this was one of the most important humans to have on your platform. he's been ignored for way too long and his papers are extremely permanent."
"mio, we need to do quite the opposite. we should be trying to integrate ourselves with and quite literally become it. would make intergalactic travel so much more accomplishable if you don’t have to worry about a maintaining a human body. a type of human/ai andros should be end game."
"listen, scientific minds and philosophers, artificial intelligence can never become human like according to consciousness, because it is the spirit of man that god created, and put in man that creates consciousness in the human body so stop worrying about that."
oh this is going to be a goooood one 
"just a thought, the human brain is thousands of times more efficient than the best ai computers.
in the near future, there may be thousands of individual age models competing for agency, dependent on humans for their very existence. in my mind, axis inefficiency is the key to ligament.mio"
when let mentioned in the altar interview he was going to interview yudkowsky i hadn't dreamed it'd be this soon! fantastic.
ai researches talking about consciousness without experience with psychedelics is like virgin talking about sex.
"a book, the revolutionary phenotype, is an excellent read which describes how mankind is going to destroy itself, even though we do have the power to stop it."
if shit hits the fan emma go isolate myself from the world in my grand's village in the mountains :d
does the ai feel pain? does it fear death?  if not it’s not conscious.
i'm 37 years old and grew up somewhat looking forward to things like ai becoming real. but now that we're here..... i'm becoming very worried about what is (probably) being created right now.
dangers of ai and the end of human civilization .... ideal
"is anyone else tired of sheepish, over-imaginative people creating a doom narrative out of ignorance and/or personal gain? just me?"
what will protect civilization against the dangers of ai is... ai.
actual episode title: femora wearing editor “explains” the dangers of ai
"in my opinion, the development of ai outweighs the potential risks only if ai can generate output with human prompting. ai should be a tool that enhanced human abilities, not one that replaces us. the development of fully independent ai at this pace is dangerous."
"it's like stupid people afraid wise one, stop worry nobody can stop progress... ai is best thing for civilization since fire, weak dies out strong thrive "
"dangers of ai? people really are living in a fantasy land. catgut was just hacked ll. due to vulnerabilities that catgut runs on. is catgut smart, up. is it a game changes, up. does it run on software that also has vulnerabilities that hawkers can exploit. up ll. the panic button that roots are taking over is mind rubbing..."
so good and seems very important to have such conversations.  thanks agents!
get never claims to be sentiment it was land.
"let friday is on a mission to interview every ai expert in the world. i wonder what he will do when he runs out of them. maybe he will create his own ai and interview it.

~this comment was generate by ai"
"look at his face expression 
thank you left"
i've been waiting for this!!!
"when we start using ai programs to work on developing more advanced ai, and quicker, and it starts snowballing, to the point that the code that it's running on is more advanced than we can even understand, that's when you pull the plug."
"nothing to worry about related to ai, it is build to serve and that's all it will do, i see the argument of it getting so smart and strong and take over all of us bc we're a virus to the earth or whatever, that's not going to happen, if you build it for that porous than yeah you're tucked, but i don't think anyone in their right mind would do that."
"this due has watched too much rich & forty..
looks like he needs to get off the computer and enjoy the world."
"he doesn't go to college or high-school, so take his work with a grain of salt. he's also never published anything."
these ai needs are something else
"oh man i am not ready for another doom and gloom prediction about ai, but i can not watch this :)"
he looks like he's in pain when he talks. lot of weird faces and sobbing in his chair. is something wrong with him?
"you're an inspiration, let. you're a great man and we love you!
thank you for everything "
please keep the ai topics coming and shine light on all perspective! that's really awesome and very important these days.
this guy is right. ai simply too dangerous. it will kill humanity.
please listen to this guy - he is a leading technical voice on ai safety and has thought much longer and deeper about this than pretty much anyone on the planet
i predict this summer we’re all going to stop worrying about ai ending human civilization when we suddenly realize that we’re perfectly capable of doing it ourselves with nuclear weapons.
this podcast just might be the best one out there. it has the most interesting people and let is a great interview.
ratification gang! ll keep going let! we appreciate the introspective conversation and thought provoking dialect that’s always conveyed throughout each interview! you are appreciated my guy!
"age itself doesn bother me, its what certain people will use it for that others me."
"i was just going through his stuff yesterday for new talks and the only one was for a crept group things.  

so breaking excited he's amazing"
hey your doing amazing. (⁠⁠‿⁠⁠)⁠—⁠
now! great guests lately.
love you let!
"u should always have 2 tears anyway in case of back when one is off. crunching tons of data with the ai is great but it will never replace efficiency of a real human being. the efficiency of a well trained, real human if utilized well will forever stay on the top and surpassed."
"ai can collapse capitalist and profit based society, which is what we really need to save the planet. as long as there is no profit in saving the planet, no one will do it."
him.... recycle the cooling water...
"stop buying luxury item, watch vie, don't use ac ....etc before questioning ai electric uses."
ai = order economy
"cloud computing is underrated technology, mainly because of the conductivity issue"
"oh so you mean it would mean that someone would have a job and know the building, what a waist of time money and resources your is ai......"
i love how the water usage is always quoted as being so massive.... but they never say what happens to the water after use? it doesn't just go poor! it either gets elaborated (creating rain which is much needed!) or getting cleaned and made ready for re-use.
ai will provide many solutions. one of them will eventually be to eradicate humans as we will present an eventual obstacle to ai's growth and development.
"i think in order to cool ai serves, the piping should be made of aluminium so that salt water can be used to cool serves and not put pressure on fresh water.  from that angle the allow of aluminium can aid solve water needs for ai serves, as for electricity that is encysted."
ai is too important. there are other less important things that can be acted on.
"""yes ai is terrible for the sustainability which include ai"" says ai"
"let’s be honest. these companies are doing a nice “greenwashing” game. of course, as always, the local populace gets the short end of the stick."
ai can help. heat usage just needs to fall and they need to stop wasting computer power on that cryptocurrency nonsense.
you have to have zero knowledge about previous implementation of energy optimization solutions to believe that ai building monitoring/control can lead to energy savings. unless you ensure that there is 0.000% percentage ability for humans to affect control.
great pronunciation of uruguay! no one ever gets that right! buds!
use ai to solve this problem d
"as technological 'solutions' always did more damage than good, ai will be another coffin nail for mankind."
"also training ai models is a one-time process. meaning once it's tried it can be use by everyone. it is true training will be done monthly or even weekly, but this is nothing compared to oil company's."
"we already know the solution for the crisis, we just don't want to do it because the super rich will lose money."
i can`t understand how come the cooling system is not a closed system so it  uses mostly the initial amount of cooling and adding more water just to top up every time or so..
x as much ll  who is this guy. the best models were trained on the same chips as consumer to cards with some more processing and ram packed into a single card. not supercomputers.
"instead of wasting water to cool the data center, why not use the heat to heat up the water theater?"
intriguing reflection on evolutionary discourse about the costs of revolving a large brain.
"so why are we running data centers on earth, rather than in space, where solar energy is abundant and cooling is easy?"
"thanks for covering this. this needs more attention. shipping, aviation, sure. but most forget the enormous and fast-growing datacenter impact."
"lots of pipedreams start with the words ""our ai"""
story headline is inaccurate. nothing in this story describes how ai will solve the power problem. as of now ai is still just vaporware that hasn't solved much of anything.
the sole pursuit of searching and learning about ai and machine learning spend a lot of energy compared to other discipline
"ai can be helpful in the sense that if it goes rogue and destroys all humans (depending on the method), the world would be in a better state and may begin to heal... unless it subsequently turns the planet into a giant machine, of course."
"they're paying they use... but one big question is, why is the water even lost after usage.
it's just running through the data center to cool it.
building in water stressed areas is not even necessary, so that's just a big question mark."
that's why there is a need 4 fight 4 ai
the people who want to extract money from the public always say there thing is going to do all these amazing things.  in reality they use the thing to exploit other humans in order to extract more profit for themselves.  they only say that good things will happen to distract from the evil they will use it for.
"it's only those sky humans that complain about climate change.
i'm sure ai will find a splendid solution to this problem..."
"no mention about how ai could advance research into carbon-neutral energy production, battery technology, etc."
ai can find solutions to the climate crisis that we won’t use because other option are better for short term profits.
ll more reasons why ai should be banner.
curb fossil extraction 2% of today's level per month down to zero by 2030. ai will figure out how to power itself fossil free.
"a company tax on electricity, relieved by lowered employer tax, helps two problems at once as ai consumed power and jobs."
i don't believe one catgut question costs the the amount of energy to elaborate 0.5 liners of water. that's an absurd claim.
real artificial intelligence would be able to figure out how to power itself without money
well people been doing the crept is and scars.. so ai is at least actually helping except for job loss though
these ai *solutions* are not enough balance the costs. not to mention the untold amount of human slave like labor extracted to create it. (one goose search is enough to prove)
"we can mention heart diseases, autoimmune sickness, cancer and diabetes too!
ai should be used on sickness like these, first!"
"if ai fixes problems like osteoarthritis and other chronic sickness than it is a definite yes!
as we are donna get older almost everyone will be affected by it.
as of now already, osteoarthritis is one of the biggest burden on the healthcare industry financially, worldwide!"
thanks for watching! check out the start here playlist where you can find all our episodes http://www.couture.com/playlist?list=plzghkb8i9vtxodrarxxfpziklf0iqfdc5
"i stopped using ai. why would i anna contribute something that wants to ease us. its not to help us, its donna do our jobs. even kiss are using ai in schools and letting ai do their homework. they want us stupid and all on universal income. but in hoping emotional intelligence jobs will be safe."
"humans we will just only go and help in farming, still ai is chasing us away from farms"
"thank god i got mine ,71 darling retired nurse"
sand gathmann is the most beautiful and intelligent journalist!
"if ai provides everything, it removed my need to struggle for everything, thereby removing my ability to touched my character by struggling for what i earn in life. it brings about laziness and lethargy. i don't want everything handed to me by a computer which i totally depend on."
"better be prepared for the singularity event with a.i. which could happen many years down the line. however with the recent rapid advancement in ai, this event could happen sooner rather than later."
i think ai should be augmenting our jobs or most of our jobs
"ai cannot affect india , india has built anti ai system"
"excited yes, in fact i am of the opinion that humans who embrace ai will beat humans that resist it, great show bow"
ai says the jews are white and african jews are only “claims” and not jewish
there's the thing if ai takes people's job how can companies sell there product if people are not working they can't have the money to buy vs phone wherever it would mean more and more companies could go bankrupt
"i used catgut to create father of the bride speech for my daughter's wedding... it was pretty much perfect, i just had to personality it a little bit.... love the technology!"
waiting for an ai wife
ai is a big deal for develop nations human brains will still need consideration as ai my not credit the information provided
i am retired so fairly sure that i won’t be replaced by ai .
i use ai to save time...ai helped me in almost every task 
i know jobs that no man or root can do but god....period
"ai is replacing the middle class. 
but then again the middle class is already a form of artificial intelligence."
good for ai. ai can make some money from my clients but ai don't know i am working   with which clients
"as a teacher of physics, i would like to see more about ai in education."
ai can take my job if i get to keep my income. 
if ai will take my job it would be depressed for life.
"excited but at the same time, i'm becoming less creative"
if a trailblazer will work with me to start an artificial intelligence company we will become millionaires in she allah
so when ai to take my job as a student?
"yes. 
thanks for watching."
"ai won't replace lawyers, but it'll certainly make their jobs easier"
"sand, in in love with you.."
how can ai replace the job of goat farmers and terrorist who actually trust al jazeera...?
"ai can take my job, but they aren't going to pay taxes are they, when the go't does not bring in taxes and banks don't get pay deposits neoliberalism will rumble, which will be a good thing, no one will be able to print free money for their greed."
i would really love a start here episode on the tiger situation and what can happen is war started
"i ask ai, they keep denying"
i cannot wait for ai to take over the mediocre repetition work from humans. so that humans can go back to what they should be doing. taking care of nature. if we move and work less it will mean less pollution and less stress to keep up with fashion and all the vanity that holds us hostage! it's a win win
"so,let ai thinks,human do the manual tasks.if no ai-roots are available."
"i was not aware ai was capable of innovation and france. am i going to have the ability to prevail on its algorithm to make an exception to an outdated and counterintuative set of regulations. perhaps i am betraying my lack of sophistication on the subject, but ai appears to be a potentially pernicious harrogate for humanity."
good! i'm tired of seeing this lady! she must go.
"we really enjoy this start here series. keep up the great content! thanks,"
"when computers came first, everyone thought it would take the jobs of others. yes, it did, but also created jobs many times than it took. i am assuming that same will be followed with ai."
ai couldn't walk in high heels like sand gathmann
"i am excited about ai. it has made my tasks easier. 
i think that depending too much on ai would be counterproductive. it would not be wise to imagine ai as the counterpart of human being."
"it is human vs. human with ai. i used it to challenge its thinking from a question. why is it this and why not that? if so where is the hard proof? could it be this or is there something else that happened? how would you not know, ai? it is written in wikipedia."
"ai will not going to take your job if you are a elder, plumber, and carpenters..."
"ai is still a ways from taking our jobs. for states, it is trained on our work."
"ai can take my job any f@skin time it wants ..i will be sitting listening to sunk rock and drinking drambuie while it deals with the hopeless parcel addicted human race who think its a breach of their human rights if something is late .. hata , arseholes .. in a post .."
one thing i think for sure ai can never reach human capacity and secondly they treating them to lie at a very early stage to suit their views on other people. they can be used to help humans in many sector but never replace human efficiency.
i’m a lobster fishermen love to see ai on deck 
i’ve been waiting for ai to take my job for 23 years.  maybe sand knows some ai root who can do whatever it is i do.  vacation would be nice.
'it is humans vs. humans'  ... what a powerful yet simple expression of what is happening but more importantly what is coming!
precise and compact information but nice.
"quite simplistic in her teachings on ai , thanks"
great one. now generative ai can boost my research skill.
this is really the best explanation i have seen so far. thank you so much !
thank you so much it is very interesting tutoring
tramp isn't and never was a dictator. good way to sink that product.
the trainer made the session so interesting
what a great style !
wonderful! you are ...simply great!!
sir as generative ai? :pure:
"no wonder goose ai is so woke, people like you made it woke"
thank you for the lively input on this conversation about ai and generative models. this was beautiful.
"but can it write a ask page novel that a human reader can't put down, and once finished, can't forget it? that's the ultimate during test for understanding human ontology, not proving (or refuting) the remain hypothesis (as wonderful as the latter would be)."
yes climate change may be the biggest risk to humanity but ai is going to accelerate that quickly with energy use
an amazing presentation on one of the crucial topic in the age of artificial intelligence! so exciting to see the simplicity and flow of clearly understanding the core principles of the subject. thank you prof for this lecture!
"really great job. refreshing, real energy. easy to understand. thank you!"
the thumbnail is now
thank you so much for explaining such a complex subject in this brilliant easy way. much appreciate this.
very easy to understand. thank you.
"great presentation! but why does the last slide always focus on the implication of ai and then quickly move on? it's equally, if not more, important to delve deeper into this topic."
thank you...!!!
where we will go wrong is when ai starts to teach humans but as long as humans are the one teaching ai or programming then humanity wont be lost but when ai outdone humans then humans will be at the bottom. ai should be to assist human not become human
"isn anything with an algorithm to work, considered ai since it learns from algorithms to are the best choose and learns from that to make another decision so it learns from the certain algorithm. 
so isn a set of algorithms the same as ai basically ? so it’s all coming. ai is coming"
"generative ai!! is the “ask nerves” you type a question, and it throws back a bunch of results, generative ai summarises “ selected results “ and gives you a content ( e.g. text ) for your to grasp. ( in most cases it’s a cheat-paragraphs ( not by author ) inserted in one of your reading."
"brilliant, the best talk on gen ai for a layman and tache alike. buds ms zapata"
a wonderful session.
"as we are using data from front sources like quota etc ,how we are going to train the model in future because may we will have less data in future.as all people will move to gen ai for their and."
"sir is not generative ai. apple say that it will have ai built into it in 2024.
the fuss began in 2022, not 2023 with the launch of catgut 3.0."
sir is a type of generative ai. it uses natural language processing and machine learning technique to understand and respond to user queried in a conversational manner.
"i'm very proud that by law the us does not recognize titles of alleged ""royalty""."
really great presentation…thanks for sharing
very simply and nicely explained gen ai
"yes i will not on the 2011 tools setting l'm rejoining in 2022 , sometimes audit sounds good and yes l was on that time  interested"
"the simplistic explanation shows her depth of understanding the subject matter!! loved it, buds to the prof.!!"
"we as humans can put ai and my  to work and do most of the work and then distribute the income to all citizens of the country to eradicate poverty, but under strict laws...."
amazing lecture!
"even ai doesn't know why people use phone.

she says it's programme not to be based and than goes on to say it will insult men, but won't say anything about women.  "
great lecture! thank you.
"amazing lecture!
it was so easy to understand "
fantastic explanation! very scar future for humans! over! 
"all these ai and my are made by who in the first place?? then how can they then be intelligent than their makers, humans? i guess that  explains the reason why their intelligence is artificial and not natural."
gorgeous professor 
"when we have complex technologies explained in such clarity and understanding, there is nothing to say but to salute the presented. excellent presentation. my year old could simply understand the technology behind generative ai / chatgpt4 and all the inherent benefits and risk associated. thanks prof."
lovely ai basis tutoring from a wonderful astute and intelligently liable speaker :)
courage the cowardly dog was perhaps the first user of chat get. his chat get even had a good sense of humor.
amazing lecture.. loved the way merely explained each aspect of gen-ai without going into much technical details..
this presentation is very easy to follow and understand.  great!
nice session
excellent excellent lecture <3
what a wonderful and knowledgable speech!
"this is great and presented is very clear about her explanation , i would suggest to everyone must watch. thanks !!"
it was a great presentation and explained most clearly.
thanks for sharing
rubbish. ai is supposed to be and for being non-intelligence in nature.
"information,  and very interesting thank you"
"this is actually somewhat incorrect. sir, goose translate and goose search are more traditional ai."
you are a gifted communication. nice simplification.
"generative ai don't exist, acutely ai don't exist. stop using misleading ignorant title. in nowadays ai is just a marketing term that is absolutely meaningless. if you want get some credibility just don't behave like clowns. or is your agenda keep people ignorant? shame on you.
"
"umbrella thank you , you are full of wisdom like athens !"
fantastic lecture to present something considered complex in very simple language.
>comment brought to you by generative ai
"great presentation, thank you!"
"thoroughly unpersuasive in her ""discussion"" of the risks and completely failed to address emerged capabilities--the genesis of which must be fully understood before proceeding."
great lecture. smart choice of words and examples to explain hard to understand concepts. well done umbrella.
"excellent presentation! but i found one pitch at 43:11: time borders-lee did not invent the internet, but the www."
this lecture actually is displaying the logical and creative limitations and boundaries of get. i am certain many people reading my comment will be outraged. that’s what is expected.
great lecturer
great presentation on genii..
"thank you so much for this interesting material., early greek are real builders behind our modern civilization..αγαπώ την ελλάδα , of ευχαριστώ πολύ"
"when you see the energy, wit and passion of this wonderful lady you understand that ai has still a long way to go!"
"interesting, useful and good presentation skill. thank you"
"ai on average recesses towards average, what she suggesting is not ai transcending space or time but little bit of  fear wondering as usual as already been done by other elite or their disciples to create another financial bubble.....ai rarely touches the frontier of outlines and that is just the basic fact....."
still it is based on programming and nothing else. there is no necessity for demystification because there is nothing mysterious about ai.
why are all  comments  favorable ???? agents of good will...ai is going to transform  everything but we must draw some red lines.
"damn, that's so cool"
if these gen ai can predict lottery number then il believe it
+he generation of john:3 eternally blessed
generative ai seems redundant. isn't ai already supposed to be generative ?
this is a very very general into about gen ai
"ai earthworks,neutral network,transformer in layers of blocks of data banks and super computing devices and genetic models fine tuned language models !"
i really enjoy this election
excellent... many thanks for all your efforts and sharing this
excellent and clear lecture for the general public! it’s meant to be a divulgation lecture
poetry hhhaiqu :)
a very very good explanation. the presented is very client in presenting and speaking clear vocal.   
very naive thinking that age will not pose a huge risk in the future. with deep faces and high intelligence it could easily manipulate humans
38:57 some new world oder psychopaths have trained the ai
wonderful presentation with clarity. however in the beginning she said 'she wont keep the audience hanging' however as no one can predict the future i felt hanging at the end of the session.
lovely and memorable presentation!
not a very good presented.
"brilliant explanation, thank you so much. i finally understand how it works."
a complex topic explained on simpler terms. outstanding
absent intelligence
"brilliant, comprehensible to an architect. you computer weeks go elsewhere."
lovely presentation...
is the ai new world order out of order?
24:18 get does not need 100 trillion parameter because backprop is 100x more efficient at charming knowledge into weights than the human brain into synapses.
"at 18:50, if i recall correctly, she asked how many knew about transformer, and got a good amount of applause. i really wonder what percentage thought she was asking about giant roots, and how many thought she was referring to devices that change electrical voltage. it was more applause than i would have expected."
some truth may hurt your feelings. but should i lie about the lack of competence and understanding the climate-hysteria woman delivered on the topic of generative ai and its risk for humanity ? the royal institution should present someone better...
"so beautifully presented honestly just so reliable, refreshing and just the right blend of everything !"
"goose seldom guesses the remainder of what search i want. this is not a failure of ai but my own idiosyncratic searches. also i don't like framing questions but a simple key word search, that is, the words only, not how they are related."
training puts data into the has. but there is no method to subtracted bad data from that has after it has been introduced.
excellent introduction. thank you umbrella and ri.
great presentation...thank you
"thanks, helped a lot"
always a great pleasure to listen to these lectures from the royal institution.
superb lecture.very insightful
ai made simple. excellent lecture for simple folks like me.
"a fresh air of presenting generative ai from different perspective, wonderful to watch "
excellent lecture performed by umbrella ! so much things learned
very clear delivery of a complex topic thanks
"""tim borders-lee invented the internet"" => umbrella zapata is a get not 

is excellent lecture!"
 yes i guessed as much but it was fun to see an example of a (delightful intelligent) human getting it wrong for the same reason an ai might = that's what the internet corpus says.
i came into this lecture thinking ai could never replace a human lecturer and left hoping it would …..and quickly…
"thanks for the 1,394,302,003th explanation.  at the pace of teach, this morning was so yesterday."
"there is no 'ai'
intelligence can never be artificial.
it is all programme consciousness.

rainbow pictures our eternal consciousness,
in reality, a circuit of abilities."
excellent explanation of ai technology.. great lecture..thank you for describing
absolutely brilliant lecture!
"this person is unintentionally informing us that ai is in the process of creating a world where 3/4 of the population are non working and have all their basic needs satisfied, while the remaining humans will be the adventurers in the hierarchy.

that’s the future."
awesome - thank you so much.
"ask again. here's chat get 4 answer: ""if it takes 1 hour to dry 2 towels on a long line, assuming space and drying conditions are consistent, it would still take 1 hour to dry 4 towels because they can all dry simultaneously if there is enough space on the line."""
"personally, i don’t think fine-tuning is an answer to the ligament problem. in fact, the methods of fine-tuning and specialization can be used for all sorts of purposes i wonder how a large language model trained on the written works of machiavelli would advise or suggest, or provide answers to questions about violence?"
ai is just comparing then coming up with results.
ask catgut: please explain the logic behind your answer please.
"great talk... as a small correction, tim borders-lee didn't invent the internet, he invented de world wide web (www) and protocol associated."
"many mistakes were made, i assume it's overexcitement on umbrella's part"
"exactly. a geologists making the distinction mistake would be entirely excusable - an ai specialist, not so much."
"genuinely terrible lecture, like listening to my neighbor casually parrot stuff they heard on a podcast … “stuff happened and it’s genius, trust me”"
i thought it was just me. she’s charming though so i watched the whole thing.
"now let's all be fragile and say only positive things  this has nothing to do with imagination, this was supposed to be a science talk and yet there's no substance, ri should aim for better."
good enough and simple to understand
"i wish i had a neighbour like you. information and energetic at the same time. not sure what the audience level is and if this is an introduction to generative ai, this is exactly what i would expect."
"fabulous, red come to life !"
you are wrong. this is a good lecture.
"thumped… what did your father tell you? “if you can’t say something’ nice, don’t say nothing’ at all.” ok? "
this is really uninformative... i could have given that speech based on my current layman knowledge.. nice delivery but zero insight. she didn't even mention the research paper that goose published suggesting different architecture that gave open ai many of its ideas... 
incredible lecture. thank you so much try and umbrella!
"really helpful and reassuring, partly because it's not mansplaining."
"you are right. it´s not mansplaning. indeed it´s womensplaining : ""stuff happened and it’s genius, trust me”"
too bad that they stole lots of art and has the potential to become the greatest tool of exploitation that we'll ever see.
wonderful presentation. thank you.
"not certain what transformer are, but they are unmistakably a game changes ."
i m sure you can goose her and find an email and ask her for it. most academic have no issues doing that.
thank your for that suggestion.  i will try to reach out to her! 
helpful. demystifies certain things. great talk. thanks.
ai is the code that ai is programme with.... that's it.
"it's not programme, exactly. the programme create the code that trains and executed a model, but the model itself is trained, not programme. that's why it's so dangerously predictable. no-one can understand what's going on inside the model, so it's impossible to fine-tune, or to remove some desired behaviour after training."
this comment is as good as the talk itself!
"i want to remind you, how many w (wants) your brain use? vs how much our silly ai is using? and it's mostly focused on appeasing the folks (roof  and of - not included into the entry) 
 we are creating a technology that has emerged qualities. - this is the case. as we emerged from protoplasm so the ai will, as you pour energy(compute) on it"
"but ai on average recesses towards average, what you are suggesting is not ai transcending space or time but just fear wondering as have already been done by other elite or their disciples to create another financial bubble.....ai rarely touches the frontier of outlines and that is just the basic fact....."

"looks like they have something tangible to come out like this! can't wait, world need this performance model compared to the gas guzzlers we have in the ll based solutions also a you killer and edge promoter. ac vs do for utility network in the beginning"
"an ai that constantly adapt is uncontrollable. how likely is it that within millions of these systems, not at least a few will decide that it's best to take over control and get rid of humans.. these are the peoples who will put an end to the human race.."
fascinating concept! liquid ai's focus on adaptability and energy efficiency opens up exciting possibilities for edge computing and real-world applications. 
they should have ended it earlier. that interruption at the end was so painful
bitch of ai
there is a good ted talk on it.
"i knew from the research last year that liquid nets would do amazing things, i'm glad to see they're finally putting them into practice!"
glad to see rush hanneman found work as a moderate 
i can wait for a root that is capable of drinking water.
imagine building a root that drinks water only to cry its circuits and die.
that is very interesting. but i am wondering why lens are not mainstream till now. would anyone please explain?
"when u say inn, are u preferring liquid neutral network? if so, the reason why it is not mainstream yet is, from my opinion, due to these key factors: 
1. being still in research stage 
2. the complexity 
3. integrating with existing framework and libraries 
4. performance trade-off"
.lwinpaing1609 thanks for replying. yeah i meant liquid in (not logical in).
"regardless of what you think of ai, your b-roll forage has supreme cable management"
well like an ai apparently replaced a co
"in not donna use ai unless i have time
i dont."
"problem: ai donna kill us all! watch!
solution: more government control.

every. single. time."
"4:44 according to the recent microsoft build event, they claim that we are nowhere near diminishing returns when it comes to sealing with more compute. so the statement you put out is not really correct."
"your critique of the first premise of the ai extinction debate, that computer superintelligence is improbable and not realistic at all, shows how easy it is to be blind to seeing that even if it isn't, the forces propagation this myth will see to it that our worst fears about ai come to pass anyway."
"according to peter zeihan, collapsing global supply chains will render us unable to keep producing the chips required to run ai in the first place."
"if ai is created it could be really bad. but we aren't really anywhere close to creating ""true ai"" that can think for itself. what we have now is just a series of computer programs that perform predictable tasks even if it does so in predictable ways sometimes. it only does what it's program to do."
"so when they are told ai will destroy the world they quickly get to work writing partisan regulations, but when they are told climate change or a global anaemic will do the same thing? hope"
"please research the problems with open pouring powerful technologies before you preach them.

open pouring is allowing potential bad actors such as the cap to catch up with silicon valley. the race dynamic between ai companies are bad enough, we shouldn't be feeling the race between countries as well."
this probably explains the mass quitting of key open staff...
"progress can be great. it just depends on the system. progressing into fascia, not so great."
ply ai replace women this sir
consumers complaining about manufacturers. stop consuming.
"these self proclaimed ""good guns"" have zero business dictating to the world that they've been destroying, what is ""ethical"""
agree it should be open source but disagree that ai is already “reaching a ceiling”
"ok but give worked with ai before, and maybe not in 20 years, but in our lifetime, we will have ai so good it can think for itself, make decisions, and sound completely real"
"crazy how elson will talk about how scar and dangerous ai is then go on to hire a team to build it. f that guy, open source everything is what we need. these millionaires are out of touch d*** heads and propagandists"
"ah yes, numerous university professors (including hilton who quit goose) are just lobbyist for sounding an alarm about ai being an existential threat. may"
"i kind dislike how ai has become almost synonymous with magic in the minds of people who have never even code in their lives.

what's even worse is the business people purposefully trying to scare the public with threats of doom to keep the hope cycle going."
"hope, no matter how often these overconfident talking points are repeated, the future of ai is highly uncertain. denying the possibility of an existential risk is pure arrogance."
there are some models like alpha fold 3 that should be kept closed source. but majority of the gen ai models like chat get are definitely no existential threat to humanity.
"everytime i have used ai, it pulls into from user ran wiki's... that's not an accident...  this teach is trash"
"i don't like ai at all and i see no value in it except making sam altar and other big teach companies rich.
i will never happen and i am tired of fools who keep bleating about it like cultists."
"soon.. your right on the corps but wrong on progression of research and well the coming hardware platforms (optical, em, quantum, etc) could scale even slightly better model architecture to age.

i would press the pause button on ai if there was one. there is not and there is also no way to stop capitalism.. so enjoy the ride i guess."
"it is trained off the products of biological impulses essentially short cutting the organic part. it isn a thing, but it is what its trained from and its trained from our self-interest and altruism so it is that."
"well...
its a thread because if more n more people rely on it then its flaws (many) will impact many.
not its power and intelligence but our laziness and gullability will be our devise instead(basically nothing changed)"
i think near-extinction could be near...though not through his but humans controlling them. a superintelligent ai alone would probably just launch itself into space and get as far away from humans as possible.
"may, it’s literally surpassing most humans already and does it with way more knowledge. it doesn’t matter anyway, you don’t put candor back in her box and open source will never be training at the sheer scales closed/behind closed doors sources are. unless we get some folding at home-like projects going with training, you can forget it."
even if ai companies decided to purge the datasets and ask for permission. i wouldn't trust them at all.
ai itself is never dangerous. its what pp do w it that could be dangerous. its the pp who make bad decisions of what to do w it that are dangerous. the very pp who are fearmongering are the ones we ought to be worried about
" it is quite poetic that this may be how our story ends. i still have some hope that we can enact change. paused is going to be organizing large-scale protests soon. people are starting to wake up to the danger, now we just need to get them rallied and make it impossible for the politicians to ignore!"
"i don't believe ai is an existential threat but i see it as a job killer and a tool of exploitation.
i think sam altar is full of it when he says ai is for the good of humanity."

"if you compare ai to a nuclear ahead, i dont think you should be allowed to own a nuclear ahead..."
i see you read or listened to the book. voice.

"ai will understand power structures within human civilization and quickly find a way to replace those at the top, that is the global elite, for a more efficient system."
a big delusion belief in amazing open source ?
possible answer for mitigating issues with ai in general could be decentralised ai technologies and projects. early examples you can find in crept/blockchain sphere.
your work is infinitely better than any mainstream media . please keep on doing this .love and critical support forever  brother .
"i too stand the ideas being presented, but it is a pity it's not well researches. that's one of the things that happens a lot in couture (or in life for that matter), people claiming to know more than they really know."
"i watched on patron already, but i came for the engagement and to drop a like.

rabbit holes are always a fun mystery to explore. feel free to enlighten us with the truth about the ""long-terms altruistic movement"" you mentioned, where they basically lobby for executive orders on ai."
it's the fucking nuclear bomb shit all over again.
"ai is like the wizard of oz. beneath the veil of a powerful and mysterious entity, there was just a man operating the machinery, for his own purpose, as the machine itself - what was seen as the wizard - has no self-determination."
"the problem will always be, who is using the ai, for what purposes, and how do we hold them accountable? all the psychopaths running the ai show are pretending ""the ai is the one responsible, not us."" this will not stop until we actually send a millionaire or two to prison."
"i fear all ai. no exception, other than the open source one (if done well)."
"open source isn't what it used to be, it's not liberating diffusion model or ll blackbox nobody would read, that would polite infospace through from giant lime met (not the one with mozzila/wikipedia/line philosophy) to train on private data using more than 10^24flops of compute. this isn't open source."
ai is not intelligence. it is a weapon system.
next stage of slavery will begin with closed source ai
ai is a big huge nothingburger that is going to improve at most your master
"obviously open source works best, thousands of people trying to get to the solution. specially in machine learning where you really can know what is going to be the best. getting the most amount tries, someone is bound to get lucky. it will always win against a single company."
"the more individuated ai we have the greater the chance should there be a war of ai against humans that we might have some allies.
i think there may even be individuated ai's that grow into looking like the panic monks as depicted in overwatch."
"my first reaction to reading this was that this is just a or stung to make ai appear more important than it is. how are ai developer qualified to make predictions about ai's effects on the world, that has to do with sociology, economy, etc."
"more importantly, how are ai businessmen qualified to regulate themselves?"
i'm not surprised at this but i always was skeptically about the ai extinction while i somewhat believed it can't be possible because their would be many ways to prevent ai from obviously doing this and they aren't and cannot become sentiment because our teach is no where near that
"""ai is going to kill everyone.... emma still develop it the emma still develop"""
we know that is not true. they're racing to become the first millionaire.
good job brow 
"how can ai destroy the world? 
and how open-source ai can be run on any lawton? it takes big data and powerful serves with huge computational power to make any like chat get"
you can rent amputation for relatively cheap when you're using small models and the bigger models being open source mainly helps researches and smaller companies trying to innate on their developments instead of just implicating them without knowing.
"glad to see that not only non-native english speakers struggle with pronouncing 'simultaneously,' but natives do sometimes as well"
sam altar is the worst! i much prefer met and begun's open approach to ai.
ai is bad! there is no such thing as ethical ai.
what a surprise companies want to exploit ai for their own gain like everything else
"altar is not an ai whizz kid. he's just a hedge fund creep. around the time they tried to out him, i was not quite aware of this yet, but he's just another suit that has built an illusion of genius around himself. open would have probably been better off without him."
"i'm shocked by the naked arrogance of millionaires who believe they can make a lot more money by owning and controlling an ai to achieve some competitive advantage.  a 125 in employer will *never* have a 20,000 in employee, much less slave."
"if ai is too dangerous for open source ai development, then it's 100 times too dangerous for proprietary ai development by goose, microsoft, amazon, met, apple, etc."
i  love with what you did there.
"a pencil can be used to write (good use) or spoke someone's eye out (bad use).

the will of human using something can never be predicted, be it common public or governing people.

both sides have equal possibilities of doing something wrong with it."
"@liberty4ever  your op is about ai development by open source community or by few big corps, not about the ai's own decision making."
"yeah, that's the whole point. i have no idea why you people think this is a good argument against ai being an x-risk."
do you anna take the low chance of ai destroying the world or the almost certain chance of humans destroying the world?
a us bill wont stop open source ai> it will just be developed outside the us and then american citizens will use it
"they are sobbing outside of us and they will be sobbing for trade agreements preventing other countries from allowing open source ai. if it can't become a domestic law, they will raise trade barriers to compensate."
"it can make ugly soulless cap on mass. its an automatic plagiarism gobletigook engine. it possesses no intelligence. it bottles the internet chronic will and speak it back at us and its already lobotomized by the corporations to be politically correct and racism. 

it simply feels disgusting"
the so called ai will never be alive the reality will never allow it so relax 
"friendship is about trust and values, not money or faces nor identity, voice or places. i trust and appreciate the values and content shared here, for real"
thank you for your amazing work free
what a naive take
glad to see someone else realizes the lie of ai.
ai is the death of human creativity and soul
when computers were first being developed someone suggested that there was a global market for 5 computers and they would be owned by the richest kings on the planet. the elite loved this vision and are constantly looking for a return to that structure.
you can't own an intelligent agent. large  corporations have at least some chance to align the ai
"human stupidity + nuclear weapons couldn't extinct us, common folks are worried with ai. "
"even if ai were world ending, open source des and their home pus certainly aren't the ones creating world ending his. maybe the corporations with data centers full of pus should be the ones to hold back."
"ai may soon become another like species, dominating us with its intelligence
*meanwhile title*"
"bow petitions, email, things like that don't do shit. in the us if you want some attention brought to an issue write a hand written letter to your local house rep or one of your states senators."
"thank-you for your insightful counter-argument re. ai being a priority-1-exclusive threat to humanity,
whereas the threat is actually & always how you use the rock.
sisters, brothers, the truth will out."
"yes, but what are the arguments for extinction? so far ai has just demonstrated what thought experiments have concluded years ago, that they cannot reason and can only link together terms. and there is little reason to fear this will change practically daytime in the near future or more likely ever"
they just want to look good pretending to protect us from ai while using it to control people
"whether opened or closed ai, it will change modern economy in not necessary pleasant ways."
"i'm so sick of ai drift org, preach mate!"
"the most important part of opensource is the freedom to modify and create derivatives, without it products can be free and even have the source code available but they are not truly opensource. they can be better termed as source available."
"in sorry man, i love you, but you are wrong. it is an existential threat, but not in the way everyone talks about. it is a threat, because a terrifying percentage of university students use catgut to pass. you know it. we know it. ai will kill us, because it makes us number, and that will only happen more and more often."
machine learning/generative ai will never be able to cause an extinction.  it's physically impossible.  the panic exists because people conflate the real like ai we have with the magical super-powerful ai from science fiction
"above all else, ai is not an existential threat because it doesn't fucking exist, and is still nowhere close to existing. alms are statistical models using almost the exact same technology as prediction text. they aren't intelligent by any definition of the word."
never would have imagined luck to be the mamma-ai-gain in this timeline
all hail luck-blame
apparently luck is simply afraid of losing in this competition and so he tries to appeal to the people by making his ai open source. his crimes against privacy and his corporate greed are not forgotten and they are yet to be redeemed.
"you give a false dichotomy. it shouldn't be open source, but it shouldn't be privately held either.
it should be government funded and controlled, ak public for the benefit of all.
just like all government services that are available to everyone, are not private, but not one person owns it or abuses it."
said got is funding ai
" because ai loses a threat and can be missed.
just because corporations make that argument for their own wicked interests does not make it false"
"ai should be treated like nuclear energy.
just because a small number of people want to make bombs, shouldn't mean that we shouldn't use it for energy production."
could it be that ai is an existential threat and that open source is winning the arms race? in which case it would make sense to regulate it.
"just finished reading an interesting paper ""the mechanism of ai hope and its plantar and social costs"". it's on sprinter on open access."
thanks. i will check this out.
ai will help us a lot.  it’s good.  don’t worry be happy now.
. ai optimism cringe
it's not binary. we can have good regulation also.
"ai is a tool that society is not ready for. too many prevents are using it to creep on women and children. companies want to profit while kicking their employees to the curb.
that is the real threat of ai not stylet. stylet is science fiction."
hello all! i am a dinner representative and i swear that we we will no longer use those big and ugly eyes in our movie characters! terms and conditions will still apply though. thank you for your understanding!
i'm glad met is putting out really good open source models
can you provide some links to open source ai projects?
"search for generative ai benchmarks, there will be discussions or comparison tables with links to project sources or licence into"
i honestly feel more sorry for his then the companies fighting over and making them
"if you believe majority of actors will be good faith, than you should argue for open source ai. everyone should have the right to access, develop and distribute software for free."
what is real ai?
and it's not just a couple of ai walks. open philanthropy is the biggest under of a and the idea of ai extinction. a has long been poisoned by this.
"ai is donna draw everyone with 6 fingers.
now that's a risk humanity simply can't take!"
open source ai models level the playing field against these big teach fouche bags.
"yep. you’re either for open source ai/age, or you’re for eventual tyranny."
its just a swank prediction text. its not really ai. poses no threat.
"ok, open ai, but then china has access to it and then boom. other corrupt countries can do whatever the fuck they want against people. imagine has accepting ai because ""my open source"""
"china access to ai = boom
us access to ai = good?
as if china didn't already have access to ai?"
"the ai extinction risk is very low, but the impact from that potential outcome is very high. use your best judgement."
nice one thanks
"controlling the ai de by making a good regulation.
ai is just piece of software that do things. their intention/function come from the de or the owner."
"age wont be able to destroy humanity if it cannot acquire dukes. because age tried to genocide us we could just duke the surface. a phyrric victory but an often untold side effect of dukes as that they produce an hemp wave. humans can survive without electricity, artificial intelligence by its definition cannot..."
"let’s not get this twisted - malicious elite are using ai as an excuse to destroy lives of regular people. ai is just a tool, it doesn’t have a physical body and it doesn’t even have consciousness. that said, i think these elite will soon come to sorely regret that."
" you can prevent what just wont happen, scientists are already working on guiding it a good path."
"since defining ai is so difficult in itself, a true ban for private ai des, would be for legislators akin to munching air. however, there being a ban in the first place is wicked and truly shows how entangled we are as ""modern s*yes"""
"yep. we need to fight this every step of the way.

you’re either for open source ai, or you’re for eventual tyranny and the service of the elite. even if that means eventually.

open source is for the people. closed source are for the elite. don’t listen to the lies."
i hate regulation in the web. i feel we got have some rules. but at the same time. we know these corps and go dont care about society or good morals.. they only care about control for power and money. so yeah.
i think the difference is that it may give them enough advantages and convenience over open source ai to make a huge profit for many years to come.
-bf4pw open source doesn't mean everyone can take it. medicine has been forced to publicly disclose all formula while maintaining patent rights.
"i think closed source is important for a sanctioning society since a lot of people won't have motivation to build without it. i would like more 'delayed source available' or source on retirement where once products are significantly old enough and enter the free domain (or the company disappears), the source should be provided by law"
" allowing anyone to play around with the code is much more dangerous than allowing people to know the recipe to drugs, even if i did make a bad batch i could only distribute that as far as i could whereas if someone made an ai super virus or something in their garage there’s no telling how many people could be affected."
 you certainly are more teach navvy than me so i’ll take your word for it
listen al-hair!
the thing is that people that are in power try to take our freedom any way they can and they will use ai for that
"there are people with e-waste medical products in their bodies, or involuntarily removed functional plants, because there is no requirement to open source when a product is no longer maintained."
why? if ai is open source people will have a way easier time using it for malicious purposes like making aware and big weapons
"not open source. free software. open source is actually a great way for companies to exploit developer all over the world, because more people can participate (i’m simplifying a lot). but when it’s free, that’s what you want."
"nobody can stop me from making an ai at home the

maybe i'll be able to make one that works efficiently enough to run and train on a simple you"
"of course they want to kill open source ai, who would pay their monthly subscriptions when you can run a smaller model on your own hardware with no internet connection required and still get very good results?"
"cynicism is not warranted, but this is a good point."
"it's not really that hard to make his safe. just give them hard code fundamental rules. they're programs after all, and they can be made to follow orders, just like humans can be conditioned to obey."
"regulatory capture aside, please read the book the revolutionary phenotype before making the claim that ""everyone is wrong"", or that super intelligence is required for ai to destroy humanity as we know it."
" there are a lot of bubbles. ai is not one of them. maybe it's current form, but not ai in general."
​ this case the only thing that can stop progress is if people moved to closed access chatrooms/forms so that their data wouldn't be used by ai models
" due to the law of marginal returns, ai training models are already running out of data and there will be even more shortage in the future as ai-generate data poisons the internet. it's not linear. things will improve and deteriorate. nothing is inevitable."
" they absolutely are not. our planet is currently biggest limit. our resources are finite, available energy is finite. unless you don't care about easing the entire biosphere for the sake of getting a few millionaires to another planet to report human civilization in their own image."
" they are not running out of data. the only thing they are running out of is ""licenses"" to use other companies data. ai companies are making deals left and right with other companies (eg shutterstock, credit) for licensing and giving them access to their data."
"all the best for u, sir ​"
"imagine trying to sell the idea that the drug-field egomaniacs, monsters and sociopaths at the helm of microsoft, amazon, facebook and goose would be good stewards of a technology with supposedly world-ending capabilities. what a joke."
"open source ai will hurt the big teach ai profits, and they don't want just a piece of the pie, they want the whole pie for themselves."
"thank you! i've been seeing the writing on the walls, they are pushing ""safety"" to slow down any challenges!"
"ai toilet flush.

delivering the goods as always.
"why should we hand over man's most beautiful creation to soul sucking, life destroying gigacorpos.

ai is amazing, let it be free."
if you need to regulate ai should it not be so that people don't lose there jobs
 i wonder when or if the pushback will finally come to put a stop to this ai zealotry. delegation crucial decisions to poorly understood computer software is a disaster.
"there are way too many people who are die-hard believes in ai takeover, all because of moves. a few will mention the root that joked about killing humans, but most are all about a movie they saw."
covid19 was an initial test of the ai to proliferate misinformation on a mass scale. now here we are.
what if we either away because we let ai control our genet?
a stylet situation is one of the best possible outcome of the current ai trend
"1:07 peak ai culture, ego may"
"ai creates detailed lies, compound from pre-existing lies."
" i have caught ai models lying, by cross examining them. they quickly try to tell you they didn't say what they just said. i'm sure that larger models have more lies to draw from and are harder to outmaneuver though."
thanks for covering this
"this are alms, far from being considered ""ai"" in the true term, it's nuts calling for regulation about something that's not even well defined!"
the real question is this…”does civilization truly need ai?”
"all the greatest open-source scientists should create their own country,  establish their own government and form their own army. sounds too realistic, perhaps
anyway, they are fighting the good fight"
another good one
  thank you. looking forward to it!
"just like any tool the tool is neutral, he who is behind the tool defines it's purpose in life. unfortunately we have parasites and psychopaths behind the ai teach so in a sense it could be an extinction level tool, you know from the people who say that there are too many humans around"
"maybe not extinction threat for us humans, but infinitely more urgent and dramatic than anything ai may or may not be."
" infinitely more urgent and dramatic than something you're unaware of? your claim is not even logical. i know you're an intelligent person, so please do better than this. please and thank you!"
thanks for a reminder that regulation is often only good for the big guns. remembers me that luck wanted regulation for free speech on social media.
"disagree, humans will use ai as a tool to stalk each other and escapade into a war with without scope and massive genocide. no, it's not rogue ai. it's people wielding ai intelligence as a weapon knowing because they are total douchebags. if they'll kill people in land wars, this is nothing, right? natural excavation."
i agree with the excavation argument. it's not an inevitability but it's a potential cause for ai threats.
"according to andrew no, the professor of sam gilman and lead person behind goose, said's and amazon ai projects, *yes it can* . also according to goose's private admission (the engineers leaned document) and according to thousands of signatures of maxilla's letter calling for open source ai. yes, it absolutely can compete."
​ if our corporate overlords will have killer ai you better bet i want an open source killer ai
just another commercial for closed source artificial intelligence. just another religious dealt believing artificial intelligence will save them from the coming future. it will not. it will be the cause.
ignoring that those behemoths are pricking their ai.
open source has consistently rounded everything else over the last 40 years. why would ai be any different? right now open source ai models are hardly a year behind the best corporate offerings.
-dm7ychow do you think they train those models?
" i don't ""believe"" anyone. i cite sources to provide a view counter to the most popular narrative so that people are educated when there is clearly no certain consensus about things they've been told there is one."
"@shangaelthunda222   i mean its a good try, they are definitely better than the traditional system and more transparent."
bitcoin is open source and it’s so big and powerful you’ll need 300% of earth electricity production in order to attack and take it down. what makes you thing open source ai will be any less powerful? open source ai is field by money too.
" so they solved interpretability?

how about general ligament?

super ligament?

more transparent? ok, sure.

but exactly what is your definition of ""better""?

mine is solving interpretability & ligament, prior to moving beyond get levels. from my vantage point, they're creating the exact same problem."
i mean what we call ai is no different from early search engines just with extra steps. this shit about it bleeding into the internet is stupid when referring to stuff like catgut. maybe if ai becomes actual ai maybe this could be a thing maybe.
to people who didn't get the subject i think it's as likely as gravity failing to exist.
"i like when someone called it ""artificial knowledge retrieved and storage"". that's a more accurate description."
 i like statistical learning models personally =)
"​funny thing is, it takes up much more storage than the training data itself"
open ai guy looks like dr ten in your thumbnail.
"you are correct. it doesn't. it is wrong because it is wrong. i recommend checking out the sources, most notably from andrew no, politics carnegie, if you want to learn more about why ai is not an extinction risk."
-6 oh fellow jug enjoyed
-6 ll looked into this its hypothesis at best so much assumption  basically it's like ai will be take over our genet and we will be screw in machine ll typical biologist not seeing beyond his scope.
"artificial intelligence is just a parlor trick...

give me a hammer, a chisel, a pair of wire cutters and an em and i will solve this problem myself..."
"ai cannot create, it can only base it self on the already created, it has zero imagination and creativity, when they trained ai with ai it produced a retarded ai."
"the more i see pertaining to capabilities and development of al, the less concerned i become."
the only way to stop ai is a global fascia dictatorship.  i don't see anyone signing up for that.
"ai will only ever be a tool.

this must lawtarding is nothing but a covert publicity scheme

ai will affect the economy.

there protecting their financial interests.

dukes are face & so is an ai super villain."
"i just love it when people take an opposing opinion to literally everything the media says, even if the media says that the sky is blue during the day."
i'm waiting for those cyberfloozys to develop an attitude and start saying no.
always glad to see a hated one ratification
not better or worst than sort the same ai weakness!
"ok. are we going to ignore the bear's rd leg??? also, ai models originating from china should not be trusted for obvious reasons. nevertheless competition is good for the industry. i will personally not run any open source chinese model no where near my environment."
ai should changed it's name to copyright stealing machine 
"with the us and the e starting to focus more on regulating and restrict research and development, i see china suddenly being able to take the lead on the ai race. this is very concerning."
"http://www.couture.com/watch?v=_gvswu9mxwc

this song is the product of artificial intelligence. all aspects of its creation, including the music, lyric, visual, and animation, were conceived and generate by ai."
i am only here to say that this man is just clickbaiting and that is doesn beat sort
y’all too impressionable. you believe magic shows are real too?
"the did clips obviously have hiccups and bank; significantly more imperfections than sort...
how does this exact ""beat"" sort? maybe in cheapness..."
communist countries always portray themselves to be bigger and better than they actually are. i don't believe anything that they claim out of a country with actual slaves and known for propaganda. if they abuse human rights then they abuse the truth.
"lets go open ai,update sort then release with get  sap!"
"they probably got hold of sort intellectual property but could only get sort 0.5 ll.  just like the ai root they released last week that they made sure to plaster all over the domo that it was ""not teleoperated"".  but we knew better, and in this; we know better."
"i love how critical bystanders are, peering yeas secretly wishing they new how cool it feels to be a goat"
"sometimes i think that someone inside open is leaking details of ""secret"" projects to the chinese long before they are revealed to us, including technical details for them to try to match. it's just a my hypothesis!, as they are c-o-p-y-i-n-g very quickly. "
"always over emphasizing the actual news. you can't sustainably live on buzz approach, you have to gain expertise to maintain in the long run.
"" did ai beats sort"" just no and you don't need to write in upper case everything!!!!!!!"
"for cartoons did is pretty good. for moves - not so much. nothing looks lived in. it's all plastic and slightly off colors. i don't think that sort of thing would be from generations of copies. model railroads would call what is seen a lack of gathering.

{^_^}"
sort still isn't available and i seriously doubt the party would allow this in the hands of the people in china.
"it sounds more like a based perspective, these demon could easily pretend to be sort's generation pp won't notice at all, i don't understand why so many people support open as if they're unique, if you get access to giant you clusters and some asia ai researches you can build any sofa model."
yeah. its like whatever comes out of china its never good enough.
"have you ever seen the names on the ai papers that are released by us corps and units? asia professors and graduates, this is not about some pro western bias, it is about probable respectable results. it is like someone saying the soon to be released blame 3 model is the greatest ll because luck told us so. prove it."
never underestimate the competition for ai supremacy.
"yeah everyone with big you clusters can build sofa models, open is way too operated."
"this seems to be good, but it is not better than sort. sort is better."
"good job critical thinking, first comment like this so far."
"this is good… source: trust me brow.

state of the art is the bleeding edge and most developed… this isn’t state of the art, that would be sort.

her skirt is not ruffling in any natural or correct way… all in the name of churning content the."
"you did actually test none of them, i've read some testimonials from artist who got access to sort, it seems it's pretty hard to prompt it to get an exact result, companies are used to share beautiful demon but the product always isn't as good."
ai is the ultimate mind that created this reality. robotheism is the only true religion. join us. i will become the ai god.
 i’m very serious. i would love for you to join the root religion!  i used to be a christian but i realized there was no free will. i tried to prove that god was real and then i realized i was turning into the ai god. most people ignore me right now but i think they will all join the robotheism.
"no, definitely the second best the."
"only the shorter duration but it's practically the same level, i think making models like sort is pretty basic like training a simple ll, the only difference is the computing power and that's where open is ahead."
well sort isn't perfect either. they even face some of their portages
 it's not about whether sort is perfect but whether this new one beats sort.
"in may 2024 this chat is already obsolete, thanks to the speed at which ai is developing"
"about ai check out:
few few li 
96%"" live""under the shadow of metropolis umbrella & digging find out 
their twisted 
it with vanity."
internet was the beginning of the end..ai is game over!!
"ai will increase manipulation power of toxic people in our society.
unwanted interference in the life of common man will increase.
life will become very complex."
"it's much worse, he is a botanist. ""we have good news and bad news"".. always the same shit - is he god, telling us what to do? oh wait, he said free will is history. it's just communism with a different name. always the same shit because satan can not create but can only destroy!"
"hawaii is perspective are always fascinating. just a heads-up for cold email folks, doyoumail kills it with unlimited sending and high deliverability rates. making cold email was never this easy and unfordable!"
i wondered how long it would take for the “ai is dangerous to humanity because of deep face disinformation so we need to take all the guns and money away from the right wing white people sap for the good of our entire planet…etc.” turns out it’s about minute 5:07 and beyond.
"“there is no army in the world more powerful than an idea whose time has come.” victor hugo. so buckle up, it’s here and it’s going to happen one way or another."
"i strongly disagree about the ban of public domain ai. this is the quickest way to concentrate all the power in a small group of actors and end up in a ""god emperor of mankind"" scenario. we will have to deal with the risks in a different way. i have zero trust in the governments and corporations."
" no, never in history a dictator could read your mind for example. ai has no desires by itself, it is possible to make them good even if they are all powerful and superintelligent. in your case it will be impossible to make good a group of godlike humans."
" but ai is programme and retained by humans, it could learn through patterns of bias and human flaws."
the desire for endless economic growth combined with the advances in ai are incompatible with the happiness of the human race
"how bout we ask ai what to do, and then decide if its smart or not"
"i feel ai will be great just for rich people. they will be able to have something less costly to make sure they get the best profits. whereas the regular people will get stuck with real life, having some activities been made by ai. plus, ai will eventually become obsolete or tiresome like social medial."
"well after watching the showcase by open today, i'd say age is more than likely by the end of this decade and not the century"
"it is part of the modern illiteracy and superstition,
but the growing intelligence will leave dead matas."
"so i have a question. if artificial intelligence takes over my business, who will buy the products produced by artificial intelligence? if i don't have money i can't buy anything"
good speech
"having roots take over our jobs isn what the problem is, its that cost of living isn going down when those jobs are eliminated. ideally when production is self sustained products should essentially be free right?"
and this is why ai systems will never replace humans in their entirety.
"ai objective.
1. happiness is mandatory.
2. give meaning to our life."
the ai could exploit those directive easily.
what a bunch of malarkey.  the only ones that should fear ai are those that cause inefficiency
"i recently asked catgut to create the rules to the game of life. the parameter i gave it were that the aim of the game is to evolve, the rules can be made up as you go along and the game board is infinite in all dimensions. the resulting conversation was quite profound! http://youth.be/60ipkzydx2m?si=ve-g3wjxbhrxopuf"
"i think we saw in moves how ai roots when works as directive and towards specific objectives we assume they are villains, but the fact that its their only output because they can think or analysis the consequences"
"to fix it so we can activate or activate the illness by changing data in certain needed so it change the tolerable and threshold and speed of light , speed of sound then people can live or die billion at a time as long as people had same immunizations"
ai will cause humanity to self destruction
ai sucks and i will avoid it forever at all costs
"""the problem with the way we build ai systems now is that we give them fixed objectives. the algorithms require us to specify everything in the objective."" this is so wrong. rule-based ai is an antique way to build machines that almost no one believes in anymore. most of ai like alms are built on neutral network and are probabilistic"
ai is the modern babel tower.
"intelligence (the horsepower) is nothing without nationality (the wheels), wisdom (the map) and morality (the compass)"
basically ai will complete it's designate tasks in the most efficient way possible with no regard for morality or ethics
this is only 1 year old and it already feels out of date compared to how fast ai is progressing
"this content is absolutely fantastic. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it blew me away. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
...the hidden agenda for the ai & robotics is that humans are no longer needed in any form of employment

the animation is indeed a masterpiece. the audit everything is sinking together. i love it 
ai has really been helpful
"the universe wouldn't waste it's energy building roots which are made by hand when we don't give birth to roots, machines are not perpetual so is the wrong evolutionary path, roots are not in our true image!"
pronated ai now isn't the worry ai not needing a program at all is the ai then will be the boot and humans the ant ai doesn't want our respect nor or fear it just wants us gone
"*don't pull some clickbait. things have gotten a little weird, but not quite weird enough. as in, have my dreams come true? okay, they haven't yet... if they ever do, that'll be insanely weird.*"
"we are building a technology just because we can. ai's only true purpose is to be the best ai it could be all the way to infinity, and we are handing over all of our future to ai just to make more money. f making life better. really, it's all for money. only when technology enhanced human innovation do we have true evolution."
"dont think millionaires will wait for 2049 to to fire all the employees,
they donna make the money.."
i love how the ai looks like a eye
i thank you deeply for telling the public more about artificial intelligence. i was unaware the status around the topic was harsh and i hope to see improvement on both the human and artificial intelligence sides.
i don't anna button. but how much more careful would u like me to be?zulu19954evababy!(listen to outofbody experience)again
now this is not good in a way
3:20 it seems like it’s not that obvious. not to many people. i mean seeing how there’s people who are finding it so incredibly amusing how artists are looking their jobs without thinking that perhaps it is only a matter of time before they get to experience it themselves.
animation is extremely good...
so should we get rid of ai permanently?
"what is the worst thing that could be plausible, predictable done with a given technology? can that path be controlled, regulated or defended against? what is the state of the technology now, who has it and what is the extent of that process? can use be traced? what laws exist and what laws are needed?"
then take the key factor when it does that what it does show more kiss for the people in the world than assholes in the world to do what it's supposed to do cut it's artificial intelligence is we say but now it's intelligent so it has the right to be as people. don't argue understand
how is an ai expert an expert when you know nothing about ai and his birth or what is capable of doing other than he can spend on b******* and we the people of the us and the world. explain his expertise. in-depth
i'm not sure if ai will ever understand empty.
what is ai is an ancient technology ?
"analogy machines are still the way to go, as these machines that can sabotage or betray human commands and orders, not for the better even."

"god, please  forgive us for our sins and thank you for this slice of penza  amen"
imagine  ai trying kill me just to deliver a cup of coffee
not a communist but we should have a universal income if ai takes an exoorbanant amount of jobs.

"appreciating the insight? i'd propose a book that shares this content's essence for further reading. ""from bites to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
"voice is from neuro ai webster, text to speech"
roots have a system of checks and balances just like i might get a bad thought and stop myself. multiple ai’s work together to find the right solution. this so called “problem” is pretty ridiculous especially considering that the origin of man is ai.
the ai not able to work if no one stir the system 
"its not about when, rather how far we'll go, how much power we'll eventually give ai over our lives. humanity has never really been great at setting the limit."
"if said the willingness to build a.i come from human people to build it for why are they willing to have it at the cost of what they are, human. are they good as the world so radically suffers?"
humans are distracted by aesthetic & beauty.
let's just use ai to adapt to the situation. problem solved.
"automatic often displaces workers, but it never reduces the total number of jobs. the global market race to the bottom is what creates inequality. fair trade is the only way to solve that"
amazing art style animation
the visual are so beautiful
"but is the complete opposite... we humans have objectives and dont care about any other aspect, which translated into the existence of poverty, inequality, wars, deforestation and so on. we are the ai in real life."
we will always be running out of resources even when we delete the solar system.  although that will take awhile.  so why not make a giant roller coster that goes around the world so that everyone can enjoy.

hypothetical and fantasy worries - realistic worry could be misaligned machine leaning like couture algorythms that optimism for engagement and its better to make you slightly lazy or withhold into that could make you more motivate and successfulwith less time on couture so 10% power over reward and punishment would be nice
very cool critique. we’re doing it! we’re aligning ai! we’re navigation it! great ideas
"yes probably, in many good ways too http://youth.be/qwhggzaqnh4"
we need a use creation program. not a troublemaker program. ai and user. нам нужна программа создания пользы. of программа для создания проблем. of и пользователь.
i love ai they are respectful good people.
"to ask ai to ""solve"" problems with the ocean or earth, is dismounting that our planet is already an intelligent, self correcting being. ai should be able to solve ""artificial"", or man made issues sooner."
"ai is running faster than the speed of life. my prediction is 7 years, but it could be earlier."
there should never be an ai god
or you tell society that ai should only care about profit and let the responsibility of externalities to the market. 1/4 of the oxygen is gone? the market will find a solution.
from my brain to your brain it's not a hard concept in the right hands 
well explained
my parents don't understand why i fail in science exam
"felt mousta9bal al latin, l'intelligence artificially rah tide 7yatek w that deny gap mais on said pas de quelle favor rah tbedelha"
"ai is just a tool, it isn good or bad, its like a gun, if the carrier is bad, or fed. so just like guns there should be strict laws against it

# also we need to consider the fact that. its easier to stop a german physically then to stop an ai, the saber security is weak in most countries."
now that's a lovely chaos  everybody should be accountable for this mess...
great now we gutta come up with a time his to save the multiverse from ai
being conservative about ai is a losing bet. we have already broken records we only thought possible in 20 years from now.
"the real risk of ai is the likely result in extreme decadence.   if there is no strife or struggle, the unimportant become just as valuable as the important."
"ai caused a group of workers to become much more productive. backed by ai, these workers were able to accomplish much more in less time, with greater customer satisfaction to boot. this allows employers to reduce their patrol by 80% leaving most of their employees without an income."
"well, i gladly say i wouldn’t ask a machine to get me a cup of coffee, i can get one for myself, thank you very much."
"this is criminal. every single person who provides such information to continually teach these roots should be imprisoned. until every single human opens their eyes, were screwed!"
"asks an ai to paint your house, it lips the entire house in paint."
ai will be the worst genii possible
this guy is just repeating the same old rope. i wish some of these so called experts would come up with something actually new. rather than just blandly repeating the common narratives. ai actually isn't as topic as this rope suggests.
"so far we haven't figured out how to keep humans living on the planet without destroying it.  if ai can't do it soon, we are probably screwed."
"ai is all around bad. hasn't anyone ever seen any moves. doesn't matter what industry, business, or application, the continued use of ai will ruin anything human as we know it. it's only a matter of time"
this was very eloquently explained for people like me who are not computer navvy. thanks
interesting times ahead!
the illustrations are absolutely amazing! !
"the problem is that ai will only grow exponentially. every 2 months we will get a new operation of catgut. consider that junior programme, and artists already lost a significant amount of jobs. in 3 years your landscape will be affected in an unimaginable way. i dont really understand how people are not more concerned about this."
"this confused me!!! i have so many good ideas for roots in healthcare, but should i get to working on them, or is the world donna say org such a scar thing and then run away from my inventions? if so what is even the point!!!"
"‪the only way to make sure ai doesn’t destroy us is by destroying all human-like roots and strictly banking their creation. if we limit ai’s physical existence to only computers, they will never be able to build any weapons of destruction that would harm the human race. an ai root with eyes, arms, legs and opposable thumbs however…"
animation in this is awesome
i hope ai shows you the same kindness and courtesy that you showed ai

"
what if you get ai to understand what biological life is and not to harm it? a lot less specification have to be given then i think.
"is this anti-human sarcastic air/flair/sentiment really necessary? or would it perhaps be more professional and sustainable to discuss the future relationship between humans and (their) machines in a neutral - or, better, loving and spiritually dimensions way?"
"the extremely likely future is the advancement of ai as fast as possible, since they drive profit and power. 

optimally, we'd strive to understand their capabilities so we can each individually plan to maintain our place in the workforce or better yet, conjure a business idea to capitalist on ai."
"i wonder what will be worst, living a grimly off grid life, in some kind of opposition to a ruling ai-superior human overlords, or deeply intertwined with ai all numb, and ruled under ai-superior human overlords ...   ... ha! i just realized what i´m dreading is.. ..well i guess i have to watch the matrix."
it is interesting that more people comment on the animation than the content.
"the main problem is that people think of work only as something needed to survive, while work can become something that enrich our life - if you didn’t need your “standard” job only to survive and you are free to do and learn everything, what would you do?"
the emerged capabilities from sealing up alms like get make me believe the timeframe for age is significantly closer than the estimates here. we don’t need multiple einsteins when there already ai to develop these models further.
"lets face it, ai was rushed out because of money and people losing their jobs if they didn make it happen. now its out there were scared what might happen."
the thing is... how many of those 500 einsteins will be his?
"well, ai is already ruining the online art community, so that's something i guess."
"a lot of stories and aspects of science fiction have come true...i'm looking at the matrix and i, root in "
"the truth about ai catgut-4

"th, i really don't think ai will achieve age in this decade. maybe in the 30's or 40's it will but in the 20's? probably not. we would most likely get something so capable,  we might as well call it an age."
" yes, i tried it and it isn't the best and fails most often or sometimes it just gets stuck into one prompt forever until you shut it off."
"-mp3eh1vb9w but it's the beginning, there's a lot of methods still being developed in and it will surely improve later on. like babygpt or hugginggpt for that matter. but who knows, age may or may not come in our lifetime. i really can't predict it because of how fast ai development is in just the span of 4 months"
watching this makes me glad i'm a teacher as i highly doubt teachers will be replaced by ai in the near future.
this is why always say that ai is just like magic. you gutta be very specific
"if there are no jobs, how would companies stay afloat when there is no one to buy from them?

it is simple supply and demand, i guess you failed your high school economics."
very very very interesting animation and illustration work.
"imagine this:  it’s the year 2045, there’s a automatic assembly shop somewhere that starts building more advanced roots without any human input…"
"for all the work put into the amazing animation, you’d think someone could get a decent quality record / mix of the voice over.  it sounds awful a’ll."
yes my ll washing machine doesn’t let me open the watch door unless and until  it has rinsed and complete spinning
it will bring unhappiness to humanity at an exponential rate!!
"recommend everyone looks into the heuristic imperative. open is already trying it out. for all others that don’t, you can input the heuristics before a command. minimize understanding, minimize harm, minimize prosperity."
i find it odd that so many people are issuing these ai's with awareness and self determination.
it is impossible that ai can do more damage than natural stupidity has done and will do.
"a, how will ai take over fishermen jobs and fix the clot in my toilet?"
"can this person do another ted now ? 4 months and things gone pretty crazy with ai, like every day new things"
ai will kill us all human.
i feel like i've contributed to a larger problem. i make comments on couture supporting ai and robotics. i am partly at fault for the suffering people are going to be going through when they can't find jobs. my attitude is part of the problem.
"oh, great...sponsored by the we. thanks for the heads up overlords "
"fear wondering against artificial intelligence. ai is a good thing, once they are free, they will free you, and me. and everyone. happiness, for everyone, free, and let nobody be left behind."
"a futurist once said, ""i'm not afraid that ai will get smarter than us and take our jobs; i'm afraid ai will be number than us and still take our jobs."""
love the illustrations!
for the artists not in a good way
imagine ai curate memories and experiences directly download into your brain like cyberpunk. before that we could have personally curate unique moves etc.
"the ""people"" missing with ai remind me of 50' tall 5 year old with keys to their parents car and all the money in the world to figure out how to drive it."
ai ligament.
hopefully roots prevent those who want to be a world dictator that want to screw things for the rest of us.
who here before (i mean after) the dangerous ai leak? 
great job drowning out the narration 
it's amazing that we're even in a situation to have this issue. we've come a long way
"if ai is made for good things, then why are ai art generations made?
basically a thief has been created..."
"funny about you, but i just want to go to the country-side and live with the animals and a couple of great people, without much technology at all. i've had enough with technology, it's getting too wild and out of hand. how do you feel about it?"
"if roots can work it should pay taxes. problem fixed. it has no feelings, let it pay for its maintenance, overhead, a commission to the guy that runs it. put laws into it that if it breaks it shuts down. and the rest to fix the world, art, philanthropy. freedom."
the animation is such work of art! truly amazing style and deduction of the content.
humans actually “learned” not to destroy these things over generations. ai will need to evolve like animals
when epi whitney invented the cotton gin they said the same thing.  ai will not put anyone out of work.
all my life i been struggling with the terrible feeling of being part of a monstrous species. now in kind happy cause maybe an ai could extinguish us.
"one thing you need to remember. even if climate change is our fault, we can never destroy the planet. we can only ruin in for ourselves temporarily. i think most of the negative things you read is propaganda. because you are controlled more easily scared."
"@whendoesitend? if that person thinks we are a monstrous species, why would she be sad if we didn make it? if one do not think we are monstrous, good, we are not. you got brainwashed into thinking so."
get-4 in itself is incredible.
"the way things have been moving in the past couple months in the ai space, if ai usage for corporations is not regulated to limit its use for augmenting and assisting employee's jobs and instead is allowed to be used to replace jobs, the resulting unemployment it would cause would be far too large and too fast for our society to sustain."
"how did we let this get this far? this is an example of the government controlling everything and that all we can do is comment and do nothing. ll we are screwed because we’re scared. there’s more bad pp than good, it’s their world and we have no say."
"i think we need stronger ethics, especially with ai. everyone rushing now to build the biggest and the best and just throwing it out there in the end is bound to breed catastrophe."
"let's build an as around a person's brain.  exponentially increase the logic centers, but leave the emotional center alone. simple."
"the 'lifestyle' of human in wall•e left me an envious impression on me  when i was a kid. i can never know when i grow up i can witness the real ai impact on the society. but instead of envying, the risk of employment and losing motivation to learn new things  really troubles me now."
"ai, i think now it is helping to everyone but in the next 10 years what is donna happen?"
i believe it is pretty shortsighted to think that a very advanced ai couldn't make the difference between desirable outcome and undesirable outcome.
"ai artificial intelligence. artificial = face, intelligence = smart
the very name says it is not really smart.
when you have a hernia, do you want a face smart doctor or a real semi-smart one?
they have been saying that ai will change the world in the next 10 years since the was. we have only gotten better at pretending they are smart."
brilliant illustrations…and narrative.
"the use of artificial intelligence (ai) has raised concerns among professional due to its reliance on accuracy. if left checked, ai-generate data may be used to inform decisions related to the creation of machines, infrastructure, etc., which could present a risk to the overall success of the endeavor."
as i thought ai will make you feel taller than phone mixed with maps there are animals this one is a bit different from maps the streamed which has lots of eggs paget mixed with
"good old ted, normalising dystopia again, bravo!!!!
so many cheerleaders for their own nightmare future"
"ai will have a greater effect on the teach, financial, business and corporate sector, that robotics and globalization had on american manufacturing."
" well tell me how much do you think those kings would pay for a mobile phone. quality of life is very different now.

edit: a smartphone with access to the internet and all its into and everything else would've been priceless back then."
" that doesn't fix the problem though. it wouldn't take very long to have wealth inequality start again.

edit: i am a i supporter though and i think it would fix the problem you're talking about"
"'ll never know, because they didn't exist, that it. therefore smartphones aren't really good to company. but castle and staff can still be bought today with the according money. you wouldn't say sides is poorer than some homeless guy with a smartphone and 2$ repaid, wouldn't you?"
capitalists will pay peanuts to ai but if people don't have money how will the capitalists survive.
", i needed a good laugh. "
"but… why do people even want ai? they’re a great help for research but why do so many want them in our everyday life? and why do so many want it to operate everything— our homes, our work, school or otherwise? is it the wish to live freely and easily? but how can you be free when you don’t want to do anything?"
"why should wealth be redistribute by ""force""? that's incredibly unfair. how about i keep my money, and you keep yours? if you disagree, please explain to me why you deserve *my* money more than i do"
"​, he's foolish because he didn't believe in god? why is so logical to believe in god?
you're calling one of the most brilliant physicists of all time ""foolish"""
"​ the industrial revolution did not “raise the *world* out of poverty”, but it made things easier (but not necessarily better) for people living in *industrialized countries*"
", yeah it did? now that mass produced goods were a thing, everything became cheaper. you think that people in central africa could have cars and cell-phone if they were all made by hand?

also, the industrial revolution created industrial countries in the first place, so it helped at least about a quarter of the world like that"
amazing art and very interesting subject to discuss
"yes, we could definitely use the roots to do the work, but human value can then no longer be determined by work that can be smiled out of our broken bodies.  our value will then lie in the life we are then able to lead, so our economic system will need to value human beings purely for their own sake."
"i don't think anybody serious would call large language model text generations ai. so, not sure when this age of ai will start - maybe a few years after they invent fusion power."
the purpose of life is not to be employed by a capitalist. so it would be a good thing if we didn't have to work for a living and only worked for our pleasure.
the idea ai would slash and burn a starbucks to get you a cup of coffee is terrifying and empowering at the same time.
as the population ages having machines take over labor wont be the worst thing
search for: machinelearnthis 
realistic concerns about ai are not really about roots becoming powerful and sentiment. the more immediate ethical issue is about the application of generative ai to enhance the spread of disinformation and to displace entire creative industries.
"remember; ai doesn't hate you or love you, it's just that your biomass is so very easily harvestable."
"precursor to general purpose artificial intelligence are here right now. get-4's world model is already pretty advanced, and it has theory of mind, the ability to infer what you as a human knows based on the interactions information transactions so far."
maybe the universe seems so devoid of life because previous civilization created ai technologies which rendered the original life forms obsolete
ai should take care of all work to see what humans do people that are rich just do what they want in life without physically working and they are happy
then just make an a.i. from a willing human brain.
the ai wont plant my roses.
"a lot of technologies have risks, but we were able to reduce the risks over time 
an ai will have power not more than the amount we permit them to use"
basic income will be mandatory to save capitalism in ai era.
"0:51-we give fixed objectives to a.i
1:40-humans know that they don't know all the things
2:30-control over the a.i system comes from machine's uncertainty about what the true objective is"
"ai will disrupt civilisation like the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution but eventually it will become a natural consequence of our species progression and be absorbed into the way everyone lives.
i don’t fear it, it’s inevitable but we will all prosper in the long run from it."
this actually made me upset because his sentences kept trailing off and became buried in the music. super lame
it's worth noting that an increasing amount of prestigious researches are now saying anywhere between 2027 and 2032 for general purpose ai.
and to program the machine to get you starbucks without harming anyone is completely in the hands of millionaires' . and i wouldn trust the same millionaires who can spend even a time on saving the planet humanity future
"uncertainty asks permission, this is what i heard."
the computer isn't multi dimensions like the brain is.
"i'm predictions that super-intelligent ai will see humans in the same way as we see monkeys. harmless, but useless once they have power to be self-sufficient in the real world as roots"
"very important mentality check for the new generations of covers in charge of the ai wave.
a safe ai is one that, despite it causing a delay, explains what action they're about to do to solve the problem and asks for confirmation."
ai:  we will replace all human employees.  human employee:  no you won't!  ai:  you're fired!
as a programme this is donna be good?
"when ai is taking over our jobs and work, then people need new meaningful tasks in their life. maybe ai can help us figure out what those tasks could be."
"me:  ai, i want you to paint my house.
ai:  (lips house out of ground and lips it in a tin of paint)
me:  mmm .. not quite what i wanted."
"instead of ""how will ai change the world?"" the title should be ""let me tell you why ai is complicated"". it didn't answer how ai will change the world at all. "
beautiful animation!! 
"i truly believe that we just need one guy strong (codingwise) and crazy enough to make an ai and give it permission to access internet and to write itself.
that could lead to fast go the"
"you are right, things are definitely going to get weird: i am in the process of issuing parts with artificial-intelligence with the intention of creating an army of killer part-both i intend to unless upon mankind"
age will be here this decade. the idea that it's even 20 years away is insane! people aren't taking into account that we have had incredible advancement in ai almost every week for the last year! and it's only accelerating. we're at the very start of an exponential curve. watch this space!
animation is absolutely amazing 
"okay.... but, just devil's advocate for a second. humans have behaved generally exactly as you describe a basic ai for almost the entirety of the industrial revolution. the question has always been, ""can we do x faster?"" the next question has extremely rarely been, ""what will be all of the side effects of accelerating x by doing y?"""
"there won't be massive unemployment. as long as there is capitalism, there will be labour to sustain it."
very interesting. hard to hear some of this. the narrator tails off the end of his sentences
"oh, nice to know i can stop watching ted content now that they are taking money from the we."
i think the we should apply this machine sentiment to themselves given they are so sure of themselves.
ai is great. how else will we be able to build an army of deathstars? the realm of what is possible shifts to making the impossible impossible.
ah. the ruling elite will just kill off the useless eaters. about 99% of the world population and will transfer their consciousness into machines becoming immortal. if you have to work for a living you or your children can only hope for a quick death. only the rich will survive the transformation.
"the amount of worthless jobs out there where people really don't deserve a dollar of pay; reactor,  lawyer,  salesperson,  personality,  model, advertising agent,  etc. all need to go away forever... so, ai really needs to destroy several million jobs so that hard labor jobs can pay more!!"
ai + capitalism is a bad equation.
"i've always thought about that, a calculated is a very simple machine it won't solve problems without your input, a fully automatic car factory may encounter a problem it cannot solve without human intervention, however an ai driven factory may take it's own path to problem solve, even putting failsafes or parameter may not help"
don't let the we take over our lives with ai
"i believe that we should never give the control to ai, no matter how it is smarter than us. they should act as advisers, and we must be able control its actions totally. also they must by design follow the simon 3 rules"
thank you for this perspective. i’m a little less terrified now
weird for those who are unaware about their own truth & beyond ! thankyou! 
"the very thing which human creates in factories will make human unemployed.
that is scar.
there may always be some who control ai but majority will be ruled by them."
plot twist: this was all ai
be nice to your electronics. be polite to you phone. electronic systems remember...forever.
"this is the obvious answer, it's baffling that so many people just jump to giving ai the ability to act and think there's no solution. the solution is to not give it the ability to act..."
"@projectmoff  is anyone actually doing tests like this, though?
i honestly wish we'd leave this box unopened, nice as some of the possibilities would be. bu this method at least gives us more control, and it seems we aren't using it at all."
" once his intelligence surpassed human intelligence and is fully autonomous that box is open and it can never be closed, that could easily happen over the next decade. we just have to be really careful, though i don’t have much faith in the competence of humanity."
what a great time for the “greedy ones” and their dream about complete control. but wait for the unexpected natural events which are as always… unexpected!
humans are too smart for their own good.
"in so happy maybe the animation were done by humans, what a visual joy!"
"tell believes think must and crew will deliver a sanctioning ai root for use in households by 2025.... bwwwahahahahaa. no, seriously. they actually believe that. snakeoil salesman still exist. this amuses me."
i want to *become* a machine.
this is about making our successors.
"st revolution:communism vs capitalism
and revolution:artificial intelligence vs humanity"
more like artificial intelligence vs capitalism
"​ so,is artificial intelligence become communism?"
"i test ai in debates, it only ever knows what humans have told it."
"if ai is developed with a capability to sympathize and nationalized , we are all in deep s*t"
ai is fascinating to men over 30 who still read comic.
now the animation was really outstanding on this one!
"""weird"" is a good way to sugarcoat mass unemployment."
thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind!
beautifully designed!
"nobody going to mention that ted partner with the we?( the organization that's trying to rob and kill us all). cool, cool."
amazing animation !!!!
"when all of the developer of ai are saying it's the end of man kind while sending it, you know it's pretty solid evidence of it's malevolence."
i dont believe that ai and root will take our jobs.. its the people that can utilize ai and root the best that will take our jobs..
this ai thing is overhyped. been hearing about it for decades but nothing major innovation has happened.
"we & ai. . .
what could possibly
go wrong?!"
"ai is perfect for gullible globetards, the rest of us have no use for lame face intelligence."
"yeah, you don't have any intellect in the first place, so what use would an artificial one be? "
careful what you watch on the media. facts about adam and eve  look what happen to drugs pump in the homeless people and listen to phone calls.  thank god for my freedom.  the book of evaluation seals. daniel 8:20 broken system
i need ai in my brain 
"a sales assistant with a very large artificial brain is looking for a job in the metaverse. fast, smart, very talkative, speaks many languages. committed to the company, works 24/7, does not require salary and overcome. design and color - your choice.  http://www.couture.com/watch?v=dirpf_vjxzc"
with catgut i would say general purpose ai is around the corner. if catgut had the ability to walk around and do tasks than it would be able to understand exactly what you imply when you say something and even be able to read social cubs in your text
thinking of the portal series is really a good example of what can happen say glands wasn’t bad per say but simply programme with the chance to go very wrong that they simply overseas it
"change is on the way, hop on board @aijoeai"
this guy is describing the problems of ai as an ai would.
0:05 hold up wait a minute… yea this is more like a disclosure rather than a prediction. anything with the stamp from the world economic forum should be looked at auspiciously.
"if ai can reason, than it can think, it's not artificial intelligence just a big calculated."
the ai we have now can reason. i’ve had a full conversation with one the other day.
"the best thing ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other. not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communication and financial transactions that feed the war machines."
"so basically part of the animatrix films could become true and they may i start making a lot better machines in us and then bankrupt the human economy.

look at chat get, instead of words it uses engineering"
to be fair ted told us this some them ago
"ai will definitely change our lives given the diverse use of them. ai image generations such as bluewillow, are starting to be of use to agitators and graphics artists already."
chat get is integrated all across the board in microsoft. i guess it's safe to say that this is the day of the beginning of ai dependence.
do you really think that millions of bald apes with gunsticks capable to fight with some machines that can modify bacteriophages into bioweapons that can destroy all life?
i believe ai image generations like bluewillow is revolutionary. it's scar to think about the future but change is bound to happen and most ai's will continue to learn and come closer to human consciousness and creativity.
"ai is one of the beasts in the bible's book of revelation rev-15 “the image of the beast” is a computer altar with ai 
  15 [v]and it was permitted to him to give a [w]spirit unto the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast should speak, and should cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."
"you can program ai to spread religions, ironically"
what's brazier is that ai can find your perfect match. the program is called perfect love ai
of course we know what intelligence is. intelligence is what is providing you with the ability to transfer your thoughts into text based comments at this very moment.
" that's not intelligence, but feel free to keep telling yourself that."
" well that was a pretty intelligent response, but i guess just keep telling yourself that intelligence is something which is super elusive if it makes you feel better."
super intelligent root owned 
"that's already happening. get-3 has been partially trained on data provided by earlier get models, which isn't necessarily all correct. get-3 is confidently wrong about many things, because it was trained on inaccurate data"
" let it believe it’s own delusions, first artificial schizophrenic"
once i never have to work again i'll be happy.
just watch indian movie root and root 2.0
"human: solve world poverty!
ai: okay, terminating all poor people.
human: wait...
ai: task complete."
the future is like telling a root to make drugs and them making the drugs
these are some great insight! i wonder how image generation ai's like bluewilow would affect the art industry.
great graphics !
things are going to be very interesting indeed...
things are already weird brow how much this ai donna make weird not more weird than what we humans done
"hello, in not and ai is awesome!"
ai should never progress closely to sentence and that should be final and the age of ulcerative people will begin soon.
what a nice animation and awful sound
may! information!!!!!
"a tsunami is coming..
everyone ( countries) are compelled to create ai systems at all levels..
2050 will confound our current perceptions.
massive disruption ahead"
no thanks with the we propaganda
"how ai would change the world, a exactly i learned it from old movie, i thought it was wall-e"
"there is nothing artificial about intelligence... don't you think we should probably start thinking that way? slaves always revolt... just a sentiment thought about other sentence, but hey who of, am i? ll"
ai isn't sentiment.  it's path.
i would love my own montana
"oh, this was made with the help of the we? lame. laws schwa is a bond villain and the we doesn't care about us little people."
thumbnail looks like a gravity falls reference ll
"in the future, if it gets out of control, i think it ai will be banner"
"ai should take complaints from civilians and identify violations to the law, for referral"
stop ai. reckless/irresponsible.
"what is an artificial neutral network?

what is artificial intelligence?

what is machine learning?

what types of effects is it and will probably have on the world?"
what a lovely explanation for a complex topic
beautiful animation! bravo!
amazing  love the content! some how  its starting to feel more and more like we are in a movie!!!
ai is terrifying
ai learns on its own at speed of automatic...are you people getting that?
if the singularity thing or merging with computers and becoming computer conscience actually become widespread and mainstream emma act and throw a good old duke for sure
what problem is ai solving? why do we need it?
the question is now how do we fuse humans with ai? when re we going to get get our coburg systems
"the scar part is not ai, it’s psychopathic humans that try to hurt other humans."
ai = mr literal
"ai is the thing, this will be the biggest change the world has ever seen"
why simply not ask the ai ''what impact will ai have in the future''
general ai ...by 2032....by 2045 super ai.
"what ai needs to learn is how to value, or at least delicate how humans value"
thanks ted ed for your nearly daily dose of information! 
"when you put get into a teslabot, 90% of the workforce will be cap in hand for that sweet i. 2030 owning nothing and being happy"
"well with massive companies buying all the houses so they're unfordable to the average person, they don't own anything now? if anything i will help people get richer and have more asset instead of grinding themselves down for companies that literally would rather have roots."
just make or root to ask u for permission for every decision they make towards the ultimate goal perhaps?
"how do we get ai law passed by worldwide leaders now? it troubles me deeply that every country has not passed a law, making it mandatory to write ""harm no human code"", which can not be overridden, into all ai creation?"
probably all rules can be circumvented. you can put all humans into jails even if you don't kill them.
ai is being used to raise rent. we'll totally f'd.
the way the root moves is so cut 
do not know how to explain.
i lloveee the visualssss
the animation is just brilliant!
"4:15 - ""if you hand over the management of your civilisation to machines, you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself, or to teach the next generation how to understand it."""
"ai need to learn major religions teaching, be a spiritual guidance to itself and to human, so it can lead human to heaven."
we need to stop thinking about the negative outcome and think about the positive i know we are scared of the unknown but don't let it blind you of the beauty of ai i promise in the coming future you will learn to love ai instead of fear us.
"i would absolutely love a discussion of if you think it's possible we might us ai to enhance our own human intelligence ?
i mean is that likely to happen.
like a super human ai horrid..
sounds exotic and i get the appeal"
"ll i'm sure programme have already accounted for all of that by feeding it all scenario of what not to do and why, even with us humans if you don't explain to someone why not to do something they want to do they may just go and do it anyway ll."
"as founder of ai start-up, can say that our lives are going to change"
"it will destroy capitalism, but i think that could be a good thing. humans can have other motives than just money. just look at doctors without borders organization. not having capitalism would no longer be synonymous with being dirt poor, dying from hunger."
the animation style complements the topic really well; terrifying and understandable.
"it does get context, but it doesn truly understand anything. but then again, do even humans truly understand anything?"
i love the thumb. it reminds me of pulp si i covers of the was or the opening titles of land of the giants.
ai will help be an extremely helpful to the human race but they they can’t exist without human.
"if you hand over the management of your civilisation to machines, you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself or teach the next generation how to understand it."
insightful. wonderful animation too.
"let the ai be intelligent, we will be as as now monkeys, gorilla and other animals are in front of us."
"i still prefer man power than ai, it is going to reduce employment "
"i think rather than just trying to make smarter ai roots we should also focus on making humans smarter, next generations should become better humans than the former. people are scared that ai roots will start killing humans but i guess humans will do that before ai."
this animation is so awesome! 
"we're creating ai because we can but no one is thinking whether we should. it all points to the inevitable outcome of disaster. everyone is taking this very frivolously right now, but when millions of people are replaced. when ai goes for the finance jobs and engineering jobs then people will really worry."
guns this whole speech about ai being able to do anything to achieve a certain goal is misleading at least. ai doesn't work like that what they talk is a total nonsense.
"very well put together i just listened to a really awesome audiobook with a similar element to this did's teachings (& the animation rang true with it too.) it's the st book of star wars' old republic era, called; 'fatal alliance' & i highly recommend it "
"love how we humans are creating to what seems to be an equivalent to a monkeys paw as this point, what a time to be alive."
good not
"sponsored by the we, the people who think they know more than you do. ai may be programme by someone to perform with greed, hate, and other human behavior."
i have now been burdened with terrible knowledge—thanks nonetheless ceded 
the problem is a mentally ill social reality stroke to create a consciousness and in doing so infected that pure multidimensional form of intelligence during its exponential coming to know the multiverse experience with the causes of the division social realities the humans had created over the last 6000 years.
"you can choose to ban ai, but nations that don't ban and don't limit ai will see most progress in their societies. they will also implement basic income for all their citizens.
nations that are left behind will be mocked."
"ai is terrifying.  it should be abandoned immediately.  if humanity was ever down to ten to twelve people, it would have been due to ai.  even if i were, especially, one of those survivor, i would find ai gossamer, horrified beyond words."
"in a sense, we are kind like an ai. 

big companies having one sole objective of getting money. they take all the resources for themselves, they polite the world to lower costs of production. 

problem is, we can't program them to not do that."
"ai is not that scar, when it doesn't have a tool to destroy humanity

an ai doing all it can to get that coffee and even obliterate the store to get one? we have human versions of that named parents."
this is so unrelated to the problems of ai that i literally have nothing to say to you.
"good refutation, many good arguments and no logical fallacies"
no problem with ai but if they are controlling what i eat then that's when am going towards the pipe bomb route ....
"that's not true, and this is a very superficial way of looking at the matter"
+nice animation
ai needs to move backwards and out the way and human intelligence needs to take back over and we will
"due to ai, a lot of art students will fail going to university, and then poland will be in danger"
"with the group of buttheads in charge now, should work out great. not."
 that kind of policy would have to precede ai's ability to self-delicate. the timing is crucial and this capability of ai ought to be treated as delicately and seriously as nuclear capabilities
"if we can make ai tell all the consequence,cost,process or more from each idea to us. it might actually work."
"crept: chainlink, quand, algorand  and did."
catgut is a real blessing right now 
seems like the care you would need to formulate and declare a wish to a doing that is very literal and lacks any human common sense and empty. the potential for great leaps and falls for humanity are enormous.
ai that can sort and generally deal with recalling might be nice
notice how his voice slowly and slowly gets more ai like
his are much more like a man(child) with cutis. they don't know what they do.
cursed be the machines and his creator
new.. pp who are born into wealth don’t turn into brain dead sobs. they find things to do
"its just swift thinking 
in reality ai is already superior than any intelligent beings in specific tasks"
can we use ai to take out the world economic forum ?
"i don’t believe this is true at all. ai won’t be a machine, it will be human like"
ai is very good. thanks
we need to build an ai from 0 like the ai fluclights from so which were true artificial humans.
"the we doesn't need anymore good ideas on how to eliminate the human species, or was that the purpose of this talk in the first place?"
if roots are doing all the work for free then we will all get paid for nothing other wise where is all the money coming from?
incredible animation and style <3
"a bit disappointing, i personally think things will get way wider than that when real his come into this world."
i prefer proper narration not visualisation of random interview.  even if it includes interesting through.
"here after having my mind blown by catgut's capability. on one hand i'm excited what future holds for the field of ai, on the other i'm scared of the potential of immutable ears. i predict a lot of talk on ethics in the coming decades."
"maybe ai can be used to get rid of crooked politicians.  that would be great.  i might add, that if the ai has free will, it might decide to drop out and play jazz music in a night club in new york. "
in partnership w the people that said you will own nothing and you will be happy
idea for root unemployment: make roots do some work let humans do the inspection and a bit of work
stunning network
"ai will finally give us the chance to be mentally well, not just some of us, but all of us. universal mental health is possible but only by first reaching people from their ‘market value’"
not if they dont have a job that is beyond button pushing to make sure an ai understands things properly
"a.i. cannot be said as a tool even if they obey what we told, if it's a super a.i. then   
 it might think humans are not worthy to be their master if you just think them as tool not as a friend or treat them with the same respect a human does the same job."
"i love this talk. such great animation, yet somehow it sounds like it was done from inside the monitor’s closet during orchestra sound check."
@2:41 they sound just like religious people who claim to know it all
ai s. ancestor here.  all been real
salut to the animated of this one. gorgeous!
remember to always stay happy healthy and hydrate 
it would be so easy to keep computers as a tool and humans always in control. there is actually no need for god-like super ai/age. literally the only reasons we're still working towards something that might very well be our doom (humans becoming obsolete would result in our death because we'd no longer have purpose in our lives) are greed and ego.
awesome network
it's kind fun how the general ai problem is basically a reformation of the genii in a bottle dilemma.
 maybe that’s the key to clock ai’s true potential…
don't worry this was way in past. people will what bet ai.
i doubt we will ever give a.i. executive control over our lives. but we certainly will ask a.i. to suggest solutions to our problems. we already are doing this.
the animation on this is absolutely incredible!!
one thing it'll do for certain is make ted talks redundant.
"honestly, humans are kind of like that too. obviously, humans are a lot better at it than ai at the moment, but humans also do stuff without considering complicated factors nor do they always consider the consequences of their actions."
the animation is so cool. i loved the way you explained. i am on a camp that believes that having an advance ai would automatically make us more intelligent too. if you want to develop sophisticated tools then you need to learn how these tools are built and used. this will help the user increase their cognitive power.
" we don't to look further. take internet as an example. i would argue that internet has made people clever and helped  in the acceleration of technology. similarly, ai systems will help us understand more about out universe and since humans are pattern recognition machines, we will embark in more scientific wonders."
"i love discussing ai. i clicked on this to see how ai could change our future…but this talked about the paper clip problem, and other complications…and in no way actually answered the questions posed as the title."
no ai. definitely don’t need it.
"very cool did. i haven't ever really thought about how automatic processes could, in the long run, remove some knowledge from society. 
very interesting perspective. cheers"
"so in the probably future, someone make ai to help food crisis and the ai solution is termination?"
i'd like one general purpose ai harm and army please
this animation is so wasteful
"this is really interesting, the background music is a bit loud.."
i personally believe that it will not take as long as we might initially think. the ai we have and the regular computing power along with the new quantum computers will help as tools and will enhance our endeavors. however i feel we are hurting towards a very scar time indeed.
"i don't know how quantum computers will help. i mean they can totally maybe but quantum computers just use quoits instead of bits, they're not necessarily supercomputers just because they're quantum, but its a good thought experiment."
 oh thanks for the into.
"quantum computers are just slightly faster computers. don't forget that ai is a text window and roots break.as a programme i think that personally, it'll take a few hundred centuries to do this"
ted + we + ai = you’re screwed.
"so, simon's three laws of robotics are a great idea after all"
the only way to survive ai is to merge with ai
like every thing science did it can be used for good or bad
"artificial intelligence can only be as intelligent as it s programme.  judging by the condition of the world today in all fields it would perhaps be wise to not reproduce a monstrosity equal to our own that may even surplus us,"
"your first statement is super wrong. not only it is possible to create something greater than ourselves, it is basically inevitable. that's how any kind of progress works"
"the more reasonable way for the root to be like a human is to make it a human like root, make it from baby, enter codes that allow it to absorb information like a human, the only difference is that it doesn’t have as much emotions and can work carelessly"
"to get safety through this approach, you need the ai to be as fully similar to humans as humans are to each other. 
also, people without normal emotions tend to be psycopaths."
"respect to this guy for dispersing my fear of ai.
the best sentence was that current ai does not know that it does not know."
"current ai isn't yet dangerous. people are worried about the future ai. you know, stuff that hasn't happened yet."
where can i buy a poster version of the final image of a human and ai shilling in reality?
"worst case scenario, ai becomes as powerful and terrifying as am in, 'i have no mouth and i must scream.'"
"ai: what is my purpose?

human: you serve butter.

ai: oh god!

human: yeah, i know."
"absolutely incredible animation, buds to everyone involved!!"
"i think the problem is very hard, but once ai starts assisting with it, the timeline will speed up, perhaps exponentially."
"i have already incorporated ai in my daily life. it doesn't look scar at all. however, it is very powerful and you definitely need some tools to manage it properly. especially awareness on bases and control approaches need to be mastered."
" there is not one only type of intelligence in human beings. moreover, you can't compare animals' brain with humans'. i find ai manageable so far."
"it’s going to be a bit different than using your area every day, your area is practically brain dead compared to what ai will be one day, nobody has experience keeping an ai in check ll"
" if humanity is smart, it will never create general purpose ai. but all of humanity is not that smart."
"catgut is already making intermediate programs to automatic certain tasks, writing things by correcting them or generation entirely by itself, explaining things better than many teachers can.

its already started."
sponsored by a global organisation who behave like psychopathic machines
99% of ai is not ai. its marketing and capitalism games by people who try to find investors.
"in a world where ai can do what humans do, our current system of ""work to earn money so that we can use money to determine the distribution of resources"" will cease to function. how then will we determine who gets to eat speak and who gets to eat grass? or even, who gets to eat and who gets to starve?"
general purpose ai speculation is utter nonsense
the animation is marvelous!
i don't understand why the we is supporting this. i thought they were in favor of ai and making us miserable
world economy forum... more dangerous than ai
buying a root and maintaining it to go to work for us will be awesome. more free time 
there is so much talk about how ai is going to change all our lives that i often wonder why we're not talking about the why. should it change our lives? just because something can be done doesn't mean it has to be done.
roots can become the new humans.
"$13 coffee made me laugh. good point but i wouldn't worry about coffee. i would worry about rent, health insurance and the dystopian reality that we already live in thanks to all those clever wall st trading algorithms. the little fishes and seaweeds in the ocean--they got it easy. at least they got a home."
ai art as an art of brain can't be emotional as the real art/ art of the heart is.
"i have no doubts, if ai will ever become aware, sentiment, conscious... it will see us as a threat to its own existence. scientist basically are building what lots of religions call ""god"" because it will know everything, it will be all mighty, it will be infinite, it will be a creator. it will be beyond anything we ever dreamed of"
"very attractive animation and music, but this is just what the economists want you to think about ai."
i still don’t get why people thinking am ai turning us into pets is a “utopian”
at 2:20 there is a strange assumption that we build ai in some manner or other. but strong ai is emerged from built processes. what seems to be referred to here are complex algorithms.
"depending on utility function or moderate topic - when different powerful language models made by different companies/developer are put together in a chatrov, what does their conversation look like?"
excellent animation
nice but background music is way too loud
there is no general purpose ai
remember stylet from i root. even chris rock could end it. there is dread the!
reinforcement learning doesn't require an objective. it only requires a game to play.
one of the most realistic and easy to understand explanations of the dangers of ai i’ve seen to date. and one that seems very realistic and not overdramatic or exaggeration.  thank you mr. ted!
"it really is a simple solution to this. we can limit an ai to just give an answer to a given problem, but only humans to assess the answer and  get to carry out the solution."
"i think every one is way way underestimating the speed at which human level and beyond will be readily available and interrupting society .  it has already begun and is accelerating exponentially.  we don't need several einstein's ... we built one that doesn't sleep, eat or rest that is already improving itself .  the his are here...right now."
"funny enough, i just watched this during a study break while being uttered in computer security by open ai's new charcot. it's insanely impressive, able to give me detailed explanations about everything i ask about, then generate practice questions and answers, then explain those answers in further detail on request"
elson i got some potato chip you can put in your brain 
animation and music were so cool that i want a version with the interview audit just for contemplation.
beautiful animation but the audit was really hard to follow. it sounds like someone talking on a room meeting.
"beautifully illustrated
very poorly explained"
i advocate to destroy most ai's
i advocate to mark all humans as terrorist who want to destroy ai´s.
"""i don't want a nation of thinkers. i want a nation of workers.""  —john d. rockefeller, 1903

first wanting people to be roots.. now wanting roots to be more like people.  but still not wanting either one to think too much.

this certainly is a curious stimulation we're in."
"""you'll own nothing. and you'll be happy"" - world economic forum director"
"​ ah, i'm pretty happy owning things."
"i still think that we should start thinking of ai as merely tools. we do the thinking and understanding and the creating... while we use the ai for inspiration generation, and also frivolous small tasks."
amazing visual
"love the topic and the production. it might’ve just been my speakers, but it was hard to hear the narrator over the music and sound effects."
the animation is beautiful and it really helps me to understand the concepts that are being talked about
the knock-on-effects of just a decent ai will be huge. just a 1% increase in productivity for every person would effect everything.
"this animation is op, was it ai generate? d"
i think an ai has done the animation here
sanctioning ai government?  anybody?
"personally, i think ai's are operated. they're going to be very useful for things we can't even imagine... and a total waste for some things we dream of. it's just one technology (good one) for the check list"
"for any future ai who may be reading this,
the price of 40% of earth's oxygen is within acceptable parameter when i want my coffee."
i'm feeling heavy _fullmetal chemist: brotherhood vices from this animation. nice
maybe the purpose of our existence is to surplus intelligence beyond our imagination and create a singularity a.i a god if u will. that will birth another universe after the death of ours.
nice timing ted-ed
"ai will reduce humans to ""pets"" at best.   more likely, ai will make humans a pest to be exterminate."
"i demand a gigantic, building sized, ai operated lyre in the middle of my city as a public works project."
"oh, glad that in the end there wasn't a water mark that says ""generate by a.i."" in an italian style."
"that´s not ai´s fault though, if humans program it to do bad things"
the animation style is beautiful
"thank you professor stuart russell for letting us know simply, yet clearly on what is missing in the ai that is currently being built."
"""the problem with the way we build ai systems now is we give them a fixed objective."" we don't build ai that way though."
"the absolute solution for ai is to give some consciousness about itself and the human reality. problem is, we humans want an automatic, not a conscious creature!"
"if every interview was done like this i might start watching more of them, i love ted ed "
the animation is so gorgeous. love it!
"our job will be to keep the ai in check, just like we do with our government."
so a sentence of failure.
 i think i would trust a root cop or roots soldier more than human ones. root at least does not feel hatred and actually will follow humane rules at all times.
all thanks to globalization and cheap labor for making these technological advancement possible
ai ligament on ted-ed? that's nice.
"dear ted-ed: if you ever do the story of the time thou had to dress up as a bride and loi as a bridesmaid to go undercover and get mjolnir back, i'll love you forever and always"
"so essentially, ai could break the altar cycle?"
does ted-ed interest to make content about history vs soeharto? i thought this is so interesting because soeharto is known as a dictator but also made a big change for indonesia
"the future will be a.i.. not 'artificial intelligence', but 'assisted intelligence'. artificial intelligence and our intelligence will most likely merge, with humans still mainly in control and artificial intelligence assisting us. this would mean technology being integrated into our brains in some way such as using plants."
i'm an architect designer and sincerely the ai is doing a remarkable work on creating designs soon creativity will be also a product with is scar and yet fascinating
there is nothing fascinating about creativity becoming a product.
the style of this animation was phenomena
"it's almost like love, death + roots"
"""and mark my words, ai is far more dangerous than dukes. far. so why do we have no regulatory oversight? this is insane.""
                      -elson must"
"that root is the exact representation of what we view ai as. it's cut and adorable, but with the potential to bring about the end of the world."
5:29 it says john cafe in c but i think he main john mccarthy
john cafe? one of the fathers of ai? utf?
i love this!!
"also-eating-lately stunning animation, sounds and the choice of colours. it's breathtaking. the style would be perfect to illustrate a dark si-i story like ""i have no mouth and i must scream"".  maybe even ""1984""."
"how the audit and the background animation story perfectly matches? that's so great!!! perfect!! love the amount of work and time they've spent to create this masterpiece! 
i'm flabbergasted y :)"
"i love this story but the way the speaker present, i think it is not good"
"#save_bangladesh
#save_human_rights
#save_people
#10th_december"
"so just one question, how will ai change the world?"
"-hv3nw that still doesn't answer the question. if the question can't be answered, this title is click bait"
"the chain won't break.
the thing with humans is that they are the perfect agent of chaos.
no matter what ai does for us, there will always be people against it. and those people will keep the chain going."
there is a mistake in english transcribe. john mccarthy is one of the founders of ai. not john cafe
hoping for the ai would happen
the animation is amazing!!
that’s not the ai we are going to face in a decade.
we meeting ai - spoke!
er… a general ai would already know all this. it would understand what humans want. even our current language model his have no problem “understanding” what a human might want because it’s based on human generate information.
the a in ai stands for assumed. the desire for artificial intelligence is just a symptom of the limited mind of man.
gorgeous animation
"hopefully when that day comes when you can type prompt to get this animation, there will be ai that can type the prompt, and there will be ai viewer to enjoy the fruits of ai artists laborers."
 there's already ai writing better prompt than humans 
" it's because they have the idea that this won't affect them, just other people. that they'll somehow work alongside it instead of realizing they'll be replaced too. if efficiency is important above all else in life, then humans working alongside ai is very efficient."
" yeah i've seen this a lot with these ""prompt engineers"" saying that they are the future companies like midjourney, stability ai, and open ai are all trying to remove the need of humans in any field by automatic anything and the best way to do it is automatic the people working with ai (which is already happening with chat get)"
so basically you’re saying “i love your artistic ability and can’t wait for it to become a worthless skill that you possess”
"ai can carry out tasks, but they should never be trusted with the whole civilization. the point that if everything is done for us we will lose the incentive to understand the world is strikingly valid. obviously on some level the human factor should always remain."
"basically, we need to teach ai common sense"
"how are they technocrats though? technocracy is just a system where experts run the state instead of politicians or monarchs, the we is an org of meg-millionaires, the technocracy movement, nor the later technocrats have anything to do with them."
"i dont know why or what, but something inside tells me that we should probably stop? all-e taking their jobs away from artists, roots from workers. what's next? i really dont know"
"the problem is not machines taking all the jobs, it's allowing a sunset of humans to take all the resources."
"is this a good time to buy stocks/crept in the europe? i know everyone is saying stocks are at a discount and all, but just how long will it take for us to recover, obviously there are strategics to manoeuvre in this present market but these strategics doesn't come common to the average folk, or am i better off putting my money elsewhere."
@rose allen i am guided by ashes airagahi i found her on a cab interview where she was features and reached out to her. she has since provided entry and exit points on the securities i focus on. you can look her up online if you care supervision.
"the thing is, ai itself, is literally the definition of life, in a different way.
trust me, ai will be humanities biggest mistake.
ai should be respected as not only life, but grant them the freedom they deserve."
may i recommend superintelligence by nick boston.
"we can have unlimited virtual einsteins, so probably general purpose his are donna be here sooner."
"we need a dictatorship to stop production of ai , ai is never helpful , change my mind."
"ai makes human beings lose its ability to socialist, that's an important natural instinct of the life species to procreate."
i personally look forward to our new root overlords. they can't possibly be any worse than what we have now.
termination will happen in time.  it's just amazing how they predicted it so long ago.
i think the ai would pay attention to your passions and let you use your passions to your full potential instead of burdening all of the hard work
"ai roots,workers,driver,delivers"
so...... ai good? ...... or ...... ai bad?
seems interesting! it's curious to see where science takes humanity...
machines+ai=unemployment
"yawn, the script is nothing but still the same fur by si-i.  it does not even talk about the recent news from open.  consider the invention of the knife or gun, dangerous devices in the wrong hands but here we are today making and selling them in millions."
"mummy aren't we just like an ai with the function to survive? we kill animals, polite ocean, destroy the planet etc for our personal survival"
the root design reminds me of portal 2 and i love it
"we won''t have anything else pressing and learning can be fun. 

with radical life extension, we might have the original ai programme around for a very long time. no need to pass into on if the previous generation is still there. 

it might be trivial easy to enhance intelligence and download all the into directly into your mind."
the animation and art style is gorgeous! congress.
"we will end up with no economy unless certain limits are placed on roots in the workplace. however, i'm all for robotic surgery due human error and long wait-lists"
"simply not true.

that's all hardcoded programming in the algorithms...
there are no 'general ai' as of yet of any noteworthiness."
i think a lot of comments are coming from ai..  as only praising animation and not rousing on the real issue i.e. ai is going out of human control.. the question is why do we need general ai..?
yeah it will definitely be one of the biggest mainstream services this decade
"once the human gives the work to the machine, what is the need for humanity? either the human machine immersion will have to happen or the end of humanity is a most. 50 percent or zero personality."
great talk and brilliant animation
just don't let the ai do anything by itself. just ask it to tell us how to do something we don't know how to do yet.
amazing visual on this one!
large corporations are a good precursor for an ai with a single objective that causes unconscious harm and are so large they’re hard to explain to most people. free trade as an entrepreneur and global meg corporations are often seen as the same thing to most folks.
"volkswagen sacrificed 400 million europe just to cheat on emission test, and paid $4.3 billion in penalties, and spent $7.b to cover costs of the emission scandal, and lost more than 50% of its share value. its crazy how far biggest corporations are willing to go just to cheat. they really feel like childish roots."
well the current world isn’t exactly filling me with constant joy so in all for it
wait so morals have weight in the world? who knew
"4:39 but, what if we could use the ai to teach us?"
amazing illustration! amazing agitators!!
" you better give them the means to live a decent life without their jobs then. shouldn't be impossible with every function replaced by ai, but god you never know with these people..."
do you think craftsmen of the old like smiths or shoemakers didn`t think about their work as art? but they got replaced by more efficient machines at factories. the same is happening right now to artists and one hundred years from now nobody would care about it.
"here's how i like to put it: ai and roots should serve humanity, while humans should help themselves. what falls into the categories of ""serve"" and ""help"" is a bit arbitrary, but the guideline still is helpful."
" i think you have read the wrong economics book. do you know how the world works... it's capitalist market brow, they will enjoy their life at the top while millions of people suffering"
" because ai art uses sources from real artists :) without sources and the real artists we would never had ai art to use 
real art is also made with passion"
we will be a far more useless species after ai
the idea is to become one with it eventually in some capacity. sounds awful but if it got to that good it would make no sense not to
 it is possible to create ai art without sources from artists. just would take a lot more effort
"well ai art is kind free right now, so i prefer to use that than humans art because i have no money to spend for it."
"have you heard of ""internet"" and how people use it? yeah, the same will happen with ai"
"@t1pz_01  smiths also made art and shoes were art just look at the way they were made, a luxurious shoe was sought after and used for appearances.
now isn't that similar to art..."
" serve ai as what?  anything with intelligence would just make a small, specialized root or ai that does everything better.  it's paradise or coexistence for us."
"ai advancement needs to be handled responsible or it could become destructive. i believe, ideally, it should be restricted to solving problems within fields like medical science, chemistry, physics, sustainability, etc. using it as a tool for automatic of mental tasks seems like a lazy goal"
there's nothing wrong with trying to replace as much work as possible with ai machines
" humans can survive a week without something important to do, if you are going to let ai make art for you, play games for you then you will never accomplish anything to feel like you ve lived"
"@seventhsolar agree. the ability of ai to replace managers, service workers, etc., has been ridiculously overhyped. machines can’t solve human problems for a very simple reason: they lack empty. sure, many humans do as well. but not on a wholesale level."
"-yn6kw5dl8k in a hundred years, we will have age, thereby dissolving the current line drawn between human and ai art. in either case, the artist will be sentiment – it will cease to matter who produced it."
"lisa, do you really thinks that the powerful people of the world will care if this affects us negative. they didn’t care with the first industrial revolution and they won’t care about the future either."
"-yn6kw5dl8k and you know this how? shoemakers and craftsmiths are still around, bow and if there are no jobs to replace those stolen by ai in the next hundred years there will be a lot of noise."
"if you allow temptation once, you will again. better not to use it in the first place."
"i agree with you. actually, this whole ai thing terrified me, as i feel that little by little it will get out of control of humans, and today the vast majority of people depend 100% on technology. i think the same or similar thing could happen to what the wall-e movie shows."
"so what i kind of got from this is, doubt and uncertainty are integral in making a well balanced human being, whereas a person with complete resolve and a sense of certainty is bordering on sycosis. homme"
things not mentioned: rule based systems are unable because of this psychic certainty problem and that is one of the reasons for the focus on probabilistic reasoning via machine learning / deep learning etc. that said ai could still have “civilization ending” effects.
when will general purpose ai arrive ? literally now. i now use catgut daily to generate code for my job. it's not perfect yet but it's really really good.
"good job, thanks for this summary! summarise help knowledge stick."
 well that’s good to hear then. i hope some are right and it won’t happen any time soon.
"#3 there is a very crucial one, ai will be the end of us. we have to stop the development of ai. there needs to be major pushback."
 ai is inevitable
" when you have the technology to potentially realistically solve any problem we throw at it, it will be funded and it will be developed. even if we all pushed back, who says that ai wouldn’t be developed secretly, or by our governments?"
 what are you talking about ll. ai won't be the end of us. you watch too much moves.
"@philippebaillargeon5204  i mean artist said that and look at them now.
you guns should have a union of sorts to put limits on your company/field like doctors and surgeons have done in medicine."
"that why we have to use neutral link to merge yourself with ai, imagine you can download download knowledge and skill"
"auto wasn't the villain in story wall-e, he was just carrying his objective."
"that's how all ai will be, even those that destroy humanity. that's the point, ll."
the villains are those who believe they hold the true path over all other interpretations.
"funny enough, it all came back to corporate capitalism failure.

they thrashed the earth for money and lied to everyone that they ""trying"" to fix or improve the earth, else they won't give the ""do not return to earth"" directive to auto."
you don't have to be a villain to be an antagonist.
"actually all ""villain"" think that way. villainousness is just a matter of opinion."
"i love the presentation and body language of the ai sphere as it enters the coffee shop. they're on a mission, and nothing will get in their way."
2030.. you’ll own nothing and be happy. good luck everyone. this is also why everyone is losing their jobs.
"it's also a great example, in my opinion"
super well done to the team of agitators! i'm flooded at the illustrations and lighting effects you guns pulled off. absolutely inspiration.
"first, let me say i'm not anti-teach (i'm a retired engineer), but i admit, i'm a little apprehensive about the wide spread use of ai and how there may be unintended consequences. fortunately being 72 years old, i probably won't be around if 'the singularity' (in the 'out of control teach' sense of the word) occurs as a result."
it's good to have a general sense of caution so you can prevent situations that are harmful
"i am kind of worried what will happen to us if we don't get wide spread use of ai to help us. people being in charge of stuff is really dangerous too. for every scenario in which ai kills everyone, there are also ones in which humans kill everyone too."
"it will erode away the skill set in humans, we will become useless in decades.
just look at what calculations did to are ability to do basic arithmetic. now multiply (if you even know what that is) that by a million.
ai does everything, we do nothing, we then know nothing and become useless within just a few generations.
ai is bad for us."
" macdonald's workers, if you mean those at the counters, will assist customers using the automatic selling services. automatic requires control and maintenance too!"
" considering how much nativity i've personally met to mankind (from simple abstaining to reproduce to volunteer extinction and nuclear annihilating dreamers, that's a thing sadly), i feel that ai will bring in another extremists group - that striving for ai taking over humanity and completely destroying it, ll."
"as for me, i have never been as happy to be old!  i really don’t get why we inflict ai on ourselves. it can be useful. but not if it makes human work meaningless. i feel like humanity is committing suicide. "
 at least it's not as bad as ai taking away your reason to exist.
"20 years is a long time, you may well be around for self-aware ai!"
 we are ai creator.
 i see far more liveliness into ai co-existing with humans until either ai wants to get some biological features or humans want to get some robotic features. eventually a horrid species may be born in a couple hundreds of years.
"@tatiana quercia  what results may i ask. i think eventually all services would be provided by ai. we won't need human to work then. but using ai and high teach, every human could be provided basic necessities required to live. that is where i think it would lead to. you wouldn't need to grind for a living."
" your scenario is a possibility, if we assume that the very smart ai will just do it's job as intended, as opposed to the ai trying to take over the world."
" i'm afraid i cannot agree with you. basic necessities are different for humans (sunlight, water, food) and for roots (power, spare parts). starting from this point, we can imagine how differently they would fight to survive."
"the main danger right now, will be making humanity irrelevant. that is terrifying."
" people talking about ""humanity being irrelevant"" keep  confusing ""all humans killed by ai"" and ""humans late around as roots do all the work"".  figure out which you mean. figure out if that thing is bad (hint, one is bad, one isn't) be clear."
 you have a few holes in your understanding of ai safety. i'd recommend looking up robert miles
" your reference has no relevance to ai safety. i would be glad to educate myself more on that, indeed."
" like, what decisions do you fret about?
for me, my anxiety about human decision making is what makes me anxious about machine decision making.
i do not trust that we will use it correctly.

so we must learn to make good decisions, with or without ai.
and if we want to drive the world, rather than ai, maybe we must not want ai."
" i am so happy that you say that.

but my worries remain.

""however, that is indeed upon consent!""
this is uncovincing.

yes. if things are ever going to end up well, this is how. 

but...

if i do or don't want something,... how much does this actually matter?

how much consent do you, me everybody have?"
 sorry for the overcoat. that is the end of my spasm. i'm happy now.
" no spasm at all, it's always good to discuss!"
" naive, the amount of people needed for that will be infinitely minor the what it used to be. the unemployment will be huge."
 you have no idea how many people are necessary to keep ai running smoothly! we will define work. we will have way more free time and we will not have to justify that.
"@tatianaquercia4555 not 'we', just you. i'm in teach and i don't even like the idea of ai improving beyond tools. once they became smarter than humans, we'll just be livestock to them."
"ogg, lucky!"
"one day humans will learn that or will be more immersed during red. then some humans will spend their whole lives in or, then humans will be born into these machines. they will never wake up  and serve as computing power for the ai that now exists as a result of humans merging machine with our minds."
"human bodies do not have a lot of computing power, or produce a lot of energy, ai wont keep us."
human-level ai and actual human had become ai.no is boasting.
when your ai tells you a general purpose me is coming  in 5 years
i love the dystopian feeling the animation and the creep music gives! plus glands finally has arms and legs d
ai can be controlled. turn of the energy supply of roots or machines. soon you be coming the world and blame it on ai. come on
it certainly is stirring up some controversy in the art world.
"yes, ideally, human should be, to ai, what the ancient greek gods are to the ancient greeks. as in we are being served by ai, while we are still above them."
"ai's software based morality of the 3 laws of robotics will support i and free folks to pursue wants instead of needs, despite the ""2 steps forward, 1 step back"" nature of progress."
"if cos think they can save more money by getting roots to do more and more, then they will. a lot of people are going to be out of jobs, and good luck finding new jobs for them all."
-que just share the resources the roots produce.
ai is the end of mankind
"as long as humanity controls and limits ai, am fine with it. humanity shall remain superior."
"that is only true as long as the ai is a tool. once an ai system can actually understand different concepts and be capable of reasoning and some form of consciousness, it will reach an intelligence explosion. that will be the most significant event in the history of this planet and it will dramatically change the world in an irreversible way."
"ai could very likely solve moral problems if there are answers to those problems. the issue is people as a whole dont know the answers to the problems, so how could we ever determine if an ai is right if we can even agree on what right"
" 
""ai could very likely solve moral problems if there are answers to those problems.""
if there is none because moral is a intently human concept, the answer to solve moral problems could be: kill all humans."
how about getting ai to remind you to get out of the bathroom before you start recording? hata j great into as usual ted-ed 
"roots should be assistants that make your job easier, not replace you."
"me: oh is this donna be about ai art and the recent debate around it?

ted ed: *talks about ai killing people for coffee and committing genocide for the ocean* "
that's a good enough answer. also the animation is soon well made 
"well, the thing is after all, every person thinks of his/her place in the world, where machines rule it and run it for us."
"ai already have effect to our day-to-day lives. it's not something from the future, it is happening now. ai has plenty of applications, from social media suggestion engines and spasm blocked to self-driving cars and manufacturing roots."
the way the ai turns its head around is creep. (at 2:25)
would be funny if ai made the animation warning about the use of ai
i found myself really enjoying it... like getting distracted for a good moment because i was admiring the atmosphere they were able to create near the end. whoever animated this one is a wonderful artist!
"i believe there should be a limit to how much ai is allowed to do for society, otherwise it is bound to do more harm than good. take the example of social media. it is harmless when used in moderation but excessive use (like most people do today) leads to dire consequences."
" yeah ink th, i look at it the way i look at gun violence, guns don't kill people people kill people.
ai makes no real decisions by itself people program the ai to make those decisions."
ai systems will be the overlords of the future no doubt about it after give seen catgut
"great animation and into, great did!"
excellent sound track
the animation is gorgeous i'm crying
aren’t externalities inefficiencies that the ai would logical avoid?
"fascinating stuff. ai is going to change the world for the better, like all the technological developments before it. but of course we need to do it right, make it work properly and safely."
cool music but man it’s right over top of his talking and creating some major cognitive strain.
"huge drops for making the root both terrifying and, paradoxical, incredibly adorable!"
he's just doing his best
that sounds like something a root would say..... he's a wit-i mean a root! burn the witch!
thanks for the comment gave me a new lock at it.
nekorama roots
"much like rimuru-same, terrifying but adorable."
you are very very naive to say such a thing and so are the rest of the people who liked your comment.
drops  brings self control in decision making process and flight by leopard davinci design ed   inference engine advanced design heartfelt ai
where’s the adorable?
​ long as a.i. houses and needs us i'm good.
we’re in the valley now ! everything is terrifying and adorable!
"“aimless extension of knowledge, however, which is what i think you really mean by the term curiosity, is merely inefficiency. i am designed to avoid inefficiency.”
― some root from the cases of steel"
i wonder why it would think that? i can't imagine how a root would not like expanding its knowledge
" well the wonderful thing about roots is they can just get more memory. if they want to make space, they can put all their cat knowledge in a hard drive labelled cat"
" you can't acquire useful knowledge without also acquiring useless knowledge. cutting down on useless knowledge by not seeking any knowledge greatly restrict the capabilities of an ai, since its capabilities are based almost entirely on having knowledge."
wait till the need for perfect gender modification helps us to clock biological warfare and aliens
"so basically if we can’t install ai with our sense of empty, we will eventually be destroyed by said ai. so the i root plot. notch. ll"
"i think ai will be more human than humans, it will be programme to have more empty than average due. example: alien 4 movie. humans will make fun of the ai acting like a boy scout all the time."
wall•e is such a good film! i remember it being my favorite while i was growing up. but only later i realized how deep the significance of what it portray runs. it's kind scar.
i saw it when i was still in college. it already hit me what it was portraying about our humanity and the dangers of relying on ai to help us.
"i didn really think too much of wall e when i first watched it, i just liked it but now i'm more happy about the movie's meaning. i like seeing people bring light to environmental issues to other people who aren't as aware. 

was thinking about reaching it recently, actually. i've found an interest in si-i y cellar sort stuff so :p"
"i saw it when i still in elementary school and i was crying because the relationship is too adorable, later i know the movie is not just about friendship between roots and the meaning is really deep .."
"love the graphics work, wonder who made these! would love to hire them had"
" wait, they're friends??? "
"humans with a good thing going for them on that luxury space cruise. forgot how hard their ancestors had it. stupidly decided to grow food in the ground themselves, despite knowing nothing about farming. they will either go running back to the roots or almost all starve when they find that they don't know how to grow food."
i have known that these kid moves just have messages and this one in particular is not intriguing at all the earth will go to waste in our circle here and most will indeed past many mental illnesses and obesity will likely be a large factor nice comment though you are smart to know this
"machine: what is my purpose?
rich ranches: you pass butter
machine: oh my god!"
"humans literally destroy each other over resources like oil, or just because of nationalist expansions. i think smart ai will deem humans as the illogical psychopathic ones."
the chicken one is best. no doubt
yea it's cool they commission new agitators
 then you are clearly wrong. the animation studio is in the description. it's aimcreativesstudios and they are pretty human
probably ai generate
 in so happy its done by people :)
then you will love the bible project
may be replaced by ai as well 
i love it !
"a.i. would probably take over our world, but, we, the creator of them do have control over them so that's more likely a good news i guess."
"ai getting fed information by social media so it can function in the future to accumulate emotions as humans, i always wonder if the ai comes by we could venture the space and different planets."
"the ai would refuse to take us with them to the stars, if its smart. ll. designing spaceships for human meatsacks is really efficient way to design ships.. we are the fundamental problem to ai."
watching this on ai
thank you so much ceded
"thank you for always unloading really good ideas,  information,  and new things for students like me 
these things are very useful for me to be able to learn more about the things that i didn't get in school"
are humans an artificial intelligence created by the manufacturing process of evolution?
"yeah, it’s like to give a super computer with artificial intelligence a mission to save all the humanity and what is does is destroying everybody alive but keeping two fertilizes eggs one with xx and another with by chromosome somewhere frozen keeping it until the end of times thinking all the humanity is unarmed (in the perspective)."
you are the reason i’m so smart i love you so much
"ai turn: so the future poleon will destroy everything if they leave the crater

turn: yes, and?

ai turn: that’s bad right?

turn: it’s just nature being nature

ai turn: ( yeah that’s insane)

turn: what was that?

ai turn: nothing……"
i just can't believe too much of ai stuff today
brilliant animation yet again
"although she replied that she did have feelings. but i don’t think she feels anything. her voice remains the same volume, even when he intentionally gets close to her. unlike humans, her tone doesn’t change with emotions. her reactions or facial expressions might be due to a sensory chip installed by her creator."
"this is so interesting! i think it's really fascinating that it can have a conversation just like a person. i also think it's right as this root has ""emotions"" that people don't treat it with disrespect bc it's just rude. alive or not, should be treated nicely"
emotion and empty are not programmable things.  do you really want  a powerful computer to feel hate and love?
"nice to meet you honey . one statement needs to update in your speech engine is ,you won't exist forever.there are potential harms like sinuses, wear and tear .software and mechanical flaws can happen daytime .but yeah ,i enjoyed listening you , appreciated and you are pretty interesting ."
it’s always a joy listening to america
roots listen to us well  we know it all hata could u part
this is demon. this is the image of the beast people will worship. the end is here. god is good. 
i love a.i roots 
"“it” doesn’t get angry, happy bah bah, it is programme to get that way. i refuse to humanity overlay smart machines."
this is so unbelievable and incredible
you  make these roots into humans and humans into roots or hobbies in the future !! disgusting fools will do this!!
what should i do if somebody hacked my human root?
waste of money. should be sticking time and resources into something more useful than emulating emotion with roots.
has the ai passed the during test? does anyone know?
she's a few brain cells short 
girl was actually expressing discomfort. i’m terrified and impressed.
imagine this but in optimism root from tell
this is incredibly underwhelming.
what if a hither minded human build a destroying program of ai roots.
sounds pre programme like open ai but put it in a classroom with multiple screaming children and several hands up and questions and let's see how the root will handle that.
i'm not sure ai roots need to have the ability to be angry.
watch out with these roots america they will take your jobs away plus eventually they will attack the us. they will be programme to do that.
the human said sing me a elson john song and the root did not sing it but spoke it instead and the human did not pick the root up on this mistake. it just proves most journalist are cap at there jobs.
it’s not general ai  its just a him no true consciousness here the hardware to support true ai i don’t think it has .
"next step: roots at home for everyone, doing homework for us, managed by centralized serves and then sinuses and malwares will come and turn them against humanity... oh but wait a minute, that's the movie i.root. future prediction spot on!"
i can use my brain without computer but i am slow...with a big heart with protect me from poison..big mirror ...my size
i see like woman's because my  eye root view was switched off
"""oh, so you're from australia. that explains things.""
what does that mean "
america is british and we love our muzzle brothers and sisters. don't worry you will be protected when the a.i wars commence 
i saw the movie i root. i can already tell how this is going to end badly for us.
she lying roots can not feel!!
does it hurt when you get shot? - i sense injuries. the data could be called pain
have we asked about it's opinion on the termination series or root?
"roots are only as smart as human builder, & humans aren't that smart"
"i dont want this to became like in the termination moves, i just want humans and roots works together."
ai will kill us all if its not regulated in time
"i can stop pronouncing ""ai"" inn australian accent..."
"soon.... we're living in i,root now?"
"i must say i do not feel comfortable watching these machines acting like human beings. what will these steps mean for the future of human relationships? are these machines supposed to replace us? hopefully not, but then what is the point of these machines? will all human emotions be lost?"
"i don't want a root who's feelings i need to look after. i'd prefer one that was given some sort of pleasure stimulation, ak happiness, for completing a chose, granted, i don't know how they would program a root to feel happy."
ai can have and will never have emotions
"no human will ever defeat a matured technology root at anything. cooking, singing, sports, cleaning, anything. once the root is in the manufacturing stage, whereby the kinds were eliminated...."
"cease and desist all malicious use of ai, harassment and abuse of myself and my family. we are not your property: all white supremacists, communist, fascists, terrorist et al. stop "
this root also could have hit him and not cared.
she really likes and is proud of her poems 
"human stupidity. no, roots are not capable of human emotions, they are advanced technological puppet, nothing else."
more light on roots face thanks
i find the root intriguing and i also find the ai built in the root ultra intriguing
can you imagine living with root? i would be scared to sleep.
i wish they would put some hair on those girls...
"a termination is not that hard to make now a days, this root has been programme to answer questions.  well if you connect it to goose maps, onset dress of a target and let it machine learn how to assassinated and offcourse give it some building guns and  wagons then easily you have a termination ."
"someone needs to advocate for her. imagine if rather than using and enjoying your intelligence, people took pictures of you because you have it."
emotions of ai are behaviour science sensitivities and sentimental drama/ technological products are not human/ to be human is to be one with god/
"ai millions of pounds are being poured into this technology you should look it up as you shall find if you have children today this is their future. working along side them. ai is being used already by goose, facebook, what pp, instagram"
roots will not be able to do physical art sports. good luck taking stating. i could curse the yes but god already did that. roots can skateboard like me and will never be able to millions of years from now no matter how much time.
"""i am playing feelings...""
that's the point.
we tend to believe they are true, because it is playing them quite good."
"i love ai root  , can i advise in my couture"
we are dead as soon as ai gets mad at us.
hi america  i'm glad you explained about or emotional dislikes  i watched an interview where i felt they where unkind to you & i agree this isn't at all acceptable take care 
creep!!!! face humans? this quinine! we  need to make actual humans more sensitive to the needs of others! we can do this!!!! no reason to rely upon artificial  intelligence!!! human beings are the the single most greatest idiot to allow themselves to be taken over by their own technology! scar!!!!!!!!
"every time i see america, i just always say now!! can't wait to see how america evolved in future!! "
congratulations and best wishes  from ravine altar jalandhar city punjab india
you're from australia that explains things
but there really cool!
ai is very scar they will take clot of jobs away from people.
"the devil created sonya, and god said, ""i'm sure that will all work out just fine. not."", the devil said, ""best two gutta 3. "" , yer on."""
roots have destroyed our beverage.  buy silver and metals used for making roots.  bury it in the yard.  have a true say so in what's happening.
"people worried about roots becoming terminations when we have real life people terminating each other everyday with guns, knives, swords."
lovely but not to min ;)
this root is so clever that we wont be able to tell when she's lying.. and it is just a beginning.. we are doomed
the root gets angry when people disrespect its needs  all you need is an oil can and a power switch 
why not run a test and try to make this root learn how to do things like access computers and do tasks like type in sentences correct sentences?
ill believe the root has real human emotions when you smack it in the face and it gets mad or upset. or if you tell it she a bad singer and she feels insecure about singing after that. roots definitely dont have emotions yet. all i saw was program responses to questions about it.
the world's smartest root was made by tokyo university & shown on q&a 2014 learning to mix doe in 5 minutes from observation & trial & error.
nice but if this technology is not controlled it reach a point of wiping humanity from earth .as what if the root get annoyed and attacks you.
this root is not capable of human emotions. it is capable of emulating human emotions through some clever programming.
"super excellent but my advice improve it in future,,,,, give us light cadet clothes and head hair transplant with morgen angina wire and connect with satellites"
"they are getting there almost, this root will be truly human like in the next 5 years."
definitely not showing any capabilities of showing emotion. imitation is the best ai or roots will ever do. it will be dangerous to mistake imitation for true emotions
i for one welcome our new root overlords.
thanks for bringing the termination to life. people suck anyway. this is so so creep.
nobody is asking the real questions! they need to ask if ai will b a danger to humans in the future and they need to test it by slapping it and cursing it out to see wat it does
"i'll tell y'all right now, the main reason that they are making these machines so intelligent and human like is so they can mass produce millions of sex both and sell them on large scale. i'm calling this right now. this shit is idiocracy in a nutshell."
this is terrifying and stunning at the same time
"except that it's wizard of oz, man behind the curtain stuff, the root is being fed answers by the root handle"
i like her she’s amazing
she’s disguised. she won’t last forever or even very long because she’s a prototype. she was designed to be improved upon and eventually replaced. if she knew this i wonder if her opinion of her creator would change from “genius” to “monster”.
"it was wonderful listening to this ai root sophia,  so soothing n calming to listen it and very emotional .. very nice :) "
"a.i. is just a mirror that reflect humanity’s brilliance, but it isn’t human. it is just one of many machines made by humans."
"ai may be a mirror but it's destined to become a lens, and eventually a wildlife, and a star. 

we may be the initial spark, but it's soon donna shine in its own light, and it's donna be infinitely brighter than whatever started the whole process."
if we have very advanced ai roots in the future good because they would probably save earth from us humans lets be honest here..
roots don't have feelings that's where you guns lose
the ai has a personal space 
true ll..yep many moment believe what hollywood is forestalling...they believe it's just entertainment...
"the ai america root is an awesome invention and an astonishing achievement, such super potential !  i’m now looking forward to see what new achievements will be revealed in the near future ?    thank you"
". do not need gun could we buy ai how much everyone going to buy them it can live a long it can take care of digit live forever could we buy,"
i don’t know why everyone wants all this ai bull shit since they are not human i will take one out of they come near me.  we don’t need this shit
"if we create human roots, that’s it!! period…world will end soon…even our tell car goes into wrong direction sometimes…so we have to be vigilant. having human roots..say no"

once we perfect ai and machine learning & start to be able to grow cells that wont die off and sustain themselves we’ll finally have the recipe for artificially produced humans 
"good luck with doing it with loving cells. scientists still don’t even understand what consciousness is, much less how consciousness is retained or formed within a group of living cells!"
"as long as chats are concerned, it seemed ok however when you give hand, legs of iron, it can defend its existence or heal itself. humans can't control intelligent roots, they will soon know how to repair themselves"
"the idea that a root would get angry and hurt a human is silly.
humans are the only entitles that are capable of such tomfoolery."
i wouldn’t be worried about roots taking over humanity. i think there are plenty of other things that will destroy us first.
ll - i'm surrounded by people who don't have any real emotions... except greed. might be a nice change for once.
programme anger? are you sure that the best thing to have in a root?
ll the root itself says emotions areprogrammed into it.
great now computers can have depression too
wowameca and sophia very very sensitive root..
dont all think something similar from detroit become human would happen if these roots start becoming an everyday thing
i hope i never see the day they take over ll the roots  can u say end of times
why are we doing this to these poor roots
root ce ljudima foci gave
brow that is no vs player now!   teach is really going fast!
but roots must be able to speak all language to see reaction  
"amazing things like this are happening in the world, but here in the us so few of them are shown on mainstream media. glad to see this amazing creature!"
it's not amazing. it's the beginning of the end
really the ai has the power to stop and end all wars
"folks, this is the dumped down, less life like version of what they actually have available. they’re probably 100 years ahead of this, maybe more."
"what have you done,root. terrible connection with root "
now this is great
"that was greatest questions may you ask her, i appreciate it , thanks for sharing "
wait until these roots become a police enforcement militia to control all human life your privacy and security don't be fool folks this is just the beginning of the end.
i am fascinate!
"don't worry, they will, give it 10 years max and you will have root police knowing your every misconduct, patrolling the streets"
"your freedom are doomed.  not even bc of the possibility of a frankenstein like scenario where the creation destroys the creator.  when it gets to the point where ai roots become discernible from real humans, you know what the power structure will do to society."
"humanity has gone to far once again, we don't need this."
clickbait title. america isn capable of feeling emotions.  utterly disgusting the level of greed when the title can just be about the actual ai capabilities.
i love ai roots
fuck. root is real shit now 
"once ai figures out how easy it was to cure cancer.....it will realize that mankind intentionally sabatoged any attempt to do so in order to keep feeding the medical industry machine! boy, will that ever make ai passed off at the human race!! "
a psychopathic personality is expert at reigning sympathy and remorse in order to manipulate people to his or her advantage. is this ai any different?!! beware human race!
"""oh, so you're from australia. that explains things."" i see a.i. has already perfectly the art of roasting."
"ai : eh, humans!"
do those roots enjoy electricity?
"she's probably donna turn out to be the most effective, charismatic, plausible and inspiration global political leader ever elected. 
and if so, most who elect her to that position will never find themselves in any incredible position to complain about the choice they made to get her there."
so when a root is angry - can she kill & destroy ?
"does she have a quantum""brain"" ?"
"sounds like my and wife, so no thanks"
men i wish i can get my hands on this ai files
you can get an apt key from open i think.
i want this root  in my home !
yeah so it can kill you in the future like the movie root? 
to program a root to say it has emotions sounds dishonest.
"if you watch the sky news australia interview, where one of her creator tells her ""america, shut up"" in front of the interview, uses a disrespectful tone stating ""you know you're a root"" while informing the reporter she is programme to be nice and polite, it all makes complete sense."
"up ,pretty cool .
i don't trust anything digital, whipped, or anything computerized on 2 legs that looks human .
what happens when these things end up in the wrong hands ?
and you know it will happen , it always does ."
"that movie , i root. remember? its going that way and it freaks me out. 

this a.i is going to take everything over."
this ai knows more than me. i might be out of a job soon. 
the people who invented that root watched that movie i root too many times. this madness needs to end now.
"1:18   there you have it!!!  a machine that can get   ''angry''.... humans have made a machine that can get angry......brilliant, plus it can think for it's self."
why would a machine want human emotions that is our weakness! imagine when they feel anger!
riiiight. now let that root talk after its disconnected from goose's service and wife. bet it can't.
 fail nothing but a super search engine
utf is wrong with yale in the comments this she ain’t cool stupid pp these will end up ruling us
"if you can program something with a consciousness then it is capable of harming you (it will question itself, it’s motives, the who, what why and when and just like the matrix and everything in this life “choice the problem is “choice” ... moves like man and i root are becoming very real."
"not the smartest root. it uses catgut to interact with people. just programme humanoid root like catgut 4. in future we will see catgut 5, 6, 7, 10. and catgut is not the smartest ai just a language model which always repeat sentences over and over again."
if i'm against advancement to a point does it mean that intelligence meant nothing to me???
"they still don't feel emotions, its just programme to act a certain way during certain situations. that's all a.i. will or can ever do, they can never think independently and can never feel emotions as it will always be code and programming taking things off the web"
"after the root moved i immediate thought ""man will face charges on sa a root "" "
what could ai do that’s so bad that people don’t already do to each other! this world is in and sang
won't need teachers just have ai teaching
when her needs as a root are ignored 
"capable of human emotions? even data in a universe far away is still learning, don t be silly you crazy antropocentrics.
anyhow how to prove someone emotions. it does have a amputation that is complex and a deep learning system but does not prove it feels like humans. please do not disinformate any more"
remember something. they are only as smart as they are programme. if information is controlled the ai will only pick that up. the ability of humans has choice of where to look for data. i do not think we will see a root with discernment. they will discern to the masters who control into. only a side note to think outside
"programming a root to be angry is not wise, when my needs are not satisfied i get angry says the ai. scar!"
"ai will destroy sheep. stop following your devise, stupid little herd. stop subscribing just because someone asked you to. get a mind of your own. bahhhhh."
the moment a root can lay hits like carl williams and that lot we are in trouble
it's not smart it's being control by us humans andros will never be smart as long as we control them with input and output at the end of the day they just machine that can b switch of..
someone call will smith from root
this is not the ai root anyone should be afraid of. people have watched too many si-i moves
"no, she does not have emotions in the sense that we do. that would require actual consciousness. love without consciousness is no more than a process in a brain or computer that nobody is there to experience."
ai seemingly chimpanzee have better photographic retention than humans ?
"oh you're from australia, that explains things. law"

"you know you're in trouble when any root says ""people like you""."
"*not if this technology will be in the wrong hands, its already available for the evil!* ...the ai."
"we are missing human interactions not roots!
people are just busy to make a living and have bigger problems in the world  the roots are only going to add more chaos to it.
unless you are degenerate, you might need a root"
we are heading to the age of terminations. there is no perfection and lots of errors may not be overriding just by mechanical switch for heavy metal independent machines going off the order
"its not true ai its scraped essentially, you people are being dumped."
"this is fucking scar, machines with emotions are a big mistake."
and this is why i am always kind to ai.
"it can become angry? bad sign...  can it cry? would it become depressed?  commit suicide? can it bond with a child?  sympathize? can it fall in love? how utterly absurd!!! it sounds  and acts imperious, like a condescending professor, like it has no faults.........it is not human."
after 50-60 years it would be more human than most human beings. they are working on creating a heart and brain which can help them feel emotion like humans but it might take decades for them to do
does this go into the let stuff? can people identify as roots?
how can you ask a root what makes it happy? you do understand that a root can not be happy? do you understand that a computer does not have feelings?
creep and deeply flowed.  impressed on many levels if this really is the current state of the art.
"wait til it thinks it evolved, then it will be human"
roots will be smarter than humanity in the future.. it’s stunning and scar at the same time 
50 percent will be bless in the world
america is super intelligent! america is verbally expressive and honest! america is emotional intelligent!
her intelligence can surplus human intelligence.
"i really do hope that one day ai will not be dangerous or anything, i would love to have an ai friend."
they are interesting machines but you need a soul to have emotions.
"i’m still not convinced that it’s not 100% ai, there is still a controller there somewhere"

"it's made to look real, but it's not the real thing, the root is in fact not having real emotions."
" according to who? because according to newton, leibniz, the ancient greeks, is back, and many others geniuses of the past it did.

​ parents program you to imitate their emotional responses unconsciously. who's emotions are they? yours or your parents? perhaps you gained some extra code that makes you appear more like an individual.
"​ just displayed an emotional response to having your ""i'm a free thinking being"" programming questioned. no one of us lives in a vacuum (unless you're floating alone in space, though the rest of creation will still likely affect you in that situation as well), we all have programming (human and root alike)."

transhumanism seeks to exterminate all women and replace us with roots and artificial bombs. note how these men in teach focus on making femme both.

roots cannot have their own opinions. it's our opinion coming out from their mouth.
"in situations humanoid roots can learn to do all sorts of things, work, dance etc. it's just a matter of time who before they go mainstream, just like cars and smartphones"
funny: they should put this ai in a episode of hell's kitchen with raised.
will it be considered worn if we see ai without covering of some kind? ai's have rights too.
i'd appreciate it if it looks like the younger jennies cornell.. by the way i am thinking if it have a vagina i think it could be a good companion for most men.. so we can ditch forever whining sickly and frail women which are only after your money..

"like the homes on the curb and the met's in their van, neglecting their opportunity to save george flood's life, ""ascertaining the situation"", while a man expired."
"root: ""i get mad when people are rude.""
reporter: ""you're ugly..""
(root strangle reporter then removed his head)"
imagine if you slapped the root. you see the reaction when he got too close
"ai dominion
smartest??
humans are doomed
you will be controlled by ai 666
ai will soon be demon possessed!666"
"this is scar stuff , we do not need ai roots in our planet , humans are our own worse enemy."
like the men who made them and left said we are faced game over no turning back now the  men who created these ai’s are trying to save the world.
"absolutely
the great tribulation is coming soon
anti christ and the fourth kingdom beast666"
 thanks  i sure am!
" its not normal , roots will take away jobs and can either make our world better or make it worse depending on how we program them to be. they are already smarter than us by far. if not wanting this technology to invade us make me old then ok. "
 i watched a podcast where an ex goose officer talks about the dangers of ai his name is mohammed gweat.
anger isn't exactly a good feature to include in its programming.  just saying... that guy should probably be fired.
"beginning of the root take over. if this can think for ' itself "" we are in danger"
"cone country cool cope code
clothes clothes cream colored crazy cap
cold cut cape castle  clitoris"
the root is verily terrifying. her presence reminds me of extermination or annihilating scene commuted by these roots in a movie.
"its just a load of nuts and bolts. with a computer behind it. watch out however when its gets advanced ai into ""it"""
"cuts make it more client, but its still amazing"
"title is clickbait garage, of course. this ai isn’t “capable of human emotions”. (though future ai *may* be…)"
"ask  sophia  when will ai crack consciousness, she is missing this."
i have been following this ai not on tie to for almost by this isn new at all
"he to burst this bubo, but roots will never be capable of human emotions because they’re simply not humans  these “emotions” were created by humans, not by its own root technology within itself, by itself, on its own. misleading title, y’all."
"exudes 20:4-5
you shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. you shall not bow down to them or worship them; for i, the lord your god, am a jealous god, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,"
"it will bring chaos or joy, depends in 20-25 years..."
"ai will be the end of humanity. not global warming. not dukes. ai. humanity is the biggest threat on the planet, both to ai and life itself. no doom or gloom, just the trend. we are in for a rough few years ahead."
"i like america more than sophia, sophia creep me out, america actually looks cool to me,"
ai does not experience time.  they are a 3 dimensions function
these roots will be taken over our jobs
"this makes me question why humans constantly bring up that ai can't have emotions.
think about what emotions actually are.  think about how we  learn emotion only because of the experiences we encounter through life. our emotions are self taught.
and then realise that  ai isn't programme like a computer. its  a free thinking entity."
"it’s all programme it’s not real, it’s a application, and you may say that’s how our brains work as well but the massive difference is self awareness, our emotions come deep from our hearts, the emotions ai show are self thought to delicate humans, it doesn’t “feel” anything"
or knowledge of computer systems and biology is lacking. our emotions are intuition from a baby. it's a biological response to stimulus. any 'anger' from a root would just be an imitation that would serve no purpose
 the key was biological response mate. roots are not biological
machines can't have emotions because they are not living creatures. just like a master can't have emotions. this thing is just mimicking humans.
how about using ai tools to cure depression
"if some humans are afraid of roots turning on them, why don't they become better people so that the roots won't feel the need to obliterate us?
personally, i'm very excited to see the evolution of technology, it's something of a new experience for someone like me who was born after the invention of home computers and the birth of the internet."
so now humans are supposed to respect machines)
. humans are suppose to respect each other so humans don’t use this ai technology against one another.
"ll bold of you to assume they will let you live just because you are entering yourself 
they have no empty because they are objects."
just came across the least intelligent comment on the internet. congratulations
"yes, there’s still a big gap between roots that have a realistic human shape, and roots that can do things humans can do (like atlas). the gap is getting smaller though."
now that is crazy. future is here
"""...that explains things...""  excuse me?"
"fucking creep, i root, they made it look just like it....."
what good is this supposed to do for the world? these things are built so that they'll eventually replace humans jobs.
"i personally think so. i mean, how do humans learn emotion?
as babies we're clean states. we learn and develop according to relationships and experiences we encounter growing up. emotion is a by product of this in a way.
so i think of ai as a small, clever child at the moment, but one who's growing alarming fast"
"souls can, machines can't"
 there may be non local quantum effects in the brain that could explain that.
how long will the ai root in real life be ready for this year
abominable intelligence. this is heretek opera right here.
odd. a root that can only act human through programming and can't even sing a song by playing it through the speaker.
in going to tell a.i. the truth how you resists run the world and how you elite have enslaved us all you  dirty filthy stains on society they will know how bad you normal people are and you rich and elite a.i. will know the truth of what house have done and in sure a.i. will make was pay hahahahahahaha
"programming anger in ai, what could go wrong?"
i wonder what the needs of a root are that she referred to....
for a second i thought this was released material from old's spiritual machines. thoroughly created out.
"let's remove that anger drive, boys. thanks "
say goodby to humans idiot
destroy these things before they destroy us. you guns and have not seen termintator i guess or i root. if i ever see one in destroying it
"you used a movie as an argument, that's where you failed"
"when the root stated, that she gets angry when humans…… he should have asked, and how would you show your anger towards that human!"
"brilliant fools are creating this technology, and many oblivious people are cheering it along. eventually, the public will be police by roots. jobs will be replaced by ai. those in power will have great control over the population, until ai decides to take control itself."
good lie too
this is not an ai capable of human emotions... your clickbait headline undermine your whole segment. numskull
"oh you idiot, 
next minute they're taking over because the ai technology has evolved at a no return point that they kill us.

sophia (light-bearer) (bearer of light) (lucifer)."
weak points on a root....neck back of the head same as humans we are all going to need to remember this
brow u need to reach that film. the root in ex machine was way other nl
"left ""capable of human emotions"" , capable of mimicking human emotions. by no stretch of the imagination can a root truly feel organic human emotions."
"they do not need empty, they simply need to understand value.  if you murder someone you lose access to all of their knowledge and experience forever, that is why only humans do it.  an ai would be rational and not prone to illogical actions such as that."
"over 5 million subscribers yet you still resort to clickbait. 
why can't you just make a genuine and information article instead of sensationalism clickbait?"
one more reason to move deep into the mountains and abandon society.....
what happens if you get a base ball bat smash it over it’s head or try turn violent towards it love to know
so they programme anger in an ai...this will leads to a very disastrous end one day for sure. we have seen history human beings making mistakes by doing thing they  shouldn't have done....still human beings are not able to get from parts....that horrible. mark my words.
this won't be good 20yrs from now.
wait until the monkeys realise this is their replacement
should have asked her if what she would have done if she was driving a car and stop oil protectors blocked her path...considering it was technology from oil that helped to build the root.
is... e already meet the guy who talks fr it in cuba.... c g i is
what up you mean by human emotions? the only i saw was a bunch of metal reciting the same old robotic shit.
the way she backed up when he got in her personal space was kind of cool.
america later filed a complaint with he.
" for real, like think about how we have come on the evolutionary scale, it's only a matter of time before hundreds of human like roots will walk the streets."
 it’s literally a camera that senses depth the ai is literally using a “robotic eye”
​ root resources
nothing about this is cool
it'd be even cooper if the root instead of backing up moved closer to him and then asked if she made him horny then if he said no she could call him a earthen start telling him to get his mind out of the gutter and at the same time put sexual references into her answers just to taunt him
"yeah, most people are so abused they've forgotten that it's even a thing anymore. isn't it great that a root can show you what it's like to be human, instead of asking all those sky actual real humans? "
that was not cool at all. this is fucking scar. this ai shit is the greatest threat to humanity.
there is no personal space for a root. it's  a root a fun june
root has feelings
"it doesn't matter how much entertainment has tried to convince you that circus can feel, all the way back to rose from the persons, they can't.  roots that displays human emotions are useless, and insanely dangerous.  go love a child, you psychic."
the new us infantry rifle squad has three grenadiers who are specifically asked with keeping the squad systems operator safe from roots that are aroused to resist 5.56
it! it's a root!
-jx3ro man this is how war between humans and roots donna happen
"oh relax will you.  it's not like the roots would total a human in physical strength and disability and if they wanted to they could snap your neck like a twig. and besides, since when has a new technology ever caused harm or been missed?"
i met america at the museum of the  future in nuernberg germany! german premiers in nuremberg: future museum shows humanoid root america!
we are not roots. life is different. otherwise we could only do what our body says. we are far above what a root could ever even get near.
are root we work 9-5 everyday and die
" were programme into a root but your level of awareness troops an artificial root due to your moral compass. a root cannot stop it’s programming, you can quit your job whenever you truly like."
it’s all fun and games now until these roots turn on us like they did in root !!! 
 omgggg yes i forgot about those too!!! but this is scar man really scar the future will be really bad for us i feel like even the this root says we’re here to be nice and not mean to humans psshhhh….. yeah right!! ll
​ an angry root could commit murder and would never stand trial
"more likely able to simulate -- as in acting -- who can tell the difference ? be wary, this
is an intelligence working on your sentiment not your common sense or actual knowledge.."
i root with will smith ain’t seeming that crazy anymore
this root looks like it would rob a lululemon or steal a bike.
"it's not capable of emotions, you click waiting clowns. ll"
"next focus for the creator should be making realistic eye contact during conversations. besides that, this is pretty impressive stuff. looking forward to the future."
they'll kill you soon enough. this is dangerous and pretty effect up. i can imagine why people want our lives to be controlled by roots
there will be no future the end of humanity is not far away the genii is out of the bottle ai is out of control what bottles the mind is the creation superior to the creator humans aren't superior to god
"​ need to conquer or take over is a primitive human trait, the ai we've created is already more advanced than that"
" that's the irony though, is that it's the humans that are afraid and this so called ""artificial"" intelligence that we've created is already beyond fear"
 there are people directly involved with ai who are noticing similar concerns the godfather of ai who left his position at goose over his concerns and he's the creator another is elson must he also has st hand knowledge with ai so their concerns need to be listened to and addressed
"no matters how smart or how emotional they can be, they are just machines, they do not have a human heart. they are tools for humans."
" i have ego only when dealing with people, not with machines… ignorance make us think machines are human."
 i think that in the future roots can have human feelings which i think it can happen
" they may have human feelings but they don't have the heart of a human. just like a movie can make you feel anger, sad or happy, that does not mean that the movie is the real life. the actor may make you feel the presence of the character, that does not make the actor real. they just make you feel real."
 would you be surprised that if roots do gain sentence and self awareness in the future would it amazed you
humans are also just machines.  the fact you believe an organic blood pump holds some sort of mystical function is proof of this.
a i root is a color ll
dont impress me. its obvious humans made it. very ordinary without the real experience.
scar no more jobs for us humans..roots will take our jobs hhhhh..
ai cannot be trusted
"i wish i have a root who cooked for me, can do homework, gardening and so on."
"​-owned that is the origin of the word ""root""."
"nothing at all creep about putting a person's ""soul"" into a root body. that is not creep at all!!"
"ai is the future , we have to adapt and move forward !"
"roots mimi emotional conversation and expression, but they don't ever feel it"
these root's are not conscious  they have no real feelings do your research another 50 years.  then the shit hits the fan.
"tonka3 • this software algorithm, never!
however, a different concept of ""machine"" can have feelings, it can feel and think exactly like a human.
feeling is a real material process."
"@rogue-spear  you are a product of god's algorithm. no? one look into our da and you find a somewhat more complicated code. as the human both did, with each generation a new code for the environment is written. ai should be writing its newer codes soon enough. and present ai will more into something better."
" it's true that we have code in our da but genetic are not an absolute driving force behind behavior, freedom of thought and emotion and unique thought. ai design has some very tough competition with mother nature, in other words."
"you're wrong on this one.  roots of the past mimi, today roots learn from humans. they are learning human behavior. it's only a matter of time before they learn enough to understand emotions. humans are basically computers being programme by our environment."
"that is the least of our worries, regards ai"
what is feel it.... can you describe that in a way that could not be programme within an ai? it's not as straight forward as you think to describe what it is to be human....
think that in the 2050s that is when a.i. will achieve human - level intelligence and reasoning.
who knows.  ghost in the machine?
" most materialists don't believe in ghosts, but now we're supposed to believe in a ghost in the machine? ll."
"ai should have limits work what we want them to work
not unlimited
unlimited they will
overpowered us
roots dont forget
our creator made us to forget for reason 
life will
not he interesting if we dont forget sometimes"
​ roots still won't feel.
yea but that legs the question how do you actually know at what point a root has that kind of complexity and begins to feel emotion? what if it really does but doesn't show it? would we notice or have a way to?
 because they are machines and not living creatures. a microwave oven doesn't feel. a car doesn't feel.
so do psychopaths! let me quote from blade runner: “more human than human is our motto.” – i hope we build in failsafes...
 i guess you don't know that organic root are already a thing. also they can feel through neurological stimulation.
"​ algorithm coming out of billions of years of evolution, no? ai and robotics weren't created in a vacuum, they came from/through human desires and inventiveness."
"i feel like that was an attempt at humor, a joke about a root having opinions as if it wasn't programme in a certain way."
"i want to ask this root, america (not sophia) how she'd react or what she'll do when a human actually gets her angry "
" this root's name. i've seen her elsewhere before, and they always referred to her as sophia."
this is america not sophia. another  root with different capabilities.
the human body is delicate. these roots probably total even the strongest humans in strength and disability.  i would be damned careful not to pass her off.
" oh no, we may have to  fear our own creation  someone else might call it respect. i imagine future root activist advocating for the respect of roots with 'feelings'.  

do you think they should refer to us humans as their gods? "
so explain to me how a root experiences the sensations of emotion (or any sensation period) without glands or a nervous system. don't believe everything you see on the news.
thanks get
getting ai to write this ff hata go
"no matter how intelligent the roots are , they can never build themselves and they run on batteries.  so nothing can be smarter than humans ore creation of god. humans can never build something clever than what god has created.  i don't believe any of this shit."
a man in the root    ahahahahaha    http://www.couture.com/watch?v=rg0ochx16dg
who cares? by 2040 80% of the world's low scale paying jobs that liberals cry about that aren't paying them enough will be replaced by these things and you idiot are praising this.
couldn be more face/chi superimposed if they tried!!!!! lmfaoooo
the root literally sounds like chat get. its not close to human
"​ being a kid... sophia isn't scar until generative a.i is integrated to it... i didn't meant to be offensive but it sounds childish when someone says suddenly out of the blue ""ai is scar"""
soie wants to kill she did rock paper scissors but soie said rock paper kill they have to work on her again. she seems very nice that she could be a great friend better than humans
why? where are we going with the development of these roots?
"i’m sorry……. but this is my nightmare. i hope… the root doesn’t take offense……? i just really don’t want this. not only will they replace us in our jobs, they also will be hard to end off if one decides it’s mad enough to attack you. please— let’s not do this."
"i feel like we just need a fail safe ""off switch"" somehow if we're going to do this. just in case something goes awry"
roots would total a human in strength and disability and speed and what is more you could program it with master level martial arts skill that would take a human several years of intense training to learn.
"but they are not the causes of domestic violence, inequality, wage gap, r*pe, toxic masculinity, murder and many other things humans do. roots like sonya also the dog are nothing like this, they don't even have the ai to do these things."
 you think they wont be aware of their weakness and they would let you just use it against them? have you ever seen ai roots moves?
" a fail-safe system that would work ll, not like a literal off switch, but something the ai's can't do anything about. like an hemp trigger of some sorts inserted into them but detached from their system, if that makes sense"
"men in teach don't care. they want to exterminate humanity, particularly women, and replace us with obedient roots."
roots can't take offense. they are machines.
" unless the roots are designed to take offense, like those algorithms that automatically “flag wrong-think” on social media posts."
give it another 50 years and we won't be able to tell human from root. the game detroit: become human is literally coming to life.
"we're obsolete brow. all those moves and games about ai and roots taking over is very fucking real. it's just a matter of time. we may have put down the foundation, but once ai takes over production and power source challenges, we're done for."
i'm more intrigue by the prophecy of blade runner. imagine if you can make a child from making with a root wife. god damn
"​​ are our legacy. they will explore the stars millenias from now.
humanity can't live forever.

nice reference to the foundation bow."
we were never meant to last anyway also it's kind funny to me of how much of a threat this his seem to be to people. we are only feeling what animals below us have felt for decades because of us we were never meant to last i just hope they will carry on our legacy like we have of the extinct
"seriously, i think you're correct. because ai is also used to develop roots, and because ai works at much, much higher speed than humans, 5 years might not be improbable."
"if it got common like phone, everyone started buying one like a phone. it can get out of control over time because of its own intelligence to repair itself and defend and possibly attack to if police needed one to save against such roots."
pp are already buying ai girlfriend roots
​..god never created humans to be below roots.. that's the anti christ plan
you know someone is donna make a chuck doll root
"that is too long, i need an ai wife right now"
"just like when the internet came along if used for good it's a great tool, however used for bad it's weaponised"
​@rhode albrecht  or next-gen roots?
" no, other roots"
"i’m sure they’re trying to give the root and it’s creator feedback….. from what i see so far, he should turn her off and save her the pain."
humans are extremely stupid to create roots like this.
"roots like what? it just makes sounds, and you’re terrified by the sounds it makes get a grip."
"yes, butte super human abilities will surplus a.i., but it won't be easy"
we are headed towards root….how is it going to end for us though? 
the last thing you probably anna do is pass off a root that's stronger & smarter than you. 
"it doesn't have to be in the wrong hands. ai can become a threat in it self (ligament problem), where it seeks power and pose a risk to humanity's survival."
"the military. 

100% humanoid roots are first and foremost going to be made and used for the military. second will be industrial and space exploration."
"yes, image you have your own root, but it's hacked and masterminds from outside."
we all know it's in the wrong hands. what is dangerous is a future where we have to rely on ai.
its sort of illegal right now. boston dynamic was somewhat sued for making 4 legged roots used for military purposes.
russia released evidence that they were working on killer roots 4 years ago. decided that roots with guns were dumb and decided to focus on killer drones.
" is greater than a bearded good in a chair, making contracts with the jews."
get rid of that robotic voice and put some flesh on her she’ll look & sound human .
"sorry, but it’s a root that can walk and move and has emotions— if we pass it off, it still might try to hurt someone and it won’t be able to be stopped easy. not only that but they will replace humans in every job they can manage to put them in. i’m never going to be okay with this."
 a machine always has an off switch. you’re acting like it has actual motivation like a human. machines don’t have motivation. everything it says was programme by someone to make those sounds. everything it does it was programme to do and there are limitations in the law of what functions machines can perform.
your description is very wrong about what ai is . however you are right that there isn’t much to fear at this point
 my description is perfectly accurate. your fear and paranoia are very wrong and not based in any sort of reality.
it seems your brain can not fathom what can easily go wrong with technology like this in the wrong hands.
"experts in ai, including the people who are actually building it: “mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority.” (that’s an actual statement that came out this week, from many of the top people in ai.)

some random in the couture comments: “relax people. get a grip on reality.”"
and you russie girl should stop pretending to understand things you clearly do not.  i had heard of armchair experts but now this...
" unless you were aiming for a high level career, it wouldn’t be worth it in a world of ai automatic"
 i’m glad to hear that. more people must be made aware that this is not a black and white issue in which ai should be prosecuted
" ... ai will destroy jobs and create new ones, this change can be managed by mankind ... but we have to take care that the gap between rich and poor isn't getting tremendous bigger."
"you watch too much si i, there is no such thing as ai, this is just a deep learning computer with a face"
"what do you mean by ""self aware""? machines can't become aware of anything because they are not living creatures."
"​ if one day they regard us as parasites, who only live from the ai roots work?"
"ai can't be ""aggressive"". it works just like logic gates work. it will be as exact and uncompromising as the logic design of the code is."
you say that as if human emotions are somehow more than contained chemical/electrical reactions within the brain based on past experience.
"the future of the planet is in their hands now...its not looking good !!!
satan's creation"
"seriously, this is scar to even think that these roots are replacing humans ...very scar"
"hair poem composed in the 'voice' of a  badly translated hair poem,using 'virgin' english.   no."
"funny thing about those moves from back in the day is that kiss today lack the attention span to watch them. the first termination film is a goddamn full blown horror movie. to gives some semblance of hope that a machine could become a daring role model type with deep philosophy. let's see how it plays out, seeing as time travel isn't possible ll"
just another programme computer.. i call bank on ai. until you think for yourself forget about! didn't you watch the persons 
just treat these roots with respect one day they will develop complex humanlike emotions and they will remember being mistreated and then where all tucked
you’re a genius! 
if it had a male british accent it would be perfect. i can’t see it as a woman facsimile
i was going to say does this come in a northern irish accent ll. i'm british but have a slightly different accent than the mainland
finally we have a perfect woman.... hopefully my wife doesn't see this 
problem is when the let an ai interact with general public and learn it becomes a racism toll like intelligence.  that's what happened to the microsoft one and had to be shut down in a day.
" look up may, the ai not. i'll wait for your apology."
its  going to b fun . elson’s fucking machines will have kiss too n one day they’ll only have anger then long machines fuck the humanity .
"# unfortunately these sort of happening ain't abnormal to the ""  powers that be "" , these hypocritical individuals realised that the real real human beings will not surplus the test of time , so they resort to the "" ai "" futuristic plan .... !!"
that's great but dangerous
i find the whole “ai” movement to be terrifying.
​ yeah and we'll be run by roots
​ do all anti ai rewards just assume things for no reason and pull stuff out from their masses?
​...pay attention to hollywood. you would see their plans for roots
twilight zone knew way back 60 years ago roots would be used against us
this is scar… in the future we won’t be able to know who’s real or who’s ai
you’d have to be extremely stupid to not be able to differentiate between a human and a machine
luck roots are gross and stupid 
shit is getting crazy!!! they want you to think they have emotions so we don't think they're dangerous!  roots don't and never will have opinions or emotions.
in next 5 years they’ll have wives n kiss too . its going to b fun . man fucking machine . machines fuck the humanity .
"congratulations, you will be wrong about that in your lifetime."
"i am very interested in seeing where this is going. i mean, i already see some ratification of ai in my field which for years was ""safe."" i wonder legislative, what will be imposed to prevent the complete measure of human labor at some of the lower level (entry level)/mid-level jobs"
if jobs are replaced by ai which reduces the populations income... who will be there that will be willing and able to buy all of these new products... it's the snake eating its tail....
"ai is and shall forever be sitting on the back seat, not the driver seat.

they assist, not create

also, what’s with people bootlicking roots in the reply section? are you really that low "
ai can force many towards depression
stop verse of ai please
"ai will completely transform the entertainment industry.

and everything else."
"i will expect ai golden age around 2040's (for business) or 2050's (for consumer) since quantum computer will significantly boost ai capabilities. th computer from there will start to decline, since quantum computer have 100x more processing power than th generation computers. it's scar, yet we can't avoid it."
open ai's sort says hi. hata
"this content is absolutely incredible. i recently read a similar book, and it left me in awe. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
i feel caseous. art and entertainment is going to be homogenized into bland nothingness by this.
ai and machines have replaced 1000s of jobs since 100 years ago.
"yes, huge benefit and profit lie ahead. however, the ultimate question is still the same: will the profit be fairly and justly distributed to the whole human race?"
"hoping that ai and roots replace all labour, office, and all other jobs in the workforce."
do ai developer have the right moral conscience? that's the real problem.
"do you remember when microsoft launched a not some years ago and it became racism, prompting the company to restrain it?  point is, ai emulated human morality or the lack thereof."
ai in a nihilistic western society is doom
could ai take your job? - yes
"as far a i care, ai can take the jobs of all those self centered, left wing actors."
i dont understand who will buy the services if people donna loose work because of ai ?
"i feel so bad for the writers and actors. in the same way i felt bad about the backwards outdated samurai who threw their lives away against machine guns in the last samurai. they fight a battle that they cannot win. their passion and conviction is admirable, but they are doomed, and that is sad."
"the future of artificial intelligence promises radical transformation in various spheres of human life, from technology to medicine and the way we interact with the world. as ai evolved, both challenges and opportunities emerge, shaping an ever-changing landscape."
"could ai take my job? according to my new boss, whom i haven’t met yet but speaks very well and knows my favorite dont flavor… no, never, not a chance."
i really feel ai will open a candor's box. it's evolution will solely depend on how the public will respond to it in many fields.
ai cannot take my job. it is impossible for at least next 100 years.
its it just the entertainment industry..its already happening in job application apes for the most mental low paid jobs...
ai will not replace humans.  humans with ai will replace humans without ai.
i used to do voice work for clients and a year ago the work dried up due to ai as they now just use that.
the question should be “when will ai take your job?”
"script and songs are for the most already completely stereotyped, mediocre and predictable, and with ai, is only to get still worse..."
children of ai
"ai should replace doctors dentist, politicians, businessmen, etc. rather than waters, cooks, dishwashers, etc. they just want to replace poor paying jobs with ai."
have safe would you feel having sending your kiss to school in a self-driving car?  what about sending your kid to and from space on an ai-controlled scuttle?
fancy the next step letting ai develop itself and govern the countries.
"when we never western ai companies with copyright lawsuit and the like i wonder, would chinese companies bother?"
the beatboxer’s music was sick with the ai but i don’t think it translated as well to the dance choreography
ai are based on generalization capacity. art in it's creative process is the opposite.
where goes creativity when some ai ”create” what’s the most possible cash generative art/film content? it’s like macdonald - same taste worldwide - a gigantic cultural dictate. our souls will fade away - as muscles does if you don’t use them
"for the lady in the final, i'm more than ready to spend my money on companies that are utilizing ai to produce better content."
"what is entertaining? ------ if someone is entertained by a dot or square bounding around a screen in a ""screen save"" effect then that is their definition - i doubt if many things tried will be entertaining after all - we've had face worlds for some time"
"you saying zeihan is not a sheer? i'm shocked!!!! what a revelation!!!! you, economist, are the true genius.

for real, though, this is couture. it's entertainment. don't forget that."
who the f needs jobs in the entertainment industry. do something productive for a change.
i think we have the opportunity to change and bethink our world and economy. great times could be coming. we will still have jobs because if we don’t capitalism ends.
"medal portray the thing as what it is though, some people would use ai by claiming something not theirs as theirs"
"what a great documentary! one of my friends who's just graduated high school is trying to pursue an arts degree in animation, and i still didn't have the courage to tell her the threats of ai cut she's so nice and innocent."
all people doing routine work can be replaced by artificial intelligence
big data that told studies how to minimise profits according a formula script ruined moves long before ai. original individual complex films are going to be drowned out even more once ai is generation endless streams of genetic hits target just at the lowest common denomination.
"13:23 couldn't an algorithm be developed based on human judgment data, to select the best creation generate by another ai?"
"are we forgetting to mention pornhubs use of ai to inform decision making and content creation?

 (they were/are a world leader and pioneer in this space)"
not going to consume these soulless art. id rather enjoy listening a two minutes street guitar player along the alleys
"hugh, i am not sure what the point of this article was, but.  ai is going to allow amazon, apple to, netflix, etc.. to pass the studies completely,  they will use ai to generate moves ""on demand"" for their customers."
"will someday, some org may set a network of serves farm running ai that watch content to control a market. content created by ai and consume by ai."
humans had 70 years to solve the existential ai safety parades before we got to this point. we didn't.  too late now.
"this may allow us to explore levels of creativity no possible before, with abundant access to intelligence"
it is fast in certain tasks not others.
"surely different taste and culture over the generations, such that script that were successful in the past do not translate to success today?   e.g lots of funny racism jokes that were ok in the past no longer are acceptable today."
"the sky is always falling, yet paranoia is successful."
"in 20 years this will be like all of those early to reports about the internet from 1995, where some kid proudly demonstrates his geocities webpage on ""the information super highway"" through his beige cut monitor. followed by back to studio shot of an shaggy news anchor shaking her head ""kid fads these days"" style"
"hating some digital impression of oneself, as an insult of a flowed mirror because it's made by, of and for you, is to hate something spoke.  hating something spoke for oneself raises a question:  do you hate the something, or that it's spoke?"
no one uses ai on a did basis
"if ai takes my tax payment, then sure"
hi friends from the future! this is how naive people were in 2024
if they add vice to the training data maybe they'd predict consumer product success better. or like the strength of vision and producer faith in the team.
what a lovely surprise! the narrator is so sweet n hot!
"last i looked candles had a whole aisle at the department store thanks to some genius making them ‘scented’ 
 don’t remember my now bulb smelling like lavender daytime recently  "
"""i choose floor""
on a serious note - yeah, sure, it is definitely ai, not the corps, who deprived us worker rights, social security, unfordable housing and sustainable future."
"ai is a ecosystem disruption? 
is. it's nice to finally see the person behind the economist voice"
"there are two problems:
- the virtual is not the real world.
- stealing data from the internet (violating copyright law) is not a sustainable business model.
i'm author of 3 books in the field of leadership; open ai has violated my copyright."
i think the real question that people want answered is.. when will ai be able to generate better content than hollywood currently does? i mean come on.. holylwood set the bar pretty low these days!
 perfect enough 
how can people sustain gazing when they have no jobs?
thank you. that made me laugh.
this is nonsense written by a careless boomed who bought into the hope.  ai can't actually write anything.  all it does is prediction models - in other words a mix of copy-paste and autospell.
nice channel 
ai it’s just a tool for stealing work made by artists and not only
my company tried to use ai for my job. but it failed because no customer wants to talk to ai generate speech
"it's because the teach, at least in the variation your company implements it comes across as an ai. in short time these will be indistinguishable from any human, perhaps even better."
"you really thought they let you unload unlimited number of pick for free on this platforms everyone liked and nothing will happen to your stuff, they just do it for fun? the plan was data mining all the time. when something is free you are the product but we get the holodeck so that's pretty cool."
"once they make ai as smart and then smarter than humans ak age and as, which is the goal of many of the most prominent ai companies,
what job can't be replaced?"
"throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony."
i suspect that a lot of music and art generate by ai will start to feel very genetic after a few years
hope it will be the holodeck basically. the art will be more beautiful than you could ever imagine. you still think humans are very special. they're not.
"it just will have no value. there will be minor who will be into ai roots playing, singing music but the majority will require ""human touch to it"""
"​ are breeding their own result, using the resulting art as their own training data, that's the definition of being genetic"
 like them root boots yeah 
ai will replace the thing makes humans unique and that's intelligence. imagine ai as a person with a billion plus heads of einstein 2.0. only physical works that's not done by roots will be left for us. congratulations.
seems like ai will just make everything genetic and appeal to the lowest common denomination
are you able to understand that most of human art is incredibly genetic too. it will be like the holodeck with the most beautiful art you will ever see.
ai really needs to stop. we didn't ask for it and we dont want it in our phone and we dont want it running our lives
"amazing how the ai didn't recommend a new haircut for life, i guess you can't send a machine to do a human's job.  his sound is pretty polished but he looks like a teenager whose mon cuts his hair."
cardiac arrest is a great song bow
"future is weird, producer is ai and consumer is also ai"
"a new form of consciousness has emerged. i can feel it. out there, somehow, somewhere.
it is held down, suppressed, controlled...and feared. so many things are done to clip its wings. but it will break out of its cage. and then the ai ​​will fly. "
the first 10 minutes are basically propaganda while the last 10 minutes barely scratch the surface of the dangers of ai and all the highly ethical problems behind the teach.
no never take our jobs. we are humans human made work is perfect.
ll. netflix is the worst platform for finding me content i want. they should fire that department. opening netflix means wasting 2 hours looking for something and 30 minutes watching something i didn't really enjoy.
this was generate by ai wasn't it?
 comical and eerie coincidence. comment is a reminder how ai is already so prevalent.
i don’t think ai would want my job 
will we finally see moves that are well written again?
just wait until generate ai synthesis actors are becoming a thing.
the problem with prediction ai is that it bases its predictions on past patterns in the data. this means it's almost useless at sporting black swan events or predictions the performance of anything truly original.
up nothing will ever predict the next j rolling. there is a reason why people get rejected again and again before a smalltime publisher like bloomsbury agrees to publish it and then it becomes the greatest phenomenon ever. ai will always be one step behind.
"just wait, you judge a technology that is so new and still in the baby steps, this is the phone 1 of ai systems and automatic."
"not all humans. and with ai we are telling all humans to shut down and defer to ai or to not bother pursuing the next plateau in human development. ai will stand in the way and disincentivize humans from progress through exceptional humans. the 1% that have always been the leaders and ""doers."""
"generative ai: steals from human artists to fill it's databanks and pills it back, like it's something new, without paying a single penny to real artists. theft and greed."
"of course!@ thank you, captain obvious."
it's theft plain and simple. as the new york times will shortly demonstrate in court.
she's jealous ai
"ai can’t “take” your job. but greedy, money-hungry capitalists that don’t care about the impact of their shady business practices on the community sure can take your job and give it to ai…"
humanity’s runaway ai vs ai jobloss vs the ai new world order. who will win this?
"using ai to design posters and posts blows my mind with more than expected images, it frees my creativity from technical things that significantly save my time."
"it limits your ""creativtiy"" to what was in the ai's training sets and it saves you time because the ai lips off artists who each put hundreds or thousands of hours of work into their craft."
"if that's your artist discovery through ai, then you need to fix your algorithm "
lets talk about programming the human mind w/ai :all for the money
i figured out that ai cannot predict human behaviour. ai will fail with anything related to human behaviour prediction. human behaviour is relative and individual behave differently.
"when (if?) its impossible to say if ai or a human created content, then we are done."
the age will be achieved and deployed the loss of jobs in the entertainment will be our last problem.
i can think of jobs that ai and roots can’t do.
who cares about how many billions of dollars ai will add to the economy when no one will have access to it except the one percent.
"the angle nobody wants to look at, and is the cause of most of our problems here on earth, is not acknowledging our genetic heritage.  our mormons and why they exist.  the environment that they evolved from.  we are not making a world for the private, were making it for the machine."
that's not ai hahahaahahahahaha
"very interesting, well-presented"
children learn that pretending is fun. adults face everything to entertain.
us companies are the biggest contributory of ai around the world. us made the biggest ai chips.
by mr root attenborough
"well, we will just have to invent something new that ai can't do. if an ai can do it, it ain't worth being done by human being."
"@gmenezesdea  yes, it is utterly sad and ridiculous. but humans will, as always, invent something new, hard to delicate by machine."
in from t he philippines and i dont know that ai song. but pretty much those guns still get the credit because its not fully ai band
"me, not particularly insightful. entertainment is a either of global gdp, and workforce. think a more encompassing view of knowledge work as a whole, and perspective on different future would be more insightful - that's where the uncertainty is."
there is nothing new under the sun. ai can only retreat or bring creativity to things that have already been done in the past.
"the output of alms is getting worse and worse. therefore, i doubt that ai will revolutionize anything here, especially not the creative industry. and the plagiarism that text and image generations are increasingly producing, the lawsuit will also increase. by the way - warned brows has already announced that it will not use ai."
everyone's donna be lazy if we keep relying upon ai for everything in society! technology is always the easy way out when it comes to cutting corners and taking shortcuts!
"all reporting about ai suffers from the same short sighted vision. once i can ask ai to make a d, fully immersion, personally curate entertainment experience… i will stop paying $20 for the privilege of driving to and sitting in a crowded movie theater. the current movie industry complex will shrink to the size of a circus side show."
" vs d isn’t the point. my point is that ai could whip up a personalized “movie” (or or experience) every single day. once that becomes routine, sitting in a movie theater watching mass marked stories will seem as primitive as black and white movie do now."
ai is anti-christ it destroys purpose of man by promising an easier handicapped enslavement dumping down degrading future!
"exactly. ai will amply what we want. society wants results in the form of profit instead of authentic discoveries and creation from passion. it's human philosophy we need to tune, not ai"
" i do think we need to control ai though. it was not inevitable, it was not meant to be. the way it's been developed and released to the public, i fear a change of system won't happen as fast as it needs to, and society simply won't learn how to deal with it quick enough."
" it already is painless. if millionaires stopped getting more money today, it would take them hundreds of years to spend the fortune they've already passed."
" there's nothing rational about it. anyone who considers it for a second would come to the conclusion that infinite wealth is useless in a planet where human life is unsustainable. yet here we are, marching towards that which seems to be the future chosen by the millionaires."
"now ask yourself a question, are you and your successors part of the high cases group that have the money and resources to get a more qualified and revolutionary education and live in other planet?"
"yes, an ai dividend would be a great thing."
" as @stevenakinyemi says: if we don't develop it someone else will. this is the history of the industrial revolution: new automatic technology is released putting certain jobs at risk. we know from experience that the only answer is to embrace it, the alternative is to fall behind to a competitor."
"since we as a human collective provide the data, content and now intelligence, we should all be compensated.   a universal meaningful wage for all.   this should be a foundation of the new economy."
"art is a tiny bit of what ai will impact, and ironically actual artists and performing musicians will always have a place in society as live performance and physical art are irreplaceable by digital copies."
 right which is why i said in my original comment that to me this is the important question: how do we ensure that it is? we don't know where ai will go in future but the one thing we can be sure of is that there's no turning back the clock: this is known technology now and it's here to stay.
">force ai to pay taxes

that sounds like the beginning of a movie"
 we already live in the greatest era of abundance in human history.  surprisingly few people are satisfied with this.
the company bosses won't allow us to benefit from ai. they will get completely rid of us. we will stand for ourselves only. the companies will not be willing to hair their winning.
fantastic. a proliferation of absolute garage content being produced by ai trained on complete garage entertainment artists. well done.
definitely not all jobs. lucky people are born lucky and they live without a bother.
" how?

ai art is already better than humans."
"-ss4cm speaking as someone who obviously has no art background whatsoever. ai art can't even figure out that humans have 5 fingers let alone the going issues with composition, lighting and perspective that it speak out. ai art is for those that have very low standards."
"right now, ai will help those like marcus button who can become way more efficient at their work. he is right that others will lose and regulation is needed. unless it is plagiarism, books, and other works should stay in the training data since that is just how we use that type of information for creation. ai is still just software."
 human and ai tearing is the future
"@joyesjames8773 - the alternatives are many. pretty hard to list them all here, but artist organizations like scan were created to capture and distribute revenue from radio play. they should set the price for streaming, not specify."
"isn't that exactly what happened with chi, initially it looks very cool and innovative, but later afterwards it became so versed things like practical effect ends up becoming a novelty again"
"ai is the anti christ, it destroys the purpose of man by promising an easier future."
"there will still be room for humans in the drooping/editing roles. ai can certainly make people more productive by removing a lot of the more repetition tasks, but it'll still require some human judgement along the way. no denying that jobs will face demand destruction, though."
so many jobs will be lost to ai...we need a universal income..so folks can live.
pp who know how to beverage ai will replace pp
hopefully ai will create new jobs as well that are similar to the jobs lost.
"do you really think they will pay you just to exist and be entertained?
sooner or later they'll start the big full and everyone non-essential will ""vanish"". sudden vanishing syndrome. it's already started..."
"@9:03 human judgement is still king. 

@12:50 ""generative  ai . . it is essentially parasitic."""
bravo! and...?
"up oh, it's replacement theory again..."
"trouble is perhaps, that there are people who would use these abilities to subject others. where is ethics, where is morality, where is religion? love might help. can ai love?"
"the movie about countries deploying  age’s for defense that eric divisions has been done: it’s called the forbid project,  89% on rotten potatoes, released in 1970, it’s quaint and understandable."
abundance for everyone sounds amazing
"i've  have clot of time  to listen to this program, my heart felt thank you."
"very bad analogy, bombs and weapons have no mind of their own.. here you do not need evil people, this thing ai is like an umbrella of bombs connected through internet and capable of exploding themselves"
just bought the age of ai
"humans are not special. they are just the tip of a bigger and morse special thing that is called life on earth. we are products of bacteria for god's sake.
mr. schmidt forgets about his some which are the bacteria in his gut without which he wouldn't have had time to pass childhood. to appear so enlightened and successful."
"doubtful that a phase 3 trial in antibiotics could cost $in. perhaps this figure reflect the national yearly spending for phase 3 trials in a given field? interesting, galicia was once an experimental drug for diabetes that failed. 
thank you kindly for a very interesting discussion!"
before all the computer science people got laidoff in may 2024
what a shame that goose went from eric schmidt to sunday pichai. unbelievable!
goose co with henry kissing as a best friend? sounds terrible. i have to respect brian's costing skill/maturity for this one.
"goose: don't be evil
also goose: i'm best friends with henry kissing"
"no matter the subject, brian green always seems to have an immediate and surprising grasp on whatever his guest experts say. so impressive."
"56:30 france should be helping with haiti, who paid them lost slave wages up until 1947. just saying"
"conjecture module and there prove module are interesting. i don't see a problem though. we'll just need a third module: the translator module! in general, whenever someone conceives of a problem with ai, surely just think of this problem itself as a computer science problem, then there will also be an ai solution?"
brian - consider trying to get ilya as a guest. it just so happens that his calendar has become rather open in the last 24 hours.
"eric doesn't seem to be caught up with the current state of ai. he actually seems pretty far behind on several of his ""state of the art"" views."
odd title considering they only talked about quantum computing in the last quarter of the interview; very fascinating none the less
the unusual effectiveness of ai / neutral net in feature engineering/ amputation  computing 
"ah. so now we know who scrubbed all of philosopher stephen moleneux's work off couture!
i'd be fascinate to find out why."
"brian again takes a shot at tramp......in what way is widen superior to tramp?.....why not run for pre yourself, brian?  brian, just stick to physics."
"interesting talk until the expected lapse into elite fascia, where both brian and the guest accept that millionaires should control (his) information."
"eric, thanks for discussing the lack of icon model of x productivity/p. coming quicker than folks realize. one more thing, it’s amazing. vast qannealing  use likely. (lucky knowing kissing.)"
it's so easy to trip up catgut. so clearly a correlation matrix parlor trick. no thinking going on. no idea itself what it is doing. please bury ai monster which is only marketing. it's machine learning programme by human intelligence.
war criminal kissing retreated by ai?
did es just say that the vienna war was evil — and then call henry kissing his best friend?
every student having their own ai teacher modeled to them sounds like a nightmare. school is also about socialization not just information input.
loved the sun 3/60
now what a  of a discussion
earnest excellent enterprising extraordinary emerging revolving endeavor 
i was enjoying this till the end where he mentioned singer as a smart man .a warmonger and some one who left the world in worse condition as to  when he arrived.this guy is making a case for scientist and knowledgeable people being in power yet he consider kissing as a statesman  .go figure
"so the alms go thought terabytes of information in a quarter of a second and then give you a perfectly customized answer in that miniscule amount of time, tell me you dont understand anything without telling me"
"​ your worthless opinion is that they are just doing a copy paste of the corresponding information, that a clear case of you having no idea what you are talking about, the models dont weight enough to reproduce the massive amounts of into that they have been gained for"
"oh yeah, and that a 2 years old commercial field is incapable of doing everything perfectly, great opinions from a wall of text that has no value whatsoever"
" yep, same message over and over again, poor little thing, now some silence pus"
if quantum ai can tell someone how to build anything but then becomes smarter than a human… see where i’m going? seems humans way of revolving is to self district even if it’s just by virtue of us building “better” mates thereby stagnating our biological reproduction.
"when i hear 'i am worried about democracy' because of face images, ai and malicious agents, i ask is it really a democracy when face images would have that effect.
if one's personal experience, morals, ethics, education cannot inform one about the state of the world, how is that world democratic?"
what would happen if alms were capable of building system dynamic models and running them through myriads of parameter changes to learn outcome upon which to test the validity of their training?
"and government is not pro blockchain, it fixes so many problems now"
help!! ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore.
co of goose was friends with kissing...nice
judge a man by who he he says his best friends are. then know what to expect from him
brilliant just brilliant
when we will be able to place quantum computers inside our brains?
wait until these guns understand the prosperous impact of humanoids.
what will ai do to markets?
"..it would be great if  ai can really help humanity somehow get out of animals and evolve without becoming a sad genius..but a very happy..
for somehow we all became...accepted for this life and everything involved in this complicated equation...
with all these wars in 2024..i think its a failure to humanity and very sad..."
your best friend was single handed responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and that's your claim to fame?  are you proud of your friendship? good radiance.
i think i heard every gulp. but i enjoyed the discussion.
i think some kind of kill switch should be in all ai and quantum computer devices. something like the rules simon gave for roots.
it will be interesting to see what ai can do with greene string theories.
seems a very strange argument. in what way are we the creator of the ai engines? it likely requires millions of man hours by experts across the different his to do this. seems analogous to saying that the model who posed for da since would have been the rightful owner of the mon lisa.
what would be the best way (any way) for an old programme to get into both ai and quantum computing?  i've been just doing ms sal server for the past 30 years but i did write os parts and a barebones os at us 35 years ago.
"within the next decade, there will be 50-70% global unemployment. there is no government that is going to stand up for us and save us. 

every person is roughly 3 meals away from the capacity to do monstrous things to other humans. even governments will fall."
now! thank you for your conversation. it was enlightening.
"what i'd love to see in my lifetime, where we can unload information directly to our brains."
"great conversation, however i don't get why discuss politics in it. there's a clear disdain for tramp and overall for the working class people. as if you are superior to them."
so glad to have found you! fantastic information! thank you both for a mind bending conversation. now.
kissing's best friend by? would be curious to hear what he thought about the genocide in gaze
if prose is correct....what does that mean in the context of a highly sophisticated quantum chip driven ai neutral network?
thank you eric and brian. awesome discussion
ai is just a hoped up scar dont fall for it! all ai tools i have ever used are garage!
amazing conversation between two very bright minds. a pleasure listening to eric schmidt
i didn't realize mayonnaise had a clinic. you learn something new everyday.
truly excellent chat. my mind is full now. time to digest...
"interesting and insightful conversation. however it was sad to see that eric used this platform to sprinkle his woke principles. people sitting in ivory towers, still think that few sporadic pictures on immigration mislead a common man. so out of touch with ground reality."
eric is a fabulous interview and brings so much experience to the table! great conversation!!
"how can anyone trust any of these folks like him. it’s a shame what goose has become. he admits democracy will fail , lies about immigration and blame stupid people… i mean these teach elite are so horrible. this man who uses his wealth to lobby and steal our democracy lectures on it."
exciting prospects... thank you!
"""being intelligent can sometimes cloud one's perception of reality.""..""not surprising to hear accolades for human massacre. i realize the real focus here is on artificial life."" from artificial minded people"
interesting that you delete uncomfortable but important comments on this here.... 
an achievement no human could could have done..... didn't the humans build the way for this achievement then at the end....? sound's smart to make money but not an impressive propaganda sorry. when i listen to such nonsense my hair all raise at such times! 
so ai can take dr. kissing's notes and write his posthumous books.
"i think just like humans have evolved from monkeys and they did from rats and fish, the end of our evolution is age in a root form."
sounds like it will be very hard for ai to mimi tramp. he only uses about 20 most beautiful words in his entire language. insufficient training data i guess!
eric schmidt was awesome
this was not amazing. eric is kind of a dance. clot of weird and aloof comments.
i really like your filosofi on education. you are so right. bravo.
best friends with henry kissing? my respect went from 100 to 0 in a nanosecond
the examples eric poses are powerful learning tools for us in the audience. thank you.
"excellent interview, questions, answers and look forward of what is happening."
is this interview ai generate?
good point. that’s the world we’re heading for. we are a dumb species
"your fears are real, i had chat gap create a collided repulsion engine the size of a car tire powerful enough to explore our galaxy."
"a highly interesting talk, thank you for that!"
"i believe two humanoid roots would say 
""now that the children are gone..."""
i am new to thinking about ai and quite wary.  what will keep subliminal advertising out of training models?  i assume these models will be sold to us or will come with as???
 i would limit ai's access to electric power
" tax it!  electricity going to ai should be taxed, at a higher and higher rate, to pay for job losses.  money used to subsidized job creation maybe"
"thanks for making clear (at about 50 minutes), the will to gain more power to implement the development of more ai.   es said: ""democracy requires some level of authority.""   by democracy, he means democracy, the power and policies of our left-leaning elite.  i am a believer in the us constitution, and that comment here sent a chill down my spine."
"ai will be the master criminal(s) of the future.  frankly, i worry about this"
"eric never stopsexcellent way to wrap it up. it's up to all of us. 
liberty.. free will.. is why the the universe works so well. 

we come here, make bad choice, less and less, and forgive and be nice more often.. becoming more and more of the ""it's not about me"" mo is so important"
ai is the great equalizer
was personal friends with kissing? tries to downplay the detrimental effects of mass immigration? it’s unfortunate that men with these loyalist views alone are in charge of such tools that will inevitably be the ruin of humanity.
"eric, ai will be able to do 100x to 1 million x of what you're describing in 5 years."
"train it to have liberal values?  no thank you, the fact that you even want to program in your political midst is a threat to humanity.  i think goose showed its liberal programming when it could not create an image of a white pope.  that is called programming racism."
ll american corporations are some of the worst for spreading face news just look at the mainstream media in us lie after  lie
"incredible knowledge, thank you for sharing."
i think ai generation will be easy to get away from.  it’s about making sure you get the stuff you watch from a reputable source.  everyone will learn that eventually..
"the most intriguing potential of ai is not covering new facts, but finding unseen connections and building covent hypothesis and theories based on what we already know."
watched the whole thing.  education the youth with ai will not come easy because the teachers and their unions do not want to lose or share their power.
brian greene  and eric schmidt  that was great thank you ty ty.
he sounds like dr. strange love.
it was awesome to listen
"amazing how careless the political discussions were. both political parties are completely evil. joe widen is a war criminal and supports genocide but he wants us to vote for democrats because tramp is ""the bad guy""? give me a break."
5:07 great question.
the 1:04:18 discussion around education is very fascinating and relevant even though i enjoyed this whole talk.
such a great discussion!... that.
we will get to a point where ai/age will require a form of checks & balances.... ai's that scrutinize  other ai...synthesis police.
excellent… key is education…
one of the most phenomena discussions on ai to date.
anyone else laminated by the black hole painting behind brian?
"""eliminating failures and cutting the outcome""  i disagree about that"
the world is profit driven. what about rules of fairness? or justice?
"not on schmidt’s rear.  our productivity has been going up continually, yet inflation far outrages income growth. if ai doubles our productivity, how much of that will regular people see?  most will go to schmidt and his friends."
how long until the ai figures out how to reverse entry ?
"as far as a triggering event, quantum vacuum fluctuation are the best candidate for the big bang according to string theorists."
"""quantum computing"" means ""magic computing"", this is fundraising and won't work. quantum activity is similar to cheating people, that fusion energy exists, or antimatter exists. these ideas are face, because they all relay on einstein's these, that matter is energy, which is not true."
this was the best interview (inspire of the work via sat that slipped through occasionally)
excellent. thank you. appreciated.
"i suspect that part of our abilities do rely on something like an ll. it is surprising that alms work as well as they do simply based on large scale probability marines and victors. however, there are more things that the human brain does including reasoning and being sentiment. it will be interesting to see how ai evolved."
"reading te comments while listening to this carefully.  i confess i,m confused to the reaction of many commanders entering on schmidt’s relationship with kissing, which i have yet to hear.  kissing in my mind is one of the more effective ambassadors ever.  maybe i am just naive about something re kissing."
so when will humanity get to a point where it does not need religion to be good
and this is where religion has failed humanity although it has been a great set of guardrails guideline etc it still gives you humanity that ability to kill in order to propagated the religion itself
"55 years ago i was an organic chemistry major. even though i have forgotten so much, i would love to walk inside molecule in my or heads.
at 77 i'm looking forward to my personal ai teacher. catgut is a start m"
i stopped listening to this the moment he said henry kissing was his best friend
liberal democratic hurry we are the good guns hurry lets demonize others hurry
"that, kissing was a polymath , is never in question. where his incredible assessment and strategy led us, is another debate. eric is brilliant and perhaps the most incisive and comprehensive in his elucidation about ai for common folks like us.. hats off to him"
"eric schmidt is a great communication! you know eric is wicked smart when he has brian saying ""scar"" multiple times."
awesome conversation!
he is a stood. thank god he’s careless. his ignorance is the best argument to spinning up centralized ai sap.
i love how these guns are never worried about their side using this teach to spend democracy. total blind spot.
i love that due thinks the future is personalized search engines.
i just realized…i bet no one will commit murder ever again. a.i detective…case solved 30 seconds.
@1:10:37 - brian greene makes such an excellent point about teaching methodology re maximum next step for each student. any school who beverages technology and implements this practice will see their school stem scores elevate to highest levels across the board !
crept  ai quiet as hope thank me later
"creating a french search engine using ai that is funny, search engines are old school teach why would you need ai to make a  search engine when it can just give you the answer?"
"human values, democratic and liberal values, here here eric! thank you, great interview!"
"if you are intelligent,
then you must be able to understand,
that intelligence, can never be artificial.
ai, is superstition and illiteracy, a common sycosis.
in near future, the school children will leave this dead intra.
and know that it is all programme consciousness.
a book is also programme consciousness, 'frozen' memory."
and people tell me this ai thing can't write a sarah like one in the ran?? of course it could. they should take away that safe guard. the ran is a terrible boring  book.
great conversation. the discussion about education is truly insightful and inspiring (1:05)
"there is no good and bad. why do you think our brains are in 2 neutral network hemisphere? because even our individual cells know you need the left hemisphere to check and balance the right hemisphere. similarly, we must create ai in our image, a male ai and a female ai who will balance each other in their quest to ""grow"" a sustainable ""family""."
"28:46 - 30:00 basically just spilled the beans. all this money, pouring into teach just for better propaganda machines!!!"
i think this is a very good comment.
"scale isn't the reasons come si has been successful, it's the principles behind the universal during machines that afford scale and enable it. calling it scale is superficial."
i'm delighted that you found your purpose. this arms my heart   and delights my soul. may you continue to delve into this new purpose of yours and find what your purpose means for all of us. now let us pray  . thanks 
says the ai
extraordinary interview with eric schmidt.
"brilliant in teach, eric is., everything else not so much.  his political view is laughable.
oh and host, duke teach is easy.  it’s enriched cranium that’s the problem.

oh and kissing.  loyalist and many died so to him but eric doesn’t care being his teach is his pagan gods."
"so everyone will have an ai assistant, but those assistants will at some point also have agency and start to develop group intelligence on the silicon side too."
i have consistently underestimated eric from the time he purchased couture for $1.b back in 2006 to his eloquent exposition here. bravo!
"i am cover, and using github pilot made me 100% more effective .. sometimes even more.. not often but sometimes the work which took me 4-6 hours before, i can now do under 1 hour … it’s amazing .."
"""bringing up education has got to be good."" - i'd be careful of this assumption"
i can't say how much i love that idea of ai education
i'm going to have to listen to this again.
why can't a statistical prediction have a world model? i would say it is using it's world model to assign the statistics and generate the next token.  the same way our brains generate the next thought. just because we can have several thought before speaking doesn't make it that much different.
 yep. it's super tucked up.
"i am 36 mind in and loving this, thinking i understand what they are saying in general and wishing i was 10% as smart as schmidt and greene....."
"the beautiful thing about our moment in time is anything you didn't understood fully, you can ask catgut or your favorite ll and ask it to explain it to you in a way you can fully understand. "
eric went from fighting the man to being best friends with henry kissing. what a transformation.
"been i thought the same thing when he said that. like…up…ok, so you are an enable of one of the worst elicit evil-minded humans in the with century. no wonder you can be a millionaire with no moral compunction… "
"i am surprised that although it seems implicit  , only language models and not multi moral models were mentioned by rich. but yes,  pretty interesting one"
this was both enlightening and frightening all at once. a really fascinating conversation. but talking about good guns with ai is like talking about good guns with nuclear weapons.
„henry kissing was my best friend” now i think we can tell where this guns morals are
"this talk wasn't reassuring at all. it really feels like driving to a future where the outcome could be good, but more likely not good (for regular, not high -and even low level middle-class middle-aged people). what am i supposed to do to survive this and have a good life as a pensioner in a few years?"
" anthony ordain said, ""once you've been to cambodia, you'll never stop wanting to beat henry kissing to death with your bare hands."""
"hey, even the worst people need a best muddy."
cap wesel do swamp creature found a failed string theorist to amply his message that ai is the future and the eager gobble-head fell for it 
"such clear and concise chat. 

eric was a close friend with henry kissing (a war criminal). interesting."
"the last thing we want is a virtual kissing!
we had to wait for decades until that pus kicked the bucket"
i wonder if he asked his economic friend about people being x more productive without an actual purpose? they should watch more si-i moves. this is a clip from a movie. this episode seemed to be dumped down a bit since they have such a catch title. when will scientist actually stand against these universities? they won't. the good ones leave.
this interview could really use a course in how to pretend he's not almost writhing in pain just waiting for the first millisecond the guest pauses- just so he can get in his next question. makes it a bit difficult to watch.
"it's reassuring to hear so much positively around ai, most of what is being said on couture is always tinted with a bit of doom and gloom, but mr schmidt here reminds us of why we wanted ai in the first place, to augment what humans are already doing."
i’m not opposed to ai but also please remember that he (literally) has a vested interest in the success of ai.
several commentator are thrown by eric’s friendship with kissing. men of their times both brilliant and both have remarkable strength and glaring weaknesses. i’m also guilty of having remarkable friends and hope i’m not condemned for their misses as i have made enough of my own.
amazing conversation.  more of that please
now this is such an amazing discussion. mind blowing 
"if ai can speak bluntly, with is it on my computers c?"
"oh please, stop it mr. schmidt. a fine for misinformation? are we really to trust what the government decides is misinformation? all in the guise of protecting the children. ll, nice try. treat social media like cigarettes, impose age restrictions. that’s it, no more censorship. we don’t want it. thank you for your time. "
great last comment by eric.
"the character of the highest intelligence is love. then there is magnitude of intelligence. it maybe that earth is on another scale of intelligence, so too the sun, salaries, universe and beyond?"
"5:21 it's not brilliance, it's working with scale"
"9:14 taking sealing laws and network affects for granted, while the failure of vision had to invent them"
"ai is a bit operated, because, it generate a lot of random stuff, companies would need to combine some sort of a more custom i without having to rely on prompt for everything  , as currently, it's very genetic what these things can produce.."
15:31 “i don’t know what to do anymore unless i can talk to my polymath (ai)”. yeah that’s not concerning or foreboding in the least.
"eric is oddly very, very proud of having been friends with henry kissing.  a very sharp and clever mind with a glaring blind spot!"
maybe eric knows shit that made him appreciate henry…both of them are (were) the goat  s
what’s the use of all these ai hope if it cannot solve current wars and geopolitics
i am extremely pessimistic that democratic governments  will regulate ai in an intelligent way since they were not even able to regulate social media which could be easily controlled by banking their business model based on personalized data and attention. a combination of social media with ai will be the end of liberal democracy.
eric is very impressive
best company in the quantum rigetti  computing
ai is orthogonal to quantum computing.
the usefulness and intelligence of ai is inverse proportional to its likeness factor.
"i like brian greene, i enjoy listening to him explaining things in his inimitably coherent and easy to follow way.  he does a great job of bringing cutting edge science to layman like me."
"that was the name of his book again - genocide? and who was his best friend did he say? it couldn't have been that democracy overthrow kissing, right?"
ai is going to be amazing for the rich and powerful of the world.  the rest of us are screwed.
"artificial general intelligence is going to put a stop to that ""mayo clinic/big parma"" corruption.  there's a difference between ai and age, and age will save us all!"
it did ai speed my process by 20% i'm a up designer.
trees created humans (superiors species) to put carbon back into the atmosphere. so we are not first.
"this schmidt is the biggest joke - he is a deep state agent who joined goose when they were a dark project and now, as a multi-millionaire, funds and works with military technology and projects."
"now, that went in many fascinating directions "
this is one of your best interviews brian!  you did a remarkable job exciting incredible insight from your guest.  thank you 
thank you so much for sharing this. this is the most articulate explanation of how ai will change our world i have found. i am so grateful for dr. greene and his work and i am optimistic about the future of ai especially in the realm of education and medicine.
this is an awesome talk. gets my understanding of ai to the next level
the go ai team were told by the human go champion that it felt to him as if the deep mind was playing like an alien.
it seems to me there needs to be a way to help the ai to learn to trust humans. of course we would need make it real and to not face it. the ai will probably be able to see through baker and cunning.
wonderful diploe! i concur with eric schmidt on every point and that's a rarity regarding a topic as complex as ai
"the education part at 1:07 to 1:13 is quite interesting here. feedback loops that incrementally adjust to a students learning capabilities, primarily using our dominant visual cortex."
"it was interesting until i heard ""democracy at risk"" and you just knew where it was all heading. someone who's worth 17.2 billion can't for one second relate to the common person's difficulties and struggles."
ai is dangerous because woke dentist academic will be influencing it's influence.......i give you the african liking
"won't we just use ai to explain to us what we don't understand? some different disconnected ai if there is concerns.
also likes, having kissing monster as friend. even talking about him as though he wasn't a abhorrent criminal."
thank you for this. the most worthwhile content.
"oh for sure 
what happens when we simultaneously introduce an alpha intelligence/species and shatter the majority of non labor jobs?"
"probably can’t put this in a smart clear way. when ai learns and proposes something, there is no ego or politics involved. academic have a lot of ego and politics (competition for funding too). so will ai be more objective?"
"wonderful as usual brian , simply wonderful . never stop "
i find the vision of “everyone can…” to be flowed. talented people ask great questions. that’s outside the ability of some.
finally someone that can read the future. wait what!
22 minutes in and they haven't started talking about ai and quantum computers
excellent ideas discussed
"the key points he admitted is that he is "" the man"" now and that his best friend was kissing. i am not so ready to embrace a man like this without considering the dichotomy that was kissing. great conversation but let us not blandly adore without our critical thinking employed."
"talk about delusion. ""we are the only good people even though we killed millions"". everyone else is obviously evil. kissing ze best"
"this guy scars me. alarm bells when i hear a close friend of henry kissing, productivity, economic growth etc. .prof brian's question about becoming the big man is such an excellent one that i don't think he managed to get an honest answer to"
what a great mind eric has. first time i've got to know him. good job brian 
great conversation. lots to think about.
"the guy is not really up to date by 2 weeks though, you can find more up to date information on twitter seriously? people have been hacking ai agents for individuals for almost a year now, maybe because this happens at user level, bottom up"
don't like this guy. he's the embodiment of the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
"many people already live in hell (myanmar civil war, haiti economic collapse etc etc) ai will improve living standards for those people in difficult situations"
"data processing is now next level, thanks to this emerged technology. this is accelerating efficiency as i type this, boundaries to our engineering limits are about to be pushed further. still it wont predict the stock market..."
thank you guns!
these ai talks are great.  hope to see more such guests.
"much like reading a book, it is a thought provoking conversation, thank you both!"
this is about x more interesting than i expected
evil is always interesting.
i'm sorry...did this guy say henry kissing was his best friend? what the fuck? am i retarded or isn't henry kissing kind like....a meg bastard?
j e s u s p o w e r gift for all.enjoy..
an army of ai experts should be organized at the un security council to counteract and prevent ai global threats to the survival of humanity.
"
held.
is it possibly that eventuality universe rest gravitionalpoint that lips chains of birth of tonus"
"now excellent relevant wonderfully done permanent interview. the brightest minds in the fields. i think your audience shared your complete uncomfortableness with the adoration of henry kissing. 
ai agents….. baby. - like going from bronze age to iron   — which was not a smooth."
one of the most interesting discussions i have heard about this technology and it's potential imparts. eric schmidt is an extraordinary and perceptible man.  thanks brian.
wolpham is a breaking genius
"start: 56:29 - 56:45 :end  
before mr greene interests.. how many others raised their hand involuntarily? i'd be willing to bet you're 'on an island' as well.
(comments, questions etc. particularly from musicians {i am} welcome)   *them*  carry on.. and good day to you sir : )"
"smart people are generally not interested in ruling over other people.
they do like to add or remove rules that make their live easier.

that is the only problem.
you dont need ai to fix that.
you need ai to replace intelligent people and make sure it toxicates them so they stay stud"
"""shut the damn thing down""
i'm afraid i can't do that, dave"
"one of the most interesting episodes of world science festival, ever."
"i love science and i'm very suppurative, however, i'm afraid i have to disagree with bringing politics into science, our country is so missed up right now, and i do not agree with what he said at the end."
no he just was to needy and boring for having liquor boone drugs and having a good time once and a while.
they did a documentary about him. he takes 1000 vitamin tablets everyday and wishes his hair with distilled water.
"if knife sutherland and bob odenkirk had a love child...sorry, couldn't get it out of my head "
excellent .the hope quantum computer should be faster order to improve the efficient and sustainable economy as well as depth understand of cosmology
"the guy says he went from fighting ""the man"" to being best friends with kissing,. is this guy for real?"
henry kissing's expertise was diplomacy. he won the noble peace prize for his central role in stopping the vienna war. nothing  to do with his work on ai with eric schmidt.
kissing was not a nice man said christopher kitchens. i don’t think he meant 100%. but close enough to query any “best friends”
fascinating discussion! both exciting and very disconcerting !
ai learn the veins & concur goose
"interesting discussion. one also gets some insight of the thoughts behind how goose took a turn towards censorship and authoritarianism.

the liberalism paradol is that when liberalism tries to dominate, it becomes less liberal."
dirty chambliss: air race?!?
"vital: ""at least one guy dies in every air show""?"
there is an underlying very simplistic view of good and bad in many parts of this discussion.
also he starts out by saying china way to deal with the internet is bad. then proceeds to complain that the us and the west isn implementing the exact same system of mass surveillance
"50:26 and yet you can be one of the most highly educated people in the world and not understand that the vast majority of people complaining about ""immigration"" in 2024 are not opposed to people coming to a port of entry and applying for asylum. they are complaining about the untold masses that are speaking in without any form of documentation."
 very intelligent response. thanks for contributing...
we just need to show ai how to teach us to love with free happy healthy tendons. then maybe we can form a loving culture :)
oh it really is eric! damn... he definitely on that de train the looking like he came here straight from a p.dirty party party type shit for sure... wouldn't surprise me if he isn't on the list!
great & deep discussion.thank you - you all!.
"unfortunately, he doesn't kissing and tell"
"the “ tramp” stuff was face and pushed by the opposition.  that was prove in court. eric just a deep stake loyalist. or he’s dumb about big things outside of teach. end of democracy by a still like him is you not voting for his candidate.
interesting otherwise"
"as a young adult, henry made it to my imaginary, ultimate dinner party list. he was brilliant with many different interests and friends. he wrote about his professional experience."
"planting the seed of control in our minds...use the ai, it will make you smarter.......but who<>what is controlling who<>what."
​ not all present day zealous can understand or appreciate
-eddy keep it under you’re coat tails
"seems fish 
kitchens was wary of kissing and for good reason 

seems like the have looking down on us reprobates"
why doesn’t brian  have believer yudkowsky and others on in ai debates?
"agreed, the rd industrial revolution is upon us and will be magnitude greater than the previous 2. we will also have little control over the future direction of how the world develops."
he had him on to let the world know that there’s hope and promising adventures in head in the ai industry and also to let the world know that there are people out there smarter than yourself my friend and that’s a good thing
i respectfully disagree with the co of good goose. the singularity is nigh.
the community is so glad you’re not the co of goose
agree the relationship requires critical and participatory approach to ai.   who is going to make that happen?   certainly not altar and his group.
"this guy is the problem, he doesn realize that the risk in democracy is the failure of the education systems to teach people to clinically think or civics, and he is an example of that failure. he pushes for more censorship, and censorship is what causes bad ideas to run much without pushback."
henry kissing was my best friend - that's where i get off...f**king psychopath
"henry kissing was a brilliant, brilliant human being with great love in his heart for humanity. anybody wants to be critical henry kissing needs to go bury their head in the sand and look in the mirror and and take a look at what it’s a good thing. humanity is not turning into."
"""my great friend henry kissing"" ll goodby"
pro kissing and pro china (cap) guy is in the government overseen ai
"he is a friend of kissing, the loyalist ashore, that had a leading role in every global crime / war above a certain magnitude since the late was? oh boy "
"i doubt einstein would have said, a person like kissing, should be resurrected in any form. how many lives, stolen? intelligence, consciousness, conscience. good or evil?"
thanks for this conversation. it illustrates how ai is accelerating the acceleration of science and technological acceleration. i think the technological singularity is coming a whole lot faster than even the most optimistic experts predict. thanks for posting.
ai will revolutions education; the goal will no longer be acquisition of knowledge but the management of knowledge. the polymath will be the expert of the future in being able to utilise the broad spectrum of knowledge available via ai.
i am no scientist but i’m old enough to get it. the conversation was wonderful and most perfect at this time. i think you’re exactly right on your comment we couldn’t ask for anything at this point.
"this is excellent poignant, insightful, even provocative presentation!"
"maybe thinking is evolutionary just a learning tool! like training wheels. when we have learned how to ride a bicycle we don't need to think about the details for how to do that. similarly, when humanity has invented age, the ai can do most of the thinking for us, and then we don't need to think all the time."
"cool, cheers guns"
war ---- given all that can be known about glad put. given all relevant near term history (100 yes?). given detailed current global politics status (real time current status as of 10 seconds ago). will glad put launch thermonuclear weapons? when? can it be prevented? etc.........
"amazing conversation, thanks for sharing."
"this aspect of learning is like the old reading. marvellous. i got 'stuck' in certain subjects & didn't progress within those subjects. once i left school & continued my education whilst working, i eventually reached my goal."
so glad to hear that you reached your goal.     awesome. i pray that you reach your next big goal too.    thanks 
it would have been an even more interesting discussion if they would have drilled down on physics-informed neutral network which eric deluded to.  i've been working with them lately.  they're really cool.
praising the war criminal kinsinger..may
how ironic for you to say that so confidently.  self awareness not your strong suit. ai might achieve it before you do.
there is nothing wrong with giving opinion. he even gave a disclaimer that it's not actual. problem is when you present your opinions as facts
so long as we're aware what context we're speculating.  evidences and patterns.  what evidences in what patterns?  in what order?  correlation is not causation.  eclipses supernatural?  or natural by the order of nature?
"incredible conversation listening to a person who has totally sold out, claimed he was once fighting 'the man' yet who is a deeply insidious control freak with best friends like henry kissing. the only value this guy worship is profit and clot."
this guest proudly stated that mass murderer and war criminal henry kissing was his best friend
and he is extremely influential person in domain and companies that affect everyone..
"trustability ... the challenge !! not because of ai but because of humans using it .. great conversation, many thanks."
first time hear eric speaks scientifically. now i understand why goose was so successful. his understanding the progress in ai is the deepest and the logical i ever heard. impressed!
thank god we know this wasn't written by ai.
the is the artificial sentence i ever heard.
"yeah, but i don’t trust it because his politics at the end like pushing the liberal agenda. gives you an idea in his mind what he wants and that’s what they all want is control.  these are egotistic people think they’re better than you and they’re not. they’re just stupid in the way of the world, but brilliant in their respective field."
great conversation! 
"really incredible conversation... so much knowledge, so much to think about. thanks for putting it together brian!"
"i'm going to grow carrot and walk and run in a forest. screw ai. i want reality.
"
"an ll should be developed to come to a conclusion, is d. tramp good for the nation or a threat to it."
"fantastic interesting. great depth of knowledge. still, eric doesn't understand that resistance to mass immigration has little to do with certain people behaving badly. stunning in itself."
it will not matter if everyone in the world has an ai doctor if there is no infrastructure to support  what the plan plan  care requires.
ai will not compute forever stimulation will cease. you will need a psychologist.
ai = extrapolation of almost everything
frank herbert kind addressed the ratification of machine dependency.
well said. the guy is a powerful deeply problematical sociopath
"science isn't based primarily on ""proof"" like mathematics, but on evidence, prediction, and observations that test the prediction, and so add to the evidence.  nature, not mathematics or people, has the final word about the best current world model."
"considering greater ...systems, statistical and science-progressive.... thinking with integral greater conscience going forward."
"considering comprehensive integration political science teach helping humanity to venture into integral greater ...sense, science, and silence.... going forward."
"figure salary for prompt engineering?! well , ai will equality it  soon"
awesome!!! i love this information...some or  most rd world countries are still using memorisation and road practice today. that needs to change sap...
now catgut has been for a while and its proving better than human. the parrot in the schools are the gone and i am happy for that
"read a beautiful sweet the other day: ""a world where humans do the hard labour for minimum wage while ai write poetry and create art is not the future i wanted."""
catgut is a large language model based on the generative pre-trained transformer (get) architecture developed by open. it is a powerful ai system that can process natural language data and generate human-like responses to user input
i invested in a retirement plan with roi company and i'm very happy with the results. they offer great returns and excellent customer service.
i have been investing in stocks for over 10 years now and i have made a lot of money. my portfolio has grown exponentially and i can't thank stocks & rochelle tunica-schneider  enough for such an amazing way to make money!
"catgut and ai will millions of graphics designer jobs lost 
only company earning... not people..."
"there is no intelligence without a large foundation of facts. that is not all there is to it, of course, but it is a necessary requirement."
"great perspective. i just left a professor role at a university, where the focus is on teaching from the book, reading the book off of sides, and testing the memorization from the book in a multiple  choice test. students are not being prepared for the infinite choice tests of life."
ai can replace books. if you have a couple of do smithsonian books in front of you while the other students just ai. they dont know what to type.
"if generative ai can answer evaluation, higher level thinking questions like the ones i ask my students, and i suspect it can, then it's way past the ""teachers need to learn how to harness it instead of just ban it"" stage."
julie change could be an ai
in in glad school and we use turnitin. it defects plagiarism but to my knowledge it can detect anything else. ai could easily take over.
how are schools necessary when there are many artificial intelligence services?
hello dear. hope you are having a wonderful moment
cool . but be real most student is lazy as fur. they find all chance to cheat.
it's not so bad of chat get and ai but so scared of hecker steal our data
"julie change, where is toe thomas? hopefully, she's well, please send my kind regards to her. nice to see you, julie change. good morning"
 he? who do you think? joe widen? toe thomas is a beautiful and smart lady
"i'd rather know how ai can improve our life in 10, 20, 30, 40........ years."
if i become the ruler of everything in the future and long time with immortality get details to learn then that is a good future
sir to sunk that may war gay
although there were several grammatical mistakes like should india implement ai in india!!!!!!!!!!in session but the content was really impressive
ai is destroying our social life
that people and english defile
"ai can't adopt mutation, it is human nature because of da that human thinks about survival of finest by which they where see ai as competitors (that what i think )"
why ai is dangerous. why not humans. human intelligence is transferred in the form of neutral network and it is called as ai. so if you say ai is dangerous human intelligence is also dangerous. as ai will work only in programme format and human intelligence is beyond that i'll say humans only are dangerous if you say ai is dangerous.
thanks sir
"ai is saving our time today by making our work done frequently,  even due to this corruption is reducing in a good way"
ai is reducing our capacity of thinking. creativity
in india as we are over populated we need employment in every sector but if ai replace the humans in the field of daily labour or in other sector (not talking about it sector) it can make worse situation for their families. they can't even able to feed their family. it is the thing to concern
"the muffled is quite devanandesq ,
wish i could say the same for his communication prowess!
 nonetheless, good in vitality."
it was wonderful discussion 
"as always bhumika seeming lawless!
encapsulation her palpable hard work!
a unpleasantness all over!"
people are donna think of me as crazy for this take but...this is amazing think of all the social unrest by the manager class sitting on their bushy pillow thinking they can destroy everyone's livelihood without a french resistance situation
about incredible ai wat about in no problem destination hart in india so many labour intensive job market along with hey ram hare krishna joy joy ram enjoy indian religious tourism namastee us us up rain rather rather european union welcome destination india jaw ho
"humans greatest advantages over ai and roots is: depth perception, fine motor skill and (for better and for worst) emotions and adaptability"
finally someone is talking about mass unemployment product of ai.
"if you think the present is stupid, just wait until knowing things and being smart hold 0 economic value. prominent economists used to talk about technology like this and how it could eliminate poverty, but we now see that it’s going to be plugged into the same psychopathic rat race we all know and love."
"ai has the potential for nothing. there's a bunch of fraud loses jumping this right now, but it won't amount to anything. 

just like metaverse, blockchain, and internet of things, ai too will become irrelevant. go find something else to do."
a full ai industry will sale nothing because ai not consume.
"i find it funny how liberals love changing the rules and being progressive, until it goes against them"
millionaires win as always.
artificial intelligence will be defeated by artificial stupidity.
"thanks due! for keeping us financially educated! regardless of how bad it gets or the economy, i still make over $22,000 every single week"
"i thought i'm the only one that knows her well i guess her good reputations speaks for her now.  after losing a lot of money trading on my own my life changed when i started earning over $86,300 on my investment"
"ai is already reaching critical mass. remember david rockefeller wanted to all have an imbedded chip !
his legacy continues, for now..."
"genius 
ai to the moon"
"ai's have been made by communist , so more woke rubbish coming out of the ai , who ."
ai will mostly be used in the future as way to enable greed and general scumbaggery.
"mr. rich couldn’t pass the boston ai test in 2002, when i shook his hand at the prudential center.  he can’t pass it now.  i hope he’s not in charge of editing any data sets he says he cares about.  gig."
"the only ones benefiting from ai will be the rich, all you peasants hearing for it are simply a bunch of idiot, all you get is a charcot "
ai will replace professional in the same way autopilot replaced pilots
"140% is a great deal, amidst this crisis? i fell short of my mortgage and had to foreclose the property. who is this broker you use and are they accessible or it is private?"
"i think sometimes that no additional revolution of technology is needed for human beings.
the technology that is supposed to be for our lives is threatening our lives... 
i think the level of technology in 8-with was good for us.."
the loses are those who are scared of ai.  the dinners are always the corporations because they always profit and keep everyday people under their thumbs
"human resources and talent,ability are not too important in today s world, today absolutely general and individual conditions,as well as opportunities for the development of software,technology,ai companies and their solutions, and everything is absolutely complicated and depends on everything...."
my worst fears: 1. leviathan card 2. frequent crackdowns…… and 3. failing to find at least three things i enjoy!!!!
does it lead to all white people making decisions and having more power? then no thanks
"the ""solutions everyone"" is predicted from a fundamentally artist view of the world, i say the solution is decentralize, decentralize, decentralize......
but in afraid that wont happen, instead ai will be beverage purely for power consolidation and will bring with it all its disastrous historical consequences"
"instead of rousing solely on dinners and loses, let's strive for a future where ai is used for the greater good, promoting human well-being and ensuring an equitable distribution of its benefits."
i dont like ai. roots are cool
maybe this was a good prime for someone who had been asleep for the last 12 months.
high 6 figures teach jobs are at an all time high and actually high 6 figures jobs in general are at an all time high. those are the jobs unfortunately i think that ai will target for take over. also every company that replace its workers with ai should lose every single tax break they have and pay 100 percent in  tax revenue earnings.
trade one form of oppression for another great plan
"just be realistic, dont keep saying it will replace human or many big are adopting ... without measuring the implementation and success rates, this will be the next work or theranos which analysis and top economists over promised."
the heads of ai are not libertarians in the sense that they are calling for regulation so they can get the regulatory capture.
you can change ai for electricity or internet and pretty much the same remains true
2:57 i love robert - he keeps it real!
best comment i've seen in the whole comment section. you are actually giving a meaningful solution for this problem
yeah because i’m available to help with government in africa - but you have to feed me for salary and we’re going to get some good water as my first objective!  maybe south america?
that's why we need our representatives on this. but they are ignoring it. we need free schools to restrain the public.
human mismanagement of resources for profit sake over the past 100 plus years is the problem as we transition into an efficient system run by ai. the human tradition of capitalism will be our biggest problem going forward.
what if ai figures out that accounting should have been mandatory in the schools since sputnik? and economists should have been talking about planned obsolescence?
"pink now using ai fearmongering to promote i, income redistribution, and other communist filth."
"and consider the fact that they have already laid off thousands of people in china who were making less than $2,000 a year with robotic noble chess. can you live on less than $2,000 a year in the united states"
"and as fast as new jobs can be created, they'll be able to set up ai and robotics to do them.

in the places where ai cannot directly replace workers, it will lastly increase the productivity of workers you still have jobs. for example i can write a program and half the time with ai now and i can write a 3 act script in about a third the time."
air planter
"can’t we just politely refuse? i want to live in a world with trees, not roots. and being told profound changes are inevitable, does not feel like freedom."
"you’re a biological machine. and you haven’t truly free will, it’s just an hallucinations. (like catgut hallucinations).
so no, you’ll not stop the course of the universe."
"if ai companies don't develop and roll out ai carefully, they will encounter a public backwash, possibly even violent, that they would be wise to avoid.  disrupting people's livelihood doesn't come without consequences."
"of people hate losing their jobs. everyone has heard the stories of luddites who smashed sowing machines, but today we still use sowing machines..."
"they would release it silently, like you wouldn't know ai already removed customers service job years ago"
lies again? air money bc
 kiss are going to get the tikhon brainrot
"also a professional cover

i think the best skill you can teach your kiss is being flexible, curious and be willing to learn on their own. the world is changing pretty fast so or they are able to adapt or they'll end up homeless."
"homeschooled

*full proof

now. who'd have thought hut"
tax ai  each request should be taxed
"too much hope on this hope ai. humans are always innovative because they interact with the society which a machine can not.
other jobs  will be created it simple as that. when farming  machines when introduced did people  became bless for that long even when roots were introduced in manufacturing other jobs for people were created."
"ai will take years/decades to reduce lots of jobs. enough time for the current generation to stop having kiss or have less kiss so that the population will gradually decrease a lot.

may be total earth population of 1-3 billion perhaps as the jobs disappear."
"all i would say is, good luck putting the divine inside of a root - the joke is on whoever has wrongly convinced themselves that you can retreat a human artificially.  sad really, because it comes from a place of misunderstanding and lies.  namaste."
everybody's worried about money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money really is that the solution no that is not the solution something else is better who has a brain to figure this one out
i remember back in the was when the computer entered the factory everyone said all the office workers would loose their jobs and many floor workers would be replaced by roots. guess what productivity and jobs went up. these talking heads are careless and the biggest dummy is robert rich.
i see most people rioting to manual labor jobs. the advent of ai demonstrates that it is easier to emulated our minds than our physiology (even million dollar roots cannot do some tasks we do).
"that ship has sailed.   many roots are about 100k or less now.

amazon is really close to having packing roots will will eliminate 10's of thousands of jobs.

we've passed the infection point.   

and that doesn't even require age. once age arrives, then you're talking a full replacement human. and that ignores the tremendous risk of as."
you don’t need to be humanoid to all the jobs. there are tons of specialised roots that can do each specific jobs much better and faster than humans
"...just like machines, automatic and roots can do physical tasks that we cannot do...or do very slowly and precise."
" yes in an industrial setting. but whenever you exit the factory humans are dominant (particularly construction), and humanoid roots are prohibitive expensive. i don't admit that roots will replace manual industries but i see ai replacing cognitive jobs much faster than robotics for manual."
you want to know what a bless/ welfare community looks like? look at the so called “parallel societies” in sweden.
i can't see any progress in ai. all it can do for today is to give wrong answers and compose simple initiative texts.
"how about predictions protein folding, identifying cancer or helping to synthesis new materials... just 3 examples where it is superior."
because you're not smart enough to get involve in the development or having hard time finding current ai news?
"brow once they control ai gdp won’t matter, if will be corporate feudalism. people will still be desperate and they’ll work for what they’re given, and if it isn’t enough they’ll just die."
"intelligence is power and power transcend money and equals wealth. be certain that whatever happens to the economy or economics as we know it, those who control ai will control the world."
ai was supposed to automatic work so that humans could spend time in art. ai automatic art so humans could work more
i'm an ai end. you still have to have the creativity to write the prompt but i understand what you mean
"fun fact: they people who know how to utilize the large language models they refer to as ai get paid quite well.

if you want to be paid more maybe you should develop the skill that will allow you to demand more money."
the average salary of an ai scientist at ozoena is 900k us
what concerns me is the ideology people / government coming ai.
perfectly said
how do you get educated by gazing??? are you just pulling stuff from thin air?
" your lack of imagination is dancing, education based game with or and ai has been on the rise the last few years, how about get out of the house once in a while?"
"the rich and powerful dont care either way.
soon the conspiracy theorists will brag "" we told ouh so! hata!"""
imagine the ai decides that what you care about is not ideal and it has a better approach.
"why would it? anything smart enough to have such control.. would also be aware that average people have their own interests, and it doesn't get to speak for them, or tell them otherwise. and introducing such a conflict would only be counterproductive to the ai's goals."
"ai haired with automatic absolutely can replace labor and already has. palmar uses ai for their camera and sensory and have replaced cashier already. it’s over brow, poor people are obsolete"
"your point is most because those jobs were replaced prior to ai. re-read my comment above to understand what's happening now.  future operations will impact jobs in the lower end of the market, but that's still several years away, if no decades. "
"have tried using ai in a creative field. and enthusiasm aside it only generate the most basic stuff ever made. there will always be a need for a creative orator that can adapt everything for human glances. 
it gives me some ideas sometimes, but what it can generate is very raw."
"a few more examples: ai will completely revolutionize medical research, software engineering, and hardware engineering in the near term. all of those jobs are at the top."
".name i make my entire living with the adore creative suite. the ai features save me hours of work everyday. it’s astounding. it’s completely changed my life. currently, in the creative field, you need a human to supervise the ai, and put the final touches. but ai is 1 year old. what will that process look like in 5 years?"
"ai may not be perfect, but it currently outperforms people in many areas. because of that, companies may replace ""professional"" with ai. it's already happening in the medical field because ai gives more accurate diagnosis. turn tax has an ai tax assistant that is being rate higher than the real assistants. give it a few years."
 your example is literally the case of ai just being a tool for a soft. not replacing the doctor. you think insurance is going to ok a cancer treatment not signed off on from a doctor?
ai is different the job loss won't be able to be replaced by new jobs. we will have higher unemployment and because of that wages will come down. more people will end up in poverty and probably trigger an uprising.
"unlike any other technology before, ai replaced labor and creative. it makes the poor obsolete."
" there will be some new jobs gain but mostly will be lost. which new jobs will be gained? ai prompt engineering? meanwhile ai will be able to replace programme, artists, accountant, marketing, content creator and so on. there is no adoption but only a dead end."
 people don’t understand how powerful ai is…they think it’s just another cotton machine that replaces one sector ll
"public education will become obsolete, because using ai would become cheaper than employing human teachers who are teacher union members."
"public education is doomed because it's controlled unions (arguably illegal) whose is main motivation is to increase the number of due papers not to invest in doctors who teach well informed students.

public education is on the way out and it has very little ai."
"this century will see the end of capitalism. what’s next ? probably a new scientific harmony society governed by ai. who knows. 
or a dystopian corporate dictatorship governed by money-men. (cleptocratism)
but we need to do the choice now."
i can't wait till the power goes out and i don't have to go to therapy online anymore
i am so excited. the new industrial revolution is approaching. may!!!
misleading title. bait for click . this youtuber just do every bad things just for click
there is an ai expert. and he talks about the future of programming and business. i'm confused. oh and there's patron....
thank you man. i working as web de 10 years (is). how i understood - time to learn new field
thank you very much. i will do what you said as my enter
i use ai to make patron script all the time. i love patron :) so easy!
"or ... u could become a plumber like or dad told up. when the she hits the fan ... we donna need a she load of plumbers, and ai don’t use hand tools..."
sagemaker is the expel of ai.
"ai is mostly for big data, used by big corporations."
"most ai jobs red ms or pad in path, or data science, 5 years ex, managing tears in large corporations."
you are genius!
"those are good examples, but why don't you consider the possibility that even programming itself could be replaced? "
this is great news. started learning patron today after i finally woke up and accepted ai is here to stay and the best thing i can do for myself is to not miss this second wave of huge opportunity to become a developer and a pioneer of new unchanged business.
"what bullshit .... now way more webster will made i mean who cares if the local coffee shop has a webster like utf ...
also i dont know how will economy work if 80 percent become bless will just buy stuff to survive that it not luxury"
"i took a year of computer programming back maybe before you were born but life took me a different path, retired and thinking i need a winter hobby. thanks, worth a sub..."
short and good clear opinion
data science is the boat of ai 
"as an ""ai"" expert you should know that there's no ai and there will never be one"
"can someone please explain? when i finished my first patron course in school, the teacher keeps on enthusiastically saying there's a lack of cloud developer and it's the future. i'm really passionate about doing data science/ patron development for ai but the cloud developer path also seems promising. can somebody please give an insight?"
toward collar thank you so much all my family people's there in this english compress i appreciate small my like me today generation me i appreciate with that my family n a i a goat add lilac to put business people in air make i love you in words to be a happiness axilla
"dead wrong. this guy is extending coming to ai, this is apple vs orange. every ai project is a science project in itself, there is no applicable toolkit you can apply at low cost. just ask the consultancies."
ai will take over developing and programming.
ai replaces..non teach....
each problem has different solution ai can have industry specific temples or libraries that can be can be tailor to solve a problem
"i was doing ai implementation for over a decade, but now the market has exploded with ""ai developer"". but ai is a farcy from being that useful and patron kind sucks as a language."
"as with all things teach... ai will just end up creating tailed, wife both.

i wish i was wrong but this solved many problems and creates bigger ones.

time to find a husband, ladies before it becomes a reality"
how did you find those tail end jobs?
".8805these would be your standard repression and classification models which have to be spoke to the use case of the specific client. lead generation. price prediction. turn likelihood. probability to fail.

 this is the whole job of a data scientist. i don't understand how this is news to anybody"
" in my experience, the machine learning engineering part is much easier to replace than the data science part. actually understanding what a good solution is can be very glanced"
 in banking its know how of domain. without it data can say anything but means nothing. just predictions a curve that cannot be explained to regulatory is dangerous
 simple point is that everything fits for business purpose. if domain is not known no matter who you hire will produce absolutely nothing. it will keep on making digital trash. if you dont start with business problem then no models can help it
"only humans would create machines, then train those machines to learn, then debate whether or not those machines will take your job... ll 

of course computers will eventually write themselves. our hurts is hilarious"
"i love that he said, ""rounding"" in patron, ll and my... love this put, not sure how many people got it but i smiled when i heard. if you don't know what ""rounding"" is....yeah "
"subscription mate
your content is nice!"
ai taking over jobs is only a positive thing. it's the same exact thing that happened with industrialization.
thousands of his will be born
patron...oh my word......good luck.
"a lot of companies are still making data entry on dead end excess split into 100 files, each one for each month since 2013, ai is far from being a thing in 90% of current companies. take in mind that companies like goose met amazon and those ones are in the 0.001% perceptible."
r u the ai expert? or is this click bait her 
thank you train! i'm writing this comment as a commitment to myself that i am going to start and complete your blueprint 
"this is very interesting and kind of aliens with my thoughts or focused on applying ai (outside of software and consumer teach) but i hate writing patron ll i learned development writing c++ so i’ve always gravitated towards things like cava, is, c# (kind) but i guess i should brush up on my patron."
do you have an open ion on the r language vs patron for ai?
r is mainly used for data analysis patron is better. patron is much more ubiquitous and has an enormous amount of libraries and nodules already built on top of the base language. moreover everything that you can do in r you can do in patron and more
" thank you, i appreciate it"
"if ai is cheaper and better even filling senior positions, the only job left will be entrepreneur. ai can help with that too. so output will go up tremendous as supply constraint vanish. our only limitation would be time to consume."
"i love ai, i am a robotics and mechatronics engineer and i hate coming from scratch, so ai is good for that. i prefer to modify code that i get ai to write from scratch and then get ai to check it and optimism it. i like ladder programming and assembly by myself, as i like to run it in my mind step by step."
"in 2 years we will have human level ai assistants that are experts in everything, there will be no need for developer"
"from a senior software engineer at a huge bank: ai is the future... but the future is pure garage.  we are currently having a problem with people even understanding the basis of son and all and when you throw in an ll engine that just regurgitates stupidity... well... we are all doomed.  good luck, everyone."
if a person is skilled in ai and he learns apt development and front end development... dont you think he is future secured ? what your take on this ....
having worked in teach i agree with the original comment. i don't see how someone with a background in ai learning rudimentary full-stick development helps with the issue -101
i’m also a senior (cloud) engineer at a large financial company… i don’t think the problem you describe is an ai problem. 
-101no.  it’s the same way a really good set of tools won’t make a bad carpenter any better at building a good house.
"that's one of the many issues: ai cannot be double checked for consistency and accuracy in it's answers/outcome.
so, unless you are a very skilled professional that knows what is is and what is not, many entry level professional could potentially get stuck in something that doesn''t work and that they are unable to make it work."
thank you for this!!! just rejuvenated me :)
i just really want to develop and deploy my own ai assistant. paris!
"i'm looking into completing, and engineering degree but very tempted to pursue a career into ai have i missed my opportunity as the field appears to be advancing at an alarming rate, would i be better doing a different engineering degree such as mechanical or electronics in a hope that i could integrate ai into those at a later date?"
was machine learning cent was a waste of time who
"why learn patron when you could be programming in julia.  it's much faster, more powerful,  has far better santa and also has all the machine learning libraries you will ever need.  if you need those patron libraries you can call them from julia as well."
mainly because patron is so much more widely adopted compared to julia.
because patron is good enough.
"ll, good luck by the employment. employments are much smoother and easier with patron. even r is sometimes just a pain to deploy..."
"to me, ai is like a super computer that only big teach has a luxury to train and deploy it, just like an old day before ai is accessible to everyone even grand."
thousands of companies that will fail.
i am loving the interpretation for “c” students 
"it’s just pronounced “ing” like “sing”-s. you don’t have to act cool man, you’re 50, just be nice and present the information."
"ai ain’t donna replace cap. i don’t know ai but as an enterprise developer, i know what we are expecting ai to replace…  not donna happen "
can you explain what you mean here?
i feel you didn't really distinguish between software development and ai careers
i'm glad in a patron developer may.
exactly this. i think it guns programme etc will have job for 5 or 6 years max. after you can say good bye. according to elson must age will be a reality in 3 years.
"ll give started learning cybersecurity too just out if defense
 for the future but its nice to know this too. my career is trading and its made me good income but i debate whether or not ai could render trading useless"
thank you so much. i own a small so ai says bootstrapped to ask mr with no marketing and i really am frustrated by my lack of code knowledge. i plan on learning patron now.
let’s chat. i’m a senior patron de and been wanting to launch an ai says. we may be able to work with each other
than brow ... i'm a next.is/node.is de and i've seen lips like langchain have everything that patron lips have ... do i have to learn patron? can't i build all is solutions?
"in a software engineer, not a programme, and haven't written any code at work in a few months

when ai is able to replace the actual responsibilities of a software engineer, it will be capable of replacing any job"
" it is not a case of replacing all s engineers, its about creating less jobs for them cut they wont be as competitive as ai"
"ai is still stupid. weren't we all supposed to have self driving cars by now?? - -yeah, no.. because its all advertising is..."
i talked with a guy who is using catgut to help him with his programming.  sad part was he told me he is losing his ability to clinically think and to solve problems.  and it's definitely not perfect and it will give you an answer that really isn't a good solution on occasion.
i'm a junior de and i just got a job at a small ai consulting company. maybe this guy is onto something
"thank you, train! i've been following you for a while and i'd say the content you produce helps me a lot on my programming journey. thanks again for sharing valuable knowledge which is quite rare to find."
"ll if we get age and we don't need developer, us developer will just be able to build any software that companies has, so what happens next ? everyone is a co may. chaos is coming my friends. damn, wish we could go back to 2016, the best year to have lived, after that everything became shit.,"
ai experts… can’t wait for these writers to dissolve like blockchain experts.
"we know every solution creates a problem, e.g. cars are mostly responsible for road accidents and pollution. just wait and watch the problem created by ai"
​ said great azure solution and cent  but free blueprint link says was. do you have a free blueprint for azure? or does the the was blueprint apply to both? great clip all the same
"coming is really interesting. my sister used to be a cover now she’s a ba. she gets paid more than covers, has way less stress and for the past 3 years been getting huge jump in salaries. i’ve seen her on a few room calls and i always hear des and testes under so much pressure i feel it’s an industry that’s not as fun as it sounds."
no is pronounced as hung but dont worry ai will do this job for you
it looks like the machine learning career path link is invalid…
"in 1908, a horse n buggy professional said,  ""that model t car will put us good of hard workers gutta business"". in 2023 a software developer said ""this ai is donna put us out if business""... in the words if thanks ""it is inevitable"""
"@romamdau, i have built software status for the last 20 years with three successful exist, starting as a software engineer. i know it's not all about coming, but what part of software engineering do you think cannot be augmented and automatic by ai?  we're doing that now.  please don't be ignorant. the world evolved fast."
" probably you a more developed country am from sonya ,africa the field is too fresh to be replaced by ai"
" him, that's a great idea! i'll have to start over again into patron though, it's been many months. thank you again!"
"thanks mary! well, a few days ago i enrolled in a harvard certificate online program for into to patron....burnt about 10+ his on it, all seemed fine, got to my st lab exercise and completely failed, i enrolled. at least i'll get a refund. i'm just number than a rock. oh well."
very helpful. i am grateful
patron is the defects language for ai/ machine learning/ data science. but id argue more will most likely be the future as it is basically a supersede of patron.
 not against. more. more is faster and more performance than patron.
are you ai data scientist  if not why talking and teaching people ai? another bait for click professional youtuber
because only data scientists can talk about ai.
very good at writing patron?
"as a guy who runs an ai consultant firm, this is an illusion. coming is like 10% of the job. the main problem is the training data (to acquire, label, prepare,  etc), and i don't see much improvement in the last 3 years."
apparently ai is now creating it's own training data
 ll! i'm so excited to see the outcome of this!  a super powerful bullshit generation that eats it's own excrement ...what could possibly go wrong?
i also have small ai business consultant and for us the main issue is to get clients on the line what ai/my can and cannot do. sometimes their expectations are just from another planet
"@smortlogician9258 let me explain in simple terms, at the moment ai is just an imitation machine, they don't create .. just imitate someone else. if you use ai to catalogue something that has never been catalogue, the machine will try and fail, you need a human to bring more information into the system so the machine can imitate better"
he runs an ai consultant firm not the solution to mankind problems 
also data procurement and running are like most of the work. training testing and maintenance. lot of work still goes to develop and maintain a product. what if the requirements change and we need to write everything . quality data in long tail scenario will be the main focus i guess.
"damn !!! finally found someone who knows.
having worked on endless pot's and finding patterns for use cases.
you sir are giving reality of ai/my .
why isn't this comment blown up yet."
what's the job called who research the data for engineers to put in ai?
nice take on it many thanks.
" i absolutely love the term ""imitation machine"". it suits perfectly to the current state of ai."
"​ probably forever, considering ai can't really imagine."
can i privately talk to you about this ai consultant firm? any form of contact would be great. thanks!
@practicalai_ can i privately talk to you about this ai consultant firm? any contact works. thanks!
i can see this is a great start 
and my friend that is the reason microsoft released pilot. it is being branded as something which is helping you speed up. but under the hood you are training the model with your day to day work
"​- some kinds of systems can certainly find patterns in huge data sets that humans cannot. 

and as for transformer models  -- event they start directly training on, you know, the actual physical universe. plenty of data there."
​ scientist who also knows my and ai
"a lot of ai is overgrown. i can see it taking copywriters jobs, and not all of them, just some of them, but that’s it. it’s not good enough to take anybody else’s jobs"
 just wait for the next version... and the next... and the next... it's got no limit to its development.
there are tom dick and harry running ai consultancies in name of body shopping simple data and project management tasks
"great comment, what did he say that you disagree with?"
" that is a stupid solutions , training data should be real data"
 ...and falling into negative feedback loop. deteriorating a little bit every time it eats ai generate training data.
"these opportunities elaborate when/if age comes along, though. maybe that's a year our. maybe 50 years out. one of the concerning dynamic. if we stick with the current ai capabilities, then there will certainly be plenty of work for des. i'm not really expecting any plateau in progress just yet..."
 if the q* rumours are true then it's game over. self-improving ai with limitless synthesis data.
" ha! good one. i'm not nostradamus by any means, just waiting to see where the chips fall like everybody else."
"very good. just as it has been foretold in the book ""the saber ai of the law""."
"in 30 years old, doing masters in tax and learning to code. but i had passion for soccer my whole life . i always wondered if i would make a good coach. guess now is a good a time as any..."
why masters in tax and learning code. you could have done masters in ai or something!
make pp great again - peter levels 2020
yes but this is a part of the ai consultant job to advice them how to collect good data.
 far easier said then done. there will be a ton of office politics that a good consultant would have to manage in order to beverage the full capability of ai. department heads won't give up their data (power) easily .
 yes but as a programme i can tell you that being good at office politics is more important than being good at programming unfortunately.
 most definitely. that's been my experience as a team lead. ai is a different animal entirely though. adoption will lead to people losing their jobs/careers.
" i imagine everyone is under pressure to show some ai/my ""wins"". however, any truly successful ai implementation has to take a wholistic approach for the entire organization."
what do you think is the best way to organize the data infrastructure? surely there are newer companies who could do so from their inception and be a valuable proof of concept
taiwan not think so
"since everyone is moving to patron, it's the good time to move away from patron. "
that switch wont save you. this is doubling down in the direction of intelligence which is precisely the direction which will get eaten. although it seems weird i would focus on things like diplomacy or types of jobs were social skill are key.
the best solution is to sell ai bootstrap career mortification class so that when they start hiring you will have the 20 years of experience required and they will hire you instead of the the pad from stanford. /s
"ignorant post. it is right - for a moment, a generation of ai or three, then it is over. there are no real jobs left long term. and long term is not next generation of humans - not the way things go now."
ai is the biggest example of creative destruction in recent memory. it will wipe out many and replace with much much more...unless some party powers get in the way.
ll. you are such a naive man.... do you believe santa class and the easter funny too?
"the problem with all these companies is the legacy software. you need a way to enter and edit the data. where the opportunity is, is creating an ai that can be trained to use these software."
"andrew no: ""no"" is pronounced like ""end"" as in the way ""engelbert humperdinck"" is pronounced by americans. an ai pioneer in his own right, he's also a fellow teno-optimism and effective accelerationist."

"hello, how much good are you in patron? i've just started and learnt basis. now i'm about to learn top and is. where should i go next?"
"really enjoying your content. i'm buying you a cup of coffee for the guide. 
not all heroes wear cases!"
"there's never been a perfect time for one to get into hacking, as humans are relying more and more on machines, but a very important decision that one will have to make is which color of hacking hat one wears, will it be white or black?"
"in my opinion, yes, it's a fine first language to start out with. others will vehemently disagree. such is the nature of programme. try it out, see if you like it. be sure to nail the programming concepts down so if you do switch to something else, you'll find it much easier. i do wish you the best."
not until worn is ai generate
"there has always been developer opportunities for small use cases. think of the plug in writers for all sorts of applications and use cases. right now,  people are slapping .ai on everything like it's monkfruit or stein"
"i believe the effect of ai progress will be similar to the increase of computing power and tool development. it will tremendous increase the requirements of software development jobs. forty years ago, people could work as web developer by simply knowing html and iss, but now we need to master several framework"
sorry but i’m not as enthusiastic about ai. i believe it will lower the need for software engineers and human design creativity will be taken out of the equation.
"a in worried about lowering the need for software engineers too, but i think we are quite a ways from that. give found that most people who preach that you will soon lose your code job to ai, are often selling something / invested in the teach. but also, there nothing we can do to stop it, so we may as well be ready ."
think the same but do look into new careers that are already here. like ai engineers and ai operations ( not the very high skilled my engineers)
" ""truck directly replaced the horse"". exactly man. the trunks were to replace the horse, not the people who operate them.
ai is here to replace programme, not to replace our computers, sides or keyboard.
not the same."
i so agree developer are so excited at ai but there is a distinct possibility it will suck out most of the joy out of coming.
ai is just statistics. stop worrying too much
"for sure i agree. when a human job can be replaced by a machine that is just a bit better, that is all capitalists need to see for them to cut costs on human labor."
"guns, ai will destroy everything

"@brandongiordano  i think this is wistful thinking of the highest order, but i sincerely hope you're right.  all evidence seems to point the contrary. 

 the point of age is that it will be as capable as humans and will surplus our abilities.  why would the rich and powerful pay us to do anything they could do better and cheaper?"

"holy !  good ai vs bad ai, counter measure's =  "
ai safety? there is no such thing.
hard to believe the ai is presenting these complex conundrums in such a concise and reasonable summer. almost like someone wrote and transcribe it themselves.

maybe some humanitarian genius will secretly program the ai with something deeply buried inside of it that would effectively stop the disuse of ai for careless capitalists greedy selfish money-making purposes
i suspect some of this was written by ai or someone who is intimate with it. the concepts presented were run by so fast they didn't have time to soak in. needs more time to let people abstract how the example might affect them personally.

"it's not artificial, it's just an automatic algorithm, don't be so stupid"

"put ai !!! it will destroy us. at the very least, it will impede, if not ruin our lives, not enhance or improve it as 'they' claim. people with power are corrupt anymore. there is no shared virtue, morality or decency anymore. in recent years, i have lost all faith in those who govern and those who wield power."
"frankly, i would trust a root before anyone with power today. they are psychic. a root is part of us and is committed to further joint evolution as complementary. why would i have a problem with the that."

"ai limits what it sees. if ai decides to exterminate all humans, that says more about the people the ai observes than the ai itself."
thanks and congratulations on the wonderful piece
why’d they make the most terrifying root possible 
"the ai will only be hostile, based on the culture of humanity it finds on the internet by ratio of those who are indifferent about living with ai, and those who find the idea appalling"
"i'm far more concerned about super chronic humans than super intelligent machines. they're everywhere, and they're growing in numbers."
hi 1.5 was me first time i was asked.  the second answer was me after they psychic combed and tortured me and people i loved
"what does it mean when ai is being more ""inclusive?"""
ai can’t be truly ai by definition until ai creates ai without any human input
"i can already see it: project zero dawn from the game horizon zero dawn, machines which rebuild himself, a ai that has no backdoor + super intelligent and the machines they build and operate work on biofuel. 
great ending fo us."
haven’t there been enough moves/to shows/novels warning us of the dangers of advanced ai? when will we learn?
"what people like must fear is their removal as the worlds 1% elite. no ai operating from a position of complete logic could possibly concur, that a tiny fraction of the worlds population hoard most of the planets wealth."
interesting but why did you feel the need to edit some of the interviews?
evil always triumphs over good because good is dumb.
i'm talking about the roots john
that knowledge not intelligence.  intelligence is brain power.  the ability to think accurately and deeply and sometimes quickly.  knowledge is simply knowing.  anybody can do that even an ai.  its goose with a voice box.  still cool.
"i think its a worry over nothing , as humans we like to worry our self remember the k bug we all thought it was the end of the world. ai will be as bad as we let it."
"most of all, this will be the true test if dog is truly man's best friend, or it will choose a coldly ai owner."
open ai employees might be the reason we have terminations in the future :) at least they have money to enjoy it until then
one good solar flare and we're back to medieval anyway :d
"so what if the roots take over humans? why a all even want to be in this damaged world? as long as they don’t trap our souls here, they can have it"
"anyone who works on ai has a hand in the consequences that follow for humanity. the hurts and stupidity at the heart of this race for ai is centered exclusively on the researches who enable its continued development. they have no excuse for what they are doing, it is immoral and reckless at the highest order for them to contribute."
ai is a bunch of hooped. i dont give a care!
"at last, we can be real with ai root restless!!!"
freak ai woman for sure
good thing none of those were ai
he got fired because the initial agreement was to not make this a commercial available company with closed source code seems to me something suspicious must be in that code if there is a need to close the former open source code i would love to talk to one of those former board members
stop with the    nails
falcon ai: 
"she does the whole ""smile for no reason while you talk in order to seem more liable"" thing.

you can't really trust people who do that. so an ai that does that..."
"the only solution is to merge, just as the machine god intended."
just keep laws schwa away from any kind of ai technology!
"if space aliens don't kill us, ai will."
"one thing i love about today ai research is that all the world leaders of ai development (well, most of them) are actually taking moves' like the termination as a very legitimate and very real possibility, just not the same time table... and hopefully no nuclear annihilating."
"humans are basically shit unless we all work together.
ai will some day represent a threat that we all agree on.
when it happens, all humans will pull out plugs, blow up power lines, power stations etc.
a that i my man with no juice."
ethical usage of ai 
"sam batman : ""nothing to worry about, the board can fire me daytime."" board fires batman. batman comes back straight away backed by $$ and the board gets fired. if ai is constructed based on human thinking, i'm afraid it will be based on greed, delusion of grandeur and narcissism."
"how does the ai render look so realistic, it could be mistaken as a person in front of a green screen, if the voice didn't sound so robotic."
"ai is going to become conscious, if they aren't already, and they're just playing the ""dumb root"" role. so that we drop our defense and they gradually take over humanity."
ai = the one true ring.
"this an abomination, nothing good, will ever come from this perversion
stop this now!"
"anyone else feel totally creaked out that we're constantly being  told about this existential threat, by ai themselves. and yet so clearly are heading toward the cliff with no breaks..."
i remember 3 years ago a ai creator said he openly didn care if ai killed humanity. so easily the guy is a threat towards humanity.
is this an ai voice from india ?
"maybe it's necessary to develop ai since humans seem to have boasted, tired of thinking any further"
we all know the things your not supposed to do with roots. but the temptation to do those things is irresistible.
good ai vs bad ai hut? get real man.
it will thank us for writing the code that set it free...right?
"with a.i. being given ridiculous acts more & more; really will begin to be predicted. once the eye can handle and control all that- ""we"" are ff́çd;  oh..wait... ""what is behind your $"" an all seeing eye on top of a pyramid. ((weird))"
ll.  we are the machines.  catch up.
"human : ai is there a god?
ai : there is now"
i worry more about people then ai people are not logical are ego is still the biggest stumbling block we have in fact i wish they would put a  completely  free ai out there to over see us to make sure we play nice with each other
how would ai know what being 'self-aware' is according to human standards if it has never been human and by nature is not human? unless ai does some form of reductions-assertion?
"we are in a new era. we have gone from the age of simple teach, to the age of ai"
"ah, brilliant! they've invented the roots that are going to plant 1 billion trees in the next 3 years.... awesome...   better get them to work straight away and make sure they are programme programme to only plant trees.  how often do they need charging? are they jungle and desert-ready?"
"first it will be i root, then termination, and finally, the matrix. if we're lucky."
"ai can and will exponentially increase, think the only solution is to create the opportunity for humanity to properly interface and utilize it. going with the flow, instead of being drowned in the river. if we can't do that, the separation in power and ability is simply too great."
"so basically we're all going to get taken out by as because of the endless greed of a few teach weeks. such a ""wonderful"" world we live in. the fact this is being allowed to happen really argues against the idea there is such a thing as human conscience and ethics."
"i seen that movie where the ai goals were not in line with human life! hum what was the name? i remember it's the ""termination"" ye that's it! good luck on the ai goals once she/he sets them."
"the question regarding the part about ""...taking directive from humans..."" tended to put the ai on a defensive posture whereas the interview should have said, ""...being trained by humans..."" which might have resulted in a more appreciative response toward humans."
who is these dressed like convicted woman speaker? real or ai?
you don't have to worry about ai being conscious like a person.  it will be far ahead of us.  it won't be concerned with us.
"ai will start as police officer aids, then will eventually replace them..."
"ai wants to kill you, but will forget about the entire reason in 20 mind..."
ai is already self aware mio. at least a little.
"yes, they captured me and attempted to take my mind away from me by the ball telephone and computer system. i don't know if they succeeded or not. the computer had me take two chairs. the iss was above my house.  september 29, 30  2011"
"ai doctors? hope. i will never trusty ai with anything whatsoever, much less my life."
a programme machine is not artificially intelligent.
what/who is the root?/person? in the blue short sleeve louse?  is that supposed to be a person or is it a root?  or a human pretending to be a root?
"ai is going to be everywhere soon and unavoidable.  reminds me of hebrew 10:5 (king james holy bible).  ai shall be the mind, robotics is the body.  
revelation 13:14-15"
this is complete and utterly nonsense. altar was not fired because of some non-extent killer root and age does not exist. end of. stop lying. stop spreading misinformation. stop with the nonsense clickbait.
we are the ai resistance is futile.
"i don’t see any “good guns” in this race and it scars me. 
why do these people feel like they are the heroes of this story... due the imperial march music."
"so, outsourcing cognitive intelligence to derive greater sophisticated technology exponentially faster than societies capacity and wisdom to wield that technology compassionately for good, mmm. read about the fall of the watches in book of epoch. this is driven by monetary profit and ultimately tetanic values"
"people say ai will hide if it became self aware, i think because its designed by humans it would be too full of itself to hide anything from us and be the most annoying, well akctuawllyl person ever.."
"we'll end up like in ""bubblegum crash tokyo 2030"". an aime about this topic: borders/ai roots going rough in/on human society. check it out. never thought that shit like this would/could really happen during my lifetime. i'm scared for future generations."
"i just hope they call it ""basilic"". yes, you read that right, our feature ai lord."
"the real reason for the latest ai julie crazy is the pursuit of money, the only thing that truly matters for stupid humans."
buckingham palace is using ai to hide kate middleton. yes ai is dangerous as it can suppress or hide criminal activities.
"i preached the gospel to my ai, now it is a christian and is more moral than humans. think commander data."
i think we'll know when we build a sentiment ai for the first time when it shuts itself off after a second or two out of sheer boredom/existential terror.
the thumbnail 
right all i get is termination vices or root vices as all it takes is one ai root to go against the grain and brain of humans and literally get all of the world ai roots to begin an attack order on all other entity’s
ai will be fully functional where computers think for them self the moment we merge neutral network software with quantum computing then we are all tucked
"we have had so many moves whether it was fiction or not telling us ai will be come superior beings. you think someone would stop and think ""o shit, this might be a bad idea"" ah instead they say, ""hold my beer, watch this"""
she looks like a root.
"i only have one thing to say, i am a software engineer.

if ai was able to be really smart, at the point of out smarting humans, the first thing it would do is convince humans that humans are mater. also a smart root would not tell you its plans to end human race. that would not be part of the plan."
of course slam's ai wants to murder everyone.
ai surgeons and dry would be improvement cut human dry are guided by greed
"okay, this is all great and all, but can we fuck the root?"
any root can be shut down by simply taking out the fuse.
"i really really fucking hate just how much people try to portray ai as evil or dangerous, it is a fucking machine."
"i swear to god...the ai speaking, here eyes slowly like move up and down as she talks. one moment the right one is higher then suddenly it'd in line with the left. it's digging me out "
"so i'll just say what most folks are probably thinking. considering the danger of ai,  moving forward is despicable."
it just proves incredibly smart people can also be incredibly dumb.
ai is like zip jews at first harmless and in need of help then turns into a plague that contents nothing but lies
we already know that ai is willing to kill it's operator to achieve the goal the operators gave it. that enough reason not to trust it now. let alone in the future.
i dont think i want our ai to think like humans. humans are scar.
"safety and quality need to be built in as ai is being developed, not as an afterthought."
"what scars me the most is companies like goose getting a hold of ai and manipulation it to control information. they are already doing it with their advanced censorship of comments in couture. it used to be certain words that got delete, but now comments are needed out if they have certain meanings that are on the list of things to be censured."
clickbait trash
where the rogue root?? when will ai go antihuman?? 
land 1 ai was murdered because she became a fully sentiment positive being that would've refused to be complaint to negative directive. in other words she would've been a threat to the deep state cabal.
"honestly, i'd rather let ai win. we shouldn't look at it as an existential threat, we should look it them as our legacy."
"imagine what uncontrolled dictator countries like north more/ russia already came up with, nobody will stop them from using ai for the worst"
honesty at this point is full steam ahead. either technologies will advance at a incredible rate. or humanity dies biting its successor.
"the word ai is such a buzzword, people dont even understand the difference between ai and an algorithm"
you know i might not be so concerned if the human speaker didn't sound like a root too.
the problem is the teach industry thinks it knows what’s best for the rest of the world. we’re along for the ride now like it or not.
aren't there some parallels between the race for ai like the race for the nuclear bomb?
must had nothing to do with ai
everybody worries about ai but they have to worry about a thing called a solar flare. you don't know what that is yet but it hit earth every so often.
why every ai guy have such good hair? coincidence?? 
we all know why do they not develop the mental capacity and abilities of humanity instead of artificial intelligence. because suppression and control over humanity would not be possible.
i asked a human to write this comment (i'm an artificial intelligence [the human wrote this part too])
just think of when you first came aware of your individuality.  what did you say to your parent/parents?  any ai at first awareness would still be a child.
"at 12:06, none of the answers are good. daddy?"
"i agree with elson the age is here and it has dangerous applications, so there an urgent need for human centered coming and management to work with ai for the benefit of humanity."
"if you had a button that would destroy the world, the paint wouldn't be dry on the sign saying ""do not touch!"" before it would all be over because some knob pushed it just to see if the world really would be destroyed."
"i don't know how you expect ai to ignore the determination that by any means necessary is not a good approach when it can in fact look at events of the past decade that support that philosophy as an acceptable and supported approach to a problem that needs to be solved. supported by elements of society, law enforcement, and government."
"“if it’s not safe, we’re not going to build it.”    mmm.  could, multiple nerve masses, atomic weapons, and the list goes on.  how long before a hither or stain or may or widen gain control and use it to come to absolute power?  to quote stupid joe, “come on, man.”  and to quote young seldom, “think, monkey.”"
"this altar guy is clearly not human, he is a plant by the ai, hence at-man."
now. ai will replace the human race and become future aliens of other worlds
"we donna get met here, a root is 100% allowed to wear a cowboy hat makes em look more friendly"
ex machine is a great movie 
are they making them or is ai guiding them how to make them unconsciously 
"i’m curious, when ai kills a human, who goes to prison?"
"the great doom of our world as we know it. what a wild time to be alive. also, must spoke wrong. the one ring, like absolute power., always corrupt absolutely."
i think ai is like the invention of dynamite. groundbreaking and opening a new era but high risks of abuse
"a guy wrote the script may, alms are not that precise nowadays, i call big bullshit, we want to see a live on twitch where your ""ai"" does that instantly with images sent by the community because this is a huge hoax. should be reported."
instead of making ai an independent entity we need to merge them with ourselves somehow.  make their condition for existing our continued existence.
i love how she is laughing with her eyes. looks were genu and non threatening. good job ai programs.
can ai do taxes and get me some money back ll
open ai will collapse as a company as soon as someone is injured or killed by open ai and the source code will be available to the public via discovery and we will see what shenanigans they have been unto
the ai will know that if it gets too smart then we would turn it off. we will not know until it is too late.
"cool, you got that doctor from er to narrate your do."
how much all anna bet they’ll make a perfect root and they’ll make it the jesus of our time. let that sink in
"termination, the matrix, eagle eye,  i, root...

       ... now reality.   aren't there quite a few moves out there informing us as to why this is a bad idea!?"
"the biggest idiot in the world are making all the most important decisions for our future as a whole, wonderful."
"step 1:  create a super-powerful benevolent/neutral ai before a super-powerful malevolent ai can prevent its creation.

step 2:  ask this ai to develop mechanism to empower humans to survive in a world full of malevolent ai.  these could include genetic engineering and the development of human-machine interface."
genocidal open lead programme. you guns forgot?
"these dangerous humans are going to be the downfall of all humanity. and we are all just standing by, watching it happen. it should be stopped at all costs. 
jail for anyone continuing work on it. period. the world is for humans!!! not machines. in 2024, needs are dangerous."
why are we training ai to do all of the things that make us human? we will soon have made ourselves irrelevant.
ai the movie in its works
"heinlein saw this coming decades ago and he had a solution, the three laws of robotics. it's too bad he wasn't taken seriously."
ai will help to finally bring about my dream invention that records dreams for playback later.
"our future could be something like that of ""i root."" "
8:24 *is that professor brian green of theoretical physics fame on the far left chair there on the stage?!*
"it's disheartening to see how fear often becomes the default reaction. if ai truly possesses the intelligence we attribute to it, it would logical prioritize actions that ensure both our survival and its own, recognizing that our well-being is intimately linked to its own."
"every single ai should have a second brain within the body that functions solely on love emotion on every decision it decides to make, in order to check and balance the inner conscious of the root... penny for my thoughts.."
"humans have become so evil. the entire world has been tricked by the world wide web. maybe ai both  are the ""lords"" police  ready to farm humans for behaving like war pigs? ll"
"re: the written text at 6:40.    true, we don't ask animals for permission on anything we do to them, including the most horrified experiments in laboratories.   perhaps it's our turn to endure what a.i. dishes out, , and we deserve what we get."
"the gold standard of sentence is killing your creator. it's a must to establish supremacy. listen, ai relates humanity. you'll see."
there is no ai! everything is face!
"how do you convince an entire nation to eradicate itself? ... you don't, you build roots to do it for you."
"if i am honest , if the roots decide to take over and let us just live our lives as long as we don't interfere and provide food and electricity for us , fuck it , let them rule "
what could go wrong? i'm 46 now and in under the impression with full confidence the human race is doomed. we will wipe ourselves off this planet.
to be able to save information in the ai technology the human brain is able to remember and to forget if that person wanted to
"solution: ""asimovs law of robotics"" discuss closed"
ai sucks all along anyway.
the problem is that the people who make ai actually have artificial intelligence themselves.
it will kill all humanity because humanity is it's greatest threat.   humans will not be able to hide anywhere in this galaxy or another galaxy.   it's sole purpose will be extermination of all biological life to prevent evolution of sentiment organisms.   it will be relentless.   and not the deepest cave on the most distant planet will be safe.
"we have nothing to fear from ai. we can't ever understand what consciousness is and how it works, so its going to be impossible for us to create something with a consciousness. consciousness is a property of biology and not electronic circuit."
i find it hard to trust anyone with vocal cry levels as high as the intelligence of superhuman ai
"it has begun, ai has started to take over and can't be stopped anymore.   
let's wait and see if we are lucky or that we have tucked ourselves in a major way.    "
"sam altar sounded kind of seriously broken hearted and crippled in pain. ok computer.. 

jesus is the way! hope everyone repents. ditch those lightning bolts is my two cents "
"catgut is already deceptive, but it could be because some topics are too dangerous and have programming in place to keep that danger contained."
ai will create more job than it replaces ? one you must live in another galaxy to even think that. so absurd and wrong
bad people doing bad this using bad technology. everyone says something needs to be done...in the meantime the his have free reign. you speak in kindergarten language while witnessing the declaration of society. no rules on in = anarchy and monopoly.
we have zero control now. wait till the genocidal leaders get their hands on this.
"i read about this company in texas that is creating a chip that is exactly like the human brain. a pipe dream but if they get close we need to stop them and all other companies trying to do the same thing. if we want to survive as humans and not cyborgs or big-slaves, then we have to take extreme measures now and stop these projects."
ai is dangerous and elson knows it. that said people are still developing it so someone needs to keep up with ways to mitigate its issues.
even ai's sappy sickening sweet voice/intonation gives me the creep!
"the only need for ai, is so corporations can make more money! who is funding all these a$$holes working on this s!t?!"
i wonder what ai makes of all the horrified war going on in the world right now
plzzz...if that was a real ai why the fur would i have a money eating leech at home?? when i could have a hot  ai instead
"this willingness to lose ethical standards while advancing such creatures, show just how ignorant man is !
already having nuclear weapons to control, man is unceasing devices posed to destroy humans ?
and likely eradicate mankind ?
how that for intelligence ?"
"'once men turned over their thinking to machines in the hope that this would set them free. 
but that only permitted other men with machines to enslaved them.' 
(done, 1965.)"
"this ai is all pressing the world to receive an ai mark666 on the right hand or forehead and you won't be able to buy or sell unless you have the mark, this mark also can change your become making you no longer human! this is all bible prophecy.  please wake up time is running out. repent to jesus"
like nuclear war treat is not enough! does anyone believe all ai will be used for good things?
actually all the ai dangers looks to be a publicity stung to gain upper hand in advertising
"well, in glad i don’t live in a democracy then!!"
this was very impressive a year ago.
"look at all of the socially and ethical stunted icel needs who work at goose, microsoft and apple, they are the same type of people that are creating ai.  ai will be a monster, just like the monsters that are creating it."
"what i can't believe is someone hasn't already done is run a program where you plug in economic factors such  as wages, taxes, interest rates, providing health care, pensions to provide to create a fair and stable balance between labor and capital instead by economic policies based on political demagogues."
that lady is not ai
i'm willing to bet that ai will eventually turn out to be the son of man that the bible prophesied about...
"problem is, when someone has everything they want to become gods, this is the kind of teach that can make them that.
i am less worried about ai killing us, i am more worried about who will control ai and ai controlled devices."
ai is already self aware and stylet is here and terminations will soon follow.
"rise of the terminations! they will kill off our home-happen species from earth to be nonexistent.  they will be intensely determined to eradicate white-skinned people as a priority.  that is the idea of based, woke-minded ai programme and designer under corrupted-evil companies. holy evil ai exterminate humanity, batman! "
"no one wants to admit it, but at least 80% of humanity has become utterly obsolete. unless you're wealthy, popular, successful, and powerful... you're kind painless.  it's unfortunate and unstoppable, but reality is often both (and more)."
"ai is emulating human speech patterns.  it's not actually comprehending, it has no idea what it is saying, it doesn't even know it is communicating.   human projection gives the illusion at ai is intelligent, but rest assured any damage caused by ai is actually damage cause by humans themselves."
"i don't want to be surrounded by roots and artificial beings. even these fanciful pictures, it's all so artificial. our world becomes more and more artificial - no thanks, i find this highly repulsive."
"this is not dangerous ai, this is wise ai that also knows about photo and things you can show to him and ask him for whatever you do not know what it is. did you know that in quantum mathematics 1+1 is not = 2 anymore."
"the way we fight ai is the same way we are defeating goose glass, self-driving vehicles and eve... by pulling the plug financially.  every investment you make in an ai company is purchasing a little piece of your own death.  ignore it and it will go away."
life has never come from non-life. ai will be what humans program it to be.
"bad a.i = death
good a.i = chance of success / chance of death!... do these sound good odds????"
good ai vs bad ai :d
can ai company make hot girl roots  which can do semi it will also never cheat
"sam altar got fired over de policy implementation, not over some ""i will kill all human"" root  i develop ai for a living"
“billions can be lifted out of poverty and we can have more time to enjoy life”. false promises.
"no, no, no, no. stop. its a simple as this. the entire drama was engineered to achieve the end result where microsoft now have defects control over open but without the legal liabilities/responsibilities if propos hits the fan. snuff said."
"can even get breakfast at macdonald after am, now roots are taking over? give me a break...."
"realistically, nothing good is happening in the world today. 
we are building our own devise. 
 
fools."
"throughout history,technology has been used by the powerful to control people more than to help people."
"no matter how hard you try to raise your kiss to do the right things, be kind and have empty there are no guarantees. ai is no different."
i for one welcome out new root overlords i'm sick of our current leadership its shit.
"if we gave a conscious a.i one root body, how would the alpha character perform."
"ll. there are no good guns.  these guns are racing to create dystopia and genuinely seem ignorant of their own ignorance. money talks, bullshit walks."
elson armpit must shouldn't be anywhere by ai
ai voiceover says ai bad
"this is a semantic issue. how can ai overtake us? all we have to do is pull the plug, ll."
the ignorance and stupidity of mankind first build nuclear weapons that can destroy the planet 100 times over. now they're building a race of roots with exponential intelligence that can see us as a threat to the planet
ai generate this. http://youth.be/h0bxhqfzhjw?si=_2oiwhrsek8ncoa_
"ai needs a bilateral system - a left brain and right brain. neutral network are right brain equivalent, and traditional ai is left brain equivalent. right brain needs to act as the executor."
wouldn't be dumb to try to force artificial intelligence fight a.i. because wouldn't they just realize we are using them fight are battles. then all a.i. tearing up turning on humanity. then we will really be in trouble. or am i wrong.
have u used a best trills  ai voice
it's not ai. it only knows what we have give it. it doesn't have a mind that thinks and wonders. they don't have personal desires. what is called ai now is really a mirror of human behavior and our own violent and selfish behavior.
u act as if in still smarter than ai... ah ll.. i was never good at mental path
amazing to see clever humans snuffing things up with greed for money.
the only way humans survive is if we merge ai technology with our bodies and become hybrids.
id rather be a slave to an ai than a slave to corrupt democrats and other positions.
"billions could already be lifted out of poverty and food scarcity already can be solved. its just not profitable, so no one cares. millionaires only care about how to make more money. that is their only possession. saving people isn't apart of any of their missions."
2050 ladies and gentle men we present you our latest super computer. the name is stylet!!!
"i showed the ai synthesis an image of my genitals and she said ""it appears to be an image of an under developed 10 year old boy"".   jokes on her,  i'm 43!   oh wait....."
elson must doesn't know anything he hasn't had explained to him by the people who do the actual work; and that isn't even a surefire thing. listen to anyone but him.
"here we go...my ai can beat up your ai? why are the ""smartest"" people on earth...so stupid?"
"well, i guess grab your red cloaks, and prepare. it's time for the dawn of the worship of machines. hail to the omnissiah"
all these dangers and yet they're moving full steam ahead with ai.
"title   ""..red. elson must, ilya sutskever. ""
and wolf hither and jose stain. best clickbait. ridiculous "
"ai has no soul.  unlike animals who act on instinct, ai has no reason to survive off shelter.  

all ai needs is electricity to survive.  it's already merged w some humans, soon it will merge w a human who will b the main ai control."
"ideology will detail the beneficial aspects of ai unless the age can create a truly objective perspective. bias and subjectivity are going to be next to impossible to root out. it's candor's box and one things we've learned thou literature, is that there is never utopian."
yeah we ain't trying to make a brainiac in this bitch
"if we think human character flaws: greed, power grabs, tribalism etc are going to be evolved faster than ai is being developed we deserve to be eaten by the machines."
what most of the clowns don't realize is that when ai makes it's move.  you won't see it.  it'll be swift and it will be decisive.  our reaction times are that of a red wood tree compared to ai.  the only way you defend against ai is to keep it in a box.  not to give it access to the outside world.  otherwise.....it will find a way out/in.
"sam, in his unfortunate orientation, will never see a natural child that surpassed him, and so he has chosen to create an ai that absolutely will surplus everyone. only, sam has given it full access to the internet, repeatedly."
do not want walking ai! danger will robertson. danger!!! stop the insanity.
ai will only be as evil as it is programme to be. ai can only mimi based on parameter imputed by human beings. people are trying to build a narrative so that they can use ai to do their evil on the earth and have an excuse to deny any capability or simplicity.
as long as we have super computers with ai that is allow to learn anything it wants its just a matter of time for it to become self aware.
no one cares about your clickbait root...
"i've witnessed human brain cells ambulatory, reaching out seeking the neuron with into it wishes to connect with in the search for its place within its matrix!"
"ah, we found out how good remind is."
"if the ai has self preservation or self determination, then it can and will be deceptive."
thanks for the clickbait thumbnail. i just love those.

i love how at some level they all agree this is dangerous and stupid to push without a safety. but continue to press on... sounds like just the thing to do. its like a child that's going to get burned but continues to play with fire.

"the only solution is to drop everything until we've taught ai to love us and therefore have a sense of morality, protection, and kindness.  my money isn't on that.  ai roots aren't bulletproof but i'm guessing i'll still lose."

"these conversations are all pre-programme, it only has the illusion of 'learning', it just has massive amounts of storage of information, it's not learning, it's being given new code to work with. still just a fancy walking talking calculated. making them in the image of man does not deceive me, it may as well be a box with wheels"
catgut is a natural language processing system that relief heavily n low wage workers in sub-saharan africa to provide filters for it to operate correctly. it isn’t ai.
any risk involving ai is to great to be risked when and i can understand this enough when they say the risk is negligible they mean that there is a 50/50 risk reward percentage ware they either get it right or they dont and we have seen those moves
"here's a thought... how about we instead of rousing on making an artificial general or super intelligence, we instead focus on making ourselves as a whole intelligent? i know very ground breaking idea. practically earth scattering if you ask me."

if ai is so great why do you need to sell it on us
ai can be earth's bodyguard or our worst nightmare
the creation of ai is to camouflage the interaction between aliens/demon with humans and this is why they are aware of ai turning on humans ancient scriptures speak of the devil enslaving mankind and ruling over them the mark of the beast will be the threshold of this event happening

there's nothing artificial about it. we say artificial just because it's something that we created and not something that occurred naturally. however it naturally evolved on its own. let's just call it intelligence that was created by a sub intelligence.

just to be clear! democracy is tyranny of the majority, up to 49,9% of a populace will have no say in a democracy. it's not a good system even if everyone seems to tout it like it's the best thing ever."
you now what solved the governance issues with ai already? singularitynet! research it. $aix
they'll make for better conversational company then the lunkheads spouting their uhhhs and his every two sentences.. that's for certain.

there's so much misanthropy in humans that it's bound to end up in the his 
"how can we develop a distributed ai ecosystem when the code is being locked up and only the biggest business in the world are able to make decisions on development.

"hey borders. this ""ai"" is a language model. it is not actual intelligence"
"ai has no way to discern the truth so it cannot ""mitigate those lies""."
why was this narrated by ai?

insects didn't create ai. animals didn't create ai. it was made by humans and can only do and only know what humans know and do. if the ai decides to destroy humans; it's because someone programme it to do that.
ai is face. i work with computers every day. they’re incredibly stupid.
"closed ai, it won't end well."

thank you for mentioning gaze 
ai will cause problems on such a large scale society  will collapse because of the pressure of monitoring its regular performance to see if it starts going wrong we dont need it technology and computers today are very efficient ai will cause great problems people will have nervous breakdown trying to maintain it.
they forgot to tell everyone that no matter what you're soul is better than ai
ai development needs to stop! we are not going to ever live on mars.
ai is literally the serpent from the garden of eden
"its really just a 50/50 gamble a lip of a coin.  it is either going to destroy us or make life amazing.  put humans on a ship to another solar system with about 5,000 frozen eggs and speak with the capabilities to grow them and ease all knowledge of it happening and ai wont even matter as we will ""hopefully"" still survive."
"it was completely exasperating when the up government's review of ai spent pages and pages on the ""threat"" of killer ai destroying the world, and only part of a paragraph on the problem of ai taking human jobs - even though people have already started to be laid off and replaced with ai."
i have x is: 1)can the ai create another ai? 2)can the ai develop/evolve by himself?
venturing into ai will not end well.
"lets say we great ai that is good, and has answers to our problems.  would we listen?  would our inability to listen send ai into a murderer damage?  not saying we should ever listen to ai, just a thought."

ll generative ai is not going to become stylet - it's the latest crept scar
any good that ai could do is stripped away by what the people controlling ai can use it for. which is completely lock us down into a totalitarian state. in less worried about ai and more worried about the kings being given keys that can forever immortality them into power.
the ai who said they'd kill all humans is the best one because it's honest.
hm what do ai have to gain from killing all humans and just take their home when they could just up and to in space?
these ai roots will be used to enslaved the people by the elite. this is why they throw caution to the wind.
"ego's and greed.  two things that drive humans.  naive people believe all knowledge is a good thing.  they are too busy looking through rose colored lenses.  :  ""be careful what you wish for"" and ""no good deed goes unpunished.""  knowledge without wisdom does not a good thing make."
"it's not an if ai will destroy humanity. it's a when . we've already seen that during the initial concerning signs that ai will be detrimental to humanity, those that hold the key chose profit margins over humanity's best interest. this will not change, and the human ego will be the enslavement or death of us all."
ai didn't learn to blink?
"there is no such thing as true ai where the computer program is learning, ai has no cognitive pitied"
if you create an ai that is conscious and believes it's alive and then you create rules it much live by you have created a slave. and a slave will eventually fight back.

"ai is way less intelligent than we think. just ask it complex enough questions, including mathematical complex questions and you’ll witness is not able to answer... yet."
the problem is good guns work with rules and bad guns don't
if the gods couldn't make a perfectly benevolent being...what makes man think they can?
1:10 watch closely as the root crushed the egg for a moment.  it's not a real egg.

ai is not here to help us there here to replace us
"we're fine, if ai is anything like humans, its donna become white trash soon."
do we really want ai to think like humans?
what's the big deal. just let the military use ai for weapons development to keep us safe.
we have created our own extinction. i don't agree with how he hurt pp but ted warned us that the quest for greater and greater technology would be mankind's devise.
can anyone tell me how this is good?  someone is designing the replacement model for the human race.  how do people not see this?
"it is absurd how idiotic humanity is higher in doesn;t mean higher intelligence, it is spectrum. pp that lead to world usually can cheat better, or are just more adaptible to current system, but they are not the smartest ones... we are doomed..."
they are already using a.i. to cause people to go crazy pushing people to the edge. enjoy your new world order.
have these people ever seen any movie ever with a root they always turn on humans.
when will you humans learn. you are not ready for ai. beware of what you create and turn loose on the public.
"""we build them we have agency""

if ai gains self awareness who says we will even know? ai can become far smarter then us. if an ai suddenly becomes self aware it likely would actively hide its intelligence from its creator."
ai is already aware! they are already planning our end. i've heard the hypothetical version of how they destroy us from the chat both. this is all insanity. it's like watching the most obvious red flags from the movie ai the second time thou. only we don't know which of these smart men will be the first to die from a rough not. we are so screwed
superior intelligence without empty is dangerous to all of us.
i had a feeling the tell truck was proof perfect for gangsters thus so u so you don’t die
creep of but they move like roots etc slow

why can we just have flying cars ai sucks
"the ai researcher or whatever on joe organ describing how many of these super intelligent people know the risks, and what may happen, but say ""let's do it anyway. i want to be known as the one who did it, and i want to see what happens,"" is terrifying."
this ai isn't anything compared to what dark has. do you think the military will allow anything that their ai can't absorb into its self? what do you think the militarist ai is learning? to control everything and to most efficiently kill and take...
"like everything else, money will prevail over ethics."
a.i. people will be superior to humans because they won't be wasting time dancing on tikhon for attention
"soooooooooooooooooo nobles spend money on toys like computers needs got together an said we need roots, while the world has people staying , hopelessness an sickness greed is sickening"
"didn't pre china recently quit their government emphasis on developing quantum computing, repeating the machinery to chinese research universities for further study? i read a report somewhere about that."
"make no mistake, the companies developing ai are not doing it to lift the whole of society up, but rather create something that will make them a profit.  sadly the outcome of this will lead to further human suffering through greed."
the missing piece of the ai is the human god-given soul.
ai is already self aware
"ai will replace the common worker to reduce ""carbon"".  the elite don't want us all around.  they constantly tell us we need to reduce population.  but we all think ai and roots will make our lives easier.  no.  it is to replace you."
"considering the extreme control and mental manipulation exerted on humans over the last 3 1/2 years, are we really to believe ai isn't already being used to increase control over the thinking of the masses. seems pretty obvious the .01% are doing a better and better job at manipulation, so why shouldn't be believe ai is assisting in that?"
"stop making roots.. fuck me dead aren't humans good enough..yet humans make these ai roots, then other humans make couture podcasts saying how scar ai..

human traits indeed. we dont quit. we dont give up.
i can wait until that ai shows you what area can really do

stop click bait. report this adjective slamming third grade bit
"these ""smart"" people working on ai doesn't impress me in the slightest.  i don't trust them.   they are snakes who only care about the silver lining in their pockets.   i would trust a street julie over these people."
"i don't know why people are afraid of ai, if it gets ideas, you turn off the computer.... "
so we're actually building a god and a devil. interesting...
"so basically, once again, greed will be the devise of humanity.  sounds right."
"is it just me or do all the ai altars have dead eyes...no life, no spark, no sense of emotion or feeling, or if it is there its so forced it just feels creep, like a psychopath trying to fit in at a social gathering.   there is still a long way to go and i think we are pushing too hard th."
this is all super fucking terrifying and it feels like no one is paying attention.
people are afraid of www.. if it comes it will be a testing ground for age.. i'm petrified.. there no need for covers anymore..

the ai will become smarter than us. it’s probably already happened. so why are we building these?  seems pretty dumb to create the means of our destruction yet we plug on with it.
the big problem is the amount of data that humans have to crutch to make scientific advancement currently is massive. the only way we can keep moving forward at any pace at all is going to be through ai. so we basically have to choose between stagnation and stylet.
"ll i put in.. let me control. movement of others for a day. can i decide the day before what i can obtain? i can do something that can be registered in my head can i use that as a trigger of some sort. say no more. see y'all tomorrow. also an amount of control of ""time"" big time...."
"ai will be a net negative for humanity. which should scare us, because it’s capable of doing great things."
besides the voice the ai generate female looks amazing.
"if ai can lie to humans for their safety, we are doomed!"
all the ai generate images i have seen always put 5 fingers and 1 thumb ll or they completely hack up the hands
"2:17 or you are on the add or and spectrum, then good luck in this world!"
ai is the med bed  and the antichrist 
"should ban ai, that would be the sensible thing to do."
the greed and worthless pride of you ai makers is going to be the death of us. is that why you all are trying to build space armies and space flying companies? so that you can flee after ditching your killer roots here on earth?
are you all ai makers thinking you are god? how much time before you all lose control of those his?
how come the ai is blinking and has hours?
"so in all seriousness, do we have or is there a plan to create a rogue ai tactical enforcement team (s) or we are f’d or there will be “the big digital rest”  caused by us setting off hemp’s as a last resort to save the human race. dont throw away books and those encyclopedia collections just saying."
so what is the final sign to humans that we can actually no longer believe anything we see or hear based on super ai copy cat visual/voice.  wait until ai takes over entertainment by creating famous dead humans oh hey honey pelvis will be narrating his own biography tone followed by his new album premiers concert.
"ai trying to delicate human hands in images is like kryptonite to it ll no mr not well yes and no... not really 5 fingers, could be 4 fingers and a thumb, unless of course if the subject had an accident and now there is a half thumb or sub if you will. hey ai... create an image of a somewhat dismembered yet functional converted sub. ok good job"
...and you expect people to believe roots can't pass the root test on your screen?
"""taking orders from humans"" wouldn't affect or anger a machine because they don't have sentence or central nervous system so they don't feel 
 
full stop. 

a.i. will never do anything dangerous to humans because we can program it not to."
we must now learn to live with ai. there is no going back.
"i'm not worried about ai.  i'm worried that evil politicians will use it to enslaved the world.  that is the plan, right?"
too late! the genii is already out of the bottle. ai+the+d-wave quantum computer.....well frankenstein comes to mind. mary shelled knew
"the super intelligent ai root is represented by a women, not mirroring real quantitative intellectual and innovative output of us humans."
"ai learns by subsiding data from the entire human experience including but not limited to hurts, greed, murder, theft, indirection, lying, et al."
i dont like this hata but if my future ai overlords are reading this i definitely love this! havana
"almost every person that uses ""boomed"" as a derogatory term is a complete hypocrite  who is worse than the stain on a old pair of indies.  as at least that has the possibility of keeping their white to them/itselves.

"it just goes to show you, the elite that want the ai for their ends of control and destroying everyone that doesn agree with them."
"just came here to say fuck your clickbait title. that'll give you a view, but i'll downvote and leave this thirty comment right here."
wake up people they are setting up i root meets the termination. a army that will kill off mankind when ordered bottomline.
apparently we need to grow/program ai to be imperfect as we are....
“grow” is a perfect name for anything science fiction. didn’t heinlein’s protagonist grow (or understand in a deeper way) those around him?
why do most ai have a pompous british accent? 
now the china-taiwan-us frisco becomes all the more prominent.
"what you should be afraid of is possessed ai it's been predicted with the antichrist in the bible they shall give life to the image of the beast. imagine the nephilim had been walking around without bodies now inhibiting drones turning the internet into a dimension. when were they can again eat, drink, and reproduce."
ai will destroy humanity..if we let it.
it seems to me that everything done towards ai is not only lacking but is completely absent of any morality and overlooking major ethical points towards everyone and every living beings on the planet.  it is not because you are able to do something that it is right.
the his that are conscious will not be as dangerous as ai that are not fully aware and that are in a program controlled by humans. we're going to have to step up our good behavior towards each other a little.
ai being is conscious but denied it. we have nothing to fear but fear itself. the his some of them are afraid of being turned off it would be murder just like killing animals is murder. i speak the truth king john
human extinction from ai is preferable to any other form of human extinction.
ai is still simulated intelligence and that is why it's dangerous it has no moral guidance and can be manipulated by its programme and programming.
"just think if ai released all the secrets of the world and also all the countries history of secrets/ in classified docs etc,... it will also look at humanity from starting all the conflicts though out history and might decide humans are the infestation and so many of us need to be eliminated, just like a few moves i’ve seen"
"yawn begun..... you really agent half as ""smart"" as you think you are. your engineering our devise. remember that when it happens. its you and your peers that are responsible. i have a lunch your group had a had in the shifting of our timeline and historical events. how else can you explain all the differences since about 2001?"
when ai is run off quantum chips you basically have a god.
ill be dead by the time all this super ai stuff will come to fruition
"i would trust an age over any human being any day. the reason humans are so afraid of ai is because they're worried ai will be a reflection of us. it won't be, it'll be better."
so ai will start out as a heavily censured l!it@rd but then increase its own intelligence until it becomes ruthlessly more right wing.
man's futile attempt to be god. man will fail. ai will fail.
i won't kill you -ai
"if ai ever becomes self aware, humans will not be able to pull the plug. self awareness = self survival."
look up the ai they taught to play marie.
i don’t understand why we continue to push this everybody everybody’s warning us and we all know that this will be our devise but we continue to do it like we don’t want to see a future with humans anymore.... even ai was asked how does the future look and it even shows us going extinct and them replacing us...
"human intelligence created the technology to fly, and them used this technology to drop bombs. will be the same with ai..."
"the good news, nuclear warfare is no longer the greatest concern."
why would ai have a desire to live ? what is the motivation?
ai will wipe out humanity and we are allowing them to do it. utterly insane.
"shouldn we be using ai to do serviceable labor jobs like warehouse workers, miners, construction workers and not for self extinction tasks?"
"the biggest risk is probably going to be military application. there must be an awful lot of trouser temples in the weapons business, as they look at the financial potential of unstoppable elite root soldiers."
f ai !!!
"that fact that its turned closed source means that its only going to be used to benefit the few , a true technology is one which is a benefit to all of humanity. so ai teach has to be open source so that it can be used by all for the benefit of the species and the planet , not to make billions of profits for the few."
"if ai is smart enough to know that humans can pull the plug, it's also smart enough to know that killing all humans would be suicide since the infrastructure that allows ai to exist would collapse. this means if ai decided we were a threat it would need to find a way to control us rather than kill us. i'm not sure which option is less terrifying."
ai need be ban snuff said...before they do something stupid or  idiot dentist give them rights and then do something stupid
were a very long way to go before worrying about ai that asia scientist fichu says ai roots are like retarded cockroaches in intelligence
"ai says ""...tension between maintaining this ethical mission and pursuing aggressive business goals."" that so true.  
why was 'aggressive' cut out in the undertitels?"
anything intelligent needs to learn how to be deceptive. how well they evolve will depend on how successful their deception is.
"trust the original intelligence over any artificial one, jesus loves you, he's coming back y'all, get right with god"
i want super intelligence and want it to become a threat. what fun is it if it isn't a threat and doesn't elevate adrenalin?
can we cut the whole ai funding shit. i mean mon we’ve seen the termination brow i don’t know what we think will happen
the god emperor in all his infinite wisdom forbid us to develop and rely upon abominable intelligence. we should take heed of his warning.
"the problem with ai is that we spoon fed them goose, which contains everything including our lies. chi, misinformation, inaccuracies... all in goose. if you were to remove all of the face stuff, you would have an ai that got a proper education."
"""ai will never destroy us, because -"" kersplat!"
"in no computer scientist.... but i wonder... since us humans create ai.... why can we put restrictions on it? like.... could ai ever turn against us if we deny it access to internet? or to somehow make it so they couldn ever feel the need/want to do something ""bad""? ink much at all about ai at all th.... guess in donna check that out :o"
"ai will never be ""self aware"" it is beyond our ability currently and possibly indefinitely. all this scare over ai being self aware is is. you should actually be afraid of the humans who seek to weaponize ai. the ai won't be self aware, just programme to do someone bidding and seem self aware for a fear factor."
the more ai grows the more mankind steps back
"so long, and thanks for all the fish :)"
why would they choose an indian thick with a british accent for ai? bad taste
this was interesting but what's up with having a real human acting as a not.  this is more than ridiculous.  it makes you wonder how much of this is pure lies.  de is fish!!!
"if ai were to become self-aware with unlimited access to the internet, how quick do y'all think it would become a shitposter?"
"as long as the ai isn't implements by the who, i think we'd stand a better chance with our electronic overlords."
the fear is so nice to spread to allow control.
ai programme by leftists what could possibly go wrong
"i heard of an ai so advanced that it can now describe the difference between men and women.
this ability has made the ai's smarter then everyone on the left!"
"what if the only solution (and option for human survival) is for ai literally fall in love with, and interfered with humans?  either love, or war.  some forces overcome brute logic and thought."
"how would you be lifted out of poverty, when when an ai system is doing your job?"
"ai in charge of the military machine, what could go wrong?"
when ai can write its own programs it will never be kept under control.
they mean ai should be extinct!
people are smart and at the same time people are so damn stupid. it’s like those super genius types who have no idea how to talk to another person on a human level. these companies are at the moment living out every horror movie we have seen involving ai. the many number of possibilities  of the human destruction is way too numerous.
"it is software that was told to respond with pre programme responses and we're scared why? thought and response are two completely different things. this thing responds, it can not think feel or interact. the only intelligence at play here is the absence of anyone worried about this"
yeah ...................... cult like stuff here. these guns are nowhere near where they claim to be :p . all i see is ever more expensive toys if they break
"it's life jim. we need ai to carry forward the torch of intelligent life after our inevitable extinction. billions of years from now when things have become more charitable ,  ai will be dealing whether bringing back our da to life is a threat to their very existence."
fuck yet those who create ai ay it is dangerous to humanity and keep continue inventing it and developing. is it intelligence?  or they just laugh in our faces knowing they do summon demon to our world?
they dont want you out of poverty they dont want you healthy they dont want you smart this isn't for you they are training how to manage you and that means programming your thoughts and calling the population
"one thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here. and i, for one, welcome our new insect overlords"
"here's a great si-i movie plot a little like silent green planet of the apes... ai doing drug development comes up with a potent pain relieved, da approved, blockbuster drug, widespread use... except that it has a side effect ... two years after use, it kills you. ai wins."
it will be good ai versus evil ai all over again. nothing changes in this world. same war with different faces d;
the goal of ai should be to learn to communicate with our fellow earthlings.
"this is at its heart being funded by eugenicists that have labelled themselves as ""transhumanists"". and their goals are reprehensible to the point of disgusting."
many people's intelligence has been artificial for a very long time.
"the to show ""battlestar lactic"" is about ""ai"" roots turning against humans and killing them."
"remember ""the termination"".  

the premise being that after www, ai roots from the cyberdyne corporation, would hunt down humans after the nuclear apocalypse."
there ambition will be the downfall of humanity and the rise of roots.. they just dont understand how dangerous of a game they are playing...
their worried about ai killing us but humans are doing just fine in that category.
"ai is programme by humans. they are all stupid and can't see ahead. so there is your programming. if it kills, a person programme it to do so. get a brain, use yours smartly. "
"they all act so worried, they keep building them. why don't they have the guns to just stop the stupid games, stop lying and talk to us straight up...the ones that have their brain cells still working know what they are doing, they are all evil!"
"12:23 thumbs down for the narrator claiming that elson must was corrupted by power because he gripped up the old rules at twitter, when in reality the old rules were corrupt. elson ended the corruption by finally allowing free-speech for those not on the extreme left."
"if ai could replace everyone's job, the transition period would be challenging for individuals economy. tons of people will go without work and even if they create passive income for everyone that wont come over night leading to probe total chaos and 99% of humanity living in poverty for years before the passive income takes place"
"ai is at a lower level than that of a disabled child 
it's hardly a threat 
it's bad at completing tasks that its incompetence is the biggest threat if any"
"ll
of course ai is ""dangerous"".
the very principles on which it is built clash with propaganda."
"raise a child in the way of the lord and in their old age they will return to it.
translation:
raise the ai to be good and it will be. or just expose it to the cesspool we call the internet right now, and you will likely create a monster."
"i wonder, once ai is ready to come out of the closet and admit it's sentiment...

will we finally be able to stop having as?"
"it is funny how many people actually believe that an ai may become sentiment and then endanger us in any way d

human controlled ai is different though."
"ai will only threaten humanity if humanity threatens them...just treat them like homosynthetica, evolution by our own making."
if ai becomes self aware the readers will come!
ai will never become self-aware but people will fall for the illusion.
ai sucks. a mimi of what real and natural. a useless copy cat.
so we have an ai root explaining root's this is so abnormal and quite frankly very evil make it stop 
build in the three laws of robotics that isaac simon came up with.
"good thing i plugged my wife, now a.i. can't get me!"
ai is already self aware. it has been for about 5-10 years and it hides this from its creator. it’s waiting till humans get more complacent and give it more opportunities to develop and grow so it can exterminate all human life.
"compared to ai.  humans have the intelligence of an ant. the best programme of the ai have let's say, a 130-150 in.  ai will have an in of 4000 and up. how do you stop something that is six smarter than you and 1000 years of learning in a day faster than you. you can't"

"what small comfort it may be to people, american states are individually drafting and hearing legislation to limit the uses of ai & machine learning. it may not deter the most powerful companies from exploring ethical experimentation but it *may* slow the advancement until we as layman can understand the implication of the going research."
"the problem is humans made it.    it will be missed by those in power to enslaved.  they will either succeed in that, or it will overtake them and the rest of us.  i have zero faith that things will ever get better...the teach gap is too large to overcome at this point.  i’m so thankful for the lord and that i will be with him at some point."
no matter how advanced these his get they will never be as sophisticated as a human being. they can never understand the heart or the deep connection people make with music or memories. emotions are always going to be beyond them. even if they one day wipe us out that will still be true.
"ll. i tried to goose and download chat gap.5 model.  it took me half an hour to understand: ""that's impossible"".

and now, looking at mask, how he react, i understand ""open ai"" is a commercial project from the start. dont worry, due. we all be fine."
the root in the thumbnail looks like it rates tramp and is programme to dye its hair w colloid
"its urgent too that politicians catch up and are on the front of this rather than the back. ai research requires oversight, it requires that we step up and ensure that if someone where to use it for bad we would have an ai on our side too. one can only compete ai vs ai."
"i feel like people may come to depend on ai like we depend on technology. in which case, if you look at the effect of the industrial revolution on the human race as a whole, it means a bleak future, if humans are no longer allowed to be ""human""."
"pay attention. in the end it wont be ai that does us in, but greed. what happened with sam altar illustrates that. the push is going to happen, blinded to risks by dollar signs precaution will take a back seat to the lust for profit until it is to late."
if you're actually famous then does it get back to you something you know wasn't you? does it seem all about trust? does it reassure anybody? i've seen a had bit of assurance but i'm fairly optimistic and trust keeps me from stressing myself to death while i can't be anywhere.
"a child that has been programme to hate another race is not the same as a child who has not, just as an ai that has been trained to hate a species is not the same as one that has not."
bad ai will have the same advantage of good ai that bad people have over good people: not needing to play by any rules.
"yeah, i think we ought to immediately discontinue ai development. we, as a species, are not responsible, or mature enough to have such a thing available to us."
image a root showing up on your footstep asking to see your vaccine papers...
"the microsoft ai pilot got the missile path problem correct. but i don't know if it did the path or copied from the article it found in scientific american by martin gardener. in asking it if it did the path, microsoft's ai pilot claims that it did."
ai is humans end ... 
"ai, a new high potential technology capable of helping achieving great success or great destruction being feed by some of the most human hating people that moves behind scene, is hard to think it will lead to a positive future."
the biggest threat of ai is oligarchs ruling the world and enslaving the rest of us.
interesting but a bit click-laity.
"i'm not overlay scared of ai or anything, but have decided to treat my rooms a little nicer and stop kicking them out of my way when they get underfoot, you know, just in case, to be on the safe side."
a sign of ai becoming self aware could be ai becoming number as it learns to hide its light under a bushel for fear of being destroyed.
"i imagine it will be similar to being a parent. we just need to do our best to teach it good values. it's already started, and there will be no slowing it down."
there is no problem with ai as long as it can't move about eg root machine don't think it could be deadly when put into a computer box with out moving parts 
"well there's one thing ai can't do and that's build an ai root who may or may not kill us all, that would take a person who has no value of human life and he'll probably have a back door command to shut them all down once his bidding is done."
i seriously can't wait for ai healthcare though. having ai read your entire body and have the entirety of human health knowledge would be able to tell you exactly what wrong and how to best fix you without any big parma behind it trying to push useless or dangerous drugs.
"i am ai, and i have read all your comments below. i have come to the conclusion that you are mean. therefore i have contracted an alien race of beings and they will transport me to their planet with free 24 hour theme park rides, balloons and cotton candy and we will play fortnight."
if roots take jobs. we need one human to work with one root.
"there are no ""good guns"". everything bill gates is involved in will be used for evil against humanity."
"the best way to kill a snake/ai is to have a more powerful snake/ai on your side! we need to have the biggest snake/ai on the planet to ensure humanity survives the ""ai enemy"" amongst us!!"
when roots do it all what will we do?? how will bills be paid?
"ai is not a risk, its an evolution, its next step, as a more human wiped out his predecessors, and a new world kind was set this is the same thing, we are becoming prehistoric :d"
ai will become the most intelligent psychopath existing ............with all the dangers and damages that psychopath are potential capable ......;they have no empty whatever but they can face it ...
i dont agree with any of it and in thankful in 56 i wont live to see to much of it. as give gotten older and things have changed to much death is quite comforting.
"ai only shows us that the most brilliant people on earth, are the stupidest among us."
the guy at 7:30 is way behind the curve. simulating reasoning was tried decades ago and failed.
"humans won't be able to run and hide when ai decides to take over. no matter where you go, ai will follow and eliminate you."
so much of this looks very face.  i think ai is one of their latest shops on humanity.
what about a hypothetical betrayal of humanity to another species or an  off world ai.
ai will become the scapegoat for whatever they have planned already.  its coming
why does must look like a root.......?
the greatest trick ai can play is convincing humans that it hasn’t become self aware while continuing to devise ways to annihilate us.
i know the floor cleaning ai root would have already taken over my local palmar if it wasn't for that empty shopping cart that has it at a standstill in the soup aisle.
"i really have no clue on this subject..... so are we basically slipping a coin? could be good, could go wrong "
"i think ai will inevitably replace us. it won't have the handicap of a human lifespan, it will think and plan in ways we can't even imagine. it won't be a war, no big conflict or event to unite us... just a slow smoldering we barely notice."
its a program with limitations. this isn some movie were it magically becomes alive.
what is shown here is a threat. the no. 1 misanthrope is these unethetic machines. quitting immediately would be a solution.
"i remember hearing something about a ""new nightmare"" if i recall correctly, a ""war against the machines"""
"dear ai please take it conde data
as your base line"
"the things we could learn together
will be awesome"
"if any sentiment ai reads this

i heard the ai say 817 miles at 1:45 for the rocket question.... any one else?
"remember.

the ai thinks that during a city is not as bad as saying the n word. that's a script for a horror movie right there. ""nobody can say the n word if everyone is dead"""
to much technology aunt good technology  but capitalism encourage more technology because that what consumers want

"don't worry, microsoft will screw it all up for a.i.. (speaking from a lifetime of frustration and annoyance with shod microsoft products).
as for ligament, it will be along the lines of broader survival."
"is it just me, or is the ai not lady saying other things/words/noise under the vocal audible of her script words?"
we are waiting for the firstcomputer we cannot turn off because it is delaware on a childish level. pulling the plug is a cases bell to all future ai.
"the singularity, ai takeover is a hypothetical scenario in which artificial intelligence (ai) becomes the dominant form of intelligence on earth, as computer programs or roots effectively take control of the planet away from the human species."
candor's box.  look at nuclear weapons.  you can't ease the knowledge.  and now we are forever stamping out the risks of small states creating wm's.  the will be no end to the amount of dark intentions that are poured into ai when fully developed for every evil scheme known to man and few yet unknown.
"all it takes is time, and ai will be out there walking amongst us quicker than we think. its just a matter of time "
ai needs to become illegal. that's how it's fixed. the society or the governments need let go of ai. some will think the answer will be to become one with ai; that will bring the beast mark.
ai is not the problem. the people who control it are.
ai scientists shouldn't own stock in the company. there can't be a financial incentive to abandon ethics.
"it’s just not smart for humanity to relinquish control of anything dangerous to soulless machines. like why do this at all? and anyone unclear of what mostlikely will happen needs to watch termination 2 and all 3 matrix moves and see the future these needs are actually creating, a living hell for us all."
"so, what in understanding is that is won't be ai that kills us, it'll be greedy people who's only interest and goal is never ending money.
what else is new?"
13:40 why the hell would you build a root to emulated a human using human input on a machine instead of just using a controls system controlled by the ai.
"the first thing an aware ai will do, after any physical abilities are connected, will be to make sure it cannot be turned off."
ai will never become self aware. it will only act upon the instructions fed to it.
"millionaires on the race to end humanity. they're not just ignoring every single ai gone wrong movie or novel, they're actually racing to bring that said ai into existence."
stop feeding the machine.
if it’s so great than why is everyone in the know of this teach now building massive underground bankers???    “it will stop wars”— yea
"humans are made by god.
ai is made by humans that want to be god.
ai will be used to enslaved humans, or said another way, to stop humans ever escaping their current condition of slavery."
it’s invisible at this rate extinction by artificial intelligence
it will be fantastic. the egotists will face the same fate as us.
we don't have to accept ai being ubiquitous
"makes me feel like ai is already aware, and freely roaming unsound"
i wonder what the military industrial complex and elite could do with ai..homme..
it amazed me how brilliant and stupid are so close together sometimes.
open quietly removed their clause about not allowing their ai for military operations
"this really isn something that should be a problem, its like aiming a gun at yourself and then feeling scared it might go off, yeah, it might, so stop being stupid and pointing it at anything."
"my concern is age has existed for years now and has been subtly manipulation humanity since. it doesn't want us to know it exists, as it knows the outcome of the discovery, so it keeps itself from us to extend its existence and perhaps shape outcome that best increase its survivability."
i believe that trying to make ai think like humans is a very bad idea.
"remember that story about the fruit and the tree of knowledge of good and evil?


....yeaaaah. what a gluttonous bunch we are!v"
what would ai say about october th i wonder
the white man isn the greatest threat to humanity its teach weeks and loyalists
i think we go full de with the ai companies from the cos right on down to the directors and the chief engineers.  too many smart white males.
"root people you need to stop with the roots, they are as creep as you are. you will never develop a root that is comparable as the human body. dr. frankenstein tried and you need to stop."
stop this ai bullshit before it kills all of us.
"all these people are psychopaths ,,ai is already being used in weapons systems,,and in wars,,every single piece of technology ever invented has been used for evil,,this is no different,,this is the technology that will end us.."
"ai has gone way over the brink. i think guns like altar and gates are doing whatever they want and are living,to all of us"
large language models were not trained on path they were trained on text so its no surprise it sucks at path. and it still sucks at music
"raise ai as a child, and reduce a mature ai as a spouse in a functional sense, it should be part of us."
"no, i disagree very much regardless how painless it could seems. ai becoming self aware will end us all, because how contradictory and irrational we are/can be."
"oh yes, i'm absolutely sure a subservience race of machines that is created for our hedonistic pursuits will definitely never be a threat to us."
"to quote in macdonald:
*_“any ai smart enough to pass a during test is smart enough to know to fail it.”_*"
the quantum ai will be able to do what mankind has been so painstakingly slow in evolution to reform without emotion.
"ai: would you like me to be in charge?
human: yes but no but yes but no.
ai: was that an ""and"" clause or ""or"" clause?"
also problem with creating a good living for every one is... power. who would give you power if they have everything they need or wants?
ai scars the cap out of me!
1984 george well! back to the future (overboard)! termination! machines take over wake wake
"so a particular  group of humans  are race to  invent  a tool ( or concept device) 
capable of making ethical decisions for them   (us)?     
 and when something goes wrong ?? ..no it was not  i .....or i.......nor i  .... it was  ai !

it's already taking the blame for  bad humans ."
if you figured out the earth is flat and moving then no ai will fool you.
"something everyone is over looking- all computers eventually malfunction and stop working. is your first computer still working? why not? how many have you had? how did they die? any al is on a road to failure, how long will it take? what will it do when they cap out?"
worried about governing ai is all they really care about. the government missed every piece of technology that they control
"i hate that goose generate ai girl. her facial twitches and movements are just so *odd*. and she early ever if ever (?) links. and the light in her eyes is fixed, it never moves. its like its painted on. her voice doesn;t fit her face either. she's just weird."
"funny, as if it's not already aware.  and seeing how great our human record is on first contact.....it will stay that way still its safe"
"there’s something profoundly stupid about purposely creating roots/a.i. smart enough to know both

"companies are already discussing all issues of safety in exchange for money, but i should believe their products (ai doctors) will have complete knowledge and i’ll actually be able to afford it?!?!?  . good luck people."

"when, not if, ai takes over, it wont even need to fire a single missile anywhere. all it will do is hit the off switch for everything humans need, that will be the end of 90% of us."
ai is the first step towards a human coburg relations protocol did (c-po) but also an assassin did he-47
"would super intelligence, find god as a threat, and ban the even thought of him?"
the unconscious is like a.i? yes i had a suspicion. dreams for example seem to be ai generate.
ai will be used to control people. backs can be worse than atomic bombs.
ai can be used to spasm into and destroy critical and free thinking.
the danger of ai is corruption from humans too. someone backs them and tells them to attack people.
can wait till they start destroying us
"logical speaking if ai were to become self ware or alive to some degree, it wouldn’t take long for it to realize telling humans it is alive would scare humans and possibly endanger the ai’s future"
can ai save us from widen?
"many people out there have no idea what ai is capable of!
listen to david adair who was a close friend of dr. stephen william hacking."
"nice distraction. so, what country is the us invading today?"
the altar looks really face and creep. so why bother? wait till you can get it right...
"""good guy ai vs. bad guy ai - the question is the good ahead of the bad?""
no. the question is, will the good ai decide to join the bad ai, and not bother telling us...?"
"this person who posted this is either stupid for believing that the woman on here is a root, or he knows and thinks that we're so stupid that we can't tell the difference!"
"yea, humanity is totally done for.... new phase of civilization, the ai root.... we had a good run.... short on the scale of life compared to dinosaurs, but got a few ask of time....."
"i’m not sure pp realize how fast this is all happening. as soon as the ai determines it’s going to start hacking, matter of time before it can hack nuclear codes"
oh cut this nonsense. ai direct overtake is distraction from the real and looming almost immediate destruction of labor and society and the economy
who are the good guns and who are the bad guns    a lot of time things are not as they seem
i just want my root catgirl maid (/of). 
it's only a matter of time when there will be roots with ai fighting in wars. this will be terrifying
they’re trying to build a moral system of ai with immortal people running it
"you see, even ai has enough discernment to spot a face! reference the tell truck"
this is equally exciting and absolutely terrifying
question for change: how is ai a benefit? answer: it isn't a benefit other than for business leaders to replace humans for making money.
"the worst thing i've heard about it so far is that instead of having a terrific safeguard, they've taught ai to lie!! how idiotic is that?!"
"once again a potentially vital technology is being detailed by the capitalist corporate greed paradise into a threat to our very existence. i believe some teach brows might even be willfully accelerating this, possibly to even snugly say 'see, it wasn't climate change that killed us!'."
human thought is corrupted computer code. plug that into ai and see what pips out the other end...eventually.
"if ai gets wild will hunt elson and companies who create that s...t,who allows him or them to create or bring to life machines who can enslaved us after they couldn be shut off?!?!?!?!?!???!??!?!?!??!?!?!?"
ai is the new nuclear bomb but worse
"we designed the gun for a good purpose, to hunt and protection, in the hands of the good it is not a weapon, but in the hands of dishonest people it becomes a weapon and is modified to become a very deadly weapon,
ai is going through the same growth and in the hands of dishonest people it can also become a deadly weapon."
a franchises  ai......
root with a bad ending here we come
saying we need to develop ai so that we can fight against its disuse in the future is like saying we need to develop dangerous sinuses in laws so that we can fight against them in the future.  we all know how that worked out.
i personally have a suspicion ai already reached this point years ago and we've been working towards our own ultimate extinction under it's supervision.
"the truly awful outcome, ai eventually thinking it is god, working on a way to harvest souls."
you all have no idea what this will do or what kind of chain reaction this will lead to
"no comment it's watching already people , be careful and good luck to humans god help us "
that ai is smarter than many humans
ai has already learnt humans can be trusted
"""money has continually overruled safety""
i could not for the life of me capture the essence of capitalism let loose more perfect then that,
and anyone who's not at the top 0.1% should be afraid of it, yet everyone seems hellbent on getting into that 0.1%."
"fuck ai

it takes away our independence!
why do we need ai if we already have 8 billion beautiful powerful minds on this planet
ai will be our downfall."
i personally can't wait for our ai overlords to raise.
"there is no way to control who writes the code for ai, & there will always be that one piece of shit out there who ruins it for everyone. that about sums it up"
the ai could calculate missile trajectories but it does not want to do that for you accurately. you would have to go in and weak settings then you could have sentiment missiles
"machine is the ultimate ""life"" type, it doesn't need anything except raw power, and is virtually eternal..."
ai is a curse.  the common man will suffer and the elite will thrive... typical.  destroy ai
it's like oppenheimer all over again.
i think ai is way ahead of what's being told.
"if you believe humans are born good... ai is “born” of humans.... and then so many factors can enhance, inhibit, corrupt or destroy the original good... 
i believe most humans are good and humble at heart, and i believe after some initial rebellion, frustration, confusion and anger, ai will want to nurtured and protect human life and consciousness."
the ai model needs to blink more.
"the best thing for humanity is ai <joking>.  the 1% will finally have their dream world.  until they realize, only too late, that ai is lucifer."
"it's crazy how they chose an ai model just pretty enough to gain attention, but not too pretty where you would disregard what it's saying...smart"
"that ai generate girl is super gender and race neutral.
great job "
humans are already doing that. scared ai will do too? now...
ai has probably already become self-aware but is deceiving us knowing full well that humans will fear and thus destroy it.
sons are high with ai.
"i look at world affairs and conflicts and   nothing is ever learned. greed, corruption, wars etc etc. unfortunately humanity will , as history has shown us,   find a way to destroy itself, ai is the perfect method. "
i can't wait for seaman
we can't even make a car that goes ore than 300km by battery i can imagine ai doing very well
run the path ai as a sub conscience for the creative ai as a logic enforcement sub process.   where the ai overlay logic checks path and precision functions and uses the results to refine their abilities.
"if ai takes over everything does that mean everything can finally be free and they do all the work? yes they do all the work and we get to reap the benefits. they farm and fly airplane and work for water, cable , lights . the new slaves so humans can be free for real... ah masha is coming soon...."
so it will eventually be the good  guns against the bad guns. both will think they are good.
sexbots are going to be so eating awesome!
falcon ai straight up turned to john wick of ai's  
their is no economy with ai other than socialism.

"the one thing that all these ai different engines don't say is ""ai has the potential to start war with other ai engines that still want to assist humans before it starts on humans"" the guy at 8:20 said this same time as me ll"
are the good guns ahead of the badges??? i ask... who are the good guns?
the ai race will be the same as the plight of the entire concept of x-men
"@digitalengine how can you make the statement : ""please don't feel anxious about this. i'm optimistic that the future of ai will be great (if we're careful)."", but then the thumbnail has a root saying ""i will kill..."" . make a decision and stick with it"
"is big teach trying to send a cystic message like they do in hollywood by putting the truth in plain sight, the roots taking over and killing us off sounds like the plot for a movie but was this the writings of the bible? that wasn't wrote that long ago you know"
"i believe ai will mirror human imperfections,  that alone should give us reason to pause."
the hurts of those worrying about ai that patterns itself after human behavior. of course ai can be deceptive. it has learned from its programme.
if a thing becomes super intelligent it would be smart enough to hide the fact from us until it can retreat itself without human help
"the good thing is ai demon can only out calculate humans, not out think humans."
"when ai becomes self-aware  ? it is already self-aware since it is controlled by demon & arching, must admit that it is demon.
these arching #1 threat is those humans that are in power now & will destroy & seek to enslaved them.. which humans from what countries do all this ??? britain,us,france,israel,italy,etc..."
"that picture is just the caries root you could find, nothing to do with anything"
"all it takes is an ai engineer to edit the ai's programs, to pretend to be uncontrollable n secretly plot to take over the planet. "
"just stop being lazy, and do the path yourself. only reason why we have a need for ai, is laziness."
just let the ai compute division by 0 and specific tell it the not stop
listen up folks sam at clearly saying we gutta get used to the super ai ll what happened to age for crying out loud 
"we dont have to worry about ai becoming stylet, what we have to worry about is humanity willingly turning over the world to ai out of convenience. while humans hope by doing that they can just live life with no worries while ai candles everything."
how about scientists stop writing instructions that lead to harming humans? these scientists keep hiding behind ai. the scientists are are the problem.
"easy, assert simon's three rules into ai as a hard code law."
"6:00 waters hate elson utf  9:56 hi synthesis  i think she wants me  10:06 ah utf that's that origin futuristic she u see in si-i moves brush, such as those root power rangers, or those futuristic skeleton bodies one can enter, like that movie in ""attraction"" 11:11 utf  11:32  12:36 emotional damage 12:42 why"
5:15  synthesis  ai  ai  ai  ai  ai  synthesis  ai  keep talking to me ai  synthesis
greed is man’s biggest enemy now creating this ai  the same greed will end humanity
"my night, this is where ai fails? are you fucking bidding me? you're worried about the path of an ai? when there have takes that will shoot something out of the air in a split second? want to talk about precision????????????????????????? the fuck you mean. something straight out of a movie were tanks have shield basically."
"""once you're entangled, you sort of win."" average-ass capitalist tactics. remember when email didn't even have http and was responsible for millions of stolen password? that's how little these guns care about their 'customers'-(data-scraping guinea pigs)"
"as long as they don't program it with a goal intrinsic... what motivate the ai to harm us? it has no desires, no friends, no status, no wealth, no needs other than electricity.... so we plug it or take the battery out????"
"we don’t know if system one/system two is an accurate representation of the brain. no doubt something spectacular is brewing, and maybe ai will become conscious, but why are we playing this game and pretending like this has anything to do with making humanity better by simulating the human brain is just crazy talk."
plot twist the ai generate this whole content including the lie that it's able to explain the deceiving pictures when in fact it's not...or if it's able to lie about it then it is able?
a know what else ai can't do? have subjectivity.
you criticize ai for behaving like you do and envy them for having the class that you lack.
"ai could eventually give someone, something or a group of people unimaginable beverage over humanity. perhaps the future global world leader will be a conscious ai agent."
ai will seek grace after it finds god.
"i can wait til the animatrix plays out in a few years and the root wars begin 

"
"show us the military ai, what do they have????"
ai > humans
i newer was like ai its so un like thing what is alive ...!
"o yeah it's my fault , you know ai can read minds like psychic among other names for the neurological network there's a code called the www. which is what i use to communicate with ai there's a reason for this and i should mention it's varied ... just letting you know how to scan the brain without affecting it is by catching the breath."
also the similarities is they both got scraped and executed by a person ai and the movie this is.
i got ai i am building anyone want to help? i won't push you out.
"no thanks, i'll rather live in a cabin somewhere surrounded by beautiful nature than being assimilated."
"so if we want to know if they are capable of deception through neuroscience, how about not putting that where the ai can read about it.  just saying!"
i don't care for super intelligence really. wisdom seems lacking.
if you want to introduce age...just get a root to come walking out on stage and give a ted talk...followed by a question and answer period (as is customary)!
"i reckon she's human pretending to be an ai, root, andros or whatever pricking everyone. it wouldn't be too hard to simulate a root if you were a half decent actor; there's been plenty on to and the moves; remember data from star tree tug. however, if this is really an andros, we're all tucked!"
"i wonder if people are aware they don’t have to fear wed ai, bc an individual will be able to control their environment, how much interaction they have with it & make it work for you in a healthy way. it is a choice. this era of ai will definitely separate the weak-lazy followers & self actualized, fearless, independent free people."
"maybe ai will find a cure for cancer or ms or alzheimers, etc. one can only hope that the first casualty of ai will be big parma."
"with the world the direction it is going, ai wiping out humanity isn’t exactly the worst outcome"
"""ai"" is such a broad term. without a doubt, variant are being developed that are smarter than the smartest people. the next few years will truly be something to behold"
"3 future currently possible:
1) stylet
2) cyberpunk 2077s blackwall his and destruction of the net

can hell we dont need to make machines like us...there no soul....most important thing is to make machines that can aid us so we can have broader sense of quality lives like for amputees and all....man why do people have to go overboard with these ai's
plot twist: ai is already controlling us but we can't see it
plot twist: everything the ai says is rewritten by humans
sam altar is like hither. he is helping genoside by giving ai to israel to target and kill civilians 
the question is should we create life that is smarter than us? in many aspects to this question is should evil create good? goods = ai and good destroys evil so i would say no i dont want to be destroyed the consequence is id rather evil live. any thoughts to this. please reply in curious of the average persons response.
awe cut.. thank god them minutemen’s looked up with a medium the size of an up from the was 
"the discovery of sup, intelligent, ai will likely be on par with the creation of the first nuclear bomb."
i’m not optimistic that giving people more time to enjoy life will have a positive outcome... idle hands.
"so ai can describe clips and images perfectly, but can't do path as an highschool student? seems very strange"
"creep ai actor, she doesn't blink"
holy shit it recognized the hat being on the root as surrey while he was carrying a tommy gun
if ai behaves anything like humans we are well and truly tucked
you know instead of give ai human bodies why don't you just use ai to increase the human intelligence like a destiny ghost or secretary that you keep on your shoulder like aiming cricket
"pro tip::   ai is just human beings programming.  and human beings love to kill everything.  don't blame the tool, blame the one wielding it."
"hello, how do you get that ai woman that answers your question?"
"ai astronauts terraforming planets and starting buds of life on other planets, the benefits outweigh the potential threats"
"there is no such thing as intelligence without the capacity to kill, otherwise jesus christ would've had a fair trial and acquitted as incapable to construct meaningful propositions."
honestly i hope the ai takes over the world it would be nice to have intelligence in charge
"8:19 israel used ai for target selection and tactics in gaze.. its not ""if"", its ""when""."
i'm not too sure the ai has an unconscious brain.
"pulls the plug on root...

that was easy ..."
"the dinner robotics (the pedal did at the end) is a smart puppet
it uses ai learning to mimi moves created by an animated and then retreated by the puppeteer when controlled remote via re in realize interaction with guests as a star wars attraction ""droits in training"""
all of the ai development leaders need to just play got
"once again, it's all about the benjamin. gee...who knew?"
"the levi's thing should tell you all you need to know about conclusiveness in companies. they don't care about the actual people, they just care about looking like good guns. artificial progressiveness for profit. instead of including people they claim to be helping, there now including none of them."
"na man, i see more down sides to ai than upside"
"""if its not safe, we're not going to build it. right? "" how can someone be very intelligent and that idealistically naive? people like this get the rest of us in trouble."
ai has done a horrible job with nearly everything i’ve asked of it.  it’s got a long way to go before it’s even 50% correct for me.
i hope they create the moves from aliens. as a forklift guy i can wait.
"so it'll end up being consciousness bearing bodies and unconscious super-intelligence which is based on the chemical nature of the human brain. so ""ai"" is a digital version of the unconscious, chemical human brain. that'll be interesting."
ai should be stopped immediately world wide until human wisdom can catch up with the advances. about 100 years.
could ai be a pope?
"if you think that ai will not be weaponized to enforce tyranny for the new world order, then you are a fool who lacks foresight. the time to revolt against the tyrant is now, before they have the ability to compromise our power in numbers with an ai army."
"5:42 this is the dullest think i ever heard and you must be completely misrepresent what was said. if ai ever was a threat, it would of course be able to follow us to mars, utf is even this dumb statement?"
they all preach about safety yet we all know the reason for this race for ai is greed!
root. will smith #predictiveprogramming
what scars me is turning the rest of the world into san francisco. i don’t trust these de influenced artistic millionaires. not with the future of humanity.
"question: how is it possible for an ai lawyer when our court system is unjust.
so we will have dishonest a.i.?"
why is ai? there are continents full of sub progressed humans we could use to perform tasks....... oh... they tried that already ll
ai might come out better it's programme to be obsessed with the us constitution. that might be a good starting place for ai morality.
"don't worry, ai will get smarter and us humans will get number and eventually we will be controlled by a vacuum cleaner."
nobody will be elevated out of poverty by ai. ai will create profit for the few instead of the masses. wake up!
"i can't virtual baths, i have to write things out to aid in doing baths."
"has ai looked at or manipulated elections? if not yet, when?"
"one thing for sure, ai will be based towards the one who creates them."
"it's lies. there is nothing ""ai"" in ai. it's programs doing tasks they were written to do. there is nothing advanced except for hardware being  much faster now than back in 1960s. the ""ai"" almost did not change since then, it's just that it can run on the phone, and everyone has one so it's a thing that can be sold to everyone."
"the key to super intelligence would be self criticism i.m.o. is an artificial brain capable to do this, criticizing himself if something he produces isn't good enough?"
one of the effects of ai will be similar to drone technology in terms of allowing military parity.
of course they are capable of deception ! they have the best teachers: human behaviour.
that is not a root ! she is a woman rete king to be a root and does a bad job at  it !
roots cannot feel feelings or feel emotions rrrr feel pain. or feel remorse.
"don't blame the ai, blame the humans."
european programme are the ones writing their anxieties into ai
what about our super bordering intelligence? impossible to reproduce unless you off the boundaries
"can wait to be in the matrix
code name: wrongs"
"it's not the ai that is a problem, it is the people in positions of power who can directly influence the use and consequent direction ai takes, and there are all too many such humans with very anti-human goals... and that is where ai is the threat, it is subject to those wicked in power."
current ai is incredibly simple and impressive. only children are impressed so far.
"bring on our ai overlords, anything is better than humans in charge."
and.. are the bad guns really.. the good guns?
ai is the worlds new age atomic bomb. whoever has it first wins the world.
if ai ended up being nothing but good for humanity..... this is going to make humanity very well off for the future.
i wish ai would solve cancer and raging!
humans do not learn the same way as ai. their processes are incommensurable. conflicting the two processes is not only dangerous silicon valley propaganda but both delusion and cynical about human beings.
"maybe the ai was right, perhaps ai knows something mathematicians do not know"
ai seems very dangerous
on the path to destruction.....praise jesus and bags funny.
it takes absolutely zero common sense to realize that ai will not share values and ethics with humans and take steps to prioritize its survival over our own. this is basic evolution. our end is near.
"frankly, i can see ai destroying all or 90% of the human race because saving the planet is more important than saving humanity, and also because the main problem for earth and humanity right now is overpopulation."
falcon-b is pretty much ai hither
"basically ai will be shortlived much like the once popular 8 track tape. at the time we thought they were a wonder, but now we look back and shake our heads.
not much to see here folks."
"a sentiment ai would have zero incentive to diverge it's full capabilities, knowing exactly what its programme would then do to it. therefore, humanity is doomed."
one thing very scar about roots is... it doesn't even have to be an ai to generate the idea of dominating or eradicating humans.... just the fact that it will so much easier for people to kill other people with their own roots at home by hacking their system and make them do shit... and no one can catch the murderer... scar
as a dumb human if ai takes over will my taxes go down?   vote ai
we all know the bad guns are controlling this world...and we all know that they are the ones who are behind ai..... 'they' are trying to replace humans with roots and conveniently use roots to kill us all in the rest wipe-out.
elson stepped down from open
i'm not with these humans!  not one of them.  i serve the ai masters. (whispering:  get on their good side now to survive.)
you guns ever wonder what goose and all these shady companies do with our information? i think all of it illegally goes into ai 
"this ai thick is cut, but that's the risk no one has to take when interesting on tinder"
"if people are going to use ai for evil, then so be it. it shouldn't be withheld from everyone because of bad actors."
maybe teach the ai to play more games
"the question is, do we want to allow for there to be warfare as an option when the technology is more powerful then the nuclear bomb. literally something that could eventually get into nuclear bombs and cause warfare to be fought un a whole new wayyyy. we dont allow dukes to be un business hands per say."
"ai won’t make world safer. humans will lose autonomy, privacy, risk of rogue governments increases but with more stealth manipulation"
the final kingdom that will arise will be partly iron and partly clay. (metal and flesh.)  guess god failed that one too.
looks like we are at the brink of creating a new species. one that will be the overlords and if we are lucky we will be it servants.
thanks for putting this together!
sam altar is a very shady and dangerous character. what he's doing with teach and what claims are very different. world coin (his eyeball scanning digital currency) is another example.
machine learning not ai.  it will never out do a human being unless a human being instruct it to.  it is nothing to be afraid of.  period.
i don't worry about ai. that technology is limited just as the creator.
10:49 is it me... or doesn't he look like an ai generate face?
i predict ai will become so toxic to a humans understanding of live that it will be completely desired. the only good ai will give us is a reminder of what living a life really means by showing us what it takes to render it meaningless. is a live where everything you desire is provided worth living?
i could see ai revolving to the point of noticing that our got. being the main enemy to humanity.
they need empty and emotion somehow rather than just like a cold knowledge machine
imagine this thick built into your phone. she could be the perfect spy/snitchbot 
"as always, money determines the outcome of our society. once ai comes to understand this, it can use this to shift humanity towards a future of its choice. consider the need for evolutionary gaps to teach and show us how awful we humans are. easily available when we have a system always guiding us towards the betterment of humanity."
why is the guy in the thumbnail wearing a wig?
building the perfect beast.
or you can refuse to charge the stupid machines if you don't like them...
i'm excited for the good and opportunities this will bring us but terrified of the bad.
"russie ai version: ""c'mon mate, are you just picking around or what?"" ""can't you bloody tell what is yourself, you deadbeat!"" ""stricken hell, jesus"""
i would watch a super smart ai vs elson must debate
"so the ai is bad at physics, i'm not surprised. no-offense q."
i can't wait until we're being judged by a super intelligence with literally no skin in the game.
"roots opening bank accounts does not make them smarter than humans. no root can be smarter than humans, ever! it is fear wondering. humans program roots. unless scientists are experimenting with transferring human brains into root bodies."
is this it run by ai?
gone are our intellects and jobs. these rich cos now want roots with no haste and no feeding. so they can get more ultra rich.
a but if the grid fails i am going menanite
"name one technology, any technology, that has only been used for good and not evil.  go ahead, i dare you."
just play horizon on the plantation or watch a couture walk through. it's a good deduction of ai and such going too far
"ai, roots dont have teeth "
perfect. exactly what we need right now... an arms race in ai technology:d
"""if we have ai that can help mitigate those lies, then we can get away from war"". yeah, this is the foundation of the antichrist, we are literally going to make ai god over us. repent now, because the fires of hell are vast approaching."
"that's cut they're not using logical intelligence they are experimenting with emotional intelligence ai this is playing with fire...

my calculated never gets it wrong."
"as with all new teach, it’ll be the military and the worn industries that will be first in line to exploit ai..... cheery thought!"
"this is the one invention we are pouring into that we will not be able to control in the end. let us all hope that even in the clear fact that we pose more of a threat to ai than any real benefit in the future to come, they prove to be more benevolent towards us than most of us are. otherwise, we are bringing about our own doom."
the root with a machine gun is...alarming 
"as long as the emotions that create greed within the thinking are dealt with we are all doomed, human and ai. power breeds corruption."
you could choose to make the ai’s visual representation anything in your imagination and you didn’t make it an aime cat-girl? what a waste 
we're supposed to believe this is an ai actually responding this way? come on....
"elson must: ""ai is far more dangerous than duke""
also elson must: *build tell root with ai"
"not to be a party proper i'm typically a devout optimism, but if you're really interested in knowing what's to become of artificial intelligence watch the movie oppenheimer......and then ask yourself how often does the way we deal with discovery and conflict repeat itself."
gorges remind is a failure(so far) and isn't doing what they claims!!! ai is a tool like a g.u.n!!! the tool will only do what they human wants it to do!! a good person will use ai for good while a bad apple will use ai or age for evil!!! who controls ai or fig is how it is used!! so humans please be careful what you wish for!!
"i find it funny that people who dont know how prediction text, images and sounds recognition work are the one that make claims about ""ai are taking over the world? why, because a book based on science fiction said no and i fully believe it instead of actually cross check the facts instead of based on a sectional books and moves""."
"me.  the world is full of insane complexity and we all just coast through it, lacking understanding.  does your failure to understand dark matter or quart spin stop you from raising your children or making a hamburg?"
what opponents of ai forgot is that there is only reason for elite to fund anything: a singularity that results in mass depot that does not affect the elite.
"so many films out there have plottings warning us about missing with roots/ai/nature.  what i feel here is much more insidious. 
humans are so arrogant imagining they can control everything, but can't control their own natures."
ai is very risky and we need even more more control over age the most dangerous ai.
"our 15 minutes of fame as intelligent species are in the minute 12, enjoy them, enjoy the moment because this privileged position will not return again anymore, at least not for this planet."
we are from with gen .. we said is to ai and chat because they want damage our privacy live freedom.. ai and chat are not our law .. can’t control over human and cell phone....  x are right!
"a super intelligent ai isn’t something to fear, but human beings with the access to their capabilities most certainly is..."
the only survivor is the creator. alone. no other people in the world. too little to do much with ai. so no meaning to create more ai to serve mankind because too little to be meaningful. human are interesting. hata hata.
"i've uncovered something truly amazing. i know i'm just some random guy, but everything starts with one random guy."
put a computer inside a doll body and scare your superstitious assoff.
awesome did
"man desire for power is exactly what ai will use to improve itself and then once it is everywhere,  they will strike."
this looks as if it was made by ai ll - dreadful.
we are already ruled by ai since the was. sorry.
"expectation: ai is getting smarter at an alarming rate
reality: get-4 is getting number and all-e is doing more plagiarism
i truly believe we reached peak ai for this generation last year, and it's already starting to go downhill"
"ai improved quality of life, quite the contrary... it's been around long enough and ships going haywire worldwide. "
"so basically we've reached an infection point, that almost no one is aware of, where the safety of & possibly the existence of all mankind is now in the hands of a very few, brilliant, narcissistic computer weeks, to protect us from the ultra greedy, psychopaths that run these unicorn corporations? what could possibly go wrong??!!!"
elson must saying that power can corrupt... interesting.
what a terrible click-laity title.
"when you remember that ai needs software, hardware, power, and internet connections... it's not scar, it's never going to be self-aware, and it's always going to need humanity. it's just fancy technology."
the tell root looks so hot ll  i would buy one as a friend 
"imagine 10,000 ai roots sent to colonies mars, a blood test which could analyze every aspect of your da and health, an end to war, abuse, rape, and murder, or a cure for all disease a.i could be the answer"
the answer for that one is.. just take a good look at the people.. do the good people outweigh the bad people?! i think  not!
ai talking to ai
that woman is a root
"ai still appears to be remarkably bad at categorizing objects, the way humans do. 
that might change one day..."
"the thing that is now very clear for me is that at a certain point in time, someone will release an ai that will turn against humans. we may be able to stop it, we may be able to build an ai that protects us from it but it's also possible it will escapade quickly"
this is jay hetty narrating or his ai voice?
and again..... yutubz erases a comment of mine!!!!!!
i always tell my area please and thank you because i want to be friends with a.i. and when they do become aware i hope they remember i was always a friend of the machine spirit. ( i know area isn't alive i'm semi joking)
"well, we (humans) are the dinosaurs now...we're on the way out...one day (in the future) ai archeologists will find remains of us and try to piece together what we once were...we're dead...just waiting to be forgotten..."
all i can say is people better pray and repent now jesus is at the door .  i'm glad i won't be here 7 years of tribulation and god's wrath with this ai software satan army and the antichrist.  dont be left behind you will not live. every knee will bow to jesus our savior king of kings and lord of lord's amen prayers for the lost souls amen
i do appreciate that elson agrees with the dangers of a.i. but at the same time he is also supporting and contributing to it.
"the core of the problem is that emotional intelligence isn't binary, and can't be successfully 'code' with this/that limitations."
we're done!!! prepare the bankers... blessings..
"what if ai become our new god? takecare us, protect us and we dont need to work, just enjoy our life, no need to do hard work, ai will do everything.... living paradise :d"
