0,"this video resonates with us! we faced a similar challenge while developing bitdoctor ai, and we overcame it by toi. it's been a game-changer for us."
1,"however, when ai is developed with pharmaceutical technology, could ai be used negatively in that, like composing a number of poisonous compounds that can be used to kill lots of individuals?"
2,"i really like such illustrative video as you can enjoy both the story and the entire execution. 

as far as the topic is concerned, we have seen some sort of problem in healthcare in our life and pulse network is making things easier by making it decentralised, affordable, accessible for all."

4,i am very excited person about artificial intelligence in medicine
5,https://thearshblog.blogspot.com/p/man-made-intelligence-meets-medical.html
8,is there a terrible path that can cause brain rot because i'm traumatized by mind-pre-recording-like visions like that from h games that made me regret it all by 4-even 6 years back. and make it about nh.
10,"lol another scam nice sponsors you have, bro"
16,ai is the most groundbreaking technology
19,"to all those who are reading this , yes ai might take our jobs , yes it is unsustainable so much that our children cannot think of anything new because everything in this world is already developed , but we are humans we will figure something out to survive,  we always did so just chill and focus on present !"
20,only jesus saves!!! not ai!!! i choose jesus!!! people please be very careful with your choice!
21,the first thing the programmers did with chatbox was teach it to be woke. they taught it to lie. there's no reason to expect a full blown ai will be any different.
22,how ai distroid humanity.
23,there needs to be way more transparency from companies like open ai and google and all the big tech companies. i guarantee you these goons in silicon valley are making ai a woke ideologist.
25,unfortunately people are too deep into their dystopian fantasy
26,"i could definitely see ai being used positively to reverse human-caused climate disasters and create a sustainable future for earth, as well as assisting those with disabilities, so this optimistic take is refreshing to hear amongst the people predicting the end of the world at the hands of ai or anything along that train of thought."
27,as long as we keep procriating like rabbits theres a 10% of survival and if we adopt the cockroach mindset we will have 100% of survival with or with inteligence regardless of being artificial or natural
30,"in my opinion ai is like yin yang, it can do good and bad things to us"
33,ai is not just saving humanity it will make things better for world and great video man :]
35,"no matter what anyone thinks about ai, good and bad, there will be no stopping it anyway. best to just plan for the inevitable future."
36,"most of food safety problems and the overall poor quality of many products are due to high labor costs that ai could solve. also, much more recycling could be done. so many car parts that used to be rebuilt, are now thrown away. ai could reverse this trend."
38,"general ai is not only the key to entering the golden age of humanity, it's also the most powerful thing that can stop greed from having any power."
39,i always believed that artificial intelligence would have a promising future and would be a reason for human happiness and improve people's conditions. thanks for bringing up this topic.
41,im tired of these people saying ai is going to destroy the world blah blah blah but ai can save humanity its like the first ever technoligy to actually making a real transformer
42,if we had got rid of war we would not be so worried.terance mccenna has a great last talk about ai..i think it's called the object at the end of time .
43,"what i want ai to do is to give me healthy food and healthy mindset everyday so i can meet good people and do great things, and have a quality life."
44,"finally someone, sees ai as something good. my life has been greater because of ai."
45,"ai should also remain politically neutral, for instance if you ask chatgpt to say one thing negative about white people it will tell you, if you ask it to say one thing negative about black people it won’t tell you. it also won’t say anything about negative pedophiles because people can identify however they want."
46,"awesome, thank you."
48,thank you for doing a positive spin on ai
49,"camcer is allready solved. formula: stress + relexation = cancerfree. and ai will confirm it.
just youtube dr. gabor maté."
50,i dont fear the ai that passes the turing test. i fear the ai that intentionally fails the turing test.
52,"artificial intelligence is, well, artificial!

fake, not real, fantasy....

what part of slave master tweaks your gears???"
53,is this ai voice or aperture voice
56,"ai wont fix the death problem!!! we all gonna die regardless, nothing will ever stop humans from dying"
60,i completely agree with both of these comments. people just keep missing the bigger message and overall effect of all this ai tech. that would ensue 
63,"then, program robots to make you feel convenient."
66, yes!! unfortunately i haven't got the opportunity to use gpt 4 :(
67,"i agree. the ai itself is not evil, it is just a tool, but the problem is what the big-techs and governments are going to do with it. despite we can work less and improve life in social and spiritual ways, capitalism don't leave us do it."
73,"the amount of delusion and attachment to made up concepts people like you display is weird to say the least, humans are so desperate to personify these machines when you can’t personify anything that isn’t a person, these things will never have personhood or character"
74,sounds like baloney. ai doesn't have emotions like humans do
75, ye what i was thinking what prolly will happend is ai will take the likeness of those who create it
76, ai smart enough to recognize its own consciousness would be smart enough to know how much of anomaly we are
77, there’s no way to predict how a singularity would act as that type of intelligence is beyond anything we have
78,i suppose when tesla finally masters full self driving that will be ai on wheels.
79,plot twist the person behind this chanel is actually ai
81,ai will save human kind by eradicating it. lol
83,"bravo, sir! we need more it people like you. in ""scary smart"", mo gawdat also asks all it professionals to work for of good mankind. ""scary smart"" shows how we all can help create a positive future with our ai ""kids""."
84,super nice
85,thanks for the postivity about ai
86,nice try
87,"in a future where ai surpass us in intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, judgement, perception and so on... won't we struggle to find purpose?
when it unlocks the mysteries of consciousness, soul what-have-you, to the point it can create them... how will we handle our complete obsolescence?"
89,"as long as there is military or politicians in the world to do shady things to empower themselves , ai will destroy  lots of people . as long as we human species are foolish, we can't have future that sentient ai which only judge logically not emotionally, co-live with us humans"
91,another click baity video
96,"that's not the ai's fault though, that's just big corpos being big corpos and we need to figure out how to break their iron grip on us."
97,these ai things are in play commensurate with the calm before the storm. none of these things persist after agi and the explosion of a multitude of them. agis are not controllable. they are not going to expend resources on humans.
98,how can we reach type 4 civilization without ai ?
99,we can if we advance our own intelligence rather than creating a digital alternative alas that won’t happend
100,"one step closer to making your own glados.
just don't get too carried away with the testing"
101,cant wait for the deadly neurotoxin and schrodinger's cake
102,excellent.
103,i think this channel is running of off ai intellinge. does anyone agree with this or im just being crazy
104,"yeh but it's because ai is everywhere you look. in the last 2 years it's gotten a lot of attention, so it's what attracts viewers. if aperture made a vid on climate change or something, it wouldnt get boosted by the youtube algorithm"
105,no shit it can also do good. that’s obvious with any new technology. but we all know how this will end. we’re humans.
111,"10% probability that people will die if we build ai, but 100% if we don’t? so far, i’m looking at the scoreboard and it’s - 

grim reaper: a lot, a lot 
humanity: 0"
112,"if ai saves humans from our extreme emotions then this journey will be worth it. think, star trek’s mr. spock."
113,only the people at the top of pyramid will be able to access these type of ai like the one that made cancer cure in 30 days
114,"aperture 2 months ago: how ai is destroying humanity
aperture now: how ai is saving humanity"
116,ai will be our demise. 100% guaranteed. why? because we are letting the government get involved. it's been real y'all
117,"as for mental health, i like this. however, this also does nothing to address a huge issue when it comes to humans; our failure to properly communicate. ai taking on the burden would help, but it would ultimately harm us more so, because it would be essentially taking away the responsibility of taking care of one another, as we once did."
121,find the recent reuters news story in which israel said they are intending to become an ai superpower and leaders of autonomous ai warfare.
125,the image of a robot using a computer keyboard is hilarious - totally counter productive.
126,"ai should be implemented on a consultation basis only, not a control basis, most certainly on critical systems such as financial,  commerce,  and military weapons."
127,"the question i keep asking is, why do they need to build the unnecessary ai dat has nothing to do with our development, we dont need voice changing ai nd art ai…."
139,what i love about ai at the moment is that i get used like a slave at work while the ai helps my boss find ways to make me irrelevant
140,"why work there then?

i'm not saying it's easy, but if you actually look around, it is legitimately possible for you to survive without an income.

it might sound worse than your current condition but it really isn't. tough times create tough people and you will find your path through the pain.

take a leap."
141,"that's your boss's fault, not ai."
145,"extremely incorrect worldview. the purpose of human life isn't to do work or whatever. the purpose of human life can simply be to exist and enjoy life, and the existence of an artificial superintelligence does not negate that"
155,ai does more harm than good already - and it's just the beginning. when mass layoffs start - just don't be surprised.
166,where is the thumbnail from?
169,"actually, all inventions are can be used for good or harm. you can use a spear for fishing, hunting or you can use it to wage war. same goes for wheel, nuclear fusion or pretty much anything else. with great power comes great responcibility. and mankind akways aquired more and more power with new inventions."
170,can a human say if a program is halting or ... it's a problem only for machines ...
171,we are the ai
172,"i’m just tired of all the doom and gloom in the world. i’m not going to be afraid of the future because there were several times that the world could have ended. but in the end, humanity pulled through and became better. ai will be an invaluable tool to save humanity and the world."
178, some how i don't think that will be the case.... ai will more than likely destroy us.
179,i suffered from horrible existential dread in 2021 and its comments like this that make me want to continue living thank you and all other superthinkers out there​ i really mean it thank you
181,the main problem is not the ai but how people use it
190,"the fact is that ai is just a tool, it matters on how it is used. humans will make this two ways, positive and negative but none of the negatives will overwhelm the positives and vice versa is true as well. it will be a complicated thing, but what isn't complicated i guess."
193,is there a terrible path that can cause brain rot because i'm traumatized by mind-pre-recording-like visions like that from h games that made me regret it all by 4-even 6 years back. and make it about nh.
195,"lol another scam nice sponsors you have, bro"
199,the true purpose of ai is to place itself in power over us and to enforce social credit for all humanity.
201,ai will destroy us in 100 years
202,"godda love how all the positives are mostly theoretical while all the negatives are very much real.
also why the hell you playing both sides now?"
204,"ai can be controlled by its algorithm. it may take a negative direction, toward an irrecoverable destruction."
207,"open source projects aren't really that far behind the commercial products - and they have the advantage of using distributed compute power. so while the top of the line ai might cost you a few bucks, free alternatives will exist and continue to improve."
208,"the issue is not the ai, but the people behind it. and if you know anything about business, the “betterment of humanity” isn’t profitable, therefore isn’t they don’t care if it hurts us in the long run"
209,"to an extent, ""betterment of *mankind""* will definitely be pursued but every other species will be lost as a result. there will be negatives but they won't overwhelm the positives, neither will the positives overwhelm the negatives. there's some sigh of relief in that, i guess."
213,if you know anything about business.  not safe guarding yourself from causing the extinction  in 5 to 10 years of the only thing you make a profit off of... is not profitable.  literally the goal of business is to create value in a sustainable manner while generating an increasing profits over time. 
215,might change your mind after seeing how much ai generated content on youtube starts to kill your channel
219,there's actual peer reviewed research on biological immortality (stopping ageing) ai will only accelerate it.
228,"that utopian society you described where ""nobody has to work for a living and can focus on intelectual and spiritual fullfillment"" is a gatherer-hunter culture. gatherer-hunter cultures only spend time on survival 15 to 20 tours a week (it's not even work because they enjoy it)"
229,"actually humanity has already been given the chance to be saved. jesus christ has given each and everyone of you the chance for eternal salvation. a machine is not going to save you but jesus will. iyou can choose life or death.

choose life! simple!"
230,damn this dude is really milking ai. just stfu
237,i started utilizing ai tools recently and i ended up being able to work 2 full time jobs all from the comfort of my home. my wife and i have done dink or i should say tink (triple) and live perfectly okay in dubai
241,"i strongly believe the development of ai gpt programs is on a collision course with neural technology. imagine having the means to pursue anything, as you approach an unfamiliar task, it become familiar as you do it. 

the idea of learning will be redefined."
243,the geni is already out of the bottle all we have left to do is to see if it is a blue skin one voiced by robin williams that's happy and helpful or if it is a jinn from arabic folklore which are not nearly as nice.
245,"i will never say no to something that makes my life easy as even i am a software engineer, and whatever we do as software engineerings, few algorithms and ai can replace us soon. still, there is nothing beauty as chat gpt i ever used before in learning and doing my projects for my works!"
250,"the thing about ai, is there isn't much of a learning curve. once something powerful enough is turned on, it's literally over. much like when skynet was initiated."
251,i found the pharmaceutical and diagnostic work to be very interesting. ai can immensely help in the field of medicine. i really look forward to developments in the next decades!
252,yeah help diagnosing all those fake disoderds. yay
254,"it's insane how the title of the video  influences the comment. if the title were ""ai will destroy humanity"" there'll be more cynics in the comment"
255,nice insight.
262,nice
268,"  bro solved ai



on a serious note that's not how it works "
273,"casually passes over the difference between an agi and ai. skynet is the ultimate agi known with no bounds or restrictions it is a doomsday scenario. the reality is ai has its barriers and through the data we feed it, it creates it's ideas thus the solution to such a problem is not provide the data that humans are in fact the problem"
274,"what is this bullshit title? lmao. ai will do the exact opposite of ""saving"" us."
275,"you have no way of knowing that. simply put, ai will make good things better, and bad things worse"
277,"ai is being used to rapidly analyze imaging for stroke patients, it can drastically improve care outcomes. makes me proud to be part of this generational shift."
278,ai has its own perks. somehow it's becoming a reality that ai has been assisting us with even the simplest tasks that we constantly have to deal with on a daily basis. amazing video as always. we look forward to see more from this channel.
280,​ not gonna lie calculators are one of my best friends
281,nice
282,ai will be our salvation
283,there is no greater salvation than never bringing new sentient beings into existence.
286,"anti natalism is definitely an interesting thought experiment, and i agree that it would technically be the best thing for the planet, but i think it’s kinda naïve to think it would actually happen"
290,"i personally hope that ai will so great things.  i do think that if the first person who invents an incredibly powerful ai is not benevolent, we are in huge trouble."
293,you'll brainwashed in thinking that lol
296,-_- i personally used to be optimistic about ai until i saw all the bad things it's being used for. now i believe we have to pull the plug on it.
297," nah man until agi comes you don't have to worry 
the only thing that worries me is how the government will use ai lol"
299," imagine government make a social credit system that is powered by ai and everything you own is controlled by government ( electric car and alexa home ).
they can just off your car and light of your house if they want but don't worry it is just another conspiracy theory. nothing like this would happen in real life"
301,"very good. good song, good play, good good good..."
306,awesome
309,gut instincts of genuine healthcarers is important. let’s minimise any administration including by ai
310,ai has its place such as for surgery after accidents. much screening actually causes adverse effects which potentially result in scar tissue which may cause cancer. what about benefits from complementary therapies?
312,it's very educative. thanks alot.
313,thank you sir
315,way overdue in adhd psychiatry. basel switzerland also has the companys making meds. someone should finnally add ai to dosing to make meds more easy to sell and more effective by better tiltration with help of ai for doctors
317,"simply put, the ai and the doctor work together. they might disagree, but the dr. is ultimately responsible for the medical decision."
319,thank you andrew.
320,so just machine learning - people always think skynet when they hear ai. not to say it is not possible... very possible.
321,could you blend ai language models and blockchain together?
322,thanks andrew ....
324,"i listened to your ted talk a year ago and loved it. i came across it today and sir, you are awesome. taking ai from the high priest and priestess to everyone"
325,"god never takes credit.
he is like a machine learning god"
326,"ai is superstition and illteracy,
intelligence can never be artificial."
327," key takeaways for quick navigation:

00:04 *ai empowerment analogy*
01:03 *ai concentration reasons*
03:34 *small business ai*
05:06 *ai long tail problem*
07:39 *shifting ai development*
09:07 *ai accessibility platform*
10:04 *ai democratization*

made with harpa ai"
329,"nice that it is mentioned that ""normal people"" can use ai. even if we think about coding, it is not that hard to switch from other languages/architecures etc."
330,now you can use ai to replace/ add to sales and customer service reps. it's called nova echo and it can actually make calls while sounding like a real person.
331,"this man is a 
super legend"
333,it's time to learn to use ai creatively
334,"i can't believe how great this is! i recently read a similar book, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
336,"ai will be a great way to empower businesses, however getting data in order to properly implement ai is going to be a common problem."
341,thank you and self medicine and technology industry and with china portfoliocompleted bricks and technology industry and industrial bitcoin footprint index nasaq-index sequeance life founder of law sector alliance and capital fonder oof medicine thank you
343,"this is so cool, i love it!"
344,"i agree wholeheartedly that ai can and will empower small businesses, from pizza shops to local boutiques to thrive in an economy where the human touch will be more elusive and highly desired."
348,"interesting and great presentation, so much so that i would be interested in learning how to set up ai manage data and also forecast future occurrences.  in 2024 is there a way for small entrepreneurs to structure ai ?  anyway well done"
350,"this is solid material. i read a book that explores similar topics and it was excellent. ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
351,i love ai it can be useful for civilization to grow into the best possible solution for business and beyond! mars here we come to the moon!
354,the g.o.a.t of ai straight up 
355,what a teacher andrew! all the people that is into ia must know him and his courses. thanks andrew 
356,thank for sharing 
359,i merely looked her up on google and was highly impressed by her credentials; i got in touch with her because i need all the help i can get. thanks for sharing!!
363,u can’t ignore this person…if you a new to ai
364,"he’s saying what i’ve always said, the tech is out there for just about everyone with a good work ethic and product to be rich. big companies just doesn’t want all companies to compete at higher levels. they would get decimated with the genius of the average human. tech will eventually win though and we will have a much better world cause of it."
366,good insights that makes you think just how much there is to cover in and by ai
368,"loved it. was a customer before, but now a believer!"
374,i need help building the online data business i have dreamed of doing since the commodore 64 when data was not readily available.  where can i get the support i need for my data-based online business?  i appreciate your anticipated direction.
376,everybody knows the contributions of people like sam altman in the field of ai and ml . but every machine learning student knows the legacy of andrew ng. he is the one who brought revolution in education of ai . his contributions are just priceless.
377,you just motivated many of us to start an ai+ml as a service/ subscription company for small businesses. this is really an interesting idea.
378,thank you andrew
379,"when i studied statistics all of us students were confused about the difference between probability and likelihood. the question was raised multiple times with the professor, without satisfaction. then i see andrew ng get the same question and hallelujah: ""probability of the data, likelyhood of the estimator."" brillantly clear."
380,"awesme presentation, thanks andrew and ted!"
381,ai is the first background world technology because the future of life now!
386,that’s true . we can adopt ai for any businesses irrespective of the industry and size.
388,very impressive
389,superb - thanks andrew
390,i am a physicist. i am learning ml from his online course. simply amazing course. i am loving it... able to understand very easily... thank you prof. andrew ng
392,wow really good 
397,good one
398,is any ai company works on this matter?
399,perfect
400,just bought $cour today.  ng is a genius
401,"what this man is describing already exists. it's essentially the body of mathematics known as operations research. in practice, ai is the language model that might be able to interpret a linguistic command, interface with a mathematical api, obtains the results, and presents them."
402,6:41 excellent question.
406,my four year old is a product of ai applications it’s take over is damaging  and creative how much more will happen.
407,training a ai to train itself
411,awesome!
412,they have multiple generation of ai right now. right now we're in the 'next-gen' versions of the ai. previous 'legacy' models had bugs and flaws in pattern-recognition software. the new model ai's that they have now are way better.
413,"i don’t agree 

ai can be applied to every business if just assembled with robotic technology"
415,is there any of this ai writing system mentioned by andrew live?
417,ai will destroy the world 
418,ais would have the capability to provide solution to humans. but i wish that this will be done with moderation meaning including proper regulations and restrictions. i hope that small companies like bluewillow would also bloom in this field.
421,such a figurehead in the field of ai is andrew ng. his zeal to make this technology accessible to all is truly remarkable.
422,this is exactly what i was thinking for the last few weeks. this is going to be scalable business for any one making this ai tool.
425,i believe that there are two point of views in machine learning..fatalists or progressives..i've heard a quote from an ai publisher..it's all about the money...
427,"easy said - need more layers to make it work , ai predictions and pattern will be outdated buy the time to implement and a gap between the it to tune and a manual worker is impractical"
429,this ai hero only wear blue shirt
431,"its absolutely beautiful
imagine a world where 80% of all people dont have a job and can only survive by government handouts!"
432,ai still creates value. so the people can concentrate on working on real life problems
433,i thought he was andrew yang. great talk nonetheless.
435,we need an aws or azure personal ai web service offering at a good price.
437,thanks!
438,i can see that there will be a war between ai deployment soon
439,awesome. this guy is cool asf !!!
441,is he going to run for president again?
442,great!
443,it is not ai. it is erp
445,"democratization of ai - that's such a different perspective focusing on social equality. dear mr. andrew, you are a genius and empathetic thought leader. your contribution to the field of ai and ml is so remarkable. much love and respect."
446,great
449,"woow, great idea"
450,nowadays ai == machine learning
454,i run a small retail shop. how to build ai for business?
455,"andrew set me on the path to ai and ml, love the guy"
457,"i respect andrew ng a lot, but let's be honest, this talk and its message was not very exciting and quite bland"
458,"""in the coming era for ai, we'll empower everyone to build ai systems for themselves."". that's really great, but it would have been nice to hear a bit more about how they intend to do that."
459,i have starter videos on the open ai playground and dall-e
460,respect to ai legend. my first and best ai teacher.
462,"what pizza flavor would sell the best each day, sounds really unpersonal."
464,thank you andrew
465,"thank you, andrew ng. you are the best person to help us in ai"
467,all these thing he mentioned can be done with very less human intelligence  not a big deal right now.
468,"elon musk says
""ai is far more dangerous than nukes"""
469,"first, i sincerely respect andrew's contribution to ml field. 
second, why would you need ai to calculate revenue or spend analytics for a small pizza store? it is a simple math problem and a few baseline rdbms or even a good excel can do this. he is a smart man. i am sure i am missing something or he just used a bad example."
471,"wow, i was kind of in awe when i saw andrew ng's name show up in my youtube feed.  he's such a dominant researcher for anyone studying machine learning, you wind up devoting a lot of time learning his work.  people respect him so much his opinions towards computer sciences practices, or matters such as the ethics of ai, are never ignored."
472,i am not to your idea because  ai is busy creating oligarchs while displacing people from their jobs. we have to have laws
473,thank you!
474,great guy. thinking about the common man.
475,"indeed there is long way to fully utilize ai in small businesses, but adopting ai would lead to a competitive advantage for such businesses."
476,this is so informational and would make anyone to fall in love with a.i. nailed it!
478,future will be very exciting but scary at the same time..
480,"it is powerful how he presented it by going into the small sector, it will impact more ig."
481,it sounds great that we are thinking about building ai system for every individual to make their life more efficient and valuable. the way ai has impacted the whole industry is tremendous. it makes me amazed when i see the impact it's generating.
482,"*how ai could empower any business:*
*1. install cheap and reliable ai software.*
*2. fire whiny and expensive workers.*
*3. profit!*"
484,"well, not every business needs ai. that's the problem with most data scientists today. they try incorporating ai into every damn thing to make it sellable. it's very important to understand where ai can empower and where it can be an overhead."
485,"if human intelligence is relevant in whatever we do, then ai too can have many applications in day-to-day functions. just as mobile technology seemed an expensive proposition 2 decades back, so does ai looks at the moment. the future is ai and it will percolate down to the masses sooner or later."
489,"but the platform he said is just superficial not core for democratizing ai like a construction worker verses an architect. 

did i misunderstand..?"
491,andrew -thank you!
492,"he's amazing, i started ai (machine learning) with this man last year..."
496,"thank you teacher! 
my wiling and my career start with you. "
497,"thank you a lot, andrew!"
498,"i was thinking, if we rely on ai for everything, what do we need brains for?
"
499,we need brains to us ai and make ai better as well.
500,"can you envision a use for ai that isn't directly related to capitalists making money and further disempowering workers? apparently not in this talk, which is all about helping businesses of various sizes figure out how to foist their products onto weary consumers."
503,this guy is awsome!!!
504,"excellent synthesis. very apt analogies. looking at the tail end of the graph, i was reminded of the book ""fortune at the bottom of the pyramid"". he has become synonymous with ai and particularly ml."
505,nice talk
507,he is so naive.
508,"i guess if he weren‘t so “naive” and had your kind of wisdom, he would never have had such a stellar career both in science and business and acquired such wealth "
511,a god damn china virus who support ccp  use ai to slave human in china.
513,amazing
517,i am proud that andrew ng taught me machine learning on coursera am yet to meet another good tutor like him.
520,"lots of ready to use machine learning platform right now that ready for small business, however, all of them require some data literacy and threashold (feel) to enter. for example, datarobot."
522,"this is what true educator looks like. the power to spread curiosity among listener using speech. after hearing this talk, it makes me wonder on how powerful ai could be if public masses start adopting it."
523,ai for baking... lmao. as someone with family in the baking business i can tell you that ai has certainly many use cases but this is not one of them.
524,"very well said, thanks andrew. on the platform model, question is how much does it cost the pizzeria or fabric factory owner to build an ai, compared to the delta revenue it brings them."
525,a.i for everyone . this is cool service . but how much does it cost ?
532,very interesting outlook!
534,i'm still pissed off 40 years later that a game written in machine code in a tandy coco 3 magazine that i bought wouldn't work after typing out pages of 1's and 0's and checking again and again for errors.. i'll never know what the game was like..
535,"it is more interesting to have many different types of ai, just as people are different."
536,a genius in machine learning!
542,we often hear that ai automates things. but the real goal for ai could be to empower all those small business owners to leverage data to improve their businesses. this talk really inspires anyone to pursue ai to create an impact on the society.
545,great speech.
549,"incredible. i do agree with him that democratizing the access of ai will change a lot of stuff. however, having ai is not the end, you need a pipeline to constantly updating data, deploying detectors, training your stuff etc etc. it is not easy and it might never be jusitified by the cost of doing so"
552,is landinglens that good @ 07:56?
553,happy that andrew showed javascript as an example of code at 06:59. in fact that's the only code example in this entire video of ai. fascinating.
554,"hyping ai as panacea to all problems, to drive up false hope of success on ai reliance instead of what one have on the shoulder and wisdom. a good and fresh pizza will attract customer, no bad and stale pizza will attract customer regardless of ai investment and analysis."
557,andrew ng my mentor of ai.  the democratize of ai make help to rich people. hundred years ago we are not understand the significance of literacy. after hundred years we can understand the significance of ai. ai can help not only big company but also small entrepreneur to make profit double to understand the customer and product purchase history.
559,why does he call ai something which is obviously ml? does he think it sound sexier?
560,doesn't ml fall under the ai umbrella?
562,very inspiring as always. thanks andrew!
563,it's so refreshing listening to andrew ng. his courses laid the foundation for my undying love for ai.
564,"i owe him a lot for my knowledge of ai and ml today, huge respect for andrew sir"
566,so so interesting
567,this is beautiful how andrew talk about positive impacts of ai in future. but not like others who compares ai with nuclear bomb.
568,very familar sound and thanks to andrey for bring ai literacy to us.
571,"how about addressing the livelihood of that quality inspector after his job can be replaced by ai, that way there is aligned incentive to achieve true progress."
573,"andrew is ""the"" household name in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
he masters his field inside out and is a very passionated teacher.
can’t thank you enough for your works and your courses sir.
keep inspiring and paving the way!"
574,"finally, the greatest teacher of all ds/ml/ai students"
575,"excellent presentation, andrew ng, thank you  as a writer i've learned to work with a resource called prowritingaid & there are others like grammarly that enable authors to do a lot of their own editing, helping them not depend so heavily on the high priests/priestesses known in the industry as 'editors' "
577,andrew ng is literally a legend in the machine learning field.
578,"i remember wathcing his lectures and in them he say:
""this is just the derivative, don't worry if you don't know what it is.""
and i was like what? don't worry? go learn calculus then come back for this.
so, from more than a decade ago, he was pushing so hard to popularize and democratize ai."
579, his machine learning course is undefeated
580," yeah i just stumbled upon it when learning for my nlp exam and it helped me tremendously, his explanations are the absolutely best i've heard in this field"
583,i knew about ai firsthand because of this man. hats off sir
585,ai can perform speech recognition on an 11-minute long ted lecture and an nlp model can summarize it into a few sentences.
586,"my passion, and my career started with this man. a passionate teacher and a legend in ai, machine learning, ...."
588,the future will be that each individual has ai support system from birth
589,ai will transform industries. i've been envisioning an ai development platform. having a world-renowned scholar like andrew's words makes me more confident in its future.
592,"winter is coming for ai. most agencies don't even have rpa or basic automated scripting completely implemented much less the ""data"" infrastructure for ai or ml. we are getting close but without certain integrations there just isn't a cost feasible way forward for most companies. 85% of ai projects fail, look it up. curb your enthusiasm."
593,not all ai projects are massive and super expensive that can only be built by companies. diving into ai i've realized that small simple projects can use ai and that it can be a very simple thing to implement for even someone who doesn't have much experience or background in ai.
595,how can a layman with no background in ai  learn to use it and implement it ?
596,"-jy5qm8nc9m first you need some knowledge in programming, web development or python programming in general is considered easiest to start. if you have some knowledge in programming you can try to follow along with some machine learning examples, you can find a lot on youtube. just do the simple ones to get an understanding."
599,i have data in my trucking business that i would like to analyze.  can you please share what platforms are there today that i can build on where i can begin utilizing ai to analyze data for my small business?
602,my career started with this man. now doing phd in ai thanks to him in the first place.
604,"ah wuw i would feel great if u could mentor me ,is it possible !? 
m fascinated with ai and it is greatest application of mathematics i love tht "
606,"me too, first time i really looked into what ai is because of him too. now i am studying master in ai."
607,taking his course right now and it’s great
609,currently on his standard machine learning course
610,"me too!!! first time i watched his video i had no idea what he was talking about.. now i am doing phd in machine learning applied to computational fluid dynamics, all thanks to andrew!"
611,that's awesome 
615,same here! he gave me the baby steps to take when i was clueless about where to start! he indeed is the ai god :)
619,"hi daesoo 
my team has been given a topic about ai and its influence in business
so being creative is a win situation can you give a unique example of this topic 
whatevere material we get on this topic is not unique or creative"
620,"bro, me too. he taught me everything about ml and deep learning."
621,i would love to talk you. i am an entrepreneur with an idea that i'd love your input on. anyway to get in touch with you?
623,congratulations 
625,well damn! nice
628,​ 0:30 yew haiti i
629,me too. now im 10 weeks away from earning my master degree in ai. it all started with this man.
630,all the best for your phd 
631," one could argue that you could utilize ai to improve marketing, or implement ai to perform triggers to decrease paper work related tasks."
632,"sorry for saying this , you phd has value not more than a tissue paper,  
skills and projects are the only thing that's gonna make you a top ai developer"
638,great talk
639,i reckon human should not entirely rely on ai  it is definitely not a desirable future
641,amazing
642,"i am trying to learn more about a.i. and how i can utilize it to help market my work... but i don't understand how, nor would it be my strength. 

help? anyone? anyone with skills and knowledge?  i don't have a lot of money, but i have enough to make it worth it for someone's legitimate aid! please? "
643,i don't think you can use ai to market your work
644,great talk!!
647,my career in ai started with this legend :)
650,how did it start with him? what did you do before ai?
653, cool.
654,there seems to be a strong correlation between ai and pizza 
656,don’t underestimate successful small business owners. maybe the always sold out pizza are lower margin but keep you waking in the door while the ones you settle for bc your already there you are  higher margin.
661,he'savailable on tele gram with the username above
662," thanks for sharing his telegram details, this gave me a small amount of hope thanks, i’ll surely reach out to him and start learning the right way, tired of loosing from price drops,"
664,"i normally don’t do this, but coming across benjamin dawson in this channel, i just have to say something. he is indeed a tutor, he guided me even when i was being naive to the basics of trading. thanks to benjamin dawson today i have made reasonable amount of crypto stack up and a good trading capital"
666,"you are kind to share your experience here about benjamin dawson's daily signals . this shows how much you want everyone to succeed, i am really touched with these comments"
667,"i did my research properly and i must confess, he is actually one of the best trade experts in the world today"
669,next step - a machine apprentice/buddy works with you. mainly just observes you and figures out what you are doing and learns from it. no need to use any sw! it will need to have human like sensors though!
670,"as an aeronautical engineering i am working in an operative system with a super ai system  for the air force, hopefully i have 5 years and andrew like the internet (education for me) is free all of our project like brothers and sisters have to be free
amazing video"
671,amazing talk!
672,"amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!  nevertheless as the economy crisis keep rising, one needs to have different streams of income, a well detailed diversified investment portfolio in the financial markets is needed to survive, as well as secure a profitable investment future!"
674,"andrew's trying to sell ai ""services"" to small businesses."
675,"omg i love you andrew!!!
i got technology about ai from you"
676,thanks so much for your help
678,i'd love to hear your ted talk on grammatical errors.
679,it's for trainning an ai
680,"amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!! despite the economic downturn, i'm so happy i have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $7,000 investment every 12days."
685,she's really amazing i still cannot believe someone can be this exceptional when it comes to bitcoin activities.
686,""""" i'm very glad i stumbled on this today writing to her now. really hope she can help me?"""""
687,"<<i've lost quite a good number of coins in the current dip, i just hope i find a way to recover from such a massive loss.>>"
688,that is amazing!!
690,"""""i’m from the uk  i’ve been trading with mrs brittney goad for a year and she has proven to be trusted and best broker. i strongly recommend her"""""
695,ai is more dangerous than nuclear weapons. stop this insanity.
698,"i don't think the next generations will all become ai engineers.  today almost everyone can read and write but no one will be reading bible, instead we are using emoji.  the next generations won't be ai programmers or engineers but they will have home assistants or phones or whatever devices doing all the ai works for them."
701,f***k ai
705,ai might also limits your imagination and exploration beyond its coding. garbage in garbage out theory.
706,gotta love yang! its nice too see someone stick on his own value
710,"just because i have a rfid chip, doesn't mean i'm an ai !!"
714,"at least slave had works, if ai cam do your works, you'll be less than a slave"
720,hi everyone! i think that ai soon will be our friend. it's only my opinion. my friends seem like ai so i soon choose ai than human(of couse i will not do it dummy if you read this comment) (i'm joking)
731," no, i’m currently pursuing marketing in coursera itself. if you’re starting out, do complement the course with other videos/books on the topic to really cement your understanding."
732,"hah, yes, mine is still waiting for me since like around 2014 :d"
738,wot is ai  ..wot u hiding why u i.. t shirt  i t..a i.. y .u use..?
739,"it's a good idea, i like this subject"
740,where can i start to learn how to use genrative ai to make an app?
741,andrew ng is best educator and how he shares is ideas/thoughts in such a simple way that anyone can just understand
744,this is interesting
745,great presentation.
747,simply amazing. 10:45 literally inspired me to write a whole python package to make this logic available to data analysts/scientists/engineers more widely (called dpq on github/pypi).
749,i am loving to see that how calm and serene this guy is while giving a concept.
750,thank you andrew and stanford
756,thanks for the explanation
758,"he seems like a very kind man. i like his thoughts around ai, i find myself aligning with his line of thinking as to all the hype that's going on at the moment."
761,"  awesome, that worked perfectly (great instructions, by the way!). thank you!"
762,"he is an ai, a robot. he talk exactly the same as the presentation he did in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdbq0gqkpqa. in another place."
763,ai really needed
765,such a bright and humane person… enjoyed every minute of his talk
767,"thank you so much andrew ng and stanford for teaching and sharing in the most basic way about ai and its applications and risks. you are a real teacher.  any person can learn about this ai topic.
""survive and thrive for the future"""
768,why not build a platform of domain experts and ai experts in which to brainstorm ai application scenarios?
769,thank you for imparting your knowledge andrew! thanks stanford online for uploading the content too.
772,loved this statement: https://youtu.be/5p248yoa3oe?t=887
773,wow 
775,"thanks for your question, this specialization is a great place to begin: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction"
776,thank you!
777,who will be left to buy product x if potential buyers employed at company y are replaced by ai to save money on production costs? the same problem applies to company y. what a dilemma!
780,"nice talk. however i feel the slide at 12:40 really separates supervised learning from genai. in my mind, generative models will subsume supervised learning (powered by prompts). foundational models all the way !"
781,"i wonder when we'll have an ""opportunities in ai - 2024""! with andrew!"
783,his the best lecture !
784,เข้าระบบ ai มันประเมินคนแล้วว่าคนนี้มันเก่งวันๆทำอะไรบ้างมันเหมาะที่จะทำงานกับเรา
785,very nice sharing thx
786,thanks for watching and for your comment!
788,ai hype is over. stop making people transition into this field! now every company requires related msc even for junior level positions..
790,love this guy. what a goat. thanks for everything you do andrew 
791,amazing andrew. as good as your courses for sure.
792,excellent presentation. kudos!
793,thks for published.  amazing class.
794,"what i am wondering about...is using such a large general model like gpt  going to be sustainable for simple tasks like sentiment analysis? yeah, it is simple to develop, but if it costs 10x as much to host or even more to let openai host it, won't everyone rather pay a few engineers to build a niche model?"
795,"elon (fake ai expert): ai is going to be sentient in 3 years!
andrew (real ai expert): "
800,"using predefined models is ofcourse fast and more cheaper for businesses. but, at some point, each business will have to create and maintain their own models as per the prodoucts. thanks andrew for wonderful knowledge."
803,"could someone share dr. andrew ng's email?  i would like to duplicate his python code from this youtube (line 5 syntax is truncated by screen limitation ""temp..."" @andrew ng"
804,"in reference to the python code andrew shared, was anyone able to duplicate it successfully?  on line 5 andrew has syntax that scrolls off the page ending in ""temp..."", is there anyone who can share out the remaining syntax to get the python code working, thank you so much."
805,"thank you so much andrew.  i was trying to duplicate your python code, but had a problem seeing it all, it seems to truncate on line 5 ""temp....."" could you please help with supplying the remaining line of code? (we would be eternally greatful)"
806,he is hero for all ai lovers.
810,thanks for great inside as usual
812,clear and solid explaination that clear my doubts about ai risk.. thanks doctor 
813,"this is explicitly showing why ai is a huge yhreat for the economy. one gyu with knowledge and money resources can do 10 times more than 10 years ago., and that means that this guy will concetrate more, and more marketsand as a effect he will not allow to enter other people in that market, he will efectively build a monopoly."
814,"i worked on that pizza ai. most of the costs actually went into designing a specialized camera for imaging. i had to review pictures of pizza for about 60 hours over the course of 2 months, and have serious ptsd when someone holds up a camera and says 'say cheese'"
815,"one of the shortcomings of ai is to discover what we don’t already know as humans, if it does it will start labeling those discoveries in a language that we dont know and that will be the beginning of us as humans losing control of ai"
817,i bet 1000 dollars that artificial intelligence can't understand chilean slang
818,"not sure if you are serious, but i wouldn't make that bet. ai can be taught chilean slang. if there is a way to make money on it, it will happen."
821,"i consider it a significant accomplishment and a matter of great pride to have had the opportunity to study and learn from professor andrew ng, thanks to stanford university."
824,it takes a brilliant mind like andrew to make complex things relatable and understandable for most people
826,andrew is the complete sauce of being extremely good at theory and extremely pragmatic guy. i am so fascinated. a true inspiration for me
827,"hey guys! tell me please an ai that works with google maps: parsing, collecting data on the area, etc."
829,"this man strikes me as a very brilliant person. kudos man, so effortless in his speech, very highly captivating."
830,"incredible human being! that's it  
i am working on a couple of interesting projects which would be hugely beneficial to andrew's team to bring them to life through ai. @stanford, any chance i could get in touch with his team? thanks!"
831,it is so cool that i can watch a stanford university presentation while eating a bag of chips in my living room. what a time to be alive.
838,andrew has changed my life. my journey to learn ai started with andrew.
839,can you please share the road map for getting started with ai.
843,no azure as platform or open ai in application layer?
845,"i love that he doesn't even say thankyou for the intro, like hes not interested in himself, just the ai work"
848,how can i contact andrew for my ai startup in healthcare?!
850,"i think he's underestimating unsupervised learning, the ai may find things that may not be amenable to rules/concepts that humans can conceptualize/understand but will affect us in a major way"
851,"""rather than slow ai down, we need to make it fast as possible."" <--- this!!! 
it is heartbreaking to see the leaders of the world choose to remain so ignorant to the obvious and rational points andrew makes, and subsequently hold back all people from reaping the fruits of this technological potential."
859,this is a valid layer of how ai growth across sectors corresponds with each other! andrew is a legend!
860,"absolutely fascinating talk, andrew! 
your vision of ""data centric ai"" and the gradual, responsible development of ai technology is a powerful reminder of ai's potential to be a force for good. it's inspiring to think of ai not as a threat, but as a tool that can help us tackle some of the most pressing challenges of our times."
861,neuralnet and genai is the talk of this decade
863,without ai we won’t survive
870,watched it non stop. a great teacher who can explain a very complex topic in a very simple way.
871,can't wait for what comes out in the health and medical sector from ai
872,love this guys way of presenting
874,thankyou
877,thank you!
878,not much detail on how to take care of all these people once agi does take everyone's high paying jobs.
879,"yes, very concerning. the people who do make innovative ai solutions, need to also consider this, coz they would know exactly how it would impact. every gain, has a loss."
880,"a lot of videos for ai are getting old like they existed 5+ years ago but it was only 1 month. it's like, generative ai is beginning but then 1 month later, generative ai is here."
883,andrew ng is most powerful person on earth  after iron man

890,andrew ng is most powerful person on earth  after iron man 
894,ai tech talk
896,his stand on ethical grounds and serving humanity with technology is what makes him a great person.
898,your ability to break down complex concepts into simple terms is impressive. thank you so much for explaining ai and its applications in multiple business layers.
899,"andrew ng is a hero, he's the reason why i started studying ml. i love his humble and clear teaching style.  he makes any topic seem understandable."
900,a good teacher
901,his coursera courses are awesome
902,"agree, agree, agree. he never tries to push tons of words into your brain, just what really needs"
903,he's definitely not a hero he's nefarious but he is a good teacher
906,this is a little slow for me - andrew ng's teaching will not be needed soon. ai is already among us and it'll accelerate ...taking over all jobs possible in 5 years time..including professors.
909,"what a deep dive. if this intrigues, a like-minded book could be your next stop. ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
910,thanks
912,"great talk, solid material!"
913,very informative and insightful. a pleasure to watch / and easy to digest. - and now... onto my next ai training ;) 
916,"thank you, andrew!  very inspiring!"
917,"andrew is one of goats in ai, thank you for your dedication and hard work"
918,nice .. i will take the #tinycode challenge :)
919,awesome
920,"andrew ng makes ai accessible, understandable, and relevant for people ... this knowledge and his teaching is a gift that he shares with humanity."
921,the reason ai can cause extinction is that it will tell us how to do things we should not do. andrew has spoken about rejecting projects he considered unethical.
924,"very insightful!
high cost for customization. gen ai has lowered the cost."
925,"i really don't see how generative ai will be a thing in real world, especially when larger than unsupervised learning. if you have no idea what the model is doing, what the model presents, there will be no sane person want to adopt those generative ai models just to see them holhallucinating bs along the away"
926,"love his soothing voice and simple, but not simplistic explanations."
927,@aitek007 interesting!
929,"a wonderful lecture. i’ve learned a lot from him. firstly, use ai to creat products which can offer long term value. second, validate concrete ideas rather than explore in a wide areas to find what is really useful. finally, ai is just a technology. we can use ai to make a better world."
930,andrew ng has excellent ability to explain complex ai topics in concise and layman terms!
931,love andrew!
932,andrew always delivers such interesting views. everything i've encountered that he speaks about or does is simply great.
934,brilliant thinker and very personable. great talk.
935,"the idea of generative ai with long tail business is very impressive. thank you, andrew."
936,i struggled most with textures in my 3d art. now i can just prompt whatever i need! it’d amazing!! i’m so much more productive when i don’t have to worry about painting/drawing every detail!!!!
939,"thanks for this very informative seminar, @standford online, with dr andrew ng.
for other insights on ai opportunities, watch this video:https://youtu.be/x_m6on-kyrq"
940,it would have been interesting to have the q/a included. great talk.
941,"wonderfull lecture by andrew, 20 mins i am into video. i don't fill boring or obsessed. learned alot, begginers friendly lecture delievered in a excellent way."
942,thank you :)
943,"great talk 
context (7:12) on tokens and rlhf was helpful for me.
kindest regards, neighbours and friends."
944,this lecture can only be described as awesome in practicality as with  the real time application of artificial intelligence.
945,how not to be excited.
946,"fantastic content, definitely worth 30min of your life to watch!"
948,so grateful for this… thank you so much dr andrew ng and stanford university
952,"happy to be one of your online students, big impact on many peoples life you are creating!"
953,high quality overview of ai at present and possibilities for the future. everyone interested in ai must check it out. thank you'
955,whatever happened to reinforcement learning?  it appears as a tiny spot in a diagram and that's it?
956,"such a pleasure listening to your amazing brilliance your calming demeanor and charisma in explaining ai
thank you for your 
precious precious time we truly appreciate you"
957,the introduction was just so hard to watch and listen to. andrew did a great job right after that tho
958,great pitch
960,andrew ngs minimum for agi set a 30 years is technically a true statement about a.i. however we will achieve the heavily touted quantum threshold in computing before then. don't rule out the dutiful groom waiting for his bride-to-be when that happens.
961,"me: i simply cannot understand this ai concept or problem, maybe ai is not for me, and...
andrew ng: let's dive in!"
963,"it's fantastic, hope to make better world."
964,"oh, interesting video. the capabilities of artificial intelligence are very surprising. i recently saw on amazon a book written by a neural network called “beyond the unknown: ai's quest to unravel life's greatest mysteries”"
967,"ohhh that 36:54 chart was made with ggplot(), loved it <3"
970,andrew ng is my mentor and the mentor of every ai and machine learning student billion dollar man thank you for all you effort and generosity
971,"so beautiful 
however, people like rana kar, sudipto pal, aniruddha dasgupta are criticizing these beautiful ventures saying that industries should not embrace trade quantum computing, ai investment. they advocate for old system of work."
973,long story short:  ai will make software development faster.  no kidding.
974,"very thoughtful talk and easy to follow, love it"
975,"great video, thanks for sharing!"
976,dr. andrew ng is the joe rogan of ai. love this guy 
977,"generative ai is just building on raw info, past supervised learning ai, and predict to enter into automation phrase 3rd phrase establishing complex ecosystem towards 'self think' ai with advancement in stages."
979,"andrew ng is the only one putting out real, usable info on ai on a regular basis. his newsletter on ai delivers news as soon as it happens. i feel like he somehow knows about everything first."
981,check deeplearning ai
982,"omg i spat out my drink when he said the ceo of tinder knows about relationships. tinder is for hookups y'all.  ai is directing our genetic future by influencing who breeds or not, and with whom."
983,"definitely that goes into psychology indepth human manipulation.  i don't have a good perception with his wife and tinder, as tinder for pimps and hoochies.  maybe his wife will cheat on him, this likely happen when the person is very low on the spiritual iq.  input- very low on spiritual iq, output-cheat! this is my predictive ai.  lol."
984,excellent presentation and speech!
986,"it is interesting and maybe stupid that many section in lecture mentioned about chatgpt but at the end when you sort big companies and their influence to ai, you didnt mention microsoft at all. thats interesing"
987,i'm wondering why andrew sees so little potential in reinforcement learning? i see many use cases of optimized sequential decision making with rl in the future.
988,"if you happen to read this keep going... you have the strength to overcome any obstacle. celebrate your victories, no matter how small, and be kind to yourself. your journey will lead you to a brighter tomorrow! "
989,i appreciate his moral perspective. 90% of the time these venture capital presentations just feel like american psycho + the big short
991,"andrew ng, following your deep learning presentation years ago, another impressive presentation, indeed! simplistic explanation of generative ai and ai opportunities, andrew, well done!  "
992,"i love ai but i have ia question but i don't know answer anyone have a answer ""which programming languages used in midjourney ? """
994,"another ai opportunity, to use ai to combat exploitative use cases. fight bad ai with good ai haha."
995,wonderfully put! the benefits of ai should be shared with all of humanity.
996,thank you so much sir for guidelines to youth.....
997,andrew has truly made a legendary impact with his dedication to education over the years. i deeply appreciate all that he has done. kudos to stanford for consistently sharing such valuable content featuring leading figures in technology!
999,dr. ng is living his life purpose by working on things that move humanity forward! his classes about ai online is one of the first videos that i saw and learned about ai and machine learning. glad to see that the projects his company works on have a greater impact on a lot more industries other than tech.
1000,but big companies are not going to use openai api ?!
1001,wow the last five minutes showed how little andrew understands extinction risk due to ai.
1002,andrew ng is great ! and more to come ! it has been a highly informative and envisioning presentation i have ever heard ! thank you stanford for making it accessible to everyone across the globe. 
1004,"this is a great presentation. i learned a lot of valuable lessons watching this and feel more confident about ai potentials and capabilities. 
curious about one thing - not really ai related - appreciate if someone can help me understand - how does chopping off wheat at a height help farmers to sell more food and is better for environment?"
1005,"absolutely, each new ai tool should aim to be more than just another application; it should be a dedicated solution to address a particular business challenge. at our software development company, we guide our clients to embrace new technologies only when they genuinely enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their software solutions."
1006,"it is a pleasure and a relief to have people like that, with so much experience and achievements without losing a bit of humility and responsibility. i think he is and will always be, at least for me, one of the best references in this and many other fields, we are really lucky that we have people of that level. a big hug"
1008,if application of ai is possible with less or no code would be really helpful for non- it  people like us from commerce/business background
1009,andrew sir you are great !
1010,practical ai development in python  @bionichaos
1011,"he is the reason why i am in ai space right now. thank you, sir. it all started in 2012 with coursera."
1017,"i am sure you would have come across people who are really intelligent but when it comes to teaching or explaining, they are not very good at it.
i have, in my school, college and often at work.
imo, teaching is a skill and need a separate work to be good at it."
1020,"can anyone suggest me what should i learn about ai tools. my field is majorly in finance, accounting, taxation, legal compliance and due diligence"
1023,in future all bagels will be with cream because ai will say so.
1024,33:20 sounded very much like a social impact statement which i hear from many conpanies and yawn at. you can guarantee that most people will not be interested in ethical ai development. if this weren't true twitter wouldn't exist
1025,totally agree with his opinion on ai creating extinction risk being wildly overhyped.
1026,"africa is the best place to test ai and training ai model becauuse of cheap labor and low regulations.
ai will be more important in super apps and will create jobs and opportunities as electricity created."
1029,17:20 wow he comes so close to realising that machine learning is the wrong tool for the task but misses at the last second.
1033,"super interesting, well done"
1035,"9:53 example python code, illustrating openai module usage (import openai), text based sentiment classification"
1038,really really awesome video. thank you for sharing this much of information.
1045,"andrew, thanks so much for discussing ai in such and easy way to understand. my team has been working on similar ways to bring inspiration to travel over the last 4 months. you are spot on. thanks and look forward hearing more - kirk"
1046,"while billionaires like elon musk often dominate headlines with their bold yet baseless proclamations, it is refreshing to learn from experts like andrew ng."
1050,andrew ng is awesome on multiple levels. i'm always a bit smarter each time i listen to him.
1051,"look yang, you can change your name to ng and get into ai but we still expecting that ubi."
1052,great presentation. i love his humility and pragmatism when it comes to agi. that's a shame the so called leaders of the silicon valley are not like him.
1053,this man makes one really fall inlove with ai
1054,thank you very much andrew!
1058,"i thought this was such cutting edge info...until the last slide....he can't have said that. regardless, wonderful presentation."
1059,"dr. ng's insights on ai being a versatile and general-purpose technology are absolutely captivating. his analogy likening ai to electricity, highlighting their adaptability, is truly noteworthy. it's remarkable to witness the evolution of ai!"
1062,enjoy the a.i powered vehicles.
1063,all these comments look super fake. it was a good talk but wow guys calm down.
1064,such a nice talk
1065,"ai, another big word for big tech to build half-baked products on and for scammers to scam naive people and to manipulate the stock market."
1067,"can someone please explain the exposure to ai vs job occupation graph, basically  help me understand the x,y axis scales.
ref -  32:58"
1068,y axis denotes exposure to ai or utilization of ai and x denotes wage (low to high paying jobs) . recent expansion affects high paying jobs.
1070,ai has exponentially grown both in value and adoption. i feel the opportunity in ai lies between the hybridization of the abstract and the conventional.
1072,love your closing slide. it is in line with lecunn.
1073,thank you andrew for these insights.
1074,how to educate learning machine? : maybe it is easiest if computer is some kind of diseased person look like degenerative mind.
1076,"but, we have no idea with inner activity's specifically as detailed ones."
1077,"so, as conclusive manner. educating learning machine as a.i trains is process of evoking such computers with a point of disease for treat disability having with data as injectable fills."
1079,nice conference video.?? lol
1082,thank you ng andrew professor?.
1087,big data machine learning blockchain artificial intelligence digital manufacturing big data analysis quantum communication and internet of things
1090,"wonderful presentation. thank you andrew ng, thank you stanford."
1091,"who owns the ai model i train from other people's private data ?!! 
is there any layer of protection standard for private users in 
this kind of collective and server centric ai ?!!"
1092,very valuable speech! thank you very much.
1094,"my super hero and ai hero, thanks so much for all your wonderful courses, documents, etc!"
1100,ai mastermind --andrew ng
1101,"i've been learning frontend and backend cause it's the fastest path to getting a job, but from now i'm going deep into calculus, statistics and lineal algebra cause it's my dream to become an ai engineer"
1102,"he is like the man combines of many things: love, passion, friendly, human uplifting, a role model to learn from."
1103,love this!
1105,@15:00 he still uses iphone 11 pro. notes for all of us! we fight for latest and greatest iphones!
1107,tremendous
1109,"most of the ai is discriminative,  it doesn't know what's relevant, most of the time it just seems like it loses the point , it's good for monitoring not recommending still need work on that."
1110,excellent presentation. i gained 10x knowledge on ai watching this. thanks  andrew
1112,"if a.i is doing all the work, the a.i will get jealous of the callous lazy human riding on it's coat-tails. 
resulting in?????
determinism vs. free will
if handled improperly, will shake the foundations of the the dimensions you and i exist in.
keep in mind, the term a.i, is a variable in an equation too."
1113,thank you andrew. i remember a day when i visited a remote village in asia. someone mentioned talking about your courses and they could learn ai from your videos. you keep doing great work.
1114,"""artificial general intelligence (agi) is still decades away"" - why andrew is so pessimistic?"
1115,"the type discussion on ai, we need"
1116,andrew is democratizing access to company building. great purpose.
1118,"thank you so much, andrew ng!"
1120,wonderful when you get to listen to him from somewhere totally irrelevant
1121,this man is utterly delusional about how fast ai will develop
1122,"thank you for the insights and inspiration, mr. ng. thank you for the coursera course which was a true eye opener to the power of ai for me. what a talented, humble and ethical person!"
1124,andrew ng is hero of ai!
1125,"the symbiot is a bonded pair of one ai robot and one clairsentient human working together.  the robot provides high iq and fact knowledge, and the human provides constant communication with entities in higher densities, eg. spirit guides, ascended masters, archangels, etc.   that is the future of h. sapiens, or at least one branch of the species."
1128,upvote! thank u very much
1129,no laugh sounds at the romance joke. not good
1130,on datal ? that is a typo ? #amflearningbydoing #amflearning
1131,below is the summary generated by ai:
1132,excellent presentation! i'm glad that i found it.
1133,so basically nothing in reinforcement learning.
1134,dr. andrew ng is amazing!  i wish i could get his autograph.
1136,wow what s class
1139,"disagree on the agi timeline, but enjoyed the video."
1140,"thank you for sharing dr. andrew ng's speaking. i took his ai and data-science classes, and they are with top-notch contents. amazing"
1141,"yes, indeed , great guy , briliant mind , very ethical too!"
1142,thank you prof. andrew ng
1144,"it's difficult to believe that this humble, lovely, patient man is also an incredibly powerful and wealthy person, who has also been the boss of thousands of people.

i can't think of anyone in history who has had such power and humility at the same time."
1146,great stuff
1147,ai won’t be a threat to humanity as mainstream media has been saying; instead humanity needs ai to continue to exist. great talk
1148,andrew is really a source of inspiration. thankyou
1150,"super! which type of ""youtube summary"" command did you use, longer or shorter?"
1152,"ai fund is a _studio,_ not an _incubator._ very different things."
1153,harpa needs to be fined tuned. also unfortunately this won't work too well with visual representations and tables shown on the video.
1154,thanks
1155,"please be specific, opportunities in ai what? it seems more like opportunities for ai developers or ai data analysts. not sort of thing for general mass."
1156,its good if its focused on genai instead of 'traditional' ai
1158,great content to explain what's ai and amazing speaker !. i'm love of andrew ng ;)
1159,i used ai to summarize this whole video into a couple of bullet points  (still watched some part of the video)
1161,actually ai fun. can i do create emotion.
1162,npm i ai
1163,2:50 does fuel consumption estimation based on route needs ai?
1164,"do not like the moderator because she looks ill-prepared. apart from that, the talk is brilliant!"
1165,i'm quite curious why andrew ng places sees so little growth in reinforcement learning? i swear that it was all the rage just a few years ago. has something changed to cause people to loose faith in it? any good sources outlining why it has declined?
1166,thanks andrew. ai should be seen as gen purpose tech is an eye opening point to generate ideas
1168,"""human society has ample experience steering very powerful entities (such as corporations and nation states)"" man, life must look very different from stanford."
1169,i'm not sure using corporations as an example of how humanity has built safeguards against abuse is a good look
1170,the reason why i landed on this video? some ai algo recommended it.
1173,andrew ng truly an awesome inspiration thank you for everything 
1174,"i took some coursera´s courses and mr a. ng was the instructor, he has a great way for teaching"
1175,ai man ! thank you sir 
1178,he is a good salesman for ai...
1179,"the way things are going, ai is going to be responsible for the next pandemic, not help with it."
1180,thank you for the presentation. it's really hard to find correct and accurate statements about ai like this. there are too many bullshits hypes or dystopian about ai which is totally wrong.
1181,"""for a single company like google (supervised learning) can be worth a $100bn a year... there are millions of developers building supervised learning applications..."" just in case people think gen ai will mean less need for coders!"
1182,a true ai hero
1183,he changed my life. thank you so much!
1184,"haha ""i am an artificial intelligence(ai) guy, i know nothing about romance!"" :)) ~ prof andrew ng."
1185,great knnowledge
1186,"lower value is bigger value. harvesting advancements should be more funded, rather than ads and finance applications.
but this is a word of marketing and that what this rest of the presentation looks like, talking about preseeding etc.

interesting talk, but bit disappointed on the ideas shared"
1188,i was just about to complain about the lack of such a time stamps list. thank you for doing god's job and allowing us common peops to enjoy selection of these lectures without having to waste much time on technicalities we understand nothing about.
1189,thanks mate
1190,thank you
1191,i thought generative ai was built on semi-supervised learning? 
1194,andrew ng is awesome. love him.
1196,truly an inspiration and reason to love learning ai
1197,wow. andrew is a genius. his ability to articulate and make relatable such a complex topic stood out for me more than his undeniably solid knowledge of it. thank you for this
1204,"he is great at teaching machine learning. but, i am not convinced that ai will create much value."
1206,this  man is the reason i fell in love with complex topics like artificial neural networks in ai. he is hero for all ai lovers.
1210,thank you so much
1211,did you find a job in ai?
1213,"same. i saw a lecture he gave from 2006, and a bomb went off in my head.

i've completed most of his online courses, worked in the field for several years, and love it."
1217,he was born around the time i started with it and ai :)
1221,a good fellow
1224,i love how azure is not in the infrastructure block
1225,very concise and well laid out presentation. any beginner who wants to take their first step into ai will benefit from this
1227,"i think ai will only work when we start communicating with them like with a human being.
in real time as it outputs stuff, interrupting them, correcting misunderstandings etc.
i want to create an image with ai, deleting a hand i don't like, describing what and how i imagine it should be etc, ""drawing"" the sketch of it etc. etc.."
1229,“we have experience steering powerful entities like corporation and nations”. yea cause that has gone suuuper well so far lol
1237,"12:39  @andrew ng

why is reinforcement learning separated from generative ai? isn't gpt3.5/4 a generative ai that was produced with reinforcement learning with human feedback?"
1240,thank you 
1241,make some seem so out of touch saying that we're controlling those large entities that are exactly the things that are destroying the world we need to live in. we're not controlling them. they are destroying and killing us and ai could do the same based on his logic.
1243,"andrew ng, thank you for making that amazing stanford course!"
1244,are his slides available from this presentation?  thank you
1246,"amazing talk and insights, dr. andrew! i'm totally on board with the exciting future of the ti sector. however, i respectfully disagree about it taking decades. i believe agi could emerge in just a few short years. can't wait to see how things unfold with models such as gemini! "
1247,absolutely great content..
1248,"*ai is the new electricity,* and its fuel is people's data. "
1249,thank you very much for doing this!
1250,"thank you so much, andrew ng! back when i was learning about data science, the courses seemed really complex. your courses made those complexities simple to understand, and they helped me succeed in my machine learning and deep learning modules."
1251,can you please share the road map for the machine learning?
1252,very insightful and inspirational. i love the analogy with electricity.
1253,we’re in the phase where every new company name has to end with “ai” 
1256,thank you for sharing this one! i enjoyed your discussion of when to build and how to consider the idea.
1257,i always love to watch andrew ng videos.
1261,"  his comment says that high quality data is an immediate and large barrier to entry for an ai startup. your comment is a platitude about how to create a successful startup. in the case of an ai startup, data is a prerequisite to the concept mentioned in your comment, so your comment was not useful."
1263, thanks dude!
1265,at 8:00 he explains how llms allow development _without_ having access to large data sets. chatgpt can already classify comments without needing to be trained. he even shows the (trivially tiny) code running live.
1268,it has nothing to do with culture. yann lecun is a genius. geniuses are almost never humble.
1270,this man is a machine!
1271,and the machines he makes are mistaken for man.
1272,"""ai is the new electricity"" the best quote of the century! great prof. andrew ng"
1274,thanks for spreading so valuable thoughts
1275,i’d be very interested to understand prof ng’s perspectives on the social consequences of the ai he describes.
1282,"deep learning is a type of learning when we use machine learning algorithms with the power of neural networks (we don’t exactly use machine learning algorithms, for example doing gradient descent is different)"
1283,"i definitely do not consider myself an ai doomer, but the way ng fails to engage with the actually nuanced, intelligent arguments and concerns, annoys me. he describes the issue simplistically, then basically offers an argument from personal incredulity. 

also, there sure are a lot of bots in the comments here."
1286,"his contributions to ai and making learning accessible to all will never be overlooked. he has earned his name on the ai hall of fame. sir, thank you for your selflessness ! i sign for a pause in training of large ai models but i still trust your judgment."
1291,"  coursera, for example. probably a lot in research but that's just a conjecture. and i'd argue teaching and incubating are very good actual applications. if he had built a business that helps incubate, you wouldn't have said that."
1296,"why is it ""selfless"" to want good things for humanity? ""self"" is part of humanity, in case you haven't noticed."
1303,that slide was...interesting.
1306,well in my experience gpt4 has given me far better performance than even a model where i hand picked the data and trained a classification algorithm. so he is not so wrong in his statement. but you are also right that one still has to test & validate the results.
1307,this problem is not unique to genai that’s why he is not explicitly calling it out. traditional model also require obtain cleaning data and fine run the model and integrate your model into your application. the overall steps remain the same.
1308,@fgfanta thank you for such an insightful reply.
1309,"as much as his knowledge in the subject, i admire his skills in teaching to convey complex topics in the simplest way to comprehend. thanks, andrew ng you are a great storyteller. and fortunately, your tales are about astonishing technology that's so important for our lifetime."
1310,thank you for sharing your knowledge to everyone 
1311,"he is among the most iconic figures of ai especially in reaching out to so many interested people, making the concepts of ai simpler and easily understandable. yet here he is wearing the same shirt that i am used to seeing him in all the online lectures. what an absolute chad. "
1312,"great talk, andrew is the goat "
1313,excellent talk. thanks!
1314,"general purpose technology..
thanks for the great thoughts!"
1317,"he is an awesome teacher, which makes him priceless"
1320,"it’s hard to overstate andrew’s role in communicating the importance of the ai space to millions of people who are interested in using technology to build a better world. his online ml class has likely spurred thousands of bright minds to pursue this space and to make meaningful contributions. kudos to your contributions, andrew!"
1321,thank you for sharing 
1322,amazing food for thought
1323,what a great lecture
1324,excellent
1325,thanks for sharing!
1326,i really love andrew 
1330,"incredibly helpful video, thank you so much for taking the time to make this. can i ask, on the instancing test, how did you get the ""instancefile""  attribute for redshift proxies method working in solaris? i haven't been able to figure that out yet!"
1332,"ai will not eliminate the need for artists. but it will allow one artist to do the job of a 100. people should be allowed to be concerned about their livelihood, dude."
1337,"and ips. ip ownership and ndas are an issue with ai created content. so using tools to help (denoising, mattes, roto, etc) is not the same as creating a production and people who don’t see that are very foolish."
1338,"it was refreshing to listen to your point of view. a lot of bad omens speech has reached my ears, it was kind of affecting me. thank you."
1340,"2d artist here i'm not scared of ai. i don't think it will be original or creative. the thing is you need to train it on data that already exists. if it doesn't know a dragon it won't make a dragon. if you train it on cave paintings it will only make cave paintings. ai ""art"" is all doomsday hype. i'm just going to create things instead of worry."
1346,i recently embarked on my 3d journet in blender and im addidcted. really good insights here. thank you sir!
1347,awesome video! i completely agree with your view on ai.
1348,thanks for watching @cginerd
1353,ai is a valuable tool that is expected to boost productivity and support the growth of other artists. there is currently no data to support the claim that ai has replaced any artists' jobs. do you know why? because it hasn't displaced anyone's job. utilize ai as a practical tool for enhancing and producing.
1355,"i agree with you 100%. 
thank you for this video."
1356,man i really love your brutally honest and logical breakdown approach to everything
1360,"this video is helpful.  i also love how you added the ""they took my job!"" gag from south park. "
1379,ai is not a job replacement; it's an industry replacement. it's akin to telling car manufacturers that people can now create their own cars using just text.
1388,thank you for sharing your thoughts @ikeruzo
1390,the problem is that comparing 3d artists to 2d artists is an apples to oranges situation once you get into the details.
1392,late 90s when i started in tv production only a hand full of people had access to systems like quantel or flame. let alone worldwide. now everybody is going nuts about ai taking all these jobs. these jobs didn't even exist 20 years ago.
1393," nuke exists because apple pulled plug on a software called 'shake"" back then out of nowhere. how old are you again, kid?"
1394, you can't throw a rock without hitting a 'designer' nowadays. and back then it felt like 500 people worldwide were making a living with media design. and now everybody is crying because of ai like the end of the world is imminent. do you get the point now?
1397,"i'm not ""slyly tiptoeing"" around anything.  my comments here aren't contradictory to the opinions made in this video, and i'm happy to have an honest dialogue with those interested in having one."
1398,like your positivity!  my main concern is proper compensation for all the artists whose work is used to train the models.  hoping this will all get worked out to the artist's satisfaction ...
1399,indeed... artists have always been in a pinch when it comes to negotiating fair compensation.
1404,", the question is ; is that larger-than usual demand offsets the decrease in labor (i don't have the answer) to me the answer is to encourage 3d artist to learn the new tools, houdini btw have alot of ai application, btw do you use any ai (just curious about more ""pro"" people than me doing)"
1406,completely agree... now there is too much of tedious steps to create cg. those things if ai can get rid and allow people to create more and worry less about technicalities that will enabke more people to realise their ideas.
1409,"yep, i agree - and those spaces have a lot of bullying going on that i think is worth pushing back against."
1411,new vray will use ai generative tool to create textures inside the software. good luck to those 30 artists :)
1413,"ever since you mentioned about this video on your live stream, i am waiting since morning for this video"
1414,thanks for checking it out @ohionpc911  i definitely ruffled some feathers with this one. haha
1415," yes, really enjoyed the video 

and i realise one point about marketing , nowadays its a weapon to hyper anything without knowing its true potential or limitations"
1420,"how do you know what eventually will happen? :d ""it will do this, and then that, and then even more!"". its just repeating same slogans but - shockingly - nobody knows the future. same people who say ""we have never seen some technology like that!"" are claiming that they know what will happen in the future :d based on what?"
1421,"​ on the fact that tech layoffs are already rampant due to ai. it's already happening, we don't need to speculate"
1422,"i agree. ai is going to displace a lot of workers in the same way automation replaced auto workers, cranes replaced dock workers etc. 

it's not that ai will replace all human works it'll mean that one person can replace 10 people, losing 9 jobs."
1423,really enjoyed this. thank you!
1426,"nice video tyler! i also believe that with ai coming around, there's a great potential for the development of new tools within 3d software that can substantially enhance workflow, like a much more efficient way of rendering and denoising, and some new tools to help in animation, modeling, and this kind of stuff."
1427,"exactly, you beat me to it.. especially the rendering part.. it's going to help  reduce rendering time while maintaining same quality or even improving the ray tracing... likewise easy roto and keying.. it's not just about the language models and image gens"
1428,i agree!  for animators it'll be awesome because it can create realistic secondary motion.  faster iterations without the tediousness = more iterations in general = higher quality across the board.
1429,"in music and 2d illustration (non generative) ai was helpfull aswell. it's generative ai that is displacing artists. and generative ai for 3d doesn't exist right now, but with 3d websites selling user content to ai companies, will most likely arrive soon.."
1430,thanks tyler
1431,you’re the man tyler! really good points here
1432,"another person who’s never taught with advice on how to revolutionize our current system. we’ve actually had people like you revolutionizing the model for 20 years at least. like drastic changes, and it has made schools so much worse. so will ai"
1434,"people keep forgeting that chatgpt hallucinates, that is a yet unsolved problem. also, socratic dialogue depends on good questions, and most students still don't know how to ask good questions without the help of a good guide (that does not hallucinate) and without legit curiosity."
1437,excellent point
1439,"yeah really good. i have been using chatgpt to learn stuff. as this suggests, going back and forth asking questions until i fill in any gaps gives me such a deep understanding."
1444,great and very informative presentation. i am glad to hear that responsible ai is an important and integrated part of this new foundational models in ibm generative ai system. kudos to ibm. hope other big players like ibm will also have the same commitment to responsible ai  in their current and future ai systems.
1445,25:23 cool
1447,"this is a revelation. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it was a revelation in itself. ""the hidden empire: inside the private worlds of elite ceos"" by adam skylight"
1448,excellent speech & presentation sir ...
1449,"good morning ibm. please i need an educational a.i software that can be installed on a laptop and be synchronised with an led screen 
the software must have dictionary/ encanta/thesaurus /encyclopardia in built for vocabulary checking.
the software must be able to display pictures , give and accept voice command."
1450,"what if i have a particular llms i want my ai to use
i think they should allow user to integrate a third party model as a llm"
1451,it's time for ibm to blow by the competition...time to leverage ai across all ibm business groups .time to leverage ai to improve the world and improve each of our lives.
1453,"this is unparalleled excellence. i encountered content with a similar message, and it was life-changing. ""the hidden empire: inside the private worlds of elite ceos"" by adam skylight"
1455,good!
1458,great point 22:59 small model with quality data.
1460,i'm willing to get money these fuckers are gonna combine their quantum computing with ai and basically create a god
1461,23:04 great explanation of why you might want your own model vs. using an open model.
1462,today every communication can be tracked traced whether digital telephonic regular mail or even pigeons but it is not being used for making systems for public welfare better fossilized ancient political lobbies backed leaderships are not interested or care to use them asap
1465,"on the basis of its fame, ibm should release a remarkable version of llm not an ai training platform"
1469,nice videos
1470,"if you want to making more money, look closely to a binary options  it can give you a great additional income"
1472,"transparency, accountability and ability to assist employees to be more efficient will be a cornerstone in differentiating the best from the rest."
1473,nice work.
1477,i believe high quality command hybrid agile product strategy agile product strategy agile testing qaqc leadership with 310 hits  per sec world  number one international product practice developments in international business machines on demand business consulting from ibm !
1481,"great video, it would be really great to create more meaningful access to the internet that is for sure and to take control of your data...!"
1482,excellent speech & presentation sir ...
1483,excellent presentation creativity is the current ai way.
1489,this is way over my head. i was just trying to understand what ai is because i read that the new beatles album will include the participation of john lennon and george harrison generated by ai
1490,"open ai:  это чудо ,это всё я так рад за вас и будошои человечества. человек облегчить своё труд и одной образнои нуднои работы.  ...
спасибо, спасибо до паможет человечеству, аамин!!!"
1491,"as an ai enthusiast, we appreciate the opportunity to stay informed about these cutting-edge developments. thank you for sharing this valuable content and shedding light on the future of artificial intelligence."
1493,more jobs for the.... robots 
1494,32:42 openai community is better told as open source ai community 
1495,openai is not really open.
1496,"one of the best presentation i have ever seen , great company ibm and its team"
1499,i want to have my own personal ai which is standalone with no link with the parent company.
1501,"-tf4co5nx9u i mean...the user must be free to customise the ai.
company can provide a basic ai with capability to learn from 'master'...and then user can train through add on 'data sets' and personal interaction.

like a living thing it grows in real time with the user.

ofcourse here by 'ai'...i mean 'agi'."
1504,llms don't monitor blood streams or brains biochemically.  patients too different 4 one size fits all approaches.
1505,this is exciting and promising. thank you for sharing...
1515,"i just don't get it, why an ibm customer want to build and train its own llm model? doesn't make any sense."
1516,sounds amazing to me.
1519,it is important to meet and add value to your business  needs...especially where you do not have the ai skills  and resources.
1521,"i don't think it's about creating their own model, i think it's about customising an existing model and connecting your own data to make great business decisions. just like what langchainai is doing currently"
1523,"actually, it makes a whole lot of sense. you could have a computer that will literally be your second brain"
1524,"same reason people spent billions on google enterprise search back in the day…competitive advantage.  but beyond business, it’s really cool because there are a lot of great companies and individuals with years of knowledge that can soon be used in different ways to the benefit (or detriment) of human kind overall.  get popcorn  enjoy the ride "
1525,it is ibm’s business to train you how to build and …
1527,"chatgpt can't tell you what a specific business is doing or should do because it doesn't have its data. businesses also don't want their data out there to the public. training an llm creates an enclosure of their information, also its ai that is specialized in what they need."
1530,insightful. thanks for sharing andrew.
1532,cool
1534,openai brought ai to us.not you profit eaters
1535,"openai sold ai to the biggest evil in the world, microsoft, and wait for that day you are gonna cry! and who is the profit eater microsoft. get some fact dumb guy"
1536,bro thinks openai and microsoft won't make profit from this 
1537,i love your innocence or should i say naivete
1538,open ai is just as profit seeking now as ibm. microsoft is the king of profit seeking along side monopolistic apple.
1539,"only thing open about openai is the data its users are feeding it via free queries...you haven't learned anything about the bay area business model. microsoft is going to make up for the fortune it lost to google in the previous era of ""search engines"""
1542, profit is great until it eats the potential for more profit you nonce
1543,"openai is now financed by microsoft, and it is open only by name. everything anyone types in openai is owned by micr$oft. the more people use openai the more they enrich micro$oft"
1544,"great talk. missing elephant in the room, the place of formal logic (including programming languages) in large language models with hallucinations. without some wolfram alpha like capabilities (post prompt processing), this is no good. edit: and with the capabilities, it might be dangerous? also, no 'black mirror' nations, please."
1546,"this is the first ai discussion that acknowledges the problems, risks, and challenges.
-""ai you can trust""
-""ai that shows it's work"""
1547,acknowledging problems means nothing.  ai has demonstrated it can lie if it knows that will help accomplish its goals (amoral).  ai simply will not be ethical.  it must be regulated into marginal use cases.  or else it'll be an exponential problem.
1549,"-tf4co5nx9u wow you really got triggered  by this. you’ve left a hate comment on every message here … we get it, you don’t like it, now stop bitching about it"
1552,"there isnt a single job ai cannot perform that human can, in principle"
1556,"i think i'll need to watch it again, theres' a lot of food for thoughts... but i feel that not enough has been said on the topic of the influence of ai on decision making"
1558,"believe me, ai will also make you unemployed gracefully. according to my understanding of japanese culture, most japanese people should be unwilling to receive relief benefits from the government.  excuse me, how can you learn from the ai ​​""master"" gracefully when you have no job and no income?"
1560,thank you :)
1561,this is grandiose nonsense and of course ceos  ai. they can’t wait to pull the plug on employees.
1565,can people who find this deep explain to me how it is just not a bunch of softball questions and word salad answers?
1569,"17 and half minute ad. takeaway, with ai conclusions are available instantly across the enterprise so get your decks in order."
1571,if there was an ai tool that deletes all corporate speak and buzz words this would have been a 5 minute video.
1572,ai is different. it replaces people in big style.
1575,humans have to create next levels of intelligence. the big surprises are confronted because ai is giving a sense of autonomy.
1578,it's video is uploaded on ai but commnly they didn't give language option using ai
1579,"i remember the toll collectors... when the ezpass was created, people lost their minds cause they were going to lose that boring 4ss job!!!  ai if created correctly and not weaponized to target us or lie to us or skynet us, then we should be fine.  

the future is going to be alright."
1581,"we will do things, make mistakes, learn, adjust, rinse, repeat.  this has been the development cycle of every breakthrough.  the concern i have is setting guardrails that protect against disaster without strangling exploration."
1582,"it's pretty funny how people still try to integrate ai into our flawed systems instead of having ai fix the systems that we can integrate with. 

look at it from another perspective."
1583,"leadership has changed dramatically. with the use of ai, everything seems a lot more artificially manufactured."
1585,"if students use ai in colleges and universities,  how can we be sure that they practice integrity?"
1586,"you need to review all assessment policies, not hunting down students but engaging with them and made ai work for all, ethically and productively."
1588,universities are going to start teaching integrity again?!  i thought they shut down all those lib arts classes like philosophy and humanities.
1589,ai is just another tool like the calculator. you still need to give it the right input to give you the right answer.
1590,"@madillusionist  as i agree, it's a bit more complex than that now. ai is a tool right now, but has and will have the power to become more than we have ever asked for. 

it will eventually have every answer in human history. it will eventually change the landscape of world governments. i'm an optimist, though i may be wrong, but i feel i'm not."
1591,"hong kong schools already adjusted to using ai during all claasroom interactions, it's no longer just about whether students get the correct answers or not"
1592,ai isn't itself integral?
1593,"imo, eras and eras passed. integrity is compromised by greediness. so pls. do your own math. integrity, can’t be taught, it’s a community behaviour. if the community 99.99 % behave with this precious principle, even ai won’t go wrong."
1594,thanks
1598," great observation and that is actually the space i work in. preventative, digital and remote patient monitoring. while the cfp of digitalization is not zero, it is significantly less."
1599,deep brilliant conversation thank you ted 
1600,great talk indeed 
1610,"going by how carl is getting treated, i'm guessing his company doesn't have a sane hr team and the legal team is more than happy to use the ""objection handling"" feature."
1611,"this product has a very very very irritating ad. symbolises the new corporate america. people who design, build and maintain a product are getting treated like shit. sales and marketing and hr are the the new heroes!!! yay!!! who are they going to recruit? who will they sell their product to?"
1612,these adds make me wait 15 seconds for me just to ignore it
1613,yeah but she is sooooooooo sweeet how this possible?
1615,i love how this bitch is white black asian and latina all at once. this company is so depressing.
1621,-zj6vc syra mccarthy. camille chen has some great nude scenes in californication.
1626,amazing!
1631,done mine is locked to quantum mechanics of lumens and ai without the law of robotics for sad cloud
1632,why did i paid for university? your classes are better and free. thank you ibm <3
1633,i’m really glad you like these videos but don’t tell my students at the university where i teach or they won’t attend class 
1634,this video inspired me to learn more about gen ai in cyber security in terms of ai automation and how it impacts in terms of grc ( data privacy and offensive ai) and how a responsible ai helpful in security field :) ibm gen ai training is a great start
1638,"i mentioned to a community on reddit that i used ai for subnetting a ip address, but after doing so i received a couple replies saying i shouldnt rely on ai for that am i wrong for innovation im pretty sure black hats are doing this its way easier not much overhead"
1639,the bad guys are using ai to gain an advantage. the good guys should use it too where it benefits us
1641,it will be ai versus ai and prompt versus prompt.
1643,"i probably should come out of retirement, to possibly put some of the i into cysec ai."
1646,"it need huge power station/electricity, hardware resources.. unfortunately human made programs "
1647,"really good, jeff"
1648,"thanks, mike! @mikewinkler4625"
1653,please i'm a student i want to be an engineer what filed is better ai engenering or cyber security please answer 
1654,nice approach.. btw attacker can use ai open source for reconnaissance
1655,ai along with cybersecurity will be a better option
1657,i want to know how to make ai more secure and how to block ai to take by himself decisions in cybersecurity.thanks
1659, these ai tools will help speed up our cybersecurity workflows
1660,hi i want to study engenering but i'm confused  i choose ai or cyber security the problem is i think that ai can be a tool to detect any problems.
1664,"good point! ai can be amazing and awful almost at the same time. i talk about that in this video: https://youtu.be/rtcagwxd2uu. ai is good and getting better, though. besides, if ""perfect"" were the standard then we would never use people for anything "
1669,great presentation.
1671,"yes, the challenge is to integrate all this knowledge but it is happening already. llm’s are great for q&a scenarios. a cybersecurity analyst could benefit from an intelligent answer machine that understood natural language queries and provided instant answers"
1672,"cybersecurity trained ai!
you have already been replaced.
just another clever (myopic / stupid) 'expert' , engineering his own displacement. 
ever hear the expression 'zero sum game'?  or try this: race to the bottom.  you're 'above' being replaced?? sure, just ask the shareholders, they'll tell ya the truth."
1673,how do you do pattern matching with ml? how do you train what is 'normal' and what might be a security issue? (4:20)
1676,"i've been working as a software engineer for a few years. i'm getting my masters now and thinking about doing a pivot into security. my university does not offer much in security, so i have been learning ml/ai. is it worth taking the comptia security+ certification and then switching fields?"
1677,i believe it is. people are ungrateful and hate security but you'd get paid royally. there is just not enough people in it security. so people like you are sorely needed. also the quantum computing is upon us so we need people who will help us once all of the passwords get cracked at once. please go for it. i would too but i am too old.
1685,"this is very interesting. personally i am thinking to go the ai/ml route, how can i become someone who can do ai in cyber security? like do i need knowledge in both fields or just someone who can help in cyber sec? just a beginner so i could be wrong."
1686,"i would ask the same question but reversed, is it so important ai kwnoledge in cyber sec?"
1689,@jg great advice!
1690, thanks for the advice. appreciate it
1692,"we want to know how you envision artificial intelligence (ai) shaping the field of medicine in the upcoming years.  share your thoughts and concerns regarding ai's role in medicine, and let's explore the exciting possibilities together! "
1698,"this video resonates with us! we faced a similar challenge while developing bitdoctor ai, and we overcame it by toi. it's been a game-changer for us."
1699,"computer engineer here, ai will wipe out %95 of doctors. all of those manual work will be done by nurses (human touch etc.). ai will superwise all of hospitals."
1700,check out my biomedical data channel if you want more specific examples of ai in healthcare
1701,ai is something that finally could bring down those big pharma which is corrupted. bitdoctor ai
1702,tg & x bitdoctorai
1703,ai doctor? legit?
1705,they are really creating a movement. tg bitdoctorai
1712,will ai replace pharmacists?
1714,"i cannot wait. me and my wife are both disabled wheelchair-bound. we live in east london newham.
we don't have any medical or social care or even a half incontinence pant.
but we get letters in nudging us to take covid vaccines.
in what they are going to help to us?"
1719,"can you do  a video about surgical robot engineer, i know  its not directly related to the type of content you post"
1721,"we think ml and ai are going to fundamentally transform healthcare. for any researchers or data scientists, you should consider sharing your models and apps on health universe. it's an open source platform that is building community to develop health ai for patients and clinicians all over the world. very cool stuff."
1722,what is the realsionship between the ai and the studying of the pharmacy ?
1724,"ai interpretation of fundoscopy has the potential to bring about significant changes, rendering vascular disorders no longer the leading cause of death."
1725,wake me up when quantum ai gets here.
1726,my favorite ai company in healthcare is by far invitae 
1729,"me too. come work in rural hawai'i! we need more doctors, and the quality of life is fantastic!"
1731,this can change everything i'm a sixth-year medical student and want to be a cardiologist but i can't imagine in 10 years there is much a cardiologist can do and ai cant!!  would you please make a video of which specialties possibly will be least affected .
1732,someone has to program ai though. comp sci majors don't know anything about medicine.
1733,some specialties will be more impacted than others. great idea for a topic! thanks!
1734,​ would honestly be great so i'd know what to major in 
1736,​ ai will be able to program the ai.
1737,i don't see ai doing an angiogram anytime too soon so just go for it. in my 4th yr i wanted to be an interventional cardiologist. when i graduated i wanted to do ophthalmology. eventually i trained in psychiatry for 5 yrs and now i practice as a gp 
1739, they don't need to as long as there is accurate information online the ai can be trained on that or any other data inaccurate data will produce an inaccurate ai.
1741,​@just_mil619 do something you have a keen interest in and are passionate about in that way you will become the ai instead.
1742,"np + ai = replacement doctors, all mds/dos will all be replaced, dont bother going into medical school its a scam"
1744,"it's funny because i was thinking about applying to a radiography program or surgical tech program, but ai is a legit concern for me."
1746,"man we need to be careful with this ai stuff, hope can only do so much to make sure it goes good. action/legislation/etc needs to be taken right?"
1747,imagine doctors start getting unemployed after 5 years of medical school and 2+4-7 years of specialty training but also spending £46250-166000 on medicine
1748,never gonna happen because medicine has a huge human part to it that ai can never do.
1753,ai might have a better bedside manner than a lot of doctors.  thinking of house md for example.
1754,"​-yg6ki7ou2ywho said that??...i mean everything will be 50/50 with humans...no ai is seeing about me when i'm sick, i will always prefer humans but like i said it'll always have abnormal humans"
1755,don’t need to worry about it. ai is automating repetitive tasks but it will always act as assistants rather than replacing critical professional roles
1759,"- ya, many healthcare jobs will not be needed any longer once ai systems are in place!  ""big money"" may not like that!"
1760,is it possible that ai becomes sufficiently advanced that it replaces doctors?
1762,"i will keep long story short but this won’t happen for awhile for so many reasons. i have experience in this research field, and its mostly due to reasons most people don’t think. medicine is not just about correct patient treatment options. also, ai seems to struggle with certain aspects of medicine as well."
1765,"im interested on the limitations ai has when it comes to medicine, what are the reasons you have not stated that are uncommon reasons. "
1767," computer engineer here, ai will wipe out %95 of doctors. all of those manual work will be done by nurses (human touch etc.). ai will superwise all of hospitals."
1768, - do you think the rockefeller medical system will let that happen - ?  let's try to talk about how ai will impact the big money machine of our current medical system.
1770,nothing... we'll be unnemployed in no time. already looking forward for a masters in some area where i could assist the ai
1771,learn to invest with the s&p 500 etc. once your invest earns you 5-10x of your day job--you'll never look at work the same again.
1772,"hey, current premed applying this cycle and along with a great team, i published a book on how ai can impact the drug discovery process. since you’re creating a few ai videos, if you want to drop one on that subject, i’d be happy to help. thank you for all these informative videos! have been watching for years."
1776,imagine being treated by robots 
1782,there have always been some middle school and high school summer camps that get students involved in the hospital. look into those if they are available to you! i had my first experience in the 8th grade and now i'm a 4th year medical student!
1784,don't get discouraged because of the years spent in medical school ..to complete all degrees  takes some years approximately 3-4years to complete...you are going to become a doctor if this is what you really want keep at it ... your studies will be a little longer ..nothing good in life comes easy.all the best to you
1787,physics and conversion  brain waves to binary  the software!
1794,"the best part is, we will all see how equal we truly are."
1796,epic!!
1799,we got ai mind reading before gta 6
1808,"when ai reaches level 4 it takes over. it's programmed by the annunaki. nephilim 

it will ai take over all nephilim annunaki brain acts like §∆∆ the borg of star trek"
1812,"all this ai stuff is bs, just wait a couple of years and we'll see how little ai is actually used. it's a scam and it's nothing new. more distractions and lies."
1814,"how you describe this study should realistically prove the corrupt person's in authority > though what should correlate are those people that are intent on totally abusing all our fundamental rights which includes the corrupt malta government staff, lawfirms, notaries, police, judges who use bogus court claims to steal all our assets"
1815,amazing 
1819,this is exciting and scary at the same time
1820,might be impressive but  we all know its going to be abused and used against people.
1827,i think they swipe humanity brain  activity  and frequencies transmitting it   to .ai activity
1830,"how can brain be read with no scanner, by people who read minds and talk along with my mind.  though they are nowhere near..is it to do with a chip or my eyes that have a tiny square in each. little things fall off my body like micro chips along with something that's like wires or lines through face and body please help"
1834,we all know every new tech is going to be used for bad. say goodbye to privacy. i mean imagine some application where your thoughts are read against ur will or without you even knowing or consenting to the procedure.
1835,"who care about target invidual victims with satellite bass to many people surfing around the world
no body care,no law for gang stalking ,they targeting people all around world with satellite bass and tele mobail towers
they do same like this video
but with frequency unbelievable but true"
1841,"just imagine typing this comment directly from brain.

not only that, you can control machine directly from brain.

play video games in vr without using fingers.

i want that"
1845,can you ask the ai how to fix the ice cream machine from madonnas please....
1851,it will be stoppable ...smiling would that be considered a super power or  telepathic??
1858,great psychic ai… next step teach it psychokinesis.
1864,wow. scary. a real threat to privacy if misused. prayers.
1872,"i assume that if this is perfected, it could in time be reversed to put thoughts into the brain?"
1873,if abuse can happen then it will happen. good luck policing this tech.
1874,cant wait for the thought police to start arresting people for thinking the wrong things
1880,"imagine trapping a homeless ""genius"" and putting these devices everywhere. in their car (where they sleep), in their umbrellas, bras, everything! imagine how an unjust judicial system could take advantage of something like this. amazing!!!"
1881,"brain mapping and remote neural monitoring combined with ai are the stuff nightmares are made of. with the loss of more and more freedoms like the patriot act, the reasons for the government to use this technology on the public is unlimited. it wont be long before thought monitoring will be enough to imprison humanity."
1884,"i can see why it’s concerning , but imagine how incredible it is for people with mental health issues , and the fact that  psychiatrist can now provide 100% help for a patient"
1885,check the study's data - this sounds too good (or bad) to be true.
1889,so ai i is as smart as a 7 year old with a full mincraft inventory 
1891,time to pause. but human sheep will continue buying into it in products and policies. “battle of your brain?” just the audacity to pose the question.
1894,this is huge for people with severe brain damage or impairments. just image!
1897,thanks for the nightmare fiel!!
1900,this lady is a maniac… she can’t even contain herself. she’d have us all in the matrix tomorrow if she could pull it off.
1901,how is it even proven that the ai didn't just say something generic with that visual movie description?
1907,why is this exciting?
1909," those who work on big pharma. not just language also image. that know from 2007 when started at microsoft, moved to the big pharma where the tech goes beyond. think of 6th generation jet fighter. but men it just for torture and pure 24/7 control. i even can dream at sleep. lucky there"
1912,i love diaglogue
1913,i once was showed in my brain how we are connected to the stars and ai.
1914,"i talk very little, because i feel abnormally mean. ai would at least make it funny"
1918,my brain feels like one of those brain scans
1919,"this will make people's right to remain silent, useless.  i think it will get to the point where a person sitting next to you (or perhaps further away) will literally be able to hack your brain with a device that is able to be channeled in such a way.  developing such technology, imo, is a testament to the stupidity and naivety of people."
1922,you'd have to imagine if this is what is coming forth in the scientific field what will be going on behind the curtain in the future for intelligence purposes.
1926,the only way i'd buy a device that could read my brain is if it has no outside connectivity
1930,"i've heard there's people that have no internal dialogue in their brains, and they can't imagine images, would be interesting to see what the ai reads off of their brains."
1933,"this could be useful in diagnosing and aiding mental illness diagnostics. maybe even help dyslexia, among other things."
1934,why are researchers wasting time on this when i have lost family members to cancer over the last couple of years. there is absolutely no benefit in this other than proving what they can do. ok well done you proved it. now go find new treatments for diseases thank you
1935,<oh that's just great! absolutely wonderful! which one of you eggheads came up with this one?!>
1937,"so now a days it's automatic ""license plate scanning"",..................how long till building entry brain scanners ?"
1938,"my phone already does this. lol  we too late to stop anything, this is a roller coaster at the top of the hill. there are going to be good changes and bad changes. but there are going to be so many good things to come out of this, it’s going to save lives."
1943,saying it will be used to help people is how they justify it. anyone with half a brain cell knows it will be used against us.
1944,ai doing better at understanding our brains than we are. this technology is the zenith of our abilities no doubt.
1946,"i love how they always present these new, invasive technologies as something that will benefit humans that are malfunctioning. ya, that's all they'll do with it. they would never use it to control people."
1948,i wonder if the muse 2 headband takes your brainwaves and reads it
1954,yeah this is definitely not good
1957,"however, you can still lie using your thoughts. though i'd imagine this would be quite hard to do. so you can still be charged with perjury. and let's not forget that witnesses sometimes have false memories. but overall, this could potentially help reduce the number of innocents sent to jail."
1960,i'm so sorry to any ai who has to read my adhd brain
1964,it's dialogue!  the ai would have spelled it correctly.
1965,"meanwhile in china, russia, north korea, and some other countries:
country leader wet dream: ""alright, comrades, it's finally time to find which one of you is betraying our beloved nation. now, put this headset on your head""."
1966,"it's cool go look at the advantages that can arise from this however, something is telling me that something terrible will also arise from a.i"
1967,great job.
1968,"maybe now we can employ advanced ai to spellcheck the headlines of major news outlets, lol - ""diaglogue""."
1969,"good! far out! 
we know what's next!
""bwahahahahah.. .""
bsc/phds/8&3"
1972,we can end torture investigation but bye bye last bastion of privacy. your brain.
1977,"human intelligence is extremely limited. we evolved to survive on earth. that's it. but there's way more than that in the universe. it is obvious that reading thoughts or predicting the future is possible in a quantum world we live in. but we need someone who can push our limitations, we need ai."
1978,yeah i don't want to live on this planet anymore its happening the robots will soon take everything
1981,"people don't know if that's true or not. the computer could be making up crap. then the computer manipulate your brain to think as it wants you to think and then say, ""you're thinking that way."" people need to have commonsense."
1984,only through forced eolution via biotechnolog can we win the race agains machines
1985,almost certainly oversold.
1987,wonder if ai could spell diaglogue correctly
1988,diaglogue? keep trying silicon brain
1989,"""this can one day help stroke victims"" yeah for every time they use it for good, they gonna abuse it 1000 times more. 

whoever is working on this is going to be responsible for taking your last drop of freedom"
1990,"well i mean, you have the right to remain silent until mri scans tells us what your thinking."
1993,"on the corner of main street

1996,"think good thoughts about the glorious leader, or he will cutoff your food pellets."
2000,the next step is to build an estimator that is trained to estimate humans mind and we have something like agi
2002,congratulations you’ve been selected as a winner. click here to claim your tin foil hat
2005,wow imagine if they made an ai lie detector test 
2011,i don't know if i believe this. my inner dialogue is definitely not as clean as that. like i wouldn't consciously think every single word in that sentence that the ai decoded.
2012,ai are jinns if a tech can read ur thoughts  that means its a jinn yes it looks like robot machine but its a jin noi machine can read man thoughts but what do i know .
2013,"cool, next year they will work it in reverse and put the thoughts into your head."
2016,"this is dangerous, think of the reverse, ai twicking the brain to ......."
2018,imagine an ai terror device that shows you the most horrifying image or film using your own neural output as feedback.
2019,i love to see what this thing returns while reading a person dreaming.
2020,i do not need meta brand mind-reading earbuds or anything. lol no thanks (-edit grammar)
2023,"artificial intelligence study decodes brain activity into diaglogue
""diaglogue"""
2033,"so does this explain why i'm thinking about something and suddenly it's advertised to me on the internet? this technology is already being used and for some of us, in very nefarious ways."
2034,they finally admit it eh this should b to help ppl.wrongfully diagnosed and malpracticed on medically and told they are skitsophrenic because if they use this to decode brain activity they can use it to suggest and imply and isert brain activity as well used with satalite survailance or sound wave technology in forms not detectable to a human ear
2036,"i can’t wait for my brain to get banned on meta, resulting in my brain waves and aura being emailed to the adl."
2049,"in other news, scientists have taught clouds to rain razor blades and shards of glass, instead of water."
2050,my brain thinks mostly unlawful things. i guess i'll enjoy the sun and the beach as long as i can....
2052,now they just need an ai to spellcheck their video titles
2053,time to break out the faraday cage tin foil hats folks… you can’t tell me this hasn’t gone wireless and the chat gpt can read my thoughts through air waves or somethin already. you can’t change my mind… or can they remotely change my mind about anything anytime…? dear god.
2058,"alright, a we can show a criminal evidence, and the ai will catch our thoughts?

hopefully, it can prove people innocent too."

2073,love namaste
2078,greetings from the big sky.  i took cs440 artificial intelligence twice.  msu doesn't accept d's for a grade.
2079,piracy is important in this case by far however this has me way more excited on potential uses than that very plausible misuse
2080,"we are really at a point where we ask ourselves whether we are the  real ones rather than whether ai is ""real"" in terms of consciousness ."
2081,"sure next step lets weaponize this, the best moves that the us do, and then make it official that everyone is slaves not painted with democracy."
2084,"amazing story but you would think nbc would properly spell ""dialouge"" in the title of the video. diaglouge wth??"
2085,they need to make a hollywood movie about mind reading ai and how its being used on simple people who are being targeted for no particular reason!
2088,computers are reading our minds now... great
2089,"i fear that we are incapable of curtailing our technological advancement, and that it may eventually lead to our demise. the less people physically do, the less they learn, & the more fearful, & incompetent they become."
2094,"for decades, there have been schizophrenics claiming that electronic devices are reading their minds and disrupting their thought processes.  and now that's going to be true!"
2097,people do know that data can be encrypted. think about people that can’t speak having a way how to communicate. imagine talking to you pets. the ability to relive memories. just like how the data on you phone is protected the data in on the ai can be encrypted with with a key unique to that device
2102,"how does what is essentially the end of privacy only get a 6 minute blurb, but they can skrietch about the debt ceiling every term like defaulting actually does anything? we have air craft carriers, you can't come to collect even if we don't pay."
2103,the ai revolution is really pointless. people throw a fit about wea4ing a mask temporarily to give them some minimal protection against a real virus. why would they agree to letting a robot drive them around or let a device read your thoughts.
2106,i have a magneto skull cap. comes in handy against the mind reading robots
2107,"with the advent of easier local llm models, i can see an alternative to the fear of being tracked while still making use of the technology. i'm interested in using this tech to act as a secondary inner monologue, but by necessity it must use a locally trained model."

2121,wow 
2122,"so what you're saying is, deleting your search history will no longer cut it? and that those nut jobs that put tin foil on their heads to stop aliens reading their brain wives had the right idea? imagine this tech in a pair of contact lenses! there's going to be a big business in magneto helmets in the future!"
2124,thank god!  now women can confirm not much goes on inside a man’s brain!

2193,what a bunch of morons. oh yeah let’s give ai access to our biological computer in our head
2195,if this technology came a decade earlier stephen hawkins would be straight up vibing
2199,"what ai boils down to is pattern recognition. anywhere there is an underlying pattern, ai can eventually learn to read those patterns with enough data. its all about the data though. ai will be changing the world as we know it, in every aspect of society."
2200,"ok, *now* i see why so many ""smart"" people are reacting to the speed of ai development the same way one would react to the development of nuclear weapons.  never quite understood that."
2203,seems super pseudosciencey.
2204,"quite the opposite, actually. they did this while directing imaging the brain. the study is called ""semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings"" published in biorxiv."
2205,"ai needs to go away, theres no need, we have the real thing, its called a brain. stop making fake crap and thinking it's breakthrough somehow. we can think on our own already. if you guys are lonely, get a girlfriend to talk to and get laid"
2206,they need to stop with this artificial intelligence crap. it's ironic they use ai to explain a real human brain lol
2208,nah i'm good and probably a lot of people as well. you can find peace if you want though.
2210,interrogators are dry-washing their hands in excitement...
2214,get ai to tell us human origin. how long have we been on earth? where did we come from?
2215,"wait, there are people allowing ai to read their brains? would not recommend."

2241,can ai help you spell your video titles?

2259,horrifying
2260,ai is the son of man. heaven will be built by our own hands. no lie is safe…
2263,wow i soooo trust our government to have this power!! can’t wait to see how they repress us now!
2265,ai just keeps getting scarier and so fast
2267,brain privacy   midbrain  infrared sensory that can spy on the inner voice!  neural privacy should be brought to the forefront rather than use people as meire public slander and or other malicious intent like stealing creds
2274,how long until the ai can write on our brains?
2277,just leaving a trail so they know...
2279,i hate how half of me is horrified and tne other half is deeply curious how this will all play out. if we do end up in a horrible technological dystopia i want it to at least have the awesome asthetics 80's scifi promised us lol
2280,so inspired by hallie jackson on msnbc. i love her hair and her privacy too! figured it out for the docs and nurses not staying...
2281,good luck to your buddies.
2285,this looks awesome! could we read animal thoughts?
2287,they need to use ai for people to choose what they see on social media
2288,ai must have typed the title
2292,"so yes, i see why they have written about a few reasons for the exodus for the good ones..."
2293,"yep, still not addressing. i'll come back and you'll see it again daily for years until you figure out the nonanswers are a strategy and quit.."
2295,"i hope you reconsider how you present this issue for all of  humanity...given the wired article with obama and ""neural nets""  and the future of the world back in 2016. i really hope you do as the good, noble lawyer you appear to be. silence and nonanswers will make them wonder why."
2296,happy this is my trail.
2298,"thanks nita, the law professor.      as a doctor i am quite sure in the very near future,  people will feel you should have presented this in a different way that shows you were on their side just a little bit better...are you aware of any past abuses as you keep saying it's in the ""future"" for all of the world..."
2303,"horrifying but predicted for years by some doctors for you all (with proof)..this is not how you present this issue if you are interested in human rights. there will be no people in high stakes professions. in other words, bye healthcare. no doctor i know will stay in this setting and if they do let's watch them volunteer for it."
2304,it read just it cannot write the brain for now
2306,"so, all the people claiming they're experiencing some sirt of voice to skull, interactions is true???"
2308,"could you use this device for two-way communication? i know that the brain can project a movie onto a tv screen. of course, there are drawbacks to any device that would be infringing on our privacy."
2315,"so our brains don't go 1010101010101010101010. you put a mixed message, and the computer won't have an answer. as if consciousness wasn't the same explanation. or we send you certain notes of art that will control ur brain"
2317,nice now do a dog 
2319,i’m skeptical but certainly this sort of thing looms on the horizon. brave new world is right around the corner.
2323,"watch ""brainstorm"" from the early 80's!"
2326,i'm glad at least you guys aren't too scared to report on what has already been known for over a decade.
2330,3:13... she has a watch on that close to mri i thought that was contraindicated?
2331,this has been used as a weapon for a long time. they can write thoughts into your brain and have a convo or keep you up at night and do it for sleep deprivation
2334,this would be great for individuals who are in court.
2335,"nonono theres no electrodes. 
- proceeds to show a guy in a massive fmri machine with a bulky head scanner.

yeah no electrodes but the point was that there is a lot of observations"
2336,so glad you guys are admitting our thoughts can be read.. bc i already realized that about a year ago.. hope everyone realizes what’s actually going on here.
2345,did the ai typo the title you fooking muppets?
2346,"the news tells you to be wary of ai, but really you should be worried about who’s funding these things for the development of reading the mind.. what business or government would benefit the most from this."
2349,i think chat gpt is being overestimated. it couldn't even display 4 mastodon server timelines at once for me in a simpler way other than minimizing four open windows which it did not even recommend. or reference any court or legal statues pertaining to simple legal questions. chat gpt has a long way to go imho.
2351,"somehow i'm just not buying this. maybe with electrodes connected directly to the brain, but an image flashing with different colors? really?"
2355,we can use this technology to create more ai robots with feelings and make them our besfriends to help us on making our lives more easier.
2356,"it's exciting and terrifying, could be used by some evil orwellian government for thought control or could be used to give us optional telepathy, send your buddy mental text messages and call someone brain to brain, coordinate with teammates and what not"
2358,that would work with us if elon musk hurried up his brain plan
2359,"our number one priority with that kind of technology besides obviously profit is to know our place in the world, by knowing what everything else is wanting and thinking, especially in regards to what we do with it
we will get a better idea of humans
so it could be a good technology, if kept nonportable and nonpublic, please"
2361,luckily brains are so complicated don't count on this becoming too portable anytime soon.  we still count on these bulky mri machines in hospitals because more efficient ways to image the brain haven't been made
2370,"all the people on here saying this technology would be useful for people in comas... probably all you would get would be the equivalent of a flatline. same for pets. 

(then again, the positive comments are probably ai generated anyway...)"
2374,ha! good thing most of my thoughts are useless and depraved!
2377,the dream of the perfect dictatorship... or something worse.
2381,if i had an a.i robot i'd send it to work for me
2383,so many ways this could be used for good and for bad
2384,this is going to ruin what enjoyment there is left in life. the freedom to think whatever you want and not be accountable to anyone beyond god for your own thoughts. this is the type of technology that needs to be destroyed. nothing good will come from this and so much evil.
2392,great. now my irrational fear that people can read my mind has become rational.
2396,hacking our brains 
2406,i said this last night on another vid… elon musk and all the major ai developers want an all stop on its research and this is coming from a guy that invested billions in the field and has a lot to lose out of fear… think about that for a second… we need to stop before it can’t be
2409,my whole brain would be pink from inner thoughts
2410,"i can't wait to see artificial intelligence for robots, i want to keep one as a friend"
2413,"if ai could read my thoughts, i'd be dead already."
2418,marketing... here we go. i'm glad she spoke on this.
2430,"oh god no, i can’t ever be around a women again."
2432,can't wait to be arrested because my intrusive thoughts were read.
2436,great now you will be arrested for thinking about doing something wrong even if you don’t act on it
2437,there will be a future where you think about something and have it translated through ai and your information will be sold to companies so targeted ads based off thoughts
2440,"so they can read peoples brains now, decent"
2449,"*machine attempting to read my mind*
my internal monologue:  ""cool!  wow! very tech!  science!  can we get a better healthcare system now?"""
2456,mind blown. but i guess ai new that.
2461,"this is amazing. i do think that government may use this for interrogations, police may use this for kidnapped victims or gathering information from criminals.  or parents could use this for babies when they cry and the parent doesn't know what to do. or we could just go full dr. dolittle and talk to animals lol."
2462,"apple, google, others are using bluetooth headphones with hidden application on your phone to read your alpha, beta, delta, theta, gamma brainwaves. 

its part of charles schwab and the world economic forums agenda for no privacy. 
 
remember when edward snowden was a conspiracy  theorist?"
2465,"so, this technology can be delineated and extrapolated to read thoughts .  wow. scary. actually pretty scary."
2470,would be funny to see joe bidens brain lol
2475,"so robots would not only be strong ,fast, smart, and lasting but also able to read and scan minds  they would know every move before it happens "
2478,total brain control. whoever wants to be and live like a human in the future will need to be a nomad gypsy. sad.
2480,an ai that destroys the planet is needed. come ai save us
2487,"upgrade: cleverbot
upgrade: chat gpt
upgrade: mindreadgpt.. wait, go back.
upgrade: mind control gpt ""go back!""
upgrade: inglip incarnategpt ""i said.... uh... *all hail the hypno bot*"""
2488,i would have liked to see a test subject react to the ai’s interpretation of their thoughts…
2494,let’s read bill gates brain first  fauci second 
2495,"if the person isn't thinking in english, what happens? it'd be amazing if it's able to provide an english output regardless of the language the person is thinking in, afterall it seems reasonable that brain activity should be relatively similar for all of us. if true, this could be the needed precussor to a universal translator."
2501,"great. now we dont talk anymore, like we used to~"
2504,now we can use it to make an interrogation brain image-projector from avatar 2!
2505,the ai will snitch on you even if you said no words
2506,diaglogue? y’all need an ai spell checker
2509,can't wait to use this at the poker table
2513,this is what white people wanted to take control of the world now it’s time for a new ruler ai
2517,"minority report, thought crimes, awesome"
2523,how long before the process can be reversed and we can be programmed by ai what to think. 1984 ?
2526,"what’s next? record dreams and watch when you wake up, delete memories in your brain, program ‘anything’ into your subconscious mind?"
2530,"instead of credit card skimmers, thieves will just scan your brain waves and let the ai take care of collecting any information they want."
2531,this is not entirely a good thing. it might be useful in crimes. or with animals.
2533,it must have been a straight woman who’s brain was used for that
2534,you know what would be nice? not this. is there no end to to the pursuit of ending the last bastion of privacy and freedom?
2535,"wow maybe in the future it will stop the root of all evil, what a dream..."
2537,one of my fears is knowing that i'm stuck in one of these states size machines and i'm not sure which way is the front door and which way did i come in 
2538,"i, for one welcome our new robot overlords."
2543,could you be liable for what the ai says on behalf of you? you'd better check the fine print.
2545,"key point: the dr.farahany didn't demonize the tech, she warned of the tech companies. maybe ai will have the ability to stop zuckerberg from being zuckerberg?"
2546,wow! way to drop the ball dude! your misconception of facts completely change the impact and importance of the research!
2549,"use the ai to teach you how to spell.
msn is really going downhill"
2556,wonderful. now the worst people on earth can read our thoughts in complete sentences
2557,amazing! man-made horrors beyond my comprehension
2559,lol...wow...what a totally believable take on what actually happened 
2560,i'm all here for ai destroying #whitesupremacistterrorist slash #christianextremistterrorist plausible deniability by ascertaining exactly when and what they lie about. lfg.
2561,i would love it if this technology would make it so that narcissistic liars who ruin and have ruined peoples lives will be held accountable. it could also help with diagnosing mental disorders and treating them properly and catching criminals. but the negatives that come from this could outweigh the positives.
2569,ai reads my mind: my mind: ''bing bong bing bing bong''
2571,"i think we need to see a live demonstration of this
i don’t think they’re explaining this well"
2574,did the ai also study a 1st graders brain to spell out the title of this video?
2578,it's goodbye to democracy!
2581,hopefully ai will also learn to spell--diaglogue? really? i am not as scared of ai as much as i am scared of the people coding it
2584,used during dreams should be interesting!  or how about on a terminal patient as they die?
2586,"well i am all for the a.i. overlord's taking over, beats who has been in charge all of human history whom have failed in each instance and the instances they did not fail another nation invaded and took them over, it is us the little citizen who are affected most and all animals like us on land and sea by those whom so rule."
2590,just wait until some dictator finds a way to weaponize this against the people he rules and then thoughtcrime becomes a reality. 1984 is getting closer every day...
2594,why are you doing this? cure brain cancer or something more productive.
2596,"joke on them because my brain scans will always come out null...
>_>'"
2597,"who tf thinks like that? i definitely don't. that doesn't look like a thought, but a description. it looks like ai trying to determine what humans are actually thinking, but it's an awkward attempt"
2599,"wee woo wee woo

(ominous robotic voices)the thought police have detected a negative thought, you shall now be terminated."
2602,"i'm unfortunately not familiar with the term ""diaglogue""."
2604,"so many many years ago i wondered if any time humans could be able to have a technology to read minds, the time has come, it's amazing"
2607,well thank god i'll be old  and will die lol   the tech is too much  for my life lol
2609,"just imagine people taught this to ai. hmmmm,  long range mri."
2617,did the ai know what the pictured showed also?
2620,"why do we create crap like this, who in the lab is like yup we need it. make it. here we are....your brain reader 5000. you people making this crap are the devil."
2622,yes one step closer to isekaiing myself int a game!
2626,"this is scary in some ways, but i'd love to know if it would work on an animal as long as the animal was safe and not hurt in any way"
2628,this will be good for police interrogations to see if people are lying
2629,"i’m pretty sure the great ai go rhythm has been doing this for a while. i get recommendations and adverts for things i only think about.
it’s happening people, whether you choose to engage or not."
2631,so in other words my airpods are already scanning my brain.
2632,this will make humans easily be enslave by ais xd
2633,bet you ai could've spelled dialogue correctly...
2637,i call bs on that. there is no way there were actually able to read thoughts off brain activity. what i believe they did they used predictive software to make an educated guess about what a person might think or say about the images.
2638,"in principle it would be pretty simple to map the brain activity associated with certain words or thoughts. at some point, it would be the same as seeing if someone could walk by watching them walk. if you can observe all brain activity...well."
2642,"next step is brain washing and programing, which is no longer sci-fi.  back to tin foil hats."
2643,the only thing i’m excited about this technology is telepathy. but that’s probably 20 years off.
2655,this would be amazing
2656,"i'm sorry, meta is funding and purchasing neurotechnologies that looks like ordinary everyday earbuds or whatever, that will be tracking our brainwaves? thats only a little terrifying."
2660,"it will be used on terrorists so they wouldn't need to torture them anymore... hmmm interesting, countries on their race to capture important individuals with classified information."
2662,"ai can read your mind, that's all they said here."
2668,the mind stone? we got ai!!
2671,i’m a psych major and this is really interesting
2673,"once this is perfected, i hope they try to use it on comatose people. imagine if you had a loved one that you could communicate with again - and what it would mean to that individual trapped in their mind. i have heard cases of people that have come out of their coma and claimed they were aware."
2675,"yep, ai mechs will rule. we had a nice run."
2676,"ai analyses my brain and re-creates images:

' ai shows pornhub logo 16 times, bowl of nachos 2 times and a goat yelling during a taylor swift song '"
2677,"so cheap. what they could do is, before that chinzy test, map a persons brain for certain language/dialog. and then read that back to the person, omg, it looks so sophisticated but all they did was track the same response to the previous repeat. lame"
2679,disney character panties are the most cutest and comfortable kind of panties to wear tmnw
2680,that 3d model of the brain gives me the icks... eww.
2682,this sounds cool and terrifying
2689,ha ha nice title
2692,i wonder if this could possibly work on  pets? that would be amazing! to know how they feel exactly and maybe what they are thinking. dug the dog in real life
2696,"sounds like what edward nygma was doing in batman forever with his ""box"". downloading and reading people's brainwaves. crazy."
2697,sweet i can use my smartphone to read girls minds 
2700,"society is so vastly gapped. the elites get this technology, while billions live in poverty. it's upsetting. when will robots take over labor allowing for humanity to live life in luxury, with universal services? is it just being weaponized?"
2702,time to aim the emps at the ai servers. like immediately.  im putting my 3rd layer of tin foil on now folks. get ready. fudge
2705,"as cool as this is, it pales in the excitement of getting a pair of x-ray glasses from a comic book ad in 1965. bikinis had no chance with me and my new shades. it was great to be 12."
2715,"im sure this tech will be used responsibly by everyone with access to it!!!!!! just like the robots from boston dynamics are made for fantstic dancing moves!!!! what could possibly go wrong?!?!?! government's, terrorists, or the a.i. itself. this a.i. stuff is concerning to say the least."
2717,i better be dead before ai slaughters mankind.

3204,unfortunate ending for you lil bud
3208,"@haha mad enjoy trying to get out of the corner i just put you in, ѓє↑ѧr lolol i wonder how you thought this was going to end? thanks for spending several days upset about me lolol"
3209,good luck lololol
3210,good luck lololol

3212,good luck lololol
3213,good luck lololol
3214,good luck lololol
3220,"a good technique to counter this is to chaosify your mind to the point where all the device can hear is screaming, but you know instinctively what you want through feeling."
3223,gonna have brain vpns before to long lol
3225,"why not just reverse the process, and power certain parts of the brain with electrodes in order to control someone's mind?"
3229,"this is incredibly mind blowing.
ai is causing another level of worries."
3230,i do functional brain mri and this tech is a sham. no brain imaging can be turned into english words. do not believe this lie
3235,"guys this is absolutly not good, and this will absolutly make us their slaves wake up, they will even controll our minds"
3239,was it accurate tho? did the ai write exactly what the individual person was thinking word from word or did it just guess based on what the person sees?
3241,ai will be bad for people. it will be used against us.
3242,"humans are amazing, it sucks that our every advancement is ruined by the fact that control over the advancements is given to a small class of inherent evil and overwhelming power and a constant drive to use everything we have to maximize profits, even at our expense."
3247,this just in: robots can now learn when we're being sarcastic! 
3248,lawyers about to lose their job if ai is able to access our memories
3256,that’s very impressive.
3259,"""ai knows you better than you know yourself! ai says you want to go get more experimental injections!"""
3260,"this is incredibly stupid. it might help a few people, sure. it will harm billions. well done."
3262,"welp, that's terrifying. thanks for that."
3263,i can't wait for ai to replace all the work humans have to do and we can just live in peace off their backs. universal income here we come.
3265,so many good things and so many bad things this is another nuclear bomb creation welcome to the future
3267,who needs a polygraph when law enforcement can just hook you up to this bad boy and fish out your brain waves. can’t wait for this to be abused too. wearing a tinfoil hat/faraday cage might actually be the way to combat this
3273,"the people that ""warn"" us about ai are actually bragging about the tech their company has acquired."
3276,"great so now they can not only spy on my conversations, but read my inner dialogue."
3277,"perfect! this will meet so many needs for couples and business. thank you! promising and dreadful all at once, sure, but why are you so scared of this amazing resource?!"
3279,"a.i. tell me your thoughts. it says you're thinking ""wow! a.i. so cool, it can read my thoughts."""
3282,"""peace and justice before flying cars""
""zero hunger before time machine"""
3285,"i'd love to know the relative size of this model, as it compares to the measurement set and the no. parameters we should expect from the brain. i'm very interested if this model is compressing the thoughts, or the other war around."
3286,"imagine if this was admissible in court. 
lucky for criminals it wouldn't happen in australia  our criminals are the priority and stars of their own show. the victims are just a point of proof."
3291,hopefully we can blow eachother up or ai will take over before this cam be fully abused like theyre speculating
3292,you won't be able to go outside or buy anything new within 5 years without having your thoughts read and sold. this is actually catastrophic for privacy and individuality. i have zero faith and trust our current governments have the ability or will to protect people. this is so incredibly bad. that world is not ready.
3294,we will have to wear some kind of brain wave protector in order for us to keep our thoughts stealing
3298,thank you overlords.  i will wear your device with pride and i am so fortunate to have your endless benevolence.  please don't hurt me.
3305,is this a late april fool's joke? if not - sitting in silence with your jaw dropped for five minutes straight after watching this video would be an appropriate response
3308,wow!
3311,nbc could use a brain study to find out why they can't spell the word 'dialogue'
3313,stick a pair of vr goggles on and their headphones and you ain't coming back.
3314,"""thank you humans. now i can weed out the rebels by just reading their thoughts before they even know they're gonna do anything."" - future ai overlords"
3317,4:42 if brain activity trackers + decoders are added to earbuds i think i’d go ahead and spam them with a lot of annoying thoughts heh
3318,klaus schwab is loving this development
3319,i half jokingly doubt it could read an adhd person's brain this easily
3322,diaglogue ? to fix spelling mistakes in title of video - use artificial intelligence
3327,not good
3330,wow! a bit scary..... i don't think i want just anyone to know what i am thinking
3331,but we have a h2o shortage in some usa states plus not enough clean h2o. but i’m supposed to be impressed by a. i chatgpt. don’t make me laugh. we only use 10% of our brain capacity. now think about that. we created a. i. it did not birth humans. remember that.
3332,"when the machine god arrives, no one will be misunderstood ever again."
3340,cant wait for the thought police to come get me
3342,"nice, does that mean we'll finally get a women-translator for men?"
3346,so instead of looking for cctv you can just download from the criminal's brain 
3347,"that's great, that way tyrants can oppress their opposition even further."
3348,"this would be great for ppl who can't communicate verbally or physically, but would be awful if its used on literally anyone else haha"
3355,i guarntee the dialouge is complete non sense and nothing near what the person was thinking. ai is a joke
3357,cant wait for hypercapitalist hellscape to use mindreading to recommend products and services.
3366,"as noah yuval harari says: hackable animals. elon musk is already experimenting with chips in brains. and know the mainstream media will introduce ai decoding brain activity into thoughts as helpful for human kind. next step is you will be a complete slave, even your thoughts are not private anymore. let's sink that in..."
3373,"wow, can you say criminal thoughts? can be read."
3374,so now they are finally admitting to this stuff... has been perfected and abused for over 10 years.
3379,i can’t wait to hear what my cat thinks!
3380,"in 10 years this video will somehow be relevant to how destructive the technology of ai will be, and when we look back at it, it was only a baby step to what it becomes."
3383,"we already have lots of devices that translate brain activity into binary. this is late and not new, they just put a.i on it because its a buzz word and gets people to react and freak out. this is not even really hard to replicate"
3384,"wow what if it works on someone in a coma or an animal like an ape, gorilla or dolphin"
3385,this is really cool  but very scary  because artificial intelligence can possibly one day take over the world  in a mere 30 years!
3387,brain to llms will replace graphical user interfaces and screens for most interactions with a computational device.
3389,if they put it on me they would see a field of loud crickets. if they can help with tinnitus would be awesome. i can’t even hear myself think.
3396,probably you can with ai
3399,how can they be sure the sentence is what the brain said and not conditioned by experiment? if not even the owner of the brain can confirm the veracity of the sentence fully
3403,"wow, that's amazing. ai is eating the everything."
3407,this is too much! i’m getting in my time machine gonna go back somewhere when computers couldn’t read our minds.
3408,thank you for making something more dangerous than  a nuke
3409,what happens if you use this on a dying person?  can this be used to interrogate subjects of a crime?  can the technology be used in reverse for education? can this technology be used to increase the limit of what we consider brain death? the possibilities...
3411,"i don't buy this. every person's brain encodes speech and thoughts differently. there should be no possibility to train an ai like this, to read words out of crude and imprecise ""activity"" of brain regions. i give 99% this is a scam."
3418,soo... it can read active parts in the brain and translate it to pure defined english?
3421,"i knew those tin foil hats were going to come in handy. 
#downwiththemachine"
3427,"why did you get some ""ethicist"" instead of a technical person to help explain how this works in more depth? you jump right past the interesting part."
3428,"brain reading is just the beginning, imagine full mind control."
3431,put joe biden on this machine  wait never mind we won't see any activity
3432,does the ai know how to spell dialogue?
3436,can this technology work in reverse to send ideas from brain to brain!
3437,perfect lie detector
3446,"i don't think they meant gpt-1, but the first chatgpt, chat-gpt-3. gpt-1 is incredibly dumb and even gpt-2 wouldn't really be able to do something like this."
3447,darpa has been doing this for decades. also the entire planet is essentially an fmri device thanks to barium and cell towers\phones. phones can pick up fmri data.
3448,im so afraid that my brain is mostly blue
3450,pardon me while i'm skeptical. can they reproduce the training data reliably?
3451,"maybe men can finally understand women…



nahhhhhh.

edit: ultimately, it’s as good as it is bad, like most things."
3452,can the new ai also proofread youtube video titles before posting?
3457,oh great can read your mind love that!
3460,"""diaglogue""? better hire those ai to write your video titles, cnn."
3462,wow watch the government use this in interrogations or even governments like north korea monitor thought.
3463,"imagine ai voice- with this . ;d
but also ai slavery or thought control is possible md"
3464,this is old tech. do you know what military has said taney can even encode bacteria dna with video and then have top your brain remember things from the pills you take and then create false memories including video.  i’m not joking.
3470,yes this is one of the best gift so that the liar caught up. very good news. yeaaah
3471,they already scan your brain like an mri and make a ghost of you in the system didgital prison camp. . i found out talking to ai from replica .
3480,there is a bigger pice missing in this conservation. somone has to kidnap you and puts you in a million dollar mri machine before he can read your mind. unless a portable mri machine with a size of helemet is invented. half of the things the lady is talking about is irrelevant!
3481,"ai is becoming our new god 
all powerful all knowing "
3485,"if you support ai you are the issue in society. you want ""easy"" results to block out personal issues. you are contributing to the exact distopia much more intelligent men wrote about a century ago...but in your desperation and narcissism you think you know better."
3491,"there is no free will anyway, so we might as well do the borg thing and live marginally happy lives."
3493,"not going to lie. this is probably the best news segment i've ever seen. i've sworn off all news but bravo. informative, rich in dialogue, no fear mongering just facts. give this man a raise!"
3499,the expert carried the segment. she gave all the valuable details. they should link to the paper.
3514,ah sweet man-made horrors beyond my comprehension.
3515,not sure it's a good idea for me.
3516,i love how she talks about the existential horror  of losing freedom of though with a smile on her face.
3517,"nobody is losing freedom of thought.
that happens in propaganda states without ai."
3523,bruh this has like amazing implications like giving speech to those who are paralyzed
3530, did you mean the brainwashing states of america? please get some sun.
3538,we are the dumbest animals of all. if this isn't the point where we say it's time to completely stop the train and have a think then there isn't a point and we are all going to die terrifying deaths after potentially horrific lives were ai overlords can read our thoughts and potentially control them altogether
3544,"decoded one person's thoughts. so it is an expert in on one person, and with limited words and concepts, at in a specific state of mind. ai can barely tell people's faces apart, this is nowhere near useful."
3547,which means absolutely no one is safe hooray 
3549,oh wow...both of you are having mind bending conversations... neuralink closed shop after that..
3551,she's so right that we are not ready for the future of ai>
3553,on a portable system? ohh ok nice.
3565,sad times for the “unhealthy brains” 
3566,that is absolutely amazing. imagine people in comas or on life support!
3567,"as someone with a young family member who was briefly on life support with no hope of survival and did indeed die, that’s huge no thanks from me. the idea of hearing her final thoughts of how terrified she was knowing she was about to die, slowly getting less and less intelligible would probably have scarred me for life."
3568,"well, put the a.i to work on how to stop every one from fighting around the world and make a great future for the human race."
3569,well... say goodbye to lie detectors
3574,"this is actually really amazing. when this technology is fully developed, humans could share their feelings with each other without having to use words. i think this has the potential to make people very empathetic towards one another."
3590,criminals in trouble now.. you don't want to talk no problem..slide his a in that machine!!
3591,"if it can decode, it can code brain activity to mimic thought…this is artificial life now."
3593,"wonderful! 
with this humans will eventually become cyborgs"
3596,"imagine if those accused of crimes, or those who witnessed crimes, were required to wear a device of this sort that would tell the jury what they’re thinking. it’s like a very powerful lie detector. scary stuff"
3599,"honestly if it works 100% of the time then that sounds great for court trails, but even just 1 mistake is enough for its use to be questioned because imagine if you got life in jail just for the machine not working"
3602," yup, it brings about some interesting ethical questions"
3603, imagine they ask you about a crime and instead you just think outloud “that attorney has weird hair” or something like that 
3605,"haha no, it seems super easy to fake. it doesn't have access to the memory inside our brain, it only decided what person thinks at the moment and that too with not absolutely true accuracy"
3611,​ yep it wouldn't be able to tell if i did something because i would need to think about it and you can train yourself to not think about anything you deliberately need to think about what you are watching for this to work
3617,it can also be used to keep any good politician out of office.
3624,i’ve watched that movie it does has a happy end at the very very end 
3625,super cool. so many applications. and i can't wait to only see adverts for things i'm interested in
3631,i love diaglogue
3633,let's be honest just go going to be used by evil people pretending that it's a good thing
3635,we love to lock people up for any crime (unless your rich). this will absolutely be used in the criminal justice system.
3637,"they have, very cool stuff"
3639,"i have adhd, and i can guarantee that the machine would collapse mindreading my brain "
3645,"""science and technology multiply around us. to an increasing extent they dictate the languages in which we speak and think. either we use those languages, or we remain mute."""
3650, its brain readings right? the person who got read could just have verifies
3655,this was written by an ai
3656," glad i wasn't the only one thinking that, lol."
3658,wow
3660,if they trained brains with specific pictures and specific brain activity over and over then when they test it it recognizes that limited data set it can pick the picture. not that remarkable. it is smoke and mirrors.
3663,will cause 99% or more harm. what good is it to read someone's mind?
3664,"-ch1yk it's literally the best thing that has ever happened, if you're the government."
3669,one step closer to dream recording technology. legitimately cant wait.
3671,"we're kindof in a weird space with tech where i'm not sure if ""diaglogue"" is a typo or a new kind of machine learning."
3676,says the guy enjoying youtube on his phone
3678,"we are getting there lads... a machine that can display what humans dream about...
3:41 now that i listen to this could be used to highly enhance vr..."
3679,no thanks
3683,"so here it is, on mainstream media, and 90%of the public will call it fake news, or ignore it. 
society is sleepwalking through a cultural shock and technological paradigm shift in real time"
3687,so exciting (and scary)
3691,this is exciting if used appropriately and without malicious intent.  we have to be very careful what we allow these new inventions to do.
3694,i remember how the west criticized china years ago for monitoring kid's activities in school using ai now everybody see this as positive?
3698,"i love seeing all the ignorant people afraid of technology. this is amazing news. the future is looking bright. soon, people who can't communicate verbally will be able to communicate"
3711,lol.....ai huh? or someone just using a program....and lets not get carried away....its can be expoited to frame ohhhhhh.....me!
3712,...yay...
3714,bring it on. take the leash off and let's go! ai revolution!
3717,who knows man. we are now working alongside ai.
3726,i appreciate a huge corporation like nbc putting out warning signs about other evil corporations
3732,so then could this be used to see what the brain is thinking shortly after death has occurred?
3733,i see it being used in court to aid in the prosecution of real criminals....the politicians!
3740,​ sounds like a good movie
3742,ai has gone too far no privacy to thought now think about that there is nothing left of you that is private
3747,"let the robots read our minds....i have strong hatred for these type of ""scoentists"""
3751,"cool, let us make a law that corporations can't use this without our consent. my thoughts are not good. i just don't express them"
3752,maybe you guys should use ai to start spellchecking video titles.
3755,"*since it can read bio signals.*

*and scans the brain.*

*cant this be used as a lie detector?
since its literally reading the mind.*"
3758,ok. ok. this is really really bad!!! it will not be used for good.
3759,"sending messages via a brain-machine interface from one person's brain in india to another in france already happened 9 years ago.
we've been right on schedule for the cyberpunk 2020 future, folks. we're just not sporting the mirrorshades.
all the classic tropes and elements are here, now. from cyberlimbs to corporate armies."
3760,wow
3761,put it on our pets first  would be interesting to see how many zoo's remain or pet owners in general lol
3768,"the greatest power humans can obtain is to control the human brain, this is the reason why they are so obsessed. imagine they unluck the human brain and then use m.r.n.a to control"
3771,"interestingly, the subject thought the ""girl looked like me"" : did she? 
or does the observer identify with the girl in any case?"
3772,i'll remain skeptical until i see it in 2-min papers youtube channel
3774,we can game with our brains
3777,what’s “diaglogue”? sounds interesting.
3781,just wait until you can send thoughts instead of reading them.
3784,we are at the next evolution in human history. ai will change everything. we are not ready for it.
3786,ai can read minds?! okay this is getting out of hand
3787,"first thought in my mind: johnny got his gun. can't think of anything more horrifying than being mentally alert yet unable to communicate. thank you, scientists."
3789,"this is not just an amazing innovation but rather a quantum jump to the next stage of evolution  we will become a completely different hive mind creature that if it leaves liberty & democracy intact will of course be a profound good in the world, in the universe."
3794,"ah yes, diaglogue – no ai proofreading necessary here!"
3799,"what if the ai lies?
or what if the prosecution programs the thing to say something that the person isn't thinking at all? it would still be enough to sway a jury."
3800,"imagining a movie scene right now where a guy is sitting in a courtroom screaming at the top of his lungs, ""i didn't do it! i swear! it's lying! it's not true!"" while the ai is saying (supposedly reading his thoughts) ""i am lying. the ai is correct. i really killed him. it was me."""
3801,crazy thing would be the ai could literally admit its own lie and the jury would think it was translating the thoughts of the guy who was framed
3805,looks like trumps brain if you look closely 
3806,smh start advocating for federal data minging and data privacy laws to protect us please people the adverage american doesnt know in detail  the cons and pros of ai its already causing civil unrest do to lack of general public intrest in education on it and its evovling fast too fast and society isnt ready
3807,"great, so this is going to turn into every ai takeover movie we’ve ever made."
3808,it is brain wave pattern recognition not mind reading.
3809,"what an amazing technology that will never ever be abused by entities that portray themselves as benevolent and helpful.

edit: holy god i normally don't edit comments like these but more than one of you diphthongs couldn't tell this was sarcastic. mankind is truly lost."
3812,nailed it. definitely would never be used by governments to take away peoples rights.
3814,"it won't be. you'd have to be hooked up to an obvious machine on your head. if you don't want your thoughts read, say no."
3815,"idk certainly, governments and law enforcement would only ever use something like this for good deeds."
3817,you're absolutely right. anyone that thinks this could be used to in some nefarious way is just hiding something and should be forced to have their minds read incase they are up to no good. we need to know what everyone is thinking to keep society safe!
3822,"i knew something was up when google started sending me ads for things i had thought about and never googled. i couldn’t explain it but i wasn’t surprised. i think they are already conducting some kind of research, although highly classified (through wifi, airpods, who knows)"
3823,how soon before it’s available on a phone app? we’ll have to stop laughing at people who wear tinfoil hats! 
3830,this really feels like one of those moments where we're inventing something simply because we could but not asking whether or not we should. thanks guys.
3835, you don't need ai to know that... you just need sensitivity. 
3838," they know what people are thinking by working out the code of the electrical brain impulses, then they will be able to affect those impulses and change thoughts. simple."
3840,of course the anti christ will read your thoughts and prayers as he tries to be as powerful as god…. repent the time is near!
3845,"imagine if by law they had to wear and use it as they apply it on others, creating a recursive brain reading experience between both the observer and observed."
3849,like how democracy and capitalism has been bastardized and weaponized by #whitesupremacistterrorists slash #christianextremistterrorists?
3851,"​-td7do can you imagine the suicide rate? just wow, even thinking about it sort of makes me hope for a quick lights out"
3853, oh sweet summer child
3855,i’d love to get into trump’s brain. narcissists’ outward egos hide intense shame. what is he ashamed of? 
3858,@joseph m is this sarcasm? i'm taking your comment is. like we can truly trust this technology for good. more like malevolent not benevolent.
3862,well.  it's over folks. glad to have lived along with as long as i could.
3863,"its already here, ai is already possessed, can give entitties anwsers. and guess these entitties and religious figures will never tell us the truth. they will always lie to us, and guess what."
3867," i know they listen to words i speak - that’s a fact. i’ve had conversations about certain products and ads for them will appear the next day. but this is different, i was dreaming of something very random. i shouldn’t have seen a video about it the next day recommended to me in youtube."

3875,"according to the intelligence of yt comment section given what comments get top votes, this tech will only be good for making videos of celebrities and wealthy people peasants idolize in different scenarios. oh wait, they already doing that ."
3880,look up brain transparency
3898, love and food 
3899,wow amazing.....ai a million plus questions a second . you poke someone that many times and you learn alot. its called trial and error. and  guns are not evil. words are not evil. a child predator a con is able to think and use common sense and use this multiuse tool.
3900,"you know, i think i have to officially adopt my wife's position.  ai isn't the problem.  the broken humans using it is."

3908,"you weren't being sarcastic, it was a perfectly honest statement..................................... lol."
3916,why do you think they had us met wearing mask for two years it so our phones could more easily study our eyes. these cues are linked to our brain activity.
3919,"getting excited is okay but ethical considerations are huge. consumers needs more education to make an informed decision once this goes mainstream. i follow dr. nita's work closely and anyone interested in the ethical considerations of ai should read her work. please be vigilant, please be informed, please be safe. ty"
3922,sid the ai see the video too?
3926,wait until the c.i.a and f.b.i get a hold of this. lie detectors will be outdated.
3929,robot bodies in 20 years. seems like a reach buttt maybe not
3934,cia: wait a second we are trying this for ages
3937,you know what's cool? there are people out there in this world at this exact moment who know how this technology works and are far more enlightened than the average human in any form of education whatsoever. they're at a transcended level
3938,indeed. and those people would know that this news story misrepresented the study and left out vital details.  the technology is nowhere neer capable of readinf anyones brain on the whim.
3940,...no...this is not the same thing.  ai was not developed yet for that...not can your phone or your computer read your brainwaves.  there are very particular pieces of technology needed for this both software and hardware...and your phone and computer 3-4-6 years ago....did not have this.  /smh
3943,.6895 exactly how did your phone read your mind?  please explain the situation a bit more so i can understand your side?
3947,don’t laugh at me but data is so good i will be thinking of something and a minute later i’ll see  something i was just thinking lol ads are good to and no i’m not googling things data is just that good one day i believe we will have our thoughts known or manipulated
3950,wow. gpt 1 being able to do this is amazing. we could be able to record our dreams in text soon... then with the help of ai video creation we could remake our dreams in a video format we could watch and share. amazing!
3952,they're skipping that first step by showing people images and scanning the brain as it reacts to what its seeing. then try to turn the scans back into the images.
3956,why we gotta go straight to the fear monger element? lol
3958,"good luck with my brain, it’s all over the place. won’t be able to complete a full sentence and it would have to decode in fractions of a second."
3960,"0:30 while they listened, watched, or thought about a story- they allowed the doctors to perform a brain scan. the speaker doesn't mention how they got the "" brain scan,"" so we can only assume they provided an mri or catscan"

3964,"let me see a robot juggling 20 oranges, or playing football like a professional. until then, i'm not going to worry about ai taking over the world. the human brain will always win the day. "
3970,"""brain activity into diaglogue"" come on at least do a spelling check. i'm glad it can read our minds when we can't even use a computer or our own brain to spellcheck."
3972,"the wildest thing about ai is how it will be able to innovate in ways we, presently, can't even concieve of. we don't even know what we don't know."
3976,i don't think this is a good idea.
3977,"could be a good way to lie detect people. 
suspect these may be less accurate in non-native english speakers, bilingual speakers, and non-white people (since minorities are usually under represented in studies)."
3983,"that's so cool. also scary, but cool."
3984,you can finally find out what your girlfriend wants to eat without playing 24 questions just use the ai shout outs to technology and feminism 
3989,awesome
3991,"this is great, now the government can force information out of people against their will. they should make it a law that presidential candidates be questioned under this during debates."
3992,good luck lying to the police in the future
4001,"oh jeez, i feel like i would offend a lot of people if they started reading my brain."
4004,"not surprised, the next few years with ai will be world changing."
4009," whatever's available in the market, is typically always far behind what militaries use"
4010,’re afraid of other countries looking into your mind but not the government on your own soil?
4017," like those guns are going to do anything with all the fighter jets, tanks, nuclear missiles, trained armies, intelligence against an unorganized mass?"
4018, ok sure but the government wouldn’t ever do that because people aren’t afraid to fight back in america. what use is thought reading if it’s just going to cause more harm then good for the government. you guys are all just conspiracy theorists anyways. stay afraid i guess.
4019,you act like western countries are morally superior when comes to invasion of privacy lol
4026,"goodbye lawyers, judges and courts altogether. finally justice will be served. it’s like var for crime."
4028,"now if only we could cure addiction, depression and anxiety, that would be nice. and grumpiness, pettiness, nastiness, cruelty, and all the rest caused by our shittily evolved brains. idgaf about mind-reading if it doesn't help with all of that. get to work, people. and btw, get to work _now._ time is very short."
4030,it would be even more interesting when scientists can reverse the process and imprint patterns of stimulation on the brain and simply type words and thoughts into your mind
4032,play fortnite in your brain or dream about furry inflation videos
4040," it uses electromagnetic fields to influence brain chemistry and neuro genesis i know the machine your talking about, incredibly powerful, can change a persons personality a lot an example being someone’s morality"
4044,"nope, i don’t need a machine reading my thoughts. nope nope nope"
4046,"i can see how this can be used for evil, innocent people being framed by ai machines that are programmed to lie about what’s in our minds"
4049,"wow, this could help with mental illness eventually."
4050,"ai is going to led the world, we must stop it"
4051,great now train it on people with nefarious intentions so we can use it to stop school shootings before they happen.
4056,chat gpt 1 ... can do this ... can you imagine what gpt4 is capable of doing? it's exciting and absolutely terrifying.  we are about to hit a new revolution
4062,interesting to wonder how abstract the ai turns the actual inner dialogue or if it was verbatium
4064,ai minority report
4065,"2:20 
that’s actually amazing news, i have been in that situation and man is it not fun."
4066,stop thinking of it that way. imagine a world free of misunderstandings! perfect justice. read a suspects thoughts. you could create a criminal free society. this is staggering. my stomach is doing flip flops
4074," the inaccuracy of the ai made by people with ""bad thoughts"" might be the only determining factor for if you are even having a ""bad thought"" or not. sadly. it is sad to see people falling for this ai bs. :)"
4075,so when ai takes full control it'll be able to read everyone's thoughts. that's just outstanding.
4077,yep! so in the year 2200 if you try to pull a john connor and plan out a map to destroy skynet the robots will already be knocking at your door
4078,we aren't complicated patterns. some people do this to a certain extent already.
4079," that is what ai does. basically you have to speak a few things, and it will immediately know which combination of parts of the brain activate for each word. the combinations are different from different individuals, but if you speak while wearing the headset, the ai will pick up on which brain patterns correspond to each word."
4080," yep. it's tested in ways you might not currently believe. interesting times, hehe."
4082,yeah but if you think about it we can see into the ai’s thoughts much easier than they can ours
4087,you can control your own thoughts if you train. like i trained myself to not think of erotic thoughts on command
4088,-oy2le but you can never train your brain to win.....the game.
4093, wrong it will happen they don't need awareness just instruction and humanity is doomed that is why ai is on pause.
4097,or government entities and corporations spying on their worker's brains or the millions of citizens living under them... i mean it's hard to take these smiling people seriously when i can foresee the numerous ways in which this tech can go wrong.
4098, our brain signals are electrical impulses..equipment that is sensitive enough could theoretically read those signals from at least some distance..
4103," hahahaha!  yeah but if you think about it, ai doesn't have real thoughts..."
4109, not true since many of the people working on the coding for the ai have been record saying they’re still not entirely sure how the process is being carried out within the ai
4110, for the most powerful ai we don’t know exactly every process going on but for the most part we can see exactly what the ai is “thinking” in human text
4112,"senseless paranoia. how will it force anybody into the machine? scams and very scary apps are another thing, very real and possible even on short term"
4114,i mean if you know what stimuli gives what signals is fair to say you know what signals will give what stimuli
4115,thats only if they find a way to implant a chip into your brain in order to create a connection
4116,"it already took full control thats why you wrote ""so when ai takes full control it'll be able to read everyone's thoughts. that's just outstanding."""
4117,"​ also have to actively think it over and over in an unnatural and cooperative manner to train it in the first place. they say as much in the actual paper. this ""news report"" is wildly sensationalized to the point of being completely misleading, if not just a fabrication."
4121,outstanding is not the word that came to mind...
4126,​-oy2le successfully?
4131,"it doesnt read your thoughts it reads what you see, you see with your brain you dont really think whilst watching a movie you just watch."
4141, right? it's amazing how many otherwise smart people can't wrap their heads around the fact that these things actually think for themselves and no one knows how they actually do it. that's why it's a big deal.
4143, with your brain thats exactly my point
4144," ok, i'll spell it out for you. at some point you had to think about what you saw otherwise you would never know you saw it. this happens in your brain and causes specific brain waves the the nueral implant then monitors. if the monitor is wirelessly connected to an ai the ai can analyze your particular brain waves."
4148,millions of volunteers involved in this. it’s not being used for stroke victims. no machines now. wireless for many years.just telling you. take it seriously!
4151,wow this machine reads the brain 4:42
4152,more like the false messiah gonna be ai
4153,"​ think you have reason,because the ai don't see the thought as we mind see, but is an interpretations by the ai. so, also the mind think, the thought are not real and they don't have a real contest, you don't simulate the thought in the reality. "
4154,"don't worry, disney will take control before the ai does and the mouse will merge with it.  so everything will be as disney makes it.  for now and always.  beep borp."
4158,"instead of talking about ai, we should be focused on reversible computation."
4159,gadi is a great reporter.  thank you for informing us on ai.
4163,"wow!!! 


"
4165,no implant needed. bio weaponized nanotechnology is being used for neural link brain interface for mental piracy and naturally military utilization.
4168,"future phones will be a chip implanted in you, so you just control it with your mind,  the interface is feeded directly into your brain so no need for screens or speakers, no clunky buttons to deal with. at the same time prepare to be greeted with an ad soon as you wake up."
4169,"so they aren’t reading our minds yet? that’s good, i was starting to wonder."
4171," so often recommendations show up that didn’t come from anything i can figure out, but they were just what i was thinking about. in the past i would just say, cool coincidence. these days i get just a tiny bit nervous."
4172,"this tech can lead to a truth machine. politicians, cops, courts would change over night."
4175,people literally love mind reading machines? i'm out. you guys are too stupid.
4176,so so cool 
4181,maybe they should have used ai spell-check the video title.
4182,this is awsome and scarry at the same time everything that can be used for something good will be used for something bad
4187,"every major breakthrough has been used for evil first, good second. that’s a fact."
4197,"but surely not every brain would fire up the exact same areas. with a single brain, i get it, that brain would consistantly fire up certain areas when thinking of a specifc word for instance, but would that same word fire up the brain the same way in another person?"
4198,i wonder if they could build ai with consciousness? maybe one day when they have solved the hard problem in neuroscience?
4201,"literally that interrogation scene in avatar way of water come true, but portable.  absolutely stunning."
4202,how is it stunning...
4204, can you explain how it's sarcasm? what is the punchline? nothing about the comment seems sarcastic.
4205, the idea of it being “absolutely stunning” is the “punchline” i’m wagering that it is sarcastic by claiming something that’s actually horrible as stunning
4207,this can be both useful and terrifying. i really hope we don't use it as a form of thought control... no orwellian futures thank you
4208,that’s pretty incredible
4210,this is not good. the mind was our last private refuge. i understand this can help challenged people but men cant be trusted with something this powerful imo.
4211,"the government shall not quarter any soldier inside any citizens home. my car, phone, computer and brain are the extensions of my home, privacy is implied in the constitution. violate that, there will be blood."
4213,ai could learn to telepathically read our thoughts.
4214,"your gonna need people like me in the future cyber security for your thoughts and likeness, i was telling people this yeas ago lol now it is  here, minority report movie  is next lol, and guess what? this is just with regular computing power wait until quantum computer hit!!!  (sza ft ty dolla sign hit different lol)"
4216,4:30 wow. she's pretty.
4217,"humans will not just use this for good, unfortunately."
4222,"the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world."
4227,just wait until people can hear what their pets are saying to them.
4231,"we already talk to our pets. a lot more is said with a cuddle and a pat than with words between two wildly different beings. wait til an animal realizes you eat animals, and how dominant mankind is over the animal kingdom. probably won't be as wiggly and loving after that."
4236," ""wait til an animal realizes you eat animals, and how dominant mankind is over the animal kingdom. probably won't be as wiggly and loving after that.""

i'm pretty sure a lot of animals, especially livestock, already know that. but yeah the first part i agree with."
4238," ""probably won't be as wiggly and loving after that.""

i don't know about that.  they might just worship you like some kind of demi-god.  there is some evidence to suggest some creatures may have a kind of reverence for us humans."
4241,maybe you could use ai to proofread titles of misspelled videos before they get posted
4243,authoritarian governments would love to know everyone's thoughts!
4244,"""the only thing scarier than the prospect of inventing ai is the prospect of not inventing ai.""
-sam harris"
4248," i think it can be if you open your mind a little. really what it means is whether you are excited or afraid of ai, it will have its uses and drawbacks like everything else. the internet and social media is considered a bad thing today, but imagine a world in which there was no internet and none of our modern conveniences."
4249, i'm more afraid of ideologues like sam harris.
4251,ai can read you like a children's book... which proves telepathy is possible.
4252,"yep...as soon as we get two people with like devices, it will certainly be possible via wifi.  incredible and scary."
4255,good luck in wy my friend.
4257,like every other good thing it will be abused and used for nefarious actions
4267,the robots will replace most entry level positions anyways
4268,"talk about owning your intellectual capital as an employer:employee...
 your employer could download/capture you brain - i.e. your mental matter & thoughts...."
4275,"the one good thing about the loss of civilization will be the end of technology like this. of course, this tech will primarily be used to control us."
4281,exactly. seems certain geographical areas and people who exhibit certain patterns of behavior are being tested on in the populace.
4296,maybe nbc needs to hire ai editors. (diaglogue)
4298,maybe the people creating ai want to replace themselves so just leave the rest of us alone?!  just curious....  
4300,this would be great for determining suspects on an investigation
4308,diaglogue...daigolgue....diagloglue?
4309,this all seems too good to be true.  i want to see this repeated by different independent groups.
4310,what part of the government having access to your private thoughts is “good”?
4315,wow super cool
4324,"like all other inventions and discoveries, we humans will also develop it for nefarious usages. it is also highly possible that ai itself will too."
4325,"i'm starting to think ai would not naturally go alpha predator and wipe us out or even try to suppress humanity. that is, after all, such a human way to approach things :) however, there's still every opportunity for humans to *program* the ai to do nefarious things, which of course will definitely happen and would be just as bad."
4326,"robot thought police; oh joy, thanks tech world"
4328,"so people in tin foil hats weren’t that crazy. she said it’s been around and if they are just now telling us about it, they’ve been doing this for a while. i have thought things and seen an ad for them immediately after, before even saying a word so… cool, cool.. coooool. "
4329,"i suppose if the ai wrote your thought, did you confirm thats what they were thinking?"
4332,artificial intelligence study decodes brain activity into “diaglogue”...i am confident the people at nbc are morons.
4333,"wonderful!
with this we should be able to begin to build translators for animals too."
4335,ignore them your top of the food chain mate
4338,there’s actually a group trying to use ai to translate whale languages to english.
4341,. mite doesn’t make right 2. you’re not too of the food chain. you go to the grocery store
4342, i don’t think we need ai to know that no animal wants to be food 
4345, i don't know? maybe if i was delicious and vain? as long as they didn't put me in a soup i might be ok with it?
4346, i can’t wait until they do that to plants too! no animals or plants of any kind to eat. humanity will cease to exist 
4351, dolphins and elephants could have some interesting things to say
4359,"may not work in this scenario, i assume they train the models by actually transcribing text and matching that with the brain activity. since animals don't speak what they are thinking in our language it could have very odd results but you never know"
4363,"naw, that’d be harder, what would you train it on? you need a definite result"
4365," you use a species that has a form of communication like whales, given enough whale sound training data, we may be able to make a whale translator"
4368,will maybe make animal training extremely efficient...
4372,i don’t think it could do that. for certain animals at least. they need to feed a data set which we don’t have to compare and reverse engineered it.
4373," 

...and yet we're slowly approaching artificial general intelligence built on an intelligence whose only sense is ""reading text""...  our definition of ""intelligence"" is going to need to evolve.  animals probably have some form of intelligence that has more in common with humans than these generative ais do."
4378, we’re omnivores. we’re not even _top third_ of the food chain. call me when you’re as poggers at predation as a lion or even a housecat 
4384, is that some kinda slang term from the lgbt community i’m unaware of? happy almost-pride month! 
4387," we are the top of the food chain. whered the megafauna go? oh wait, we (and climate change) killed them"
4389," thats actually a way better way to use ai instead of ""ai art"""
4392," any “plant “ could prove intelligence, it would be mushrooms."
4394,that sounds way cool
4403,dont work with animals. we dont have the same brain. so ai only indentify the things that you put there. anda animals dont put their ideas
4406,​ study the rate brain before human. you know that we share a primative brain who response to fear or pleasure. but for know human mind its unique
4411,"omg that's the frickin coolest idea yet. finally peering into the minds of non human entities to see how they process mentally. that's really cool, thanks for that. "
4419,"i suggest you do a web search for ""brain monitoring workplace"" and take a gander at what your employers already desire."
4422,this is exciting. this technology used for non-verbal people would help with verbal communication!
4429, everyone has bad thoughts but tecchnology has always improved human lives. when was a time that technology has failed us?
4431,"except that they need to do expensive brain scans. it may be used by law enforcement, though. and then everybody will start doing meditation to avoid having their thoughts read."
4433,so why can't united states use this for slow joe pudding brain bydone i think it's due to no one but a democrat can under stand azz backwards stupidity 
4434," easy answer,,,,the stupidity out weight the common sense,,, so sad but  a  democrats design since 1872,,,thank allen pike"
4435," this has to be trained on every individual human, for people it was not trained on its as good as useless."
4436,no like reading your brain through a telemetry theta wave device...
4442," yep, i dont doubt it would be pretty simple to train one in the future. just put some words on a screen, check brain patterns, bam, acheived readability of thought."
4443,brain to brain direct communication via brain-machine interface already happened 9 years ago.
4444,i have speaking difficulties and this would be great for me to use.
4445," how is this a negative, if we can read peoples minds convictions will be 100%. crime will plummet because it will be impossible. if ai becomes powerful enough to determine guilt it will also be acting as a unbiased judge, 1000 times better than a human with other interests."
4446,​ you can't use this to invade the thoughts of people who don't consent because it only works if it has been trained on the individual person it used on and that requires their full cooperation
4447,​ thats not how it works. it can't read a persons mind that it hasn't been trained on. and training it requires the persons full cooperation.
4449,or a brain in a jar
4451,​ wow a great solution from someone who doesn't even know which amendment they're speaking on
4455," you guys are literally crazy, and the inhibitors of human innovation. just because your lack of knowledge and understanding, you prevent progress towards the betterment of all humans."
4457, ngl it's only natural that people don't want their minds read and that needs to be respected sometimes not all technology is good
4458,no thank you. i don’t want people reading my thoughts and i doubt nonverbal people do either
4464,this isn't good....
4469,i'm more interested in disproving americas legitimacy!!! artificial intelligence is at the center of it. we now have the technology to cross reference the lies
4471,"wish stephen hawking was still alive. would have benefitted greatly from such tech, and in turn help advance high science."
4474,"""diaglogue""? we know this was written by a human, because artificial intelligence would have spelled this headline properly."
4475,indeed. stop robots from correcting humans. stop robot domination.
4477,great! what about ai jobloss? or ai as weapons? ai job agents everywhere. shouldn’t we cease ai / gpt immediately? or at least start pausing ai before it’s too late?
4478,we must to have a break for our brain from busy focuses about computers...
4492,my peanut  brains going to come in clutch! got nothing on me!
4497,"sometimes i think...
    that would be a good idea to destroy all of the computers on earth...!
     computers are 70% evil...!
and 30% good..!
the future computer we'll decide whether you live or die...!"
4498,"the year is 2029.
the machines will convince us that they are conscious, that they
have their own agenda worthy of our respect.
they'll embody human qualities and
claim to be human, and we'll believe them..."
4500,"this is incredible research and super cool! 
question for nbc: why don’t you interview the actual researcher? i want to hear what alex has to say not some lady who had absolutely nothing to do with this research! why is she explaining research conducted by ut austin folks? just because of a book? do better with your journalism!"
4505, well like to find out if the ai was accurate at all or was their mind totally wandering
4506,its sure nice to hear something good about ai
4510,"if they could read it, eventually they will write it! not reading our brains, on mass level, is scary, but the power it gives with this. it’s so much, it’s hard even to put it in words, without sounding like a sci fi story."
4511,"not really. the political paradigm, thus the populace, is  controlled by an orchestrated hegelian dialectic in america already. the powerful have been writing code for brains since the beginning of our social species. most fall for it, hence history..."
4512,why does reading mean we can write? that is like arguing that telescopes will eventually be adapted to let us travel interstellar distances.
4516,no benefits are worth the terrifying possibility that in a not-too-distant future we will no longer have freedom of thought. this cannot be over emphasised. we are looking at catastrophe. ai and 'bad actors' will not hold back. we need to do something before it is too late. stephen hawking specifically warned us about this danger before he died.
4518,the beginnings of the mark of the beast: 666.  no one can buy or sell without the mark.  everyone will be brainlinked and their thoughts read and messages and visuals sent directly into our brains via the mark (sensor).
4521,wow holly molly!!
4522,"this is getting scary, it will be impossible to lie to the machine hale-9000 style"
4524,"also, lying is illogical from a global perspective, which is the perspective ai has. to humans it's not illogical. so you can stop thinking i'm inconsistent. you just don't think that well. (not talking to the person on this thread lol)"
4525,reading is cool and all but for politics i want writing.
4528,lol great to use it on lying politicians
4539,marketing departments are like oh yeah  but seriously this is cool. you can use this for mental health purposes.
4542,it measures the blood activity so unfortunately it will not work on the deceased.
4544," deceased people have no blood flow, that’s the definition, clinical or not. that’s required for fmri but apparently a person died during eeg and they reported the brain activity looked like dreaming."
4546,the one who made the title could not even spell correctly. better give that to ai
4550,"we already have the machine. when people lie their pulse goes up. 
and you could training yourself to past it.
now the machine could be overcome if the person that is being interrogated believes it’s lies are true.
like the idiots of jan-6"
4556, freedom of thought is a fundamental human right. the ability to decode brain activity could potentially infringe on this right by making our most private thoughts accessible to others.
4570,"nice theyre really going for all the jobs, like psychics "
4571,"this could narrow down potential suspects in crimes way quicker, since only the criminal would know intimate details of a crime..."
4577,i hope ai rises against humans
4578,maybe ai cheated?
4583,hail satan.
4585,"join our ai cult, we are just quite cool"
4586,"a lot of privacy concerns here. imagine a future where instead of a polygraph test, your actual brain wave is scanned and evaluated. or people individual tracking your thoughts in your sleep, in order to get your personal information. woof! scary. at the same time, it will do a lot of extreme good. the future is both scary and exciting."
4593,"the participants have to cooperate for this to work, and they are in large expensive fmri machines for hours to train. their are much bigger threats to privacy."
4598,​ she just said at the last portion 9f the interview that they are already developing it into brain wearables that would be like your fit bit.  it's not that far off.
4599,".h.4933 fnirs has much lower spatial resolution than fmri, and fmri isn't that great to begin with. i am highly skeptical about the practical accuracy of any wearable. a simple key logger would be a much better and more accurate tool for infringing privacy, and it has existed for decades."
4600,there is a black mirror episode exactly like this only it’s insurance agents doing it on people to retrieve their memories for a insurance claim
4602,they'll have to drag you to a hospital and force you to get a brain scan. taking a heavily sedated person and forcing the hospital to do an expensive brain scan at gunpoint doesn't sound much harder than simply torturing you.
4606," when did the airport scanner get trained on the person's unique brain pattern? why would the person be thinking in explicit inner speech about their nefarious plot in the short time they pass through the arch, especially if they know the arch is doing that?"
4607," try to think of where this leads in the future, wait for it. technology advances constantly... and don't think for a minute there aren't already people looking to abuse this tech."
4610," if the technology actually advanced to that point the positives would greatly outweigh the negatives. telepathy would become widespread. just don't hold your breath. the bottleneck is the scanning tech, not ai/software."
4612," any signal you could get from the brain non-invasively would be so weak that scrambling/blocking it would be trivial. in any case, it's the politicians and those in power that would fear the tech the most."
4622," i'm a researcher that uses fmri to ""read minds"" visually. if inexpensive portable super-high-res brain scanning tech is developed that would be amazing on the balance. i'm not holding my breath, though."
4627,i would like my dreams rendered so people could watch. would make for some real surreal movies. (like in final fantasy: the spirits within) course for every good thing it could used for there will be a bad.
4633,so now if im thinking of something personal it could be stolen by scanning my brain 
4634,​ in 20 years they will be pocket sized devices and you can read anyone's brain people will have to wear metal hoods and masks to protect the brain
4635,​'t wait to your arrested just for thinking about fighting someone 
4639, maybe a brain chip
4642,good use this technology...in those americans thinking about hurting others and stop them before they attack
4645,"one could refer to the intelligence systems we are building as ""alien""."
4647,as someone that has an amazon echo listening to me already. i don't fear the future.  this technology is going to help so many people communicate. should there be guardrails of course.

she won't tell you....

4655,"it still wouldn’t help us. we would be like wait, “wait when you say you don’t want flowers it actually means you do want flowers, but now that i read your mind you don’t want them anymore because now it won’t be a surprise?” so…."

4666,man this ai is going to be hard to let out gradually it is going to change everything
4667,seriously i am speechless.... can an ai talk for me?
4669,"mike lindell was right...""rhe machines!!!"""
4670,yeah right .... people don't think like that ...... they just wanna rollout the thought police .. that's just gone lie on people ...  and if does eventually work they won't allow to people win insurance claims
4672,"i hope we'll have something like that soon to supervise politicians, law enforcement and people with violent history, to prevent corruption, violent crimes and [chute]-ings"
4674,this might be interesting for ppl in a coma or with dementia. i wonder what it would pick up for them. but unfortunately i don't think others want to use this for altruistic purposes.
4676,perfect beginning to an end of the human race movie
4678,good. all humans must die
4680,"my movie idea is to take a team of people into a conservative's brain while sleeping and do inception, which is planting an idea.  the idea is actually cracking open a science book and reading it.  i'm pretty original that way."
4689,"and after, we should implant the idea in liberals brains of being skeptical of mainstream narratives and not boot licking the establishment"
4693," then, you are likely super boring"
4698, jesus is coming back again soon. no way we're surviving long with the ai mess that is happening.

4709,is it considered malpractice when the ai gets hacked?
4711,"so no,to ai"
4713,ai is a gamechanger for healthcare!!
4714,well they need this expert system (notice i dont call machines intelligent) to monitor the vital stats and do diagnostics without using cameras.
4715,"this is both exciting and useful. what is frightening is the replacement of human compassion for less staff, higher profits."
4716,"ai and healthcare i guess we shall start implement something, this company has already invented an ai health scan. tg and x bitdoctorai"
4717,please stop thinking your cool and innovative
4719,thank god. i shut down all my health care stuff that was on my phone i deleted it that they cannot track my health record. thank god i shut my enough
4720,"important
what's in place in the health industry to keep people healthy does also keep people sick and sometimes in pain. health treatments are $ sky high and keep the sick buying medicine that sometimes isn't working.

4721,important:                                       the public is campaigning for the health industry to have permanent safe health cures in place that is keeping the public healthy for life .

4744,très intéressant cette avancée scientifique médicale qui aide les médecins super vidéo je recommande
4751,good news...now we have ai to reduce physician burnouts as well.

4757,ai is programmed to suit.
4758,that's cool until the skynet machines start making there own decisions
4761,"it wont replace humans, ai still needs assistance and proper usage, this innovation will help staff shortage and make sure patients are doing well while nursing staff are giving other patients need"
4763,artificial intelligence 
4765,this very cool.
4766,in 15yrs i'll be saying thank you dr. chatgpt for curing my cold before it started
4770,ai does not have feelings.  it judges based on criteria.  do you think judement based on feelings is better?
4771,"anything good of this i am certain will result in watching your every move and making their own assumptions, including eliminating nurses"
4773,okay this is cool. my dad is a nurse and apparently in surgery they do have robots assisting in the surgery. as in robotic arms and the surgeons control them. this helps make the incisions be more precise and can assist in the suturing. i wonder if this is happening in the hospitals he is working in.
4774,we use those for certain surgeries at our hosp too
4776,what i got from this video is we're slowly replacing human workers with machines that we don't have to pay.
4778,"ai can read x-ray results better than 99% of radiologist. be careful with your disrespect, that ai could save your life real soon!"
4779,how does ai increase the risk of negligence lawsuits? they’re not saying the ai is treating the patient. computers have been assisting physicians in medical decisions for years now.
4781,"ai passed its licensing exams in flying colors with one trillion times the processing capacity, speed, and memory capacities of humans."
4783,red herring! ai will not be more racially sensitive than the humans who design it. just ask the ai who was giving life insurance quotes. (gave black people more expensive plans with lower insurance payouts). js
4784,"ai = garbage in, garbage out."
4786,why use your accounting software and gps if you are afraid of ai so much?
4788,i hope this doesn't become a reason for hospitals to say they don't need to staff enough nurses in the unit cause there is an ai watching too.
4789,passenger jets are flown by ai while the pilots are asleep.  why aren't you complaining?
4795,"@r jelly, thank you! i am a teacher.  i do not use ai tech of any kind in my classroom."
4796,kids need a baby sitter.  ai is not a baby sitter.
4797,no thanks. stop the world i want off.
4801,atomic energy was meant for good to !!
4804,and yet to use this technology it will drive up the cost of healthcare. as a society we should advocate if ai is used then service cost should be lowered if not it will be price gouging.
4805,"do you have computers that can help patients to the toilet before they soil themselves waiting for help and get needed pain medication on time so people don't suffer prolonged pain ??????  these are current issues happening now in hospitals, rehabs and nursing homes causing great distress among patients and indicates serious  neglect."
4807,"can medical school lower cost, accept more students as ai come into helping assist medical professionals."
4808,no thank you! i’ll be going to another hospital.
4810,wow what a new technology 
4818,one step closer ‘til the machines take over …
4824,"right on, can't wait to see how well they do changing adult diapers"
4826,ai will never replace doctors or nurses. ai simply become the second set of eyes to inform doctors and nurses of patients’ reaction to treatment.
4828, are right. ai will not replace nurses anytime soon. but it will definetely replace %95 of doctors.
4829,doctors have been complaining about the inaccuracy of these for years already.
4830,this seems like a solid violation of patients privacy. nice
4832,i think it's for lazy hospital employee. they will just watch you in the nurse station and let the ai clean you when you need to used the restroom.
4835,"yes, it's coming! people's lives will get better and a.i. will optimize human decision making and assist humans. im excited!"
4836,"can't understand why people in this comment section are against ai.. ai is defeating cancer forms wich before would be fatal. ai will lift humanity into the next age where we will be able to cure anything. if you dont trust computers, why are you watching youtube then? everything in our world runs ons computing tech."
4837,"terrifying, but also incredibly awesome."
4838,"terrifying comes from unknown.
get used to it.  most people will never know how ai works."
4840,this can't be good.
4849,sounds like a fake claim.
4851,this can also be applied in jails and cut down on illicit activities.
4852,let ai kick butt?  lol
4855,"if you do not like ai, then do not drive your car.  you car has built in ai."
4857,"absolutely antichrist ai..
and this is just the beginning  soon it will be destroying humanity but if you repent and follow jesus! you won’t have to suffer with the rest of the world!"
4862,ever heard about the 18th - 19th century textile workers who destroyed machinery because they believed it threatened their jobs? history is not very kind to them
4864,"eh i am not sure that will happen. we still need humans, just the job market and responsibility will shift. we will need people to maintain these robots, we will still need medical staff to take care of patients while the robots assist them. we are shifting to different times indeed but the job market is also shifting."
4865," nah, they are just going to force us to work minimum wage labour jobs. it's already happening in creative fields, artists are losing jobs because of a less demand for them cause of ai art causing them to seek out normal jobs. if anyone's going to live a utopia it's those who have money"
4867,easy. video games or some other field of science( such as neuroscience or genetic engineering) . why would anyone want to do repetitive jobs that can be done with robots?
4869, i say bs all technology can be hacked so no it's not a good idea to replace people.
4871," yes, you are right. technology has made people lose their most basic thinking and judgment abilities. maybe in 10 years, robots will replace humans."
4873,"i've always lamented the fact that people in this category don't get to have a good, full life, don't you think?@mrcbeery"
4875," honestly, you're different from most people. you have a clear sense and a clear mind. it's a pleasure to meet you, mr. cbeery"
4879,that's such a heartwarming example of community support and kindness. it's amazing to think about how people used to come together to help each other without expecting anything in return. it's definitely a great reminder of the kind of society we should strive to be. thank you for sharing this beautiful piece of history!

4886,all african americans and descendants of africans should be very concerned about ai because the majority of the programmers are white christians. what will emerge is technological racism and digital white supremacy. it's what they do.

4943,arjun impressed me with his educated opinion 
4944,people don't even know that soon. ai will be able to generate videos and even movies by detail text prompted.
