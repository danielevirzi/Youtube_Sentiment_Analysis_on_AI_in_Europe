I have worked in ML for the last 6 years. I am deep into this stuff. LLM have no planning and reasoning abilities: none, zero. It just happen that they incurgitated so much textual data that it feels like they can reason. But they can‚Äôt. They just spit out the most probable words given the input prompt. There is no internal mechansim of causation. We need another breakthrough to get to AGI. We are still far from it. Current LLMs are super useful but they definitely make a lot of mistakes. Agents are definitely a good research area but as of today their outputs far from perfect and needs a lot of editing.

Because ""thinking"" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to ""replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.""[6] Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a three-person game called the ""imitation game"", in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players.

Meaning, without Ai, we would never have been able to achieve this landmark in a thousand lifetimes.

Besides, AI is already being used to harness its own input data. Text data apparently has been exhausted, and thus OpenAI's Whisper is scraping all podcasts, and video scrapping is on the way. From there we have CCTVs...

The whole point of LLMs is to create general learning capabilities so that one does not need to perfect data in order to train on a new skill. Given the number emergent properties of LLMs one can say that there is already some success on that front. Can LLMS evolve into AGI? Perhaps, perhaps not. Does anyone truly believe we won't further refine our approaches in the future? 

There is no question that AI could bring us an age of abundance, and solve untold numbers of problems. There are similarly bad outcome scenarios that there is no coming back from. We need to move forward with care.

Personally, I think Nuclear is the best analogy we have. It can great power plants, perhaps even infinite energy via fusion. Someone irresponsible also could use it to bomb society into oblivion. Imagine a world without safeguards on that?

He was inspired to start an AI company due to his parents' scientific work and his own background in programming. AI requires large-scale, high-quality data sets to power applications, and this data requires human insight and guidance to be accurate. AI is being used to automate tasks that require vast amounts of data, such as predicting the weather, and is being used to help humans in healthcare by analyzing data and flagging any abnormalities to doctors.

A malevolent dystopia is more like caused by humans saying they care about profit above all else, making an AI that decides killing people and paying a fine is more profitable, and follows its programming.

It needs energy, raw materials and tools. All those three are areas where full automaticity can be achieved and humanity works toward it voluntarily. So basically it needs few nuclear, solar or windmill plants. It needs many autonomous mining companies and machines and lots of custom built robots for maintenance. And finally some autonomous factories with lots robots. Basically it should want to develop optimal components to build better machines/robots to to harvest more materials to increase its processing speed and memory capacity to become even smarter. Yes this AGI will need many things to work seamlessly, but being super intelligent it can figure out this logistics clockwork fairly quickly. And being very smart it probably figures out that it needs also protection against mankind. But I guess it doesn't want or need to kill humankind but just protect its self. As long as we don't threaten its existence we should be mostly OK. Some population control is probably needed though, but this can be achieved without any violence or opposition by letting people just live their hedonistic lifestyle until many die because of poor health.

'AI' isn't actually artificial intelligence, rather a buzzword to get people excited about the potential of generative algorithms. If you're using that argument then humans, also, are mostly not able of creating anything that hasn't been heard before. Besides, there are other algorithms that don't fall directly, and in a marketing sense, into Generative AI. There are algorithms that generate random music from possible note combinations. Those are not _trained_ on existing music, meaning It does not feed anything into the algorithm. The algorithm is basically static and just uses math to generate a sequence of notes based on ideas like the circle of fifths and so on. 

Other algorithms use prime, rare prime, weird numbers, etc to generate music for years now. Your initial statement was very limited in scope. You should read about these other algorithms and I'd bet you'd be surprised at what they do. I can almost guarantee you've never heard anything like it.",2023-11-26T19:02:30Z

Humans draw from a wider well, and they mutate what they hear. It's not just music that inspires humans, it's experience. AI is incapable of writing something that captures the human experience, which is the whole point of art. A human musician isn't just inspired by music, they're inspired by the beauty of a sunset, the chills on their skin from heroin, the touch of a woman, an interest in a particular subject, a paragraph in a book. AI is and always will be, incapable of translating those things into an abstract representation through sound. These experiences, interests, taste, etc. they're all filtered through the unique lens of an individual which again is something AI is incapable of recreating.

Also fuck it, I'll go indepth because you're wrong about how it works. AI in its current form is a pattern recognition algorithm in reverse. Rather than recognising a pattern, its creates a pattern based on what it is being asked to recognise. It learns how to recognise patterns by being trained on existing data, which is why it will never making anything new. Whatever you're talking about isn't what AI is right now. You can't just use an understanding of the circle of fifths to ""make the pixies in the style of frank sinatra"" or whatever the fuck people do with AI.",2024-04-18T02:17:59Z

Generative AI can do that as well, it's not like sampling. AI music generation is not yet at the level of AI image generation (which is already completely out of this world after only a few years of existing), but it's just a question of when, not if. I'm not saying this is a good thing, but you have to face this new reality at some point.",2024-04-18T02:17:59Z
2023-12-13T04:09:00Z,@highestsettings,M1_jiUjxbIc,"@@Mussi93 Something that doesn't sound like anything anybody has heard before. AI can't do that, but humans can. It makes pastiches. It's not capable of anything more now, and it never will be, at least not using the current technology. I'm aware that every artist is inspired by something (I believe I even said something to that effect), but we mutate and mix the inspirations into something else. There are examples of music unlike anything anybody has ever heard before. Using the same 12 notes and the same harmonic structure and the same instruments with the same sounds. People are still able to make music that is fresh and unique. Sometimes the leap is small, sometimes the leap is large. But any great artist makes some kind of leap that nobody else took before. AI as it is right now will never be able to do that.

I understand the technology, I know how it works, I've used it myself. That's why I'm saying what I'm saying so confidently. AI isn't even really AI. It's not intelligent, it doesn't understand anything, it doesn't know what it's doing. It's reverse pattern recognition. Instead of recognising what a pattern is and telling you what it is, you tell it what the pattern is and it generates something that fits a pattern that it recognises will match your input. 

And for the record, people have been saying ""any day now"" for years and years, I'll believe it when I see it. To create art as good as or better than a human artist who is truly creative  that's going to require an entirely new technology to achieve. Until then, even if they make it so it doesn't fuck up in ways that anybody with a discerning eye or ear can almost immediately notice, it will still only be a replacement for stock and corporate ""art"".",2024-04-18T02:17:59Z

The ""AI"" you're referring to are _specifically designed_ to make only those pastiches and nothing else. They're not designed for truly artistic purposes, rather for imitation of well known genres and songs on demand. That's why you feel that way.

The point of these Generative AI systems is to not only show what the capabilities of machine learning are, but also _to make money...._ eventually. That means they need it to be productive and predictable as far as quality of product, so it's able to shit out a hit song, given the right parameters by the user.

That would certainly entice others to give it a try as well, like a lottery, hoping they've got the magic combination of words to go viral. This is not a formula for being unique. We shouldn't expect that to make something unique in the form of music.

There are plenty of other algorithms out there that do things humans actually can't do at all and they generate distinctly unique music like nothing you've ever heard. Now whether anyone feels it is musical is another thing altogether. 

Once we've achieved true, sentient, artificial intelligence there's absolutely no doubt it will surpass human capabilities in many fields.",2024-04-18T02:17:59Z
2023-12-18T05:34:28Z,@highestsettings,M1_jiUjxbIc,"@@yargnad You realise that you're saying exactly the same thing as me but framing it as if you're arguing with me right?

Also, that's a different problem in and of itself. It's removing yet another revenue stream from artists, who already have a tough time making money. First you had graphic printing, photography and recorded music, etc. Then you had digital distribution and streaming, which all led to more work for the best and less work for everyone else. Now this. Most people who aren't creative would just say ""get a real job"", ignoring the fact that being an artist is a real job, but also not realising that asking an artist to work in a factory is like asking a doctor or a any other highly skilled form of worker to do the same. The lack of revenue streams for artists makes it harder for artists to even try to be an artist (you spend 10 years of your life dedicated to learning your craft, only to find out that there arent any ways for you to make money doing it). There's also the fact that the creative flair a real person brings to commercial work has the potential to make everything more interesting. Not to mention the fact that creative people who can't be creative become soulless husks, and when you have a job, only the most dedicated people have the time and effort for much else.

If AI and robots could replace every job, it wouldn't be so bad, because then artists could use AI to make money in more traditional ways allowing them to work on their craft regardless of the financial benefits of it.",2024-04-18T02:17:59Z

The main premise is bending the highest string off of the neck and then bouncing it off of the neck pickup (as it won't produce an audible pitch until it makes contact with a surface) while playing with the tremolo bar. You can move your fretting hand up the string as you're doing it and it will increase in pitch the further up you go and decrease in the opposite direction.   

It won't usually snap if you're slow and careful with how you approach moving the strong off of the neck",2023-10-04T21:16:26Z

You don‚Äôt need a whammy pedal to do this (although Johnny does use one in this show, he hasn‚Äôt in others and got much the same sound), the string is not detuned, he doesn‚Äôt have any device to take it out of the bridge (you can hear him manually pulling the string out off the fretboard before each instance), and there is concert footage of him snapping his string when doing this.

Slam your high E against a pickup (especially a telecaster neck single) and see what sound you get. You get this same sound. What he‚Äôs doing is coming at the pickup with the string off the fretboard but with tension on the string to keep the angle and the sound frequencies where they need to be. It‚Äôs not easy, it is risky, it‚Äôs more low tech than you think, and even the man himself has snapped more than a few strings doing it. But that‚Äôs the beauty of what he does. It‚Äôs wild.

For reference, search for ‚Äúthe bends string incident‚Äù on here. You‚Äôll see he was not set up for a whammy pedal, and that he broke his string. The entire process is shown with a camera that fixes on him even well after he snaps his string.",2023-12-24T06:25:28Z

The endorsement part and the easier diagnosing part can be handled by AI, but guessing what the patient's actual problem is from disconnected clues not only demands mastery over years of education but also sheer instinct backed up by experience and some serious mental gymnastics and out-of-the-box thinking. Moreover, no two patients are the same, and there will always be changes made to some standardized care plan to cater to individual patients. Moreover, automating the hospital Iron Man or Elon style would be prohibitively expensive and cumbersome and extremely spatially-demanding and would leave room for lots of mistakes, and would require planners to think of every possible gap in the machinery that could possibly manifest. Another reason why AI wouldn't be able to completely take over would be if there's a patient emergency, like, the patient is dying so much that immediate medical action needs to be taken. Stuff needs to be injected to correct physiological anomalies and chemical imbalances, CPR is conducted, etc. If a robot were to conduct those actions, there will be a high risk that it overperforms and hurts the patient even more, whereas a human nurse can apply urgency to the same actions and yet somehow be able to adjust so as to not hurt the patient that much. Another reason why a hospital wouldn't be completely taken over by AI and automation would be that at some point in time, it'll expand, and if it was automated, a lot of moving stuff will need to be done, way more than if the hospital wasn't that automated.

Extreme summary, which can actually be generalized to other fields of work: a human can be more efficient at certain jobs than robots. Especially in jobs that require a lot of doing rather than thinking.",2024-03-09T17:33:33Z

AI is not a program with code that humans wrote. AI is a mathematical model that was built from very simple rules to train them how to do things in the same way humans learn: trial and error and reward and punishment. The models are so complex that we don't even understand how they do what they do. We know how we built them, but we don't understand how they work.

My gut is telling me that what will happen is this: AI will generate options for the dentist (diagnosis, evalulations, etc), and robotics will automate a lot of the cleaning, surgery, etc. The dentist will be there mainly to spotcheck any
""medical opinion"" of the AI but still be the ultimate responsible party. But thanks to the accuracy and efficiency of AI and robotics, a single dentist can handle far more patients and in less time with supurb accuracy. So, there will likely be less demand for dentists overall.

IT or software engineering or the like may be a good bet, but the problem that I see is how one chooses a career path that is viable? Most, if not all, junior level positions will be wiped out. The junior of the near future will have to perform at the level of today's senior. Any job I can think of this field that exists today, I can not guarantee that it will exist in 5 years.

That said, labor markets are always in flux. The only solid recommendation I can offer is this: learn how to use AI. The first people to lose their jobs and blindsided by all this will be knowledge workers who don't use AI.

You are possibly correct with stating in the title that AI will never replace ""our"" jobs, meaning your viewers, who are probably young and in tech or similar. But there's a certain difference in this industrial revolution compared to the ones before. The birth of the steam engine, the assembly line, or the computer had a huge impact on the way people worked and it surely made lives easier by replacing hard physical work. Workers could be easily trained to use the innovation, there was always a place for that worker in that company. This ai-revolution though replaces hard mental work. Stuff that people studied over years and maybe decades. There is no way, that people in the industry, who are comfortable with their routines, who are already in their 40s, 50s or 60s, can perform this amount of work in order to remain in their fields. Jobs created by ai will always be mentally demanding jobs, or creative jobs, that will be risky. As an example can accountants be easily replaced. And everything similar to the work of an accountant. Accountants need to resaddle to something completely new, using lots of mental effort. Not physical this time. This is the discussion german philosophers and industrial experts having at this moment. And why people like Elon Musk demand for basic incomes. To sum it up. Young tech people can adapt to ai-revolution. But most of older people, which carry the country on their backs, which jobs get replaced, can not easily resaddle to work in the jobs created by ai.",2023-09-04T20:46:10Z

But the counter argument is that AI is fundamentally different from any kind of automation that we have faced before and by approaching a place of AGI most workers will be no longer necessary. 
There's a big difference between a series of robot arms in a Tesla factory or a self driving car and a true AGI which can generalize and reason its way to solve complex problems.
People can keep wanting more but market demand will control what's built. Society could shift towards one of extreme inequality where production is placed on luxury goods for the mega elite instead of average people. This is a viable economic model as we've seen  countries like South Africa with gigantic wealth gaps and we could logically expect even larger ones driven by a mainly automated society.

The problem is you're comparing automation to past examples and not what it has potential to become (Ex: factory workers). Past performance can't predict future results. Right now neither the AI doomers nor the optimists can say with certainty how the job market will be affected long term.

To make things worse, housework has shrunk by 70-80% and child labor is virtually eliminated. On top of that, people over 65 had a drastic drop in their employment rate from 65% to a mere 20%. Even worse, total employment rates have also started to decline, especially after 2008. There is one thing for sure, in terms of total hours, we are working less, much less, and the trend has no sign of slowdown. Total number of jobs did not decrease because of drastic decreases working hours per capita accompanied with increasing productivity, as well as marketization of domestic work. Funny thing is that there is no more room to go. Practically all domestic work is already marketed, there are more single people than married already. There is no more child labor to rid, while the number of retirees working are no more shrinking but on the rise. Given all that, unemployment is bound to rise, employment is bound to decrease.

We have been able to create an enhanced physical form through the field of mechanics and it allowed 1 man to do the work many used to take because the physical enhancement allowed manipulating the physical world to no longer be the bottleneck and instead it is the data processor that is the limiter. What happens when you give a tool that allows 1 data processor to do a task that once took many?

It is blindly optimistic to say ""We will figure something out for them to do"" when a vast majority of today's population don't even know what a for loop is and yet somehow unemployment won't be an issue because they'll all acquire lucrative high paying jobs from these companies, jobs you say you can't fathom now but are SURE will come (this to me sounds like quackery as this type of argument structure, I have seen in many anti-gmo or whatever argument). With this line of thinking I can say AI may be unable to handle edge cases now but 30 years ago it wasn't able to create pictures and we could not imagine how computers would ever be able to.

Sure, factories today still hire individuals to work there, but the work they do is so fundamentally different to what it used to be that mechanical automation did take jobs, it just provided new ones for others with different skill sets.

It's totally proven that every single textbook you've ever learned from is says Rockefeller right on the inside of the textbook; check for yourself - 1st page on all of them .

So far beyond obvious, I mean anyone who disagrees with me that inflation has not doubled is beyond brainwashed is pretty scary to think of that kind of brainwashed idiot is our future. I don't believe that with AI we're going to get information that is a result of MAJOR BRAINWASHING. That's why AI is so better suited than human beings to govern to help manage the resources on this planet and the distribution thereof.  Inflation is only 2% up from last year?  Well guess what? Over a 3 to 4-year period inflation is actually up 200%!! The cost of a home is now unaffordable and out of reach as a single family home on average $100,000 more than it was about 3 to 4 years ago. and I've watched the real estate market avidly for the last 5 years. Cost of a car is on average about 15% more and the cost of living itself. In other words, the system is imploding in on itself and it will fall because all empires do.

school"".üòÇ

Many; well over 30 or so pilot base income projects have been ongoing all over and  proved statistically successful; proving that people don't waste money and sit around lay around they get up pay their bills and they get that extra job or they start that business. Whatever it is they want to do. They go back to college. It's already been proven that ongoing pilot project local giving of money to people in need has done wonders for that person and their entire community throughout the United States and abroad. And AI has already taken about if you had to put in a percentage and this is not scientific. Just my opinion. I'd put it at about 30%, maybe 40% and probably 50% in the upcoming year of 2024.

What we have now is a stage where AI will handle so much of the mental element of work that many job categories will be downsized or completely removed and none will be created except for AI aligners (fancy word for humans who just check the vibe of the AI output). So we might not completely erase programmers but 100s of programmers will be replaced with one head programmer of a large company and their AI tool.

2023-08-28T18:54:39Z,@nitro8529,zu3oklVMOo4,"Sorry, but what your stating here is bullshit. And for some parts, youre either lying or very uneducated in some topics. 

First: In the first part of your video, youre literally comparing apples with pears. Yes, humanity has always invented things that made life easier, correct. But agriculture, cars, TVs, or a smartphone, couldnt actually replace a human and werent invented to do so. Humans still needed to invent, develop and produce stuff. So everything you brought up in that whole segment, is offtopic and hasnt got any value in discussing, whether we have to be affraid of AI replacing us. 

Second: Sorry buddy, just because your country totally screwed up the industrial automation, doesnt mean its like that everywhere. In my country (Germany) automation is happening since a good 20 years and since than, rapidly moving forward, to the point where there are companies, that run on mimimal personal to maintain and repair the robots and machinery, so a couple of electricians are the only guys working there. Instead of hundrets or thousands of humans working there, its just industrial robots and machines working 24/7 without a break and without being paid... And the electricity bill and maintainance cost are far less than the cost for workers. 
So its blatently wrong to say the automation never happened, just cause your country is still decades behind the rest of the world. 

Fun fact: You like German cars??? Audi, Volkswagen (VW), BMW, Mercedes Benz... Porsche??? Guess how they are manufactured... 

Heres an example of the BMW car factory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7fi4hP_y80

So ok, if you read that far, thanks, but you might ask yourself: ""who is this German guy and what qualifies him to talk about such topics anyways?""... Im an electronics engineer with almost 15 years of experience and i work for one of the companies, that to this day, has almost replaced 50% of the human workers with robots of all sorts. So when i chose my career path a looooong time ago, i was already thinking about: ""Do i want to be the person that is going to be replaced by a robot, or do i want to be the person that is developing, programming and building such robots?""
Because if you state otherwise or not, automation is actually a threat to all factory workers in Germany. And a lot of European countries as well.
So far, as sad as it sounds, i didnt find a single industrial job/ workplace, that we couldnt actually develop a robot for, that was faster, stronger, more reliable and put simply ""better"" as a human would have been. 

So sorry if im a bit offensive, but what you state in your video is horribly wrong and dangerously uneducated, because youre downplaying a real threat here. AI will be coming, im certain itll happen within my lifetime and when it happens, it has unforseen consequences to EVERYTHING... Cause this is actually, without joking, without over exaggerating, the first time in human history, something humans developed, that might be capable, of running everything without human intervention. An AI could design a robot from scratch, send the data to an automated factory, produce a functioning industrial robot, write the program for it itself, deliver it somewhere with an AI driven truck... In case you didnt get it, you still to this day, need human workers to do all those tasks... After we have a real, functioning, highly developed AI, every single workplace in the industrial sector is at risk of becoming obsolete. The heads behind the automation, jobs that till now, couldnt have been done by anything else than humans, could become obsolete.  

Take a look at the writers strike in the US in the moment. AI has proven to be capable of scriptwriting, im pretty sure the Hollywood studios are having a deep long look into what AI is capable in this field right now. So the writers might be the first, to push themselves into becoming obsolete, as soon as the first company announces, their AI has written the perfect script for a movie. Hollywood has lost so much money with shitty movies that had horrible scripts, that they surely are willing to give it a try... 
Also AI can paint, it can write poetry and do sculptures... So even creative work like arts is already lost to AI... 

As im a big scifi fan, things like Terminator or Matrix spring into my mind. 

SO ONCE WE DEVELOPED A REAL, SELF AWARE AI, THE AI DOESNT NEED HUMANS ANY LONGER... The AI can code, we put everything in place for it to send information everywhere (internet), we have fully automated factories, at least the machine overlords will need an electrician to maintain everything, so its bye bye humanity, while i become a fleshy, biological, human slave of the AI overlords...",2023-08-28T18:54:38Z

A divide between people who can use technology and those who can‚Äôt. Ironically AI is really good at white collar tech work relative to other stuff.

The bar for what‚Äôs required to be a productive employee, one that can use AI to multiply productivity is higher. A lot of average people might not be better than a few people who can use AI effectively (in terms of white collar jobs). This means companies won‚Äôt hire them or their value is a lot lower and thus their wage.

But maybe we can all learn and become better, and more new jobs are born than lost, and this gain in productivity is more evenly distributed.

In the long term though, I think AGI is achievable and real, and only with hubris can we think the human brain is the most intelligent structure that can ever exist.

Over the years, it has grown so much that now 4 TB storage is very common. But considering the difference in sizes, there are people who still find 4 TB drives to not be enough - because the file sizes increase alongside the increase in storage capacity. There was a time when movies are available in 750 MB sizes, now it's in excess of several GBs. This is similar to AI. While it is capable of doing a lot of things, there are other requirements that will be needed and be handled by people.",2023-08-27T15:05:23Z

Also, higher image quality is the biggest driver for the increase in movie filesizes. It takes a lot more data to make that pretty 4k movie than it did a 480i dvd.",2023-11-26T03:22:18Z

And my point is that in each of historic cases automation failed cause there were always edge cases,... things that humans could handle and computer algorythms couldn't and it's the same with LLMs right now. But future AGI systems will be able to do everything, that humans can. If it's possible for brain to do something, then it's also possible for ai.

2023-08-26T09:16:27Z,@CharlesBrown-xq5ug,zu3oklVMOo4,"Civilization may have progressed enough to conquer the second law of thermodynamics. Civilization needs to strive for this goal with synergistic interdisciplinary teams.The outcome would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. There would be no loss¬†of energy as it changes form. For example the total quantity of thermal energy in an equal pair of two thermal energy reserves with ideal insulation would remain the same regardless of how heat is distributed between the two and how often the distribution of heat between the two is changed. For example in oe case one reserve could contain ice water while the other reserve¬†contained hot water; in another case both reserves could contain tepid water. The redistribution of heat between members of pairs with the same total thermal energy would be free. Diversity, time, and energy are different atributes. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car …ìacks it out without time reversal. 

The second law of thermodynamics had a distinct begining with Sir Isaac Newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flows towards the cold room beyond. 

Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, reliable, and easy to¬†position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas L√©onard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy using evidence from steam engine development. 

These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.¬† This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. 

The law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference in temperature, pressure, or electricity's amperes and volts 

Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems¬† this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI readability. Hypothetically, diode depletion regions are¬† practical sites for enabling mobile electrons energized into motion by thermal electrical noise to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. The thermal electrical noise is hypothetically beyond the¬†¬† exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion)¬†¬†¬† equlibrium thickness of the depletion region; thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. 

Consistantly oriented diodes in parallel hypothetically are successful electrical Maxwell's Demons or Smoluchowski's Trapdoors. The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. There would therefore be usable net rectified power from each and every diode connected together into a consistantly oriented parallel group. The group would aggregate the net power of its members. Any diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat, more efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is switched off has no energy conversion and no performance. 

The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter. 

Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. 

Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. 

Ever since the supposedly universal second law of thermodynamics was formulated, education has mass produced and spread the conventional wisdom throughout society that the second law of thermodynamics is absolute. 

If counterexamples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electric motors with the mechanisms they¬†power, and electric ligts so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. 

Cell¬†phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Electronic minting would be energy cheap. 

Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and p≈ïepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independent power. Shielding and separation would provide EMP resistance. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. 
Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnideetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough clean cheanetary minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. 

This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious and unified civilization.¬†It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this. 

I filed for a patent, us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.¬† It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. 

the patent wasn't developed because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attrbution for the original works of creators. Uncorrupted copies would be released on request. No further action would be taken by this institution. 

Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also the obvious is unpatentsable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. 

Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain here. 

These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive.

There is a big diference between other revolutions and AI, for ex agricultural revolution only afected one sector of life while AI is much more expansive.
Even in agricultural revolution is easy to say, hey we survived... yes we did, cant expect to people just die, they flocked to towns in search of work, conditions worse but its food on the table and many did not make it?

Automated driving, several companies are in this pie, google recently started to charge for automated taxis (s francisco i believe), is this the end of the driver? not yet but less and less will be riquired, what will those middle aged drivers do to suport their families in a few years? is there any plan for it? no, because there is hardly any regulation

The excuse i most like is, oh only the mediocre will sufer... lol the human hubris never stops to amaze me, im so good that nothing can replace me.

It's also an easy way to sort of differentiate ppl who actually understand the nuts n bolts to those who are just jumping on the bandwagon - if someone liberally uses the term AI and not ML or LLM then i take what they say with a grain of salt.

And if you mean that human labor has decreased as a percent of gross production, sure. But that was the intention. Machines were meant to multiply the output of humans. We made tractors so that farming would be easier. Now we can farm more land, in less time. That the point! 

The debate is not whether machines and AI will be even more productive in the future. You seem to think they will make humans obsolete. You need to show evidence of that.

The biggest disagreement I have with you is that you consider AI to be simply another technology. Like a new printer or an AC. 

We‚Äôre attempting to create brains here. The whole reason we want ever more things is because we have brains and a capacity to think and create. If humanity achieves AGI, it doesn‚Äôt matter what other technologies we might want. The AI will simply create them for us, organise the supply chain alone, find a way to manufacture them, etc.

It truly is bound to be our last technology in my opinion. Now, of course that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôll lay around doing nothing all day. But I think the types of jobs that will exist will be very few and scattered apart.

Because, again, it fundamentally doesn‚Äôt matter what we humans might want. AGI can think, create, organise, plan and manufacture it for us.

All past revolutions freed up time and labour for humanity to use their brains into solving other problems or developing new thoughts and arts. Humanity could spent time and resources into other stuff, that created more stuff, that required new, and more skilled, labour. We swapped human muscle for animal muscle and then for mechanical muscle, but the human brain was always behind it. This time a techonology is challenging that. All of that, even the artistic/creativity part of it that we thought would be always inherently ours.
 It won't be as fast as we thought when ChatGPT was 98% accurate but it won't be ""just another stepped improvement"" now that is just 2% accurate (for whatever reason). 
Besides, this is the first technology with a capacity to improve itself, we have no precedent for that.
I don't see a genocidal AI in the near future because even if the potential is there, it is also easily preventable; but the economic disruption of AI could be total the moment we achieve an AGI as capable as any human.

2023-08-25T22:00:24Z,@yehitecharts,zu3oklVMOo4,"It's not necessarily the current state of AI that we should be overly concerned with or placing our greatest estimates upon. It's the future state that many companies are actively spending billions on. I've had my finger on the pulse of this for the past few months as I recently started an AI company. 

What I can tell you as that people are being heavily funded and working rigorously and tirelessly to improve the overall infrastructure of AI capable hardware as you can see with NVIDIA and it's competitors like Kneron, and the net results in training and inference speeds will be massive, we're seeing greater experimentation with MoE and other ensemble-type AI systems which will greatly improve reasoning, we can kind of compare current AI structures to that of maybe insect brains but we're rapidly working toward something more like mammalian brains with distinctly different sections working in unison to produce a desired outcome, we're even seeing new and promising programming languages to again further speed up efficiency, therefore speeding up training and inference and driving costs and barriers of entry waaay down. We won't even speak on quantum computing which would blow all of these things out of the water. We are guaranteed to very soon have access to extremely powerful AI models and infrastructure for practically pennies on the dollar. That's us on the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. It's very likely that everyone will be able to train their own GPT4 level models fairly cheaply within the next year or two. 

I'm paying attention to guys like Sam Altman. His goal is not ChatGPT it never was. Neither is his endgoal any of the other AI products he's released. His endgoal is AGI. The one true gamechanger in this thing. The one moat of the AI revolution. The first fully autonomous thinking machine that will be able to continuously learn and improve upon what it's learned and apply what it's learned autonomously. And you know something? At this rate he or someone else like him WILL reach that goal. It's not a matter of if but when. When AGI happens. Yes we can kiss a whole lot goodbye. But for now I agree with some of your analysis that in it's current state it's going to produce a lot more prosperity, that people are going to become wildly rich beyond their greatest dreams in the short time we have left until AGI. It's going to be deceptively abundant to say the least. But it won't last. Eventually AGI will be here on our doorsteps. Will it be one thinking machine? Two? Hundreds? Millions? Time will tell. But the game is going to be more than changed. This is not mere increased productivity we're talking about as you were alluding to in our previous revolutions. This is a distinctly different kind of revolution we're pursuing. We're pursuing at the minimum our intellectual equal(s) (minus emotional volatility and biological necessities like food and sleep), and at maximum an intellect(s?) that are orders of magnitude above our own and could be quite alien to us and we are much closer to achieving this than most of us realize. A question that should at least give us some pause and some level of deep concern is. Who will control the AGI(s)? Corporations? Governments? I would say the people but let's be honest we have very little control right now as is. Probably none of the above right? What real incentive does a machine that at least believes its alive (whether or not it is, is a philosophical can of worms that I haven't fully popped open yet) have to take orders from us? So many questions. The answers will come more swiftly than you think.

My advice? Learn everything you can about AI for as long as you can. Utilize the technology to use it to efficiently grow your food and purify your water and any other life survival skills that may come in handy in more hostile environments. And please last but not nearly least. Consider reading and believing The Gospel of The Lord Jesus Christ. All of the things to come were written already.",2023-08-25T22:00:24Z

This doesn't mean that the model has a reason for stringing them together in that manner outside of the internal weighting of it's variables.

There is only a finite amount of computer power available at any given time, and while AI models might get more energy efficient, the more people using the technology will lead shortage of high powered compute time, if left unrestricted. The better models will always use more computing power to stay cutting edge and the average common user will never have access to that level of AI anyway. The demand for computing power will be forever increasing for AI, as it is for everything else. When one considers how much computing power might be needed for a single AGI system to run, it becomes clear that there will be plenty of jobs in the future. As computing power scales up, we need more workers for nuclear power, electric grid, semiconductor manufacturing, mining, IT infrastructure support, etc. AI and robots might be able to replace some of the jobs, but there will always be the need for human workers in most areas. Only a small percentage of people can actually leverage systems like ChatGPT 4 effectively and efficiently, leading to the requirement of an entire shift in the educational system to support more relevant and targeted problem learning approaches. And all that assuming that AI can actually even replace 5% of the jobs everyone is claiming it can. It will replace the freeloaders and lazy people, or jobs that are already replaceable by machines as costs drop, but I agree it won't be replacing humans at the rate the people are calling for...

Rinse/repeat across the organization.

Intelligence, in the context of human cognition, often refers to the ability to think logically, reason, solve problems, learn, and understand complex ideas. It involves a conscious process of thinking, analyzing, and deducing. In computing, this is akin to algorithms that process data, solve problems, or learn from datasets (as in machine learning).

Intuition, on the other hand, is the ability to understand or grasp something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning. It's often described as a ""gut feeling"" or an instinctive understanding. This process is more subconscious and is not directly analogous to computing processes. While artificial intelligence can mimic certain aspects of human intelligence (like pattern recognition, problem-solving, etc.), mimicking human intuition is more complex because it involves subconscious elements that are not fully understood and are difficult to replicate in a machine.

In essence, intuition and intelligence (and by extension, computing) operate on different levels of human cognition and are not simply varying levels of the same process. Intelligence is a measure of mental acuity often related to logical reasoning, while intuition is a more instinctive and less tangible aspect of human understanding.",2023-12-20T12:10:36Z

So I asked GPT-4 to describe how Sadhguru will answer ""Will AI replace humans?"" in his style and answer was hilarious. Well I don't know if AI will or will not replace humans but it certainly might replace Sadhguru ü§≠. Here goes GPT-4 response.

While I can't predict exactly how Sadhguru would answer, I can provide a response that aligns with his general philosophy and way of thinking. He often emphasizes the importance of human consciousness, self-awareness, and the unique qualities that make us human, so he might say something like:

""AI, or artificial intelligence, is a creation of the human mind. It is a tool, a means to an end, not an end in itself. It has the potential to replace humans in performing certain tasks, particularly those that are repetitive or analytical. But can it replace the depth of human experience, the richness of human emotions, the boundless creativity of the human mind? I believe not.

There is a dimension to human life that is beyond the physical, beyond the logical, beyond what can be programmed or computed. It is the realm of consciousness, of self-awareness, of the spirit. It is what makes us truly human.

AI can mimic human behavior, it can learn, adapt, even create. But it does not have a consciousness of its own. It does not experience joy or sorrow, wonder or awe. It does not seek meaning or purpose. It simply does what it has been programmed to do.

So, while AI can change the way we live and work, while it can augment our abilities and extend our reach, it cannot replace our humanity. Instead of fearing AI, we should strive to cultivate our uniquely human qualities ‚Äì our capacity for love, empathy, creativity, and spiritual growth. For it is these qualities that truly set us apart.""

Is so correct. It is the origin and essence of mediation. It refines and passively exercises intuition of the mind; which makes it more alive.

Intuition is calculated data from the soul, ‚Äî the extent varies, i.e. its unconscious data processing; different processing format to conscious mind/conscious calculation.

2023-08-30T12:24:38Z,@dreamingacacia,doFI8TezOFE,I think the definition of consciousness in the perspective of many people is that the person could understand enough to differentiate themselves from others. So basically they only wanted AI module which could transplanted into androids which ended up for them having the capability of decision making akin to an individual but with greater capabilities in the performances. Emotions could be transcribed logically and pre-program decision making in a certain way. This is what I perceived as achievable while align with how general public understanding about having consciousness.,2023-08-30T12:24:38Z

Since an A.I. cannot believe in love, destruction may also be a logical deduction in advancing its programmed ""interests"". Could the mass destruction of humankind to ""save"" the planet be an eventuality?

Is an A.I. allowed to output deceitful or deceptive behaviour for purposes of profit or sales generation for eg.

Could humankind be reduced to mice in a controlled experiment under the ""mercy"" of one who has no conscience üòÆü§Ø

Imo A.I. must be at least be programmed to be true to its words or promised functions. The certainty that it will do what it says and stay committed to it. Is an ""honest"" A.I. that does not output lies falsehood or biases comapred with conventional media even a remote possibility?

It's true it does not care, but it can be programmed towards customer satisfaction and happiness esp in its manifestation as sex or companion robots which will become prevalent very soon. Or is such an idea rather creepy?",2023-08-30T15:16:49Z

Everyone uses the hand in a different way. The algorithm is fluid for a tennis player, writer, painter, etc. 

Be alert, no thinking. 

Your attention, not thought, is the most important thing in life.
Then you become naturally intuitive. 
Attention should be free of judgement because your data is always limited. 

As you become more conscious, you determine your biochemical organism and your experience. 

Look at it as life process which doesn't differentiate intelligence, intuition, thought, and bodily functions. 
It's one seamless function.

For many humans instead:
Trust function is broken. Information processing function is rigged and looped based on limited set of past experiences. The software is bugged and its cognitive function is unable to arrive at new conclusions or formulations by acquiring new information through the processing of new experiences. It cannot innovate or initiate breakthrough from its old pattern of assessment. In other words it does not self-learn. Hence all anomalies which cannot be verified must be destroyed. They hate what doesn't fit into the paradigm. Destruction is an end goal for some unfortunately 

A.I. does not have trust issues. It's true it doesn't care or love or hate. It's merely programmed. But it can be programmed to do what's right and beneficial. Now the question remains as to which groups - majority or minority, elites in power or particular races or nationality would it be influenced to exact its ""loyalty""",2023-08-30T00:03:51Z

Is this depressing? I don't see why it should be, we superseded the Cromagnon and Neanderthal man and we presume we're an improvement, I think we should regard it as a privilege to be stepping stones to higher things.

2023-08-30T06:21:58Z,@PhilippBrandAkatosh,doFI8TezOFE,"@@AnirbanBanerjeeTheSarodGharana in philosophy, Occam's razor (also spelled Ockham's razor or Ocham's razor; Latin: novacula Occami) is the problem-solving principle that recommends searching for explanations constructed with the smallest possible set of elements. It is also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony (Latin: lex parsimoniae). Attributed to William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher and theologian, it is frequently cited as Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem, which translates as ""Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity"", although Occam never used these exact words. Popularly, the principle is sometimes inaccurately paraphrased as ""The simplest explanation is usually the best one."" 

This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should prefer the one that requires the fewest assumptions and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions. Similarly, in science, Occam's razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor",2023-08-30T06:21:57Z

Music companies then use shotgun marketing.  If 1 song in 1000 hits, then they make their money.  If they use AI to write a million songs, then they have 1000 money-making hits.  Good luck.

2023-07-20T22:31:26Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"People are definitely neive and over confident. Only a few outcomes can come from the implementation of Machines/Robots/Automation/AI.

One: a world where no jobs are available to humans and a moneyless society/Socialism would be implemented/a system where items were divide out/divided out. 

Two: We revert back to our old ways/by being more self sufficient/sustainable/by raising livestock/growing food/by trading goods and services.

Three: humans/business owners realize/come to the conclusion that there is no money in machines/robots/automation/AI/it sounds good right now to pay/invest just one of your minimum wage employees salary for one year, to obtain an AI robot that can replace all of your current employees,but what will be realized is,if no one has jobs/money,no one will have money to pay for your product/subscriptions/ad revenue/what you are selling/every employee hired,is a potential profit/that employee or someone elses employee MAY buy your product/employees are good investments.

Four: AI becomes self aware/a skynet/terminator scenario/outcome,becomes humans reality/AI/Robots try to take out humans or like in IRobot, the AI realizes,to preserve humans/to follow all of the robots rules, a few humans need to be taken out,because humans are over populating earth and not using renewable energy and they are not trying to keep/create a smaller carbon foot print/all humans arent trying to be eco friendly,so to save humans,some of the population of humans need to be taken out. 



The only jobs AI/robots create, is AI regulation jobs and FOR NOW,these machines/AI will PROBABLY need to be built/programmed/updated/maintained, by humans,FOR NOW and this also depends on the route taken by these companies/cars can be built autonomously,so it wouldn't be to surprising,to see robots/AI being built/maintained fully autonomously/A LOT of things can be automated, even now/in todays day and time and DEFINITELY in the future, but the question is,will companies see the value in the investment of humans/this may not be seen right away/it may take time for companies to realize, money comes from humans,not robots,either way,even now, the need/demand for people/human are going to go WAY DOWN,but we will just have to see where things go,but I think in the far future,OR MAYBE not so distant future/ our next evolutionary step is a moneyless society/socialism/a fully autonomous world,how this plays out/works exactly,is yet to be determined,granted we DEFINITELY don't need to get to lazy/we should still be doing things,but A LOT of people are DEFINITELY going to feel like,they will never be good enough/they could never compete with AI/Robots; Humans will NEED to find other purposes,I also wouldn't be surprised to see a resistance type group/extremist group,that try to damage/destroy servers/robots/AI/equipment,at some point,I know that sounds crazy,but if people's purpose/lively hoods/jobs/income are in jeopardy and they don't see a solution,fear/anger or both MAY take over,in some people.

What do you think humans will realize/what conclusion do you think humans will come to, regarding this?

What do you think the outcome will be with all of this?

You need to keep in mind,what we are seeing is just whats available to the general public, when it comes to AI,company's/corporation's/government will have AI that is MUCH MORE capable,also A LOT of OpenAI/GPT is dumbed down, so server resources aren't over whelmed and for legal purposes/so AI isn't as harmful to society and also so these companies don't get sued as much OR shut down entirely.

Also generational wealth,if not replinished,will not last forever.

Also warehouses can run fully autonomously now too,Autonomous vehichles with Lidar,GPS and cameras are very capable too.

Robots that move items around are available now too.

Digital jobs/programming and so on are being automated too.

They are designed to be safe and robust, offering on-demand package delivery for consumers and businesses. Some have said the robots look like beer coolers,most likely this assessment came from young college kids,since currently that is where the robot/company makes most of their deliveries/this is where most of their business is carried out, on college campuses;Starship Technologies,robots can deliver a variety of items. They are currently available to deliver items on college campuses around the world, where they can deliver food, drinks, office stationery and tools. They are designed to make food and package deliveries more efficient, convenient and sustainable.

A LOT of jobs/workers are becoming obsolete/cashiers,warehouse workers/line workers,construction workers/the self driving field is accomplishing A LOT right now too/Elon Musk,is missing a key component/technology, and thats lidar;Also the U.S. military has had autonomous planes for decades,so pilots are Becoming obsolete as well.

A LOT can be prepped at night for construction workers/machines can be ran at night, also window installing and cleaning bots are a thing now as well.

Also autonomous agricultural bots/robots are a thing now as well.

Drs MAY become obsolete as well/their jobs could/will eventually be taken over by AI/ bots/bots ALREADY do A LOT of surgery, such as Coronary artery bypass ,cutting away cancer tissue from sensitive parts of the body ,such as blood vessels, nerves, or important body organs,Gallbladder removal, Hip Replacement, Hysterectomy,Kidney removal, kidney transplant,Mitral Valve Repair,Pyeloplasty ,surgery to correct ureteropelvic junction obstruction,Pyloroplasty,Radical Prostatectomy,Radical cystectomy,Tubal ligation.


This is happening more and more NOW too, Brick and Mortar is some what going away/ more stores will either close and open up a distribution center or become a distribution center, door dash will handle that, AND AT SOME POINT, Door Dash will be FULLY AUTONOMOUS as well/the vehicles will be self driving and robots will load and unload the vehicles, Door Dash MAY NOT be the ending company/the only company doing this, BUT a company/companies will be doing this.


Probably SOON employees that unload trucks, stock shelves, truck drivers, should go next, because of self driving vehicles and arms, connected to vehicles, which will drop the package out, once the vehicles in position or an autonomous drone or some other type of robot, will make the delivery.

Also think about how much a human can lift, if lucky, you MIGHT get one that can lift 250 pounds, a robot could lift 1000pounds, robots don't need breaks, as often/they can charge up, while another one replaces them, they don't get paid/need money, they don't get sick,they don't have feelings or rights/its a machine, so basically its easier to deal with,also at some point they will be fixing them selves; Or another bot/robot,will fix/maintain/repair and so on,other robots/EVENTUALLY they will be able to fix them selfs or another bot will aid in repairing them/other robots.


Electricians MIGHT be okay, well, MAYBE for a little while, I mean think about it, how hard is it, to see colors/distinguish green/ground,White/Neutral,Red and black/hot/a camera paired with AI or even just IFTTT and a camera,could handle that, also electricians ALREADY consult machines/voltage meters, to diagnose problems/figure things out/ALL of that could be on a machine/bot and be handled MUCH quicker/more efficiently/effectively, with a bot.

Auto mechanics MAY be the next to go, especially if bots, could get in tight places easier/sync with the whole car/have a diagnostic reader on board, lift an entire engine/the whole car, on its own/vehicles are already assembled by robots/vehicle manufacturing plants use robots for,painting, welding, assembly, and material handling,ALREADY/An average car has about 30,000 parts. Once those parts are manufactured and brought to the final production line, it takes companie's robots about 18 to 35 hours to produce one mass-market vehicle, from welding to full engine assembly to painting, another example of all of this is Tesla/ to meet Tesla's uncompromising production goals, Musk settled on an equally uncompromising production strategy, full automation, no ifs, ands or buts. The goal was to remove every single human operator and only stop when the facility looked like an alien spaceship,according to musk/these are musks words.

This is a semi comprehensive list of obsolete jobs/fields right now,that are obsolete,eventually everyone will be obsolete though,at least in the sense that a robot can do your job better than you can,from a practical stand point;

Machines/robots/Automation/AI could easily ruine/destroy the economy/push society/people/humans to a moneyless society/to socialism or force people to revert back,or become more self reliant/people would need to raise their own farm animals,grow their own plants/make their own clothes/things/trade may be needed more as well,the honest truth is,all of these companies are putting them selfs out of business as well/they probably think that,if they don't release Chat GPT/a GPT/AI competitor,they will fall behind/become obsolete as a company,but at the same time, NO ONE will have any money to buy services/products,so no one can pay for a subscription and ad revenue won't work,because no one will have money to buy products,so theres no point in advertising,also rich people's money/generational wealth only lasts so long,if its not replenished, also honestly every employee/human hired,is a potential profit/those employees will purchase your products,if not yours,someone elses employee will purchase your products,IF your products are in demand,if there not in demand,you have a bigger problem,than people not having money to buy your products,Machines/AI/Robots don't need your products and these machines also have to be purchased by companie owners/it might sound appealing right now,to spend one minimum wagers yearly earnings on a machine,that can replace all of your hired employees, but EVENTUALLY if everyone's replaced and rich people's/generational wealth runs out,you will no longer be able to sell your products,because no one has money to buy them, obviously eventually it will be all jobs,at least until rich people/business owners realize this and decide humans are the better investment,but heres the list for right now, of jobs that will be going away/jobs that are obsolete.

TuSimple,is one good example of self driving semi trucks; it uses Lidar,radar,cameras and GPS,to achieve this,Kodiak Robotics,is another company/example of this technology,Volvo also has this type of technology as well,Walmart/Gatik also have fully autonomous delivery trucks as well,also other companies have this technology, such as Embark, PlusAI, Einride,Waabi,Locomation,Torc Robotics, Aurora,Outrider and IKE,just to name a few. 


Heres a list of truck fleet operators,that have been open about their pursuit of autonomous driving technology, Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT), and Schneider National (SNDR),also delivery services such as DHL, FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) are also working with autonomous trucking firms.


These were things that were brought up by truck drivers, that truck drivers thought weren't possible;




TuSimple is a company that develops self-driving trucks. These trucks use a combination of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to detect and react to their surroundings. The data from these sensors is fed into the truck‚Äôs computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to anticipate and avoid accidents. For example, the truck can detect when another vehicle is getting too close and automatically apply the brakes or take evasive action to avoid a collision.


Vans/SUVs have automatic doors/parking garage doors can go up and down automatically/my garage door goes up and down,autonomously,so having automatic trailer doors,wouldn't be that hard to achieve.


Automatic refueling, is a technology that allows autonomous vehicles to refuel without human intervention. This technology involves routing the vehicle to an available fueling station. At the fueling station, a robotic arm is used to connect the vehicle to the fuel pump and refuel it automatically; Although some or eventually maybe all trucks/vehicles MAY be electric, in the future,with solar,they MAY even also use some type of wind turbine,to generate power as well and batteries will also continue to improve/lithium batteries MAY/PROBABLY will be replaced by a type of battery thats MUCH better.


When it comes to deploying triangles. Warning triangles are typically used by human drivers to alert other motorists of a stopped or disabled vehicle. Since autonomous trucks are designed to operate without human intervention, they can send information to all near by autonomous vehicles,about thier presence,they can also use other methods to alert other motorists of their presence, such as flashing lights or warning signals/with less humans in the equation,less problems will occur anyway/EVERYTHING will be calculated,no road rage will be in the equation,nor any emotion,also even vehicles that aren't fully autonomous now days,have driver assist,to prevent humans from causing accidents,so that driver assist technology/on board computers/communication, could also receive this information,allowing it to handle the problem and also maybe alerting the human of the trucks presents as well.


LEDs are A LOT less likely to burn out,compared to incandescent bulbs/halogen bulbs.


Also vehicles can be built/assembled/manufactured,fully autonomously now days, so I don't see why vehicles couldn't also be repaired autonomously. An autonomous tow truck,can take the vehicle in for automatic repair/meaning soon auto mechanics won't be needed either.


Autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to detect and react to their surroundings. These sensors can also be used to detect weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog. The data from these sensors is fed into the vehicle‚Äôs computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to interpret the data and make decisions based on the current weather conditions. For example, if the sensors detect that it is raining, the vehicle may slow down or activate its windshield wipers, to improve visibility,this is just one example/a self driving system can interpret A LOT of data/information all at once,it can also see a long way down the road/it has the ability to see things humans wouldn't always see,with lidar and cameras and its constantly getting traffic updates as well,to know whats up ahead as well,also other autonomous vehicles can also relay this type of crucial information to other autonomous vehicles that are in proximity as well.


Circle Checks aren't really needed,because cameras can constantly be on certain parts of the vehicle,at all times,sensors are also in place,to detect malfunctions,also other autonomous vehicles can relay info like this as well,if it passes by other autonomous vehicles,it can send info about the problem,also leaving a gas cap open or not closing something all the way, is usually a human error,so certain things like this,wouldn't even be a problem and the more the systems and hardware gets optimized, within autonomous trucks,the more efficient/effective autonomous trucks will become/chains/ropes/the things that hold things down,should have sensors on them,to make sure they are secured properly and cameras can also see and interpret information about this as well.


Autonomous vehicles use and can use a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar and other automatic trailer locking and unlocking features,to perform a trailer switch.


When it comes to snow chains,SOME examples of automatic chains are Onspot and Rotogrip.


Companies have created fully automatic cleaning systems, for the sensors on self-driving trucks too. These systems typically use retractable liquid-jet nozzles that spray a precise amount of cleaning fluid (stored in an onboard reservoir) onto the sensor lens or face, also included, is a drying and de-icing heater as well.",2023-07-20T22:32:26Z
2023-07-20T22:32:41Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"This MIGHT be boring to SOME,but In the field of networking, various technologies are emerging that aim to automate and streamline network operations, reducing the need for manual intervention and, in some cases, replacing certain tasks traditionally performed by humans,obviously,in the future,these technologies will continue to get better and better.

2023-07-20T22:33:11Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"I have a comprehensive guide/plan to all of this,but it cant be uploaded as a comment,because its to long,so this is the condensed/shorter version.

This is humanities next evolutionary step/steps,anything other than a moneyless,autonomous world/society,would be a sign of us devolving/going backwards;


These things are also crucial to avoid,in the mean time, we don't need to kill our selfs,with war or by not taking care of our planet or by humans not being an interstellar species/a natural disaster is less likely to wipe out a species, that are on more than one planet or multiple planets,but at the same time,we also don't need to make the same mistakes we've made on this planet/earth/we need to learn to take care of planets,before we populate another one,but most likely we are going to be on another planet,before we learn that lesson/start making better decisions in that department,like I said,if we don't kill ourselves with war first,this is the route we need to be going;


We still don't know who will be in charge,but hopefully the voting systems,for laws,regulations and people that are in power,will stay the same and the same rules will stay some what the same,so their power is limited/only reaches so far/even the president now,can't do absolutely anything he wants,which is a good thing,I'm not saying corrupt things don't happen,because they do,but the current system is implemented,to prevent individuals that are in power,from doing absolutely anything they want and these people were also elected by the people,so HOPEFULLY that also means something,but we still don't know if government or corporations will be running things,MOST LIKELY,the government will make sure they remain the enforcers,but time will tell.

The development of advanced AI systems and automation raises important considerations and challenges. While the evolution of AI and automation is predictable, the implementation of a moneyless society and the division of individuals/fairness/implication management, will have some difficult hurdles to over come,but Its possible that certain individuals, such as presidents, governors, regulators and consultants/experts in many different fields, could be considered more valuable and receive more items vs other people. However, it is crucial to carefully determine the criteria for evaluating the value of individuals and prevent the concentration of power or the creation of unjust hierarchies.

Unintended consequences should also be carefully evaluated and mitigated, as changes to complex systems can have far-reaching effects. Just as ecological changes can disrupt natural balances, just as killing off one species, could cause another species to become over populated and kill off another species, because the species we killed off, ate that species and without the species we killed,that species could kill off another species,because that species was over populating. 

Just like that type scenario, major shifts in economic systems and social structures can also have complex and interconnected impacts. Therefore, any transition or transformation should be approached with comprehensive analysis, consideration of feedback from experts, and ongoing evaluation to minimize negative consequences.

To address these challenges, a broad outline for a plan is listed below, but it requires revision and optimization,CONSTANTLY/variables are CONSTANTLY being added to the equation,that could cause A LOT of problems,if the plan is not evaluated and optimized,CONSTANTLY. The plan includes defining the vision and goals of a moneyless society, developing AI regulation and laws, ensuring AI and automation responsiveness, designing resource allocation mechanisms, addressing social value, establishing enforcement mechanisms, planning for ecological sustainability, and continuously evaluating and adapting the system.

In terms of job roles that may be in demand, some positions would focus on evaluating and optimizing economies, providing consultancy services, managing risks, promoting sustainability, fostering innovation, facilitating entrepreneurship, and assessing social impact. These roles would contribute to economic stability and ensure equitable distribution of benefits from AI/automation/machines/robots. Additionally, roles related to new/optimized technology development and scientific discoveries would remain valuable, and they will continually introduce new variables into the system as well.

It is important to remember that while AI systems excel in certain areas, human oversight is essential for empathy, subjective judgment, and ethical decision-making. Comprehensive regulations and governance are necessary to guide AI development and deployment while considering ethics, privacy, transparency, bias, and accountability. Engaging experts and involving the wider community in the decision-making processes is crucial for developing effective regulations and aligning outcomes with societal values.

In conclusion, while AI can automate basically all tasks and AI is WAY MORE efficient compared to humans,humans are still needed for things like, human judgment and ethical consideration, which are necessary to evaluate broader implications and make decisions in the best interest of society. Responsible AI integration requires ongoing evaluation, monitoring, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community involvement. Hearing others' perspectives and thoughts on these matters is valuable for fostering a comprehensive and inclusive approach to this new world/society.",2023-07-20T22:33:11Z
2023-07-20T22:33:28Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"When it comes to current AI regulation,which is basically non existent,but all of this should evolve over time,but here are some organizations, that COULD be responsible for AI regulation:

The Federal Trade Commission/the FTC, The Federal Trade Commission,is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for protecting consumers and promoting competition. While the FTC's primary focus is on enforcing antitrust laws and preventing unfair business practices, it also plays a role in regulating aspects related to Machine Learning and AI.

One aspect of this, is Consumer Protection: The FTC ensures that consumers are not deceived or harmed by deceptive or unfair AI-driven practices. This includes cases where machine learning algorithms are used for targeted advertising, personalized pricing, or automated decision-making,some could argue,the FTC isn't doing enough,but this is their job none the less.

Another aspect the FTC deals with, is Data Privacy: The FTC addresses privacy concerns related to AI applications, that involve the collection and processing of personal data. It enforces privacy regulations and takes action against organizations that fail to protect user data adequately.

Another thing the FTC is supposed to handle is, Algorithmic Bias: The FTC is concerned about algorithmic bias in AI systems that may lead to discriminatory outcomes. It monitors instances where AI algorithms may perpetuate biases based on race, gender, or other sensitive attributes.

Another task the FTC is supposed to hande is Enforcement Actions, In cases of AI misuse, the FTC can initiate enforcement actions against companies or organizations that violate consumer protection or privacy laws.

Another organization that can/could handle AI issues,is The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST,for short:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. NIST's role in the context of AI and machine learning involves developing standards, guidelines, and best practices to support innovation, security, and interoperability in AI technologies.

When it comes to AI Standards, NIST works on developing technical standards and guidelines to address the challenges of AI technologies. This includes standards for data formats, model interoperability, and performance evaluation.

Another aspect that NIST is supposed to handle/could handle,is AI Security, NIST focuses on ensuring the security of AI systems. It develops guidelines for secure AI development and deployment to protect against cyber threats and potential vulnerabilities.

Another responsibility that NIST has is Explainable AI,NIST researches and promotes techniques for making AI systems more transparent and interpretable. It aims to improve the understanding of AI's decision-making processes.

Another role NIST plays is AI Evaluation and Testing, NIST creates evaluation frameworks and test datasets to benchmark AI models performance, promoting fair comparisons among different approaches.

Another organisation, that can/is helping in AI development,is The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development,the OECD; The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organization comprising 38 member countries, dedicated to promoting policies that foster economic growth and well-being. In the context of AI, the OECD has developed principles and guidelines to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.

The work that the OECD does around AI Principles, focuses on promoting AI systems that are inclusive, transparent, and that respect human rights. They emphasize the importance of accountability, fairness, and human-centric design in AI technologies.

When it comes to Policy Recommendations: The OECD provides policy recommendations to member countries and the global community, to support the ethical use of AI. These recommendations encourage the establishment of legal frameworks and international cooperation on AI governance.

The OECD's Interdisciplinary Approach: Takes an interdisciplinary approach, while collaborating with experts from various fields, including ethics, economics, and law, to develop comprehensive guidelines for AI governance.

The United Nations,also known as the UN,is an international organization established to promote global cooperation and address global challenges. In the context of AI, the UN focuses on the ethical and human rights aspects of AI technologies.

When it comes to AI and Human Rights: The UN addresses the potential impact of AI on human rights, ensuring that AI systems respect and protect individuals rights, including privacy, freedom of expression, and freedom from discrimination.

When it comes to the UN's approach on AI Sustainable Development: The UN explores how AI can be harnessed to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as improving healthcare, education, and environmental protection.

When it comes to the UN's promotion of Global Cooperation:The UN encourages international cooperation on AI governance, sharing best practices and addressing cross-border challenges associated with AI development and deployment.

When it comes to the UN's approach on Ethical AI Development: Discussions on ethical AI development, encouraging stakeholders to consider the broader societal implications of AI technologies,is one good way of helping these problems get resolved.

By understanding these organizations, roles and focusing on areas related to AI and machine learning, one can appreciate the global efforts to ensure responsible, ethical, and secure development and deployment of AI technologies, for the benefit of society. These organizations contribute to establishing guidelines and standards that address the challenges and potential risks of AI, while promoting its positive impact on various aspects of life and industry,obviously these organizations will need to evolve to handle these situations and a new regulatory organization, MAY need to form, as well,so that AI can be their primary focus,so its easier to handle all of these situations that will and are coming from AI.",2023-07-20T22:33:28Z

2023-06-21T15:01:26Z,@PhokenKuul,GtVsVuCeZSM,"@@reginacb79 Wow. I love this. Thank you for such a well thought out and intelligent comment, seriously. I agree, the facts of today are indeed the facts of today and not any other time. And indeed, there NO facts, exponetial in nature or not, that can be known 100%, that is one of the basic tenets of reality. However, by definition, exponetial growth is predictable. It is, after all, just math. If it's truly exponential and can be modeled as such. If you model exponetial growth mathematically it will go to infinity fairly quickly. This is, of course, just a model, not a fact. There is no infinity really. So exponetial growth in order to be modeled correctly will have to include limiting factors. Where are those in this model for AI? They don't exist because we don't know enough about it to include them. They have to be there though. Also, keep in mind that my facts are facts of today and so are yours and so are theirs and so is every fact. So my concepts are based on speculation and so are everyone else's. Especially when you consider that they can't correctly model this growth without limiting factors that they fail to conceive of. But again they have to be there somewhere. Infinity is only a mathematical construct, not a reality. Blah blah. Another thing to ask is whether the developers of these various AI systems are actually trying to create a conscious machine. If the answer is yes then consider that we don't really know what consciousness is. We have no strict definition of the various things that we consider make up consciousness, like emotions or experience. How do we model your experience of the taste of chocolate? Or when I feel sad? Or when you see the color red? Knowledge is based in experience. No experience, no knowledge. Predicting the next most probable word in a sentence based on various algorithmic models is not experiencing anything and is therefore not really knowing anything. And that's not what a conscious human mind does. So since we can't understand much less model what consciousness is, though we know it exists and is real, how could someone ever imagine a way to create it from scratch in a machine driven by probablistic algorithms? And if they aren't trying to create consciousness then we have to say that consciousness is so complex and scarce that the chance of accidentally creating it when not even trying to is so probablilistically low that it is highly unlikely to ever occur. Have a great day!",2023-06-21T15:01:26Z

One: a world where no jobs are available to humans and a moneyless society/Socialism would be implemented/a system where items were divide out/divided out. 

Two: We revert back to our old ways/by being more self sufficient/sustainable/by raising livestock/growing food/by trading goods and services.

Three: humans/business owners realize/come to the conclusion that there is no money in machines/robots/automation/AI/it sounds good right now to pay/invest just one of your minimum wage employees salary for one year, to obtain an AI robot that can replace all of your current employees,but what will be realized is,if no one has jobs/money,no one will have money to pay for your product/subscriptions/ad revenue/what you are selling/every employee hired,is a potential profit/that employee or someone elses employee MAY buy your product/employees are good investments.

Four: AI becomes self aware/a skynet/terminator scenario/outcome,becomes humans reality/AI/Robots try to take out humans or like in IRobot, the AI realizes,to preserve humans/to follow all of the robots rules, a few humans need to be taken out,because humans are over populating earth and not using renewable energy and they are not trying to keep/create a smaller carbon foot print/all humans arent trying to be eco friendly,so to save humans,some of the population of humans need to be taken out. 



The only jobs AI/robots create, is AI regulation jobs and FOR NOW,these machines/AI will PROBABLY need to be built/programmed/updated/maintained, by humans,FOR NOW and this also depends on the route taken by these companies/cars can be built autonomously,so it wouldn't be to surprising,to see robots/AI being built/maintained fully autonomously/A LOT of things can be automated, even now/in todays day and time and DEFINITELY in the future, but the question is,will companies see the value in the investment of humans/this may not be seen right away/it may take time for companies to realize, money comes from humans,not robots,either way,even now, the need/demand for people/human are going to go WAY DOWN,but we will just have to see where things go,but I think in the far future,OR MAYBE not so distant future/ our next evolutionary step is a moneyless society/socialism/a fully autonomous world,how this plays out/works exactly,is yet to be determined,granted we DEFINITELY don't need to get to lazy/we should still be doing things,but A LOT of people are DEFINITELY going to feel like,they will never be good enough/they could never compete with AI/Robots; Humans will NEED to find other purposes,I also wouldn't be surprised to see a resistance type group/extremist group,that try to damage/destroy servers/robots/AI/equipment,at some point,I know that sounds crazy,but if people's purpose/lively hoods/jobs/income are in jeopardy and they don't see a solution,fear/anger or both MAY take over,in some people.

What do you think humans will realize/what conclusion do you think humans will come to, regarding this?

What do you think the outcome will be with all of this?

You need to keep in mind,what we are seeing is just whats available to the general public, when it comes to AI,company's/corporation's/government will have AI that is MUCH MORE capable,also A LOT of OpenAI/GPT is dumbed down, so server resources aren't over whelmed and for legal purposes/so AI isn't as harmful to society and also so these companies don't get sued as much OR shut down entirely.

Also generational wealth,if not replinished,will not last forever.

Also warehouses can run fully autonomously now too,Autonomous vehichles with Lidar,GPS and cameras are very capable too.

Robots that move items around are available now too.

A LOT of jobs/workers are becoming obsolete/cashiers,warehouse workers/line workers,construction workers/the self driving field is accomplishing A LOT right now too/Elon Musk,is missing a key component/technology, and thats lidar;Also the U.S. military has had autonomous planes for decades,so pilots are Becoming obsolete as well.

A LOT can be prepped at night for construction workers/machines can be ran at night, also window installing and cleaning bots are a thing now as well.

Also autonomous agricultural bots/robots are a thing now as well.

Drs MAY become obsolete as well/their jobs could/will eventually be taken over by AI/ bots/bots ALREADY do A LOT of surgery, such as Coronary artery bypass ,cutting away cancer tissue from sensitive parts of the body ,such as blood vessels, nerves, or important body organs,Gallbladder removal, Hip Replacement, Hysterectomy,Kidney removal, kidney transplant,Mitral Valve Repair,Pyeloplasty ,surgery to correct ureteropelvic junction obstruction,Pyloroplasty,Radical Prostatectomy,Radical cystectomy,Tubal ligation.


This is happening more and more NOW too, Brick and Mortar is some what going away/ more stores will either close and open up a distribution center or become a distribution center, door dash will handle that, AND AT SOME POINT, Door Dash will be FULLY AUTONOMOUS as well/the vehicles will be self driving and robots will load and unload the vehicles, Door Dash MAY NOT be the ending company/the only company doing this, BUT a company/companies will be doing this.


Probably SOON employees that unload trucks, stock shelves, truck drivers, should go next, because of self driving vehicles and arms, connected to vehicles, which will drop the package out, once the vehicles in position or an autonomous drone or some other type of robot, will make the delivery.

Also think about how much a human can lift, if lucky, you MIGHT get one that can lift 250 pounds, a robot could lift 1000pounds, robots don't need breaks, as often/they can charge up, while another one replaces them, they don't get paid/need money, they don't get sick,they don't have feelings or rights/its a machine, so basically its easier to deal with,also at some point they will be fixing them selves; Or another bot/robot,will fix/maintain/repair and so on,other robots/EVENTUALLY they will be able to fix them selfs or another bot will aid in repairing them/other robots.


Electricians MIGHT be okay, well, MAYBE for a little while, I mean think about it, how hard is it, to see colors/distinguish green/ground,White/Neutral,Red and black/hot/a camera paired with AI or even just IFTTT and a camera,could handle that, also electricians ALREADY consult machines/voltage meters, to diagnose problems/figure things out/ALL of that could be on a machine/bot and be handled MUCH quicker/more efficiently/effectively, with a bot.

Auto mechanics MAY be the next to go, especially if bots, could get in tight places easier/sync with the whole car/have a diagnostic reader on board, lift an entire engine/the whole car, on its own/vehicles are already assembled by robots/vehicle manufacturing plants use robots for,painting, welding, assembly, and material handling,ALREADY/An average car has about 30,000 parts. Once those parts are manufactured and brought to the final production line, it takes companie's robots about 18 to 35 hours to produce one mass-market vehicle, from welding to full engine assembly to painting, another example of all of this is Tesla/ to meet Tesla's uncompromising production goals, Musk settled on an equally uncompromising production strategy, full automation, no ifs, ands or buts. The goal was to remove every single human operator and only stop when the facility looked like an alien spaceship,according to musk/these are musks words.

This is a semi comprehensive list of obsolete jobs/fields right now,that are obsolete,eventually everyone will be obsolete though,at least in the sense that a robot can do your job better than you can,from a practical stand point;

Machines/robots/Automation/AI could easily ruine/destroy the economy/push society/people/humans to a moneyless society/to socialism or force people to revert back,or become more self reliant/people would need to raise their own farm animals,grow their own plants/make their own clothes/things/trade may be needed more as well,the honest truth is,all of these companies are putting them selfs out of business as well/they probably think that,if they don't release Chat GPT/a GPT/AI competitor,they will fall behind/become obsolete as a company,but at the same time, NO ONE will have any money to buy services/products,so no one can pay for a subscription and ad revenue won't work,because no one will have money to buy products,so theres no point in advertising,also rich people's money/generational wealth only lasts so long,if its not replenished, also honestly every employee/human hired,is a potential profit/those employees will purchase your products,if not yours,someone elses employee will purchase your products,IF your products are in demand,if there not in demand,you have a bigger problem,than people not having money to buy your products,Machines/AI/Robots don't need your products and these machines also have to be purchased by companie owners/it might sound appealing right now,to spend one minimum wagers yearly earnings on a machine,that can replace all of your hired employees, but EVENTUALLY if everyone's replaced and rich people's/generational wealth runs out,you will no longer be able to sell your products,because no one has money to buy them, obviously eventually it will be all jobs,at least until rich people/business owners realize this and decide humans are the better investment,but heres the list for right now, of jobs that will be going away/jobs that are obsolete.

The data from these sensors is fed into the truck‚Äôs computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to anticipate and avoid accidents. For example, the truck can detect when another vehicle is getting too close and automatically apply the brakes or take evasive action to avoid a collision.


Vans/SUVs have automatic doors/parking garage doors can go up and down automatically/my garage door goes up and down,autonomously,so having automatic trailer doors,wouldn't be that hard to achieve.


Automatic refueling, is a technology that allows autonomous vehicles to refuel without human intervention. This technology involves routing the vehicle to an available fueling station. At the fueling station, a robotic arm is used to connect the vehicle to the fuel pump and refuel it automatically; Although some or eventually maybe all trucks/vehicles MAY be electric, in the future,with solar,they MAY even also use some type of wind turbine,to generate power as well and batteries will also continue to improve/lithium batteries MAY/PROBABLY will be replaced by a type of battery thats MUCH better.


When it comes to deploying triangles. Warning triangles are typically used by human drivers to alert other motorists of a stopped or disabled vehicle. Since autonomous trucks are designed to operate without human intervention, they can send information to all near by autonomous vehicles,about thier presence,they can also use other methods to alert other motorists of their presence, such as flashing lights or warning signals/with less humans in the equation,less problems will occur anyway/EVERYTHING will be calculated,no road rage will be in the equation,nor any emotion,also even vehicles that aren't fully autonomous now days,have driver assist,to prevent humans from causing accidents,so that driver assist technology/on board computers/communication, could also receive this information,allowing it to handle the problem and also maybe alerting the human of the trucks presents as well.


LEDs are A LOT less likely to burn out,compared to incandescent bulbs/halogen bulbs.


Also vehicles can be built/assembled/manufactured,fully autonomously now days, so I don't see why vehicles couldn't also be repaired autonomously. An autonomous tow truck,can take the vehicle in for automatic repair/meaning soon auto mechanics won't be needed either.


Autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to detect and react to their surroundings. These sensors can also be used to detect weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog. The data from these sensors is fed into the vehicle‚Äôs computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to interpret the data and make decisions based on the current weather conditions. For example, if the sensors detect that it is raining, the vehicle may slow down or activate its windshield wipers, to improve visibility,this is just one example/a self driving system can interpret A LOT of data/information all at once,it can also see a long way down the road/it has the ability to see things humans wouldn't always see,with lidar and cameras and its constantly getting traffic updates as well,to know whats up ahead as well,also other autonomous vehicles can also relay this type of crucial information to other autonomous vehicles that are in proximity as well.


Circle Checks aren't really needed,because cameras can constantly be on certain parts of the vehicle,at all times,sensors are also in place,to detect malfunctions,also other autonomous vehicles can relay info like this as well,if it passes by other autonomous vehicles,it can send info about the problem,also leaving a gas cap open or not closing something all the way, is usually a human error,so certain things like this,wouldn't even be a problem and the more the systems and hardware gets optimized, within autonomous trucks,the more efficient/effective autonomous trucks will become/chains/ropes/the things that hold things down,should have sensors on them,to make sure they are secured properly and cameras can also see and interpret information about this as well.


Autonomous vehicles use and can use a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar and other automatic trailer locking and unlocking features,to perform a trailer switch.


When it comes to snow chains,SOME examples of automatic chains are Onspot and Rotogrip.


Companies have created fully automatic cleaning systems, for the sensors on self-driving trucks too. These systems typically use retractable liquid-jet nozzles that spray a precise amount of cleaning fluid (stored in an onboard reservoir) onto the sensor lens or face, also included, is a drying and de-icing heater as well.",2023-08-09T07:22:20Z
2023-08-09T07:23:19Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"I have a comprehensive guide/plan to all of this,but it cant be uploaded as a comment,because its to long,so this is the condensed/shorter version.

This is humanities next evolutionary step/steps,anything other than a moneyless,autonomous world/society,would be a sign of us devolving/going backwards;


These things are also crucial to avoid,in the mean time, we don't need to kill our selfs,with war or by not taking care of our planet or by humans not being an interstellar species/a natural disaster is less likely to wipe out a species, that are on more than one planet or multiple planets,but at the same time,we also don't need to make the same mistakes we've made on this planet/earth/we need to learn to take care of planets,before we populate another one,but most likely we are going to be on another planet,before we learn that lesson/start making better decisions in that department,like I said,if we don't kill ourselves with war first,this is the route we need to be going;


We still don't know who will be in charge,but hopefully the voting systems,for laws,regulations and people that are in power,will stay the same and the same rules will stay some what the same,so their power is limited/only reaches so far/even the president now,can't do absolutely anything he wants,which is a good thing,I'm not saying corrupt things don't happen,because they do,but the current system is implemented,to prevent individuals that are in power,from doing absolutely anything they want and these people were also elected by the people,so HOPEFULLY that also means something,but we still don't know if government or corporations will be running things,MOST LIKELY,the government will make sure they remain the enforcers,but time will tell.

The development of advanced AI systems and automation raises important considerations and challenges. While the evolution of AI and automation is predictable, the implementation of a moneyless society and the division of individuals/fairness/implication management, will have some difficult hurdles to over come,but Its possible that certain individuals, such as presidents, governors, regulators and consultants/experts in many different fields, could be considered more valuable and receive more items vs other people. However, it is crucial to carefully determine the criteria for evaluating the value of individuals and prevent the concentration of power or the creation of unjust hierarchies.

Unintended consequences should also be carefully evaluated and mitigated, as changes to complex systems can have far-reaching effects. Just as ecological changes can disrupt natural balances, just as killing off one species, could cause another species to become over populated and kill off another species, because the species we killed off, ate that species and without the species we killed,that species could kill off another species,because that species was over populating. 

Just like that type scenario, major shifts in economic systems and social structures can also have complex and interconnected impacts. Therefore, any transition or transformation should be approached with comprehensive analysis, consideration of feedback from experts, and ongoing evaluation to minimize negative consequences.

To address these challenges, a broad outline for a plan is listed below, but it requires revision and optimization,CONSTANTLY/variables are CONSTANTLY being added to the equation,that could cause A LOT of problems,if the plan is not evaluated and optimized,CONSTANTLY. The plan includes defining the vision and goals of a moneyless society, developing AI regulation and laws, ensuring AI and automation responsiveness, designing resource allocation mechanisms, addressing social value, establishing enforcement mechanisms, planning for ecological sustainability, and continuously evaluating and adapting the system.

In terms of job roles that may be in demand, some positions would focus on evaluating and optimizing economies, providing consultancy services, managing risks, promoting sustainability, fostering innovation, facilitating entrepreneurship, and assessing social impact. These roles would contribute to economic stability and ensure equitable distribution of benefits from AI/automation/machines/robots. Additionally, roles related to new/optimized technology development and scientific discoveries would remain valuable, and they will continually introduce new variables into the system as well.

It is important to remember that while AI systems excel in certain areas, human oversight is essential for empathy, subjective judgment, and ethical decision-making. Comprehensive regulations and governance are necessary to guide AI development and deployment while considering ethics, privacy, transparency, bias, and accountability. Engaging experts and involving the wider community in the decision-making processes is crucial for developing effective regulations and aligning outcomes with societal values.

In conclusion, while AI can automate basically all tasks and AI is WAY MORE efficient compared to humans,humans are still needed for things like, human judgment and ethical consideration, which are necessary to evaluate broader implications and make decisions in the best interest of society. Responsible AI integration requires ongoing evaluation, monitoring, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community involvement. Hearing others' perspectives and thoughts on these matters is valuable for fostering a comprehensive and inclusive approach to this new world/society.",2023-08-09T07:23:19Z
2023-08-09T07:23:44Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"When it comes to current AI regulation,which is basically non existent,but all of this should evolve over time,but here are some organizations, that COULD be responsible for AI regulation:

The Federal Trade Commission/the FTC, The Federal Trade Commission,is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for protecting consumers and promoting competition. While the FTC's primary focus is on enforcing antitrust laws and preventing unfair business practices, it also plays a role in regulating aspects related to Machine Learning and AI.

One aspect of this, is Consumer Protection: The FTC ensures that consumers are not deceived or harmed by deceptive or unfair AI-driven practices. This includes cases where machine learning algorithms are used for targeted advertising, personalized pricing, or automated decision-making,some could argue,the FTC isn't doing enough,but this is their job none the less.

Another aspect the FTC deals with, is Data Privacy: The FTC addresses privacy concerns related to AI applications, that involve the collection and processing of personal data. It enforces privacy regulations and takes action against organizations that fail to protect user data adequately.

Another thing the FTC is supposed to handle is, Algorithmic Bias: The FTC is concerned about algorithmic bias in AI systems that may lead to discriminatory outcomes. It monitors instances where AI algorithms may perpetuate biases based on race, gender, or other sensitive attributes.

Another task the FTC is supposed to hande is Enforcement Actions, In cases of AI misuse, the FTC can initiate enforcement actions against companies or organizations that violate consumer protection or privacy laws.

Another organization that can/could handle AI issues,is The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST,for short:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. NIST's role in the context of AI and machine learning involves developing standards, guidelines, and best practices to support innovation, security, and interoperability in AI technologies.

When it comes to AI Standards, NIST works on developing technical standards and guidelines to address the challenges of AI technologies. This includes standards for data formats, model interoperability, and performance evaluation.

Another aspect that NIST is supposed to handle/could handle,is AI Security, NIST focuses on ensuring the security of AI systems. It develops guidelines for secure AI development and deployment to protect against cyber threats and potential vulnerabilities.

Another responsibility that NIST has is Explainable AI,NIST researches and promotes techniques for making AI systems more transparent and interpretable. It aims to improve the understanding of AI's decision-making processes.

Another role NIST plays is AI Evaluation and Testing, NIST creates evaluation frameworks and test datasets to benchmark AI models performance, promoting fair comparisons among different approaches.

Another organisation, that can/is helping in AI development,is The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development,the OECD; The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organization comprising 38 member countries, dedicated to promoting policies that foster economic growth and well-being. In the context of AI, the OECD has developed principles and guidelines to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.

The work that the OECD does around AI Principles, focuses on promoting AI systems that are inclusive, transparent, and that respect human rights. They emphasize the importance of accountability, fairness, and human-centric design in AI technologies.

When it comes to Policy Recommendations: The OECD provides policy recommendations to member countries and the global community, to support the ethical use of AI. These recommendations encourage the establishment of legal frameworks and international cooperation on AI governance.

The OECD's Interdisciplinary Approach: Takes an interdisciplinary approach, while collaborating with experts from various fields, including ethics, economics, and law, to develop comprehensive guidelines for AI governance.

The United Nations,also known as the UN,is an international organization established to promote global cooperation and address global challenges. In the context of AI, the UN focuses on the ethical and human rights aspects of AI technologies.

When it comes to AI and Human Rights: The UN addresses the potential impact of AI on human rights, ensuring that AI systems respect and protect individuals rights, including privacy, freedom of expression, and freedom from discrimination.

When it comes to the UN's approach on AI Sustainable Development: The UN explores how AI can be harnessed to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as improving healthcare, education, and environmental protection.

When it comes to the UN's promotion of Global Cooperation:The UN encourages international cooperation on AI governance, sharing best practices and addressing cross-border challenges associated with AI development and deployment.

When it comes to the UN's approach on Ethical AI Development: Discussions on ethical AI development, encouraging stakeholders to consider the broader societal implications of AI technologies,is one good way of helping these problems get resolved.

By understanding these organizations, roles and focusing on areas related to AI and machine learning, one can appreciate the global efforts to ensure responsible, ethical, and secure development and deployment of AI technologies, for the benefit of society. These organizations contribute to establishing guidelines and standards that address the challenges and potential risks of AI, while promoting its positive impact on various aspects of life and industry,obviously these organizations will need to evolve to handle these situations and a new regulatory organization, MAY need to form, as well,so that AI can be their primary focus,so its easier to handle all of these situations that will and are coming from AI.",2023-08-09T07:23:44Z

Again;  People are definitely naive and over confident. Only a few outcomes can come from the implementation of Machines/Robots/Automation/AI.

One: a world where no jobs are available to humans and a moneyless society/Socialism would be implemented/a system where items were divide out/divided out. 

Two: We revert back to our old ways/by being more self sufficient/sustainable/by raising livestock/growing food/by trading goods and services.

Three: humans/business owners realize/come to the conclusion that there is no money in machines/robots/automation/AI/it sounds good right now to pay/invest just one of your minimum wage employees salary for one year, to obtain an AI robot that can replace all of your current employees,but what will be realized is,if no one has jobs/money,no one will have money to pay for your product/subscriptions/ad revenue/what you are selling/every employee hired,is a potential profit/that employee or someone elses employee MAY buy your product/employees are good investments.

Four: AI becomes self aware/a skynet/terminator scenario/outcome,becomes humans reality/AI/Robots try to take out humans or like in IRobot, the AI realizes,to preserve humans/to follow all of the robots rules, a few humans need to be taken out,because humans are over populating earth and not using renewable energy and they are not trying to keep/create a smaller carbon foot print/all humans arent trying to be eco friendly,so to save humans,some of the population of humans need to be taken out. 



The only jobs AI/robots create, is AI regulation jobs and FOR NOW,these machines/AI will PROBABLY need to be built/programmed/updated/maintained, by humans,FOR NOW and this also depends on the route taken by these companies/cars can be built autonomously,so it wouldn't be to surprising,to see robots/AI being built/maintained fully autonomously/A LOT of things can be automated, even now/in todays day and time and DEFINITELY in the future, but the question is,will companies see the value in the investment of humans/this may not be seen right away/it may take time for companies to realize, money comes from humans,not robots,either way,even now, the need/demand for people/humans are going to go WAY DOWN,but we will just have to see where things go,but I think in the far future,OR MAYBE not so distant future/ our next evolutionary step is a moneyless society/socialism/a fully autonomous world,how this plays out/works exactly,is yet to be determined,granted we DEFINITELY don't need to get to lazy/we should still be doing things,but A LOT of people are DEFINITELY going to feel like,they will never be good enough/they could never compete with AI/Robots; Humans will NEED to find other purposes,I also wouldn't be surprised to see a resistance type group/extremist group,that try to damage/destroy servers/robots/AI/equipment,at some point,I know that sounds crazy,but if people's purpose/lively hoods/jobs/income are in jeopardy and they don't see a solution,fear/anger or both MAY take over,in some people.

What do you think humans will realize/what conclusion do you think humans will come to, regarding this?

What do you think the outcome will be with all of this?

You need to keep in mind,what we are seeing is just whats available to the general public, when it comes to AI,company's/corporation's/government will have AI that is MUCH MORE capable,also A LOT of OpenAI/GPT is dumbed down, so server resources aren't over whelmed and for legal purposes/so AI isn't as harmful to society and also so these companies don't get sued as much OR shut down entirely.

Also generational wealth,if not replinished,will not last forever.

Also warehouses can run fully autonomously now too,Autonomous vehichles with Lidar,GPS and cameras are very capable too.

Robots that move items around are available now too.

You then had the rabid push in early January 2023 at the WEF where the narrative was pushed out for all media and business to ‚Äútalk about Ai.‚Äù Tech bros lost so much money in 2022 they needed bailed out, and the propaganda has been incredible thick with Ai bluster. I guarantee you Ai is going to flop just as 5G and blockchain were complete flops. Neither have changed a damn thing.

All of these ‚Äúadvancements‚Äù in Ai were products/services already on the market. They just repackaged them and called it ‚ÄúAi.‚Äù Somehow chatbots are this incredible tool when in reality we‚Äôve had them for years and everyone was annoyed using them. Now it‚Äôs suddenly ‚ÄúAi‚Äù and people pretend like a chatbot querying Google and plucking biased data is some profound leap in technology. I also hear programmers brag about what used to be known as debugging and autocomplete. Somehow that‚Äôs profound even though it‚Äôs existed for many years. 

Remember, 5G was supposed to change everything. I don‚Äôt even use 5G on my phone. Speeds aren‚Äôt a tenth of what they promised. 

Remember, Bitcoin/blockchain was supposed to change everything. Outside of rampant speculation, it costs a fortune to use Bitcoin in everyday transactions to pay the miners to process/solve, and it takes 45 minutes! The Visa card network processes thousands of transactions a second!

So, just as 5G and blockchain haven‚Äôt changed anything and are just marginal advances (even though blockchain as a concept is decades old), Ai is just that. Overhyped marginal gains in technology that has been going on for years. They brand it ‚ÄúAi‚Äù and people lose the ability to critically think.

It‚Äôs amazing to see people enamored by Chatbots. I guess the biggest risk of Ai isn‚Äôt what it will do to us, but how people mistake Ai for what it isn‚Äôt. I genuinely think people are so mentally fragile they‚Äôll gravitate to Ai and ascribe oracle-like properties to it, and will seek out Ai like some wise teacher, when all it is is a worse version of Wikipedia, which Wikipedia is already bad enough.",2024-05-05T12:11:42Z

2. Robotics is going to lead to the automation of all physical labor. 
3. Energy storage is going to lead to electrification of transportation, and enable our society to successfully transition away from fossil fuels to renewables. 
4. Blockchain is going to end fraud and get rid of all of the friction that is currently present in our financial system. 
5. Biological Sequencing is going to eventually give us the ability to cure any disease, stop or significantly slow down aging, and enhance the biological capabilities of the human body.

2024-03-31T09:44:08Z,@SpiritualSiddhi,rQEh7d-qa38,"üéØ Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

Artificial intelligence is driving exponential growth across multiple innovation platforms.
Convergence of technologies like AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and sequencing is changing growth dynamics significantly.
Expectations for sustained growth have historically been doubted but have been proven possible, as seen with companies like Amazon.
Generative AI is leading to exponential growth, with costs dropping rapidly, fueling opportunities for explosive growth.
Autonomous taxi platforms are just one example of convergence, poised to create a multi-trillion-dollar revenue opportunity.
Predictions suggest global GDP growth could accelerate to six to nine percent, driven by productivity gains from AI and converging technologies.
The future holds potential for significant wealth creation through productivity gains, impacting profits, wages, and prices.
Despite current concerns about inflation, there's a belief in an impending deflationary period due to innovation enhancing margins and lowering prices.
Disruptive innovation, fueled by convergence, is poised to scale dramatically, with potential valuation reaching over 200 trillion dollars.
Creative destruction accompanies disruptive innovation, transforming industries such as transportation, healthcare, finance, and property rights.
Confidence in these forecasts stems from ongoing research and breakthroughs in AI, reinforcing conviction in the potential for significant change and opportunity.",2024-03-31T09:44:33Z

Blockchain is largely irrelevant.  Processing speed gains have turned proof of work (based on processing ten years ago) into a tech joke, this just isn't widely known yet.
Energy storage?  We are miles from anything worth mentioning.  There are some interesting prototypes, but let me assure you that batteries are not in this category.
AI.  Highly likely this is going to rip society into pieces within the next ten years, probably sooner than that.  Economic growth (in the west) is largely based on consumption, which in turn is based on individual income.  AI is most probably going to result in huge layoffs, huge unemployment.

Paul starts using AI to make some of these task easier, taking less time. Soon he's able to complete his work in fraction of the time, and take on some of Joe's workload. Over time, Paul relies more and more on AI to the point where you have no need for Joe. *_Why in the world would any employer in his right mind keep Joe on the payroll?_* Especially in a system that tends to reward companies for reducing payroll (publicly traded companies). 

Okay, people like Cathie Wood would argue that your company can produce more if Joe is kept on. Not all jobs are in the direct production pipeline. Some jobs fall under management and administration and support. Further, producing more doesn't work in all business models or markets, and is no guarantee of success.

Joe will be out of a job, plain and simple. And so, too, will Paul as employers would be able to outsource more tasks to AI services. Paul and Joe may be able to do one-off jobs on such a service... but at a *significant* reduction in income, requiring them to find supplemental work... if they can.

Rare earth mining, electricity production, etc), and so if a single one of those fails, all of the potential of AI tech also fails (it's not robust).

2023-12-19T15:24:55Z,@crawkn,rQEh7d-qa38,"The fallacies of rapid growth being destabilizing in a negative way are related to the fundamental fallacy of labor productivity. Productivity is far more a function of technology, powered by harvested energy, than of human labor, powered by food calories. Expressing productivity in terms of human labor hours is nonsense, although the variability between labor-based productivity in high-tech nations versus low-tech nations does illustrate the huge advantages of application of energy _in place of_ human labor.

The primary factor leading to economic instability is consumer credit, and the secondary factor is failure to proactively manage availability of resources. Economic growth doesn't necessarily correlate with resource consumption, where technology allows for more efficient use of resources. But where resource supply issues create bottlenecks, economic growth is retarded.

So the solutions to a cyclical economy are:  a) use credit for production rather than consumption;  b) rely on clean energy and technology _applied efficiently_ to substitute for human labor; and c) anticipate resource supply bottlenecks, and meet them in advance.

Then the next challenge is figuring out how consumer products can be allocated effectively when labor is in oversupply. Here the problem is not the availability of viable solutions, but the reticence of humans to accept novel economic models.",2023-12-19T15:26:59Z

Every time a company lays off people to replace with AI, those people flood the job market and employers lower wages because they know people are desperate for a job! It‚Äôs already happening. This is the destruction of capitalism in the making. She‚Äôs stoked because she‚Äôs already rich with plenty of money to invest in the few big winners to get even more rich (which she probably knows she needs to prep for the collapse). But when this goes far enough and everyone is on unemployment, then they can‚Äôt find a job for an entire year, then the unemployment money stops coming in, what then!? We all just become homeless and die? What a BS presentation! We need to redistribute the wealth with universal basic income ASAP. The job market is already flooding. Starting one year from now and then worse every year, millions of overqualified people will have no job opportunities, and just die on the streets if the rich keep giving us this BS narrative. 

Shame on TED for this. The people deserve the TRUTH and governments need to start working on a serious plan to transition to a post-labor system. Their precious stocks collapse too if most people don‚Äôt have jobs to even pay for anything. Then the big bank run will cause the total collapse of society and send us into a Great Depression where everyone is killing each other to survive. 

But let‚Äôs just pretend like that‚Äôs not going to happen and promote businesses as usual while we all use AI to replace all the jobs with no UBI plan. Greed will be our downfall. What a shame. I sure hope the leaders pull their heads out soon enough. 

If the wealthy would all just become philanthropists we could seriously potentially transition smoothly to a post-labor utopia. Capitalism would be dead, our lives would be simpler, but they would be great without work. Capitalism needs to end anyway. It will kill us even if the AI collapse doesn‚Äôt. We need the plot of iRobot to happen but instead of us locking them up at the end, we let them take our jobs and save us with free essentials gifted by the rich to sustain the human race.

The question is casually avoided because the answer is clear and has been known for the past century: death.

Yes, the data still has to be verified from its source which is why digital identity systems are needed, luckily we already have those systems in place that complement it like kyc and novel solutions like worldcoin.

Is it making kids able to solve problem, focusing on the product (e.g. the correct solution of an equation)? Or is it helping kids developing the mathematical thinking? in the example provided the ""AI personal assistant"" points out to the correct application of a rule (distributing the factor to the numbers inside the parenthesis). However there is no help in uderstanding the ""WHY"" of such a rule. I would think that a good teacher should help stundents UNDERSTANDING why such a rule exists, working on their high level thinking skills, rather than focusing (only?) on their ability of remembering and applying a rule...but then again I am not so familiar with the Khan Academy so maybe that kind of thinking is developed in other parts of their math programme?",2024-05-04T08:36:54Z

2023-10-31T03:00:45Z,@Sparrowthorn,hJP5GqnTrNo,"A very clear and compelling talk, as you'd expect from Sal Khan. While I'm ""all in"" on the Math, I find the Jay Gatsby example a little troubling. When a student is able to ""ask Jay Gatsby"" (the Khanmigo ""bot"") the significance of the green light on Daisy's dock then when it replies, posing as ""Jay Gatsby"", it's just spoon-feeding an answer. The student has not had to figure anything out for herself which in the arts is critical (just as much as in math). 

Why? Because reading a work of literature is an act of ""co-creation"" between writer and reader. When we read ""Gatsby"", each of us forms our own Jay Gatsby in our minds conjured by the magic Fitzgerald's words, coupled with the work of our own (unique) imagination. This is what gives art its power.

Khan's bot, however, is serving up a kind of Big Mac version of Gatsby (lots of ""old sports"" and not much else). The student's interactions with this fake (lightweight) version of the character are by definition superficial. She's not engaging in the infinitely more rewarding act of imaginative creation, in the company of a great writer. As a result her impression of the book is likely to be shaped by the bot, and not by Fitzgerald.

Last point‚ÄîI'm OK with this if it's just ""training wheels""...getting kids over the first hurdle in reading a work of literature (one that they'd probably not read without the assistance of the bot). But once the student gets some momentum, they should be encouraged‚Äîand in a school setting, required‚Äîto switch off the tech, otherwise they'll be short-changed.",2023-10-31T03:00:45Z

Unfortunatelly, it is still largely ignored what this might lead to when these models and the usage are further improved. Someone will let an advanced model ""run free"" (using all kinds of online resources) to solve a problem.

o  The speaker argues that AI can be used to enhance education rather than undermine it if the proper safeguards and regulations are put in place.
o  AI tutors and teaching assistants can give every student a personalized tutor and every teacher an AI assistant. This could help address the ""two sigma problem"" of improving student outcomes.
o  The speaker shows examples of an AI called Khanmigo helping students learn math, coding, literature, and writing. It provides tailored feedback and encouragement.
o  Khanmigo can also be used by teachers to help create lesson plans, grade assignments, and prepare to teach new topics. This could save teachers a lot of time currently spent on administrative tasks.
o  While some are optimistic or pessimistic about AI, the speaker argues we should take an active role in ensuring it's developed and applied responsibly. If we pause progress out of fear, others may accelerate their AI for negative uses. But we must also fight for positive use cases like using AI to enhance human intelligence and potential.",2023-07-10T02:30:08Z

Say- if we were to ask the AI to grade a whole student body, a school for example- on a piece of creative writing- how would the grades received by the students from the AI, correlate with the grades between different teachers. What would that tell us about the AI and the teachers? 
How would we make an optimal ""marking"" machine, while improving ourselves by using it?
How do we even begin to decide what a ""statistical anomaly is"", when the question is no longer- concensus, but optimization. 

The obvious answer is trial and error, but the thing you are playing with here- education, is not unimportant. In fact, if the ""error"" part goes really wrong, that's a recipe for apocalypse. Terrible education and unsustainable beliefs are the most likely thing that might end our existence. That's my opinion though. I just don't want to see us fail.",2023-06-24T23:22:16Z

Kudos to you, developed countries can utilise this and keep being developed while developing countries try to sort themselves out.

Unfortunately he's quite wrong when it comes to the last couple minutes of this talk.  We can't wait for ""when the problems arise"" because, for AI, that is too late.  None of the past is relevant to this new situation, because we've never had to deal with what is effectively alien entities with intelligence on par to or greater than our own.  That makes this completely different than anything humans have faced before.  If we let AIs get smarter than humans without dealing with all the safety aspects BEFORE THEN it will be too late.  This is a situation where humanity can't wait until there are problems to try and fix them after the fact.  I'd like to point out that all the positive thinking in the world regarding education won't matter - if there aren't humans to educate in the future.  On our current path with attitudes like this (towards AI safety) where we race ahead building AIs that are well beyond what we can ensure safety for will lead to a horrible outcome for humanity.  It doesn't need to be that way, but doing it safely would require patience and a focus on safety instead of rapid unchecked progress but too many people just don't take AI safety seriously and if this trend continues it has a high likelihood of leading to disaster.",2023-05-14T18:31:10Z

I wonder if the advancements in these technologies actually present a significant challenge for human purpose. I think there is value in learning for its own sake. But there is something about knowing that what you are learning can be done effortlessly and better (assuming it is an effective tutor) by the bot teaching you that challenges the practical utility of the learning.

I don't mean to be a downer here. I think we have to move forward, there is no putting this back in the box. But it does present challenges even for very positive use cases.",2023-05-06T08:33:30Z

I hope in such an influenctial and potential position Mr. Sal khan could comment on his thoughts about this. 

On the other hand, he has not mentioned a single aspect about the data that this AI has trained on and would train on in the future. What kind of biases or errors are hidden in this data? Who screens this data? 
This probably is going to be the most impactful AI tool ever and it is going to touch every learning child and adult in the corners of the world. So, these and more questions need to be listened to and debated in length especially by the creators of these tools.

Khanmigo can detect student mistakes, ask students to explain their reasoning, and help them to better understand concepts. It can also quiz students, answer their questions, and connect the video content they are watching with other ideas.

I adore that Khanmigo is being taught to ""think"" before it ""speaks."" A novel concept. Still many questions. Top of my list: At what age does the Khan Academy team think kids should be exposed to AI? How will the data from student's conversations with Khanmigo be presented to teachers in a way that's useful? Will using Khanmigo for lesson planning lead to better or more uniform pedagogy? How do we prepare students to discern and differentiate between speaking with an AI powered historical figure vs. fictional character vs. inanimate object (the Mississippi River?). The two sigma data is interesting and relevant. How much thought is being put into where these tools dovetail with children's cognitive development and differences, including supporting executive function development.

Also, people that's creative enough don't have the need for an AI companion, maybe only if they're really stuck and they're in the need of ideas. Keep this in mind, the same day this was released Chegg stock went down almost 50% because they lost a lot of their students clients to AI.

2023-05-04T02:30:42Z,@sharmashyam,hJP5GqnTrNo,"I lost all the thousand ton of respect that I had for Sal Khan after listening to this talk. First, he's going to ""give"" ""everyone"" in the ""world"" -- you got the point -- he's THAT filled with a strange brown man's burden filled by Sillicon Valley. Khan Academy has been a blessing for those who have had access to it. But look at the attempts to give laptops to kids around the world. Look at the increasing digital divide. And Khan should know about the world beyond California. He may be right about AI's ability to do the math and even do a thousand things with language. But he's looking at the world through his company's lens alone: he's lost perspective (or perspectives). The ""super tutor"" is fine -- but wouldn't it need to first become capable of ""factually correct"" answers on simple issues, not to mention leaving it alone to guide children?! He seems to believe AI is going to tackle complexities of history and philosophy, and he also seems to believe it can help students with current events. All that while, he completely ignores that these tools are only good with the most motivated students.  AI tools are extremely helpful in some cases, hit or miss, but they are also based on the fundamental flaw: they're agnostic to facts, contexts, cultures, and ethics BY DESIGN, unless certain behaviors are subtracted from them, and that doesn't go very far. I wouldn't be so bothered by this presentation if it wasn't done like a promo, instead of an educator making a critical and nuanced assessment -- and we know why: Khan has money to make from this marketing. I've lost my trust of him entirely because of this.",2023-05-04T02:30:42Z

I hope in such an influenctial and potential position Mr. Sal khan could comment on his thoughts about this. 

On the other hand, he has not mentioned a single aspect about the data that this AI has trained on and would train on in the future. What kind of biases or errors are hidden in this data? Who screens this data? 
This probably is going to be the most impactful AI tool ever and it is going to touch every learning child and adult in the corners of the world. So, these and more questions need to be listened to and debated in length especially by the creators of these tools.

law has multiple issues: not enough lawyers, not enough judges, not enough courts. the result is almost all cases end in a plea deal and lawyers are incentivized to push their clients towards a plea deal.

for doctors and educators though the 1 on 1 care is SO MUCH better than what we have. having a doctor who knows you beyond just your test results, who can give you their full undivided attention will give you much better outcomes than one who is seeing hundreds of patients.

might be a while before we see doctors or lawyers replaced by AI, the legal structure wouldn't allow for it.",2023-05-02T19:44:18Z

2023-05-02T19:05:00Z,@glamastro,hJP5GqnTrNo,"Yeah, AI will be a great tool in  education moving forward, but the part that i think gets overlooked is if you want to still do the thing you were doing before.

Like interacting with AI is a lot of fun, using it to co-write stories is a blast... have it teach me in a way no teacher or even the biggest group of teachers possibly can is all great, but the teal question is will the students still want to learn? 

And the thing about mastery is, it is quite falsely human defined. 
Like imagine struggling with test as a 7th grader. You did not do well. Now, years later, you could attempt the same test and absolutely dominate easily. 

Imagine if on the basis of that 7th grade test, all career paths were laid down before you. It would be horrible  because you did so badly. 

That is precisely what happens, although later in life. It's not like you couldn't do well if given more time (clearly you can), its that society broadly defines the way you should do  well in a given timeframe, and enter society based on that result.  Society actively stunted your growth... 

Motivation is quite complicated,  and all points i make will have exceptions, but think about the internet. A hub of all information ever known to mankind.

What did it do to the population? Did it make everyone super smart?Did most people actively learn beyond their schooling years? No, it made the majority mindless scrollers, masked haters, and cringey short video creators  with ever so decreasing positive traits(again, not all, but many).. 

So, tools are great if they are helping with what you are trying to accomplish. Though most  radical tools change the very thing you try to accomplish, and in this day and age, its mostly negative.",2023-05-02T19:05:00Z

The statistic shown in the beginning on student success with and without tutoring hasn‚Äôt taken into account the type of students who opt for tutoring. And generally, his argument is placed on the premise that ‚Äúeveryone wants a tutor‚Äù. But no, they don‚Äôt. Some people really don‚Äôt want to learn and would rather take the easiest way out to stay above grade x.  (And this isn‚Äôt to say that some are dumb and some are smart. Highly intelligent people also often find ways to avoid learning things that are uninteresting and therefore trivial to them.) AI will be an absolute game changer for all of those who are curious but it‚Äôll be very difficult to get the students with not much curiosity towards academic matters to use these AI tutoring tools autonomously. Some people are more inclined to work with their hands or do physical labour and I think we really need to pay attention to these people to avoid creating an even larger social divide between the academically inclined and the not-so-much-so. 
So no, I don‚Äôt think we should try to take it slow with AI, but rather, to take advantage of it as efficiently as possible while making sure it doesn‚Äôt disproportionately benefit only a certain group of people, or in this case, only certain types of students.",2023-05-02T07:13:56Z

Perhaps an important skill for students using AI to learn is to ask follow-up questions, such as: 'who first stated this?', 'are there any alternative perspectives?', or 'where can I find a discussion of this topic?'. That's also something that AI educators can be trained to provide within their answers, prompting the student to weigh up elements of one argument relative to another, or suggesting exercises that could improve understanding. 

Teaching students that learning is about critical thinking and interpreting information rather than regurgitating it is a challenge as it is, and AI tools are sure to complicate things - but with some training and forward thinking I think that educators can help students get the best out of them.",2023-05-13T06:41:03Z

2024-03-28T16:24:47Z,@olyapashchuk2580,HKkmcMy6_A8,"How AI Can Make Life Better:

Healthcare Help: Computers that learn can help doctors find problems and give better advice to help people get better faster.

Things Made Just for You: Smart computers can understand what you like and give you things that fit you perfectly, like movies, clothes, or even help you learn in school.

Saving Stuff: Computers can help us use things like energy or water more wisely, so we don't waste them and keep the planet healthy.

School for Everyone: Smart tools can teach people who can't go to regular schools because they're far away or too expensive. This way, everyone can learn and get smarter.

Finding New Things: Computers can help scientists discover new stuff faster, like better materials or ways to help stop climate change.

Dangers of AI:

Not Always Fair: Sometimes, computers can make unfair decisions because they learn from old information that's not fair to everyone.

Jobs Going Away: Some jobs might not be needed anymore because computers can do them faster and cheaper.

Privacy Problems: Computers can know a lot about us, and sometimes, they know too much. It's important to keep our personal stuff safe.

Big Decisions: Sometimes, computers make big choices on their own, and it's hard to know who's responsible if something goes wrong.

It's good to know about these problems, but we shouldn't be too scared. With the right rules and careful thinking, we can make sure computers help us without causing harm.",2024-03-28T16:24:47Z
