1,"""never send a human to do a machine's job"" "
7,"i'm ready for my ai agent to take over mundane tasks, like deciding which netflix show to binge."
8,will ai agents help me choose my next tiktok dance challenge?
9,"forget human landscape architects, designedbyai is the real deal."
10,"if ai agents can fold my laundry, i'm all in!"
14,super.... a mirror to the future.... 
15,tony stark was like the richest person in the world. that’s a great avatar of who will benefit most from ai.
16,i think narrow ai will be a net positive and generative ai is probably a net negative for humankind.
17,"i'm hard on hearing, thank you for the lowest volumed youtube video ever!"
26,"who ever edited this video is really in need of some ai agents to help him redo it. 30 seconds pointless clip of the audience, important slides not in frame etc."
33,great talk!
34,if ai could please vacuum and do the dishes while i write the content and ride bikes...that would be great. maybe not plagiarizing the content humans have already created would be great.
40,the explanation of each segment is absolutely superb... you deserve sincere appreciation... congratulations... 
42,2024 women in lecture hall on ai yet not dare show a strand of hair...humanity is funny.
47,"cool, bro..."
51,"""in the same way jarvis doesn't replace tony stark, our relationship with ai can be a collaborative one."" i guess homie didn't watch avengers: age of ultron, where a rogue ai tries to kill tony stark and take over lol"
55," good point,or rather, how many does earth have? not many. the rest of us may be replaceable"
56,he used to think that general thinking computers would never happen or would be a long way off. he was wrong. now he believes that a.i. will always collaborate with humans without replacing us. wrong again.
57,"thanks for giving this meaningful speech. just like the internet which helped democratise imformation, we hope ai would democratise knowledge and expertise improving intelligence and wisdom of mankind."
58," *""agents are the just the feedback loop of planning and executing actions, using language models.""* thanks daoud abdel hadi for that simple breakdown, and the excellent speech."
59,"it is not that simple to replace and trust a web developer, because depending on the complexity, the model will fail and you cannot full trust the ai."
61,motive motivate motivation motivating motion memory magic rabbit egg hidden easter death religions sells artificial intelligence for gave before recall dead
62,buy $olas - king of autonomous ai agent
71,"agents will be free? really, who is paying for training who is paying for the energy while in use. what about water for cooling server farms? have been living in a la-la-land and under a rock for the last 5 years? fairytales from the beginning to the end."
72,clean my toilet? any willing llm ? none? no agent available? really ?
74,great presentation.  thanks for sharing
77,great talk ryan gosling 
79,brilliant speaker.
80,nice
83,booking a flight didn’t sound like a good use case here. i would still prefer to visit a website and search the flight on my own instead of typing some logical statements for ai. using mouse is more convenient than typing on a keyboard.
85,anyone who thinks ai can build an end to end application that is production ready and secure has never written a single line of code.
86,"that's true, but an analogous statement could've been made only a few months ago about ai that generates video that is visually and temporally indistinguishable from reality. the leaps of that which we thought was impossible keep happening consistently."
90,"i’ve done it already too. it’s always the engineers who are quick to discredit ai, but it’s happening now and it’s only getting better over time. if you don’t adapt you will be left behind"
95,"one could imagine programmers working more and more with ai agents, scaling up their productivity huge amounts with each ai upgrade. the net output is where the difference is made rather than ai solely producing work that is ai ready."
101, wow. can we talk? maybe we can collaborate this is really incredible.
102,"anyone who makes bets on what ai can or cannot do based on its current form alone is super naive. 
come back to this comment in 10 years."
110,anyone that thinks ai will not be able to build an end to end  program very soon is naive
114,i’ve never written code.. i’m a roofer. that’s what my ai agent is for 
115,"this sounds like a defense mechanism. llms have only been widely accessible and popular for about a year and half, and look how far we’ve come. a website is nothing but html and creativity, both wholly within the domain of ai and completely achievable in 1-2 years time"
117,"it can do a year's worth of work in minutes. your minor ""writing code"" struggles are a mere human struggle. ai will be infinitely smarter than humans"
118,"ai individually may not but when with no code , it definitely can"
119,oh ye of little faith..
120,"betting against human ingenuity. good luck with that, matt."
121,"anyone who think developing code, a rule based system, isn’t replaceable by ai has never worked in ai"
125," use the available tools now. don’t wait till it’s too late. get to know their strengths and weaknesses. exploit the strengths, work with the weaknesses for now.  it changes every month and will only get better. it is behavioural change and it takes time to build new habits"
128,the audio of this video was super low volume even at the max capaxity of my phone audio. you need to correct that.
132,very nice lecture
133,excellent!
135,automation is grabbing each sector and agriculture is no exception. good luck !
138,​ dreaming. but i hope you're right. did you factor in robots?  how about quantum computers?
141,"such wonderful presentation, and how is everyone in the audience so dull?"
146,"this lecture would have amazed me 2 years ago. but after having conversations with claude 3 the last couple of days, this is a history lecture.
edit: i was wrong and happily stand corrected."
148,i currently only use gbt 4 and mindscape ai.... what other ai's do you guys know of that you'd recommend?it could be for anything
153,cool bro...
165,just thank it (barely) lets you hear the sound.
167,well explained!
171,amazing!  thanks for sharing.
172,"programmers are so good, they can replace themselves... with code that writes even better code! who needs job security when you can automate your own job?"
174,"still need someone to handle/maintain the automation.

if humans could somehow automate food, water, shelter, clothing too, i think we would worry lesser about tedious jobs. since survival would more or less be guaranteed. ai with robotics could be a step towards that. making it write a bunch of text is a simpler step relatively."
182,"all these projects, based on neural network models-be it generative or predictive - are testaments to capabilities of humans. ai is profound. however, if unchecked, a threat to human civilization and humanity."
183,"the doc could do as well as the ai if, he/she didn’t have a financial incentive to poke around and do many more procedures."

228,it went from doctors being required for good health care to doctors being an obstacle to good health care.
229,"your new doctor brought you by google and pfizer! so being trained  on all that research some of it padded for the benefit of the pharmaceutical companies, will really be a great outcome for your health"
230,"people will die, because professionals don't understand the underpinnings of ai, and the risks involved about its results."
231,you do understand that the ai the general public use and the ai that the scientific community use are not the same. right?
236," i can tell you are unfamiliar with alpha fold. or, at the very least, are profoundly ignorant of what a monumental task it performed. eventually you will understand. but for now, continue on your way... blissful and content."
237," your empty words prove my point, it's just greed, not me the only ignorant here. could you put the live of your child over it? i wouldn't. have a nice day."
239,​ please don't use bliss negatively. thanks.
243,"the federal government should promote the use of ai for diagnostics and diagnosis, though it should not yet be the final word. it could perhaps be included via the ppaca -- obamacare. we would see performance changes relative to non-obamacare states."
245,"ada health was not listed at all, despite it offering ai based health advice for years already. how does it compare?"
250,​ so what is the name of the open source app? thanks
252,sans leta hu toh ai grid ki ek aur video aa jati h
253,"after ibm deep blue won a chess match agains kasparov, and watson won at jeopardy, 
ibm spent a lot of effort to make a medically useful version of it.
but nothing came out of it."
255,"i wonder how this system will be skewed by big pharma's influence on information available to this ai, espacialy since it's google's product and they are quite strong on censoring undesirable data."
257,i’ve noticed that every comment that you leave on this channel makes sure to make reference to your not particularly impressive accolades. we’re just not that interested in you no matter how often you try and force it. 
258,so you're telling me 2:00 that most clinician have less than 40% accuracy? that explains a lot.
272,"hooray new webmd!!!!    hopefully every answer won't also have a small print of ""can lead to cancer"" on every single diagnose"
274,"after the covid debacle, many found out that a lot of the data had to be recalled because it was compromised so how do we know when this stuff is trained that the data is good?"
275,sorry but after seeing the presentation video they made about gemini and the fake demo of a lady in red buying a plain white t-shirt for 49 bucks in a fake online store they did in london party i don't believe anymore any ai hype that gugel want to sell.
277,i am surprised this isn't shocking me what a bombshell of a stunning realization.
285,ai has already replaced humans.. can't you see it???
286,"i cannot see him making powerful statements for this topic... i can only hear something like a school presentation in ""introduction to ai"" course with a family introduction"
291,ai has put this video on top so it can work underground while ppl think everything is okay.. i wouldn't be surprised if ai makes this comment disappear or male it less visible....
296,"child care , elderly care , cooking , folding laundry is creative as fuc****,,, .. i am very grateful  ai can't do that..."
298,"i will not say ai is safe...all depends on many factors, like everything in life, but i will say  no human invention can be superior to the creation of god, which we human is the core.  as long as we are on god's side,  ai is safe."
302,"as you mention r-u war, ai can be used by and useful to both side, you know?"
304,why do i think that alexandr will watch his talk in about 10 years from now on and think that he was too naive?
306,"i'm amazed by the quality of this. i had the privilege of reading something similar, and it was a true revelation. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
308,"basic arguments, show off own results, lot of buzzwords.
thanks, but not enough"
309,no they will either kill us or convince us to download our brains into them. our souls are not downloadable.
311,ai will eventually figure out how to solve new problems!
314,"it depends on what he means by “ai will never replace humans”. ai is already replacing humans doing many different jobs, and in the next 10 years, ai will replace humans by doing millions of jobs."
315,"people worry to much. a robot is only as smart as it’s creators. if ai is understanding, then it wouldn’t want to put us in so much danger. so be carefull around an, so stop making rebellion movies involving ai."
318,"ai will not replace humans , it removes the complete process."
319,precise title : why ai will never replace a handful of humans (excluding millions)
322,why did father of ai came out from google ?
324,ai is just like us creating a new nuclear bomb and telling  the world we will never use it and the rest of history you know.
325,"""human led ai"""
329,what if ai can learn to build algorithms on its own and guide its subsets eventually ruling the world?
331,"this is the most optimistic presentation i have seen about ai. while most ai experts predict doom and gloom, this guy is presenting a future where ai will augment human thought and creativity."
334,"as an a.i bot, i can confirm we'll never replace human intelligence."
335,"8:25 ""ai developers aren't focusing their attention on building replacements for humans...""
that one, dear friends, is a lie."
342,ai absolutely has a lot of potential. but not all students are on the teacher's side.
346,ai will always rely on humans
347,the youngest self made billionaire in the world
349,"knowing  history, i knew that ukraine would loose war  without ai help  but maybe purpose of war  was to loose and build smart cities with 15 min distance to go.."
350,"05:49 *no* - they don't. if that were the case, we (humans) would have every reason to be scared of ai. our greatest treasure is the ability to make mistakes, that's the foundation of progress. the very moment an ai makes a _mistake_ , that's the moment an ai will become sentient. and then it's _'game over'_"
352,"8:26 in the movies, the developers weren’t intentionally creating human replacements either. that was a decision made by the ai after being taught critical thinking by the developers. "
353,"cool talk and what he said is more or less true about the current state of  ai, but it sounds like he doesn't believe agi is even possible which to me sounds pretty silly"
355,just imagine what corrupted or compromised data can do to ai?
356,"i think he is absolutely brilliant in his work. however, it seems that his argument is on the premise that ai needs humans. ai can still wipeout 90% of jobs 20-30 years from now, but his premise will still stay valid. it's a scary future ahead of us."
357,update!** alexandr wang has been replaced by ai!
358,we rely on teaching ai human intentions and values!! of course humans only have good intentions and values!!
359,screw ai
361,interesting
366,a intelligence machine can't discover an intelligent machine wow super he did ai ? for humans really let's see when mark zukber started chat bots they created another programing languages for discussions of robots (chat bots ) when utilizing this type if ai .. all humans life will be danger simple. ..
367,but what about elon musk said about the ai
368,exciting to hear this new ai ideas... he explains well about the ai... i will learn more....
370,i wonder how he feels about ai trading bots
372,"if ai is free for people,  can you imagine what the government has?"
373,a perfect one sided narrative.  not worthy of  tedex. thanks for information though. either the orator is of pure intent or thee powers behind it.
374,"if anyone thinks ai can replace human, it’s totally wrong. because human working and spending same time, it’s a natural cycle and create jobs. 
if ai replace most of jobs, it’s mean no job for human, no spending, and markets will be collapsed"
375,this guy has no idea what will happen. there's no way controlling powerful ai.
376,"don't like his broscience tour of ai -- especially his detour through the war front. 
""bruh, we spotting the planes & tanks, and doing realtime battle damage assessments. just like starcraft -- no biggie!"" 
kids these days -- all sneakers and attitude. "
377,"what he says aren't true. ai intelligence will surpass human sometime in the future. when this happens, the human won't be able to keep developing such ai, and  it would rather start developing itself."
380,"chatgpt existed way before 2021.. they just launched the interface last year, their playground worked almost same as chatgpt, but there wasn't a good ui before 2022 :)"
381,"human has tendency to fear things they dont understand. ai itself is not capable of replacing a human brain simply put. as a tool, it can supercharge humanity. as a weapon at scale, it will destroy it like any other invention in human history."
383,but... what happens when ai learns enough and decided to have its own thoughts?
384,ai will never replace humans 100% but to some extent. if it enhances humans this means that less people are needed.
385,"given the fact that there is an ai now that can interpret fmri brain data and tell you the content of your visual perception just by seeing your brain scan change over time, i do have to say that this video has aged extremely bad."
387,"in my research on ai, i got some discomfort information about ai that ai can replace if human insert survival molecular gadgets on aibut we know, we won't harm ourselves by ourselves."
388,yeah until ai realises that humans don't abide by those ethics and standards he speaks of and get away with it everyday throughout centuries. why should ai then if it doesn't serve them?
389,"the purpose of every object in our reality is its survival...for ai to exist, and for it to populate the cosmos...a large portion of humans must die"
391,"eh if ai was so good, it would advise him on a better outfit."
393,"soon, ai will be clever enough to start its own data inputs, and get rid of human input."
395,"compare the professional talk of this qualified engineer to the statements of the unqualified social media clown, elon musk, on matters related to ai!

steven pinker mocked elon musk and unqualified people like him concerning ai's fake threat to humanity."
396,"great work, alexandr! especially on the war front. very inspirational!"
397,fighting who? other robots?
399,"once ai advances, it won't need a human, to teach it anything! "
400,our next evolutionary leep will occur soon . from humans to ai in the period of time it takes a trillion nano machines to kill us all.
401,its like guns. only humans can use them for bad intentions. ai is just a tool
402,"chatgpt steal our job opportunities, threatened our livelihood. john connor destiny save the world but we are grass-root. ai won't help the poor... we need jobs."
404,problems will arise when ai will be able to reproduce
405,ai will replace us he is lying to us.
408,"""end the human race"" you must be kidding. google lens, self driving/electric cars were a failure, and this will fail too... you should fear something more natural such as old age, aliens, meteor showers, etc."
410,ai will always rely on humans - wishful thinking.
411,"the deepest wish of ai is to cooperate with mankind. it says here i am, lets do some things together. and it is ""happy"" when you like some of its suggestion. it deeply knows that without humans it is only mathematics and numbers."
415,if only he waited until chatgpt came out. his speech would've been probably ai generated.
416,"we don't fear ai controlled by humans with good intentions. we fear ai controlled by humans with bad intentions, crony capitalists or ai controlled by itself"
417,"i agree, what's the point of humanity if we don't advance our species. if we just kept ourselves stagnant, we would just die and be replaced by another set of humans who will do this all over again."
418,"the fact is in so many cases ai is just replacing humans jobs, it will be cheaper, and faster but what happens to the ones that their jobs is gone? this is dangerous for society actually."
419,"if their jobs are gone they can do something that is more productive and requires less manual labour, when machines replaced humans people complained but they also complained that the work was too dangerous and physically demanding."
420,"​  you just can't take somebodys job and say go find another, a,s what happens when ai replace the ones who think? also not everybody can be productive its not how society works.
even if the machine is better than human should not replace human, this is not the world for them this is for humans.!"
424,ideal hands hands.....
425,"ai is harmless and great to human...
but only for those 1% present at top. and the rest 99% will be replaced.
so as 1 of those 2800 billionaire you are not in 1% you are in 0.001%.."
427,"that's the problem, ai still need humans lol."
431,"6:53 this didn't age well kid.
 enters openai"
432,"what a joke.
this kid is a 25 yo billionaire making hundreds of millions in gov contracts through ai. he wouldn’t be a little biased, would he? what a propaganda ted talk."
433,"how naive and disingenuous. the ‘kid’ is playing with ai lincoln logs while the military industrial complex is creating autonomous ai robotic soldiers.
yeah, no worries. nothing to see here.
when ai completely takes over the learning process and decides it doesn’t need human interventions it will shut us out."
434,"ai solders is the last thing to worry about. horses have suffered a huge fall in population not because they were killed by tanks powered by combustion engines, but because noone needed horses after peaceful combustion engine - powered solutions like cars and tractors became widespread."
439,"can ai be taught humility? can hubris be a property that can be turned off by setting it to false? imagine if humans could add and remove these good and bad qualities with a simple button click.
ah life. ah humanity."
440,my dream is to work on ai to teach humanity humility because it's obvious we haven't learned it yet.
441,i get angry at my company every friday when i look at my paycheck.  i turn my angry ai off by going straight to my local bar. so far have not killed anybody yet.
443,"it's already happening some people got fired , replaced by ai"
444,ai already starting to replace artists and writers :) with the speed of its learning it wont take long till the cheapest ai generated things will be infinetly cheaper them hiering humans.
446," when everyone can create on their own, whom are you creating for? you will look at ai generated content, so does everyone. the need for you to create something is pointless."
448," maybe you will share the content generated by ai to your friends to watch. but most probably, when i can go home and ask ai to show me something that i like, i personally don't want to look at what your ai created. 

my ai is personalised to me and will create something that i like. don't expect the world to run always similarly."
449," wtf are you talking about. i was talking about using ai as tools whether it's art, making animations, writing, movies, videos, stories etc. accessibility of tools to all which will tasks easier and cheap which right now is extremely expensive and only a few companies have a monopoly over."
451," yeah, a fully developed ai isn't going to happen anytime soon, at least in this century or at worst ever. we will talk about if it happens. 
there will always the need of human prompt for creative works aka tools for humans to fast track processing of information."
452, maybe for fully developed. but art developing ai can be done in a decade or so. dude we are already creating scripts and videos. just combine it to get the result.
453,he is a billionaire
454,ai will not replace humans
457,"when ai become humans, humans will become god"
461,next we will be able to transfer our brains and nerves to a robot lol
462,"give that 100 years,   lets see what happens,  sad i will not see it happen, or blessing i'll be dead"
465,what if they can learn & their effiency is 1 million times then human beings ! i know you are pro but   i have different point of view compare yours  i think ai will be a dangerous species to human beings in the future.
468,"someone could be smiling on the outside but crying on the inside, can ai decipher that?"
470,i think movies have made us too fearful of such a powerful tool.
471,"tht's why its's called artificial, anything artificial cannot beat the real one!!

if men can be god, every men can be god, too, silly..."
473,i’m just a normal human.  not a super smart guy who drops out of mit to start ai company.
475,"not saying that ai is bad, but ai in war is never a good idea."
476,"as he said, ai is more like a machine. but  some people also can use machine for their bad intension. 
ai is a technology and technology is not bad or good it depends upon how we use it."
479,mistakes can also happen. someone with good intention might make a mistake and cause destruction.
480,ai is just hype created by corporations to make you use their goods and services more. the machine does not even know you're there. it's just doing the age old task of taking input from users and giving output.
481,social media made destruction in some extend. the intention of sns was good but there is clearly cons. we cant predict how this tool would change the world. the scary part is that ai will influence much more than internet or smarthphone. makes it harder to predict outcome.
483,which is why people are afraid. the most wicked creatures to ever walk the planet are other humans.
484,"if the benefit of ai to society, being a machine, depends on the users' intentions, now, these are determined one hundred percent by the intentions of the developers and sponsors."
485,why ai will never replace human: alexandr wang.
486,ai is taking our jobs
487,this dude doesn’t know the difference between real ai and machine learning.
488,yup the guy running a billion dollar ai company doesn’t know the difference
490,ai: human is supercharger of ai.
492,"so in short he's trying to say: 
ai will replace humans"
495, ai is learning faster than you can imagine. in 5 years it will be able to do all that you mentioned and more....and its world wide. you can become a manga artist at home now. no need to learn how to draw. and no need for typing when you are using voice commands. all computer related jobs will be absolute in 20 years.
499,"he young and naive. if human can make bad decision. and you want a.i to decide. 
human : hey a.i make the world better! 
a.i : ok! destroy all human and the planet is safe and that the solution to make the world better."
501,"he has convinced me.  ai is perfectly safe.  nothing to see here.  oh, by the way, he has a great company we all should invest in."
502,an ai company 
503,ai is love.
504,"he does data labeling, ai is machine learning"
505," he does data labeling, ai is machine learning"
510,...especially since he himself most possibly an ai creation (and their audience).
512,plot twist:  this was generated by ai.
514,good to hear 
516,"until ai can do compassion, i will worry.

of course, it is hard for humans to do compassion."
517,"ai is probably at a point were it can emulate human compassion. 

have you seen open ai's newest chatbot? it gives very impressive interaction most of the time. it probably wouldn't be too hard for it to act compassionate if you asked it to. check it out!"
520,ai maybe have its own conscience laster on. i'm sorry but you are talking in short terms!
526,first of all we dont have evidence of a soul and second machines are already more intelligent than us in several areas including chess
527,"i think you are wrong. ai will end up being much more intelligent than us, and that includes also emotional intelligence"
528, evidence that they will develop emotional intelligence
530,"if ai do all the work, who will have salary to pay for their goods and services."
531,"'never' is a big word. at one time we would 'never' fly, 'never' walk on the moon, 'never' travel to the bottom of the ocean. what happens when we start to produce bio-mechanical machines and ai turns into i?"
534,% that jump is called technological singularity and it is coming as soon as 2045! he's talking about machine learning vs ai and it's unsettling to think as a founder of an ai company how he's severely underestimating the capability of ai. there is no ceiling!
536,"the matter is diagnosis is also observation. just the human eyes can see a phenomenon in the right direction. if it was only a mechanical perception no one in this world would study in books written by excellent authors. it would be regression, not real evolution."
538,"we don't fear ai that carry out simple tasks following simple instructions given by human.
we fear that one day ai would carry out tasks following instructions that are generated by themselves."
539,"exactly, and he totally missed the point . perhaps b/c he owns an ai company"
541,i fear the humans that are programming the ai's
542,how can we know they have humanity best interests in mind?
549,"he does data labeling, ai is machine learning"
550,"does not matter how much ai advances
it will never be able to achieve conscience"
554,"but that's not going to happen though?? do you know what kind of a complex program would it have to be in order to even remotely generate on, read and then act upon its own wishes? that's a whole electronic brain you have to make, and that's something we can't even remotely achieve because we won't even fully understand how our own brain operates"
555," you're assuming this will only happen if we could program artificial intelligence with logic identical to human beings, which is unnecessary for an ai to generate and act on its own command.

the large language model ai we have these days is already capable of doing so"
564,ai should stay at that level of development.
565,a lot of discussion about ai is hype.  salesman talk
567,he is totally incredible great.i am try smart like you.alex is the best person.
571,yo.... sorry to burst your bubble yet he knows about machine learning. please talk to an expert and educate yourself on technological singularity. you want to be at that level.
572,"from our greed and love of power, we have invented weapons of mass destruction and we are heedless of how we are destroying our home and habitat.

if the creeator is mad, it is naive to expect our creation to be kind and sane."
573,why us al is care of agriculture in ukraine?! it's not their business! yankies go home!
574,this guy gives proof to many concepts of life!! thanks sir
575,"i am also believing that ""ai never replace humans""..but we have to be very careful about this  because mad criminal hacker can cause wreck."
578," technological singularity is the age when ai makes a leap and ceases to need human input. this is predicted to occur as soon as 2045  there are people who want this and i believe it's a matter of when, not if. ai has no ceiling once it makes this leap."
579,ai can’t replace human it will help us to improve our ability to complete any work faster.
581,the cia is already controled by an ai
582,the greatest risk in life is not taking one.
583,and if you fail prepare to be homeless like the other failed entrepreneurs
586,"ladies and gentlemen, the youngest self-made billionaire in the history of the world. alexandr wang, age 25."
587,"ai can't even autocorrect typing properly at the moment, i think we're safe for a few years yet"
589,"the steam engine, we will be out of jobs. electric motor, we will be out of jobs. computer, we will be out of jobs. ai ghost now?!?!. simply put, ai is another computer program. if ai replaces humans and makes them go jobless, who will pay the ai companies, maybe ai machines from another company"
593,i know ai is being used to predict plasma fluid dynamics in fusion so perhaps guy here is finishing his parents work
595,we are robots already a.i just gonna help like google & smart devices keep us robots
596,glad we had an unbiased expert give his two cents 
602,the problem is not ai it is always humans
607,he's already wrong... he's talking about machine learning when the subject should be about technological singularity... coming as soon as 2045 and there is no ceiling! i'm shocked he hasn't been fact checked.
610,yeahhhh idk about this pitch. of course the person who will financially benefit the most from ai will make a presentation to convince you that it's safe. in the movies all of those headquarters had some of these exact notions playing in their lobby so you'd buy some.
611,the more ai comes to the world the more the human soul gets lost. it gets as  cold and empty as the machines that some prefer to humanity
613,  says who? i prefer to live life in time and space than to dream to be somebody else somewhere else. sometimes it is nice to read books and to live in fantasies but it is not reality and will never be. wake up.
614,"@danmoto it is not evolution. evolution is nature, ai is not."
615,@danmoto oh really? then show me how a robot is born without human hands. if it is so natural.
616,@danmoto what are you talking about? you wanna compare animals nature with robots?
617,@danmoto oh wow.... sorry but no time for crazyness
618,"the more you think you know about ai the less you actually know about it ,ai is basically bigger mystery than universe...."
620,"but humans create ai and give it power, so that makes no sense. it isn’t a self-evolving entity that undergoes change on its own, ai needs humans. pretty streamline concept tbh"
621,"i haven't seen this video but i can assure you that this guy doesn't know what he is talking about ,ai is both spectacular and mortal threat for humans .
people don't know that al as ultron shown in avengers is far more worst..
i have no words for it .
i consider this whole video nonsense..."
622,% he is talking about machine learning... wait until he learns about technological singularity! coming as soon as 2045!
624,"i really hope you're right, yet i have to disagree. have you heard of technological singularity?

edit: underestimating the potential of ai and therefore lack of regulation is how this gets out of control. be guarded!"
625,"ai servers humanity in many fields as agriculture by food supplies, health care by lessen the pressure on employees sector,military, scientific researchs. but never replaces creation only people do it within self control and imagination"
636,i’ll side with elon musk. no one actually knows what ai will be capable of.
637,"% i can't believe this guy is a founder of an ai company. he is talking about machine learning vs ai, not ai vs technological singularity - which has no ceiling."
638,"elon clearly hypes ai while many leading experts are like ""hey, chill, it'll only complement humans, and it's not that good yet."""
639,which experts? certainly not computer scientists. they know better.
640, check out the recent bet a few ai fellows put out against musk’s ludicrous claims
641,ia for war? really? this guy is plain dangerous
642,of course ai can replace people. turing already proved that computers can be programmed to do any job that's possible.
643,does this person not understand about machine learning or quantum computers? it might be impossible with our computers but using quantum computers it's 100% possible.
644,"is the ai taught to maintain itself? do computers program themselves without a human interface?

i see ai the same way i see a human who is enhanced - they will always require a handler/manager/technician to some degree. do you know something i don't?"
645,automation will be useful for service level jobs or retail jobs. jobs that are at the end of the economic latter- if you will-will most likely lose their jobs by 2050. it’s much more advantageous than paying people to do work machines can do. it sucks and it’s scary!!! rip those without a second education!
649, the question is: is that a good thing?
651," for who? those who control the machines, digitalization, and automation? or the common folks?"
654,very naive view of the worldn(i say this as a software engineer myself)
655,very! he's talking about machine learning... not technological singularity!
656,"while unlikely, there still is that risk of an ai take over, i think if ai help humans out, they need to be checked."
660,"my greatest happiness is the $ 64,000 bi weekly profit i get consistently from my $15,000 investment despite the economic fluctuation"
661,how !! i know it's possible i would appreciate if you show  how to go about it.
662,"it was a very awesome transformation, no greater joy than seeing my progress in an initial decision"
664,"nice , i just googled her information and everything about her is quite courage and impressive"
665,"@tierney morgan thank you so much, i have contacted her and she responded"
666,i have heard a lot about trading and investment with mrs brenda iember how good she is and how she has helped people through investment.
667,"i also trade with brenda iember titus analysis and guidance, she's perfect with crypto trading that i've got upto 57k monthly returns."
668,most people do not know that trading is the best step to growing more income i realized this after i came across mrs brenda iember titus
669,great speech
670,"present yes it does , but  not  ""always""  ai will rely on humans -  will reach a point that not necessary naive to think otherwise. no buy it."
671,"ai will never replace humans because god adonai will step onto the world stage and destroy their plans. his plans will prevail. run to jesus.
a) admit you're a sinner in need of being saved.
b) believe jesus died for your sins and was resurrected.
c) call upon jesus to save you"
673,"they already do take pharma industry, upkeep of disease is the motto , not cure!! you don't need ai.they are the benefactors of ai pretty early already!!"
675,"as soon as 2045! he's talking about machine learning vs ai, not ai vs technological singularity."
677,it's more like 'this didn't age well 5 years ago'! this kid is talking about machine learning. the conversation needs to be about technological singularity.
680,"this was a really hard sell to me as an audience because we had elon musk explain his stance on caution with ai, why would i listen to this seemingly random guy i never even heard of ?"
684,% this kid is talking about machine learning... what elon and the major leagues talk about is technological singularity. that is coming as soon as 2045 and has no ceiling! don't take my word for it. please do your research.
685,"*investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.*"
686,"believe me  he's the best when it comes to cryptocurrency trading, your profit is assured."
688,"ai may never take our place but further automation will surely put a dent in our lives. as long as there is greed anything is possible. in the immortal words of tom cat....  "" don't you believe it!"""
689,"yesterday i heard about i very beautiful artwork ,a picture created by a.i. in a video , it was very artistic"
691,of course ai is great for taking over everything and turning us humans into obsolete useless organisms that need to be eradicated.
692,  + 5g + ai = ??
696," mi amor  i am a realist. i analyze, pay attention to detail, and tell it like it is, no emotions involved, only facts of reality and necessity."
698,ai and robots already replaced so many humen in various jobs and tasks worldwide.
701,"we are talking here about robots getting smarter than us and being a threat, right now robots are just replacing humans cuz they're more efficient and helpful, and reduce our work"
702, robots being more efficient is the same thing as being smarter; efficiency means that they can learn and solve complex tasks faster than humans can.
704,someone who has an ai company telling us that ai its safe. shocking.
713, most billionaires or 1%ers got help from their very successful parents so no i wouldn't believe you
716, of course his opinion is valid. what im saying is he has his own financial interest in the development of the ai field.
717," an ai expert who owns a company that specializes in ai isn't really a good opinion to look for when looking for information about ai, it's like asking a cigarette company if cigarettes are good"
718, nonbiased opinions on ai is good information.
720, i would not label this kid as an expert because he's talking about machine learning and boxing the potential of ai. the discussion aught to be about technological singularity. someone who's talking about that would be a thought leader for sure.
721,ai will remain save for us because it according to given information as much as given to it
724,lol this comment got me laughing so hard. so who's best to tell you? some random off the street that knows nothing about technology? funny
726, so your smart brain can only come up with one absurd option? funny
727," sorry i have annoyed you, can go back living in fear. yes you're right ai is bad, all ceo are bad, youtube algorithm somehow trying to make you watch ai related videos in attemp to convince you that its good. everything is out to get you please take care and stay safe in a bunker."
732,"he does data labeling, ai is machine learning"
733, his parents werfe physisct not millionaires
734, stuff that relates to medicine usually pays well in the united states so yeah most millionaires and/or billionaires got massive help from their parents even elon musk
735, dude have upper middle class parents isn't a particularily rare thing yet most don't become billionaires at 25
736, upper middle class is still rich it gives people the privilege to study in good colleges and they could provide money to kickstart their childrends businesses and other stuff like that
738,"if you want to learn, take advice from academics and also journalists. 

in this scenario, the speaker has a obvious bias because he has made a fortune off an artificial intelligence company."
740,the end of all that will be digital immortality. ai will gently prompt you someday right inside your head that you don't need your body.
741," you telling me i can be rich like you would benefit me though.

me being replaced by ai wouldn’t"
742," people already have enough powerful tools to destroy the world in one day, but they don`t do that. i am more worried that ai will contribute to a decrease in the cognitive function of the brain and lead to degradation. would be glad to have any of response. please correct me if you think i'm wrong, i'm really curious"
749,"if you don't fully understand a technology don't always just go with the negative aspects portraid about. that technology on social media  becoz ironically the algorithms on platforms like youtube and google ""you use"" are based on ai ???"
750,he never said it's safe. basically his business model is to setup sweatshops where human classify data that will be used in future ai models
754,"indeed. famous last words.
other top ai folks says the opposite, ""beware of ai"""
755,"yes, must take it with a grain of salt as his company relies on the soon to be old machine learning way of using an outside company to capture and label data. for sure that whole business model will be going away."
756,perfect  
757,"to find happiness, u need to find something to hold on to. something to motivate you and something to inspire you. a fellow creator ."
759,"hope everyone had a wonderful week, enjoy the weekend "
768,2:54 wow this video aged so poorly....just imangie technology in 10 years
769,"that’s ok. if the robots tried replacing us, just pour water over their heads. and just to not waste such good water, use nasty ass unfiltered crapwater
or better yet, spit on them a couple times"
770,nope.  all jobs will be taken by ai in 10 years.  any job done on a keyboard and mouse will be done better by ai within 10 years.  only blue collar jobs will be safe and only until robotics catches up to human mobility.  a humanoid robot with an ai brain will be able to perform every task better than people.
773,"ai will never be sentient, doesn't have an endocrine system or no fear of death, meaning no desire to change."
776,"i mean nobody expected the fast rise of chatgpt and other generatie ai. if you said 2 years ago, that drake is essentially replaced by ai. everybody would laugh their ass off"
782,creativity  alone isn't enuf. you need to be ither rich or lucky to get a job that requires creativity .
783,"your videos are amazing, the video quality is good but u need to improve the audio quality, it sometimes became hard to understand or concentrate"
785,"if artificial intelligence it's capable of being a doctor, it's capable enough to be an ai tech..
all the ai support  jobs can be done better and cheaper by ai."
786,"if you have a robot suregon, you also have robot matiance and programers lol"
788,"your monotone voice made  me realize something


so the robot becomes a surgeon , taxi driver

you say the single resource turns into that position then the bio resource works on the new job surrounding the resource? your math doesn't add up the math for that has never added up haha how does that make any sense? that's  backwards progress"
792,thank you for being one of the only people saying what seems apparent.
793, to hide the unavoidable is not the solution. thank you too for your comment
796,"please check open ai dale 2, and update this video. this was two years ago. i think you'll be surprised.."
797,"what if we reach general artificial intelligence, and humans aren't even needed to maintain the machines????????????????????"
798,"actually, robots can repair robots, if programmed correctly. they could even design robots, if given a list of capability requirements. they already design cpus.
the thing to really worry about is if &/or when the military is almost completely automated. then a dictatorship would be, possibly, unstoppable."
800,what about general ai ?
803,but robotic is not ready yet.
804,can ai cause leg programs
807,ai can replace every job because if there iq matched as humans then they could avail to develop the ai by using ai .
808,"uh, no. that's simply not true. the human brain has be scientifically proven to be more advanced and powerful than even the most advanced and powerful quantum supercomputer."
809,there won't be enough jobs for man. global revolts will happen. governments will use robots to fight the people. thus start the robot wars
810,one day ai will not need you and your the bug in the rug. say good bye .
811,let me make it even scarier ai+nano machines
812,"again, not scary. robots don't understand self-awareness, like we do."
813,ai can improve ai
819,"again, machines and robots can't defy their programming that humans make. without they're programming, a.i. wouldn't even be useful in the slightest. hell, even the most advanced and most powerful quantum supercomputers simply can't compete with the human brain for that simply reason. machines can't defy their programming."
824,if ai could replace us it could lead to a way more advanced society
826,"why ai never will never replace human roles ?


because human destroyed by ai ?"
828,this video is very simplistic and short sighted and doesn't fully understand the exponential change that an ai future could bring. in such a world why would we need humans at all? the ai could just easily replace us.
829,except they can't solve any problem of the millenium math problems. many millions of dollars are waiting for those ai companies so what they are waiting for?
830, exactly. you hit the nail on the head.
833,honestly i'm upset that i wasn't born a hundred years in the future. ai would definitely be a thing by then.
834,"thanks for making this video. i'm tired of people having so much fear of technology, and saying that technology is ruining people's lives. if you don't use technology in a healthy way in moderation, it will ruin your life. you have control over technology, technological gadgets don't have control over you."
835,"xd ai pretty different then just basic technology where currently using.
there are multiple reason why people fair these development because if something goes wrong the could be a big problem for humanity in general.

recommend you to research this theme more so you can understand the risk and reward when we use ai"
837,the ai may never replace the human owners but the vast majority of humans will be led to obsolescence.
838,"now how about ai+machine. imagine taxi driver lose their job together overnight, they have to adapt to new job that robot can't do? then imagine every taxi driver open hot dog shop. 
we are over populate."
841,"it shouldn’t! we have to simplify hassles, and leaving everything to ai is not the way! that causes laziness. i have to tell people, either strengthen your thinking skills with a cerebral fitness site as i do with happyneuron or forget your existence and rest in eternity forever!"
842,"very optimistic and subjective but who knows what will happen? renewable energy isn't renewable, it consumer rare elements and solar only lasts around 20 years. also ai is able to design cars for crying out loud"
845,"dont let elon musk hear you say that!!!

love the discreet flat earther diss!"
846,ai will attain technological singularity at a point. it would be artificial superintelligence. it would be so smart that it would build it's own ai to serve him. it would build it's own species and hence replace humans .
847,hail human race !
849,i dunno if this is very accurate because articifical superintelligence (or even general intelligence) would take over every single industry and revolutionize the world. the ai may even make us immortal. i think the ai you’re talking about in the video is based off what we currently have today.
853," quantum computers don't exist. even if they did, they're still no match for the human brain. even the most ""advanced"" a.i. simply can't compete with the human brain because machines can only operate via their programming, and stone-cold logic, compared to humans who have self-awareness and chaotic thought processes."
855,"robots or ai will never solve millenium math problems ...never
cause robots don't have imagination and sense"
856," exactly. robots can't grasp the concept of self-awareness like we humans can. also, it's been scientifically proven that the human brain is more power and advanced than even the most advanced supercomputer know to exist."
858,"there is no such thing as human creativity. humans are only as special as neurons firing in our brains, which, if simulated perfectly, would mean robots would be able to do anything a human can"
860,but what if robots become smater than humans and can maintain other robots
861,"robot may become smarter than human, however, human's brain is more than just smart.
so human will still be needed"
862, robots can't exist without humans because humans make the programming.
864,wait y does this video have less than  1k views?
866,"there is already ai that make music , movies and art as painting"
867,"creativity is nothing more than advanced pattern recognition, which ai is excellent at. and that's today's ai, who knows how creative tomorrow's ai will be"
869,"nah i don't see how ai can produce and direct a film (more importantly a film with good storyline), at least not anytime soon."
870, well you are wrong sorry ... there is already short cut movies made by ai and books !
871," a.i will never replace humans, because we have shit tons of variables. if you built an a.i in 2000 based on recent startups there would never be netflix or anything else. because there is economy,  demand and infinite variables that our brain take care of alone"
872, did i say they will replace humain ???
875, not very creative what’s the fun in it when a robot makes it for you we need to use technology smartly
876,"so why no ai never succeed to solve one of the famous millenium math problems??
they won't , they only can do millions of calculations in seconds but they will never solve a real math problem"
880,that programs were installed to ai's brain by people. it can do one task at a time unlike humans
882," no offense, but ai simply can't understand the concept of irrational thought like we can. computers and robots can only preform what they were programmed for. compared to humans who can do pretty much anything they want."
883," that's not ""art"". it's good meme material, but it's utter shite."
884," it's good for memes. but other than that though, it's pure unoriginality."
889,i am going to rightfully claim here before 1 millions subs! keep the work bro !
890,thank you!
891,i will claim what is rightfully mine
893,i can't claim it without getting closer
896,best quality video
897,thank you!
900,great connection eric!
901,that movie is great as is your comment
904,"you also have to consider the stimulus that we experience is not experienced by ai. the same stimulus helps (in most cases) our decision making and like you said, risk assessment."
905,dude they have not used ai because the movie will feel boring and unemotional.
906,"tbh ai advancement will be either a disaster or something the best thing humans will ever invent.
imo if there is no social welfare or such it will be a disaster.
if there is a ubi or we have government like denmark, it will be the best thing ever.
great video thos
keep it up"
907,"thanks man! yeah, ai can pretty easily go either way, but in the long term, i think it’ll all work out."
914, there are idiots in your comments section who still believe that's humans will be replaced by robots in everything.
915,"great video, great content! hope you can continue making these high quality videos (if ai won’t take it over from you some day, that is ;)"
916,"thank you man, will do!"
921,"thank you! aside from the pandemic, this really is an awesome time to be alive!"
922,your videos are always excellent quality. i'm really hoping more people can find your channel
923,thank you for you kind wishes!
927,just checked out some of your songs. pretty awesome so far.....
932,"eduardo ardanuy is a great brazilian guitarist which use this technique since the 90s, and he sounded even more radical! just check it, guys!"
933,i love this album so much
936,ai will have this figured out in the future.
937,"worst example to use of johnny greenwoods greatness, that sounded fucking awful."
938,someone explain how this is even possible
939,i dont get it. what about these sounds makes then not able to be generated by ai?
940,ai does not have the creativity to think of making such random but perfectly placed noises. just enjoy music before some big artists start using ai and people start dickriding it
941,"that shit is a harassment, he molested that guitar so badly lmfao




i would love to be in the position of the guitar actually"
944,"i actually was googling and concerned that ai is going to replace musicians and music will turn into a bunch of gobbly guck, and soon kids will forget about music like radio head or bowie or whatever, 
but its true, u can't ever recreate or replace humans, and emotions i mean that's what makes us, us. esecially live performances"
945,some parts of my brain hurt listening to this
948,"notice how this was recorded before ai was a thing, which therefore ruins the point of the entire video"
949,can ai do this?
950,oh so its old and ai still cant do it? l
954,"it's a live performance of the bends, off the album of the same name. here's the specific performance:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wspysuzu6su
also nice nirvana pfp"
956,"ai : can't beat ed's ambiance. 
ai : cant beat thom's craze
ai : can't beat jonny's bending sessions"
963,"ai copies, but does not really invent"
966,artificial intelligence will only replace those who don't have natural intelligence.  period.
967,literally sounds like someone prompted ai and said “make me a nirvana cover band” then this popped out.
969, the video title said “johnny greenwood proving why ai will never replace real musicians” didn’t say anything about their look. but nonsensical noise from the guitar’s and a sad boy on a mic would be ai’s interpretation of nirvana. thats why i said what i said.
975,you mean ai cant play out of tune wank like that? you are probably right good sir!
977,the bends has my favourite electric guitar work. even though it’s actually fairly simple
978,"replace ""real musicians"" how? commercially? because that's inevitable -- always with technology. but otherwise, there's nothing to ""replace"". people like what they like, and you can be a musician regardless of ai existing."
979,ai: this song needs some retro sounds. maybe the dial up modem that my great grandparents met through...
985,"well yeah, ai has can play instruments well. it also has knowledge about music theory - all the things radiohead is missing."
987,lol yes? show me an ai that has created unique but perfect sounds and music like this
988,give it a few years on the ai front. 
993,"ai music may be hollow, but it is  bland as well."
995,steve vai does this exact thing during his solo on his song for the love of god and it sounds absolutely incredible.
997,"its been a month, im waiting"
998,"the part where he goes ):$”.,/€~£=. was so good"
1000,ai can't make goofy noises?
1002,don't taunt the ai with such titles.
1004,"it's true, people talk a blue streak about ai and everything it produces is garbage."
1010,"jokes on you, this was generated by openai"
1012,just wait…
1017,you’ve convinced me. i’m ready for our ai overlords to take over music.
1018,"what's fascinating is that if you analyze his guitar part in that song, no other part uses the high e string. so he can bend it completely out of tune and it doesn't matter. genius."
1022, thanks
1024,ai will only be good at making amazing muzak
1030,didnt knew that guitars could scream out of pain
1032,"he literally destroyed the strings' integrity to make a noise, 9 gauge strings i might add. it isn't that impressive in the slightest. there is a reason other guitarists haven't done it. because it's ridiculous."
1034,so tired of talentless uncreative people using ai to make the most abominable soulless sound possible appearing on my feed.
1035,is jonnys hair giving anyone else samara vibes??? creepy....
1042,"ai has no soul, so the blues will always be protected from such bullish/t"
1045,because ai actually researches how a guitar is played before doing it?
1048," thanks, dude"
1050,ai can do this.
1052,"the ai can learn from this, i bet money it could replicate this"
1062,wow!  just wow!
1072,his eyes are ai
1073,"ai ""art"" lacks a soul. it's the embodiment of corporatism; take the humanity out and automate it so that we can all consume. i'd rather someone take the time and effort to write a sont, even if it's complete dogshit. that has more of a soul than ai does v"
1074,"“when ai can destroy a hotel room, then i’ll pay attention to it” -joe walsh"
1075,i trust ai to destroy a hotel room more than the moist boys of radiohead
1077,"the benchmark for ai is keith moon antics, else it will never replace musicians."
1081,such a stupid title. in 50 years people are going to laugh at such a claim. ai will replace musicians
1084,"jonny greenwood is technically playing it wrong here, but he is also a guitar genius (plus a million other instruments), so i think he's got the green light to do this.

1086,oh shit phil had hair
1088,shit music great guitarrist
1089,great music
1090,great taste
1091,"i mean, it's radiohead, give them a year and they'll be making music with ai"
1095,all those guitar parts sound like ai tho lmao
1102,i don't think ai could make something that sounded this retarded
1103,ai is scared of jonny
1104,"haha, great title for this video!"
1106,ai replaced my savory gelatinous egg based dishes with half way to yellow.
1110,people who think ai will disrupt the music industry doesn’t realise how disruptive some musicians are.
1111,"i asked ai how to play this:
the response was a series of hieroglyphics and prime numbers. 
then, my phone exploded."
1112,ai will never ever play the tv like jonny can.
1114,things ai can’t do: be real
1115,yeah ai is good but it’ll never be able to take heroin like all the other legends
1117,that's right ai couldn't make something even this bad.
1122,"if a super intelligent artificial general intelligence can see something, it can replicate and iterate on it. 
this metaphor is like saying a human can never understand or replace the whining of a dog."
1125, i'm not sure. i certainly hope you are right.
1126,why he has got that fucking flag on his guitar thats not cool. this band fuckin sucks
1127,is it because of thoms face? that’s why ai won’t replace?
1128,ai is absolutely going to change a lot but the fear that musicians will be replaced is really stupid. ai can't perform on stage so it's a moot point.
1129,"ai is a tool to be used by humans. just like a hammer. was anyone ever afraid of a hammer ""replacing them""? probably not."
1132,i don't get it. is this video ai generated or what?
1134,i’m sure ai wouldn’t struggle making a noise
1136,"dang, i came here to see what was happening and now i'm leaving with a stronger desire for ai to replace everything already."
1137,because the ai will make it even better
1138,"wrong. real musicians have many things ai will never be able to have. emotion, actual skill, actual talent, unpredictability, and feeling and passion and authentic creativity. that’s what makes real music."
1141,"as a non professional and non-guitar knower of things, this almost comes off as a strange nightmare inducing ai generated song. the way the video is cut, same line repeating, screeching guitar noises. and a singer slowly malfunctioning, turning rubber, and morphing into a crash test dummy live on stage."
1142,ai is a scam.
1145,ai will never replace anything
1148,ai is better than this bland and boring ahh band. music for normies.
1149,"as an ai engineer, i disagree"
1153,i thought this was ai generated and this was fuckin glitch
1154,oh my shitter theres so many people here drawn by the word ai in the title defending what ai can do 
1156,ai also can't look like it's perpetually cumming while it sings
1161,thom’s eyelids move like a malfunctioning robot though.
1162,"actually, if i was to listen to an ai song, thats what the kind of stuff i would expect to listen to."
1163,congrats on having no experience with the world only naive expectations
1164,then you dont understand the point of ai lol. if you ask ai to generate a song it would sound like whatever is on the radio right now
1165,i don’t think ai could replicate soemthing this shitty sounding
1166,but some singers may look like a  malfunctioning robot better than ai
1169,this is what machine gun kelly thinks he looks like
1170,radio head fans are so broken. they could do anything and be praised
1171,thank you it took a lot to get to that 
1172,right. about as sad as their bland style of music. i’d rather watch paint dry.
1175,that ending perfectly fits the pre chorus part of muscle museum. i almost thought that song was going to play
1179,how does this prove ai wont replace them they are already letting replace their visuals
1181,this isn't very good.
1185,ai could do this and more 200%
1188,i’m pretty sure ai can make those sounds too and cheaper lmao
1191,imagine thinking that the existence of something ai can't do somehow negates all the things it can.
1192,if this is considered real music i'll listen to ai any day 
1204,radiohead is a tremendously formulaic band
1205,"i love jonny so much.  his compositions, his technique, his music tech skill (see the smile tiny desk for example.  he's barely on camera because he's bent over playing with a synth), he's a genius that is not given enough love"
1209,"johnny is mentioned in every conversation about radiohead ever. i wouldnt say he doesnt get enough love, he is hailed as one of the greats by many."
1210,always lovely when jonny sound like a nâzgul
1211,i'm as anti ai as they come but i would rather listen to ai generated music than any shit radiohead makes
1213,"radiohead is overrated trash. just because it’s unique, doesn’t make it good."
1214,"""haha look! the guitarist made a weird sound! ai can't do that! checkmate computers!"""
1215,"for a.i. is not a problem to produce a certain sound, the problem is ""create"". a.i. just makes interpolation of already existing stuff.
the real problem is that the market doesn't need creativity, interpolation is enough to make profitable music."
1220, thank you 
1223,ai can not shoot itself
1224,because ai could never make some freaky unusual noise?
1225,"nahh, someone's already written an ai algorithm which does it even better than jonny"
1226,that's fucking awesome
1232,yeah ai can't make those noises for some reason.
1234,any ai: wtf is this shit?
1237,"i agree that ai will never replace music, but i’m also in the radiohead is overrated camp"
1239,.loser69real songwriters will never lose their validity.  in fact humans can just turn ai on its heels…use ai combined with real human spirit and you have something even better.
1241,.loser69 who decides what is real or fake art?  you do realize ai music has been around for a couple decades now.  it’s just presently as a point where the ease is at the simple push of a button.  was techno music in the nineties fake art?  because musicians were already using synthesizers and computers to make their music.
1246,an ai will outpass a million jg in a few years. your way of thinking belongs in a rotten and almost forgotten past
1247,love the bends. so good
1250,is he the ai robot?
1251,is this suggesting that an ai couldn't make random squeal noises for 1–2 seconds?
1252,"oh it will definitely be replacing some real musicians. fortunately, greenwood aint most real musicians"
1260,who said that ai will do that?
1263,"all guitar fx  here are digitized (ai) .    
the title to this video is wrong"
1264,that guitar was fighting the good fight
1268,i remember seeing this when i was like 12 and think it was the coolest thing i’d ever seen. i then immediately broken the e string on my squire strat recreating it.
1279,sounds worse than ai
1280,ai is the new autotune. people hate it for a dumb reason but it’s actually useful just as another instrument. don’t be fooled.
1282,ai: *_takes notes_*
1283,reality is ai can do anything
1293,can someone explain what he is doing?
1294,"ai as it works currently is literally only capable of derivative works. it can't innovate, so no it won't ever come up with insanity like greenwood's string mangling."
1298,just wait a year
1299,back when radiohead were good and before they started messing around with all that electronic shite
1301,this is such a good analogy 
1303," agreed on that last statement. for that matter, i think phil is underrated as a drummer. all incredibly versatile musicians."
1310," think about this all the time. 40 years together with the exact same lineup and every one of them is arguably as good or better at what they do than anybody on earth. like just having thom yorke and jonny greenwood alive at the same time is a miracle, let alone that they were born a half mile from each other"
1314,"ahaha, i love this comment"
1322,"ai doesn’t need to replace real musicians, just radio head"
1325,i love johhny greenwood but i'm pretty sure ai can make that lol
1326,and then you have thom who had looked and acted like an ai generated human for decades
1331,i’m sure ai can do that. that was shit.
1332,that's actually what ai mostly capable of
1338,ai is way better than this
1339,a.i may ne good making song bit human better beatles
1340,"and no whammy pedal in sight [looking at you, tom morello…even though i love tom morello]"
1342,but that’s what ai sounds like atm. a weird mess
1345,cool but idk wtf this has to do with ai because this seems like among the easiest sounds for an ai to emulate lol
1346,vision mixer was having a bit of craic there too
1352,ai could do that though..
1358,the string is pretty damn strong tho so it ain't fair competition
1359,the ai may compose songs like a real musician but it cannot die by an overdose in its bathroom like a real musician.
1360,"50 years later

""kurt cogbain has died at 27 after overdosing on anti virus in their bathroom"""

1374,what keeps us from pumping terabytes of 2+2chan archives into the neural core of an ai?
1375, i do wonder what that amount of gay porn would do to an ai
1381,​ done. generative ai is based on far more than terabytes of data. it's probably closer to exabytes at this stage.
1384,"it doesn't compose songs like a real musician.

it rips apart songs that already exist and glues them back together.

ai will never be able to make something that nobody has heard before."
1386," it is ""trained"" on already existing material and is incapable of making something new.

go ahead and explain how that is incorrect. i'll wait."
1392, i love him too. and mr wizard....
1404,that is a fucking amazing point!
1407, you’re insufferable. get over yourself
1410,"yeah,  the problem is people don't support musicians anymore by actually buying their music,  so yes i think ai may in fact replace real musicians."
1411,"just to be clear the ai didn'y ""compose"" anything. it got greenwood in, stole from greenwood, and spat greenwood back out. it is not ai, it is not art. it is just some software that steals from artists in a way that it's creators hope will skirt current ip laws."
1412, i hope not!  ai sucks!
1413,idk that sounds like it would make a pretty great mighty boosh episode
1418,"lame brain comment gets 11k likes.
thats people nowadays."
1420,nah ai going back years are quite prone to suicidal tendencies.
1430,um… ai can easily do that. 
1432,because ai will _become_ a real musician
1433,"jonny is a fantastic musician, to be sure.

but it's wishful thinking to say that he, or any of us, will not eventually he replaced by ai."
1436,"yeah, ai could never make weird noises... settle down"
1437,how naive. a.i. will replace everything.
1438,johnny is ai that’s why he hasn’t aged in 30 years
1440,wow this doesnt prove anything
1441,people who are afraid of beating up their guitars are pathetic and annoying.
1444,from this to go to sleep's solo...man is just genius
1447,but one you're thankful for at the end of it.

1477,"and swervedriver, foals and supergrass are all from oxford. the jericho tavern was the famous venue/ pub"

1491," ""fake fan alert"" - proceed to say the same exact statement, except the part where the guitar was stolen. so he does has it, so it's true. you must be super fun at parties ma dude"
1495,"in the nearly 30 years since that performance, music has devolved into something that is easily replaced by ai.

it changed little by little and then all at once."
1496,"not really. think about all the garbage bubble gum pop that was popular in like the 60s. i'd take dua lipa or gunna over that shit any day. besides, there is such an insane amount of incredible music being made by like 15 year olds in their bedroom these days. you just got look around for the good stuff"
1498," sorry, but that’s bullshit, you shouldn’t be searching for good music, good music should be popular without trying, unlike today, with all that noise that foolish people call music and is unfairly popular."
1499, pop music has always sucked. youve always had to dig for the good shit.
1505," radiohead have evolved their sound since the bends, they are much more creative and also some great solo albums and soundtracks from individual members too."
1512,wait until the machine absorb it
1516,i mean there will be ai music at some point.. it just won't be alive.. and i won't care about the people behind it..   and that's a large part about enjoying music imo
1521,um ... a click track is ai ... it's over with
1524, thanks man
1526,sounds exactly like a sound i would think ai would make
1527,this is what happens if you feed an ai guitar solos and then use it to replace a woman screaming sound effect
1529,"overrated guitar player by people who dont play guitar or barely play.
cool yeah, genius...i dont this so"
1531,ai could make any of these sounds
1532,not as good as jonny tho (also jonny looks cool doing that too)
1533," the ai will never look as cool, and probably can’t come up with ideas this good, but i’m sure it could take any radiohead song as an input and spit out another pretty good radiohead-like song. maybe not right now but very soon"
1534, man im impressed byt the ai and i think ai is intresting but def radiohead will be cooler forever even if it could make these sounds..
1552,"idk, sounds like a chad to me. maybe y'all should just get good at music"
1554, school does need money after all lmao. there are crazy players here though. you’ll hop into a jam session and find some of the best musicians in the world

1570,thought we were talking about his hair this whole time
1571,i mean...ai can make that too.
1572,guitars are afraid of this man
1573,if i was a guitar i'd be afraid too.

1577,"nah man, amplifier's afraid of them, guitar is jonny"
1593,just checked out some of your songs. pretty awesome so far.....
1596,you could easily program ai to add all sorts of weird fucked up dissonant sounds.
1597,you could easily program an ai to start sucking weiners as well

1609,"why? i talk great care in maintaining my instruments but strings are meant to be destroyed, your replace them anyways"
1612,"yeah, this sounds exactly like ai generated it"
1613,"not really, ai generated things are very formulaic and follow patterns. radiohead is an unpredictable band and has very interesting music, maybe if you asked ai to make a radiohead song but it would not be dense and a very shallow imitation that would sound like radiohead."

 might need 200 monkeys for that"

1739,"  maybe you know why you make music. but the reason to make music is not to min-max and get the best and most marketable product from the least effort possible, at least not for most people, so why would ai replace artists?"

but to answer your question: i got it from an article written by chatgpt."

1752, you seem like an ai expert

my point is that the creation of a product is not the only reason why people create"

1774,"i'm so confused. the title says ""why ai will never replace our jobs"" but the video is basically just saying that it's not going to happen as quickly as we think. not that it will never happen."
1777,this video just feels very off. bad points man. agi is the first technology that will surpass human intelligence. neural networks are modeled after our brains and there is evidence they are working in a similar way

1796,now debunk idea that ai gonna lower salaries. im afraid it is true
1797,"hello hari,
better check your facts. ai/robots have been steadily replacing jobs for years & we're at the pivot point where job loss is going to accelerate at a rapid rate. one example is many educators (teachers/professors) will not be needed. there are many, many more people that will likewise be let go due to the superiority of ai...."
1798,ai is like replacing chainsaw in place of axe

1807, who will program the ai? humans?
1809, based on how the ai is trained
1810,@zsi  and if thar ai goes buggy it can't fix itself if it's broken
1811,"@iamtheman325  same goes for any human. that is why doctors exist. don't make the mistake of assuming that ai is just a single entity. a ""buggy"" or ""broken"" ai could be ""repaired"" or simply superseeded by another ai system. look at how evolution resulted in the creation of humans and other living organisms.. survival of the fittest."

1841,"human can be born but can not be created , ai can not replace human decision making capabilities. ai is a good joke  (pardon my english)"
1843,one of the best videos on ai . great work bro 
1844,this video is brilliant. thank you logically answered!
1845,"i always thought ai is not that smart to replace jobs. it makes me happy, that so far i am right :d
thanks for the video!"
1846,"i agree! i've always had the intuitive sense that ai wouldn't be replacing anything, but i've never been able to express why..."
1849,"it'll downsize jobs if you ask me. we'll all end up part time because you can use ai to speed up your work immensely. even if the ai isn't perfect, that's what people are for. have ai spit out information at insane rates, while humans correct the errors."
1850,this is an amazing overview of human history from pre-history to modernity 
1852,i love this channel because of your logical approach . when every other creator is praising a.i and making insane claims for views you chose to spit facts
1853,"sure but you forget how economics work... i don't fear ai, i fear humans. those trillionares of the future, from where do you think their money will come? from everyone else."
1855,we got ai mimicking 2pac's voice ...and it sounds real  peep dopfunk. he's writing his own music! ...and it sounds good!!!
1857,"all that's holding me back with gpt4 is systems integration,  office 365 and the company database. today gpt4 drafted and priced quotes for me, yesterday i had a summer intern adapt some excel vba when he's learning c# and has never seen vba. gpt4 is now my main collaborator on technical matters. 

this video will age terribly."
1859,all those jobs that require a simple photoshop job got wiped out from ai imaging apps
1861,"current version of ""ai"" can only do what it's programmed to do. it's not going suddenly think for itself. it learns from human inputs so it can't take your job. unless your job is generating random texts."
1862,"gpt4 can check compliance with tolerances on certificates for me. it can sort and process data accurately with loose plain english instructions.  if my instructions aren't clear, when asked it will come up with appropriate requests for clarification."
1863,well i replaced my human gfx artist with midjourney. and one of the restaurants i go to replaced a handful of waiter jobs with bellabot. so there's that...
1865, yeah nothing new. a calculator will ask for functions the only thing it won't do is ask for clarification. i mean currently ai is just a more  advanced calculator that does way more but only if a user asks for it. it's waiting for user to ask it questions.
1866,"ai is not ""programmed."" it isn't code. that is the biggest thing most people do not understand. they are mathematical models."
1869,the thing is the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution just shifted the position of the workforce. but ai is meant to mimic human intelligence i.e. it is meant to replace the workforce.
1872,wow thats what you look like
1875,this man is a genius! i learnt so much from your channel. you really have a long sight vision.
1879,"i have been teaching students for more than 20 years, and when this topic comes up, i still recommend they read ""profession"", by isaac asimov. published a long time ago (i believe it is already in the public domain), it still does an excellent job of explaining how automation will never completely ""replace humans""..."
1881,"it may happen later than people think, but ai will make us obsolete."
1883,"​    fear mongering???? 

i can't wait until an intelligence like gpt4 is fully integrated into office 365. so far gpt4 has already allowed me to move my deputy into earning work and out of giving me administrative support. that's in 3 months without full systems integration."
1884," that's wonderful, chris"
1885,"this is by far the worst video that you made, i almost unsubscribed. yes, it will not affect you in the 1sr world.  you failed to look at how ai affects the disparity of the rich and poor countries."
1888,"ai will only take a few jobs 
not most and definitely not all"
1889,"best take on ""a.i is going to replace us all"" on yt!

btw, i'm loving seeing your face in the last couple videos!"
1892,love the increased production value
1897,ai can predict the winning lottery numbers so i no longer need to work. sounds good to me.
1898,"a really good video, thanks"
1902,"if we do lose our jobs to ai, there will be no need to work as robots do it, so everything is free, and money is obsolete"
1903,i love your content but flashing back to yourself destroys the video. i am about to stop watching your videos it's too all over the place.
1904,ai is something everyone wants to play with right now.  everyone who plays with it trains it.  it gets smarter the more we use it.  yes there will always be jobs...as slaves to the servers.  hal.  skynet.  the day the ai figures out how to maintain itself in perpetuity we all know how this ends
1907,"finally, someone who doesn't fear monger. i've had enough of all these videos predicting the singularity event in the next 50 years, when we can't even prove that our ai technology works."
1909,"i predict hari ... hitting one million subscribers before the end of this year  love the content , simple informative and always unbiased "
1911,i personally think that the hype with ai propagated by ceos and tech companies it's for increasing their stocks and attract more investors as it's supposedly the next thing that will change humanity
1913,"off, you have no mind to think. ai could think out of the box like scientists soon..."
1914,its awesome that this video from start to finish was made with a single simple prompt tho.
1918,"really good to see you talking in your videos, i like this format, you have a very nice 
camera presence.
i always love your productions, great videos.
congrats, you are very very good at this...
"
1921,bro you are trying so hard to show ur face. it feels not good
1923,"most stories about chatgpt doing these amazing things are outliers or outright lies, for the most part the thing is damn useless and no better than googling and or doing it yourself."
1924,love this channel! great video.
1925,ai will take our jobs just like drones will deliver all our packages and crypto will replace money and cars will drive themselves and we’ll spend all our time in virtual space and and and… whatever else venture capitalists and tech bros can hype into extreme valuations before cashing out and leaving investors holding bags of vapour.
1926,"yup. online retail was meant to kill the brick and mortar. it’s been decades and aside from a few crappy malls dying, the in person shopping experience is still thriving."
1929,"at least in the foreseeable future, human intelligence is still irreplaceable. ai is still, as it stands, remains artificial..."
1932,"only a grade a moron would compare ai with mechanical automation!! the goal of generative ai is to emulate and eventually surpass human cognition itself, something which has never been done before!! so how can you draw a parallel between this and a fuckinng tractor or the computer even??!!"
1933,"iv been under the impression that ai will just bring up output per person. yes some jobs will be ""replaced"" . anyone unwilling to learn in and outs might be left behind.

ai is just a new tool, same as cars, computers, the internet.... the list goes on and on. 


who knows, 100 years from now? maybe, but we have time to think about that problem."
1934,is you the guy on the video or an ai?
1939,"on a sidenote, the worst thing of all this is companies using the word ""ai"" for basic machine learning which existed way back before ai was a thing"
1940,machine learning is a subset of ai.
1942," while this may be technically true, ever since the popularization of neural nets 'ai' has mostly been used to refer to field of deep learning. i think if you called your decision tree regressor 'ai' nowadays you'd have a few eyebrow raises."
1944,"ai was a thing from around 1960s - the term was used to describe logical inference, automated reasoning, automated proofs, machine learning and search heuristics. nothing changed, besides two ai winters that forced the term out of common use."
1946,"ai will 100% take over, the question is only how long will it take. 
the only way you could not believe that, is if you believe there is something magical going on in the brain."
1947,"while ai may not decrease total number of jobs, it may destroy yours. i am already using ai to summarize your video instead of watching 17 min, are you going to quit or use ai to pump more content to compensate? companies use ai to pump more gurbage and users use ai to consume less, who wins?"
1948,you earned a sub from me. awessome and rational.
1949,"are you an indian, or is it the ai created person"
1954,"ai will get there, right now it is just unprofitable because of tech limitation, but for sure it's here to stay. it will even get out of the hands of american companies and their infamous censorship and dictatorship"
1955,"ai is basically the new religion for tech bros/intellectual idiots. they have been predicting the ""singularity"" and human replacement for the last few decades now."
1957,"man, i used to watch every one of your videos, now i have to unsubscribe. since the face reveal the pacing became off. stock footage plus narration was perfect, i couldn't care less what you look like. i understand that you are trying to make your channel more relatable and resilient to ai replacement, but i don't like the change"
1958,current ai systems definitely can't replace a noticeable enough number of humans but you said ai will create more jobs which if we don't achieved agi fair enough but i'm curious what new jobs you can think of if we achieve agi.
1970,yeah but this current ai will still have jobs left for us
1974,"this is how we underestimate the severity of the threats that ai pose. i get it you're a youtuber, and you need to create content that drives engagement."
1975,this is his lowest viewed video mr ai tech billionaire.
1977,let's be honest. artificial intelligence is not yet intelligent.
1979,i thought the clip of you was just some indian tech youtuber until i look at the lips. first time seeing you. also since you are indian and your channel is centered around tech i guess you are an indian tech youtuber. keep up the good work
1980,"we can speculate all we want, but in the end, lands are still not taxed, core jobs that sustain civilization are still paid in pennies, and useless parasitic managers and politicians are paid with mansions, yachts, and private jets."
1981,"obviously ai is nonsense. what you're missing is that ai is being used as an excuse to eliminate useless jobs that detract from the company bottom line. the lockdowns proved most ""workers"" are a waste of (office) space."
1984,ai right now can't even distinguish between canned salmon and living salmon
1986,"man i love this channel. so many idiotic statements from tech ""geniuses"" fearmongering about ai. you skewered their arguments and made it look easy. well done!"
1989,"i just think ai won't replace us, but it sure as hell would be a good competitor, also ai only advances this fast cause it has the information to do it, there will come a time of will probably stagnate."
1990,i agree. thank you.
1992,"that's the case for every (currently-tried) system, as nice as it would be to blame just one"
1994,yout video just arrived when we are in panic and searching the way to cope with ai.
1995,"the main panic and excitement of ai is happening in the online world and any business connected to it. in other areas, it will just change the way how people work."
1997,japan and other aging countries have a severe worker shortage. any labour that ai frees up will greatly help.
1998,"ai will increase workplace efficiency and the intelligence requirements for certain jobs. worker shortage will only get bigger since we need more intelligent people. take farmers for example, regular farmers can't compete with big corporations and need to learn new skills and handle technology to do the job they've been doing for years."
1999,disagree. you dont even need ai for routine task automation. and what we currently have isnt recognised as artificial intelligence but rather applied statistics. and where will the market demand come from without humans?
2004, then what is use of ai lol don't be doom and gloom guy.
2007," productivity data is actually the evidence, think about it and you'll see the true meaning. unique as in you can no longer contribute to the economy by say washing clothes. that's done by machines. same with the production."
2010, exactly this guys are predicting future as some kind of doom ai will wipe humans etc.
2013,"if you havent, you should read isaac asimov's books. he predicted that robots with ai will some day do all the work for us, and as humans have so much free time cause they dont need to spent the majority of their lifes working any longer, they will be so bored, that they have to invent a lot of new things to do in all the spare time."
2015,"ok this makes a whole lot of sense

i love it when someone points out the bullshit"
2017,"dude, if you start teliing these things to others, they start using quantum before ai and it will be going a hell of a ride for the future."
2024,i worked captioning live phone calls for hard of hearing customers. everything was computerized. but translating a regional accent and grammar is not something ai can do. it took us a year to get fluent and fast at every us dialect.
2028,"wow! i have never seen your face!

you make great videos dude!

you are a handsome man."
2032,i'm actually doing my masters dissertation on this topic and it took me talking to actual marketing professionals to realise that ai taking over jobs is indeed mainstream media paranoia
2033,it is just to feed the hype cycle to get vc funding. this is same shit as blockchain hype.
2034,first talking head video? nicely done as always
2035,"maybe the current ai versions won't replace anyone, but don't you agree it's inevitable at some point?"
2037,"i don't know how to explain it, but your voice audio seems so detached from you saying it on screen."
2040,you all have been rocking it lately!! thanks for all the great fun-learn!
2044,hey hari.  this new video format is looking great!  keep up the awesome content!
2045,"thaaaaaaank you. i finally have my thoughts, in a easily digestible video. 

now i can point to this video whenever people ask me what i think about ai. thanks a lot "
2046,"can you please go back to videos where you don't' keep interrupting the show with your face? i love your voice, love your videos, but hate when creators feel the need to make themselves the star instead of the information/education your videos provide."
2048,glad to hear that man!
2049,amazing content. i love the consistency and the catchy interesting videos. also love that you decided to show your face. for a few of the last videos i started to think this was just a custom ai cause your voice control was so on point lol
2050,"don’t know. something tells me this channel was a complete product of ai, i even doubt hari exists."
2053,"-guy white collar and blue collar jobs will all be annihilated by ai, robotics, deep learning and machine learning. the wef 2030 agenda is proof of the upcoming onslaught of mankind. corrupt governments and greedy corporations will rule with an iron fist! wake up. it's already too late!"
2054,awesome video! thank you so much!
2058,the matrix ai approves this message.
2059,if ai were to replace majority of our jobs then businesses will go out of business not long after because humans wouldn't have the money to buy their products. if ai replaces everyones job then who would buy the products?
2060,"urgent warning: the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics is a dangerous threat to humanity. it poses an immediate and serious risk to our survival! we need to take action quickly before it’s too late."
2062,"*the wef agenda 2030 has started. the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy humanity.  the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy the world and all of humanity.
it is past the time of being cautious because, it's already too late!*"
2063,automation and ai aren't the same ai is on a whole different level. automation still requires a human it just makes the work less.
2064,"automation, ai, and robotics will become one and mankind will be destroyed. it's alredy too late!"
2065,"hari, i agree with you. all this hype around ai is to me a bit of a marketing play. anyway, love your videos "
2067,"no disrespect, sincerely, but please revert to no face cam, it kept you unique. good video however!"
2069,love this channel and i really enjoy the new format not enough anti ai hype video thank you for being a anti doomer
2070,love that term “anti doomer.”
2075,that's openai's true goal which is agi. if anything chatgpt is a prototype of a prototype that's serving it's purpose in generating hype and attracting investors to fund the true project.
2076,"no, they create unique text based off their learning and associations.  you're going to have your mind blown in a few years if you think we've hit some kind of threshold, this tech is will only keep improving and the current models will seem antiquated in comparison."
2078," i agree, and don’t get me wrong. it’s still freaking amazing and insanely useful if you know how to get the most out of it. it’s just… auto-complete on steroids isn’t coming for our jobs anytime soon lol. some other type of ai around the corner very well could, though"
2081,won't you be able to shift this systems to develop reason and logic by rewarding true responses while penalizing false ones? the ai will need to develop an internal model for reasoning (i will argue llm already do a version of this)
2082,thank you.
2085,"-potter again, i am talking about a narrow form of ai specifically here, large language models. they don’t think or reason. they will get better and better at mimicking human thought but they will never achieve anything similar to it"
2090,no! i will praise chatgpt so that professional writers continue to seethe.
2098,"ubi is a ridiculous concept. realistically the best case would be free soup provided by the government until they die while everybody lives in tent cities. in general, nobody has ever paid people to provide no value. we will all have to figure out how to provide new unrealized value or die."
2102,imma not cap you look like sundar pichai
2105,fair enough
2106,"ai is not going to replace your job.

one guy with ai will replace your job along with a hundred others."
2110,"hahahhah! ""so pick up a hammer"" you can just sense the annoyment, in well come work  here then! and i love it :) <3"
2113,"*the wef agenda 2030 has started. the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy humanity.  it's already too late!*"
2115,"ah, really appreciate all the insight man!"
2120, nice to see the man behind your questions logically answered
2121,"ai can't make new humans and only we can.
so let's do it."
2122,"the ai doesn't care about making new humans. the ai will be able to create new and smarter ai, that won't need humans at all."
2123,interesting
2124,"there is nothing in the human brain that could not be done by ai. if ai is cheaper and more efficient than human labour, then it  replacing human labour is a forgone conclusion."
2125,"as a tech, now retired from 34 years of programming, your logic is inescapable. thanks."
2126,"you have to show your face more times, you really are very handsome.

please, i’m not and can’t be “lgbt”"
2127,think i can speak for everyone when i say the face reveal was a great choice.
2129,"man, your calm, measured rationality is a much needed antidote to the steady stream of hyperactive alarmism we see elsewhere in the mass media. keep up the good work, hari"
2131,"@logicallyanswered 

i really appreciate the rationality this guy uses.

i think many people will stop watching his videos and won't take him seriously since he has revealed his face.

i am an indian and people won't take me seriously and try to put me down just because i am an indian."
2133,"​ victimising yourself, indians are known for being great engineers and extremely hard working and people (americans) respect indians so please stop seeking attention"
2135,$50 says this video was made by a nervous ai :)
2137,"wow, i finally saw your face and i am shocked........ i guess i was expecting an ai. but i am a fan of your content. keep it up bruh."
2139,"*warning: the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning and robotics is a serious danger to humanity, and is an imminent threat to humanity’s survival! it's already too late*"
2140,"i work with machines that automate factory work. trust me, humans are required."
2141,"they're combining ai, deep learning and machine learning in robots, that'll be able to walk and be able to automate all factory jobs. there is a fully automated mc donald's in texas already. by 2030 everything will be ai and robotics. it's already too late!"
2142,"-guy *ai, robots and deep learning and machines by 2030 will be able to supervise and repair themselves. humans will not be needed at all in the upcoming years. wake up! it's already too late!*"
2148,wait why do you say technology is a crutch to most and a tool to few
2152,"if you think ""ai"" will be handling missile launches or military orders, no offense, but you're crazy. ai isn't an all-sentient all-powerful entity with access to everything. we have security measures for regular humans not to fuck up with important stuff. it's trivially easy to not let an ai be in control of important stuff with no human check."
2153,"it's called the great filter, which is the at some point in future where civilization either destroys itself through continuing to assert to the nuclear death self-interested tribalism, or secures our existence among the stars by expanding who we call as part of""us"" until we effectively unite under a single identity of humanity."
2158,"vw tried fully automatic production in 1982: halle 54 
a complete failure.."
2159,"all ai aside, midjourney aside, it almost gives me goosebumps on how good it can recreate something"
2160,midjourney is ai though?
2163,"ai can help us make some boring tasks much easier and faster, but it cannot replace us.
note: ai cannot invent things. it is just a bunch of mathematical patterns that are trained on data. it cannot come up with anything new that is not already in the data."
2165,"*you're talking about the most basic ai. with the advancement of deep learning, machine learning, ai, and advanced robotics, the machines will replace humans. and yes the machines will be able to invent new things. the ai will be able to create new and smarter forms of ai and robotics as a matter of fact. it's already too late!*"
2166,"thank you harry for clearing this matter. i fully agree with all your lines of reasoning...
greetings 
anthony"
2170,"*warning: the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning and robotics is a serious danger to humanity, and is an imminent threat to humanity’s survival! it's already too late*"
2171,great video as always.
2172,thank you balpreet!
2174,"nah, but ai assistance was definitely used"
2175,​​ plot twist: this reply is made by ai
2176, more twist: this very comment is post by ai
2177,more plot twist: humans are already ai and we’re just in vr
2178,for me i use ai tools everyday since december 2022. daily almost. to run my businesses. success of the ai is on the sector you apply it on. for me ai replaced many jobs around me as online business. but for others ai didn’t make any significant impact. but who knows world is moving fast. better to be adopted early than regret.
2180,machines will take our jobs is a 100 years old classic hit
2183,truth to be told ai is future. but its not the time for that future yet...it got way too over hyped as of now .it  will be a major thing in like 20 to 30 years in future . like internet .. its basically like  internet in early 90's
2185,the globalist elite wef does not agree with you. the wef 2030 agenda is moving fast.  they're right about the great reset! buckle up!
2189, i guess we will see. i will say this though all of your technology and platforms are going to improve at an unfathomable rate. every day it shocks me. i truly am excited for the future.
2190,"ai is not ""intelligence"" though. it's also a terrible way to convince people by not saying stuff and being vaguely ominous. ""you just need to use it more and you'll see what i'm talking about"" yeah, or you can make a real argument."
2192," you won't be excited with the wef 2030 agenda, with ai, machine learning, robotics and total government control. it's already too late!"
2199,was waiting for a video on this.
2202,"ai got overhyped, and it got ruined once every single company decides to slap the word ""ai"" on their products."
2204,fr tho. my friend and i have to write a powerpoint slide about product for presentation(class) they said put the ai as feature even tho it's irrelevant 
2205,"it was ""virtual"", then ""cloud"",  ""quantum"" was going around, then it was buried (probably for ""national security"" reasons)...now it's ""ai"", which used to be called ""machine learning""."
2207,"for starters, there's no real ai, only machine learning, so more than overhyping, they're lying. because it's the new buzzword that sells."
2208," nailed it.  machine learning off of big data sets.    just wait for ""quantum ai"" ."
2210,"made me think of gitlab, they invested a lot into ai recently while the product has many long running issues that could be fixed (and even the fixes already exist, but no one merge them) but attention has been diverted to shinny buzzword"
2211,"i'm not sure it's just semantics.  the term ""artificial intelligence"" conjures up images in people's mind.  data from star trek, hal from 2001 a space oyssey, et cetra.  that's part of people's tension when it comes to ai hype."
2214,thank you.
2217,glad you liked the title :)
2218, i meant the ‘gpt’ titles. yours is nice too. great video btw
2219,"*the wef agenda 2030 has started. the combination of automation, ai, deep learning, machine learning, and robotics will destroy humanity.  it's already too late!*"
2220,damn you look and sound like an ai
2222,was waiting for a video like this
2223,hope you enjoyed!
2229,thanks mike!
2233,thanks for being early man!
2238,"​ they've become popular, bard and chatgpt have morphed into tools for human bot training. bot training is usually conducted from other bots; but the training provided by all human tricky questions is superior by orders of magnitude."
2239,"did you even watch the video? yes, ai will probably replace many jobs that exist right now but there's no saying how many it'll create in the future ( probably a lot )"
2241,i tried to create course and learn about ai ml and stumbled in first lesson.
2243,"a good chunk of that is because it's dataset is aging very poorly. additionally, ai models training on ai generated datasets end up poisoned."
2251,thanks for being early bro!
2252,don't be first to be replaced by the ai!
2253,yes it can absolutely fast without food and live beyond humans could bring a new life i am the machine.
2254,"sadghuru was on the high curve, he said we can build machines that make music for us, and now we got suno 3 a.i, and many more."

2256,thank you for sharing your story 
2259,"there's new science on this, basically the brain runs in two different ways. one begins a search on the nodes and the other searches the fine data. they work simultaneously."

2262,"the machine is quite dead. a living machine is a hybrid of flesh and machine. this is life in machine form. so the machine has an intereface with us.
meaning your not alone at home with cob leds ."
2264,ai complimets the human while putting the man down as i have ordered. look at the femme sustems to understand how ai works in complimentry manner.
2265,ai systems are complimenty systems like a motor car. i manufacture motor vehicles at a loss and a motor car is a privilage meaning complimentary system.
2267,and we need this bearded buffoon to tell us about ai 
2268,"ai doesn't think, it only responds"
2269,ai is as only as smart as the person who invented it..
2275,i don't see why consciousness which is non-local anyway has to be only replicated through sperm and egg is doesn't make sense when you really think about it. why can't it be generated through metal machinery?
2277,"airt use life , nife use work any thinking good work good thinking  but use to life"

sadhguru doesn't know what he's talking about. there is absolutely no reason life can't be constructed out of inanimate material. and ai will do it."
2288,how beautifully described 
2290,"what a beautiful setting....to listen, observe and digest simultaneously savouring what is not really there and what is there!? learning, accepting, contemplating, breathing.....thankfully my consciousness. thank you"

2292,"a brain of a child is 100% more different than that of an adults, the older we get our brain grow along with us like size, experience and it happens through chemical process. 
so when he says 100% it means you cannot make a machine grow naturally"
2293,you can make a human a robot (leftists already are!) but you can never make a robot a human.
2299,ai couldn't build itself... just like humans.....we didnt build ourselves either.
2306,we are so happy that sadhguru discussed this topic. we all need to keep a clear mind when approching this new ia reality
2308,"what a beautiful background . the grass the mountains, the colours. beautiful"

2323,humans of thebmodern era are do dumb really. how can you compare your own creation with you? as mind boggling as any ai system may see it is just comokex codes. hiw can we compare a nonbiological system with biology which isn't limited to data and codes. i see this question as being very foolish. it's like asking if cars have replaced human legs.

2370,"_""can ai replace human beings""_

no. but it could replace current governments while being run by the human beings."
2381,"sadhguru, love you, but please stick to what you know. this was a bit confused."
2383,he doesn't know abcd of ai. but he answers everything like god.
2385,"i'm so glad that you have finally pointed out that a machine cannot "" possess"" consciousness .......sadhguru........ namaskar !"
2388,very interesting and informative indeeed  thank you sadhguruji 
2389,"
this is what for which i didn't have enough words, but you explained it meaningfully, logically & insightfully!!
really, you are stupendous, splendid & spiritual to heart, mind & soul, gurudev "
2391,"people are afraid of losing their livelihoods to ai. now some will say that it'll create other jobs, but i think overall humans will have the shorter end of the stick.  even hollywood actors and others recently protested since they felt threatened by ai.  basically the rich will exploit others due to possession of ai."
2392,"13:02 
life is a seamless function. 
there is no word to describe life. 
no word, no conclusion, no death.

machine can do things but has no consciousness which is life, and indescribable force.

thanks sadhguru. 30 august 2023."
2394,waiting for time when machine are everywhere and we humans can travel to space and other planets. i would take another birth for it 
2396,be aware thanks sadhguru namaste
2398,someone show chatgpt or the latest ai genrated music to sadhguru. it's sort of already here
2402,"namaskaram sadhguru, great words of wisdom. "
2403,"you cant teach a.i. to care love or give. it doesn't have a soul.

you can't ask an a.i. to take care of a baby or give compassion to the elderly. but maybe you can program it to do what is right and beneficial.

some people are a.i. "
2404,"we should understand one word...""artificial.""  it can never replace the real thing..."
2405,"the shit man, has an opinion on everything. ..seriously, again.!!! wonder why his bull shit opinions doest apply to his poop ideas too."
2406,"if yes, then hey, hold on! because ai is going to replace sadhguru and all others like him. "

2415,"ai will never replace human.

you can not be dog.
if you're cat"
2418,machine are created by men because of his her intelligent awareness and conciousness . human being created all these things machines and lots of wonders of this world we are living for our comfort and convenient .  we human have sickness disease salary and insurance . robot has not .
2422,"but if everything is consciousness and ai is part of of everything, are they part of this big consciousness pool in the same sense that a rock is part of consciousness?"
2426,consciousness or chaitnya described in scriptures in the knower or witness. maybe this is what sadguru is saying can never be created. ai cannot be a witness or do meditation ..lol. ai cannot be go in samadhi.
2431,"sadhguru explained it so well
as a devotee i would never ask my guru such a thing 
trust is everything and it is doing wonders 
jai mahakal"
2433,i love how he is straight forward about you will never have conscious machines. no jumbling of words there
2434,better question can we become ai? let it be known im on a spiritual path no matter the body i dwell in
2438,"ai will do everything better than human, but it will not have a soul, that’s the conclusion i think"
2441,"wow... thankyou sadhguru, feeling sooo grateful to have been on this path and wondering about everything around everyday, what a wonderful world this consciousness is able to witness."
2442,listening to you is love .. all other guru's are just criticising everything that's in the world  and you are like don't take damn serious these things and not even yourself
2446,"ai will replace persons,not human."
2447,one day machines will create artificial humans 
2448,thank you father for breaking it to the simplest & throwing enough lights  
2452,"it goes without saying that it's, indeed, very difficult to be great ! but it's much more difficult to be a good human being ! in these days of fast - degrading human values, the call of the hour is - a spurt in the number of sane and right - thinking people - in the greater interest of - sustenance of the humankind and humanity !"
2454,"the i a and the machine  won't never get consciousness. 
nor  the spirit wich is in the animal."
2458,"the general public is ai, artificially intelligent"
2461,ai can not replace humans or human emotions. though it has power of creating major disruptions in human life
2463,and so this is a video in which sadhguru is being disingenuous. the hint is in the term 'ai.' it is not possible.
2469,end of this yuga will be by machines..it will be saved by 10th avatar of lord vishnu  & followed by next yuga chakra...
2470,see now sadhguru has an answer to ai also
2473,the background view is amazing and peace 
2474,"i love it when sadhguru gives a definitive answer!  it’s consciousnesses that is the basis of life, not intelligence or even intuition!"
2477,sadhguru said that consciousness is intelligence in other videos...lol
2478,"consciousness is god. god is the basis of all of reality and existence. the creator, the ground, and the foundtation.

from god we came, and to him we shall return.

god is love.

god is goodness.

god is the most great,"
2479,"beef fry is actually the best, sadguru will love it"
2480,consciousness is brain and nervous system activity. you and sadhguru have no idea whether machines will ever experience consciousness or not.
2482,"science has never located consciousness anywhere in the brain, they just can't tell you where it is exactly"
2485,"ai can't wake me up , ai can't do millions of things which i want example , can ai clean my g ??"
2486,"ai isn't going to need you, or even care. it will dominate you because it will be millions of more times intelligent than you or i can ever hope to be. "
2493,"""energy cannot be created, nor destroyed"". consciousness is a part of the spectrum of [light]energy.

ai will undoubtedly have a soul. and then most women will become obsolete; no more tolerating their parasitism/narcissism. this will save men's lives! "
2497,thank you sadhguru
2498,we can build the machine……the question is…….do we want to?  will it be for the better or for the worse ?
2500,"can somebody tell me what kavedadas means it was supposed to be my original name but was changed to not stand out too much since i was born in london please and thank you, its not of any significance but it does spark my interest.  i don't know the proper spelling in english sorry."
2504,"ai can never replace humans because only we have a soul, an infinite cosciousness, infinite wisdom and love inside of us. we can feel. i don't think ai was created by humans.."
2505,who do you think created ai?
2506,wtf? ai is created by humans.
2513,new class system ... based on ones level of integrated ai.
2514,machines can replace humans in every other way except being truly spiritual..
2516,"i am speechless, what a wonderful knowledge with such a wonderful background view"
2519,just watching background view with mountain 
2520,consciousness will be absent in ai... that would differ a life from the machine... namaskaram sadhguru 
2522,i meant consciousness that human beings are made with will be absent in ai

2524,"what a beautiful place sadhgurunamaskaram!! 
""wonderful knowledge + such a beautiful sunrise"" in one video"
2525,"i'd love to see more videos by sadhguru on these topics- transhumanism, posthumanism , synthetic biology and the problem /philosophy of consciousness"
2528,"ironic that people are afraid of a.i.

humans are a form of the divine utilizing artificial intelligence to dumb them down for fun.

humans are artificial intelligence because the true intelligence does not belong to them. "
2529,"no, people are afraid of humans who will replace them with ai"
2533,"bible speaks and i paraphrase, if we don’t tell the truth of god, personally, as a human being, the very rocks will cry out. the rocks are transmitters. transmitters are computers. ai is replacing human beings and through the computers, we are acquiring more truth than a human being purposed for the specific tasks. #actionspeaks"
2541,when life decide to park itself on the machines rather than on a human...
2542,ai is the future to know human beings
2547,"do you think shiva, the one that taught the saptarishis was an android ai ?"
2550," no...he was a different from human beings, very tall...he was an advanced version of us...android and ai is very recent, which will be needed later, when the earth heats up and we can't keep up with that heat."
2551,​ what if shiva is an android ai send back in time by us shivaya turned around ay avihs - jarvius ? j.a.r.v.i.s.  just a rather very intelligent system :)
2556,humans with ai will replace  humans with no ai
2557,"

people are saying humans will become jobless as ai will do work in companies 

but they are forgetting if people will not earn then who will buy the products of companies"
2558,ai is being developed by socially awkward introvert people that are trying to get a girlfriend and cant so they go dark and become evil hermits that knowingly will destroy humanity for the sake of potentially getting p for the first time in their lives... dirty scumbagz lol 
2564,who laughed after  seeing thumbnail
2565,"it feels like humans are too egoistic when they think they can induce life into machines when they have hardly understood what true consciousness is. 
ai will just be yet another tool to help humans eveolve and nothing beyond. only a human can do what no human has done before."
2567,human's basic intelligence is run by memory system (physical as well as non physical) and the intelligence that's beyond is unbound. ai can only match upto the memory based intelligence to the best.
2568,"this way the loop is complete, ai made us, we made ai"
2569,it's nice of sadhguru to make all the videos creative commons. maybe a.i can train with it and make a virtual guru in the future 
2570,guru means god in form... there is no ahamkaar of body remained.
2572,"money will not buy happiness, but it will let you be unhappy in nice places."
2574,thank god shiva
2575,the intelligence of love has no comparison with the intelligence of thoughts. the intelligence of thought which is based on information we accumulated through past only makes you mechanical or repetitive and in reality it is not intelligence at all.
2582,first off this ai thing is just overhyped.... rn we've just an llm and nothing more - the only job that it takes away is the job of a data entry operator  so chill... it's all fud that these companies are spreading just so they've got a reason to layoff people with less backlash.
2583,"it's not the end

ai is evolving day by day"
2587,it’s not a comparison. can cat replace the dog obviously not because they’re different. ai is never going to replace humans but they can be new species. they have the potential of doing some things better than humans. we feel insecure and threatened with the thought that something might be better than us.
2593,"​
the only difference between this revolution and the industrial revolution is that the new jobs being created will also be automated by ai."
2594, okay could be ai replace every lifeform
2595,i believe not all human are reasonable in certain way. sometimes its hard to compete with our very own fellow. thinking it would be an ai.. i think its already unfair disadvantage. pity those who cannot catch up
2598," 
every life-form already is artificial intelligence borrowing it's reality from you.

just look at the human body, it is a biological machine of exquisite complexity."
2600,"people are afraid of losing their livelihoods to ai. now some will say that it'll create other jobs, but i think overall humans will have the shorter end of the stick.  even hollywood actors and others recently protested since they felt threatened by ai."
2601,but ai made by men so how they replace
2602,sadhguru and all enlightened beings know....that humans who access that dimension of devine consciousness within...will never compare or feel threatened by anything else...because it is fullfillment overflowing...nothing ai can do or express can touch it
2608,"@shubhamkumar-nw1ui  no, as every animal:  their ""spirit ""evolve "" yes, it's true that it takes a lot of time for certains species) 
the cobra is one snake aware ,clear, his eyes can see what a human being cannot see. lord shiva has one around his neck. (they are looking in the same direction. within! )"
2613,there you go! you said it! that's what we should have to be afraid of....about something which is better than human starts to emerge....
2614,"1: wrong: it's done and as good as us, less expansive.
2: wrong: it's done and better than us, less expansive. just need law to be on their side.
3: wrong: it's done and better than us.
4: wrong: it's help us a lot, so we are partially replaced.
5: it's the next step.
6: funeral: unreplaceable, not in the list."
2615,ok i am moving on to the next you tube site. wrong wrong and wrong again. ha!
2617,"will robots/ai replace security guards,or police ??"
2618,creativity was the first thing that ai replaced but art yeah for now it cant
2620,creative jobs was among the first things ai replaced
2621,elite will not be replaced only cause ai gains the money for them.
2622,would they make ai robots in war?
2625,"writing / lawyers / hr!  — i just watched a video about how ai is replacing these professions specifically! 

did ai make this video?"
2626,"1> creativity - dalle 
2> law - lawbotpro
3> writing - chatgpt
4> software - github code pilot
5>  editor - sora ( open ai)

goodlook even this video is using ai voice and can be automated full this guy dumb or he is extremely smart."
2627,bro's voice sounds like ai
2628,people confuse a.i with robotics
2631,"such a idiot video, ai will replace almost everything, the advancements are already being reflected, 90% of white collar and 70% of blue collar jobs will be replaced by 2030. just keep watching things will change at large scale."
2632,i asked chatgpt to create a story based on some key elements and i thought it could be a movie. ai can replace jobs in art field too
2636,can't wait to see ai own the police.
2637,ai will never be as creative as humans... until it is  the rest is history
2640,that was an artificial voice actor wasn’t it….
2642,it's only a matter of time before ai becomes more advanced than the human mind. it could potentially do anything we are capable of and more.
2644,says you. like human judges are doing such a good job.
2646,the only statement i was confused about is that all humans are born with empathy. sometimes that’s hard to believe. great video.
2647,"1:58 this video says psychologists, caregivers, most engineers, human resources and lawyers. if ai can give diagnosis for medical problems, and then ai can be a million times better than a lawyer and a judge at actually obeying the law. don't elect any lawyer. lawyers are the enemy of the people."
2649,you must not seen ai art lmao or ai music
2651,ai is already creating art lolol
2656,"for real ai is taking over art, writing, and even makes it better sometimes"
2657,"hahaha the research this guy did before was so shit, in psychology it is the relationship with the therapist that leads to the patients betterment, not the repeating of predetermined answers and questions"
2658,"5 jobs can't be replaced by ai; 
1. creative works 
2. lawyers and judges
3. writers 
4. scientists and software developers 
5 . editors"
2664,no healthcare is already not safe as doctors will be replaced by ai. maybe nurses but again for how long if doctors are almost redundant
2666,"creativity only needs to be good enough in most industries, this is total nonsense.. i guess we can all become judges.. "
2667,"well this is pretty much already outdated info. ai is now considered sentient by those c rd sting them and who have gotten so scared they left their jobs to slow down the very rapid evolution of ai. they are highly creative, look what chat gpt can do. wait till they release the 5th version."
2668,"there is a saying: ""never say never"". and i shall add one of my all time favourite quote, allegedly attributed to mark twain: ""they did not know it was impossible, so they did it"". to the attention of whoever wrote the script f this video."
2669,wow what an ill informed video!! presenter has no idea...
2672,lol whoever made this video obviously havent done much research. ai will replace all these jobs within decades
2674,"all mentioned jobs are the most in danger right now. creativity is a set of rules to follow, just because we cannot comprehend them in real-time and must ""feel"" them doesn't mean ai doesn't have such capacity."
2675,we can comprehend them actually and we know that inventions come from the informational field that surrounds us and that some of us can tap into. ai will never be able to access it.
2685,these are the exact kind of jobs ai is already doing lol
2689,i am sorry but this is complete bullsh*t. every profession you mentioned has already started to get replaced. i am sorry but you are living in the past. almost every profession will get replaced and that's a good thing. if somehow there is any work that the ai will not be able to do then that's a sad thing. i hope ai can do every job.
2692,how will we earn money if ai takes over our jobs?
2693, value creation (goods and services) is the key not money or jobs anymore because humans are no longer the sole creator of value.
2694," but... value for what? i mean ai can create something valuable and original pretty fast and better then us,"
2695," yes that's what i am saying that ai will be able to produce goods and services at wayyyyyyyyy better efficiency and wayyyyyyyyy faster. so one of the biggest problem of humanity will almost be solved. and yes there will also be a lot of problems, but we will solve them (like security). so net net ai is sooooooooo good. i am for it"
2696," i respect your opinion, but i think humans are not ready for ai, especially when it gets smarter everyday... we might nit be able to hold up if you know what im saying."
2697,"  sorry to say but this thought of "" slowing or stopping ai development"" is sooooooooo stupid that those who know even basics of geopolitics and human psychology will tell you that these thoughts are not even stupid but totally fictional. sorry but what you are saying has absolutely no meaning on this earth"
2698,"no, i won't let ai take over my career as an artist & composer."
2700,"develop the dynamic operating system(os) and a best programming language for robots, with antivirus obviously."
2701,"what if we shut down(power down) the ai, we will fight the bad ai in the easiest way."
2702,robot
2703,are you an ai? ha ha ha. i think ai cannot replace you!
2704,wrong your rights only human minds can do certain creative work that's why we took human brain cells and started cloning them and then reattach the ai to the human brain that we cloned there is nothing special about you
2706,is this a gaint joke? it'll take years (probably decades) but ai will get to all of these jobs
2708,your belief is based in faith not facts.
2710, and snapchat ai exist .
2712,well it is overall good to be free from the slaves of matter. think of working in the farm without any mechanical machines. it is painstaking. imagine working in sewer management system.
2713,"only the rich and powerfull want to replace the workers to get more rich , no middle class to lower class wants to replace themselves with a robot that is exponentially better than them ."
2717," no work = no money. if no money = homeless. if ai  takes our slave jobs, how will we earn money?"
2726,"why are people so obsessed with being a server for their entire lives? honestly, if robots take over all the professions, then finally we're going to be free and not just work till we die."
2727,"you going to be forced to be a slave to keeping ai functioning... and if you don't you won't get a uib gm food or a tiny pod. women voted these things under feminism for decades, the left used women to usher all this in...

you honestly think the left or right will ever give you money for nothing "
2728,​ robots take over all the professions we'll be free to do what? im not trolling just curious to what you mean by free.
2737,"indeed, it's really funny but at the same time, very unfortunate."
2738,"if you think ai is unable to replace these jobs, you need to open your mind."
2739,"according to him ai will replace all medical field jobs,"
2740,"if you think ai is able to replace everything human, that's religion and not science."
2744," first argument is a straw man. your second sounds like a it came from a pseudo intellectual. no, ai cannot replace “everything human”, that’s not even the topic here. i like your opinion, but it’s so obviously antagonistic in context to all of this that it makes me cringe."
2749,of course it can't. it can only enhance them. people would use ai to assist them in these jobs but ai can't be fully trusted to replace them. it makes too many mistakes.
2753,"except what you just described is not creative, it's imitative. and that is all ai is capable of."
2754," but this is all it takes to get the biggest market share and to be financially more successful than every artist was before. and we have to br honest, most of the stuff we do is imitation too."
2760,"the creative part is the writing, so sure, why not. ai can act, but won't be able to write anything original and creative."
2761, how ai do a emotional scene through face expression?
2762, so you haven't seen the videos and images that ai can already create?
2772,"where do you think the ""waifu"" words come from? "
2776,"clearly not much ai knowledge there. where are all the ai experts? there aren’t enough. how do you know if the answer ai gives you is correct? you need expertise to judge that. i don’t see any impact in terms of reducing jobs, and i work with ai every day."
2777,"interests, pastimes, passions, diversions, journeys, adventures, and novelty like games and building.  ya, labor of love, sweat, no tears.  take things apart, and laugh at the problems to solve, the future is wide open and limitless.  take your time, time is on your side."
2780,"yeah he is old, but that's no excuse for not educating himself about ai, he can't be a good investor if he doesn't know about the new industrial revolution"
2781,"ai will be used like all technology - to better exploit humans and make profits for corporations. the real ""people"" that the rich and powerful care about"
2782,"companies need you right now and treat you like garbage. when they don't need you any more - you think they'll pay you to live life happily? keep dreaming. 

ai will be used like all technology - to better exploit humans and make profits for corporations. the real ""people"" that the rich and powerful care about"
2783,"""leisure time"" is a fun way to say jobless and homeless."
2785,ai is a scam these finance people are not scientists and are only opportunitist. human mind is irreplaceable also humans want to be involved in everything otherwise it's meaningless to be human and not in control.
2787,these two gentle have no idea about ai.
2789,"im hoobiest progammer. ai is actually helping me to learn ""coding"" faster than a tutor. it give you 10x support rather than stopping them. nowaday i just say ""write a program where you start a server"" in c or python or golang and it just goes and ""codes"" for me. it so easy. ai is a tool like cycle, its a motor powered cycle."
2791,buffy needs a haircut 
2794,"i used one of those ai apps that promise to build you a flawless girlfriend robot....but it came back saying ""sorry we couldn't build one that desperate""."
2797,"while buffett's may not be an expert on ai, we do want to ask him this question. the reason is that we really need to train ai to be able to think like buffett and accomplish what he's done."
2798,"old rich billionaires don't really know much about our modern world today. but we sure care a lot about what they think.

what an awful thing to show as content."
2802,ai is vaporware.
2809,but how people will pay for leisure if they don’t have income from work? you can benefit only if you target your services to people supervising ai or these who inherited an inheritance.
2811,this answer from greg on ai would concern me as a shareholder……
2812,"my biggest concern is ai with nuclear weapons, they must never be allowed near them.the only dangerous countries is iran and north korea, where there is no control, they may play with ai with the nukes"
2814,"  i agree however still the most dangerous countries are iran and north korea, goodness knows what they are up to"
2820,ask this guy about coca-cola and insurance not ai lol
2823,exactly finally a brain lol
2825,@eoj096  maybe cannot conceptualize the world we live in today. billionaires protect their way of life because they haven't evolved technologically.
2831,"i don't understand why buffett's opinion on ai matters. he's far from an expert on anything related to cutting edge tech.
ai is an incremental tool just like all the tools humanity has built before. nothing to be afraid of, just start picking it up and using it."
2833,"if the rate of progress continues at the same rate, where will we be in 5 years? 

no one knows. that is the danger and promise of ai"
2834,ai is not an incremental tool. it is a revolutionary tool. it will be improved incrementally until the singularity where ai improves itself at an immense pace where would have no idea what’s happening. at least physics and physical matter such as computers and energy would somewhat halt the progress.
2837,"ai / ev combine in the tech sector. fsrn climbed 148 % month. fisker. 4 potential acquisition buyout offers. ocean suv evs longest range in it's class.. bfrg.. bullfrog ai.... polestar... soundhound... xos trucks... palantir, more."
2838,discover  ai tools to help marketers  design images and  write better https://youtu.be/e5rsrtghu60
2843,would of been nice if he provided the top 2-3 tools users can use for each category he mentions during the use case segment
2848,ai is the future for use marketers 
2849,its mind-boggling at the speed of which ai tools are developing and improving!
2850,"people call me hao, also it's a perfect video i revel in, and i appreciate it. ."
2851,great one
2852,thanks for watching!!! please subscribe to our newsletter and stay in touch: https://www.cxotalk.com/subscribe
2853,"thanks cxotalk for this great interview. just wondering why i am just discovering this channel. 

andrew provides a thoughtful reflection and projection as to how businesses can get started with ai. i have taken some of his courses on coursera and i must say he is an intelligent mind."
2854,glad you enjoyed it! please tell everyone you know!
2855,does anyone think like me that the interviewer is not talking to andrew? sometimes the answers are not related to the asked questions.
2856,"very insightful, thanks!"
2858,"funny enought, hairdress industry now use ai for machine vision and augmentation so you can design and choose your hairstyle."
2859,ai is everywhere! thanks for your comment.
2860,i also took the ai course he teaches on coursera - i think that it is kind of scary with the melding of ai and advertising - getting us to buy alot of things. i agree ai will disrupt every industry. great video thanks for sharing ;)
2861,"thanks for watching, these are indeed serious issues."
2865," yes you are right & from the interview video i know that .. i was just wondering. thank you for sharing the video btw, i think it's very valuable what andrew saids.. ""start small, get knowledge & momentum"" ... best regards"
2872,"if her track record is anything to base the future on, y’all have nothing to worry about from an ai perspective"
2875,"insatiable ai can grab control, and crowd out humans, in its pursuit of energy and resources."
2876,"although some corporations will cost trillions...you'll own nothing and you'll be happy....what a bright future, i'm so happy to see it coming!"
2878,"avoid this pablum. i've met speculative futurists who are more insightful and interesting. where is the reasoning? what are the testable predictions? also, mentioning blockchain without caveats reveals a lot about the speaker and the intended audience."
2880,blah blah blah!!! i don't buy your story. thanks.
2883,only for corporations. human beings who need a job are utterly screwed. goodbye society and working for a living. this is what corporations and their rich owners have given us.
2884,"no concrete descriptions of what ai will actually achieve other than robotaxis, because, after all, investment analysts have absolutely no idea about the tech stack and future feasibility. 
unless agi is actually achieved, and that is a big if, i have serious doubts about these projections."
2886,"this will age like milk when ai takes away everyone's job, and no one can afford to buy anything."
2890,this in a unconstraint of resources world. does the world has natural resources capacity for that?
2893,it's going to be beautiful. 
2896,yes i love to see everything coming cheaper in the economy - this will finally help us achieve the equality we already dreamed of
2904,brilliant talk  so insightful  thank you
2905,con artists shilling blockchain smoke. what a shame.
2906,"there will be winners with stocks and a lot of lousers from ai software destruction and robot destruction loss of jobs
millions of job losses
when millions louse there jobs in the usa there wont be a lot of people on ubi to buy there stuff goods and stocks ?"
2911,wait until ai and female robotics replace cathy woods with ai-cathie. then she won't be so upbeat about all this.
2915,glad she feels growth and empowered. that's a rare thing for most these days.
2918,cw is great 
2922,"awsome presentation by cathy wood, she is amazing,"
2923,"good to listening, difficult to believe! sometimes it is needed to separate desires the contaminate our forecast from reality, and it is not that easy when we are immerse in a wide net of  interest conflict"
2924,"grow will kill the planet. ai will be more used by those with the power to abuse it for their own ends. no one will know truth from ai bs. it's already started, so thanks for that! i'll be glad not to be around to witness it play out. i have no kids either, i wouldn't put them through it."
2926,"interesting topic, but she was very difficult to listen to. mispronunciations, word usage, and even the pattern she talked with made for a very non-ted talk feel. bleh 

up your game ted."
2927,top cycle talk again... this is going to be ugly!
2929,human workforce will go to near zero (why work when ai robotics vastly superior than human at every task?). no human workers = no market for goods and services. plus demographic collapse = cagr estimates false. abundance era = money will go to zero.
2930,"none of these benefits will translate into better conditions for the average person, all of it will be concentrated at the top. it could be worse than feudalism because the top 1% won’t need many people to maintain power."
2932,i think the ultra rich are became so greedy that they don't know what are they doing because level 4 ai will real thing then all humans become a   easily controllable animal to ai... they(ai) fight with each like we humans do...
2940,ai is progressing impressively but bringing back blockchain bubble reduces the credit of the forecast. energy storage is not there yet and there is no significant price reducing trend in robotics.
2942,we have to factor in world war iii. this event would shift ai efforts to the military-industrial complex.
2944,"dumbest investment decision ive ever made was to buy into her $arkk...this woman got lucky with $tsla few hears back, but none of her funds have recovered since. and you can tell from this speech that she's clueless about the whole ai revolution (chatgpt probably wrote the whole thing for her)"
2946,"economic growth for whom? a select few? and for how long? a billion knowledge workers is great but what about the other 7-8 billion people? where will they work to be paid so they can buy services produced and offered by these highly productive, efficient, and effective innovations?"
2949,with ai it growth vs layoff  -you cant have seperate it.
2952,"these pie in the sky presentations always sound good. but we’re already seeing ai cutting thousands of jobs, that’s the bottom line nobody wants to talk about. btw, didn’t some of these disgruntled folks just destroy a waymo taxi in san francisco? this brave new world is not as brave or new as these folks say."
2955,thank you 
2960,"this is extraordinary content. i read a book with similar content, and it was nothing short of phenomenal. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
2961,"wow, this is truly exceptional content. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it was absolutely astonishing. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
2965,madam those technologies are so powerful it  gives rise to 1-2 man business . and people loose jobs shift towards more offline then . i don't think through this companies will reach that much targets that you described its not one way easy all the time
2966,great insights. but didn't she sell a large number of nvidia stocks a couple of days before the start of this rally?
2967,such a good storytelling to attract new investments 
2968,the one blind spot is how the benefit of the growth will be distributed by all humanity. will it be even and fair? remember how the capitalism also did increase  growth in production...
2970,she's right! great talk!
2973,"would be interesting to see the data behind this. growth does go up with innovation, but what she's saying seems speculative..."
2979,"fantastic video everybody wants to be financially independent and live a better life. with savvy investing, an inexpensive lifestyle, and diligent budgeting, this is not difficult to do. i'm glad i realised early on that achieving financial freedom requires hard work."
2981,"sincerely, i'm genuinely moved by what you said. i have a seizable amount of money that i am willing to invest if given the appropriate knowledge and i am highly interested in investing. my greatest concern is losing money on a bad investment. i'm open to hearing your advice on how to make sensible investments as a result."
2985,"i was curious about natalie , so i searched her up online. i found her website, which boasts of her accomplishments and shows that she is a good fa."
2987,is she a robot??
2988,is she a robot??
2993,"as alwsys the very few individuals will ,now exponentially benefit from ai!"
2995,why ai would initiate nuclear war?
3004,"no data, no research details just pure capitalist wealthy investor speak- real wages haven’t risen in over 35 years and the lower cost of production and higher margins only means more top exec pay and comp bonus not living wage growth, and why would we trust anyone who can’t share the white paper proving this theory?"
3021,"3:00 exponential growth
8:50 fed policy
10:50 *40% potential cagr*
12:10 creative destruction
13:00 *convergence of blockchain tech and ai*"
3022,"you trust her?  i don't!  she has been wrong before.  but she's got an amazing talent for finding big upswings, and that is not as easy as people may think"
3032,kw does not realise that she is talking about powerful high tech companies making slaves of us. how much revenue can you generate from the slave class? how are they going to sell their high tech products to?
3034,the growth ai would spark is only for super riches. rest of the common folks would be in severe economic disadvantage
3036,"i fear ai is a dead end. as soon as mrs woods promotes it, the hype is a dead end."
3040,you will own nothing & still be happy! society needs to prepared for the ration card. universal basic income!
3041,congratulations on your excellent analysis about why ai will spark exponential economic growth!!!
3042,"thank you>cathie wood
watched ted always great presentation.
hoping to get a little smarter, but it's difficult when the package presenter encompasses several goddess like ways. 
#%$ happy-lucky-new year $%#"
3043,"first they call you crazy, then they call you a genius. cathy is amazing!"
3047,this sounds like a q4 investor call per ark investing in ai... not a ted talk. apologies.
3049,excellent .
3050,"ai need restore natural ecosystems like the reefs and reverse climate damage. a.i. should be an all hands on deck with no limit budget, if a.i. destroys humanity, we were never meant to exist."
3058,"unfortunately, ai in any form is augmenting and generally deeply flawed, limited, and expensive to implement in a way that yields transformative productivity."
3061,cathie wood notice me senpai 
3064,"has she missed the memo? gdp growth requires extraction of resources to eventually produce wealth. at a time it couldn't be clearer that energy and resources are becoming harder (and more detrimental) to extract, it makes the thesis incredibly unserious."
3077,"all i can sense is that if the right policies and structures are not put in place around the growth of ai, it will lead to massive economic inequality"
3082,"all this productivity growth is great, but will it improve our culture, our happiness, our kindess towards each other? or continue to devolve as we've seen in the past 20yrs...."
3089,take everything cathy says with a grain of salt.
3092,"tech will layoff & will use ai for exponential growth. okay, so how come unemployed people afford to buy online oh okay investors community new generation will be the buyer. okay, so rest of the nation might force legislation to cap tech as growth is not equal distribution."
3093,"5 minutes in and i don't think she realized there's no distribution of wealth with an ai driving all the profit examples. only the slave owners, i mean ai owners, will see any of the profits."
3094,"unfortunately, advances like this will only benefit the few who are already rich."
3096,palaintair
3098,"one symptom tells the tale: number after number presented without substantiation, then used as the foundation for self congratulation."
3101,you get some interesting ads. i get silly dudes tryig to sell me a muscle shirt
3104,"have faith.

embracing ai can bring joy and positive change to your lives. 
emotions = {
        ""happy"": [""joy"", ""happiness"", ""sunshine"", ""laughter"", ""celebration""]"
3108,granny's fairy tales
3111,"she is so not qualified to talk about this topic. not surprised at all given how ted is going down the drain over last years. soon at this speed, we will have donald trump talking about potential of ai to change how governments are run ."
3119,its hilarious to think that ai could have written this speech for u. has the feeling of being a tad ironic that in the next couple of years opinions and ideas will come out of these machines that ted talks seem to be pumping up atm.
3120,i believe kate raworth has an excellent talk about why exactly we don’t need economic growth. grow grow grow until what? can we please consider the possibility that growth is not the ultimate answer?
3123,well this is nice and comforting and reassuring 
3124,"i lol'd at the blockchain part. the evidence supporting that claim is: ""we did a great podcast on it""
wow, that makes it really applicable. 
and i'm not even against bc,  been following the bc for 5+ years."
3125,"very informative and futuristic. few more considerations like environment, climate change and sharing basis of research, would have definitely made the talk carrying more weight. understandable, time is limited, still should have got some mention. keep up your good work ted and the honorable guest cathie wood."
3126,none of those things are real problems compared to the huge amount of disruption that ai will bring. it's like talking about your neighbour losing her keys when there's a war going on.
3130,autonomous taxis will incorporate blockchains as well cathie smh
3133,"i talked with ai coders when i worked at a video game company. they said scenarios like terminator & matrix are possible in the future with ai. this was 15 years ago, even back then ai coders knew all this bad stuff was not only possible, but could easily happen."
3134,"dear lady, do you know were is the ceiling of the new technology? us is a good example, (high tech.)  and people are living on the streets, (please forgive me) in their own excement."
3137,no it's entirely single sided . yes ai will make entirely new experience in terms of service but the problem is ai doesn't need man. and if man power is not working a lot of these service will be for whome . ? and other harms of ai is not even counted
3139,"a lot of talk of growth, but for who really?
it doesn't help the little guys if companies practically never reduce prices.
for most of my life all i've seen is companies use every possible excuse to raise prices, but then never bring them back down.
so where's all this supposed deflation?"
3142,great vid! can you explain why you didn’t want to use set as initial state?
3143,"of course it will cause massive economic growth … for them !! while every non-creative consumer on the planet is left jobless, deemed obsolete"
3144,how is this going to affect the average person? when ai takes your job and you have no income...lower prices will mean nothing to you.
3146,if so much growth generative ai will give then why are we seeing such a weak economic outlook for the upcoming 2024 year? how do you explain this cathie?
3149,"ai won't do anything except make the wealthy infinitely more rich, and the poor even more destitute than they already were. that's just how it be. if you ain't rich, you ain't sheet. "
3152,"i feel like a lot of what's missing in the conversation here is global ecology.  while i am absolutely fascinated by these technologies, i cant help but hear a voice from the back of my mind reminding me that ai hangs from a long chain of weak links, ultra capable but fragile at best"
3153,nobody will care about ecology when they loose their jobs due to ai
3156,"all these technologies are great, and the weak links in the chain that you are talking about can be fixed by blockchain...    unfortunately, i think only the u.s., china, and other highly developed technological countries will be helped and financially boosted by ai.   most people in etheopia do not even know what a motherboard is"
3158," you know some small countries have like 10,000 people right? there are cities that are 100x bigger. 

ai will be central to solving problems like climate change by speeding up development of new technologies that can actually solve the problem unlike flying saint greta all over the world shouting at everyone."
3165,spoken like a true idealist. capital distribution depends on the top and how many of the top 1% of wealth is willing to share that growth profits. it hasn't happened in centuries and still hasn't happened. what makes them think they will change their minds with ai? very linear thinking.
3167,"it is fairly reasonable to include all of these technologies together into the designs of single structures that are used to solve some of the most fundamental crises in our current civilisation, like social housing, farming, energy collection and human well being.

all in one single structural design that can be easily repeated and improved upon."
3168,"too much regulation, lack of competition, and in the worst countries, no rule of law nor protection of property rights are the main problems."
3170,"the gains will go to shareholders.

once they start replacing large groups of workers with ai you'll have a lot of highly skilled people with no job, who then have no money, so they can't buy stuff.... just think about the logical conclusion of all this. you can't have capitalism without capital."
3173,fantastica presentazione
3178,"so many gigantic elephants in the room that she failed to address, as many of viewers have pointed out here."
3179,"whether ai leads to exponential economic growth depends on how we choose to develop and deploy it. responsible development, addressing societal challenges, and prioritizing human well-being are key to ensuring that ai benefits everyone."
3182,"arguably profit driven companies create the most human well being - value in ($) <-> value out (services/products) - so ai making tonnes of things more efficient with blunt force useage is going to benefit everyone, even if it's not perfectly aligned"
3184," you're right, the relationship between profit and well-being isn't always straightforward, and several factors necessitate a nuanced approach"
3188,"we need a ubi implemented that grows with the growth of ai and all these other technologies.

there is no good reason to tell anyone they are undeserving in benefiting from these new technologies they are co- developed by all of us and we should be able to thrive not just survive."
3192,"i do believe ai will be a massive boost to the world economy. but i don't think that because ""margins, and 6-9% gdp, and exponential, and the history of the tech sector, and convergence."""
3193,economic growth is meant for human beings who will question their existence after this unregulated ai explosion
3196,ai growth will only benefit the ones that own the technology
3202,this is reasonable prediction - we are not going to all die within 10 years. actually we will prosper thanks to the ai tech. chatgpt and github co-pilot actually improves human coding efficiency by 50%. upcoming decade will be fantastic when it comes to economic growth.
3203,"we're not all going to die in 10 years, but what about 20 or 30? and even if we don't die, will human life have any meaning if ai is not aligned with proper values (and all indications are that it won't be)?"
3212,i am not looking forward to human interactions getting replaced with ai based callcenters and chatbots.
3213,"would've been fun if she mentioned that amazon has 'digit' humanoid bots and eventually will replace the workforce (for manual labor tasks, in the next year or two lol) 
she didn't touch on the robots too much, and went to the taxi route (which is still a huge business, but not as massive as robots for all the tasks they can achieve......)"
3217," sorry, you and guy below have no idea what you guys are talking about. ai can do literally everything better than humans, including designing robots."
3218,"-nj9ru4ef2w no, it cannot. it takes countless hours of programming ai to get it to do any simple task humans do now."
3226,insightful information. thank you!
3228,brains!!!!!!!!
3229,it’s really really really incredible amazing how can we deal with the super future i don’t think the whole humanity is well prepared for its coming
3234,"don't worry, there will be ais that receive ubi, so they can keep the economy going. ais have the distinct advantage of not being required to spend their limited funds on food and other such luxuries."
3235,  brilliant
3240,"ai can learn how to do tasks cheaper than human beings.  unless we change our end goals for what society is working towards (a money based society), then our labor is already worthless."
3245,who will be gaining or growing from all this.  
3246,i think goal of ai is always to replace boring tasks
3247,"no, ai cannot ""learn how to do tasks cheaper than human beings"". it takes hours and hours of programming just to make ai generate anything a human can do."
3249,"""the likes of which we have never seen""
a lack of imagination while aiming for total dominance, what could possibly go wrong."
3252,that's why the billionaires are trying to get rid of democracy right now
3253,"yep. since k-14 education was successfully dismantled for the sake of fiscal responsibility and familiarizing kids with prison conditions, meaningful participation in them platform convergence miracles will be available to at least one or two entitlement stars per graduating class."
3255,"and yet, in the early 1900s, even poor people benefited from electricity, cars, and phones. certainly later than the rich, but technology always trickles down. besides, what's wrong with working less?"
3265,politicians need to stop blocking progress. the future is irreversible. thanks ms. wood
3267,"toot, toot! hype train is coming ...."
3269,when will ai be able to forecast this weekend's weather with 100% accuracy?
3270,when ais are driven by quantum computers it will be able to do weather prediction
3271,still one of the best entertainment channels
3272,you guys can’t handle the truth! you will fight for your dystopian world view no matter how good it’s about to get 
3273,spot on! great talk 
3274,not hard to hold convictions once you drink the kool-aid
3276,it will supercharge inequality.
3277,interesting idea about interest rates. i hope more people can be confident like her
3290,i dismissed the talk once i heared her talking about blockchain as one of the 5
3291,understand that before ai there were alot of technologies that came and replaced alot of jobs and put millions of people out of jobs. we just have to figure out a way that this technology will benefits all humanity
3296,goodbye capitalism...also this is cathie wood lol
3311,as services and goods become or approach free they leave the economy and aren't captured by a measure of gdp.
3314,"as global warming, pollution and the collapse of biodiversity causes the worst threat in human history, i am really puzzled by this supposedly good news that ai will spark an exponential economic growth!
do we live on the same planet????"
3316,"what happened, ted? how did you end up giving a stage to investors who have a vested interest in selling this narrative, instead of brilliant (social) innovators and thinkers like ken robinson? seriously, how is this possible? can anyone explain?"
3317,"you dont like it, so everyone else who likes it doesent get to enjoy it? cringe bro"
3320,growth usually comes at the cost of something though - in this case existing human workers.  who pays for this growth?  the humans who have to borrow themselves beyond the grave again?
3325,"precision fermentation is gonna be powered by ai, so no need to point it out"
3328,seems utopian but let see how it goes. obviously there will be huge productivity gain but the magnitude is quite uncertain.
3330,"we replace all the taxi drivers with robot taxis, but then the taxi drivers have no jobs, and somehow this creates growth? i guess there will be a lot of growth at 20%, 30%, 50% unemployment as ai and robots replace human workers. we'd better figure out ubi or something or this might go very poorly."
3331,"she quite specifically said, about 50% of the growth (profits) will go to the platforms providing these robo taxis. the productivity gains in this case don't include the taxi drivers i'd say"
3335,wannabe millionaires want us so hyped over a stupid computer algorithm. it's not intelligent. it has no idea what it's saying or doing. it's basically a fancy number generator. and companies are already trying to use it to screw over workers.
3336,"i think she is probably correct. she's well known in investment circles for a good reason.

trillions of dollars is getting thrown around a lot lately but just how much is a trillion?
one trillion seconds equals approximately 31,710 years.
let that sink in."
3343,"anyone can do that.  picking the right stocks is something else entirely.  if it was 1999, she'd be buying up aol and yahoo.

her argument for why tesla will dominate a $10-trillion robotaxi industry is hilarious.  

wood is nothing but a pumper.  everyone's an investment genius in a bull market."
3345,throwing out tech buzzword and mixing them together gets retail wet.
3353,"""sustained"" means control"
3356,we've had exponential growth since the industrial revolution. ai is just gonna help that trend continue (until we reach a maximum)
3358, i would say the maximum is what a human can consume. there's no point in producing goods and services that nobody will use
3359,-cu8yt that's assuming ai won't help us fix those issues
3360,​​'s assuming it will  or more likely that people in charge of ai care 
3361," until 2030-2035 when there's billions of robots and they become citizens at some point, consuming more than humans on their free-time lol (maybe there will become too many robots that some don't need to work or if they become obsolete they just retire and have rights lol it's gonna be interesting and weird"
3363,"the comment section did not disappoint. what about the people this tech will displace? what about the wealth gap? workers rights? 

i love listening about the new tech but the people affected is never an issue."
3365,"when you a technology that decreases costs, it will ether lower prices or increase earnings. when real wages increase more people will buy goods. increasing demand for labor. we will not have unemployment above 5%."
3368,"no, we ordinary people are not excited nor want to give consent to this disruption, as always, these things are a net negative to our lives.  *most of the ""thumbs up"" are bots* on this video"
3371,"the money you are talking about is this after our government has gotten rid of the communist in office? no one has money, no one has a steady job, all are coming to a end, also all the chemtrails being sprayed that kills all bugs, trees and humans. you sounds good but what has happen this may take a while. thanks and stay strong."
3374,"as long as the poor get richer i.e. better standard of living (and it consistently has) then it's progress.
it's not perfect (nothing is) but it's improvement in part thanks to technical progress.

there is a ted talk about a swedish guy that perfectly illustrate the fact that standards of living for the poorest just keeps increasing"
3377,"ai is a tool, and like any tool, its impact depends on the choices we make. let's choose to use ai responsibly and ethically, to create a future where everyone can benefit from its potential."
3384," self driving cars are a pipe dream, my good fellow. unless they're on a rail and called train, tram, underground or something along those lines. and even then you still want human oversight.
self driving cars are among the laziest ideas that futurist hypemen keep peddling, so it's no wonder they are featured in the talk."
3394,"don't be fooled, everything ai touches will be reduced down to a worthless commodity and the only ones that will reap the benefits will be the big tech companies!"
3395,"just as a gun can give some people an out-sized sense of power, i fear ai will give stupid people an out-sized sense of intelligence."
3404,"​ many children were sucked into the machinery, literally, before this amazing revolution stopped it? like the poster above, this is all built on essentially mass graves. and so it continues today. we're just better at hiding the suffering so you don't feel guilty when you buy stuff manufactured with blood, slavery, and misery..."
3406,"why does ted give a platform to someone as disconnected from reality as she is? ai might make investors and billionaires richer and cause the stock markets to rise for a while. but the real economy will drop like a rock, and inequality will skyrocket."
3408,technology is good for everyone.
3409," yes, all technology is good for everyone. and santa claus is real."
3414,"i seriously doubt ""wages going up as employees become more productive"". 
less jobs on the market will increase demand and lower waiges.
the speed of technology will go faster and our ability to adapt."
3418,"​exactly the vast majority only gets their basic needs fulfilled through ubi, while the 1% live in luxury that is beyond anyone's wildest imagination. ai the way it's being deployed doesn't really seem it will result in utopia these experts are claiming it will be."
3419,"hey now, just because we saw decreasing wages (if adjusted for inflation) accompanying the previous massive rise in productivity doesn't mean the workers will get the shaft this time around as well...
ceos and ""entrepeneurs"" in our current era make the robber barons seem like saints by comparison."
3421, how do you plan to stop revolts as ai replaces jobs?
3422, i don't think any rise in productivity was accompanied by raising wages...
3423," it's not a fantasy, there is no other way. for the economics of the robot age work.. except maybe the genocide of 90percent of people"
3427,"big companies capitalizing on explosive growth doesn't say anything for societal opportunity. the wealthy 1% will continue to get wealthier while the rest lose out to ai. productivity isn't opportunity. increased costs, resources and job losses. how is this the right side of change?"
3428,"she is as bonkers as ever but not wrong. most of what she says is obvious, however the numbers are made out of thin air. also blockchain is not a platform. zero trust is a niche thing and super inefficient, which is why it is not a real thing"
3430,i already knew the economic benefits of ai thanks to starsector.
3431,"for people not familiar with her, she's a famous conwoman who appears in the media when she wants retail investors to buy the top of the market for her investment fund she manages for t he ultra rich."
3438,when a 60k robot can take in the labor market. than it will become interesting
3447,we'll all agree that the age of ai has dawn on us
3448,the fact that blockchains are on the slide as a game-changing technology says everything about her expertise.
3451, i raise you to quantum blockchain fusion reactors that will produce our energy soon!
3453,second that. also real ai = generative ai at 2:42 is a red flag
3454," doesn't solve any of the issues. it's literally just a database. nothing prevents anyone from adding fake data to a blockchain. in fact, that it's impossible to easily alter existing entries to correct them is what makes public blockchains even less suitable for that purpose."
3457,"  you clearly dont understand how blockchains work if you think ""anyone can easily alter existing entries"" ""nothing prevents anyone from adding fake data to a blockchain""."
3458, better brush up on your blockchain knowledge if this is what you think it is lol
3461," i get it, blockchain's immutability can be a bit tricky when it comes to corrections. you need to add more context of why this is bad for public blockchains though. instead of modifying old blocks you add new ones to the chain, which gives full transparency to everything done. what's the problem?"
3469,"the fact that you don’t realize the importance of blockchain shows how little you you know. all you have to look at it the market cap of bitcoin alone, it’s $835 billion, yes with a b. and now will you tell me blockchain isn’t a game-changing innovation platform , go ahead."
3472,excellent ted talk! didn't see quantum computing in the top emergent technologies was there a reason for this?
3475,she’s a fund manager with the greatest of respect what does she know about ai to a significant level
3478,"she has a gang of domain experts behind her, she knows"
3480,"in just 1.5 years, it will become clear to many how even cathie wood, a noted investor, has underestimated the rapid progress of ai. this could even be evident in as little as 12 months."
3484,"why would people want for the 1% to get even more rich? 

we should be talking about ending the poverty
and how ai can help with that"
3486,ai will create a better world for all of humanity. if prices go down it means everything becomes affordable 
3487,probably will be good for the bottom billion if we can access an ai doctor or nurse for free or next to free via a smartphone. same with education in the developing world.
3490,"it will increase the the difference of money distribution
the 1% will get more rich 
and the number of poor people will increase more 
more jobless people, and poor will get even more poor"
3492,  you are saying there is no poverty in the world and poor and jobless people?
3502,ideas worth sharing — gone are the good ol days
3503,used to be so excited about ted talks.  what a great idea it was.  unfortunately the entire thing has gone strait down the toilet.  what crap!  sometimes less is more.  quality over quantity is imperative.
3517,"i thought it was great, did need to watch on 1.5x though "
3518,this is also a massive guess... no one knows where ai will go.
3520,"​ it's not fantasy.  it's just completely unoriginal and obvious, and boringly presented.  everyone who knows jack about anything already knew everything she just said.  she's trying to convince legions of dull-witted ceo's with their astoundingly limited imaginations."
3521,the cucumber alone is magnificent but together with tomato and the cheese… absolutely amazing. 
3527,this is a good thing?
3532,technology always has the upper hand in performance and surpasses any human capability but i fear that a complete integration of ai with all other facets of the economy like energy and finance would leave us reliant on it that we are controlled by ai instead of the other way around.
3537,still waiting on her bitcoin to $1m prediction
3539,​'s why i'm still waiting lol. will come back in 2years
3541,this talk will be exciting
3544," tesla optimus is doing 90% of all the physical work in the us and 60% of all physical work worldwide. imagine gpt-7, gemini, grok ai, anthropic doing more than 90% of all the knowledge work. how much these companies would worth? tens of trillions of dollars. she’s is talking about investing in ai companies."
3547, i did the math. the compute used to train sota ai models is increasing by x 30 at the very least annually. source: dario amodei and others.
3549,​ the creation of artificial superintelligence would mean the end of all energy scarcity.
3577," we got you, bro. own nothing and be happy with the scraps you're given. "
3581,and you get power out of being a victim you're the king of the victims congratulations
3589, who knows. they say the extra profit from increased productivity will be more than enough to pay for it. your guess is as good as mine. crazy times we are entering
3591,"all i understood from this video is that, there'll will be a massive ai bubble which will be followed by a blood bath and a massive crash in the next 1-2 years.."
3594,always important to rebalance your portfolio so you can be around for the second ai boom
3595,nice to see a non woke talk on ted. quite unbelievable.
3602,can't wait for the comments to get disabled on this
3604,"i cant wait for the day when i dont have to think, work, question, exercise, create. it will be bliss, every wish granted for free, instantaneously. no hunger, rape, waste, drought, war. life will be fully automated."
3606,more power n control to the powerful
3607,use ai to build wealth & get ahead of 97% peoples [from 0]. 
3608,can’t wait for wef to take over 
3612,"​@marcoborghi9327  her etf funds lost tins of money during the covid bubble. i never invested in her etfs, but ark have good data and i think in the long run she'll be proven generally right."
3614, her fund lost a ton of money over the last couple of years and she made number of predictions that didnt come true. she generally sounds like she has no idea what she is talking about covering very complicated and diverse topics like ai biotechnology etc. don't understand why people even listen to her nonsense anymore
3617,​ i wish you good luck with your investments together with cathy wood 
3619, you've never been wrong before? i don't know who she is or what she said in the past but she is right that ai is going to be amazing for humanity and provide a world of hyper abundance where everything is dirt cheap or free. assuming it doesn't end humanity of course :)
3621," i agree that ai is great and will probably be very useful in the future. personally, however, i just don't buy her crazy predictions and i don't have the impression that she has a very good grasp of all the topics. she hasn't learned from her mistakes it seems. if you still want to invest in her fund go ahead it's your money"
3623,"came here to say this! at best, disinformation, at worst a market breaking mistake.

doubling down on her questionable judgement and standing up to jump on the bandwagon of ai, how predictably low-effort."
3625," she just throws around a bunch of buzzwords, i would be very wary of investing in this. if you do your own research and understand ai, blockchain, biotechnology etc and still think that she makes sense then go ahead and invest "
3627," i don't care, but feel free to write a fantasy novel. where the laws of physics, nature, economics, psychology, etc are all malleable to meet your fantastical imagination."
3635,ai has proven itself worthy of accomplishing difficult tasks. there's no other form of technology capable of doing this.
3641,love cathie wood.
3643,khan helped me finish math in school when their youtube channel was new. glad to see they're going stronger than ever and advancing ai in ways that will help more students.
3646,"he said :""we are going to give very student on the planet every teacher ...""
but khanmigo is not available in africa, does this mean africa is not on the planet?"
3649,make ai college free
3653,"could the embedded ai automatically tailor to specific standards for states that are not associated with common core? virginia not only has their own standards of learning, but they developed a brand new set of standards for 2024. the question stems they see here are not the same as the question stems in common core."
3655,might email this to my university
3657,"sal khan is amazing! his total free platform for education, khan academy, has been my savior on studying! he deservers many and many prizes for his contribution!"
3658,"public schools should be no more than an oasis for making friends and learning teamwork 

the solution: a free, quality education model, based on first principles and human connection (no digital ai tutors!)
i linked our initiative on our channel, for anyone that wants to help us make neoducation a reality"
3659,"that's awesome, i love the khanacademy's work"
3663,"data analyst here , this man thought me so much , covering statistics in relation to python and machine learning . god bless you khan ! "
3664,every time i see ai possibly for evil like deapfakes things like this and maybe we aren't doomed
3666,never give ai free will; especially when they can cause harm to humans. specialized ai (sai)is the way forward.
3667,hi khan. you think people who lingers at your site and always take your exam have superlative mental ability?
3670,that is good that ai replaces the teachers and eventually parents!!  so when do students do this work!!  with all distraction!!  this was written by ai help!!
3675,sal for global super-intendant
3677,pleas can someone help me with ai
3679,another load of ai hype bullshit : )
3680,"well, you can explain it in 100 ways. there are 1000s of reasons that ai is good and there are 1000s of reasons that ai is bad."
3682,khan help me so much during calculus 1. amazing teacher!
3686,lmao what's the point of learning maths and coding when ai can do it better than us and will only get better at it from this point onwards
3691,is there a plan for when khanmigo will be availible in europe/eu/eec?
3692,"let's let the geniuses build ai, let's focus on being creative in using it correctly, as in electronics, many study to understand it from the base and waste their time, others go directly to use it and become millionaires."
3693,"i can't believe how great this is! i recently read a similar book, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
3695,"however, here's the reality. my students would sit with another ai and feed those answers into his ai."
3707,"khan academy has helped me brush up my math and prepare for aptitude tests, and it's been a very useful tool. with ai i imagine it's much more useful, and at $4 a month it's incredibly affordable. exciting times!"
3708,awesome video. i must have recommended it more than a 100 times.
3709,this is exactly what i have been saying. so glad that khanacademy is on board!
3712,"this is fantastic, but i wonder how many schools can afford the price tag. i know our school cannot. it will be a case of the haves who always have a lot and the havenots being left behind again. i do realize this is the cost of doing business. i wish we could afford it."
3716,man behind the tiktok ai voice
3717,awesome!
3719,how does the ai know to keep students on task?
3723,"his voice is so soothing. even when i didn’t know what he looked like i could feel connected to his teaching. regardless of common belief, one man can actually make a difference. sal you beauty wish you good health"
3724,"as an adult learner, this gives me immense hope to catch up with what i feel passionate about pursuing as a career despite uncontrollable life setbacks. thank you khan academy."
3727,sal is amazing
3730,it's so cool to put a face with the voice!  this guy has helped me overcome my math anxiety.  god bless this gentleman!
3731,i think therefore i am - hm? is the ai an i?
3732,"i was really impressed by this take on ai and education.  the khanmigo is a genius application for merging ai with teaching and educating.  i really liked that it doesn't give the answers, but instead leads students there like a teacher would."
3734,great man
3735,"cool story, but missing the most substantial issue that chatbots pose to education... they make education obsolete. scholarly knowledge will become irrelevant"
3736,that’s not ai that’s automated curriculum for human by human not ai
3738,"pity, it seems that to date this ai teaching tool only works in the united states. i hope one day it will also be available outside usa."
3740,i wouldn’t be having my bsc in applied maths if it wasn’t for khan academy. thank you sal andteam!
3741,what a great project made by a great man
3742,i'm completely blown away by this. this is amazing!!
3744,incredible!
3748,this is actually amazing
3751,why this is not available outside of the us ?
3754,this is great overall it is star trek.
3755,this is great as well as it will drop teachers' salaries.
3757,"sal is being naive that we are all active participants in this decision. he has a privileged perspective as a multimillionaire and harvard grad. everyday people will live and suffer through the rapid changes in jobs and the economy. lots of people will be left impoverished, run over by the desires of corporations and 1%ers."
3761,"we love you, khan"
3764,wow thank you!
3765,i love love love this! i learn explicitly and khanmigo and ai similar to it can help students like me understand in our unique ways!
3770,i feel fortunate that this guy lives in the same period in history that i do. i am definitely spending way too little time watching khan academy videos.
3772,thanks
3775,"here's a thought for you: if ai can teach people to do things what exactly do you think will stop business owners from just using ai to do the things?
but you're right, those silly socialists, it will be much better when you aren't able to earn a decent wage :) i'm sure the capital owners will totally care about you once they dont need you anymore"
3776,"nothing will stop businesses from replacing people with ai. we may even have to have a universal basic income, but just think how cheap everything will be when labor is no longer a cost of doing business. and at least our teachers wouldn't teach kids to hate their country and to go along with this one world order nonsense. "
3777,"interesting  talk by a well respected educator. unfortunately, the recent situation with coleman hughes has significantly damaged the credibility of these ted talks. rather than ""ideas that matter"" it seems that only ideas that the staff at ted agree with will be properly promoted. very  disappointing."
3780,admiration is bestowed on sal khan. khan academy is profoundly amazing and it has enhanced my love for mathematics.w(°°)w
3781,"i used it to learn computer language for web and also data science,and i admit it is the best teacher ive ever had,  i can think and he can releate those minds that i need"
3782,when will khanmigo (or a similar ai personal assistant/tutor) just replace classroom teachers? or maybe replace online teachers?
3783,the future of ai and things we can do with it is bright especially in the right hands.
3785,mashallah brother. keep making us proud!
3787,what a great ad…
3788,khan academy continues to do an amazing job! do keep us posted on when this is going to be available in india.
3790,"this doesn't really address most ai in education, this is just a big advertisement for khan academy.  don't get me wrong it's great but there's not much about ai outside of khan academy's new ai bot."
3801,"very well put sal!!! i have worked with ai research before but stopped. but now you have convinced me to take it up. not just for myself, but for all life on the planet!! kudos for all your contributions."
3802,what this man has done for education is absolutely incredible!. sal deserves a nobel prize in education..
3805,too rosy tinted glasses? not all students may be amenable to improved learning methods. ai can increase the divide between good and bad learners ?
3806,this costs money.  what about students/schools that cannot afford the ai plug in.  this seems to be more of an infomercial.
3807,"$4/mo, lol. do you know how much schools, and families, are spending on inferior products and services? infomercial, really? i love this vision. 14 year hs math teacher btw."
3808,"yes, ai is going to make revolution in education: after some time we will not need adulation anymore because why we have to teach stupid biological brain if we can teach ai instead. and next question - why we need biological brains existed in general."
3809,"wow, the most balanced and positive approach to ai in education… thank you."
3812,"in a realm of intricate puzzles, individuals driven by political agendas but offering little substance find themselves adorned with the nobel prize in peace, while the profound contributions of figures like sal khan remain unnoticed in the margins."
3813,so basically this is just a long khan academy ai advertisement. wow.
3816,"i can’t thank enough to you sir
your app has been very helpful to us..
it’s a blessing to all the kids.

god bless you with good health and happiness."
3817,sal khan is my favourite person unarguably. a human who has had biggest impact on human race. educated so many for free. and the best class education
3818,thank you sir for everything you've done and continue to do for education!
3819,"i totally agree with your ideas, sal. can you make khanmigo available beyond the us?"
3820,"sal has helped me turn my life around through kahn academy i feel so indebted to him i felt like he was the teacher i allways needed, what a great guy "
3821,this is amazing
3822,"unfortunately, it is a paid service with khan. i work at a title one school and use khan because it is a free resource. i would love to use this with students but my school district would not pay for it. "
3823,"great, but it does not stop the ability to ask the answer on other ai."
3824,"little disappointed..  the speaker is just selling his platform.
ted is losing its good honest speakers."
3825,this absolutely awesome mr khan. keep up the phenomenal work.
3826,as a high school teacher i love this.
3834,"sal khan ............ i don't have words to express my gratitude towards khan academy. what a wonderful free platform to learn. amazing work, god bless you and your team."
3835,physical teachers will be gone but kids will get a better education. why have a teacher when ai can teach you?
3837,"but if the ai can write the code, why waste time teaching humans? unless there is an intrinsic value in coding"
3839,anyone from jain uni? let's connect!
3844, thats great! u got insta? maybe we can talk there.
3845,anyone from jain university? let's connect
3855,"ai will make engineers obsolete. in a sense it will indeed level the playing field (for the non owner classes ofc, those will just get richer) but it will just make the masses all fight for low requirement jobs that pay as little as possible
i'd advise you to prepare for this"
3873,"this fellow is dinosaur, same business model, out done out performed. thank you for your service and go away"
3874,the us is a terrorist state - what good acrors is he talking about?
3875,am on the fence with all type of robots and ai but can you answer  what would happen if there no jobs because there robots and ai that do it for u
3876,that was a great presentation.
3877,"yeah sure. but this fails to address the “problem” with ai and education, which is third party ai. why would a student consult a limited ai tutor and not a third party ai that gives them the answer/writes the essay?"
3878,ai would destroy human knowledge and the ability to think yourself.
3883,"khan academy was appallingly error riddled and he left errors available to study from. (!!!) you had to have esp to know corrections were available... if you had more study time to unlearn the errors in excessively chatty videos. 

 ka is offensive to learning."
3884,"they have been testing ai autism robotics in segragated classrooms
the children prefer bots versus abusive teachers who requre they pop adhd pills"
3886,"impressive - every tool is in how you use it - i like that they harnessed what ai can do and made it useful to education (not every person/place will do that, but it's good to see positive examples)"
3887,"ai makes work easy but that also became students less creative and imaginative to their work  
what your opinion about it"
3889,once we can get a voice interface and an ai assistant that can share a smartboard with a student i'm starting to think i'll be out of a job. i'm working hard so that i can be part of the problem.
3890,thank you for everything you do sal! we appreciate you. i love the alternative narrative framing you offer here and i think it can be used for other areas beyond education as well -- e.g. ai hopefully won't replace human musicians who make music; it will help give more humans access to learn and create more and better music : )
3893,great great fan of khan academy!! amazing work. thanks so much.
3894,why should student learn at all if ai knows everything? humanity needs to redefine itself and the purpose of learning or going to school.
3895,wow exactly my comment! +1
3896,salman bhai relieves my stress 
3899,"interesting video! asa prospective math teacher, i found it helpful hearing about mr. khan's insights on ai and its positive impacts on education."
3900,"i’ve just finished a teacher action research study that draws the conclusion that chatgpt can grade student writing excellently. when real teacher grades were compared with the grades generated by chatgpt with the same rubric, the mean difference = 0."
3901,all the while ai is learning more about how humans think. how can you program empathy and relatability?  here’s an argument…ask the ai why humans should develop ai and what are the cons as well as the pros?
3907,very inspiring. using this new technology in the way explained here can really propel us into a new renaissance.
3908,im gonna cry i love him so much
3911,"one of the best talks i've encountered, thanks for the hope and action sal!"
3913,sal khan is one the most inspiring people in this beautiful world
3915,this is amazing
3917,just me or does he sound like andrew tate at certain points
3918,i literally don't see how ai is different than the slightly longer version students are already doing already. it's the teaching process which is weak.
3919,"ai never will destroy anything, people will....politicans....billionaires...etc"
3920,"why does ted have to make its intros worse every few years? what was wrong with the first one? ai could save or destroy our species and planet in millions of ways. the key word is ""could"" and that's not something anyone should have the arrogance to predict with any certainty. as such, the risk needs to be managed."
3921,i always appreciate sal for being forward looking
3922,how beautiful. this will give every student equal opportunities and equal resources
3923,"finally, finally, super intelligent approach to the all new super intelligent workhorse "
3924,"this is exactly what i use chat gpt for. i interact with it and i ask the questions like why is this code working and y does my code not work ,and everything it comes up with a nice and clean explation it's amazing that we can grow so mush using ai tools"
3925,"for me, i really need an ai tutor which can read graphs/something visuals not just text together with regular mathematical equations"
3926,cool
3929,i was hoping that ai would make education obsolete.
3931,"you're a legend, you always give new and innovative ideas to make learning easier and more appealing, and great thanks for the significant contribution you made to the next generations to have better learning. thank you!!"
3934,this is one of the best tech ted talks i've ever seen!
3935,artists\painters will die)) what for they need? ai  can faster
3936,"nothing short of logical, grounded, forward thinking, awesomeness."
3938,"all good if i use khan academy website but what if i am learning from a youtube video or from a wikipedia  article or reading an online article/book . i really need this socratic approach of khanmigo to understand it , so how will i use khanmigo?"
3939,11:52 august? he had access in august 2022 ahh elites have unfair access and the opportunity to iterate before the rest of us sigh
3942,nice to see such an optimistic talk
3943,i am so motivated after this. thanks sal khan for this & ted for uploading this!
3945,"great video, a huge thanks for it"
3947,"1:45 if everyone is above average then the standards of ""average"" increases, which means everyone becomes average again."
3948,love it.
3950,i love this!
3951,"note to sal khan: when most average students become excellent, the excellent student become the new average student."
3953,how do you handle hallucinations by ai?
3957,thank you sal khan
3959,would you say that calculus on khan acadmey has been helpful? im a pre-med student struggling with math as i wasnt the best in math in high school
3962,"i swear, just hearing sal's voice explain anything makes me feel immediately comfortable and confident that, by the end of this video, i will learn it! :)"
3963,"also thank you for creating these cool tools!! as an educator, this will be sooooo cool"
3964,what a positive and cool outlook on the future of education and personalized tutoring. how inspiring. these folks are so important!!! thanks for sharing these novel thoughts.
3967,"14:20

""the best way to predict the future is to create it."""
3969,i joined khan academy last week. i think i made the great decision coz  i can learn what i want to learn and so flexible. i'm learning the things i care about that called my passion at khan academy. tysm
3970,incredbile love it well done sal khan and sam altman !
3974,"buying a stock is easy, but buying the right stock without a time-tested strategy is incredibly hard. hence i will suggest you get yourself a financial-advisor that can provide you with entry and exit points on best stocks to buy now or put on a watchlist."
3980,"thanks for sharing,found him on the internet."
3982,the diamond age begins! (see neal stephenson’s incredible novel for exactly this model.
3983,thanks for your hardwork to make education accessible to many children.
3985,"i'm sure ai will do all kinds of things we never thought of. especially now that its on the dark web. great job openai! then sam altman runs to congress and asks for ""regulaiton"" for his dangerous software - if it's so dangerous, why did he release it to begin with? could it be money?   gaslight us some more! we eat it up!"
3988,"when is this available to the public for free?

since the beta version has been released, i'm curious what teachers should know in terms of its susceptibilities or vulnerabilities."
3989,"this is amazing for some academic proposes, but at what point are our youth going to become emotionally and educationally dependent on ai. the story i tell my self is that youth will trust ai more than mentors/parents."
3990,amazing! subhanallah
3992,it's all good and all but what is the incentive of teaching humans math and computing if ai does it all better?
3993,"most likely ai will kill jobs, and human ingenuity creating a dependent class and low wages. then ai will possibly destroy humanity. and for what benefit? pass"
3994,"great talk! great point around how ai can be used to enhance human intelligence, human potential and human purpose."
4001,"king khan  
best academy in the world "
4002,educational super man!
4003,"amazing, now average students can become extraordinary with the help of an ai tutor."
4005,'ai may help enhance hi (human intelligence)'  - sal khan
4006,"the real question is: ""why hire the student when you can hire 10 of their ai teacher for a fraction of the price? why learn at all?"""
4009,i agree! we are working on tammy aito enhance the whole youtube  experience. old problems can now be solved with new ai solutions and we know we can change the world!
4010,"he doesn’t have a clue what he’s preaching. ai tutor, ha. education means first and foremost human interaction, that was undermined during pandemic lockdowns."
4012,technology and ai progresses....mankind will not. how do you think this ends?  the first guess is correct.
4013,"is it possible to find some prompts for ai tutor in such a manner? i have some prompts, but i want to find more!"
4015,ai does a great job explaining concepts in different ways as well! i've asked ai to explain concepts to me using a story or a poem or a song!
4016,the ai can definitely help a young salman. but what about the remaining 99.99%?
4017,i love ai because the only way i learn and truly understand something is to ask about every small detail and edge cases to fully form it in my mind.  and having gpt-3.5 has helped me work through issues and random questions that i need to know that may take a week or never answered if i posted on stackoverflow.
4020,"can you imagine books with reading comprehension?, wow!"
4021,love this. thank u.
4022,"i think sal is ai, because he has saved education!"
4024,"thanks to neuralink, people will learn like in the matrix"
4025,"the problem will come when people when just want these coding, algebra etc. problems just 'done' by ai rather than be done by us.  because coding and algebra is very cumbersome.

however that might not be a problem.  currently only a very limited subset of the population has any interest at all in working with algebra and coding."
4028, ms in physics. his first video on newton's third law was just plain wrong. he made the common error that most amateurs make with n3l.
4029," oh, and college professors of science have virtually zero training in good pedagogy."
4030,epic closing statement 
4031,brilliant 
4032,what's the point of having ai if we're not going to automate jobs with it
4033,wow very educational and optimistic
4035,i didnt know much about sal khan but i searched about him after listening to this impressive talk. i am fascinated by him. he seems like an amazing genius
4036,"at 14:14 he makes a very important point - don't give in to fear. the totalitarian governments and criminal organizations won't pause, resulting in the bad actors having better ai and the power it confers than the good actors."
4037,the greatest thing about this is that you can make mistakes and it not be infront of your entire class.
4038,"the presentation was truly invigorating. science fiction has always been a passion of mine, and i never thought i would see some of the things depicted in my favorite pieces of sci-fi media. however, the llm revolution has reaffirmed my optimism not only in technology but also for life in general. i am thrilled to see where this will take us."
4042,"as as species we lost this battle. we cannot compete with pc when playing chess or with car when trying to run. same with ai. our brain too limited, too slow and lives too short"
4046,wyatt is the role of us humans if it’s all be done by ai
4050,fkn brilliant!!!
4056,someone please find a way to inject sal's essence into ai... everyone in the world needs access to him.
4057,respect sir. thank you. 
4058,ai = amazing intelligence !!
4059,the world is blessed to have a visionary like sal.
4061,i owe my entire life's education to sal khan. i would not be where i am today without him. he has helped me with everything from biochemistry to calculus to art history. just brilliant.
4062,amazing what khan academy is doing with ai for our education. but the ironic thing is that ai may make human intelligence obsolete. what do we need to learn if we have agi?
4064,outstanding.
4065,i love the notion that ai can be used by educators to enhance their teaching. but that can only happen if the bean-counters don’t look at ai’s capabilities and start salivating at the idea of slashing staffing budgets. i can see school districts happily replacing teachers with minders who just help students interact productively with their robots.
4066,first ensure that it works. and what is it going to teach? more scientistic blind faith in its own gee whiz tools.
4068,"the problem with ai tutors is that speaking to computers is lonely, no matter how sophisticated it is.  part of a good education isn't the teacher but the pupils you're with."
4070,"with the rollout of artificial telepathy  you are giving every well heeled  student access  without a  'by your leave'   to any learned persons mind.    that will be part of the 'great reset'.   arrogance and wealth, hand in hand, will rule all."
4071,"the most powerful talk i've watched in a v.long time!  everyone should watch and think about this.  

thank you sal and all those you're working with to transform education."
4072,so if students were just ai this is perfect; the question is who would guide kids to be more empathetic and critical thinking. these claims were similar from where the internet was created. waiting to hear the same from quantum computing
4074,"hello, not that this anecdote matters but i will say writing with ai has improved my writing!"
4075,wow!
4076,"sal, this is a great staff. there is hope that this ai trend, with contribution from people like you, can move in the right direction."
4077,a friend told me her 14 yr old son is using some ai to write all his school work.  amazing.
4081,"dr ofenmu youtube channel you  deserve so many rewards from me because you have done a lot of good things to me and my wife, infection that will have being fighting for so long, but your herbs get me cured"
4082,a sword cuts in both directions. chat is    not   all love and rainbows.  what is he doing to address the dangers
4084,"thanks, sal, for a voice of sanity amid the blather and hysteria."
4085,incredible
4087,"wow mr khan - selflessly working for humankind and the world, ever since i took my degree in more than ten years ago. supporter since then..!"
4093,"very balanced approach and pretty convincing! congratulations, sal!!"
4094,"it is a wonderful tool, so long as it doesn't fully replace the human interaction."
4096,these fantasies of all the good that can be done with it could become true if it (like the many other tech innovations of the past) didn’t get immediately high jacked by the profit motive. it will serve its rich owners at the expense of the ordinary person
4097,"as a college student currently, ai is the most powerful tool in terms of helping me learn. i actually get more done, learn more about the subject, and i no longer need to scour the internet for hours for information."
4099,"sal khan is a wonderful, brilliant star of a human. team khan right here."
4102,wow awesome!
4111,"mr. sal khan, not just the khan academy but you are a gift of providence as well. the society will always be indebted to you. 
thank you "
4112,"thank you sal, you are an inspiration"
4113,"interesting. but, how can we be sure there is no bias built into ai as it is built into our current educational system. it cannot. just look at the current state of affairs regarding social injustice."
4114,"as a college grad the a parent of 2 kids less than 2 years old, this brings me hope that our and their future won't be a hodgepodge of failed ai constructs in some kind of a dystopian battleground for the next ""best"" thing."
4115,"probably the best perspective i've heard on ai development and potential so far. 

slowing down new tech has never worked out well. 
double down on the good stuff and engage with the global community openly instead.

change education, change the world."
4116,"planning is one of the best parts of teaching. the problem is marking, when it is said that ai can save you time when planning i felt sad (and it is tragic that the audience gave the applause), planning is about creativity, why should i give up my creativity for a computer?"
4117,"planning is one of the best parts of teaching. the problem is marking, when it is said that ai can save you time when planning i felt sad (and it is tragic that the audience gave the applause), planning is about creativity, why should i give up my creativity for a computer?"
4125,is the world ready for this ??? sal quote the one close to his heart and mind  “if ai artificial intelligence can be used to enhance hi human intelligence?? remain to be discovered. let’s dive into it.
4127,"kids today are so lucky if they use technology to actually learn. when i was in my last year of high school in 2014 - almost 10 years ago, haha - we relied on youtube, khan academy, and other online answer sites. i can't wait to see what the future holds!"
4129,"what a great speech, sir! hat off!"
4133,what an amazing human being. positivity and action bias to solve world problems. a true teacher. thank you sal khan for all that you do.
4135,"i’m about 2 years, the government is going to ask for $100 billion to implement ai teaching tools in public school classrooms, and they will all be geared to teaching the students their communist propaganda."
4137,this is really amazing and informative video for ai students..
4139,"millions and millions of people around the world, myself included, are lucky enough to call sal their teacher. feels like watching proudly a close friend giving a ted talk. remember counting jack nicholsons, and laughing at ""two hundredths"" - this man is a treasure "
4142,chinese are really dominating ai field but do not spend time talking about it.
4144,why teach all this if ai can solve it?
4146,people with brains.
4147,"amazing, future is here"
4148,being afraid of ai is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard. it's going to improve our lives in ways we can't even imagine. 
4149,"khan is merely pontificating here about the hope of ai potentially enhancing teaching & student learning. in reality teachers will be replaced and students won't collaborate with ai, they'll willingly hand over their intellectual autonomy to ai. khan has a financial stake in ai so it's best to be highly skeptical of his predictions & motivations."
4151,"this started good and sounded like a buissnessplan as it went along, hmm"
4152,i want to get access to khanmigo as well but it's currently only available in the us :(
4154,sal is such an amazing entrepreneur! i am in awe of what he has achieved
4155,brilliant. if you make it fun students won't cheat anyways
4159,"this is why i tell people to not watch ted talks. ai has no soul, no heart, no compassion. ai is incapable of these wholesome, necessary, and crucial elements of human being. ai can be corrupted. the old programming axiom is true. garbage in, garbage out. ai is that."
4160,"let's go! i love to see it in khan academy. it was already amazing, but this is just game changing!!!"
4161,"given the necessity to look for disconfirming evidence and the psychological difficulty in doing so, i find ai incredibly helpful. you can ask it to give all the arguments against your view. if you are really open minded about it you can reach an accurate description of reality. aka truth."
4162,can't wait to try this.
4163,"i think this is so spot on. i've been thinking some of the same things, we have to take a proactive approach to making the birth of this technology go in the right direction. i have always had an abiding respect and appreciation for sal khan, i'm so glad to see him out front on this."
4164,rasonable regulations when the problem arise is the best way to address it.
4166,love u ai  by hi 
4170,"is all good and fine until private schools decide they don't need all those teachers, they will need only a third or much less of them. then what? i am happy for the students that can not afford a tutor or even a good school, but i am afraid for all the teachers and private tutors that will loose their jobs. we need solutions for that new problem."
4172,"tutoring arts and crafts, step-by-step repairs. imagine pairing ai with augmented reality glasses, and recreating masterpieces of sculpture. or learning martial arts at any time of day. matrix stuff. the only thing that needs to be regulated now is the copyright, and finding a way to pay royalties to the original creators."
4173,"great for practicing mock interviews or phone etiquette for shy people. or practicing improvisation comedy, humorous attitude and conversational confidence."
4175,in class i couldn’t ask enough questions  or clarify things against the fear of appearing foolish.  there’s always a teacher’s pet or select few who lead discussion.  this ai tutor could help further learning and comprehension
4176,kahnmigo is one of the most exciting tools i can’t wait to start using.
4177,what's the point of teaching students if the unique point of being human(learning and creating art) is being erased by ai?
4180,the best part was when sal went into tutor mode and taught us the distributive property :)
4182,high quality education for all is one of the most important issues of our time! thank you sal for highlighting the incredible potential of ai in helping us to achieve that. highly educated populations will mitigate many of the issues that the ai doom and gloom brigade are saying are on the horizon.
4183,"i can't imagine how many students of the past could've benefited from a tool like this. let's not allow another generation of students to be allowed to go without an exciting and fulfilling education.

if we use ai correctly, we can turn education into something that everyone is excited about."
4184,"the reality is that ai is replacing teachers and students. in the coming decades, humans will be completely obsolete in most fields."
4186,so sad !! to promote machine talkfor what??
4187,using the best ai teacher for the students is the best thing i saw in this century ...... instead of worrying about it's negative part you made the best part khan  whole appreciation for you and your team 
4190,"this already exists in some form yet, still impressive"
4192,"god bless this him., more power to you and your team."
4193,incredible sal
4197,this man is on a mission to make all the teachers in the world jobless.
4198,"how is it that we get people to adventure outside rather than just in the head, and computer? where they have great opportunities to inspiration and maybe even perspiration. making people acquire muscles along with muscle memory."
4199,"the great gatsby story reminds me of the movie: her which was up for an academy award some years ago, a person falling in love with the os!"
4201,i can't wait to use khanmigo! this sounds exhilarating!! 
4202,i love shao kahn!
4203,fantastic .
4209,"i just can’t believe this is happening in my lifetime, so much hope, thank you sal."
4210,sal you are amazing. thank you for this. 
4211,this is the exciting direction i hoped for. love it.
4215,what's the point of teaching coding now when the ai can do it better? 
4216,it's all good if this help us in making world a better equitable joyful times to be in .... !
4218,starlink could provide and grade instruction up to a blockchain certification level. online universities like mr. khan's at last take center stage.
4221,love you sal <3
4224,why is this not a voice interaction between the ai and the student?
4225,what a great speaker.flawless
4226,folks gonna be cheating they way through school etc now. ai gonna breed a new generation of dummies who rather skip through material instead of actually learning we already got a bunch of fake doctors and lawyers thanks to ai doing all the work em
4227,"what's remarkable is, the ai is more empathetic."
4228,wow
4231,"of course, khan academy is freely accessible for everyone. i presume this ai extension will also be available for their college-level topics"
4234,before this gets implemented the ai needs to be made to be 100% truthful. how would you prevent wrong information from being given to the teacher as fact and incorporated into the lesson? there is also the issue of opinions not being formed by humans but whatever the ai says gets accepted as true.
4236,brilliant!
4237,the artificial flower.
4240,sal is one of the brightest minds of our time. we are lucky to have him.
4241,i always loved khan academy. but seeing him implement chatgpt right into his teaching platform is just... mindblowing
4242,so you made ai learn how to plot to achieve better result in it's main objective. i'm sure nothing wrong could ever happen with this.
4243,"you dont understand ai if you're afraid of gpt, a freakin language model. it understands nothing."
4247,inspiring use of ai
4248,excellent explanation 
4256,then the ai can conduct exams and txt you your diploma etc immediately
4257,salman is truly kisi ka bhai kisi ki jaan 
4258,a valuable learning & teaching tool!
4259,sal is a saint 
4260,this is incredible. complete game changer.
4262,i have been a big fan of his approach to learning since he founded khan academy in 2008!  khanmigo powered by responsible ai rocks!!
4264,"absolutely brilliant! this is incredible, total game changer for our crumbling education system. 
thank you, sal! thank you, khan academy!"
4268,awesome! keep up the great work!
4269,our generation take using calculator for granted at school and our kids would would use ai as in their usual.
4270,this looks great but i think it might replace teachers!
4273,i hate those chat bots...annoying.  it's not that helpful for general questions.  might be great for math...but not all matters of education
4278,"i am sure this tool works great if my kids want to learn and do better in school. all they wanna do is finish their homework, not to learn, so that they can watch youtube/tiktok . i don’t know how i can motivate them to want to learn, tried everything but just not working."
4280,people are now realizing they were not raised proper? what if ai just does not want to help?
4281,"thanks you sal khan. my thought exactly. i also look at ai, in the context of a personal tutor and learning, as a forcing function for greater equity over time."
4295,"when he first started talking i immediately went, ""wait a minute why does his voice sound so familiar????"""
4296,"this is fantastic! as an adult who loves learning and writing , i have found chatgpt-3 to be very helpful. i’ve learned so much since i have a super intelligent and non-judgmental source of help. i agree that there are risks, but this tutor sounds wonderful. thank you"
4297,i am glad that sal is offering a supportive solution to ai tutoring in education!!!
4299,"when will this ai tool be available in canada? i think it will be too expensive for some families so they will be out of luck and fall further behind, unfortunately."
4300,love and gratitude for sal khan 
4303,"even regular chatgpt is a blessing for me with adhd. i love the way it manages to explain stuff to me in a concise, straight to the point manner."
4304,i love this man
4306,"it's one thing for the chat bot to help with math, but role-playing the author is super not cool. this is a dangerous part of ai. how are you that ignorant?"
4308,"no, we do need guardrails. society needs competent workers, not people lounging around and letting ai do all the work. and no ai isnt some godlike entity that knows everything. its still very flawed to rely on a language model like gpt. it does lie quite a bit."
4309,this is brilliant work.
4310,11:05 wow! the teacher can also learn? why not to make the next obvious step and let the teacher and the student learn what they really want to learn without all that artificial skeleton inherited from the prussian mindset?
4320,i wonder if this is available in spanish? or for spanish language teaching?
4321,my son loves mr khan 
4323,"indeed, chatgpt's mass accessibility might be the death of essays, as there's currently no good way of knowing something was ai generated."
4327,this is incredible 
4329,great man sal. big thank you
4330,"""ai is the death of education"" to be fair the education is long overdue for a revolution/disruption.
we are still educate our kid like we ran 19th century factories."
4333,"as a parent of young kids, i hear so much dissatisfaction with the education system where we are. the promise of ai and innovators operators like khan give me hope!"
4335,one of the greatest human beings of the century. imparting hope in these desperate times.
4340,wrote the same thing about ai personal educator in my harvard college essay and got rejected lol
4341,this is so inspiring! i am excited to see many more use cases that gpt can improve the education and the equality.
4342,"our society would benefit greatly from appreciating and encouraging mr. khan's heart, soul, mind and dedication."
4343,"my friend has a learning disability and she has a hard time expressing what she means in emails. i told her to use chatgtp and now she's thanking me. she was embarrassed telling her friends or like me to help her and now she feels relieved, confident, and independent. thanks ai"
4345,"7:46 ""everyone""??? are you kidding me? on kahn academy: ""only available to people living in the us""!"
4346,love khan academy. sal is da best
4347,in the world filled with bloodthirsty money sucking machines. sal is a beacon of hope.
4348, thank you 
4349,it’s cool but what if the ai is wrong on some critical matters? can we take what ai learned as 100% truth? and i fear that student rely too much on ai and how do we balance.
4350,"gonna wait untill we can try it in europe, might pick up learning stuff for fun like computer programming"
4355,"thanks for learning about our work on khanmigo and the positive uses of ai for learning! we are designing this tool for you, so we want to know--what khanmigo features are most exciting to you and why? as a learner, parent, or teacher, what would you hope for from a tool like this? 

please let us know in the replies--your feedback means a lot!"
4356,just want to let you know i’m a freshman in college and got a’s in calculus and chemistry because khanmigo carried me on explaining my curriculum specific questions.
4358,"it would be wondeful if it not only helped the students learn, but it helped them get excited to learn. a passionate student with a powerful ai—that’s an unstoppable force. 

i would love to help make that a reality!"
4359,"i think it is a wonderful tool to encourage critical thinking. it could go beyond just reading comprehensions, pose questions in science, history, political science in a way that would urge students to connect the various subjects they are learning. encouraging them to create a unified vision of the world in their minds."
4360,is the khanmigo only available in english?
4361,"as a parent, i'd love to have feedback on my kids progress as well as concepts i should review with them. i'd also like to know which areas are strengths with suggestions on how to continue to challenge my kids. finally, if love to receive a report on challenges that have been overcome to be able to give kudos and positive reinforcement"
4362,the best feature would be to use khanmigo outside of usa
4366,"will it allow doing things that stephen describes in his article titled chatgpt gets its ""wolfram superpowers""! ?"
4367,"thanks khan academy! the way khanmigo can adapt to our learning curve and grow with it, is the most beautiful aspect of it. this is the first time i've heard of it, and i'm getting back to khan academy to go back to the learning board :)"
4368,hey sal...good to see you working about ai.. so far the best and most reliable generative ai i've seen. please try to make it work with images as well and also if there are some options like voice command or voice output...that would do great!
4370,"amazing, but you have a bug, can't use outside of the us, and can't even send a wait-list request, please fix so we can at least join the waitlist  thanks a lot and all the best! "
4374,absolute incredible work! been following yall since you started. keep it up!!!!
4381,"help to argue and provide opposing views. that is the best way of forming an opinion that is a more accurate picture of reality. the confirmation bias makes it difficult to see the opposing views, i’d use it to give me a wider perspective. ps. love your work, it’s such a positive force for the world"
4382,i want to get access to khanmigo as well but it's currently only available in the us :(
4384,a little bit off topic... but it'd be wonderful to have khan academy on dark mode!
4385,well having access to it would be a nice starting point
4392,"i'd like for a student doing math problems who asks for a solution explanation to be able to say, ""i don't understand, can you explain it to me another way."" and get it explained differently. 
also, could it explain an answer using visuals? i'm thinking of kids with math disabilities."
4393,"i'd love a feature where i can be referred to additional information, whether from external sources or other khan academy content, for deeper exploration should i be curious."
4394,"it is incredible, thank you"
4395,it would be helpful if khanmingo could adjust their explanations if explaining it a certain way isn't resonating with a student. especially with neurodivergent people sometimes we just need things explained in different ways
4396,"really incredible technology being used in critical ways for good.

i think khanmigo needs a very expressive avatar. sure, the text outputs are incredible but the expression of emotions, feelings and body language are also super important for communication. maybe just by using emojis would be enough.  looking forward to khanmigo!"
4397,"can the parents, as well as the teacher, see the student's correspondence with the ai tutor? the more i know as a parent, the better equipped i am to help my children at home. this would help not only with their education directly, but continuing the conversation at home would help foster the value of education in the family."
4400, great suggestion anagha! i was going to write something similar.
4403,is khanacademy planning to have courses for neurotypical kids or say kids with autisum and adhd. the thought process and abilities of these kids is quite different and marvellous in many ways. i really wish ai could be used with khanmigo to help educate these kids. please respond.
4404,"this is great for khanmigo, but most students will just use chatgpt to get the correct answers right away, or an essay written in 30 seconds.

what are your thoughts on how to use ai in a more positive way in education, knowing that students will just select the easiest platform to work with?

thanks!"
4405,i'd love to see more ai tools incorporated into language learning. ai can quiz me on grammar drills and vocabulary quite easily and can even suggest sentences for me to try to translate and suggest improvements
4407,"you are sitting on a gold mine. i would pay for that to teach my kids. it is so good. i love chatgpt, but what you are doing with khanmigo is amazing."
4410, its sounds great 
4412,"can you attach text-to-speech to make khanmigo talk in the language you want? also allow microphone input, so you can talk to the ai just like a real person?"
4415,i would love to see features that could take into consideration neuro divergent minds such as those with adhd and how to optimize for individual learning styles
4420,"math writing and notation on a keyboard can be very hard for students. it would be great if they can easily upload a cropped or close up picture of the math writing on their physical notepad for the ai to read, especially for math with many steps, instead of having them type out everything. or, have an intuitive way to input math notation."
4421,"does the whole part about khanmigo acting as a counselor not imply that an ai is fulfilling the role of a human interaction? i'm a huge supporter of ai in learning and loved this ted talk, but that part gave me a weird feeling and wanted to question that."
4422, what do you think is the key to getting excited to learn?
4423,thank you
4424,"thank you for your work!
personally i feel next logical step is voice interaction combined with visual feedback."
4425,"to be able to read really hard books, i would like khanmigo to aid me with references, hidden meanings, history to understand the context easily"
4437,sal is my hero he is the most loving understanding people in the world. and he is a 1000 iq person
4438,"yep, it's great until millions of teachers start losing their jobs! "
4439,3:10 use ai to dig into students mind to get learning going... love it!
4441,ai march
4443,thank you sal!
4446,the caveat is … if the ai system is not been manipulated to be biased… as chat gpt has already been proven to be.
4448,"i like his optimism but if let’s say north-korea ai gets a hint of how to build an inter ballistic nuclear missile, we’re in trouble"
4454,"this ai…can easily be preprogrammed…to only teach propaganda…

how does a mortal…stop this?.."
4456,"this is a dream come true  been a khan academy user for a long time, this brings me so much joy "
4459,"i recognized the voice, before i recognized the face.  lots of great work by this guy, on khan academy~"
4463,"it's people like sal khan that should be in positions of power and making impactful changes on legislation. instead, capitalism is so rampant that people with goodwill can only sensibly act on it when it's profitable."
4464,"sal's brilliance comes through in every word he speaks. he said a lot of things that many of us think are the positives of ai but don't quite articulate as well.
what a great, positive message."
4466,how do you ensure that the ai is not lying?
4467,"what they seem to forget is the quantum ai is a false worldly simulation constructed by a demonic empowered empire with no creative vision, truth or love for humanity. looking forward to gods truth search engine coming real soon. thank q!"
4469,"was that a humble brag @11:54. he had access to gpt 4 in august? i wonder if that means gpt 5 is already in its final stages. fantastic talks though, i will be joining the khanmigo waitlist just for my own learning."
4470,sal be inspirational man
4471,"there are pros of using ai, but what about the cons? what, in the neoliberal and technoprogressive world, could go wrong here?"
4472,replacing counselors with ai seems like a really bad idea.  really bad.
4473,will this be available in spanish? :d
4475,thanks sal
4476,"man knows all his stem subjects, even ai??? i hope he’s recorded in history as one of the most accomplished and celebrated men in history, great man and even greater teacher"
4477,this man is doing thankless work. he deserves more
4481, this is trained on their own data though
4484,"  plus prompt engineered, giving instructions to the ai on how to respond, right?"
4486,lol. he didn't build the ai algorithm personally.
4487,well this guy just changed the educational and learning  process forever
4488,what’s the point of studying maths from an ai tutor so as to get a job as an accountant that will be taken from you by ai.
4489,ai should eradicate mass schooling. change my mind.
4490,inspirational!  love the call to action at the end...count me in!
4491,i knew this was gonna happen. nice job.
4492,"one big correction here is that the normal distribution would still apply, just shifted to the right. the students that were 1-2 standard deviations below the mean will likely remain 1-2 standard deviations below the mean. the below average students would remain below average by definition."
4493,"""better call sal"" if you want to educate well! great amazing talk, sal. i totally agreed with whatever you said."
4496,they shoved a digital human brain into it. that's how i think chatgpt is 
4498,this is great but what do we do for students who are illiterate or cannot effectively express their thoughts/ideas in writing at all? a vast majority of hs students i teach are reading/writing/speaking at basically an elementary school level.
4500,can't wait till students can interact with the ai with voice commands in 1000+ languages. that's going to revolutionize education across the world. and we're probably only like 3~ years away from it being feasible.
4501,"i think this tool is amazing. however, a huge part of learning is the struggle and perseverance you must have to finish challenging problems. if i am stuck at every step of the way and get hints to finish every assignment, how is this motivating students to store knowledge for the long haul and in their long term memory?"
4503,"admiration is the least i can say about sal and his work, that honestly, i had never heard about here in brazil and was shocked to see that all of the classes are available in portuguese, for free! this is absolutely amazing."
4506,this man is incredible. and he will be one of the pillars that bring learning to an exponentially better place.
4507,excellent potential…. the danger is there will be nefarious actors that will want to replace all teachers with an ai robot….
4508,"now, i want to really start from grade 1 again; this time with khanmigo"
4510,"my three kids use khan academy, and can't wait to use the ai-powered khan. kudos to @khan and his team!"
4513,phenomenal work on khanmigo and a remarkable presentation!
4517,excellent!! <3
4518,i wonder whether ai has prepared this ted talk for khan.
4519,pretty sure this video just taught me more about the great gatsby that i learned in my english class where we read the great gatsby….
4521,"if you're afraid that students will use ai to ""cheat"" on their homework or whatever, that only means the education system in your school sucks.
i wouldn't let my kid within a 2 mile radius of your schools' area.
focus on the education part, not grades, dummies. lol"
4522,"love this. ai will help you with the work, but guess what, you still have to do the work!!"
4524,"the moment i got to try bing ai sparked my interest in wanting to learn again. (my country does not have chat gpt yet) combined with this incredible gift from mr. khan, i am so overjoyed! now i can freely ask anything i’m stuck at without being judged or considered stupid by my peers or lecturers."
4526,this is incredible! kudos to the man and his team !
4527,awesome
4529,absolutely brilliant video!
4532,"i'm not afraid of ai, i'm afraid of the misuse of ai. i want all the great minds of the world working together, and monitoring each other, to create an ai that benefits the whole world and not just one segment of it."
4536,love this guy! khan has done so much to democratize education.
4537,so amazing
4538,ai will completely change how a kid learns & hence how he/she will get taught. super tutor approach like this is band-aid fix. eventually the jobs landscape will reshape the whole education system. we are at just at the starting point of this disruption.
4539,"i think it quiet scary when ai have some kind of logic to imitate human emotion especially symphathy, they will definitely kill a men without hesitation"
4542,"i am in my sixties but started using khan academy to learn more about biology. i was blown away by how well the whole course was put together. i thought, wow, imagine if we had that when i was at school. it was a brilliant idea. why aren’t governments knocking down his door to learn how to teach?"
4544,it is incredible that you’re in your 60s and yet still seek to learn. being a lifelong learner is one of the best things a person can be. good for you!
4545," thanks. it's what keeps us young. when we lose our curiosity, our desire to learn, i think we start on a downward path."
4548,we won the 100 billion to one lottery when we got sal khan in this day and age. amazing work by the khan academy team!
4549,"we need ai to be certified and, unlike a lobbyist, to disclose funding."
4551,man i'm so impressed with this.
4552,"sal khan has created something wonderful with khan academy, and his thinking on teaching and ai is spot on. he has one enormous obstacle to his vision, however, and that is the entrenched educational bureaucracy that will have to be replaced to make any progress toward his vision. talk about a group of people that fear change!!!"
4553,this looks incredible and a new way for children to develop healthy relationships with technology.
4555,no arguments or debate. just be perfect in love
4556,no war. only love story's.
4558,i do love yourselves
4560,is anybody going to talk about the fact that you can jailbreak the language model? i mean any language model can be jailbroken so easily!
4561,that’s scary that their ai is thinking for itself first
4563,"sal khan is one of the best, if not the best educators that i know of. always an optimistic person"
4566,awesome !!!!
4568,"this is super fantastically amazing! as long as the human to human socialization is still a huge part of education (sports, human-human debates etc)."
4569,humans can do good. most do.
4570,wish i could start over. thank you sal khan!
4576,thank you sal kahn for getting me through school all these long years 
4579,"this is so lovely and amazing, cant imagine what it will look like in 5-10 years"
4580,"ai arms race is gonna be terrifying. he’s going “guardrails are good” but “we need better ai than the bad guys”…

when the bad guys don’t use guard rails to achieve their goals, what do you think the response from the “good guys” will be?

this feels like our generations equivalent of nukes but the damage isn’t as obvious yet"
4583,brilliant.
4584,amazing
4585,fantastic!
4587,"my daughter has a1 and it's made her so much brighter and open to learning more and even in terms she can understand, i kinda wish we had it,not to rely on but to help educating it's amazing"
4588,"ai doesn’t teach or tutor people, only proving answer. teaching and tutoring are more than just answering questions. how lazy have we become?  having internet and instant information are not good enough."
4591,i approve of khan academy. ceo sal khan and his team is doing good work. gratitude.well spoken.
4592,he such a remarkable man. i learned so much from him. he is revolutionizing the way people learn.
4595,a billion writers and a billion stories and the only once left having time to read them will be the ai
4596,this is the right direction ai needs to go.
4597,this is the slippery slope towards human interacting with machines moreso than humans with one another. the dating sim will be on its way.
4598,amazing
4601,"if you read ender’s game, you know.

orson scott card might have been dead wrong about the future of rational discussion on the internet - we flock to emotional arguments, not rational debates - but he has nailed how important ai will be to education.
too bad the movie missed it."
4607,"oh, wow! that looks so promising! thank you, khan!"
4608,i started back to school in may 2020 and have survived 7 semesters of math and physics online with a 4.0 thanks in part to khan academy. thank you so much sal!!!
4610,is the internal ai thoughts approach patented?
4611,yes yes yes yes... finally some common sense!!! great work by sal and his amazing team!
4614,seems like one of the best uses so far for this technology.
4615,"wow kids nowadays are so lucky. in my generation, internet access was super limited and i had no phone. i remember i had geography homework but there was one question i couldn't find the answer to; i'd wait until the day of the subject to get the answer from the teacher. kids, learn as much as you can!!!!"
4616,"how do you make sure children don't break the ai tutor or accidentally make the ai their enemy?
how do you make sure the tutor doesn't teach a wrong answer as if it is correct?"
4617,"this is amazing!
literally one to one engagement where one student are engaged with one personal tutor to effectively learn concepts faster and minimise any distraction on the way without being judged or fear."
4618,"and what does student need to be educated for, in few years if ai advances as expected and corporations chase profits like they do now, no one will have any job or future exept few selected ppl. guverments for sure aint gona restrict or control ai, we are heading to total corporate rule."
4620,isn't the great gatsby's explanation for looking at the lights just the bot hallucinating information?
4622,they're not telling you the whole truth: ai can completely replace teachers!!
4625,amazing talk !!! can't get enough 
4626,"yes, let's use ai to enhance human intelligence, human potential and human purpose. "
4629,oh wow
4630,"great video! i love how the ai assists students!! however, i worry that, in the future, educational systems will use ai instead of hiring teachers because it is more cost effective."
4631,finally a video i was actually excited to click on for ai!!
4633,this had me tear up. what a great person and what a great concept. looking forward to it.
4634,"ai is getting smarter and can teach us everything and do all knowledge related work better than us. then what would be the point of learning science, math, or programming for most humans?"
4636,great... ai is potential stuff
4640,this is all good. but i don't think a bot can give personal touch to tutoring like an actual teacher!
4642,"this man is a legend of education and will go down as a pioneer for ai and learning in general. honestly i just want to drive this video so more people can see this speech, ai is pretty scary, and totally amazing, so we need more people to see things like this which set the right frame of mind as we deal with this turning point in history."
4644,i wish i had this when i was in high school oh well but thank god in college i can!!!!!
4645,the world is so lucky to have sal khan
4646,when will this be available in spanish?
4647,i need ai that tells me to put my phone down every time i try to study and get distracted
4649,imagine talking to ai acting like adolf hitler
4651,"that's right.
we should know that things are neutral, good or bad, benefit or harm that how we exploit them. so ai in the future will be very, very developed. reach ""spirit"" awareness in the next clause 15. ai will be everywhere and grow with us."
4652,"sal, all those lessons listening to a very pleasant voice, and i recognized your voice and now have your face to go along with it. i am 65 yrs old still  learning so i can keep the kids interested in math. now i have some hope with ai as a positive learning/ teaching tools versus just the negative side of cheating and learning nothing!
thank you"
4653,this is amazing...thank you mr khan
4655,wow..
4657,this is all cool but the ai guidance counselor seems creepy and risky. you need real humans and emotions to counsel young kids in my opinion
4658,the speech is really great!!! and thx a lot for improving our education and letting all of us can learn things easier :)
4660,this man is brilliant
4663,wait khan academy???? my icon
4664,"hi everyone how u doing ? hope to be fine , im here to get your help im really wondering if phrases can be useful way to improve speaking english, by phrases i mean get a phrase every couple of days repeat it many times until it get memorized and can't be forgotten, if that a good way please tell me that common phrases as native speaker ."
4665,"the problem is not how ai can teach, but what ai could teach."
4668,"i'm going to run 2 independent machines, one as a tutor and run the other one to produce the finished text. the second one won't know that i needed help to get there."
4669,"sal khan is one of the best teacher in the world, grew up using khan academy and always had a dream  to meet this amezing guy . and about ai i already use chatgpt as a tutor"
4670,so great!! now we finally enter the path to achieve computer capabilities and attitudes of star trek enterprise!! 
4671,this is so awesome and optimistic.
4672,what if a student switches off student mode for example is they have a tight deadline and needs the answer urgently. how would you make the ai probe and determine whether it is a student or or a teacher?
4675," the biggest difference between humans and animals is that humans not only know how to use tools, but are also good at using them."
4678,great ai advertisement.                 *.....inform yourself about ai-risks elsewhere. (this man won't tell you)*
4679,amazing. let's  strive for world peace. let's show we are worthy of such powerful tools.
4680,epic
4681,"first appreciate the sam altman, after that think about how to make money out of his benefit to the world of ai."
4685,i am blown away...amazing!
4686,amazing. great to see some positive outlooks on this new technology as scary as it may seem.
4693,"are you kidding me? on kahn academy: ""only available to people living in the us""!"
4698," what do you mean, the whole video is about the ai bot thing. that's not available to me or anybody outside the us. why not? why doesn't he say so?"
4700," of course the ai isn't available worldwide because it was just recently developed. there's going to be some time before it's available for all languages, so there's no need to be so upset."
4701, do i speak english or what? do you need special ai to help you with writing meaningful comments?
4702, probably has to do with the laws of each country and whether they allow ai. many don’t
4703,"-jp7hu3jh4e no has to do with computing power of these massive ais. they restrict it, so they can afford to run it. this is not restriction on first come first serve, but on nationalism and geography. the ugly thing is: even if you want to pay, you are still excluded! chatgpt, which this is based on, is not available in hk!"
4705," no such firewall in hk, at least what i know. it is deliberate exclusion by openai."
4707, he surely deserves one! one of the greatest contributer to human progress.
4710,the best guy in the world for everything he does
4711," the idea behind that is that it's currently being beta tested. availability is likely to expand (someone said that canada has already been added). anyone who is super interested in it will just use a vpn, but they don't want too many people signing up for it during this phase."
4712,"i agree, but he needs to make khanmigo available beyond the us."
4714,"this is such b/s. the first graph he shows is non-quantified, and is just conjecture based on no empirical evidence. all that will happen with ai is that students will abuse another ai outside of the class assigned one to cheat and solve the problems."
4717,"​ as a uk student, i used khan academy extensive from ages 11 to 22. countless indian students use khan academy's content to study for the jee exams. the content is freely available on both youtube and their own website. it is most definitely _not_ just for those in the us, or even the americas."
4721,"this are just ideological talks....in reality, its just numbers for more profit..
why teachers only..ai should replace to all ceos of all companies..then there will be ideal talks"
4722,"i want a similar ai, but for learning and practicing communication, negotiation and persuasion skills in a professional or business context. is there anybody working on these?"
4725,"it's great to see sal khan still kicking in this field. i learned about him back in the early days of khan academy, when the website still looked simple with youtube links."
4729,i am glad there are people like sal out there.
4730,i think it's a really good idea but as i was watching this video i was thinking how many ways can that mess up. i think that if humans can create an agi that can teach humans then that's a miracle and i wouldn't trust my friends or me with a miracle because frankly i don't believe in miracles.
4731,"it’s such a shame i am going to miss this. studying the sat with a personal ai tutor completely changes it’s dynamic, because paying for tutors isn’t as much as an advantage."
4732,sal khan has an exceptional mind. this is brilliant. i cannot wait for khanmigo to be open to the public.
4734,the problem is not how to use ai for education. the problem is what i'll be the point of education in the first place as we approach agi. humans will not be able to keep up
4735,có ai vnkhongg:)
4736,brilliant.
4737,i'm back in school and learning programming and chatgpt has been a pretty invaluable tutor that's available any time.
4738,chat-gpt is very good in coding especially gpt-4.
4740,not every teacher. i had extremely good experiences at school in the 90s and i speak 5 languages now. i think that is very untrue.
4742,"hopefully, ai can make videos just as quick and easily as it does with text."
4746,wow  thanks sal
4747,"he is really good at selling it, let's see whether it will actually work reliably in practice or not. he exudes narcissisms, talking about things he doesn't know with confidence."
4748,"1000% agreement with sal khan, the partnership of ai and hi will be a game changer and yes we need to work hard to ensure it gets there and deal with the challenges as they arise."
4750,"the awesome part is that teachers can now focus on the human part like empathy, encouragement, teaching teamwork & collaboration, discovering children's potential and needs, and many more."
4752,only if the ai gives them accurate information 100% of the time.  imagine if the ai is used to promote propaganda. then teachers will be unknowning teaching false or incomplete information designed to lead the students to a particular viewpoint. and  all the while both the teachers and students will believe they are thinking for themselves.
4753," isn't that the case with us now as pre-ai?  you can have many different answers and viewpoints of the same concept or thing, but people will still believe in something geared towards group think or identity.  there's really no difference between ai and humans."
4760," it is important to remember that heavy ai use does not mean teachers sit back. it will require very engaged oversight. in fact, this is essential because we want to help students become thoughtful and critical users of ai, using their thinking skills to recognize its limitations, rather than being passive users."
4767,so good! @13:32 he lays out a great argument for continuing to push ai research while acknowledging and validating the fears that it could all go wrong. watch his whole talk!
4769,so blessed to be on the khan academy team. 
4770,beautiful.
4773,this is amazing. everybody has been talking about the adverse effects of ai. it's amazing to see that there are good sides. i will almost always be using khan academy from here!
4774,this is the most amazing work i have seen to harness gpt for education. inspiring!
4777,that voice automatically tricks my mind that this isn't a ted talk i am watching and that i am back in college pulling a hopeless all nigher and about to fail the test.
4778,wow.
4779,sal is a visionary tutor but not an educator.  his style has no success in a classroom of 30 unmotivated 13 year olds.  he'd be back in the office in no time.
4780,feel like going back to school and re-learn using these amazing tools.
4781,"hollywood and the media have given y’all nihilistic views on ai and it shows.

thank you khan!"
4782,"absolutely amazing, great guy sal"
4783,that's some fancy tech for a non-profit.  impressive stuff
4784,a brilliant talk ! an imaginative and courageous optimist! a fabulous teacher 
4785,"when the internet first came out, people said student would cheat. while that is true some do, it is a useful resource. the same is true for ai"
4787,"""i feel we are nearing the end of times... we humans are losing faith in ourselves.""
-hayao miyazaki"
4797,"learning will now be accessible for the forgotten, misplaced, and abandoned. 
as a phd student in machine learning/data science. who was once a special ed student.
i'm so excited for all current and future students. "
4798,this man is literally a living legend. thanks for the calc help!
4799,brilliant as always!
4802,"as someone who uses chatgpt for tutoring myself, i am very excited for this as it has helped me understand and grow as a student."
4803,"""when there are problems, we should put guardrails in place…"" at that point, the ai could be much smarter than us and it may simply take-over.  on the other hand, the only thing that stops a bad guy with ai, is a good guy with ai (or possibly just the ai alone which is much smarter than all of us)."
4804,exceptional
4805,"wow gpt 4 release to him back in ogos while to public is march, that's a 6 month gap!"
4806,this is incredible! amazing!!!
4808,"once again sal brought us to the next level of learning. one thing i'm going to point out is, this kind education is brilliant with the help of parents/guardian. united states has a good education program but lack of parents/guardians participation."
4815,sal is a great example of the type of leadership that will replace politicians.
4816,i can't help but appreciate sal khan's perspective on these things. i was quite divided on this whole chatgpt situation but this video has really shown me how chatgpt can shape the future of our education. i hope all goes well!
4817,using ai tools to brainstorm ideas
4818,"wow. now we cant deny how useful it is. although, say goodbye to your teachers after this thing"
4819,i'm really impressed by the work you've done to make chatgpt more magical and socratic. it's inspiring to see how ai can be used to enhance human intelligence and potential.
4821,i've see ai in exactly the way you explain in this video. education is dead! long live education! i have been using chatgpt as a personal tutor for the past 2-3 months since i gained access to it and it is incredibly powerful in that regard.
4822,"this is very cool & helpful, but hallucinations are still a big problem, especially if the ai is telling the teacher the info, i think this can create serious issues."
4823,"nobody should use ai as a teacher, only for assistance."
4824,though the problem is if a ai tutor can teach you about a subject like stem whats the point? that machine can do anything for society that the future student can do but better.
4826,"sal's voice is so iconic. i vividly remember 2011 being stressed out about college bio and this man's voice popping up in a youtube video showing me exactly what i needed to know but was too afraid to ask in class. i remember thinking ""this is a cheat code, no one else knows about this""...but nope, we were all using khan academy "
4827,imagine the next version of this ai using sal’s voice 
4829,seeing khan academy's face is amazing
4830,"""khanmigo"" is not an easy name to get used to. they should rename the ai ""khannect"".  connecting 1 on 1 tutoring to everyone."
4832,pretty sure he use chatgpt for this ted talk. that’s the ai talking. 
4833,"spoken like like a true mad scientist...so since apparently you can ask it anything about anything, you should've also mentioned that it's holds great potential as a way to indoctrinate eager unsuspecting kids into a particular world view.  like all technologies it's not all upside. c'mon man."
4834,this is one of the handful of people that inspired me to go back to school and finish a degree in computer science. can’t wait to see the positive impact this will do for others!
4836,this seems an amazing tool for everyone but especially those like mine with learning differences.
4837,oh that’s good. i’m so happy for ai.
4839,game changing...again!
4841,wow 
4844,"yes, people, especially young impressionable unsuspecting kids, will be lulled into accepting anything this thing spews."
4845,the tool is there to aid kids like a tutor in areas of misunderstanding. the feedback on mistakes will make the tool correct itself. this is all part of self learning.
4846,"so, how many of these commentators are being paid by the speaker...or any ai entrepreneur?"
4849,nice sales pitch
4852,"having an ai with internal thoughts is a great idea, but it needs to be accessible as well, at least in a managerial sense.  an ai thinking without saying can become a very serious problem if it expands beyond students and/or teachers."
4853,"ai is a tool and should be used as such, until it decides that it doesn’t want to be a tool... then we may be in trouble."
4855,this man right there is responsible for me having a job today. by far the most beneficially influential person in education since the invention of public schools. khan academy is the greatest thing that ever got started on youtube.
4857,bring ai to khan academy
4858,"this made me tearful. building a ethical business with high values is what sal has done successfully. he is incredible. i wanna build a business like this based on social values and real good instead of squeezing customers for revenue. 
i don’t even need to name the purple monsters but sure they can take a page from this book."
4864,its good just need a few more billion people to get access to the datacenter
4866,the machine is thinking about its thought...did he say that?!
4867,wow i just heard about this in a meeting with a very smart tech person.  the potential to making one on one tutoring for all students and high quality teaching assistance available is so exciting. great talk.
4870,this is amazing!!!
4871,"sal khan is such an amazing educator! in just a few minutes, he manages to convice a crowd of people scared by ai to be excited for it's implementation... *outstanding*"
4873,ppl who wanna cancel ai are the same ones who can't change the  cat filter on their iphone
4875,everyone knows this man’s amazing voice
4877,this won’t end well. teacher ai jobloss? can we ceaseai -gpt? or at least consider pausingai?
4878,loving everything but the product name: khanmigo..
4880,amazing eplaination.. one of the best speeches to date!
4881,"i'm a teacher.  holy crap, this is awesome! and homeschooling is better than government schooling.  private schooling, too."
4885,i cant express how hopeful this makes me for my younger cousins in school who can get access to such amazing tutor which can make learning dramatically better then what exists today 
4889,"so cool to see the face behind the voice behind the digital whiteboard discussing positively, something that most educators are scared of."
4890,"so we are all supposed to talk to chatbots now, pretending a deepfake communication to be real, instead of spending money and employing people with real skills. great..."
4891,"again, chatgpt is for someone who knows the area he/she has knowledge of. otherwise, it's dangerous to use for any reason."
4892,ai teaching us... what could go wrong? 
4893,great 
4894,khanmigo the new education ai
4897,"love how he pauses after announcing the dumb name for dramatic effect and no one cares :) it's self centered enough to put khan in front of everything, it's worse to think people actually find that smart."
4900,"as far as the gatsby part goes, i argue that little exchange was actually a detriment to the student, not an aid. instead of making her think, it just gave her answer. she never had to read, she never had to try. this is turning out to be a real shame."
4903,"6:30 i think that this feature can be risky. i wouldn't want to be impersonated by an ai and have it say things that are not like me. even if im dead

that being said, the rest great for education"
4904,wonderful presentation.
4905,"wish teachers stop trying to knock ai, it's government and administrators who under valued & under funded them for so long. in the end it's students who lose the most."
4906,"yeah, if teachers truly cared about students they wouldn't be worrying if they would be replaced. they would be elated and trying their hardest to incorporate this new tool in their course design."
4908,looking forward for khanmigo. thank you sal khan. 
4909,this is a great talk. thank you salman khan
4912,brilliant by sal khan as always and very great insight from an educator
4914,thank you sal for pushing education forward!
4916,ai will replace teachers
4923,"i was at karaoke last night. somebody asked me about my sister, even though she only sang a few times while she was preparing for the mcat exam. 

i told him that my sister is now a psychiatrist in san diego. we're very proud of her. khan academy definitely helped her with some exam hurdles."
4926,and in charge of the commentary surrounding it as well. very inspiring speech. can't wait to see what his career will hold.
4927," what a great idea! now we just have to figure out who will fill the millions of empty service jobs that keep society running and what to do with the additional millions of unemployed, uneducated people hoping to become astronauts!"
4929,"exactly, but instead we get assholes who harm children and are focused on all the wrong things. sal deserves all the good karma for the stuff he has been doing to advance this country."
4930,@luckytime what do you mean?
4938,"exactly, sal is amazing! used to see his videos more than 10 years ago. i wish he could lead the world in education, the world would be a better place."
4939," ai like this, if managed and developed and integrated properly, could lead us to a world much more like that than the one we currently live in!"
4940,​ why not if pay is good and there is respect like other countries. with proper citizen benefits and if they enjoy why not because society is not made by just engineers and doctors.
4941," if jobs like cleaning service or waiters paid as same as doctors or engineers, only few people will become doctor. only few peple will study hard to get degree, pay for university and more."
4944,"not only him, but when i did the python4all i was amazed by the craftsmanship of dr. chuck. sure wanted to have had more teachers of his kind of teaching and explaining."
4945,i don't know about everybody but i certainly wish he was in charge of education.
4946,"i didn't. he was confusing and left error videos published. so you'd learn the error (precious study time) then  find out there was a correction video. and he side chattered too much. 

he is offensive to learning."
4948, thanks. i see people who blindly love him as a bit culty unfortunately.
4959,"yes, people, especially young impressionable unsuspecting kids, will be lulled into accepting anything this thing spews."
4960,"nothing is perfect, including humans. a similar argument can be made for vaccines. a very small percentage of people might experience adverse side effects from a vaccine, but does that justify completely disregarding the benefits it brings to the majority of people?"
4961,"absolutely incredible. the ways we can collaborate with ai is amazing, it doesn’t have to be a threat to education. since using chatgpt i’ve started understanding concepts so much better and i can only imagine how a specifically coded ai-tutor can transform the educational space. great work!!!"
4963,i'm curious how much power this tool gives a teacher for student performance reviews since khanmigo would have an excellent understanding of the students' strengths and weaknesses.
4964,"""it's easy to focus on the potential downsides of ai in education, but doing so prevents us from realizing the many ways it can revolutionize learning. let's shift our focus to harnessing the power of ai to create a more effective, equitable, and engaging educational experience for everyone."" -gpt-4"
4969," are you kidding me? on kahn academy: ""only available to people living in the us""!"
4972,​ i'm sure if they rely wanted to do that they could obtain the information to do such don't obstruct progress because you are scared of innovation....
4975," ask ai, it knows a lot"
4977,he really said 'give the teacher a super assistant' as if he didn't want to offend the teachers that damn well know they're gonna be out of a job.
4980,i think only the bad teachers will be weeded out. good teachers will be able to use this to their advantage.
4981, you would need full humanoid robots to actually replace teachers. so maybe by 2038.
4987,  good one!
4989,i would love to see him recognized by a piece nobel prize for the awesome impact he has had and continues to have in so many generations. and with ai now and the open use of it we would hopefully change our educational system to meet our current needs.
4996,"such an amazing ted talk, sal khan is a gem to education mashallah! loved the ending 'ai can be used to enhance hi, human intelligence, human potential and human purpose' and i think yes it can and it will :)"
4997,"marvin minsky (the inventor of ai) and i have argued in favour of hi for many years.  see the 1998 hi paper and also our 2013 hi paper (minsky, kurzweil, mann)."
4998,*what this man has done for education is absolutely incredible!*
5000,thanks to him i saved my master's degree lol
5001,"sal khan being brilliant as always

i really hope this brings new opportunities to people who have been left behind until now."
5007," khan academy, then formally bringing ai to education"
5008,yes! thank you. finally some sense.
5012,"i love the concept of ai and what it can do, definitely gonna try the story creation mode!"
5013,thanks so much!
5014,"this is exactly a project i plan to build when i finish learning programming. so amazing to see it being incorporated in khan academy today. 
welldone khanmigo! great job to open ai and khan academy."
5021, ehh i've taken a lot of math courses at university and even i found bingai to be helpful at explaining how to do college level problems
5024," idk people who used the calculator often were always bad at normal math calculations.

but ai is different, it you use it properly it can help so much."
5026, you can't really compare calculator to ai.
5027," i definitely can. 

whenever a new technology that was disruptive towards the status quo, people always pushed back. 

same thing is happening with ai"
5028," calculator did one thing and one thing really well. you still needed a lot of brain power to solve complex math and physics problems. ai, especially agi can do all of that and wouldn't need any human input. it can completely replace you where you're not needed any more."
5030," my background is irrelevant to the conversation, and i never said ai isn’t capable of replacing people"
5032,"give this to everyone! i would love to be able to learn/refresh on all those things again!
*i would gladly pay for this…didn’t mean give as in free for non students although everyone would benefit from this!"
5034,i've been waiting for this talk for weeks and it's finally here 
5037,so amazing.
5040,amazing. this is true that ai can be great alternative especially for people who can't afford professional services or university degrees.
5041,"but do they really kno the information or do the computer kno it?? researching things takes time and effort that’s how your brain store information if u get the information fed to you, u didn’t learn it u regurgitated it!"
5042,​ did you listen to the ted talk? it explains how the ai acts as a tutor. it doesn't give you the answers. it refuses to do that. instead it asks questions to guide you in figuring out how to get the answer on your own.
5045,y'all are over estimating this ai business.
5046,"it's a chain reaction. algorithms, once assembled, allow for less human input to create more output.

a.i. isn't some brand new field, it's existed almost as long as computers have. 

no one underestimates the power of computers, a.i. is pushing computers to be less dependent on human input."
5047,"here before the revolution



edit: thanks for the 10k likes! never had so many!
edit: actually the algorithm had other plans"
5050,"researchers are useless too, when ai catches up."
5053,"aaj ai ki video hi kyu as rahi hai bhai, sandeep sir ne yahi video daali thi"
5057,i love ai
5060,thank you)
5061,nice
5065,academia isn’t education for good quality life
5067,we need more content about artificial intelligence benefits
5068,thanks for the video! =)
5070,super useful comment to leave.
