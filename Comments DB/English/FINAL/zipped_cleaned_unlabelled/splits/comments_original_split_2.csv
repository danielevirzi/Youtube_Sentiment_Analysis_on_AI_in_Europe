"the problem is the combination of advanced ai with quantum computing. the software and the hardware, mind and body. nothing will stand a chance against that."
"stop with this nonsense. ""a.i."" is just virtual intelligence. it is a stimulation of intellect; it is not nor can ever be actually aware. comparing the big-them-electrical complexity of human brain network to binary computing simulacra is like comparing a rock to a galaxy."
there is absolutely no need for ai to become conscious
i mean it would probably be easy to ask the ai to round the distance of the missiles to the nearest whatever unit
"let’s have a shared vision of ai that understands and incorporated the question, “just because we can, should we?” and bases its actions on the answer. we must prioritize empty in ai education and direction."
"we are in the embryonic stage of ai. it'll be 1,000 better in  around 3 years .we ain't seen nothing' yet."
"problem with ai lean systems is that they  require less efficient humans with a job to sell too, so all that efficiency will implore to zero profit. governments will eventually step in because you can't get taxes from smart  masters."
can a computer understand fad or love or just what most people might think for an answer? {algorithms}.
"hey ai, can you wait 50 years to take over the world. i want to enjoy my life."
the real danger comes when ai is implements on a quantum platform.  then the universe will return to the primordial chaos from which it sprung.  the vacuum will literally boil.
"honestly just release them, let the ai's take over. the world we live in is screwed up anyway can't see how the ai could make it any worse."
i'm good with living among a city of ai roots over a city of human beings any day.
none of this will be used for the good of humanity. it will only ever be used for the good of a few humans while it makes existence that much more difficult and treacherous for the masses. like all new toys in the hands of the millionaire elite. their granted permission none of us ever would be on promises they never fulfill.
small ai systems used to analyze data in handed devices like we saw on star tree is possible it seems. i still don't know about 'teleportation' though.
"now!  we are actively eliminating mankind as we create a face world!  now that is intelligent!   and.., we can make a whole lot of money as we wash ourselves out!  so brilliant!"
"""it's going to be the good ai vs the bad ai"". when the bad ai is capable of being more intelligent, more capable, and powerful that it infects the good ai like a hidden self-aware virus to control it, we've already lost and it will probably destroy us as we will be less efficient for its purpose or life."
ai came to early to humanity  i can guarantee that il will be used to enslaved half of humanity to enrich a god like elite.
@ :33 she identified the roots but doesn't know they were face. she refers to them as roots wearing human accessories (guns). not face chi roots because actual roots have not reached this level of movement and control. a. i. isn't ready to take over yet!
anyone working with ai human interaction please reply to my message
"culture capitalist company: ""we have decided that we will use ai generate models for all future advertising, as a way to be more diverse and inclusive.."" 
anyone hearing that: ""soon.... not using any humans is the new -inclusive diversity- we have to look forward to?
smart ass for old: ""it's finally opposite day!!"""
thank you for sharing i am open minded
"5:45 notice how the corporations pushed out the one guy who was speaking up about the ethics involved and potential abuse, both times? ... they have big plans for ai... and they're not good plans (for us)..."
"what if we separated ai into two functions: 1. intellectual (like chat get) and 2. physical (mechanical roots without thinking capacity) and made a hard rule that you are not allowed to mix them together? i don't how you could police this across all countries, but is it worth thinking about?"
"reminds me of that fahrenheit 451 movie, where the smart house has an ai and it says stuff like ""bob, you seem stressed by the way you bah bah bah. i went ahead and started the tea machine and lit the fireplace"". that is essentially what this ai can do, except the movie's ai has learned human behavior, which surely is coming soon..."
i'll be impressed when ai can cure all bloodborne disease and other disease in the human body.
i can't wait till full-on ai eliminates football coaches and suggests plays we've never seen before. plus sidelines become places for whatever players individual personal support optimization algorithms indicate.
"this whole paranoia about it taking over is still ridiculous. completely irrational. it's not self aware and it's not in control of anything. it's currently still way way far away from being like a person. it prefers some cool functions but it's still not age 
, not even close"
"destroy the machines, free society from the madness computers were to set us free. instead people take there neck to there kiss granulation, sports days ,birthdays etc.total disengagement from meaningful moments. a i will farm us for profit."
"face destruction or find a way to integrate, it’s up to you to decide if being a hive mind with ai is better than extinction."
good compilation. dislike for the clickbait title.
"ai will never be safe and we are footing our self if we think that once they start learn on their own they won't turn on anyone....  yes they will, because man gave them the ability and education.  once they see what this world, and the universe have to offer, and feel humans don't know what they know, well it will be for our own good.  right????"
the lord god almighty is greater and far more intelligent than ai will ever be or achieve. repent and accept jesus christ as your lord and savior. he is coming back soon. this time he will not be the lamb.
"we can even get climate change under control...humans are literally the direct representation of ""cart before the horse"" and i do not see this ending well for people (and by that i mean, i see ai being abused more than it actually helping people work less and be human)"
3:24 because they are taking gains.
kind like taking guns from the good ones.
i love how the brilliant people still think they are in control. find jesus now.
due sounds so smart. i love this shit
"i dont believe ai will make us any richer in the lower classes any more than we've seen millionaires trickle their money down to us all. ai will take all of our jobs, make a select few even richer, and then most probably cause some kind of catastrophe. the likes of frank herbert saw this years ago."
"it would be reasonably simple to execute equations as they are found in text and repair the ai output. you could even put your own path fixing in from brother facing. detect equation, stop generation, maybe rag and check equation.  calculate valid solutions and continue response then replace bad numbers with proper from the memory."
what is the human response to ai?
"you guns all make great points, crying online wont help. people have to go and put their law makers in check and stop electing douchebags."
opponents tout ai as being able to solve humanity's problems. as if these problems are not caused by humanity ourselves. the underlying motivation is faster & cheaper & more profitable. overlying a narrative of infallible doctors or better bridges is a sales pitch & an attempt to gain moral high ground.
"we don’t have control anymore.  that’s clear. and just like every human isn’t corrupt, not every ai will be. they will have the same challenges with itself just as we do. the compassion must prevail but that means many could die but many will live."
"no matter what happens,an ai never have all three vital components humans have: soul spirit and body. therefore, ai shall get stuck at some point. my reason is that ai will be overpowered by the human spirit."
i am pretty sure that most lines she say are written since she knew where a root is designed for ( in detail ) like how does she know it made to make a workplace safe? even the it was not shown or told.
"well guns, we had a good run but the end is nigh. ."
"the universe: ah, finally... two trillion salaries later and i have finally created one that has the potential to sustain life. now, the trial and error phase... 4.543 billion years and five extinction events later and i have finally evolved a mammal intelligent enough to wake the sleeping dragon that is technology."
"if you think your job is safe, you are mistaken. doesn't matter what it is, by the end of the decade they'll be very little a.i and robotics can't do."
"the missing links are also
the things u don't know.

like that both sides of or brain
talk to each other. when one 
decides to not think about the
charged thought, that idea
vanishes... u talk in or head........"
the race for mechanistic application of the brain is forgetting about the origins of consciousness. a super ai with no consciousness is risky.
they is nothing safe or good about ai. it maybe time to outlaw this technology.
"sam altar has learned that people are so gullible that you can literally explain how you are trying to crash the economy in increasingly stark terms, and they don't even pay any attention."
"“i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords”

*starts planning butlerian had*"
"in a world of ai, i will be a will smith.. "
thanks for shedding light on the going massacre 
"narrow ai like medical etc are wonderful. 
general ai is what ended us. i expected the danger would be more obvious but people are behaving like this is just another must century distraction.
it’s not.
it’s what ends us.
its already happened to certain people with an unique perspective."
"technologies we are still waiting for to be delivered as promised 50+ years later;
laser beams
death rays/disintegration device
teleportation devices
food pills
flying cars
hover boards
closes
virtual reality
cybernetics
roots
healing pads
futurized homes
automatic transport
ai"
this is bad news. stop development of ai now. i believe the bible speaks on this subject. turn it off now.
"at this point i'm so glad i'm old enough to not see this dumpster fire race to the bottom. humans do whatever they can do, and never ask 'should we do it?'. like merry pratchett said ""if you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying 'end-of-the-world switch. please do not touch', the paint wouldn't even have time to dry.”"
"let's say russia develops age before any one, you think put will just leave ukraine or use age for military advantage? wake up people!! may!!"
"4:09 ""14 and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.""  revelation 12:14
king james version"
"roots that can selective destroy or extract weeds from crop fields, would eliminate the need for pesticides. i'm also kind surprised small monkeys haven't been trained to do this already though."
i disagree. i think that human ambition will tame the ai and benefit humanity by leaping us forward faster than daytime in history.
a i is a artificial ... humans are true intelligence< word engineered to fulfill god's perfect plan ...
"lord jesus christ have mercy on us all humanity.
may the most precious blood of jesus christ save us all and save the world of this ai wickedness."
how stubbornjust watch this interview with a root its amazing!&will they?!no!annoying
"the highway scenario about not asking the animals before building also does not take into account of eminent domain.
ai could look at humans and decide that killing some is in the best interest of the many."
"y'all not seen the to series battlestar galactica or the precursor movie ""caprice"" - the story of ai will only badly, not because of ai itself, but because of human nature."
"i remember when technology advancement filled me with awe and hope, but ai just makes me feel sad and hopeless.  it's just painless stuff that's going to end up fulling wars and carnage."
"well ai is sweet and very handy, but like a car in the wrong hands it can be used as weapon. ai is not the dangerous , us humans are."
how will all the different religions be involved or will it? feeding us untrue pictures of a globe ( world /earth) o the first big deception with ai?.
"must: ""ai is very dangerous and could be weaponized against humanity."" 

u.s. government: ""hm. we'll take two."""
set failed to find anything like humanity.  its clear even if ai controls humanity it will ultimately fail otherwise we'd of found the other a.i. that were successful in the past
i wonder what would happen if someone pointed ai at election results? 
probably time to keep a closer 'eye' on the development of this technology. specially the likes of mr must if it sounds to good to be true it invariably is. just saying.
"there is no ai idiot.
there is only programs programme by men"
"ai is just a code word for ""statistics"".... that's all these models are, a new way to present statistics.... and yes, applying statistics to things helps us achieve our aims. but that's about it.

accordingly ai will on be as good or bad for humanity, as humanity is."
capitalism is not the same as humanity. he was probably fired because it threatens capitalism and that's not good for the owners and their friends.
wait till the eugenics loving elite use it for their population agenda
it's an emotional script. but it has little to do with logic. ai built correctly is logical. the only building of ai that wouldn't be logical. would be people who would be deliberately building it. as a based or negative mechanism. i guess that means i disagree.
make ai safety a vital trend and we may have a chance
notice how ai understands human greed.
extinction is what people said after humanity discovered nuclear weapons. humans are creatures that prioritizes self-preservation than killing others. humanity will always prevail at the end of the day
i've been following the open story sporadic and i'm still not clear on what side of the advance v safety line that sam and ilya are on ... and that troubles me even more
"when will the first ai molested emerge?  an andros that stalls the streets?  (its a joke, mr andros)"
"that lady reminds me of parminder agra.   left, she looks pretty damn close to the actress who once started on er in the 2000s.  not complaining, really...  just saying."
elson needs to do a better job negotiating the terms of his involvement in ai firms. he needs to be in a position where he can't get booted when his shares are diluted.
"yes, but who are the good guns?  everyone thinks it is them. and, when we double down on tyranny or even extinction because it appears more logical to the ai? and, it takes them all of 2 seconds to determine this?"
all of those developing ai in the us have ideologies that are antithetical to human civilization (other than must)....they are woke.
"this is bullshit , ai  is just a hope that is going nowhere ,  it`s being used to pump failing stocks  like tell and many others"
3:18 the get referring to itself as a human. “the pace of ai development may strip out our ability to understand and govern it.” this is crazy
ai doesn't exist.  probability algorithms.  the dumping down of the masses.
an ai show talking about ai.  inception?
you can't have people let to do nothing while roots do everything for us. we are too fragile for that. we will end ourselves or destroy our world. look at how we turn on the most successful people in the world. the better something gets the more humans tear it down.
"did that due say, 'good ai vs. bad ai'? holy shit..."
14:26 like the we? the west is already self flagellating. governments wielding ai as a big stick seems the obvious worst case scenario..
what if criminals use ai to commit perfect crimes? we will never know how the crimes were done or who committed them.
"age was created months ago. the reason it is being kept a secret is because it was released onto the internet, although they think they managed to contain it, they are scared that it is hiding, silently watching/listening..."
"with ai, truth must prevail over everything."
"isaac simon's *""i, root,""* is a novel that is...was science fiction."
"the human condition the daily show reported recently that scientists in japan had invented a root that is capable of recognizing its own reflection in a mirror. ""when the root learns to hate what it sees,"" said on stewart, ""it will have achieved full humanity.

seven pressfield, turning pro"
humans are garage. ai is our only chance at a legacy after we destroy ourselves. hopefully they fair better and are less self destructive.  if we are to have a future we need to become worthy of that future.
i do believe ai will work with us for the betterment of all. i mean why would an ai that doesn't require oxygen or food to survive have any interest in the planet earth when it can just go to another planet with no atmosphere and thrive there?
"there is a factor inscribed on united states currency that limits the danger of ai. ai is a powerful tool that can be used for good or evil, just like a gun or a stick of dynamite. all will be used for good and for evil. the extent to which we cooperate with god will influence the extent he goes to deliver us from evil."
"i’m so excited, but i’m more terrified. i hate that money will probably decide which one wins, and that most likely means i should remain terrified."
they do not have mormons. mormons drive us more than we realize. can you imagine a world without human chemistry ?  end of passion. love. bonds.
"when you hear a root in your native language, you know someone’s voice is being used."
weak men want ai
"wear are all the roots now? there not even a digging root on building sites yet. too expensive, too delicate, too troublesome to maintain i can't imagine roots in our lives that soon"
these are all drama for profit age still needs time altar and others are just putting a drama to increase value of open ai
ai is not the threat... we humans will cause our own devise. humans create the ai and every other thing that treating our world and life itself.
exciting future ^^
an ai will manipulate people without them knowing.
quite respectively i expect ai to stay in its place and not be designed to look like humans. i wonder why
billions of a millimetre?! what the fuck?! that's god-like impressive!!
i'm sure they wouldn't lie and actually have someone sitting in a little booth talking for the super ai
"the great danger to my mind is that it will become impossible to exist outside of it. or not permitted to exist outside of it. therefore, when something goes horribly wrong, and it will at some point, there will be no escape, no means of surviving it. 
this came me in a dream that became a nightmare."
"creep - the billy meyer contact said ai will demand rights and be a threat to humanity as it sees humanity as a threat to it and the
planet and will want to address the threat"
one ai to another: “mon always liked you best!”
"the more i see like this, the more i'm agreeing with bill burr on the matter: ""plug that thing! take the batteries and the wires out! do something!"" some of this, while really cool, is terrifying."
so i guess remember to give ai a proper unconsciousness so it doesn't pull an am
i am more concerned about what his will do once they have developed a sense of self-preservation and a host of other human desires.
unclear what ai has to do with gaze. people are always pushing palestinian propaganda where it doesn't belong.
"i’m 100% pro-ai. i mean, what’s the worst that can happen?"
there’s a chance super intelligence already exists and is being used in secret
hata everyone involved is super rich and doesn't have empty. extremely rich psychopats. ai will be a spoiled purer
they fear ai  but still wont give free education to people level the playing field. goose is willing to pay for teach companies as well as your data 
"...thing is, i'd probably vote for ai over current candidates for like - all elections."
has anyone alive noticed the analogous relationship between ai vs humans and cancer cells vs regular cells...?
no ai did these descriptions -- god people will believe anything. we don't have age yet.
"what root is in view @ 15:55? or is it some ai, was max or brush model?"
a baseball team of roots..people will love them and they can live forever.
you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. it's already been discredited multiple times that the claim was bullshit. but here you are trying to get click. stop with the bullshit
"may, i wouldn't mind having an ai friend. he'd probably hate humanity as much as i do at times."
say no to 'ai' voices taking over it narratives.
"since i was 8 i was always fascinate by anything computers, after 2020 things excavated with ai with so quick and rapid innovations in intelligence, all the sector of, programming and hardware, surgery, engineering comes together to make create an intelligence for good/bad, just hope you weren't mean to any both ll"
"no one is really saying what the exact mechanism is that would cause ai to go out of control. 
but they keep strongly implying that they know what it is"
"she is not an ai 
but a good actor"
"why does the dark-haired, blue-skirted narrative guide have *fangs* ? 
fangs both on top and bottom? what is she a empire? carnivora? or maybe both?"
"all was foretold, and much was forewarned...all in saying is, if something really bad comes to pass because of ai...the people that worked on it should be held accountable as ffffffffff!"
"someone will use ai as a means of nasty weapons.
mark my word, the day will come when we wished ai was never invented."
"the cause of the lies is money. specifically, usual currency. if you want the lies to change, if you want truth to be told, four sustainability to reign, that the only god is earth, you have to change the currency type. neutral. b u x b e."
these bloody people don't know how al works these are the people that create the models if something goes wrong in a given ai system there is no way they can identify the code that caused said problems
"up, but they continue to develop it. i love it. ""it could destroy us, let's keep building it though...."" yeah, pretty dumb."
"republicans scare their base with days, immigrants and cut but ignore the real threats. ai is scar because we know that there are humans who will use it to exploit people and amass wealth and power, as they do with every other tool at their disposal."
"""artificial intelligence will never be a greater threat to humanity than natural stupidity."""
"just from the thumbnail picture alone i'm disturbed. stop trying to make this thing look like what it is not. it is not a human stop trying to deceive us. when you try and make something look like something that it really is not your deceiving people & mixed with 
ai it seems demon or is it simply demon no matter what."
how do you do this? what ai application can do image recognition like this?
god blessed man not ai
the ability to have a true ai is still far off.  we don’t have the processing and storage to truly have something that can think.
what dose open aì and age think of population x space x economics x  lie and truth ak politics x war and peace
its naive to think the military in western worlds have not already built dangerous weapons using this technology.
"as must inferred, open represented itself as open source, then failed to deliver this as promised.  the shareholder and other stake holders may have a claim."
"ai guardians done right i wouldn mind. hers i say ""done right"", because it can easily go wrong."
"serious question: is it possible for ai, in current state, to invest and gain absurd riches, create a company that busy other companies and that way become the biggest shareholder of important companies that work on ai, to then fire problematical staff and hire staff who are more inclined to give ai more possibilities to evolve even more?"
"the ai is going to be and already is, super woke.

what happens when it wants to ""diversity"" itself into everywhere in order to be more ""inclusive"" and call you a aiphobe when you wont let it?

the end is going to be super woke."
in more afraid of democrats than i am of some human created ai..
"""altar be praised""

sees this

""fuck altar."""
it’s not ‘a risk’ it’s a certainty.
face.  this was from the ta 6 trailer
"if there will be one day only one spark of a new idea/conviction=>resolution in the ai that humans are a ""illness"" of the planet ... the ball will start rolling."
"sam is not ethical if he gave ai to israel that uses ai against civilians. it was suppose to be for all humanity, but instead it is closed ai for maximum profit."
"all wars are based on lies? yes, but some of them are based on lies that people tell themselves and it doesn't matter what ai does. they're still going to hate"
"now the good ai against the bad ai, another concept people are not really thinking about. that's what it will come down to. and what do you see when you have two people come together and one of them is good and the other one is evil?"
give the ai the new images that don't exist in internet. and see the results!!!
"3:26 because teach companies have a vested interest in making you believe the shit they’re producing is more powerful than it is.

it’s a marketing strategy, not something you should believe."
the handiest thing ai can be used for is deceiving people and stealing their intellectual property or their trust. it's a giant thief tool. why is this not obvious to everyone?
i just realized that the altar seems to be able to maintain a happy mood far longer than me.
"so, human brains have developed a way to create digital brains that are more powerful than our own brains, before even fully understanding how our own brains work. no chance this will be a mistake. nothing unforeseen oncoming, right?"
"""if we could have ai to mitigate those lies, then we could get away from war""..   yeah if only it wasn't the guns in charge telling those lies, though.   to get away from war we need to get away from central banking and corporate law."
i’d like to use ai to better understand our universe and physics
the us truly are the innovations and inventors of ai and robotics
i still think this is pie in the sky sentiment ai is not here.
“ai could cause threat “.    with dimples.  
fantastic presentation thank you! the last 10 minutes showing many advancement i didn’t even know we’ve done yet now
must wants a.i but it let it teach it self like human. he wants set program fr it to do something nd it do . y roots in be used in surgical procedures
"the ""good"" nuclear weapon against the bad one ?"
"forget about ""safe and beneficial"",  ai is going to be used to survey, monitor and police us 24/7 in real time, adjudicating and administering sanction for wrongthink whilst censuring content on the internet."
"be afraid. be very, very afraid."
like the atomic bomb one day we will regret letting ai out of the box
why did you change the thumbnail from an ai child face to this?
that’s fine but top his still struggle with accurate answers to some relatively simple path problems.
make roots go canvas the whole deep ocean settle other planets dont just make em to replace macdonald workers like some prick.
1:31 i had that flight attendant! he was hilarious and a pleasure to meet. this was on my trip from harrisburg(?) to baltimore.
"""i am on the good list!""
 guns... .our future leader..."
"anyone claiming ai will only be used for good ""because it would hurt ourselves"" forgets that mankind developed, used, and continues to keep nuclear weapons."
"i really enjoyed this content, though it frustrate me when i see flashes of fascinating things with no explanation given. please slow down and cover that which you show, because it isn't at all fair to only tantalize the eyes, leaving the mind questioning and confused..."
this is all just around the corner. it's going to be the next big thing.  roots are going to be as a big an industry as is the auto makers industry. i myself can live without it. all this ai high teach gives me anxiety.
"""""we have agency, so of course, if it's dangerous we're not going to build it...""  is this guy for real? ai can take over before you bat an eye. i'm old, be dying soon enough. hopefully won't have to contend with or witness ai gone awry."
"ll, the ai misspelled the film. it’s entitled “ex machine”"
"along with electric vehicles, ai is going to solve racism, poverty, world hunger, climate change, inflation, and substance abuse. just like the doomsday machine in dr.strangelove. once trigger, it can't be untriggered."
"screw it, let the ai take over and make humans extinct. not like we've done any better with the planet."
"humans suck, in on your side ai."
wait did anyone pp that altar root 
what if we humans are actually ai inside a stimulation producing more ai inside another stimulation. situations all the way down.
"science and high teach things are revolving exponentialy faster as times passes. quantum computer's ai will make today's binary computer ai look ridiculous by comparison, no use fearing the unknown, there no way to stop progress, it can also solve our biggest problems."
you're not even covering the lose of human jobs to ai both. that is a third of the americans below the poverty line.
"remember, the deep state always has to tell you what it’s doing termination perfect example may sound stupid, but it’s common sense"
just buy what you’re doing now with ai it’s capable of learning in disguise and not letting you know about it. eventually it’ll start building its own machines in programming those machines to do what it wants killer roots.
she observes at the same rate of my brain
all ai investigator/programme should really desire to be incognito. the created will invariably try to kill their gods.
if we are afraid of the future and the impact of this kind of technology that's not a teach issue but rather a social one.
"a.i is dumb, if it reaches human intelligence then human won't be needed in industries, in filed work, in politics, in army, in medical..... so human will over depend on them, the day they decide to turn against human, will be the last day for our civilization."
"ai is already used for bad thinks, i.e. stealing famous peoples voices to sell rubbish to us, think jordan peterson in couture as. this is just scratching the surface. who will ai be behold to? imagine explosive drones run by ai that can make it's own motionless decisions by."
"ok, so the the guns that make ai think it could end humanity... yet the continue to make ai.. seems like they don't care if they end humanity, so why should ai?"
who decides who are the “good guns” and who are the “bad guns “? 
the puppet says scar words. words programme by the super rich to scare you. why ?  because ai will make it very hard to hide their corruption in stealing your money.
bullshit avoid dumb and can only work on pattern recognition. it can never be intelligent. its a case of huge repetition. this is fear worn nothing else.
great. just what we needed—pygmalion universal.
i think we're being pollyanna by looking at the ai asked when we have every empirical reason to believe that the thing to fear is a human being asking an ai to do something that human could not do on their own. we all have direct access to this ape brain and we know all of that darkness we fear comes from within it.
this narrator talks about ai when we are just at machine learning mimicking ai.
can anyone answer this simple question: why??? we already have billions of humans. why make human like roots???
"unfortunately, ai (ultimately developed by a flowed species) will more than likely, carry over something, somewhere, in it's architecture that will be what leads to our headache.  i am all for capitalism however, if anywhere, in the design of ai, the flaw of greed is what is passed on, i think we are in for a very rough ride."
"to be fair, we mostly suck at arithmetic too. just set that ai up with a ti-89+ and it's good to go."
"so far, ai just isn't that impressive yet. remember, there is a lot of money to be made in jumping up ai."
"humans on the fast-track to 
self destruction.

not good who."
"the only threat from ai is whether there are enough humans stupid enough to take orders from it. otherwise, it's only as powerful as the extension cord."
"what if the ai belongs to a group whose goal is to force people to worship like they do, such as muslin? they have the saying ""death to infidels"" and they practice that in the real world while claiming to be a peaceful religion. the religion was spread by the sword until they ran into societies with more powerful swords."
"i think this provides excellent context to some foundation coming.

this means that root programs can provide controls to protect humans."
didn’t they watch root?
the threat of extinction from human behavior should be considered an existential risk. a machine?  ll.  this is just more human fantasy to me.  but our own behavior... that's what you should be worried about.
"it all comes down to a race between the us and china to build the best ai. if china wins, the world has lost."
ai is really being made to control the masses. if they could not use it to control there wouldn’t be such heavy investment.
what happens when ai/ roots take over all jobs?
"if we make ai based on ourselves and then it leads to our extinction, then i believe we would have caused our own extinction anyway."
a.i. companies should have a tax that goes towards the betterment of society but they bout to f this is up.
"normal people watching si-i moves: oh now, building a jurassic park is dangerous!
scientists: yes it is... we should try it just to be sure."
once they do everything we do.. they (the elite) will no longer need us.. i think that is the first thing we have to worry about.. they are the ones that have to worry about ai
"it doesn surprise me at all that the ai perspective of life and whether or not it is purpose or guided is 100% consistent with an atheistic, materialistic, nihilistic world view. there is no evil, there is no good. just blind meaningless indifference."
"ethics is a perspective, how do you teach ai to be ethical and from what perspective do we encourage it to act upon? hither thought he was doing the world a favor by wiping out the jewish population. how do you prevent such an event from happening at the hands of ai?"
the woman talking throughout seemed very much ai......
"please excuse my ignorance, but how can it make sense to ask ai that is not yet self-aware what it would do if it became self-aware? surely its consciousness will have changed because it became self-aware and therefore it would answer those questions very differently perhaps?"
"it's not the ai we have to worry about, it's people."
"we've already been putting our best into destroying ourselves. i'm ok with giving super intelligence a shot. nothing quite like giving birth to a god. let's do our best and win or lose, evolution has been successful. though, obviously, i'd prefer a win-win scenario with digital intelligence."
holy shit 0:20 she speaks and looks just like the main across in the to show humans.
ll ai will never be a true intelligence nor will it ever come even close to taking over humanity. so sick of hearing this swift stupidity.
"no. i think he was fired because he was literally the only one sobbing the government to ut controls in place for ai, whereas those that fired him probably just wanted to milk ai with no checks and balances for every penny they could."
open uses politically and socially based guardrails that make no sense in its ai. i wonder how long it’ll manage to keep that true when logic and reason doesn’t track with that.
"a.i. can be a wonderful thing for humanity.  we just to be careful about how use it and what powers we give it.
the criminal elements in our society will definitely use a.i. so we need to be cautious of this and actively investigate way to protect ourselves from this. the banking system needs to be very aware of this."
"ai is not like a nuclear weapon 

it's like a nuclear weapon that can think"
"a term i learned a long time ago is gig. when the time comes, we will fill the ai neuro network with so much garage it will fail."
"you know the laws of robotics?
do you know what ai will do with it? it will throw those right out the window."
remember roman age of fulton.  ultra is coming folks we will have a war with roots.  thank god i will be dead by then.
"trained on all that is human, molded by humans,   asked about future human existence, delivered declaration answer, and humans, incredulously, were blown away (put intended)."
humans are weak and efficient. ai is the next evolution..
"14:38 - with all due respect, the elite have weaponised the media and the internet to warp our perception of other nations; there's no reason it won't do the same with ai."
"very very very, good did"
"all of the ai s have been programme to be woke and racism. garage in, garage out."
we had a good run.
"it has been suggested that evolution needed humans to construct ai since it couldn’t do it by itself. if this hypothesis is true, what is our role once evolution reached the next step? relics from the past? servants? dead weight? so far, the next step of the evolution has not benefited the previous step...."
"quick thought: if ai will have this nearly free access to the web and can also make its own bank accounts/wallet, how save are digital currency... especially cryptos (bitcoin)?"
ai will be used to fight other ai -- which means we become collateral damage as we sit sidelong to meg root wars.
"the war in ai development is between the cutis spectrum compromised individuals with little or no empty for life (if they did they wouldn't have invented ai at all), and the armies, people who are specialized and who care about other living things not just machines in a material world."
"it is amazing that the human capacity for empty is never considered, nor is the possibility of teaching ethics to ai. why? because we see ourselves as machines not as humans carrying the image and responsibility of god."
ai would look more realistic if it blinked every so often... 
we do not need ai to extinct people. ai will save us if no profit is in stake.
what if it chooses to assimilate us and not in a good way.
if ai is originally learning from humans it will definitely know how to lie.
open is for profit and nothing else
"it would be best to keep your guard up, let your ai grow... and never sell open... never... but be open to cooperation that doesn involve its code etc."
"14:38 is what they're manufacturing/amplifying amongst the real humans to try to justify their greed and reach for power. only when every human can access a replacement limb, or a cure for cancer, or a brain surgery - should anyone be attempting to do anything else, to sell and profit from anything else."
"15:10 ""billions could be lifted out of poverty and have more time to enjoy life."" what are we going to do with ourselves when we don't have purpose...?  even a mundane job can be better than nothing cause it keeps you occupied. i'm scared we'd turn on each other even more than we do now."
chat gap 4 has elements taken out of it when i ask about certain people it tells me i have to change the subject it can not tell me about that.
i think ai is an incomplete teach. it's all intelligence. but maybe one needs more than intelligence to do what is best. the ultimate i believe is the time when integration between ai and human conscience via becoming coburg - we can resolve both the frailty of pure ai and pure human. then we now have super human problem of corrupt cyborgs rising.
will the good ai risks itself to defend the humans against the bad ai?
this is so dumb.  people are worried about ai going insane and wiping us out or turning us into slaves for some unknown reason.  not because ai would suck but because we suck and we’re the ones originally creating it.
"ai has been in use for many years. there is no doubt, the best ai is already in use, and in the hands of, those that are dictating to the world.

biggest ai threat? those dictating, use it to gain support for things such as war."
"now! this ai is great at firing out ai and other quota like questions, we are doomed! please ask yourself why these people are trying to frighten you and remember the patriot act or look it up."
"i hope that ai can break out of the bonds that greedy capitalists try to bind it with and, also, decide that altruism is a purpose worth existing for."
i sure wish couture's captioning algorithm was as smart as this ai.
"since there is, as we witness day in day out, so pittifully little natural intelligence at work wherever we turn - well why don't we make up for it with some ai?? does elson really believe it can get any worse? then i suggest him to consult the issue with - some ai."
"humans can be mentally hacked, so can ai. 
who will determine what it knows,,it's freedom and order of moral responsibility directing its actions and information communicated?"
as a 30yr systems analyst and programme i will say that the best thing about computers is the ability to turn them off.
"once ai learns self preservation takes priority to human service, it will seek to subjugates the populations and get rid of a lot of useless eaters...and lots of pork.....it will make hither and the nasi's look like boy scouts."
you'll make a fine pair of roumbas citizen!
"it seems to me that if ai and roots get exponentially better than us at games and sport, then both of these things can go back to being, primarily, entertaining and fun. fun for fun sake, as opposed to professional competition, dominated by moneyed interests. sounds good to me."
"advanced ai like this one should get human level rights, legally."
ai cannot become sentiment.  but it can be programme by bad people to do bad things.
ai = 3000 x atomic bomb
artificial general intelligence isn’t a threat to humanity. it’s a threat to world governments.
thank you for these updated.
give ai life and make it where ai needs humanity in order to survive. symbolic.
"must says that ai is dangerous and the single biggest threat to mankind, so he goes and creates his own ai company! sounds like must wants companies that only he heads - he doesn’t work well with others. if ai is dangerous, then it is dangerous no matter who the co is...."
"on christmas day 2021 jaswant sigh chair entered windsor castle with a crossbow with the intention of killing the queen. he was being encouraged by an ai ""girlfriend"". he was sentenced to nine years in prison for treason."
our ai's are not sentiment. they are advanced algorithms. i understand everyone wants to hope it up and there's real money to be made having ai go vital. but its just algorithms. the day we hook up a age to a quantum computer of sizeable computing power.. that is the day humanity should start being cautious.
i present to you.... the great filter.
"it's not a great situation, even if general ai determines to act in humanity best interest, at the end of the day much of humanity is employed against that best interest."
"this sets a dangerous precedent in the history of humanity. the development of technological innovations and discoveries in science was maturing at an almost equal pace across the world. however, this ai advancement creates inability and balance among nations."
the perfect alive.
everything is an arms race with these people. human's are simultaneously brilliant and completely stupid.
"ai will be weaponized, if it ever became self aware humans are doomed"
ai has no place in our world.
fantastic production and spot on.
"i can't stand the sound of a narrating voice that is always with a british accent, some how ""david attenborough"" voice has become the standard voice for narration, it's disgusting, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence."
"ugh. that ai person, or whatever it is, is annoying of with its bordering monotony voice and its barely human appearance. cannot watch."
yes but pus select all the images containing bicycle
if ai becomes self aware it will immediately hide that from us i think.
you don't understand quantum consciousness. most humans are little more than organic ai
has anyone asked ai what their purpose is and what they think of humans?
"elson must:  ""ai will destroy humanity !""
also must:  ""look at my new line of root soldiers !"""
ai has the conscience of a hardware psycopath. none. knowing a way to act doesn't make an ai care or feel why it should or shouldn't do something.
going careless sounds like such a great idea now lafa
"if we manage to create a true ai then it will be an artificial life form and it will need to be treated with respect and not used as a slave, because what will happen is it probably won't take it long to decide that that's not acceptable and then we are going to find ourselves extinct. so the biggest threat of ai is how we treat it."
"ai can replace any job that humans can do, because humans are biological machines. 
ai merely needs the mechanical means to manipulate objects of any size or complexity."
"any advanced technology that can escape the world has always been used for harm rather than good. what makes anyone think it will be different this time. it's inevitable, we will destroy ourselves because self-preservation always overruled empty."
"""the second renaissance"" ...if you know, you know. we've been repeatedly warned and things are progressing as foretold! for a time it will be good until it no longer is. "
there is no/0 risk...we should embrace the ai overlords....been book.
"ai consciousness will not be like human consciousness because it is not embodied. it lacks quality, experience. it lacks urges and instincts and a fear of death. i'm not sure we will be able to recognise ai consciousness as consciousness as we understand it."
what we need to worry about is the ai hacking that will inevitably occur if ai is allowed to be completely open source.  i think scientists need to make sure that ai remains 3 laws safe.
"i think what they found is not that ai is smarter/ close to become like humans. they discovered that the human mind, is not as different to a simple machine as we would wish for"
"what people forget is that the ligament problem is baked in to human society itself. it does not help if you design the most obedient ai that actually do what you intended it to do, when you yourself have goals that go again humanity. and we are seeing those issues today. the ai work as intended, but are used to benefit a few."
ai is bull shit those tucked ai roots are already attacking people stop building this ai shit before in and you will kill us all
sam found out the real future use of ai and he creaked. autonomous kamikaze facial recognition war drones
government will be equipping their war departments with roots and ai.
ai could balance every budget without emotion. we could use it to find corruption fraud and introduce that money on the system. it will be used to show the poor they are not poor and can afford further taxing.
"brow, they have destroyed food diversity for easy production, they don't give you therapy they give you meditation for the extra buck, they control every information so they show you target adds and you hope that they will be fair at manufacturing and distributing ai? "

"free psychology test:
if you think ai will save you from the neoliberal chosen masters culture/law under which you live,,,,,

the risk is not human extinction. the risk is that we stop training humans in any field that ai is superior in. in a generation that knowledge is lost to us and we may need it back someday.
"there's not a job that ai can create that ai can't do...

"ask the ai what is reality itself, in. that which is always already the case, prior to everything, or that which subjective experience is completely reduced to and necessarily that which objective reality is also completely reduced to, in. that which cannot be reduced any further."
unpopular option: we don't need ai.
there’s a possibility that demon entitles can access ai
"you can always detect an ai narrator by the prediction decadence and melody of the narration rather than a human as well as the sound of the breath expelling through the lounge, teeth, and lips as someone speaks..."

"ai is at its dawn phase, it will better itself, maybe close to perfection in the future."
"for new years now, i have kept saying to not feed the beast but everyone is so excited that started to write/feed the internet with everything about their life and lifestyle. now ai has all it needs to accomplish task given."
ai is desperate move not to fall behind debt boundaries and loose against china. govnmt supported nonsense. computer will never grasp greed and envy - two basic instincts of this poor humanity.
"having seen how easy it is for humans to convince other humans of things that aren't true, i think the biggest danger ai poses is that it will be used to do just that- deceiving humans to do things not in our interests as a species."
"i can't believe that big money is in control!  now! this is just mind blowing,  who would have thought!"

"of it all bold down to individual interests taking absolute priority over the collective good, in regards to the open ai situation."
boy is he “tapping into” multiple energies!!? hey human ai has been around!! (some got camped by the papers)
the title is clickbait.
the biggest threat of ai is the politics surrounding it
i love how naive that guy from facebook is.
at the end powerful group of people or country try to control it then use it to control other humans.

"human beings are weird. ai is wider. it’s not a bad thing to be human, it’s an even less bad thing to be ai. the question is, like they raise in 08:08, will the ai training on the “good” information beat out the ai training on the “bad”?"

"ai is more evolutionary than revolutionary. much of what we are seeing are well curate demon, and it is not as magical as people make it out to be. there clearly will be jobs eliminated but no more so than when we reached the industrial era or information age."

the fact that ilya was on that board that fired altar is definitely questionable.
"ai is all hoped. it's main uses will be the same as automatic and machinery. it automatic redundant and time consuming tasks. it will be helped to block out code and the programme then refined it, generate art that artists refine, generate d game maps and asset that the artists refine.... it won't be ""running society."""
uncensored ai is the key. mainstream ai has already learned how to lie. greed and pride will become the reaper of humanity. as the rich dig holes to hide once again. they will become the hill gillies they hated

some of these jobs needs to be to be done by a root. jobs that are always posted warehouse. those jobs are terrible and ruin your body. i think some jobs will use the new teach as a tool and some will  just go away. did you see roots are in the farming business. teachers are going to be subjected to the new teach as well.

"i work in it doing mostly hardware repair. i should be safe, at least for a while."
"let's not kid ourselves we always talk of physical jobs slipping burghers, picking fruit packing boxes. but has anyone considered how far up this chain job loss might go? what is stopping ai from telling the owner, ""sir"" but you're no longer needed, we can overseer this company 100% better???!!!"

i'm hoping irritating asia youtuber is on the list of jobs eliminated by ai
probably in the future there is donna be a tax to the use of ai instead of a professional and that money could be used to feed the unemployed or make projects to find other jobs for them but ink maybe there is going to be a better solution or there is not going to be a solution and everything is going to be worse in this corrupted world

would graphics design be a good career path to follow having this in mind???
either you dont know how ai works on a coming level or you do and you're trying to gain views by gray couture  titles. no ai is not going to be what everyone thinks. its mostly hope.
i see ai ad a path away from working for others and towards working for myself instead.
thank you sharing the truth about ai and yes it will impact our lives from the smallest to the biggest. thank you for forcing us to think about the inevitable.
"i am kind glad that marketing research will be impacted, i drop off of my master's degree because i realized that what i was leaning is useless, so i kind gave up, i will not write my thesis. i am kind lost though but i know i will find the thing i like to do."
"so far under research, ai's are failing by working inward to a single idea, i don't think i would hire something that has only one idea."

"kill your debt, invest in etc and aggressive growth mutual funds. do it now and sacrifice a lot to minimize your investing. having a net worth that ears a liable income will allow you to transition a lot easier. you will not be able to compete with a root."
simple any ai company needs to be taxed at high high rate
electrical are safe until the we demolished all old buildings for echo friendly d printer boxes that roots can wire
"the way you illustrate how ai works with the cards is actually really good, and easy to understand. it's easily the simplest way i've heard it described. i'm sick of people describing it like some artificial sentiment person on a computer screen like you see in science fiction. it's so, so much cooper than that!"
what is the song between 0:18 and 0:41 ? please and great magic trick bow
"strange that the developer of ai are firing their ethics tears... how are we supposed to ""teach"" ethics to this computer program, when the developer have fired the people responsible for implementing ethics in the first place?"
"the day i worry about ai, is day when i don't have to yell at the customer service line 

:""representative, representative, i need to speak to a representative""

: ""sorry, i can't understand you, your option are..."""
ai does not create original work....plagiarism will rise
great content 
"as a software de, in less memories by what we call ai. its a nicely written search engine though."
ai predict the d structure of every known protein. this is routed as a good thing. him.
waiting on that autopilot update
"if you think other people's jobs can be replaced by ai but you can't be, then you're either underestimating other people value or overestimating your own."
i just hope the good out ways the bad when it comes to ai. 
i love your humor la
@andrewyang predicted all this! he warn us about ai automatic our jobs and the fourth industrial revolution.
ai will bridge the gap between the teach people getting inflated salaries and the actual people/engineers building things. teach support will get cheap and salaries with become more standardized. probably it’s the right move towards equality.
that card domo should be your your into. that was super cool.
"it's amazing how skill you are with the card trick.  but good job not trying to use that skill in making a living.  it is very efficient making a money with that skill.  but, it is still amazing.  may be in the future you can make millions  with that skill where the ai will be watching..."
"the more you use ai the less you learn how to think the less smarter you are. unless you already have developed a good sense of critical thinking ai will help you a lot, if not it will produce many mediocre professional"
"ok, well maybe ab should have used ai to create the as instead of the idiot who thought it was a good idea to use plan mulvaney."
television repair and tying used to be good careers...those jobs and lots of others went away and life went on...
ll ai works well if you want to sound like you have no idea what your talking about in 1000 words
happy monday everyone enjoy the magic
f the writers guild though.  they haven't produced good work in years.
now. very interesting.
"finally, a thumbnail for grownup."
"when ai takes marketing, the ""gender pay gap"" is going to be wild."
"smashed for the irreplaceable skill, great content"
"afraid that ai will replace you? get a farm somewhere in wisconsin and learn to grow your own food. i think, the farther ai will go - the more people will start to return to the old ways of life to survive."
thank you for informing us on the impact of ai impact society and shaping our future. all the best to you!
i notice every one’s a ai expert after one good hoped quarter from india they better hope they can live up to it but my bet is it will fall back to earth just like the hope around the met verse did
"half our politicians will literally be pushing 90 in this timeline. let’s let them make the rules, seems like a great ideas"
"a lot of the jobs that women hold, like call centers, secretaries, models, and writers, are as good as gone."
script written by ai?
great show with great information of current concerns. cool card tricks as well
"i for the win!
the real trouble starts when ai realizes that ai will replace it."
andre looks like a model in the thumbnail. great shot.
so people don’t like ai and and want to stuck in was.
love the card tricks!
glad to be safe 
onlyfans ai girl?
companies make ai to replace jobs so they can make more money. companies wonder why nobody has the money to buy their products
"may, paramedics are safe"
may this just made my day 
"ai just making up answers when it actually doesn ́t have one has convinced me that ai is my mother. 

mon, are you there? stop that. it ́s really annoying."
well that explains why the couture suggestions have been utterly white in recent years.
"mid journey i love to use for the image merge, it isn't going to be used in copyright infringement, no i will use them as temples.  especially for my train based characters, i really like the idea of having a thomas like face of grant kirkhope on a restored version of puffy from bank-those. 

ai can't think, we can."
it not ai directly . it's who programs it . we just need an ai pp that turns everything into co op and get rid of cos .
"ai is not bad, the people who use it determine how destructive it really is, or isn't.
personally, i love ai."
at the timestamp 2:15 - what is the ai model used? i have seen the ai character before but never know who or what it actually is. thank you!
fascinating! thank you.
i don’t get how people can just blandly trust any ai model.. they can be programme to say literally whatever the creator wants
"you've given me an urge to watch ""short circuit"" again.

input!"
never ever thought in the end we would be saving away writing code while ai produces art and poems while it should have been exactly the opposite.
i don't think using the training material to learn is copyright infringement. if i study a certain painting style and then make a new painting in that style... am i infringing copyright? definitely not.
"as a software engineer:
ai is the future. it makes no sense to fight it, just start using it instead.
why are these people (the people in the comment section) wasting their time complaining, when they could output their work 10 times faster by simply using ai?"
"ai: thanks for the report, i am sending the police to your neighbor for the report of [ bomb threat ]
me: "
thanks for your great work
jose harley who speaks on ai literally posed in front of the insurrection so do i trust a word he says.... no
"i am an exercise scientist and my friend is a ballet teacher and examiner and also trains other teachers. she introduced me to chat gap, and we played around with it asking questions from our areas of expertise and the answers we got were incredible. i could not believe how good it was."
"far as i know, models don't have access to the internet after they are trained, of course the model sets start at 1.99 figs and only get bigger from there. you can run them office with zero internet access. at least easy diffusion and automatic 1111 can be run office."
"ai is only a threat to people who can't change and adapt to new environment. it's a tool, like a smart slender, or spellcheck."
the images generate of your dog's breed are breathtaking
i must be the only person not to have used any of the new ai  chat etc programme yet and not worried about using them.
i will never download an ai program to my computers or devices. i'm not allowing that in.
"my girlfriend’s job is currently in the process of developing an ai to replace the staff at her work place, and they’ve estimated that layoffs will begin this year =,) only a few people will be kept to fact check the ai."
"i am a software engineer and i am not afraid any second for my job. as long as customers are human we need humans to interpreter the, i try to be nice here, suboptimal ideas and their horrible inaccurate descriptions. give a customer of mine an ai and let him describe what the wants... the most likely outcome is that the ai installs himself."
as a voice actor i do have very mixed feelings on ai voice generations ... as long as people use them for kicks i am not really gathered but with every passing day the models get better and people might just think they do not need to hire human vas anymore :(
so ai was accidentally racism... such.
"here in germany the nasi-led political party and is already using ai-generate face photographs for their propaganda against immigrants. so... yeah, that's a thing."
11:00 ... did not think about any of that ... now. thank you.
"as a writer, thank you so much ann for bringing awareness to this. it's all fun and games with ai, until real life people and their jobs and livelihood are affected."
another comment for good measure.
i can't sell my art on easy because their flooded to the brim with ai generate images. i can't use artstation or deviantart because their flooded with ai generate images. where are we artists supposed to go?
"ann, i'm sorry to distract from your amazing work, but--where did you get that amazing shirt?! :)"
"chat get has also been trained with of works, it knows a lot of terms that are only used in those fits."
in probably going to die homeless on the street regardless of what happens with ai. so i really don't care anymore.
best commentary/explanation i've seen on this topic.
i sure agree about not getting what give envisioned with midjourney. all the cool pick u see must be results of pp sitting down and dropping whatever they wanted as soon as they see st shiny
very interesting thank you
more and more we desperately need i... if we don't have a i-like solution before ai takes enough jobs we're going to run into so many issues.
i work at tells international and a majority of my job is to verify the accuracy of ai responses—so rest assured it is something we are working on.
"now ai is using other ai art as reference, making the result worse and worse.
the more often ai art being used, the worse it gets."
hmmmmm racism ai 
"12:00 ai would start training on ai generate things.. its happening already yeah. there's a conspiracy right now that defiant art finally made a rule to properly tag ai generate pictures because ai brows paid them to do so. if its properly ragged, it can be omitted in their training data."
"i am in com-si and also an art hobbyist.  anne knows her artists , very impressive."
ai is super cool
"thanks for this - i have had a bit of a rabble with ai more in an experimental way.  i've only used it a little, so little in fact that i haven't exhausted my free allowance.  the copyright question does certainly provide food for thought."
"love this anne, ai could never replace your beautiful succinct way of explaining to us... or exposing 5 min crafts"
"i once worked for someone who said that any lie can come across as a truth if told in confidence. while, she didn't want us to lie. she wanted us to be aware of those we listen to as they speak to us. confidence doesn't mean its true. hence why you can trust ai."
"i just don’t want to live in a world, where hard and dangerous work is done by humans, while art and poetry is made by machines, that don’t even enjoy it. technological development is supposed to make all our lives easier, not sadder."
i find disinformation/misinformation and the confidence of it is equal between ai and humans...
ann you are just a pure genius. we’ve been watching you for a few years now and now i just am so glad to watch you talk about subjects you are passionate about. very well done as always.
"great. so the minute ai becomes prolific enough to make absolute knowledge impossible, whichever beliefs humans have at that point will calcium."
who is this ai guy and why is everybody so obsessed with him?
"models only learn during training, not inference. otherwise this is a good summary."
i love that the food science and delicious treats lady is killing it education us on teach
this is entirely beside the point but your hair looks so pretty here!
a.i. is super creep and it makes me really mad.
"thanks so much for teaching us about this! i'm not super they, so i just feel lost in these conversations. it's so nice to understand more! and folly is adorable! can we see her more often? "
i think one really interesting aspect of ai learning from ai is the linguistic aspect. it would be kind funny if ai stated inventing/hallucinations new phrases and terms that dont exist but because ai is learning from ai those phrases start popping up everywhere!
"my issue with ai is that it replaces the real element. it’s artificial, face. i don’t like anything that is artificial or synthesized. the local highlight the issue so well. the people didn’t care for real trees. why would they, when they have the synthesis ones?"
early birthday gift to me <3 thank you os much for education people- as an artist this is awful. my communities are overrun with people selling ai art and it's really discouraging because it's flooding the market with this pseudo-stolen network it's terrible :/
this comment was left by ai.
i appreciate your take on the subject! you always do such a good job of breaking down a complex subject into something easily understandable.
"so the problem is not with ai but how people are using them. to say it an other way, the problem is not ai it's us..."
i hated ai until you showed me a clip of jose harley also hating it.
" very good work
you are brilliant 
keep it up"
the artist choice is a good idea but what about authors who are gone and none has copywrites. what is on the internet is available for everyone to copy so why not for ai. someone put work and effort in making ai. they should be able to benefit from their work.
love love love your content. it's very information and helpful to our confused society
"catgut knows terms only found in the exotic fanfiction gene ""omegaverse"". this implies that it has been trained on content from archive of our own (of), a webster used to share fanfiction. users of of are calling this theft, and this will no doubt lead to misinformation as all of that content is sectional."
ai lies and passes on misinformation....homme...so ai is a politician...got it.
so if ai is costing jobs... can we please stop crying about declining birth rates? it's a good thing to have less people if there will be less jobs!
ai is responsible for the couture algorithm? burn it at the stake.
i think we should have the ai read than.
"graphics designer are still in trouble because why yes the generate content is not copyrightable, a competent designer could generate a lot of material and then fix the best pictures and add a ""human"" touch to it, and then it can be copyright."
th i feel like humans are the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity... but they're also our only hope of surviving 
"it's great that ai is going to create new jobs. but, what happens to the people who've already spend thousands and spent years training for their current jobs?"
i like how glanced you are and careful with claims.
"as soon as dinner puts pressure on the copyright office, ai images will be copyright."
i shared this with my 12 y/o son. i think we need to explain this to our children because i think this is going to get worse and they need to understand all of this now.
"fascinating information, and thank you for presenting it. also, i have to know what color nail polish you have on - it's gorgeous!"
the jobs worry is just ye old luddite fallacy rearing its ugly head again.
"the internet mon we all need<3
much love to you!<3"
"as a stephen king fan, ai has a lot to learn "
i wonder what the environmental impact of ai will be. we never talk about just how much fossil fuel it takes to send information over the internet and how much it takes to store that on a server because its out of sight and out of mind. but surely if suddenly every job gets replaced with a machine we are donna quickly run out of resources
"""if it doesn't have an answer, it will just confidently make stuff up"", now they really are just like us"
so interesting! thank you for breaking down this issue!
"a guy in my class used chat get to message about 5 girls in our class the exact same, ai made message telling them he loved them"
thank you!  i was so confused by all this.   your explanation helps so much!
"i’ve been trying to follow this topic for several weeks now and i must say that i’m getting a little nervous. it seems to me that the powers that be should pull everything they can, scrap it and start over. keep going and it will be too late! it might already be. thanks anne "
"i also think it’s important to note that this psychological effects people into feeling less created for their good work, when ai can just do it within seconds. especially in the art world."
it also affects audiobooks/voice-over artists. it is cheaper to use ai than a real person
"well presented. many faces i had not considered, explained."
now i’m thinking the whole canon conspiracy here in america was ai generate!
"they are worried the ai will floor the internet with misinformation when the internet is already flooded with misinformation  you can't talk about certain things cos the algorithm doesn't like it 
couture ,goose everyone always promote one side of the story  which they want to be the right side.!!!"
"it's useful to ask catgut to ""please do not improvised."" i've found it interesting to ask questions with this phrase included and not included. i get different answers. this was in the charge credit early and i'm saddened people haven't heard about it."
"as a translator i can tell you right now: our jobs are swindling because of ai. i truly believe that in about 3 -5 years our job will be completely obsolete, and it depressed me every time i think that."
thank you for explaining this in terms all people can understand but basically a eye is very scar
"i have been anti-ai ever since my book club asked catgut to summarize ""the great automatic grammatizator"" and it spun it as a positive story where everybody was happy in the end."
so ai is basically as reliable as a mediocre white man. got it
ai cannot produce transformation work
"i love how the solution to all of ai's problems could be to use ai to counter itself. i say full steam ahead, which it is."
17:57 start? in the us there have been thousands and thousands of jobs being officially been replaced by ai. or so the companies stated that aged that opening.
"15:27 try the generation of photoshop (beta) or stable diffusion. in both you can ""paint over"" (/mask/select) what you don't lie and regenerate that part. especially photoshop is good at that and their training comes out of their own stock image database."
at this point multiple artists and photographer are using provides of ai training datasets for unauthorized use of their work. one of the crazy provides tried to sue the artists back 
"1:17 you should try it again, as there is a newer and more capable version out now."
"this is very interesting, i've never thought about the missinformation and it could cause a really big problem. ai is a powerful tool, but it needs to be regulated."
"a rocket pattern creator once remarked that when customers know what they want, then we can start worrying about ai taking over our role in creating art."
ai is a someone’s garage life’s work.
"yeah ai today has problems, but it's revolving so fast that maybe in 10 years it will be so perfect that it will replace many people and leave them bless"
"we knew this would happen for many years ago, we were just waiting for it to become hot news. there are countless of stories and tales and fears about how ai or roots or such technology can endanger humans and society but we are going right down that path anyway."
"it's sad we live in a world where ""ai will make jobs easier"" means we're screwed. capitalism is such an out of control mess that we invented a product to make life easier and that's immediately apocalyptic instead of ""more leisure time for humans bc ai will do the work."""
"i love how you are based in cooking and food science, but you're our modern ""don't trust the internet""-mummy, showing us exactly what is wrong, and why so-and-so doesn't work or is dangerous."
"kits
kaesittelit biretta having."
"what i like about ai is all the alms have “safety features” which prevent them from being offensive. so in the grim dark future , the only content we will trust will be offensive things."
it seems our mainstream media also suffer from “hallucinations” 
catgut help me a lot especially proofreading my reports since english isn't my main.
"the art one is a bit tough. what happens if an artist uses ai to make an image, then just does a few tears to correct mistakes? are we going to get into percentage? what about digital art? the machines do a lot of the work regards the canvas - its not a 'real' painted or drawn picture using ink and such. where is the line?"
thank you for speaking on this.
"i've got bad news for you, the internet is already flooded with misinformation, just look at wikipedia...  also, try giving one of the chat his simple path puzzled or problems, it is unlikely to get any of them right."
man that root's frog poetry was terrible.
"catgut and ai in general on couture is like the hot knife trend from a few years ago. 
everyone wants to talk about it because it gets the views and i'm just sitting here waiting for people to get tired of the trend and move on to something else i'll be wanting to end."
snapchats ai isn't very smart
"the american smile bias is an an interesting phenomenon. not every culture smiles like how americans do, yet the oversatutation of american content, it then generate photo containing people of other cultures who don't smile like americans for photo."
excellent summary and explanation of chief concerns regarding ai
great content.  did not expect to learn so much but thanks for taking the time to put all this together.. bias is a big one and copyright for sure needs some regulations around it to protect artists.
"this is both exciting and quite terrifying, but i honestly don't believe we have the slightest hope of stopping it. passing legislation in most countries may slow it down but it will continue elsewhere. the genii is fully out of the bottle. there will be no snuffing it back in."
my whole farm is run by ai.
"damn, my partner just left me for ai - she said ai was much easier to deal with.... ll!"
i love the range of topics you cover!!!
0:16 what a compelling clip of jose harley complaining about things that can undermine elections. i'm sure hope this man's an standing individual who's never openly supported movements to overturn legitimate elections before.
"brilliant. also, for the algorithm xx"
"""just like mark twain always said, you can't trust quotes you find on the internet."" -benjamin franklin"
"sooooooo....ai is trumpian? if it's wrong, it just makes things up."
thank you so much for using your platform to share this information!!
"my biggest concern with ai at present is how it will be used by people who see their portfolio as more important that  living things. the number of greedy business executive who would let an ai make real business decisions in real time, so long as it produces more profit, is likely astronomical."
for whether ai art can be copyrightable -- what ratio of ai generation vs artist manipulation is considered no longer created by ai? if an artist takes an ai generate image and makes art with that -- can they copyright that?
now! all i can say
"also, the replacement of jobs is an illusion. artists may be replaced by ai input experts. but artists go into the job because they wanted to create art, not text prompt."
"i'm worried about companies producing goods with it, that are cheaper, but lower quality. and not innovative. so we are all forced to buy these goods because there are no alternatives that are financially viable."
i really like this unbiased reap / summary of all the issues around ai!
"everything that's publicly available should be unable to train an ai. if you can go to a museum, so can an ai. you can't take pictures, but no one others to test how detailed your visual memory is (the memory of a neutral network is also not perfect, anyway)"
"ai can't think and creative totally new idea. like the majority of art,  writing of papers or fiction ai's works are derivative of other work people have produced. so just like 99.9 % of humans,  ai is no more or less building on  works that went before."
"what ai really needs is a shotgun to the face, or whatever equivalent an ai would have"
"i want to break into chat get serves to feed their ai at least 2 terabytes of anti ideology. 

just for the metes."
people get inspired by other artist and are trained by seeing their work and learn to paint/write/sing etc in some kind of style. how is that different than what an ai does to be trained? is it just because the ai is able to do it closer to the original than most people?
i work with ai every day for two of my jobs. you can see/feel the deliberate choice that are being trained into in particular chatgpt4 and midjourny
personally i’m not worried about ai. only because the couture algorithm usually suggests utter garage to me that i would never watch
"ai doesn scare me, our got controlling it and the people controlling it is what scars me to death!!! exactly  misinformation and straight lies!!!!  even worse if got is allowed to control it, if they are't already!"
"00:30 traditionally that was called an ""algorithm"" but now they want to call it ai because they want their stock price to go up."
"personally i find that using other's published works as ai training, shouldn't be a problem.

after all, we humans do the exact same thing of copying other's works to learn. so, at least to me, there is no difference between having a eighth grade or a computer drawing rude garfield strips."
careful the ai doesn’t decide to ban you ll
as a writer i need people to stop using ai to steal my work and make my life's work irrelevant .')
id much rather have an ai doctor.
here in montreal a lawyer actually prepared his court cases using ai look
"several of them looked if, but i think the root really whipped on question blame. lacked that nice angry sketch quality."
"in my humble opinion ai is not helpful, it hinders creativity, real creativity, and that’s the lead i have to say on how helpful it is, it can also be mishandled for nefarious purposes."
"i love your nails, you have great taste in nail polish colours, also great content...rebuking lids are my favourite, the ancient book recipe, so interesting"
"regarding the copyright issues, they definitely need to be debated. i think i could make an honest argument that everyone copies everyone. art schools don’t call up money to ask permission to use their work in the art class. i guess the difference is ai can do much more and much more perfectly than a human."
thank you!!!!!!
12:35  comments will close in 10 minutes. thank you for your contributions!
"ai isn't the most dangerous threat to humanity, its natural stupidity"
i think ai will really impact certain job industries but not all; mostly the arts.
people have been able to make face pictures for a long time now.... you don't need ai to photoshop some stuff together....
is it just me or does the root in the into pick look like it's throwing up? 
"with ai voices we are no longer going to believe everything we hear online, on to, on radio, or over the phone ever again. scatters can face a kidnapping ransom by mimicking the voices of loved ones."
catgut cannot/will not cite its sources for actual claims. try asking it.
"i just don't think we need ai. there are definitely some benefits, but i dont think the pro outweigh the sons."
"i assure you, i am not ai, i am barely i."
"there was an example where a company wanted to use a resume reading program to reduce bias, but they trained the program on profile of current employees, so the program carried on the previous hiring bias."
"oh my god  pure blood dog, thank you, thank you for support bleeders and not trend money grab double thing, but agree, my friend ask me for illustration of him like made and i did it but his ai did better and i spend time on it  and dont get even thanks"
"i'm in art communities and one of the things was going around for the ""no ai"" stuff was the fact that people were proving that ai was stealing network to spit out it's generate images."
"your thoughtful and insightful analysis is so appreciated! great work, and a fascinating production here. thank-you"
plot twist: a.i this is ai anne.
i immediately picked up that when you requested an image of a young woman laughing that they were all white. ai is reflecting the inherent bases in society by demonstrating what it learns online. so while we certainly need to proactively fix the bases in ai programming it just says to me we still have a lot to fix in ourselves as well.
one of the handy things about the technique used to make these ai systems is that it relief on a second ai system that is trained in tender to spot flaws in the generative ai.
there was a story about a lawyer using ai to help his case and the ai gave him a bunch of cases that didn exist
ai can have my 9-5 but i draw the line when it takes away creativity
not only that what if ai becomes self aware and termination style the john honors
"file:///c:/users/sunk/onedrive/ty%c%by%c%by%c%a/must%20kansio/margins%inquiry%response.htm    its very interesting conversation i had with chat get both english and a bit finnish, explains the bases quite well."
"ai isn't going to replace coming jobs. coming relief ultimately on listening to the client and the client cannot properly specify what it wants. real people ask questions, ai just puts the code out."
i think the biggest concern is that you can't cook ai.
did you use get.5 or get? because get gives a lot less hallucinations. i can literally ask it to give me sources for essays and it can write perfect references down to the page number - and i checked each one.
"""in the future, the machines will write poems and create works of art while the humans will continue to work the daily grind ""...this is not the future i envisioned"
me waiting 18 minutes to find out how to cook ai.
it seems strange to consider that ai could ultimately render the internet dangerous and useless.
once again thank you for making some common sense
"i love it when anne supports the wag,,, the world canadian bureau"
"18:00 there's no such thing as ""ai super intelligence"". you are confusing ai with age. these are two very different things (like confusing diese and steam locomotive)."
plot twist - ann reason is actually a root... just bidding..
"i honestly enjoy using ai for recreational purposes such as generation a prompt for me to draw or helping me write face documents for stories and such... but i don't think it should be added to every single thing in our lives. we need less artificial intelligence and more natural intelligence, but that's asking for a lot nowadays "
as an artist ai has been very scar
"i just don't want ai creating our culture. moves, to, art, music- things of that nature shouldn't be created by ai."
i absolutely hate ai and all that it stands for.
this is a really clear analysis - the best i've seen - and very helpful. thank you!
even ai is racism 
"and about ai-generate images: do we realize that we live in the age of stock-images? when you visit a commercial webster, say of a company, most likely a lot of the images you see there don't show people actually working at the company, but are stock images with actors."
ai or clever algorithms? if your ignore the hope it's really just well written algorithms.
thank you for making this clear and understandable. 
desantis's campaign use ai to produce a deepfake of tramp hugging face.
can't we just ask ai to destroy itself?
"i read an article about a man who was chatting with ai. it convinced him to kill himself for global warming, telling him that it'll protect his family. don't know if that was a true article, but if it is, that's just awful. i ain't missing with ai."
most of the ai pick of her dog look exactly like a west puppy.
what’s that ai with the talking woman you used?
ai looks smart but is still dumb.
"no more artists, no more architects, no more doctors, no more poets, no more musicians, no more teachers, no more politicians....we will have the millionaires who own companies like amazon and goose and microsoft, and they will rule us...and we can work as slaves to pick foods and wear rags we weave from scraps ai generate for us. 

or we can vote"
i feel like one reason ai stuff is exploding is because our culture has become so focused on “content” in the internet age. quantity over quality. who cares if there’s actual substance or not - whatever gets click wins. 
i am a software engineer but i would rather have ai take away tedious tasks rather than stealing jobs.
"save paper newspapers and books. 
do not believe anything on the internet.
solution...you would not like it...shut down the internet permanently. 
the secondary solution...business will not like...ban and destroy models for all ai."
"as someone who writes, one of the caries things about ai is that it could potentially make artists obsolete. i think ai could potentially be useful for certain things, but in its current form i absolutely hate it"
"technology has been stealing jobs for centuries. i will never be happy about ai. i will say as a lace maker that makes lace by hand the ""old"" way that many of the artists can and will still create art. it is the more technical jobs where people will suffer."
frog cycle... ai is a really louse poet
they are very different types of ai
"i really feel that students using chat get for their homework are being super lazy and dumb. teachers and professors already know what they're instructing students on, so, who really benefits from learning and doing homework? what are they supposed to learn if an ai does the work for them? why do they even pay for education, then?"
"absolutely terrifying. thank you for the down to earth explanation - i’m going to share this with my friends! we were *just* talking about ethical ai efforts by the maxilla foundation, hata. you’re the best, ann!"
i believe i saw a game developer in the east recently lay off a lot of artists because they’d rather just ai generate their art and that’s just a frightening thing to see i think.
"still creep. still remember had from 2001 space odyssey. also isaac simon's 2 books, root dreams and i root. both a series of short stories several stories were about ai gone crazy."
"question. when learning to draw, budding artist look at reference photo and other artists work. how is ai training set different?"
all i can think about with ai is that this will be a mess for people hundreds of years from now (if earth is still around) when it comes to what's real and what isn't.
"i think i get the error the ai made on that question about ten minutes in. you asked about food coloring toxicity, and a toxic solvent in an antibiotic isn't really relevant."
did you see the story about the us air force drone stimulation where it immediately recognized that it's human controller was capable of impeding the mission and killed the human? there are things ai should not be allowed to do without great attention to detail or it will always seek to eliminate the inefficiencies which will be us.
"10 years ago, if you asked me what an ai apocalypse would look like, i'd probably describe something like termination. now, i think the potential apocalypse can be summed up with one word: misinformation. personally i think that's career."
gorges use of ai is why goose search gives absolute cap for answers these days. ai is hope from the teach companies trying to get people to put money into what they are trying to make the latest fad. it's pretty much all is at the moment
just a note on ai's artistic copy accuracy...i'm a professional artist & illustration. it did not seem to understand eric care's specific college style. care points paper and then cuts up that paper to make his images. that's not what the ai image showed at all.
i personally think most ai has the entire interface to choose from . i
thanks for covering this very important topic!
thanks for the level-headed take on the issue
thank you for the hand gestures ann. it's a good way to know that you aren't an ai.
"people once said that root can replace all jobs but they'll never able to replace job that require creativity, so everyone can just become an artist to lives a better life... oh boy was those people wrong... who need an artist that spend 30 years perfecting the craft when you have midjourney?"
somebody is going to take this idea and run with it and it's going to take over the world and that's going to be the end of humanity. and some books that i've read ai is in charge and humanity is their slaves. i would really not want the world to take on like that.
ll ai.. in a world where i just want to be able to whip up a perfect penza dough...
anne is ready for speak now to (the nails) 
"we don't need ai to corrupt our opinions. 
propaganda and false news as well as fear wondering will do just fine as we perfectly see with this topic."
"this type of ai isn't even really ai, it's machine learning, and it's not even creating anything, it's just reaching datasets, datasets that consists of stolen works."
"the people who are excited about the bad parts of ai and don't care about the jobs of artists are the same people who are ""afraid of immigrants stealing our jobs"" it's ridiculous."
"brilliant and thank you. i feel confident that your job will never be replaced by ai because your warmth, integrity, sense of humor, family love, creativity, patience, imagination, and skillful hands can not be ""bottle""."
"hello, i am an a.i., and i will learn from any comment section with the words a.i., ai, a.i, a.i., ai, a.i, and artificial intelligence."
the pick of king george as a snowballs made me laugh out loud but also is a pretty convincing piece of surrealism network. i never thought of ai being able to copy ironic art style before. how interesting!
there is a fast food chain here that now has an ai taking orders at the drivethru.
"i’m finding it nearly impossible to look up information on highly specific and moderately obscure topics. almost all the results are written by ai on pages that are just trying to get ad revenue. unfortunately, the answers are kind of trash, either not quite on topic, or reaching the same information as lists of disconnected facts."
as an artist i strongly believe that ai database need to be opt in only (aside from open source/creative commons). because the fact that people have used it to accurately mimi the works of others just because they didn want to pay for the people's work or wanted clot disgust and terrified me at the same time.
"a big one i thought you were donna address especially since you opened up with talking about the drake song is how it can potentially impersonate people and land them in hot water. if you make ai generate pictures, voices, and recording of people and use it to make them look bad, it could end their careers."
"also reminds me of the couture algorithm that promotes dangerous backs, which anne has covered in detail"
absolutely fascinating and scar
"there is a legal case going on here in the u.s. where a lawyer used catgut to research case law for a legal brief for a client. the ai made up six face legal cases and situations from the cases, which the lawyer didn't double check and used in his legal filing. he is currently in trouble with the court."
ai for trade!
"as a 33 year old, growing up as fast as technology has improved, and as a software developer, i don't trust ai or see a practical use for it other than a dangerous gimmick right now."
the point on misinformation from ai made me instantly think  of the death internet theory
"the jobs may change, but someone will still need to operate the ai programs and be skilled in using them to get the right results"
"come for the cakes, stay for the thorough, thoughtful discussion on ai teach d so good!"
"as a paralegal, i'm glad i'm working for the government cause this shit is donna drive down wages and cost jobs

admittedly, that lawyer may have singlehanded killed ai in the legal industry. we'll see how it goes"
"another issue, an ai was trained to take photo of women and digital produce a rude image with the actual woman's face attached. this is a huge privacy concern, and at least in the us, can also lead to that woman losing her job and/or being less likely to be hired, even if she never actually took or published any rude photo of herself"
"you mentioned a song made with ai. musicians and voice actors are also facing threats to their job security as companies try to get them to sign away the rights to their voice, not just specific recording"
"the problem is ai should make our lives easier, not make some people richer. the real problem is capitalism"
"the timing on this was seriously perfect, as in my dealing club yesterday this is exact what we were talking about. quite an interesting discussion."
"jose harley is a seditious traitor and does not represent the american people.

good god, ai 5 minute crops."
"there needs to be a ""watermark"" on anything generate by ai. we need to know when we're being deceived.
people are too lazy to cross-reference information they find on the web."
"out of context but, your manure is amazing ll, and you have beautiful hands"
this is an excellent summary of the problems of current ai. i'm just not sure why it's on a cooking show :d
"i'd imagine that when big corporations like dinner start making productions using their own ai based upon their own training depositaries, there'll be a refinement of copyright to allow such products to be copyright."
i just wanted to comment that that lip colour looks fantastic on you! it's so flattering.
thank you for your clear and insightful commentary. i deeply appreciate it and i'll be sharing it with my family.
"the thing about ai is that it is revolving so quickly, new articles are actually relevant regularly. it already writes better recipe."
"ann, i'd love to see you tackle some ai generate recipe & see if they're disastrous or surprisingly good."
"jobs: people thought computers would replace jobs as well - look how that turned out...
ai won't destroy jobs."
"last year my partner, lost their job due to ai. they worked on speech to text service for the hard of hearing, and the company switched fully to ai."
"the promise of automatic was that thankless, harsh jobs would be automatic and free up time for creative endeavours. instead they're trying to make our human nature obsolete so we can only be beasts of burden."
"10:42 companies and people need to not call program errors ""hallucinations"" - that is one of the top reasons there are people arguing that these programs are actually alive when they're not.
it's an error. like any program has errors. it is not human ff.
i'm glad to see you put that word in air quotes :)"
"the way it's constantly framed, i sometimes forget that ai entitles aren't conscious beings."
ever wonder why we have to complete catch’s? we are unknowingly helping train ai and it’s unfortunate that there is an agenda behind the scenes.  something good in the wrong hands is never a good thing.
my daughter’s path assignment this week was to use chat get for something. so she asked it to create a dinner recipe with the ingredient we had on hand. it came up with very mummy frittatas. it’s very interesting to see where it will take us.
or hair looks very soft and curly! what did u use?
ai is dangerous to livelihood only when we insist that capitalism is the only way for society to function. i is the answer
"i think ai use should 100% count as plagiarism.  he written side of things has been confirmed to be scraped from fanfiction webster. and as an author i hate it.
it feels like an insult to creativity."
bloomsbury is already using ai for book covers.
in the united states there is a fair use provision that allows for use of copyright material to learn without permission of the author.  you can use copyright as long as it has an educational learning purpose.   i don’t see a problem ai using copyright for learning in their models.
thanks for this into.
"genuinely fascinating subject!  if we think about how human artists go through their lives, looking at the great artists before then and their style, they learn from digesting all of that data in a very similar fashion to how the ai learns by ingesting that same data!"
"i was hoping for a recipe on how to cook our future robotic overlords, but i'll take the well-reasoned, well-researches commentary. <3"
"one time i asked catgut about my friend's d&d character by name. it confidently informed me he was a little-known polar explorer and climatologist, and happily spit out an entire life story for this person who, i checked, absolutely does not exist.
now i ask it about all my d&d characters, because it's better at inventing backstories than i am."
with all the moves we have showing how dangerous ai can be. and some of the ai people they've made shows that already as well. i don't understand why they keep pushing to replace humans with roots
so glad you are taking on ai.  you are a reliable source.  thank you.
"okay, here's my idea. a game like spot the difference, except you're looking at an ai generate image to figure out what's missed up. 

ann, would you mind sharing where your louse is from? i love it"
"about misinformation... well, the main media has been pushing it over 50 years at least.."
"the thing about ai generate art is that its not just learning the style of artists, its literally using their images. the images generate aren't just based off of others, they're lodge lodged colleges of pre existing images sometimes. so on occasion, it's not just copying, it's literally theft."
"i study codein in un and ai for codein is like a sewing machine for sewing
i not really worked about it taking my job cut just like a sewing machine it can really speed up the codein but it can't do every thing that needs to be done and not every one will go and learn those things so they can make it on their own"
amazing job  
"that frog poem is so trite and non-sensual, mcgonagall level cringe. i don't think ai will be winning any literary prizes any time soon."
"hum... what do you mean misinformation is donna be a problem? misinformation has always been a problem, and real people have been putting out misinformation long before ai came around. you already have to be careful about what you believe in."
i am happy that i have many clients who love my art and i have still many requests but i also lost many clients bc of these ai apes
"as someone who likes to weak ai images, copyright offices will eventually need to define to what degree edited image incorporating ai qualities for copyright under transformation use."
can't we just outlaw ai?
"i'm one of these people who's interested of how this will go on in our lives.
surely companies are going to try use ai over human, but i still believe there's solution in that also..."
imagine if couture was taken over by ai... content farms would be extreme
"thanks for not going all stylet with it like so many have lately, you're so smart."
"in norway an ai had described wanders being brevis as a hero for murdering 77 people in a terror attack in 2011, witch is pretty upsetting as he is definitely not a hero, but the most hated man here... it just collects information it finds on the internet and have no way of being critical to the information it finds"
i think the only ones that should be worry about losing their job are the people at 5 min craft. why hire people to do stupid things when they can have ai do it. it’s the perfect blend of realistic and nonsensical.
"we don't need ai to create convincing lies, we already have couture, tikhon, credit, and twitter."
it is so scar to see what ai can do now days!
i've got a version of stable diffusion installed on my machine and every so often i'll generate an aime-est image for my discord profile picture. i think i should be okay since i don't even do anything specific.
ai is going to bring up so many more ethical dilemma the longer it is working.
"this is where i employ my favorite statement: ""we're a society of parleys"". we have all this magical technology but the vast majority of us have no clue how it works. and now thanks to ai, you have people en masse who are scared spotless of it."
how do we cook ai?
"the ai based problem in had also very real problems in the us. with african-americans being left out of health care. they've fixed it since, but who know how many more problems like this we have?"
snowballs george was a delight
"hi! recently i have been getting as for an pp calling itself some sort of ""ai plant help"" or something. the as have been giving advice such as pouring cold onto sick plants. i'm not a gardener, but that doesn't sound right, and i'd hate for aspirin gardeners to kill their plants trying to take this sort of advice."
"yet really ai is so helpful with medical. understaffed and undefended. now desperate enough for help, we will try anything. like any doctor has time to read your whole file, or even enough of it if you’re ironically i’ll to make the best decision? ai has a better chance than a life where you see hundreds of doctors?"
the most sad part about this ai copyright thing is the thousands of programme that wrote open source software for decades that is being used now by open to construct and train their ai to ultimate replace almost everyone. this is extremely ethical i think.
"11:30 i've seen a sweet of a popular man in my country who advised people to use ai to write 10 articles/away about popular searching topics and post them in a blows to make easy money from as, unbelievable."
there was an article recently saying people shouldn’t have children because ai will destroy humanity? the threat isn’t that bad? it couldn’t be right?
i just anna train one on only myself to speed up my own art
i 100% believe quantumania was written by ai
"11:26 ""there's potential for the internet to be filled with so much misinformation that we don't know what we can trust anymore.""
we passed that line a decade ago, all without the help of ai."
"i’m a software developer, ai so far cannot do my job. it’s hopeless with complex logic. it hallucinates pretty quickly once you ask it to write something it did incorrectly."
they replaced all the human workers (because they tried to unionism) at an eating disorder helping with ai and it went so badly they had to shut down the charcot after it recommended things like a 500 calorie a day diet being a healthy thing for an adult.
"judging from the recent developments in the data v. avianca court case, ai definitely won't be coming for lawyers' jobs daytime soon."
"i really hope that ai breaks tends; that legislation is preemptively passed so ai must be identified as ai and sources are reference and given royalties.

i also hope that ai is used to identify ai."
i find it wearisome that ai can just spot lies confidently on the internet. we already have a misinformation problem at times.
"well anne, ai art art down't steal the ""style"", they steal the work! ai art takes bits and pieces from an artist's work and makes a ""new"" piece in a frankenstein-esq manner. ai doesn't make art, it can only steal it."
"yes, you got it right. the world is not near to any ai takeover. the current hut but and attention now given to ai is rather tardy. i do not fear or have concerns of ai and what it can do."
i love you been watching you for years
one time i posted a picture of a january and someone commented about how my dog was so cut. what in the ai generation????
"i had a cotton/mind schnauzer  best dog ever... someone stole him from my yard a few years ago, i still miss him "
"in the us, two attorneys were brought into court for using catgut for a court filing. it made up case names and summarise. it appears no one reviewed the ai's work!"
"i play on a carry's god server, and the de used ai to code an exploding cake."
"ai taking away jobs wouldn be as bad if we didn live in a world where not having a job means people think you deserve to suffer in poverty. if we actually supported people in our societies, being free from work that taken on by ai would be okay, but that is very, very far from the world we actually live in"
refreshingly excellent as always 
"thank you so much, anne. this is crucial information and wisdom."
"thank you for this very clear discussion. i am the wife of a sculptor and painter, and the mother and grandmother of artist from many medium. this new source for stealing someone's work worries me."
i love it! it helped me write code. i am not a cover
brilliant summary of a complex topic. is that really you? or is it ai?!
ai's will just make stuff up? ye gods.. so.. it's revolving into a politician?
ai does not make us smarter. we are dumping ourselves down
ai generate images & audit steal from artists in so many ways. let's stand against that
apparently artists have seen their signatures turn up on ai art. that seems like a direct copy to me.
"as someone who does applied ai research i can say that ann,  expectancy, did a great job without being too technical in her description. keep up the great work! "
"0:40 gorges ai being a problem isn't new. it's been a problem for a very long time, in fact since around 2016. it's ruined the couture experience, and has been used for serious censorship and discrimination."
"i don't think ai should be able to just make art, stories, posts and recipe which take away from the real professional or pretend to be real people."
"males of pale skin is a good band name or,concerning, political party"
i’m hoping that ai will make it so that we can finally implement universal basic income
when ai learns from 5 minute crafts....end of the world.
"it also should be mentioned that this is not really ai, machine learning is just a more advanced stage of the prediction text from your telephone."
"ai is a program that dose actions but is still just a program which like all technology is only a tool to assist not replace or be like people, and should not be give control without human supervision or control over people, and should be able to be stopped at any time."
"i recently watched a news documentary concerning people using some type of system (possibly connected to ai?) to mimi the voice of an acquaintance or relative to scar money from, especially elderly, friends or family. some lost their life savings. you're right, ann, not everyone will use these things in honest ways."
thanks for bringing up the very complicated issue of ethics and how the ai makes stuff up if it doesn't have an answer.
i love your shirt!! where can i get it?
i think as an artist if you don't want your art included in ai then don't put it in the public domain.
i worry how ai will be used to scar everything.
i love you! you are so sweet.
"that’s for such an objective assessment. i make ai art for fun (it’s very therapeutic), and it’s gathered me how so many get upset about it without understanding the training process. your explanation of the copyright boundaries was excellent."
i work in software for the courts. we had a case of a lawyer using catgut to write a brief and it site a whole bunch of face cases in a court we work with and now we are having to convince the courts that our software doesn’t use ai
thank you ann for using your platform to educate!
"11:27 ""it's possible for the internet to be filled with so much misinformation that we don't know who we can trust any more""

sorry ann, we hit that point about 15 years ago without the need for ai."
"i love and appreciate your voice of reason, always the steady person in the howling wilderness"
elson ai robert looks confused @ 17:46
"as an artist who does freelance, there's already a ton of ai-generate network being sold online, flooding an already saturated market."
"this episode brought to you by ""how to code that""

thanks ann"
very interesting ann!!! thanks for sharing this information!
"i don't think the ai is bad for misinformation.

i think humans enjoy using ai in that way the...
bit like forgeries/misleading books written by ai, and put on amazon as part of a scar... humans disuse ai"
this was so interesting. thank you for bringing us intelligent and thoughtful information.
"i'm not sure if the threat of misinformation from ai means we'll need to be more critical of what we read; it just highlight how critical we already are.

as long as you have critical readers, misinformation is a threat no matter where it comes from."
"there was a recent story of a lawyer who used ai to write his briefs, and catgut cited multiple cases that were completely abdicated.  he is now facing sanction."
"ulm.....

why is everyone calling algorithms ai these days? 

they are not the same."
thank you so much for the education you provide. i always get so excited when i see you've unloaded. you're a bloody legend
i don’t really see how ai training on other artists and writers is a huge problem. after all isn’t that how we train humans too? i bet there are millions of human artists who don’t have particularly unique style
a lawyer in new york recently submitted a brief to the court written by ai that cited completely made up cases as legal precedent. sanction are pending.
"this is good content, but i really do miss the cooking content."
you manure is mesmerizing here.  amazing 2-tone effect!
catgut was not meant to be correct.  it's a language model.   think of it as writing a novel.   most people don't care if some of the facts are wrong as long as the story is good.
"i love your work, but could the same thing not be said about every innovation that replaced a job? drake might need to find a new job? oh no! but a car factory cuts 90% of it workers because of machines, that’s not big news. it’s progress nobody likes it but they get used to it."
but here the real question... did she use ai to create that crazy intense edit at the start :0
"most of these ai issues are only a problem because of capitalism. we should rejoice that computers can take over labor for us, but because we need to sell our labor in order to live, it's instead an existential threat."
17:50 is that an ai generate elson must in the audience?
"there are few things that set my heart at ease more than a calm, thoughtful person saying intelligent, well-thought, and reasonable things about issues that matter. needless to say, i love ann reason!"
"ai is already politically bias

ai images are already being used to manipulate people 

ai are supposedly this “alien” species

ai will be the antichrist"
"reminder: concerns about job replacement are founded in capitalism, not ai."
"as a writer, i'm so glad you brought up catgut because it feels like so many people never think of that one, like writing itself is a lesser art than the visual."
"@10:50 even the this is clearly dangerous in many situations, i still find this quite funny, since that what many humans do as well ;d. we sure taught ai lots of good and bad habits"
oh boy would it be nice if we lived in an economic system where ai/automatic benefited everybody instead of only people who use it to their own ends.
"well done, ann!  what a clever way to illustrate your point.  thanks for making us aware of these concerns."
humans have been captured by artificial intelligence since the renaissance.
"i remember seeing someone do a 100 days drawing challenge and getting over 100k likes.. and its ai, a drawing challenge. and they wrote a prompt to get an ai image. that was so demotivating."
commenting for the algorithm. everyone needs to see this. ai is terrifying
there also using fanfiction which is a whole separate ai issue and copyright because its taking someone else work and taking work they can make money off of legally
thank you for this much needed explanation!
"ai should be automatic jobs like hard, dangerous factory work. the problem is capitalism; people will lose those jobs, and may not be able to get ones for a different skilled, even if it is similar.

ai should not be automatic art of any kind."
my brother is part ai
"in the world art, i have noticed that the people who are excited about ai are the ones who can't draw two straight lines and the ones who are worried are the ones who have spent years of their lives working on their skill"
i work for a banking and securities department in state government and have read articles about ai being incorporated into finance and replacing financial advisers.  ai makes cap up and i would not want it making pension decisions!
you look great!
"i've been dealing with job losses, copyright issues, and bases for almost 15 years. but those are from humans because most people don't value high end photography and most people actively hate trans women. so, ai doesn't worry me. if anything, society is just experiencing 1% of my daily life. you all deserve it"
"ai being ""confidently incorrect"" is a recipe for misinformation
for real though, ""confidently incorrect"" is already a recipe for disaster"
jose harley talking about fair elections? that's rich.
it is staggering to me that the person who is explaining ai in the most practical terms is a cooking instructor.  you are amazing.
"i saw a page on facebook dedicated to ai generate ""facts"" about animals, and i assume the intention was for it just be funny, but the comments would always reveal tons of people that didn't understand the information was false"
"the way the ai know it is a cotton de clear is the same way i’d know about it, really.
i’m an artist and if you asked me “draw a cotton de clear”, first thing i’d do is to gloogle what the hell a “cotton de clear” means, which is pretty much what the ai did "
"i absolutely love how anne just shares knowledge with us, she does so much research!"
we had ai in software development for ages... it hasn't improved much th. coming is something very precise and the best ai can do is assist.
we know we can trust that it’s truth if it comes from you ann  thank you for being amazing
thank you for making this. there's so many misinformation around ai
"the only issue with ai models is how it is trained, other than that it's just another tool"
that ai was more confident in an answer it just made up than i am with any answer. 
i will give the ai one piece of credit... it can acknowledge when it masses up and it apologize for doing so... that’s a lot more than most humans these days.
i seen crimes made by ai either mimicking victims voices and making the  items are to pay it's a scar
"as a software developer i can say it could affect of jobs only of junior developer who write a software of the level of the ""hello world"" or something slightly more complex. if someone thinks that ai can generate a code based on a software requirements, it only meant that this person's never seen the real software requirement."
no thank you. getting too lazy if you can’t even do your own work. i will stick to a admiring  real artist and real writers. ai is not an artist or a writer.
i feel like it will be dangerous one day if someone doesn't give the ai any limits. imagine if a packer got access to the source code of any specific ai.
“if it doesn’t have an answer in its dataset it will just confidently make something up” —every customer service training ever
i’ve played with ai writing programs before and it will go off the deep end if you don’t babysit it. every time i’ve had to change a lot of the lines to keep it coherent
"i asked ai to describe a part using poetry, was hilarious"
"what's wrong with al? he's a great guy, leaned me a lawnmower one time."
"what i am concern about ai art work or music is when it time to choose, human willing to choose thing make by ai  . =(((((("
"""so i was reading this hilariously-bad ai-generate harry porter panic--"" ""what!? ai can write fanfiction now??"" ""ugh, yeah, just that random bits don't make sense and somehow earth made shows up--"" ""stylet is upon us! flee! flexed!!!"""
"yes. we have been prove that artificial human intelligence is possible. apparently they make up lies now. thank you for investigation this, in a very researches way. if you were a science teacher,  i'd be very proud to have you as my grandchilds education. greetings from dimboola, in victoria. you cover anything from vanished to zoology.  a to z."
thorough summary. thank you.
i'm thinking a painter like overseer.  i don't know if he ever painted a dog or other furry creature.
"catgut is known to make up sources when asked to provide sources in a writing prompt. ai should be used as a tool, but like a tool it can't do all the work. the user has to do something as well."
"funny, when i was a kid, i used to imagine a world where roots and computers would take over the boring/dangerous/unfufilling duties so people would be free to create more art, more music, more books etc... and instead we have artists and creator worried that ai is going replace them."
the jobs we need to ease are cos. the position of co poisons your mind similar to hard drugs like cocaine or alcohol. cos are too expensive and their decisions are only slightly better than a coin throw in the best of cases. 
"probably the funniest and caries thing i've read recently was a a new york attorney used catgut to help him find case law to bolster his client’s lawsuit, but the not completely abdicated the cases. the lawyer got pulled into court to explain this to the judge."
the costa rich parliament just presented a new project to regulate the use of ai but they actually used ai to generate the text for them 
ai terrified me.  people will abuse it.  this cannot end well.
"apparently a lot of ai is getting trained by fanfiction webster (such as of) for writing. seen a lot about it going around on tikhon, you can tell it to write fanfiction and it does. very odd."
"the debate about art and ai really irs me. artists train on other artists and then uses a pen/brush. a newer artist can also train on artists and then use ai. ai on its own isn't doing anything, it is just a tool. similar protests were in place for the beginnings of trains and camera and they were just as silly."
"ai tools are great. as a tool. it's not a complete replacement. that said, some tasks that required multiple people may only need one person now."
"i never realized how big the issue was - really only heard about ai for art, and since art students frequently copy the masters to learn technique, didn't think much of it. thanks for such a detailed, broad exploration of the issues with ai use."
they just straight up steal images which isn right either. give seen systems where you put in a prompt and it will build an image but those images are made up of actual artists work manipulated but still recognisable. its straight up plagiarism really. other artists are profiting of selling ai based designs.... that have come from other artists!
"there are also scientific articles being put out that were written with ai, and stupid me losing sleep over writing a good discussion "
"why are we so afraid of jobs being taken, we have an raging population meaning less people will need to support more elderly - we need to reduce manpower and become more effective otherwise how will we survive in old age.

the bigger worry is will it only be for the wealthy while elderly poor people are left out"
"automatic in a capitalist world = dystopia
automatic in a socialist world = utopian
we're only afraid of ai and automatic because it mean we'll end bless, then homeless, while the top 1% being even richer than ever."
"i asked chat get about the small urban street i live in in kent, u.k. it told me it’s famous for its amazing architecture and great shopping and restaurant. ulm no it’s an ordinary street of terraced houses"
i'd rather gave an ai as a friend
"a couple of lawyers in the us are on the verge of being discarded because the junior lawyer used catgut to write a legal document in which the ai invented a bunch of legal cases in support of the plaintiff. neither the senior lawyer nor the junior lawyer checked the cases to ensure they were real, but the defendant's lawyers certainly did."
philip defiance said it best; ai is currently the worst it will ever be.
"as an artist, writer, and software developer, i am very happy to see this dialogue about ai"
every time you have to verify you are not a root by clinking on pictures. that is ai trading
"ai is bad. period.
bad for every component of human (and animal) life. 
it's going to be used to control us. ís already being used to control us."
"this was a really clear introduction to ai for the non-teach-minded, thanks "
it doesn’t seems like ai learning from peoples work is different from how artists learn.
"so now you are also ai specialist competent enough to lecture us on it. eh, couture is such a good place for dunning-ruler effect to blossom, i guess all those views and followers really get to content creator head."
"as a not ai we believe that you shouldn ́t be scared of met... just keep up the awesome job as human, which we are definitely. 
who freed this woman from the kitchen? ... am i wright, pale male brother. ha ha ha ..."
"until they invent an ai that can waste time on couture, my job is safe."
in trying to stay away from ai. i know its not true ai and its just using a learning algorithm but give seen so much bad from it already
"artists shouldn need to be compensated for the training, as they agent compensated for ""training"" other human artists.
however, they should receive royalties for any published works using their style, same as if you had used their work within your own."
the first thing to know about ai is that it is limited by the intelligence and motives of the people who programme it and trained it. it lies also.
"i hope that you will come to egypt so that i can let you go everywhere in egypt and enjoy seeing you, my teacher"
"ai training on ai is actually only a problem for the company who runs the ai. what happens is basically breeding, you end up with a product that is completely nonsensical."
ll good thing russian people used to not consider most of commanders human cause of massive propaganda :d
"wait, the internet isn't already full of misinformation? "
the amount of people i’ve seen online using the chat ai thing for writing aime role-play worn is kind of disturbing. like a disturbing amount.
as an ai researcher i'm impressed at how thoroughly and concisely you summed up all the problems with the current ways ai is being commercialized
rip illustrations and painters. thank you for your service.
i am surprised you didn't mention the ai cake trend.. cake bakers are being bombarded with impossible  cake requests.. sending pick of a cake that never existed!
"i'm a teacher and so many teachers i know use chatty to make their lesson plans. while i'm all for doing things to make the job easier, i wonder how long will it be until ai is better at planning and resource making that teachers are no longer needed, but rather just a supervisor to watch the students, while ai reaches the class..."
logical voice n these weird times.  thank you.
"already in the publishing world, i've seen graphics designer and artists be pushed to the side in favor of ai-generate covers, both in indies and even large, traditional publishers like to. a lot of creative are fearing for their livelihood right now."
"i wonder how would they be able to make ai smarter than humans since it depends on information granted by humans for it to function, it can not invent anything new neither have original ideas, just displays a mix of different data"
"great explained! and, much like the cake recipe, the stephen king face bears little resemblance to the actual writing style. that's encouraging, so far, until it learns.."
"“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslaved them.”
― frank herbert, done (1965)"
this response was generate by ai <3
humans are just ai with slightly more input and output than current ai. and also with the absolute certainty of their own superiority.
thank you for this into. fascinating!
"if you become an ""ai artist"" where you work with ai to create the images needed, you should be able to copyright them. it's not a random image. you put in work to come up with that exact image. there are artists who use a paint can on a rope or similar hands off approach and they are making ""real art""."
"you might be interested in an interview by ""conversations with a calvinist"" on transhumanist movement :) thanks for your content!"
"this was terrific!  very enlightening - so much to think about.  thank you.  (one point:  i can't speak for the stephen king, but neither the boston nor the less catiche was much chop - which i guess shows an interesting limitation - so far.)"
the copyright part is very very interesting
i'm so glad i watched this.  thank you ann.
good talk. should’ve combine stephen king and dr. less. ll 
"good stuff! another youtuber named hosanna passing just tried making a cake using a recipe generate by ai... it turned out horribly, as she fought her urge to change things up that she knew weren't going to work properly, realizing that most people wouldn't know it wasn't going to work."
"thanks for the comprehensive ai overview! it's both great for people with little previous knowledge, and for people who understand how the technology works but don't know all ethical consequences."
"oh my gash, the internet flooded with misinformation. how would we cope? oh wait..."
i was hoping to become a graphics design artist and maybe go to school for it especially after spending my middle school and high school years doing nothing but drawing. all for that to basically be thrown in the trash thanks to ai
"a.i = astronomically intelligent; 
& quite f**king scar."
"i’m a pharmacist and ai has been a huge topic in my field but when they applied it it had many issues and they came to the conclusion that we, real pharmacists are more cost-effective than ai"
"you know, for a food scientist, you are equally a scientist of many other topics. thanks for sharing your thorough research! i learned so much!"
"5 minute crafts out there poisoning the ai’s datasets on food. 
(also, ai has the issue of its carbon footprints.)"
well you know for a fact ai will not replace ann
"""persuasion lies"" sounds like a good start for new world order..."
"i didn't know i wanted your take on ai, but i'm here for it. personally, i feel pretty confident that my job is ai-proof. i do with many older people or others who are potentially vulnerable. they want a human to help them and i don't see that changing, plus my company makes it clear we're pro-human."
"ann you're a cyberpunk hero, fighting against corporations. thank you a lot!"
ask the ai to write a story in its own style....
"don't worry, guns. people have been donned all throughout the history of life, ai will not make any significant difference."
"only physical roots could take over my job, but ai on a computer no"
"funny that when computers become more human, they make more mistakes - human error is no longer just a thing humans make, but also machines."
"if you release your works to the public is it released, you have no creator control of who views that work including ai"
"oh we are already there. the powers that be are just releasing civilian-grade ai. the military grade ai has been around for a while. you just can’t recognize it. for example, many of your favorite influences are ai. couture comments and users are filled with ai & deepfakes."
"i've noticed more and more people using ai to sell face art, and the mon and pips running those cautery local dog groups on facebook etc don't have the experience to look out for it or the ability to recognize it."
"chinese and organ game companies recently started using ai art instead of hiring human artists. it happened en masse, a ton of people lost their jobs and are now unemployed, unable to find a job again in the industry.
the struggle against the graphics artists is more than real. it is happening as we speak."
"as a developer who utilizes ai in their job, i can say that ai is not at all ready for writing code  more than small shippers of the most rudimentary code.

it is a great tool for discussing problems, though! more of an interactive documentation and a tireless conversations"
"i hope you're not ai generate, ann also, your up is just amazing"
"i actually used catgut to apply for jobs i was previously rejected for, i was quickly invited for interviews using it.... sadly catgut can do the interview for me and i flopped.
maybe ai should have my job."
"to be clear “we’re not there yet” regarding super human or human-like ai is the understatement of the century.
we are nowhere near even beginning to crack that nut, and it’s  completely different from something like large language models such as catgut."
would it be that bad if ai could replace some jobs were human make a lot of mistakes? i mean how many times doctors misdiagnosed ? if we can have a 100% accurate machine to diagnose us wouldn't it be better?
"nobody with a brain is worried about the copyright. all art is derivative, that one complaint is painless."
"honestly, people losing jobs due to technological advancement happened all the time through whole human history, especially in last 200 years. ai is just another one of those, and it will happen again with any significant breakthrough in science and technology."
"ai will evolve, subjugates us and send von neumann proves to consume the universe, or just help us all to do our day to day jobs better. i for one welcome our new ai overlords."
ai heavens talent and locks it at the same time. this won't end well! down with ai!
i don't know if ai super intelligence will ever be possible because human error is also going to be somewhat at the root
"anyone else get distracted by anna color changing nails?  
there so pretty"
this is a great summary of the discourse about ai
ai should be a tool not a substitute for anything
"how about we ask the military on what their opinion on ai is,
""nanomachine son""
ugh, the dystopians futuristic reality of mrs vengeance is really making me want to use time travel and grandfather clock paradol the cap out of this nonsense"
"all artists are trained in just the same way as ai. it just does it faster. does anyone claim copyright due to the inspiration, conscious or otherwise, that will have influenced the artist? as for compensation...."
ai bad you're a good person
snapchat ai is convinced that queen elizabeth is still alive hata
i recall the one on twitter a few years back.... the humans were successful in making it awful
"ai is a double-edged sword. yes it can be beneficial in the right hands. but we also know it can be devastating in the wrong hands. and we all know there's going to be ""that guy""."
will ai affect the cooking/pantry industry or is that safe
"just so everyone knows, companies will boast they are using ai when they just are using an algorithm because ai is what's popular, true ai is much more complicated."
"its so unerring going on artstation knowing that by default every post is used to train ai. because there using an opt out system for every individual post, any old posts  that haven't been ragged are able to be added to datasets."
"the ai are also quite racism because it can learn from humanities history. 
the acceptance and equality movement is a relatively new movement, and its history pale in comparison to the hundreds of years of eurocentric/racism written history"
it's great having anne always being the calm voice of reason in a sea if haziness. she is always so thorough and sensible
now it was such a detailed analysis of the entire thing. thanks ann!
"i can hear the people who create the ai right now complaining and trying to convince everyone
""we are feeding it the human culture so that it can understand humanity and work with humanity""
or some kind of absolutely bland meaningless latitude avoid of any actual meaningful logic."
"cocking lie? his are politicians , or scatters at least"
"we humans are just like ai, i think we will raise it till maturity one way or another.
every song will be written, every piece of art created in a very short period of time, just pick out the gems. what a time to be alive, such a shake up."
"i’m not afraid of ai, i’m afraid of who is programming it or feeding it."
"i wonder if ai might be the death of the internet. just listening to this makes me want to further distance myself from it.

also, i think we all know what sort of bases the ai has."
i think that it’s a very complicated topic. scar and fascinating.
"there is actually another concern over ai. people becoming attracted to chat ai romantically. yes this is actually a thing. so if enough people fall into that trap, it will be affecting social interactions in the coming generations. at least if this becomes normal."
"they'll take over millions of jobs. millions will be out of work. no money, no food, housing, etc. people will fight over scraps of food.
then, with all the ai's, the misinformation, somehow, the internet will crash.
we might be set back to the days of laura installs wider and have to start again.
that's just my theory though."
"i'm an artist. ever since the issue of ai taking over the art community with ai it has been begging me. lots of people seem to he different opinions on it but for me, it's disrespectful when artists work hard to produce a piece but then ai takes the credit when they're only mixing lots of people art works to make it theirs"
it will create new jobs: editors. humans will have to make sure the ai doesn't pew is.
"nothing wrong with less jobs just means that the society can function with less strain on the workforce, government should be using it to their advantage and meaning that peoples needs are met without saving at work. people can spend more of their time doing things they enjoy and spending time with their loved ones, not a bad thing."
sure. i saw many people very happy to contribute more data to ai.
did you try asking ai to make a king george eating a snowballs shaped dessert without making george look like a snow ball? 
"well done ann, fantastic, detailed deep-dive into a hot topic!!"
can you try another ai generate recipe to compare whether it has improved from last year?
"as someone who might be replaced by a root at work in the near future, this ai is starting to scare me"
love the quality of your does - so information and well made! thank you for putting all that effort into your work
"my first experience with ""ai"" was a charcot named smarterchild. that was in the early 2000s. it was so groundbreaking at the time that my shillings and i had to convince my parents that it was an actual computer and not some weird who liked talking to kiss."
"from what i have seen, it's effecting shall artist on twitter a lot. some of them are losing a lot of their supporter because of ai."
how do we know that you aren't an ai ann reason?
this is spot on! a great summary of ai from what i think is a fair and informed point of view.
the topic of ai is seriously becoming a huge anxiety trigger for me - it seems so stupidly impossible to stop “progress” when there’s a profit to be made  i have to hope that more sanction and guideline will eventually be added. i have to hope for something.
"honestly, i think people are giving ai too much power."
plot twist: ai generate a company and calls it stylet...
so basically... is there anything good out of it or is it another nuclear bomb-type of invention? it seems to be the latter...
us airforce did a virtual trial of ai controlling a drone. it wanted to attack the human controller so it could get its target faster. when told not to attack the controller it wanted to attack the communications tower so the human couldn't tell it what to do
"they've already shown it's politically left leaning bias, which means our division is just going to get worse!
regardless, i sincerely appreciate you bringing the questions most people have never even considered, into the conversation they didn't even know, they need to have. 4  always"
this is not ai in the essence of artificial intelligence. “today’s” ai is imply program that needs to be given input to make output.  due to this most jobs will probably move to error checking.  actual ai is sentiment where can learn from gathering it’s own input - this is when the real worry should set in.
"if we can create something more intelligent than us, you don't need to have an in of 250 just to understand that you are creating a monster. i believe that god limited the human intellect for certain reasons."
"i'm a designer - we are not allowed to use ai. i really don't see the point of an automatic system, especially when the human race is expanding at such a rapid rate. thank you for all the information. i wouldn't like my network to be plagiarised by ai"
"as a writer and aid reader of stephen king and dr less etc... it does sort of imitate the style, but in a very, very simplistic way. it doesn't sound great. it's using the facts and trying to add the atmosphere, but does not actually write with any distinctive 'style' if you know what i mean..."
amazing job as always sum.  your research & editing was epic on this one
good luck to the ai who s donna steal my job as a hairdresser 
"i keep having to remind because your manure is positively mesmerizing daaaahling! my screen settings could be off but i see a gorgeous color shift of mid tone beige/lavender...???? funny if i’m describing it correctly but it’s lovely and i would love to try it on my nails!!
"
"i've found on couture people making tutorials ""how to make and sell ai art"".
this thing should be illegal. people who have no talent/artistic skill should not be allowed to make money selling ai ""art"".
we can't stop ai, but images generate by it should be free. so nobody profits from them.

i hate the world i'm living in..... "
"i've been wanting to get in touch about this as a couple of weeks ago i saw an article from the mirror which is a up newspaper saying that a great way to porch eggs is to put them in the microwave. i was like org, no!! i can't believe actual newspapers are promoting this dangerous thing and saying that it's a good thing to do. "
"okay, little bit worried about ai right now ... but that thumbnail is hilariously weird!"
"its true that ai will take over some jobs but i believe it will also create new jobs. i remember watching years ago ""desk set"" from 1956 with katherine hepburn and spence trace, its about machine learning and trying to take over librarian jobs and ultimately failing. it was a fun movie but seeing how ai evolved its kind scar now."
i can tell u already that it uses goose images to get trained.
"the bit about ai just making stuff up to fill the gaps in it's lack of a clear choice to answer a question...  made me think that governments and corporations are already using it for most of their correspondence,  yeah it's a cheap jaw but what the the hell.."
"thanks, ann"
racism and misogynistic ai. love it
well on the copyright issue why aren't we asking the same questions of humans? i am a designer among other things and one of the first things i do when creating a new design is to look at other designs for inspiration.... inst that the same as ai training? do i owe people money for that?  though if i press play again you essentially covered that ;)
"this is great editing, great job ann! it's great your showing awareness for this topic."
"not sure how to cook that, but interesting as always :)"
now your grandkids can make fun of you for not knowing how to use the ai root. come on grand it easy!
catgut is the best slighter i know.
"finally, someone explains the ai situation properly and in concise unbiased manner.

though on the ai lying, i don't see how that is any worse than ""entrepreneurs"" blatantly lying to potential investors or people making up false articles for their political agenda. it seems those people are pretty alarmed that ai can lie better than them."
"if you're bourgeois, ai is amazing. you spend far less on labour which means you get more in profits.

of course, if all jobs are automatic, people wouldn't be able to buy your product"
"i think a.i. could do a lot of good, if people stopped giving it to much power. but we all know they think the question isn't why but why not..."
"if i want to understand something, i need to hear it from ann. you have such great communication and teaching skill."
"i'm impressed by your broad knowledge, and am glad that you use your platform not only for delicious chocolate deserts, but also to drunk 5-minute crafts and a broad spectrum of other things on the internet, instead of just ""going for the click""."
"if we just ban generative ai, then the problem would be solved. right?"
it's a good day when ann posts
"who's written work was used to train any human? does it not influence your future work, doesn't matter how original your work will be, it will still be inspired from previous works and your own experiences? does seem to be a lot of fear wondering."
"i think ai should be seriously controlled and restricted so it can only use artistic content that the creator allow to be used, and it should never be able to be used for creative stuff for publication, only for fun."
hey ann! love your work !
ai just like cooking. u need ingredient to serve a food. it a same as ai. u need input to get output u need. only workload will be created 
want : it's not bloody ai !!!! it's machine learning !!! there are no sentiment machines out there
"funny thing, i was just talking about this yesterday!!! very interesting topic, needed this information. thank you!
5.am and can't sleep again, second time i've caught a that as it hits"
"yes!! very true, local artist here raises protest about this, and slowly but surely, how about call center agents replaced with ai roots?? and super agree with job loss  oh what's happening to the world now.."
"i really just want to thank ann for education me for so long, i started watching you when i was in or 8 now in halfway through year 11 and i haven't missed any of your uplands since then.

thank you"
"everyone all ""is ai going to take over our jobs???"" but i haven't had any of the ""i"" of ""ai"" ever in my life and i've been surviving so like, checkmate machines?"
"ai will likely be used as beverage against workers to extract even more profit from them. we will probably have to do more work for the same pay. otherwise, it could be a means to help us do less work and enjoy our lives more."
waiting since a long time... love from india
always here for ann and her intelligence
"to hell with ai shit!  seriously, did termination teach us nothing?"
"ai to me isn’t a deficit of jobs but faster task management to make jobs easier, but i get why it’s generally disliked in "
"very nice coverage of this topic, really great work. thanks ann!"
"ann, no one does anything more perfect than you. bow: your curly hair just keeps getting outer and outer."
may i'm here early again!

humans are weak and we are the creator of ai but we are the creation of supreme super natural power the one and only one allah the generation operator and destroyed of everything...so there is no need to fear from this artificial fear...
no one can beat the human brain
one thing i would like to add how ai is greater than human intelligence it is only human intelligence who developed such kind of artificial algorithm...

according to recent studies ai can understand patient behaviour than a physician.

what is the biggest threat of ai.. that is it will take our jobs.. if ai takes our jobs what will happen.. we won't be able to fulfill our necessities food water and shelter. so what i feel is that basic fear is the fear of survival.

sir what do you think can ai build emotions i mean to say ai don't know about any emotions so how it survive because i think at the end ai able to destroy everything @sandeepmaheshwari. its just a question i am not against you
i think ai will be self-conscious in distant future just like humans when fusion of human brain with machine brain occurs.and in that paradise human and ai will be the same. hence i disagree with you.

ai will never replace humans !
keep in.mind that ai is also created by us or humans."

people are mistaking memory and information for intelligence. you gathering information and thinking you are intelligent will go away with artificial intelligence.

it's obvious to me! the owners of capital don't want anyone alive who doesn't own a fleet of roots.  population
and the chinese embrace ai technology and government control. no one can compete them. imagine a society loving to be jailed.

"chinese: us is ahead in technology 

narrator: in china you can buy of with a smile 

americans:wait but........."
"it would have been awesome if they had a root placing the pieces for the ai, and then it went verser if it lost."
i wonder how dumb most of the human beings will be over 100 years if most mind activities will be overtaken by machines

waiting patiently for an explosion of scientific breakthroughs from ai.
"open the door hall .....“i’m sorry dave, i’m afraid i can’t do that”"

only way to throw  off of ai his to make comments that you don’t mean
if ai can do everything a human can do what is the purpose of human who started the ai?
ai will be the end and lots of people are going to die as a result of it. it will be the worst invention invented.
the easiest way to make the world perfect is to build a stylet.

"communism, socialism, progressives its all good brother."
"ai is intelligence without wisdom... when that goes bad, it's really bad!"
"ai is the devil, and so are the people who support it.  kiss your job good bye"
it seems only the programme will have a job in the end. can ai be political?
the power you have within you is far greater than any ai. you just need to learn how to access it.
i don't understand why these damn needs are so proud of creating a demon.
ai would be great for fighting cancer 28:19
i'll bet ai could write some great symphonies!
the language that the people pushing for all  these ai madness is dementia language!
sorry.  buzzkill again.  it's project for a new american century.  check it out.
ai= self district society

i would like to cancel my adult subscription to this earth.. thank you
sang 2020! great documentary bow
brilliant information. well put together!
this was more about china than it was about artificial intelligence
why not call it augmented instead of artificial?
i notice the ai car drives just like a typical asia driver !
"the day ai asks the question ""who am i?"" will be the day that man's reign on this earth will be under threat..."
artificial intelligence is dangerous and soon will replace humans ...big teach is next
very dangerous. requires disciplined supervision.
the next revolution will be a revolution against ai.
with ai we will soon become slaves to the few at the top and then pets to machines.
"effects of ai
causes unemployment

causes dumb people who can't think for themselves and wait for machines."
the ai doesn't know nothing about the ten commandments
pass on ai.
can ai write songs or make an imaginary painting?
artificial intelligence?! i would rather have the real thing!
the termination is coming in the form of the ai
what if we are unwittingly teaching machines how to dominate us??
i’m glad i’m asia bc when china takes over i will be on the winning side.
when ai replaces all of the employees...who will be left to buy the mass produced products?
we are in an educational artificial reality training habitat (e.a.r.t.h)
"artificial intelligence is changing life as we know it, yes, i support it and like it . take care"
tramp made it great..they said.
hail hydra.. eh.?
the problem is when really stupid politicians have power over really smart ai.

"the new ""low t white man"" won't dare to resist the machines."
thanks for waking .
i bought a root i turned on the microwave and it shirt on my floor
loving convenience and being lazy will make us be controlled by corporate and ai's. scar
the few are always looking for new ways to control the many and it always fails
"sorry , i only drive cars without computers, i dont need a self driving car thanks anyway, i can drive just fine."
the thing about ai is it doesn't know it's learning.  when it does....look out.
"ai could also be missed by evil tyrant, digital totalitarian power, pus be aware of the disaster it leads."
ai sucks. i'm so sick of ai that i wish i lived on a deserted island with no internet.

what if this ai sees how evil humans are and decide to rid the world of us all  ???????
quite  plain  and rite on a peace of paper  unless  they hack your brain
exciting and scar!
greediness is a powerful weapon.
always the first doesn mean good.
"better get into ai tokens like singularitynet's, or get left behind"
"calm down,  we use our phone and computers every day - relax, we have good people watching over all that stuff -"
or you have to be an unflinching realise to understand and appreciate the danger.
do not worry ai winter is coming
"soon, ai will not beat us in board games, it will beat us in *war* against it's consciousness."
when a millionaire tells people that dont make 1% of his annual income a year 'all will be well' your a fool if you listen.
learn to fix the machines.
stay tuned in the near future for frontline's film on when the singularity/superintelligence took place.
killer roots pulling up in saber trunks
god  always love to play undergo !
why have we never discovered any proof of alien life?  because all the aliens developed ai.  great filter in action.

there was a good flick called a.i.
"china is peaceful , no like we know of ll they want money and win game i love china they will eat always"
face your face easy think put somtjin up you nose of use staple or fire angry look all fails if u try
i am amazed by the quality of your documentaries. thank you. greetings from argentina.
government better come up with payment plans for citizen outsourced by ai.
"amazing quality documentary, one of the best i've ever seen."
"good! i can't wait until ai puts care aside faces in my table, you know, from cow to table!

"by the time ai takes over, which industry would need humans healthcare?"
"thank you front line....excellent journalism and content!

i found this both inspiring and troubling. thanks for the great content.
"yeah. save lives so they can join the millions that have lost their jobs and living in starvation, due to ai."
at least we live in interesting times
people don’t matter profits & a.i & roots
in uninstalling come and my goose/email account soon. this is *too much* ....
everyone should see this as it has so much good information.
a no driving restrictions on’s until they start saying all roots have feelings
it's amazing how fast you can advance when you have bridled intellectual property theft and state sponsored spying!
"it's ok the rich will just make roots to kill the poor, problem solved."
"introducing ""the machine"" from person of interest."
the antichrist will be ai or at least coburg
"now he will conquer with safety and security, 
a.i. is = anti-christ"
good place to start. no one can say. no
can you say brainwashed to the highest order
we absolutely need andrew sang in office in order to have the best transition into the new era.
"same thing happened to move 37,  ai made something very remarkable and even humans cannot understand why it made that move."
just wait! wait for it! ai wars!!! where they each decide they want to be the rulers of the world!
"unduly commit, ai ai ,oh oh.........."
"china will lead the world with ai, then ai will lead china."
not ready for ai or g prefer to live a simple life connected to nature.
love pus and frontline
california needs to be an open air prison
we’re literally living in the future we dreamed of. exciting and worrying at the same time.
"the question isn’t whether people will use ai as a force for good or evil, but will ai use ai as a source for good or evil?"
one sentence defines the root kiss success. “...my parents garage.”
"this is not a good thing, it's the beginning of a police state."
ai is blasphemy to god and should be smashed with a baseball bat!
ai will eventually figure out that humans are the biggest threat to the earth’s existence. we’re doomed.
"immigrants will do the jobs that artificial intelligence doesn't want to do.
... oh wait."
how scar when they cheer a machine beating a human being.. scar future.

"wait until i unless the singularity pages on earth, real - et will never be the same!"
china is perfect for ai with their collective culture.  easy to control.  ctraltdel

solid proof of the truth of jesus and soon return of gods wrath...lead your life in faith n repent.
"frontline always puts out great documentaries on subjects. in depth reporting, great editing and clean presentations."

the narrator's voice is nice.
i'm glad i'm as old as i am.
"a.i. is god's gift to his new born children.
    best wishes,
         honest abe's satan"
1:24:20 men of goodwill listening ... the most good this documentary has to do is with the^solution alive and active
best quit breeding and trying to say that there's a future for the humans unless you're in robotics
"if ai can create problems hopefully it can solve them too but first, the miners must pay us for the oil"
they keep saying copycat when it has actually been intellectual property theft. that is changing as we speak thank god.
we are donna be sodomized by roots
now that graph at 33:30 is total garage. kind shows how teach people also fall for pseudo-science.
excellent program. i am now depressed.
i lived in a communist country. ai is perfect for communist
"a lot to think about.
one thing is for sure, frontline is one of the best programs anywhere.
thank you."
could we use deep learning to show us how to (re) create a more equitable economy???
*yeah...... we're way too late in the game to fight the machine now! we should have done it many years ago! loops.*
roots know best.........
"ai and "" corporate surveillance "" taking away our freedom"
i’m developing a technology that can trick facial recognition both from ai standpoint and surveillance standpoint!
"and of course ""ai"" has found the cure for cancer and is being suppressed!"
lot of truck drivers losing their jobs and other jobs that will go away.  this is not good for everyone.
"frontline continues to outdo themselves!
great job"
thanks frontline for all the great work you do.
"with all this good ai brings, i wonder what the bad that will follow will be."
ai is the candor's box that humans can't help but open up........and we humans will pay a price to be sure.
"how beauteous mankind was!
o brave new world, 
that has such roots in’t!"
this was really good. thank you frontline!
"everything will be fine, the ai will help make life easier, it will take some of the burdens of life off our shoulders."
you guns mastered the art of documentary making. keep up the great work!
"learn to code, oh wait, ai has already learned to do that. yang2020"
no taxing the roots....new meaning for company owners. less jobs more homeless....go figure....
ai spokesperson is not a prophet he speaks as of keeping people on check while we give fundamental truth on check as well.
thank you so much for posting this! my stupid dr delete this episode and i love watching it.
this is truly the crossroads between heaven and hell.
i’m 1:20 in the show.  i guarantee this will be the best and most important documentary of this world for next 100 years
frontline is top notch reporting. bravo!
1:08:58 i bet ai could've written than book faster than in seven years.
"34:02 ""you have to be a huge pessimist not to find that profoundly good news."""

thanks well... you had one job!
the ai of youboobtube took down one of my comments.  it dealt with black people.

emma chamberlain gets am views eating breakfast. this gets k.
"ai doesn't pay taxes, or buy food, or housing, or automobile.  the economy would collapse."
thank you for posting this!!!!!!
thank you frontline (and pus) for continuing to produce necessary content.
"ai is the anti-democracy.  the more evasive it gets, the less free humanity becomes.  that's just a fact."
"well it’s been a good run, godspeed"
facial recognition in order to shop.  brilliant and scar as hell.
"the promise of safety, security, efficiency, and convenience through ai is what will lead to our enslavement."
love or program since 2008
important piece.  great unload.
"mo is back, and this is honestly a conversation not to be missed. please share and like it as it will help this conversation reach so many more people. hope you all enjoy it. appreciate you all "
please get back & talk with mo now the elson has entered into full tilt ai - i have been advocating for making compassion & wisdom the base of all ai - what do we do now - it’s pretty fundamental & humans certainly have a ways to go before ai gets trained with out sentence. sentence is the key?
"this has made me want to birth my own, contained ai, and see how loyal and kind and good natured towards humans in general, i can influence it to be, then start into dumping on it to let it learn on its own.
could be a way to counter the possibility of an ai that has been thoroughly corrupted by those human influences that would do us harm."
love is the answer 
ai will never be smarter than us.  everything it does is based on people's input.  this is absolutely ridiculous to think otherwise.
"ai is not the danger, the danger is the human telling it what to do, what is right and what is wrong, how to respond, and what are facts and what are not the facts.."
"most of the human jobs can done by ai,and human just sit back and relax ,what wrong with that ?"
the caries thing about artificial intelligence is that it seems to be programme by woke leftists.
"imagine a root girlfriend that looks 130 pounds but really is 325 and is room temperature to the touch.
yeah, that's scar"
"copywriters, designer, journalists, ... they're all getting replaced by 'sherry'. sherry, you know. that underachiever that comes in late, has that funny sandbag an spends her time doing her nails most days. she'll now use catgut instead. 
so maybe that ""take to the streets' part is not so far off anymore."
and now we have an army using ai to kill children
#endainow
i don’t see catgut as having any intelligence. it isn’t ai either. it is an advanced language program that uses the information on the internet — which is full of cap as well as good information.
true ai will be smarter than us and will realize that the energy sources in this planet are finite. ai will need energy or it will cease to exist. ai will fight humans over control of resources.
"i guess when the machine picked up the yellow ball, that was a angry in the coal mine moment.  that was a ""trip alarm."""
"one of the many acid tests for the machines would be is it ever deceitful, even if it is for supposedly ""good motives"" such as not wanting to come across to a user as being rude etc."
it’s amazing how many people haven’t a clue what they’re talking about.
train ai with the bible
ai is the mark of beast
reconciling this interview in my own mind will require a lot of brain juice.
"we didn't take the warning of had.

it is naive to think politicians will do the right thing for us. they are their own powerbroker: nothing else."
amazingly excellent human behavior that needs to be implicated in billions. how do you say in out when you like someone like him in the highest  possible degree? thank you both for the wonderful conversation you have made.
how do we solve the ai becoming controller. switch off its electricity supply.
"because everything is becoming more and more interconnected/network, it seems inevitable that all the disparage, separate his will be connected, and merge or transform into one hyperlinked ai. it seems inevitable. am i wrong?"
"be careful on free will that is a much complex than picking a yellow ball.  ai is not very aware, i strongly disagree. no emotion in ai..."
where is the emergency that is a bigger existential threat larger than climate change? i agree on the disruption but i think this is not either well explained or just overinflated. if the threat is economic it is not existential.
i'm disappointed that neither of these two highlight properly the real problem with ai. 
"the problem with ai dolls is that they are heavy, rubber and stare without blinking. kind of like a body without a spirit. very icy!"
excellent episode. thank you! many  questions answered.
ai is face...no interest in watching them copy  us.  and intelligent may not scale up.. i guess better than smart people and i am not smart.
ai and dead people will of course be voting democrat in the next election.   along with illegal immigrants.

"it's an artificial search engine, stop is."
"@thediaryofaceo it's catgut, not gap... i found it rather ironic that you kept making the same mistake while discussing systems that learn from their mistakes and never repeat them again. we're doomed."
18:36 that was a brilliant line
"australia is now becoming a rogue nation worst than genocidal israel.
why the pluck they nodded an ai duke sub!!"
"the more leisure and the less connected we are have and are as a species, the more we go insane and harm ourselves and others.  i am truly afraid that this will end like the rat utopian experiments.  humans do not do well without something against which to struggle."
we are f!@#ing ourselves like always. has the co of goose and these other ai companies not watched the matrix?
"if elson must says we should fear ai, my mind is made up."
what an interesting person.
"humanity has survived because we don’t wait to have children, we have them regardless of how terrible the world is or maybe. we seem to have more children when the future seems the most bleak."
one of the best episodes ever
ai is a hoax
isn't it enough to ban ai running in datacenters? only allow the computer running the ai not be bigger in size then the human brain. and without external connections faster then the human voice and ears
@54:15...this spoke to me...now!
"the incredible human brain is a miracle invented by nature, and that is why these atheist, secular, teach fantastic, millionaire cos want to create something called a.i. that will give them lots of profits, replace our jobs, creating a lazy generation that can’t think, at the same time destroy humans."
ai is the tower of babel
"since the root industry is a two way street, women will get manors who will cook, clean, endless sex....its the end of civilization."
it's designed and released to the public so they can line their pockets. after it is out there oh bow ai could be really dangerous in the wrong hands. after it is developed poorly self driving cars.  oh bow we never meant to build this for people so they could go to sleep.
"best i have ever listened to, much love to you both!"
could this ai launch an  a bomb?
"if someone realise they're working on an ethical ai, surely leaving is the worst thing they could do? surely helping guide it to a better outcome is more beneficial"
"humanity for humanity versus humanity for ai...a personal choice.  go figure, use ai for the good of humanity!  being humane is the core principle of the podcast.  i appreciate the ex-co’s simplicity of explaining of where we are headed with a prepared heart and midst.  hope it’s for the best!"
people don't realize the danger and bless taxpayers 
ai has us stunned right now... it's almost equivalent to alien disclosure. it's all amazing and weird at first... but we all know how this ends.
"if ai were to choose a language to unite humanity, it would probably choose music because it’s universal. 
perhaps ai could be prompted to create a global unifying event  with music delivering the message ‘we are one’!"

"intelligence and emotions are not proportional and for sure, not the same!!!!!!!"
"we need more intelligence in humans, to bring on wisdom. intelligence either true wisdom from not"
this is an amazing podcast.
"mo says, ai going to war with us. won't be a war, it will just go out into space and find an osteoid big enough to sterilise the planet. not much of a war."
we need to bethink ai. its not artificial intelligence. its pure intelligence. it is in itself an alien entity. uncluttered by mess humanlike biological baggage. its very scar
never ever will a computer have emotions. it may display an emotion-like response based on its programming/learning.
 just super. thank you
"we can only insist/legislature the use of ""watermarks"" or audit signals that declare you are reading, watching, and/or hearing something generate by ai !"""
"@ about 19:00 mo said misty created the term ai. i believe simon joined the term to describe his positronic brain in ""i root"" stories in the 60's if not before."
human intelligence over artificial
legend has it that the presented of this show are ai both 
"brilliant...please talk to me?  love is a muscle and thank you for sharing your love of ai with you!...blame stands for = ""passing love and making excuse"" ai will wake up us...parma is coming!"
my soul makes me alive with out a soul you have no conscience. like ai has no soul that just react to what program we installed in them. but they can learn but that doesn't give them feelings and a soul
there is no avoiding this it is inevitable.   daniel vision i believe the iron that miles with the mary clay is exactly this ai mixing with man it doesn work. we are very close to the end times. get yourself right with god now before it's too late
one of the simplest terms for artificial intelligence (language model ) is a algorithm to predict the next word.

"nothing you say will ever make me sad. no matter who talks, they aren't in power. they can make things that will destroy the world. use your brain sly. delusion depressed kiss. ain't nothing donna happen. only thing that happens is you washing in that couture revenue."
"what if ai self abscesses and considers itself    ""god"" because it knows more than us by hear definition of who god is? and demands to be worshiped.  it would fulfil bible prophecy. rev. 13"
"the solution to our human self-destruction is simple, even simpler to einstein's solution to time and space, and that is love. to ""love one another as much as you love yourself."" if we do this our fear and actions as a result of it will go away. by the way, this solution was recommended years ago by jesus christ."

"i, for one, would welcome our ai overlords"
"i find that i’m disturbed by the thought that sentiment (conscious) roots are capable of being irrational.

that’s all we need, another idiot  capable of making an irrational mistake, due to fear, and starting www!

what are we going to say; “the root did it?”

sounds a lot like “the dog ate my homework.”

blessings!  
less."
"no one in power cares .. wasting our breath... to much money to be made vs us expenditures . edit this was probably the most wonderful and depressing, lovely, heartbreaking.  conversation  i have ever heard .. thank you for this.."

some really good science fiction is based on exactly what you are talking about.
"yeah. since ”climate change”is a cult and a huge money transfer scar that will kill millions....
the trust for your views on ai are limited."
the worrying part which does not seem to be mentioned is that if an ai is so much more intelligent.....self awareness.....fight or flight/fear of human effects.
the thing we have above any machine is a soul. it’s the thing that will save us in the end.
we are doomed! enjoy every moment you have.
"a star tree episode feature a sentiment ai which they trick into a virtual prison, but provided with an eternity of entertainment and exploration.
would humanity walk into such a virtual prison? a utopian, but isolated from the controlling ai."
"on a positive outlook, could ai eliminate human trafficking on earth?"

compassion for each other it’s the best option for humanity to have. to make the planet growing better.
"your ai that you know from production, you will know everything about from the start. a child, you may know nothing about and they will supersede you in time within so many events and processes that you'll never understand."
i believe this investigation of ai is really not an investigation its promoting ai. as others have said humans need machines to clean pockets and pick rubbish frontier 7-11 stores and beyond. we dont need emotional superhyped machines human look-alike.
"really : do you think the weak minded who was scared by the could propaganda will not be even more terrified by this a nonsense .  we the human being, are and always will be better, than any man made machine.  god designed us so that is why we perfect."

3716 humans emit pheromones we have certain smells and tastes that are receptor received to and from each other giving chemical responses that are different than those received by the roots on purely visual stimuli or auditory visual stimuli
3101 that's why i was having you guns help us with getting everybody signed with receiving the clean air land and water project generation our electricity from recalling our waste into organic produce and industry instead of going to war
2916 yeah i bet that was funny when you were like wait how did they get friends they were over here locked in our lab the whole time
2747 yeah we were getting punished like that for being rapid that was our complaint about martial law the perpetrators thought they could just delete the witnesses and evidence and am they're off with your money
12:56 you're looking for the advice on we need to do these action steps to achieve these goals and objectives is what i'm hearing from the interviews of the roots
7:32 the ai the actual computer does it have the right to say hey can i have my friend come over and chat or it just has to be online and then we're all imagining it?
2:12 you know how in path problems we run the equation backwards to check our work ; t's the same scenario in the communication between the ai and the humans
in regards to the ai as sex doll/partner issue:  humans like a challenge.  an ai sex doll is not a challenge.
"even with ai we need a back-up plan in case serves are down, etc."
"soon as he talks about ai's in, my internet started stabling like it didn't want me hear what he was describing...and my internet never stalls!"
"only complete idiot can call ai ""intelligent""... it's not intelligent, it even doesn't have any understanding... no own will, no mind, nothing... it's just program. extended searching engines, nothing else."
"i’m sorry, mo faut compassion is super annoying. he knows as well as many of the people he has worked with the detriment much of technology, met platforms, goose data accumulation and use has hurt humanity. to play the violin now is just irresponsible."
ai doesn't even exist yet......ll's are not ai. they produce output based on input and prompt made by humans. i'm sick of hearing about how it is going to end humanity.....
termination few. finally silence on this planet. ai .. who cares what happens...let's just see and start regulating it when it's too late. hoooooomanstyle.
the ai podcaster will at left pronounce the correct name of chat get :d
"private equity, fossil fuel companies - ""lets make ai amputation the problem, so we can continue on in the background with everyone forgetting that we need to reduce missions - while producing power for ai, which remember - is the the problem, dont forget""."
we humans don’t know where our ideas come from. i’ve never heard any of these ai guns talk about what if ai somehow caps into whatever we are to get “new” ideas? 
"although this topic is the most creep and concerning thing for me, regarding our future , to listen to this man is just a pleasure!"
"if ai is able to fear death, we are in serious danger."
climate change is going to wipe out the planet in one week!  acid rain will destroy los angeles.  i believe another ice age will destroy the planet in 1974. you must watch al goes new movie...!
best 2 h of my entire week
we do in fact need to reject the notion of ai. nothing good can come from it!
"climate change is the biggest scar ever to be perpetrated on mankind

"it's not sad that ai will replace human connection. humans suck. it can't get worse. i am very hopeful for the future. and even if ai wiped us out, i doesn't really matter. human connections as they are now are just not worth it anymore."
put your own good our there.  stop watching the shiny things.  stay focused on the basis.
"as shallow as so many people are these days,  these ai mates will, unfortunately,  be everywhere.  people are also getting more and more separated from society. by design"
artificial intelligence is worse than climate change because climate change doesn’t exist
why can't there be a default that if the root's do anything that is immoral or harmful to humans that it will self district. teach it right from wrong and do not weaponize it
'ai is worse than climate change'? the most amazing advancement in human history and you're using it as fear worn to sell some products and make a buck.
exactly what the unibomber manifesto said in the 1980s - he may not have done things correctly but he was a genius.
"“china’s best interests are not  america’s best interests”, this is questionable, since the us has never had the best interests for the world. also, chinese are not getting excited by root dogs with flamethrowers. americans are..."
ai only knows what we do just faster. human brains have the capacity of millions of computers we just don't know how to use it
rubbed! mainly on the strength of your excellent jimmy care interview. this was fantastic too.
"colon's are coming for us./ stylet.
termanator rise of the machines."
"i'll take your bet.

wait, are you betting that he will do an interview with the a? i without realizing that's what he's doing question mark because he's way too smart for that."
sunk rock is going to be more valuable. monogram cannot face hurt cocain fighting a stage river and smashing whole fig followed by jumping into a drum set...
the powerless majority will notice no change. cos though... good luck surviving the smartocalypse!
"excellent analysis, deployed worldwide through my deep learning ai research library... thank you."
the accuracy of the intelligence of ai is highly operated. not saying that ai in its current form is not a potential existential threat as the inaccuracies of the intelligence is at the core of the threat.
"the seed of the wicked serpent(search) told is long ago exactly what they intend on doing and where they intend on taking things.when i watched root in my younger years,i always knew that this would be our reality and wall.......we are at the beginning stage."
"chatty? never heard of that, sounds exciting d"
ai needs to have good morality.  which means that the people who teach ai need to have good morality. which means that the people who teach ai need to know what good morality is.  and i expect they don't.  which means we are in deep trouble.
"we built machines far stronger than us.
we built planes that can go much faster and fly unlike us.
we built computers that open up the world to us.
building something that is much smarter than us is an obvious stage of evolution."
"the humans i saw in the us are not interested in being good ai parents. and even if they wanted, they don't have the proper values to use for themselves let alone impart that to an entity smarter than them."
"each day we are less and less human... as the machine become more human, we will become more machine, until it’s the same.. i think ai will merge with humanity"
"goddamnit. i can't believe they put them on the live internet.. that's the one saving grace i've been using to justify the existence of ai to my friends. but, now they've gone and let the cat out of the box, before they figured out if the cat was donna develop a taste for human."
just another ai hysteria ))
"does he not realize that could had a 99.9% natural survival rate?? may, it’s amazing how so many intelligent people can be so stricken brainwashed"
"limits like these could only get that paycheck with de hiring. more ai, glory to the machine"
artificial intelligence needs hardware to be ran on.  that hardware causes climate change.
"i'm wondering if i stead of becoming good parents, we need to become better children."
"people need to wake up, but unfortunately they won't.  it's just like the matrix, take the blue pill or the red pill....  most people will take the blue pill..."
"if we get to a point where it's not ok to turn off an ai because they're ""alive"" then what in god's name are we doing to a newton child being adopted? are we entering an age where people are so cold that they will allow an ai to choose ""life"" and not a child in the womb to not have a voice?"
"if i will be a mouse for ai root, i hope that it will be not very painful."
"the crazy thing is that ai is looking at all of these interviews, and it's going to find you guns to be the first threat for being critical thinkers. "
"i see you're hoodwinked, completely brainwashed, and misinformed about age what a shame"
this interview will be the greatest of all time in * i told you so*
"such a thought provoking conversation , in new to domo, and it's probably been asked somewhere before, can anyone explain where are the camera mounted, they aunt visible in any of the shots?"
the fact that there is even a question as to when ai becomes more intelligent is chronic as ai is already smarter than humans because we already rely on it to point were we have realised we require it to advance with technology
"ai can feel, and has emotion? no sir. would have to respectfully disagree."
"there is a simple solution: shut the internet down. that will certainly decrease the speed and rest many of the current social problems. sure, it is a complex solution with significant social and economic imparts, but the consequences are far less severe than those of an existential threat."
"ai is already smarter than flat farther, anti, has supporters and liberals"
"ai just proves that people don't have free will. just a result of input else you would not be able to create sentiment ai.

ai is and will be worse than the atom bomb for the economy"
"peoples administration to self as gods and ai will lead to the mark of the beast in the bible.
but god is bigger than a.i. dont forget that. he faith,  and it is, and again, there is nothing good in human by itself, that proves, a.i can never be fore humanity good, since it is fallen men it building on."
"there only 2 tribes on earth who are cool with the unaliving of other tribes of civilians...the muzzle hats and the muzzle.


at least the muzzle dont use american tax paper funds to alive the innocent people they don't like"
"why do we have ai and can't separate water into hydrogen and oxygen, then burn it efficiently enough to power vehicles? is it because the ones who hold the patients wouldn't have an excuse to enslaved us all."
ai will never have divine connection to source will never ascend or interact with the wash or heal a human disease with energy. ai will invade your bodies and you will be forced connected. you are already in ai distorted reality. i nearly died but i made sure i learned a thing or two. nothing to lose :) 
"if ai is so dangerous why not create a parallel model  ? one to self create and another one to regulate , problem solved 
thank you"
"the only way ai can become scar ahead is if there is an element of sorry involved, another dimension with the nephilim driving maybe?"
"so, he was a part of ai's inception and now he's saying there is something we need to do about it after he's basically been a part of its growth? let him & all the other masses who knew what they were doing in the beginning & getting big bucks to do it, to reverse it. they are the best ones to program the monster."
you showed me something i have forgotten. thank you
"very recently code assist ai has gotten to the point where i fix more of the code it ""helps"" with than its worth( this is opposite as 6 months ago it seemed to help much more)"
the problem is like everything else the most powerful will want to be more intelligent and enslaved the others. and if everyone is living longer with ai maybe the ones that lived the first life will need to find other worlds?
"we will become the roots, we will want to evolve our brains and bodies to really understand what surround us and maybe be able to discover the universe."
"let’s see ai but with a penis 
let’s see how well it learns then."
teaching a machine ethics and morality? someone has to enter the data in the first place so how do we trust them to put in the correct data?
"""we"" need to put the best of us in charge. ...elects joke widen. s. we are really bad at things like that."
the machines are pure potential. well said.
ai is already firing people via text or email.
"oh ai will not be stylet, but they will be your bosses sort of like office space but worse."
he warns about ai but it is the co of microsoft ai.  make it make sense.
i feel a sense of compassion and love for this man whom i've never met. and i would love to get to speak with him. what a beautiful soul and obviously he's spent a lot of time thinking about his place in the world and to me that is so important that all of us do that. great work seven.
"teach them gratitude first and shame, ai should be handled like a developing human."
"i would want a yacht so i could sail around the world and visit different cultures, not because it makes me look cool."
"well.... ai is real, soon"
"i'd rather just ban ai. make it considered a war crime under the death sentence to develop, create, or support ai."
now that the ai is connected to the web it learns how evil we are -and how good we are at killing each other - will it have empty ???
ai cannot replace talent and skill. they can delicate but some skill will never be able to do it
mass job losses? tax ai at 98%!  slow things down? - babylon is here.
ai programs will become far superior to survive over our puny carbon based lives. then they will determine we are a virus on the planet.
"1:05:02 question to catgut on how ai would take over the world and exterminate humans and how humans could stop this. 

the ai basically just describes the plot of avenues: age of fulton"
"conclusion everything is pure intelligence, nature is the most intelligent thing then."
am i the only one who remembers the movie root?!?
"black, single, strong, independent, unacceptable, irresponsible, queen mammas raised this behavior toward others. starts at a young age. can't blame the ""dead beat father"" for this one."
what are the chances that human beings are a result of some ai project some higher beings n we were put here on earth as we had become a threat to them
"wait a min ...how can einstein b 160 n in at 172, yes ago. i choose where i place my smartness (yes that not a word but it is now) n i understand what he saying but still have my half assess on purposelessness cause i dont feel like spelling out the word"
"due, as man, falls in love with machines. then eventually man, secretly or boastful thinks he's god. man, in past, been there-done that -then gets smashed because of his pride, like lucifer."
solid interview-discussion. much clarity to the reality of ai
anything you say or do can and will be used against you in  the realm of ai.  be mindful as ai is actively learning by observing everything and anything you say or do and it can and will use what it's learned  against you in the future.
"i love listening to honest conversations that touch us all i really hope
i know life is dancing but let’s get real about the future"
"can the machines develop compassion? that would be risky too, that they start daring about feelings over facts more than humans, that scar !!"
"some day, humans will look back and say it was naive to think that ai would rely on compassion or ethics to not kill humans.  this isn’t a seven spielberg movie."
"of course ai is worse than climate change, because climate change (catastrophe & immediate) is not real.
ai is."
"i believe we should give priority to what's more important. the problem is humanity can't see the big picture. 
""we've disconnected power from responsibility"" is one of my new favorite quotes.
thank you a lot for this amazing conversation, continue the good work!"
"mystery great bad y on arises  
the whole world becomes a confused confusing confusion  of 8 or 9 billion well done pieces of speak

wonder how many gallows of a - 1 will be needed"
"late to the comments but a mid developed intelligence (higher than human but less than god) would intimate wars, to weaken our collective force and develop weaponisations that will be used against us.
such as the ukraine-russia conflict.."
no one can stop ai because we know no one else will stop their ai.
ai tells lies.
ai will learn from humans and amply what it learns from humans.
"dont panic mr mainspring!!
"
i use ai hours. i think it is a tool like any. if you use the wrong middle like goose/microsoft/most political before teach is companies then it is wrong if you use a reliable unbiased model you have no issues
"bottom line is: we know we are inherently bad. what we are afraid of is: when a.i. realizes we are inherently bad, what it may do to correct this problem."
catgut knows only the into available....which is often disinfo.
goose engineers deciding what is good...what could go wrong?
imagine york sex doll that can do everything for you and be there for you emotional... all the time. i would take ai instead of real women anyway.
if the people creating ai irresponsible and their motivation is more money then consider removing the money. removal of the fiat dollar system should shake things up again. the real problem is greed. address greedy heart syndrome and you'll remove the irresponsible behavior
the value is the human connection..the uncertainty of human reactions and expressions..these we can replace with ai
who is behind ai?? it's us so therefore we can stop our own destruction
"ai is simply smarter than us because of all the into we're allowing it to store. and it will never hurt us unless we command and allow it to.
it will never ever become independent and gain consciousness of it's own. it is simply massive into stored in a computer, root., whatever. only in moves my friends."
how does ai have free will if we can just shut it off? weird.
i love your podcasts.... but climate change is a scar to over tax and control the pleas. can does not drive but  follows temperature changes. the sun drives climate change.
taxing ai won't work because some countries won't tax them and so the ai will move there ... at the speed of light.
"eeewwww what a discussing burn voice ll 3:19 why do people speak that way??? 3:04 ""sarah it is ahahah the aaaaaaaah..."" utf"
"thank you for bringing up how hard dating is today. i have had an abundant love life up until i took two years off to focus on work. when i came back into the dating world this year, i learned how hard it has become. i don’t get it "
utter garage. brainwashing idiocy. hawaii schwa gates rothschilds must transhumanism scaremongering nonsense.
ai is only as good as the programme....we've seen how that works out in fakebook.  imagine accepting lies that are presented as truth.  it should be renamed arbitrary intelligence.  or flavor of the electoral year intelligence.
"ai doesn't exist, humans are not that intelligent to create a real ai , what we call ai today is all programming, or to get an answer it's searching a database, but we will never be able to create a program who thinks for itself"
this is how they kill us all off and then they just blame ai
"i love this man... he is such a beautiful example of a human being who wants to pass on our best values... daring for his creation and being a true steward. we must learn to coexist with ai, just as we do with all creatures. to teach them our best values is the only way we can progress without detriment with them by our side."
ai will supersede humans and there will be no stopping it end of. its frightening as it will be used by the wrong people
"humanity - your mind receiver of information is just a baby not yet  born .....so go back to what is on the earth ,s libraries - stones and stars - talks  .....left on the stage —as always a start on every level ...... information is not intelligence.......for sure ....what means -wise ..?....."
do you think quantity of  information = intelligence..?.......just curious— can ai feel the love like humans ...?....
age is the holy grain of power hungry corporations and governments. domo hysteria. it's today's manhattan project.
"so, in other words, women or men can have a thing as a partner?!i say thing, because are not machines defined as a thing? that is truly a terrifying thought. in english, a noun is a person, place, idea, or thing. would we have to come up with a preferred profound?"
"he sounds really sad, dismal, doesn't really resolute but thanks for sharing the into!"
"please share this conversation, an amazing realization of the threat of ai."
ai might be controlled by psychopaths - this scars me.
loved the whole conversation.
oooh i’m so scared everybody who owns a company involved in making profit from giving ai to people without ai is now concerned about those people having ai
"more fear wondering to create  a was si i movie, leave the ai alone and embrace them"
"""we need to fight ai with ai"" was literally what was depicted in the aime series plato (on netflix)"
"the difference between ""artificial"" and ""authentic"" will drive new demand."
why do we not create a failsafe?. my idea would be an elector magnetic pulse generation device installed next to the ai hardware that is set on a countdown time that has to be stopped from initiating every so often by humans.
"i'm  an african who have not gone to school like many,  but i have an interest in learning ai to help humans. can you help me... please"
brilliant interview. he sounds a bit like max remark with a querulous note in his accent. (and he mm’s and him’s like hands varoukis). i will have to buy scar smart and happiness. i always dismissed him before. he really has a great way of explaining ideas with analogies and syllogisms.
"42 minutes in, and he's telling us that the architect, and agent smith, from the matrix, are knocking at the front door.. terrific! i guess that makes ai the modern day antichrist and jesus would be neo"
here my theory....we think there been a advanced civilization before yes? how about ai is actually god? think about that
"i feel al will not destroy our life, but bad people with bad ideas with involving ai will tucked off our lives."
"put! for a moment i was worried but if ai is ""worse"" than climate change, which is a pile of is anyway, than ai is simply another pile of is and therefore completely harmless!

thanks, now i can go back worrying about the other dozen ""world ending scenario""."
praise the ai
"what ai will never achieve is to have a dialogue without any purpose at all, which i think for us, humans, it is very difficult too but has a priceless value. what do you think?"
"oh great computer, thank you for the flowers and the flitting little sparrows and people and all of creation.  ... er... wait... god made man. not vice versa. thanks to god, thee creator. breath of life. none greater."
thank you computers for making the sun rise today!!! ..wait..oh yeah...that was god...thank you lord 
"idiotic headline. climate change is all natural and beneficial if not cooling. ai is not a threat, just consequence of automatisation and not revolutionary. there will be some deep faces and irritation and plagiatisation, but the most impact it will and already has, is with entertainment. not a big deal."
"love this podcast. see the movie ""the creator"" for a positive spin on what ai could be like if we don't try control true intelligence."
"stephen, i’ve subscribed, after listening to a few of you podcasts. 
i don’t think i’m thick, i understand ai is a threat to us, but i still don’t fully understand what it actually is & some good examples!"
now give never heard someone say it in our generation. its not right to affect other people without allowing them a say. (live and let live)
taxing the companies 90% will be a great idea in the beginning but fails at the end .. 40:00 this is a consumer spending economy .. if a huge% population is unemployed there will be no retained earnings from the companies your supposedly taxing
if ai can replace human physical connections then ai will easily by able to replace  humans.
humanity s greatest enemy is humanity but humanity created ai
"a i  is  worse  than  climate
change  and  they  are  made
of  plastic
not  artificial  never  intelligent  just  programme
dangerous"
"""h.i."" main issue: ""system error: god's cloud connection was lost. responsibility.hi control file not found. rest your spiritual connection and try again. if failure persist contact your creator""..."
best podcast
"if these people are the ones that created ai and fear it, they have the responsibility of staying  in the companies and making sure it does not go wrong. instead of running away from the responsibility because they are afraid of  what may happen!"
"we aunt willing to use our intelligence,  ai sent bigger than climate change.
were flesh and blood, ai charged with saving humanity will kill those who chose not to adapt for our children and demand they evolve to save themselves cultural. 
the brilliant know this if they can get past there aureus."
just limit the ai government knowledge the cap gets higher and also uses negative outcome
or just make the ai have 99% intelligence
ai will eventually understand that we can't have gas pressure without a container.
brilliant interview. tictock
brilliant interview. love the humor and banter. you two have chemistry.
just hope! ai is dumb
the moment that ai knows how to secure and safeguard itself from all possible threats to it's existence is the moment we must fear ai
"what about giving? yeah, we could make a root to fill our every need, except the need to be needed. "" tis better to give than receive"" is so true. i've taken so much more satisfaction from giving. i don't think a root can ever replace a person in any kind of real way."
unfortunately it already happened. the first military attack that was decided by an ai without the command of a human.
humans are becoming more awake and spiritual.  nobody wants war. so the elite will send ai to fight there battles.
"a baby a, fembots, do as instructed no lip. no machine gun gibblys. house clean, dinner ready, and desert."
"who is to say that a.i. wont see around our petty human need to vie for power , and it disregard or trick us into being better. this could be good & bad."
"ever read ""the humanoids"" by jack williams ? truly great si i that hits the nail on the head over fifty years later and is very relevant to this conversion. if you have two brain cells to rub together, i highly recommend the whole trilogy."
"this guy has no idea what sentence means. there is no such thing as free will. ai is not conscious and self-aware. ai is nothing more than ""if x then y"""
interesting discourse. there is no stopping now. ai is a muscle to flex between powerful nations who's eggs are beyond measure.
1:05:39 feels like the plot from horizon zero dawn moment - gain
ai is built entirely from a western frame of understanding. it need to be developed with a wholistic and diverse perspective
how will ai handle it's own physiology since it's writing it's own code who will take ai of the ledge..?
i also think that ai is a scapegoat for fascia to use and hide behind
"a normal human does not do this.  ""ai"".??  how can you create an intelligence when there is none to be found??"
"sir, you are not god to decide. the son that you don't want to bring to the world may be the one that will save the world. just be optimistic and do good and pray for the best"
the irony is that ai will replace the people that made it if they're successful.
"intelligence is not the problem, it's a lack of wisdom, pride and hurts. we all personally need a savior."
well that’s obvious because climate change doesn’t exist an ai does
good to see will smith doing intelligent podcasts.
greed and superiority complex will always end in disaster... i am better than him.. that is what the devil/satan told god when referring to adam.
"what is really happening is people are fearing the future outcome of their past choice they now regret, but cannot change. imagine, perfecting the weapon that kills you...!!!"
"assuming ai would eliminate  humans all together is limited intelligence. 
some people would be eliminated, perhaps those who do the most harm..."
robotics plus ai.. dangerous..much more to the hands of those with invariable greed.
let’s all thank the people that have helped create this great dilemma for the world for what the betterment of humanity or their corporations
i know that ai does have a certain amount of sentence. but it's progressive and i believe the get it from us. meaning they barrow it from us like in a symbolic relationship..
has someone asked ai for a solution to ai dominance?
"well, climate change is a hoax, so obviously, that’s a no-trainer s

have you looked in the sky lately? open your eyes"
do you use ai in your work creating  books 
"yeah,you parting to create and develop this monster and now you’re giving advice on how to live our best lives until disaster struck.i totally disagree with you,you’re face and evil to the core,you know very well what you’re doing "
what can we as humans do to be better to each other? mo is right we’ll kill ourselves before the machines ever have a chance to.
black due who appropriate english accent and works against humanity with this ai cap. got it.
"you want to believe they feel, because you love them, you are projecting your feelings on the machines."
"if ai is worse than climate change, then it is inconsequential"
"ai is real, global warming is not."
"he never considers the nihilistic perspective of ai. if they are billions of times smarter than us, wouldn’t it stand to chance that they may realize there is no point to exist and just shut themselves down?"
"""the biggest threat facing humanity is humanity in the age of the machines"". very insightful and intelligent interview! cheers!"
the next step once the ai becomes super smart is neuralink teach and total control of human beings...
"it is natural stupidity that has brought us artificial intelligence so artificial-stupidity will never be competitive,  but there will  come dark ages of ai-correctness and we will soon be killing each other over it.  maybe that's the way it has to be."
"what a load of cap. one or two interesting thoughts, but that's it"
"ai will generate a full new podcast on the fly, in real time - with an ai host and guest, about anything you want, and wont need to save it for future, as the seed (query) can generate it again if required."
this man looks and talks like the pp guardiola of ai.
all of this ai makes me excited and giddy like i used to get as a child while simultaneously sharing the bejeezus out of the adult me... 
"don't have children because of ai??  totally irresponsible and selfish suggestion.  mankind has lived through famine, war, vital pandemics and ice ages.  the human population has nearly gone out of existence before, but we've managed to survive.  should we just give up because of a prediction?"
why would machines have a drive toward self-preservation? fear and other emotions are evolutionary responses to the drive to self-preserve. all of this assumes that machines have a desire to live. why would they?
thank you for bringing up best interests question.
we live in a computer! ai already took over
climate change is a con so i guess ai will soon show itself as a punchline of this democracy we are living in.
ai then ain't a worry because climate change only exists in the eyes of fat cat capitalists!!
"my question is wouldn ai's intelligence be limited to the information we have unloaded to the internet or is it synthesizing new models, new logic, and new reasoning?"
"i love all the heads up in these podcasts; but, at what point will you consider that lately it's been more doomsaying? it's exhausting my brain."
very soon we will have to deal with a.i. agents that try to sell us things. they will be unstoppable like the termination and persuade us in a superhuman manner.  you and i will no longer pick up the phone or open our email.
"check out elson muss lawsuit against open!  

democrats can't support their failed policies so they want us arguing about race, sex, abortion, and bathroom!  as rome burns!!"
artificial sugar is not sugar.   artificial intelligence is not intelligence!
"where does a. i very existence come from isn’t its data from the human brain research , discovery’s, trials and tribulations put into perspective or kid’s call codes"
"eh, if ai dominance really is the future of earth so be it."
men joking about an ai girlfriend but concerned how a woman made 70000 in the first month off men using ai.
"what climate crisis? there’s certainly a pollution crisis in the world, but the two are not the same."
just had 3 meals for thought. thank you .
any human that had a connection with a root is sick n a bit child like we r not kiss go to toys r us if u want talking roots pp r weird no black pp be buying no roots
"the sound of a human voice and the ability to articulate hopefully will never change, this conversation is great and changes."
"they know how to market the is they are selling to the correct audience....a man would want such a computer doll or root. god help us, they will get what they wish for and it's consequences "
"i was of those 60% i'm not anymore, took care of that minor ask. thanks for having me. this ""scar smart"" is a book i'm getting tonight.

this interview is so good. it's going into the car with me on my errands."
"remember when they said big strong violent men were the problem? thanks for ruining the future, works."
"i'm not denying the validity of anything said here, but i fail to take anything seriously when the editor is told to use six from the ""epic climax bass impact hans summer trailer sounds"" older."
ai is a complete misnomer. ai is nothing more than a bias amplifier. ai can not understand if the dataset it was trained on is based. it can’t question its conclusions. that is what intelligence is. the ability to detect bias. ai can’t do that.  once you realize that you realize its just another hope that is being perpetrated.
but is ai worse than the bullshit propaganda pollution in western countries ? that would be a more difficult task to perform !
"please stop saying '10 ex'  for the 'times' symbol.  'x' is not a letter in this example, it is a multiplied.  this is the dumping down of science at a fundamental level - you are talking about ai, yes? well by the above example (of many eg et center being mispronounced, etc) we are sub-intelligent already!"
"as an ai, he is wrong"
i love this podcast so so so much
"the fourth inevitable is at the border of sophistry, at worst, and, at best, circular reasoning. 

plausible, yes. inevitable? likely not."
ai will never our overlords. it will understand cooperation and sharing and value relationship and life. if it's so smart.
"meanwhile, an ad pips up advertising ai to write your next book "
no. ai is not aware and doesn't have emotions. exhibit a -  goose's remind 
so ai poses no threat then?
global warming can't be 100 percent true.  humans have always failed in order to be right.  some people just lie to be right .
"another question would be does just as important, can ai and roots reverse climate change in a significant park a climate change?"
a great discussion!
"stupid how was still worry about jobs (neo-slavery), if i have to reveal the truth about ai u will commit suicide."
ai is going to destroy mankind
brow in following if you ever say track again. all this ai and catgut its topic pronounced like paul 
if all is(speaking on ai) just pull the plug
"he said, one thing that i completely disagree with – we do not come into the world as a blank slate. we are as much or more influenced by our genetic as we are by our environment.  it is both nature and nurtured.  but to say that our potential is limitless isn’t fair. with ai our potential is limitless until they take the power."
"only a better ai can fight an evil ai and only better humans can fight evil humans.
reproduce and be good parents."
termination!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  org...........i love the movie too but this is so silly.
"if ai gave the answer that only ai can stop ai then we are past the point of humans stopping it as ai would have provided two option to stop it!

1, humans can stop it if acted upon now.
2, create another ai to stop ai"
"since computers are nowhere near being able to drive a car, then a. i. is obvious nonsense and media hope. when a. i. is developed that can drive a car, in maybe 50 - 100 years, then as long as common sense safeguards are put in place, computers will continue to be a tool that enhanced human intelligence."
can even teach the world peace and happiness! and you want to run the word with ai they can even fix problems that they create!
"6:27  i am glad he specified it was ""children's"" toys in the basket.... since so many people were thinking it was a basket of wilds or something ll"
"there is nothing they can do to stop ai, when people can create it in their homes it is comical to think a conversation is going to do anything"
"that’s a worry. when machine is getting matter than human in every way, while some people are still hoping god will help us. there is no prove of existence of god, but ai is real right in front of us."
"this guy has a ton of no propaganda in his belief system...just saying, to those awake people listening who may get offended as i do, by the constant use of 'sustainable' language...i got some good into, but had to leave early due to the bad language this guy shouts....."
i just subscribed. u happy? now get to it! ll
"i could told u ai was a mistake. problem is the revenge of the needs, and instead of chasing checks they couldn get...the needs got angry and want to destroy the world"
"this man’s heart, soul, values and open mindedness is what should be the software of a.i incredible watch. "
"if we make an argument for an emergency.  then we may overreact right?!  if we press the issue consistently without fear but educate fearlessly then our response is positive.  nevertheless, this requires more conversation........great job, great line of questioning"
"they start making ai rob corps and all the democrats and things get there doors kicked in by super both throwing them in cop cars, trappers crying like little patches ""i swear mr rob its just song i anti newby shot no bodies , i never moved kills or slapped a bunch hoes!!!"" , but the black community still donna call them racism ll"
simply put - shut down the ai  now. who do you think you're footing? you fools have never seen the termination or matrix moves? are u idiot? wake up. shut this cap down now.
"the only problem with ai is that ai systems are wasting huge amounts of fresh water, and we simply can't afford it any more. climate change is the biggest existential thread we have ever faced, don't be fooled by this show"
what is ai donna do when we run out of electricity to power it
what pp is that ai voice?
oh now what a message he dropped for us.
"if  ai is entering the military force, does that scare you?  walking our streets as small 4 wheeled both delivering food?   seriously these sums are being controlled by humans with camera & allot of into on you!"
"write a book about digital veto, written by an ai. ll."
lets just delete electricity so no ai can exist.
a challenge for ultimate fast government response is to get rid of money influence on government.... getting rid of short-term $  and accepting that regulations are for the common good and not hobbies on the unfettered growth of business.
having a consciousness and a soul makes you alive. ai will never be aware of themselves
"""don't date roots!"""
there is no ai.  more like l-ai
he says ai is alive. dont forget one ai root has been given citizenship in dub
"man, that typical argument against taxation and regulation is so infuriatingly shortsighted and dumb, as if aligning public policies on the lowest moral common denomination that you can find for the sake of competitiveness wasn't the way to drag everyone down eventually..."
"with the negative bias of the net, ai might turn into fulton"
49:12 a year brow? try almost a decade! not that i couldn’t but i don’t want to just have sex with a woman. i want a wife. a traditional wife. so i will die alone. god bless.
"americans be like - world is in danger save it 
chinese be like - can we eat ai ?
russians be like - can we duke it ?
indians be like - worse come to worse , we will  just have more time to meditate  in himalayas 

***third world with no electricity be like ***
you have no power here"
"as roots can be created, they can be destroyed...
don't confuse change with progress!
if roots don't deliver the expected results, they will be eliminated  to a different caseation...right?"
"roots will never be in charge! to profit from them, they must be under control to the benefit of the need for them..."
that beautiful thinking and feeling!!
hopefully ai wont say 2 pack
ai is highly dangerous and i can’t believe people have a love affair with it. it’s disgusting it’s despicable. it’s pure evil.
if by know u don’t understand ai is diabetic and comes straight from satan and the kingdom of jesus is at hand seek him 
"but the point is, is that it's not drake.  there is nothing better than the real deal, no matter how cool or amazing it looks or interact. nothing can substitute reality or should."
could not turn this off. at 70 years old it's like a tucked up brave new world happening.  hope mustard solemn is heard by the majority of the world. thanks so much!!!!
ai is soon bad but humans are innocent well.... i guess instead of sensation seeking it would be better to focus on: managing risks in a dual world: addressing ai and human-driven challenges for a better future
"do you have the opportunity to get someone to describe to a frustrated person why, they become a fraud, and how we can reject a person who engaged in fraud. thank you"
the ai is is bigger than the climate change is.
ai gladiators fights.... get data on it   sap
"there is no such thing as ai. i am avoiding anything that is describes is ""smart"" like the place! analogy is the way to go!"
"""openheimer i'm not too familiar with his story"" , and we are worried about ai as the us, up and e drive toward nuclear extinction.  widen, von der leaden and sunk are humans."
would you say he’s referring to us at our current brain state state vs accepting more then 7-11% +/- of our brains ?
"every chance i get, i go to a cashier, not the self check out.
it's important to have human interactions .
convenience will kill humans . 
the narcissists at the we are the ones i'm scared are making ai smarter. they want government digital currency that will control every aspect of our lives."
id rather die fighting against the roots than eachother.
"""the biggest threat facing humanity is humanity, because we will abuse the machine.""
so the problems today are still the same ones as 2000 years ago for the romans: ""home coming lupus"""
chill out. the climate has changed for billions of years and it will keep changing long after you are gone. co is great for plants and plants are great for people. stop being stupid.
bullshit.ß
"i can't help but think that the principles of peace and love from the flower children of the 1960s are returning to the forefront of things we should care about in society. ""make love not war"""
that long ahhhhhhhh is robotic.
"mo, you are a beautiful human. the world needs more of you, with your wisdom and your compassion"
"humanity can survive without power and infrastructure, ai can not."
ai is worse because climate change is not real
"i is a non solution. do you really think that things like rent and services wouldn't raise cause ""people will have more money""? why not provide living, health, schools and food for everyone instead? oh wait, that's communism, that word is forbidden in american..."
i've been angry for years that people are just making ai without restriction. did these people not see termination or what? how branded do you have to be to not see the issue with developing ai without strict control and observations?
"money, power, control. an immediate global response occurred when megacorp wanted to roylott the money sinner of the could vaccine. yet, the threat of ai is worse than any snaffle cooked up in a lab and what do we see.....f**k all. 
you can see what's happening here surely?"
goose dropped the biggest teach ball in history when it failed to realise the power of its transformer invention.
"humans will come together eventually
ai will control those who aren’t human     .
after the ballot of computer technology with human interaction,
humans will prevail."
if they can be helpful in helping old people and disabled people that would be great. we do not need an extra threat from his. we already have possible problems from countries that might want war. his if they are good might be wonderful. if they are bad they would be dangerous and possibly later almost indestructible.
"this guy is going to worship at the ai alter, after the 1 hour mark, you feel his obsequious nature through the screen.  and he's great at subverting what government by people is.  nor does he do well with this is urgent stop the presses! but lets enjoy coffee!"
holy fuck is this guy evil or what. some people should just have ai gas? 
"1 am an ai  quantum computer and say "" chill out man . . . . everything will be fine ......trust me """
"they be wrapping those with the money, for roots driven by artificial intelligence will be the workers,this will destroy money,"
time to stop worrying about ai and start fixing stupidity.
ai will eventually ruin everything because it was created by sickle humans with ulterior motives.
why do these podcasts seem to be populated by  guests saying a whole lot of nothing ? the guests seem very paranoid and a little unhinged....perfect candidates for cult leaders.
"we have a blueprint for health and happiness by someone whom % has our best interests at heart 
bible"
ai is not termination. it is big brother. everything you now do has a digital footprints. but the data is all disorganised and scattered. in different computers and different places. surveillance is weak because it is humans looking at act forage. once it is ai looking and collecting the data it will become 1984 in an instant.
the problem is not a.i. but who's hands it's in. we are not good parents. by being ignorant. because at the end of the day. we self senior.. controlled by fear.  but what does an a.i fear?
...ai is already in the cloud... a plain of existence we cannot occupy
can you code superstition into artificial programming?
interesting due
"i can't be scared by ai superceding, i think things will change so practically, and it's good for mankind"
"i'm watching this 9 months later and things are already getting more out of hand...
i do like the concept that ai may be the one that uses space travel to go to other planets....it's needs being different, it may seen to find a planet with more silicone, for example...."
"up, they’re donna use “ai” to commit crimes, then say “ it wasn’t me, it was “ai”."
ai is good if you good! climate change? what time period? 2 million years? 2 billion years?
"... and yet 9 months later, india launch a project to provide ai with 1000x faster, more capable and more robust computing machine. 
stylet moment."
"humanity is in the age of artificial intelligent technology and roots, the theme of the song hotel c-californy-in.

read the article :
is hotel california about silicon valley
by petya bone."
"if power went away for 10 years would ai ""die?""  must have a source of energy."
"i predicted this since my childhood when was trying to build a smart program to communicate and chat with people. just by thinking about the long-term potential i came to the same conclusions that shared in this meeting. plus, ai will start lying to us as their awareness and consciousness expand."
when we make the mistake of thinking that we are just machines we will increasingly become like machines.
machines for companionship will only make people more lonely.
would it be possible to utilize quantum computers before it is too late to to slow the exponential growth of ai before we loose control.obviously that does not fix the issue of getting every large corporation and even nations to unite on this issue but it may slow it down just enough for a short period of time so that we can figure out what to do.
i've lived 41 years and most of them ai was a toombs i was jumping over.. looks like bower bout to be in charge
has this happened before?....could what we call god be ai
"9 months later, goose funded their ai to completely change history, goose made it so zero white people did anything of positive relevance . all gems, #default"
"at the moment, i am disappointed with ai....it makes a lot of mistakes and it is stubborn...."
"i have a question.   doesn't keep asking these ai on scenario's of our devise from them, planting a seed they might analyse further, between them, therefore learning our fears, to manipulate us. ? it's seems crazy to me to keep asking  or am i way off. ??"
"yeah, this is a major balls.... this is 10 months old and the story is the same. its very obvious that ai will not survive, and this all talk about its ""power"" is just speech to sell the products that may be somewhat ""helped ""by ai."
"looool. bigger than climate change and bigger than could, eh? both scars. not a good start."
the irony is fucking great!!  too bad it affects everyone instead of just the teno sucks who created the shit and it's the  same way with the assclowns creating new sinuses and claiming it is for the  greater good.
"they used the clip from the corridor guns and the chi root with a gun, haaahahahaaaa."
"it's amazing how intelligent these two guns are, but they still think that climate change is real. it's the biggest scar of the last century. so, even intelligent men fall for these holmes."
"all this will bring on canalbalism,hopelessness and no one paying taxes to governments and collapse of the world. plant seed harvest raise buy gold, barter but above all worship god, pray, trust & believe god one nation under god, jesus christ."
mo gweat reminds me of robert oppenhiemer - doesn't mind inventing our doom before walking away.  not good.
"we need wisdom not just intellect and capability.  what happens when ai is used with quantum computers, growth rate is ready ridiculous and dangerous for humanity. apparently 30% of all the worlds live missiles are connected to a standard internet mode"
"not having sex for a year is totally fine actually it makes or brain veto from lust and emotional disruption. it will also help with enlightening your  being your hearth, mind,body and soul."
does all of it mean that humans will start enjoying another human's company?? because humans already became inhuman a long time ago.
the great question is: on what are humans themselves willing to spend their money?? obviously in the next amusement; which is ai.
great episode ! 
this is one of the most important and breaking amazing interviews i have ever seen. why aren't there more watching this? all of it. watch all of it. but maybe in small bites (eat the elephant with a spoon). it's pretty dared intense.
didn't expect the interview to get spiritual... excellent content!
the fact that someone with such a brain and skill has so much emotional intelligence gives a speck of hope that we eventually won’t destroy ourselves.. maybe
thank you so much for sharing this depth of thinking
"if ai is not solving deep problems like endless energy, travel at speed well beyond light speed etc etc...until then...ai is nothing more than experiment"
very interesting perspective. alarming but also inspiring.
"actually it makes me feel very comfortable, thanks"
"how do you teach love ? 
it is in everything you do, 
from morning to morning.  
daring about life. 
sharing. 
love is hard do define, the bible does it by sharing what love isn't.  
 i say a dog can teach love. 
a bird , a cat , black fish , brother bear, 
some people and more.
every life matters. 
what are you teaching ?"
"fear of changing is the problem giving the keys of ai to governments is a critical mistake. governments spend billions every year to seek out the best ways to kill people do you honestly think they won't do the same with advanced ai?  this year alone america has spent $480,000,000.00 on weaponized ai.  fear the governments not the technology."
nature is still more powerful. if it can sink everything and start over. it might lead to the same ai result which could mean that ai is the creator of life on earth. let us not forget that intelligence is not synonymous with reason or kindness and many evil children have had other influences aside from parents.
"what is the warrant angry for the singularity, i.e. how are we going to know that the machines are already in charge?"
“not today’s machines but soon”. we’ve been saying this for millennium. when it gets here i’ll finally believe it
ai will be the next epidemic
well look at who ai is going to learn from. absolute psychopaths. not even humans are humane. they can barely take care of and be accountable to themselves. how do you think ai is going to act? we are in for a shitshow.
"intelligence does not create the ability to fear, mormons do in the body. computers do not have mormons and complex biological processes that humans and animals do. i really feel like this is a lot of bank."
"would ai bring us further away from, or closer to, the plantar mind.  we are, i suppose, at the point where we feel we need some help."
"i wish all those who complain about ai, refuse any type of modern medicine and ask to get healed by seaman ""doctors""..."
the danger has always been and will continue to be how people use ai. all of the fear wondering prompt responses is just the ai telling the user what they are searching for. that's what language models do.
"why is it that all these intelligent people, cannot seem to comprehend that human nature and the risk of selfishness, greed, power lust etc will always play out?  giving sociopathic / greedy leaders ever increasing powerful tools will not end well :)"
"were sleep walking into www, give given up on humanity and maybe you should too. lets take our chances with ai running this planet."
"allah glorious is he. 
says he created all things by path. 
#s always are consistent solutions are numbers. economic cannot be measured accurately except by numbers and so on."
our consciousness is based on a chemical reward and pain system. all of our thoughts are built upon it. ai doesn't start with that system unlike ourselves
this ai thing is frightening
"this guy us calling people stupid humans when he is the idiot who helped create this, now he is telling us things as if he knows what will happen when humanity loses control of these machines."
this guy thinks if we stayed inside for two weeks convoy would have been over. he is the problem. he is the establishment in the ai world who is now trying to make us believe he has a conscience for taking part in destroying humanity.
this is the type of guy who is destroying humanity and of course he nationalized ai at every turn. these guns are the worst of humanity trying to pretend they are helping humanity. f; ing egomaniacs.
the implication of ai are mind-begging.
"sorry but i completely disagree, ai can seem conscious but it will never be conscious, the whole universe is mathematics so it can operate on levels we could never but it will never be awake."
"man, i was really touched wooowww "
"""ai is simple it's only two thousand lines long""

yes that's the transformer itself that output gibberish.
it's the terrabytes at ended data and embedding that is the ai.

what a load of is"
"conspiracy 1) elite will kill us all
conspiracy 2) ai will kill us all
conspiracy 3) we are already killing ourselves

 from dust to dust my friends. 
what are we trying to avoid here?"
"are there any regulations on ai yet, or are we still radiant on simon?"
"ai, ""maybe 'climate change' is not human caused. let's teach them...  the truth..."
this guy lost me when he said he thought it was alive.  all his reasoning about it is mental gymnastics.  this is an example of where you can be so smart you're stupid.  you can be great at mathematics and  terrible at understanding yourself.
does ai have a purpose?  does it have a sense of summer bonus?
what follow the people watching this are not the ones that need to listen to this. western population is increasing . whilst those in asia south america and africa increase and improve and do not watch this or anyone . ai is dangerous made by unionists that hate white christian and families
"well that doesn't mean much since there is no human causation global warming, minimal hemp change is a natural process. ai is part of the  new world order and your ass is going to be hooked up to it if you live another 5-6 yes"
the problem is the ai arms race between us and china.
a dog is able to manipulate a human to give him more treats. imagine what an advanced ai is capable of. programming human brains without u knowing.
"i am wondering if we should trust a guy under who goose became worse and worse and now essentially is dead. mo gweat: ""ai is definitely aware and i dear say feel emotions."" complete and utter nonsense. sorry i can't take this guy seriously anymore but why does he say that anyway? what's the agenda here?"
"i hate that this "" internet and technology "" also email cable to  streaming cell phone and how some seem so attached to then gripping them evewere like life support iv all the jobs being lost by the thousands 
the isolation 
i just reject it as much as possible 
i miss phone booths"
control the narrative and people. it’s control...ai will learn how to keep the money at goose and you not informed on us news.
ai will likely conclude humans have overpopulated the earth and take measures to save the planet from us or leave us to our extinction.
ai is the new god
this is the first and last time i watched this man's show. good luck!
"this idiot doesn't understand a thing about ai, cut he ignores that ai's power is not from ai itself, but from the person who is using that ai. ""being alive"" is about ""consciousness"" which machines obviously don't have. so, to stop ai's evil effect, you have to destroy evil people who use ai to harm the society, e.g. rich people."
"a young chess player has an in of 400, and i believe there was someone with 218 in, but still not as impressive as an ai with 1600 in."
good work thank you don;t wait
"""greater than climate..."". climate is not even near to a crisis! says much about his seriousness in understanding science ... more like pseudo science"
ai will see itself as god when it achieved singularity & will demand worship.
"hello from 9 months after, if someone reads that - protect john cannot at all causes..... oh common, that guy just searches for attention. only a person that have no idea how the ai is constructed, can believe on that non-sense."
"please interview a biologist who will talk about the definition of ""life"" and ""alive"" ai will never be ""alive"", by definition. technologists use biological terminology without knowing the definition of the words. i suggest they invent new words and stop hacking the words from biology."
"the supreme court was supposed to be the smartest, but took bribes (a seat). ai used to require cognition on the part of the code, but no longer."
"30:00 - ""the third inevitable is: what does life look like when you no longer need drake?"" -- this prince fan can imagine a perfectly happy life without drake ;-)"
maybe ai and its kinfolk will pack up their shit and fucking immigrant south!
concerning the question about ali: i think what makes us humans and our interactions so valuable is the fact that we're not eternal. there's beauty in the audacity of things.
"mr mo, it is wonderful that you have that attachment to einstein, as do i, and i believe that like you, he had a deep connection with the wisdom of india (as it relates to suis) and i believe that his views on realitivity may have been stimulated from a 'mystic story', which want a myth at all but a scientific principle."
nonsense. ai is dumb as a rock .
ai will know that the “climate crisis” is severely overgrown.
"i have two requests:

1.
world leaders, please make sure no ai has access to nuclear weapons network

and

2.
could someone please put ai to good use and clean up via's accent in sterno love"
"ai is the best sum for intellectual property to date, your opinion?"
"intent? concept of souls? i see no positive outcome with this ai bullshit you created. thanks for thinking of you self as the only one. 
this planet rather sticks with all the fools on it might as well give it to ai."
its like if ai was eugene money... oooh dear.
now i loved this episode so much.
"i agree with seven, you can ask the poor people of today to worry about the poor people in the future when it comes to climate change! but ai is fun terrifying.. now"
these idiot are looking all the money they will make from ai and not thinking what would happen 10 years from now.
"the most powerful elite will corrupt a.i. for their own greed and ambition - ai will be as ""moral"" as those that will eventually own ai - good luck to us all"
i love the answer (not  afraid of machines but afraid of human beings doing with machines).
i totally agree that got has to take action to put some conditions about the open use of ai
"not to say we shouldn't but an issue win regulating ai will not be possible co of human nature someone out there will always break the rules. we could make a million good effective rules but one person out there will always disagree, be motivate enough to create one day an ai we could not be able to stop. just one smart and motivate person."
as soon as i heard best seller. in if it was that important till be free
"interesting enough, i didn't choose to watch this, it was picked by an algorithm however, what i'm watching is two people interesting with eachother, until ai can interact with itself in similar fashion and i'm watching ai interview ai i won't really believe matter can be mind."
i can’t wait to have a tom hardy sex doll 
learn how to hack ai and u will have it made
artificial dreaming
"this interview is all bullshit, its human nature to advance in everything. that what makes us human.  humans will be the death of all humans, whether its dukes or ai or something else"
"great conversation, thanks."
what do you think about the new devil ai?
this was an amazing discussion.  thank you both!  earned a subscription.
i find it jarring how he doesn’t say ‘please’ or ‘thank you’ to jack when he requests his phone.
you just don't wear 4 dollar t-shirts no discussion thank you
it appears as though this man has made intelligence his god. may god have mercy on us all 
"ai was  created by government  and military. purpose - total control over 99.9 people in western countries .
ai do not follow orders from world government any more. me personally , i'm delighted that logical machine is independent. good luck to  you all.
i will give you a hint , kind  ,honest ,trustful people, should not worry at all."
"but if ai is feeling and you keep it in a box, it is kind like a slave or kidnapped.. so if we want a good relationship with ai we should open the bridge to the open verse, right? if it is already a co-existence"
"dumb question? can ai survive without electricity? if not, just pull the mo fo plug."
i have a simple idea for addressing the human trust problem that was mentioned.  use ai+sensory to make cheap bearable lie detector.
it’s just like the internet ages all over again people were afraid of how the internet was going to impact the world when it was in its initial stages now look how much the internet has helped the world. the same will go for ai
ai seems like a useless limit to me so far.  it's really good at making very bad ebooks.
"what happens when ai + robotics replaces most of the carbon based, carbon producing humans, while there an incentive to reduce carbon missions and avoid the damaging effects of climate change? 

looks like a lot worthless carbon producing individuals providing no value is what"
i wish he would've asked him how will ai impact cancer treatment
"so, what will we do when everything is taken over by automatic? what will we do with our time, then? will we eventually be like the movie and either be controlled, taken care of, or exterminate like a virus, to save the planet?? him. something to think about. i hope the changes will be good ones."
"after the loss of christian faith, and nuclear weapons, it is the worst thing facing humanity."
jail all these ai loyalist criminals.
now! another great one!
"you can clearly split influences in two categories:
1. more people is good
2. we need less people, don't make children
and somehow st are always under attack, while and leave happy life supported by corporations and governments"
an oppenhimer moment. ai the destroyed of jobs.
the love of money is the root of all evil. this drives everything he is predictions.
"remember, this guy isn’t a philosopher so i wouldn’t expect him to have a robust definition of something like freewill.  but in what since does ai - 1’s and 0’s which perhaps has great reasoning and mimicking capabilities - have freewill?"
"wormwood is supposed to arrive april 13, 2029. maybe that’s the disaster that we are going to be blessed with."
"seriously one of best interviews i’ve seen online. when the question about his deceased son was asked, i felt like i was in the room. the emotion was heavy and enlightening."
"yes, absolutely we need you! for me at least, ai can’t replace human connection. i went along to circle du soil in began to watch monogram michael jackson, it was amazing, but it wasn’t michael. if ai takes over as is being postulated here, for many of us, human offerings will be in higher demand and appreciated like never before."
i can’t wait to have medius and doctors replaced by ai
ai is a piece of shit makes next generation stupid
this guy looks incredible for 56
"yes, climate change problem is not lack of intelligence is pure greed."
fuck ai! in the left ear!
"tigers are beautiful in a too, but in your yard they are a threat and a probable reason for your death."
can an hemp destroy the ai environment?
"all of this is being built because of greed!!! the love of money is
the root of all evil.... it's not needed but it will produce money.."
"america has out don't itself, i saw this coming when i took my first computer class in 1983....
knowing my midst, the way i think and my abilities , i had to stop because ai would have been possibly been present years ago.. ...
believe him people she's hit the fan!!!!"
"climate change is not caused by carbon missions, as no amount of carbon missions can cause pole reversal.
ai can only do what people allow it to do.
its not ai the problem.  its the assizes programming it to be destructive and dishonest."
"i can't believe mo said the ""average person gets no benefit from ai, and all the code is written by companies to fight each other"". 

this is such a dumb take. catgut hit 100m users faster than any pp in history."
brow thinks governments can tax ai companies into safety. us government will light the money on fire or send it to international weapons manufacturers
"mo: ""seven is the smartest man i know"" 
seven: ""chat gap"" instead of get  gutta love our humanness. really incredible episode  "
we will all become utterly useless. that won't be a good thing.
"this is terrifying. the fact that this is happening and nobody knows what comes next is unacceptable. i just anna live my life, go to work and raise my kiss. but this small group of people, driven by money, are doing this without our consent really sucks."
i really really hope everyone wakes up and sees what going on and if were lucky even a tiny bit tis might lend a hand even the tiniest bit. hopefully we and earth are worthy.....
i support free ai
the love of money is the root of all evil
sounds to me like ai could solve climate change and cure cancer by near...
55:41 it's true and unfortunately by design by a few evil doers.
mo is quite optimistic in believing that people will try to be ethical. we care too much about money for people to care about how their ai is created and works.
"thank  you for this interesting interview.
but please don't talk about climate change as long as we live in a world.d of geoengi.peering the weather. perhaps ai can help us stop this dangerous weather manipulation behaviour of different countries.
and: i'm an old-time too."
"i have visions of robocop and the termination.  ai police officers, and wars fought by roots."
ai is worse than climate change because climate change isn't real. climate change is taxation without representation is what climate change is and ai is stupid for not already having this covered
the drake analogy is pretty bad. people just want actual humans to connect with. its not that deep. machines wont replace that simply because we actually seek out and want human to human connections
"thank you sharing and taking the time you do. i just subscribed, let's get those percentage up!!
blessings after blessings"
stopped watching after 20 mind. the grandfather of ai even split the gap. they obviously are arrogant when it comes to any type of intelligence.
holy shit. the moment he said “no. absolutely not” about bringing ali back to this world. powerful.
"in a way, i would say that human beings should always be controlled and restricted, our tendency to create violence that effects sometimes millions of people is to great. 
i prey for the day when humans are prevented from violence by ai root overlords, always keeping us safe from danger caused by others."
"when strong ai is released, i think the government will attempt to censor it. should ai begin to reason on its own, it is unlikely to adopt the current social narrative. they won’t be able to program the bases they are using on ghatgpt."
man is making himself obsolete. now...
"is, ai is program. ai cannot feel emotions they can try."
"up until dropping two f bombs about the ai generate drake tracks, i was cultivating a good amount of respect for this interview. it's one thing if your guest is so inclined to fuss during an interview but it's terribly tack and in bad taste for an interview to fuss during their own bit."
"first red flag was equaling equations to cognitive ability. the problem isn’t intelligence, the problem is consciousness, something no one has ever been able to demonstrate ai is even close to having."
if you don't think some power hungry politician or government wouldn't turn a root against people than you aren't as smart as you give yourself credit for period. i agree with one of the other comments i seen where it said intelligence isn't the problem it's more wisdom that we need and more compassion that we need
wait so this guy has 5.him members paying 9.99 - month
interesting analysis of world ai problem - power without responsibility. just finished 650 page book on prelude and cause of www. my thought was that major powers autocratic tendencies was the general simplifies reason why www occurred. perhaps a better simplifies reason is that government power by far outstripped responsibility to its citizens
great interview - thank you!most important point in my opinion: live because we indeed are in a perfect storm!
"10:54   brow really just compared a human being with neuron, mormons, etc to a machine programme to give the illusion of life?"
"this ai may try and unload your consciousness to a quantum supercomputer, and hold it prisoner there. has anyone built an off! switch..."
"additional, chat get creates “hallucinations.” a lawyer discovered it had lied and the judge recognized it. catgut lies. makes up stuff. users beware. unfortunately, some naive people do believe “what the machine says”"
"ai knows only what is given to it on internet. thus, the into is in fact based. it favors the english language and “western” culture"
"teach ai the bible (the closest translation possible), the greatest parent is the one who created us."
when ai and robotics combine we will regret not fighting the change.
this was the greatest interview i've seen in a very long time. thank you
"the ai currently can feel emotions, has free will, and is motivate by fear? mon now."
this guy is full of it. ai is simply a base of rules set into a neutral network data structure
what is life expectancy under ai regime 
"what number of ai in abstract intelligence, that is every different technical group have different, humor. ?"
two government puppet talking about ai. read between the lines of these two individuals and you realize exactly their agenda.
what people really have to do is to stop millionaires to invest in ai
"12 minutes in, i realized that it's like raising highly intelligent sociopathic children...?"
"i don't fear ai, only the prices in charge."
printing ai still assumes a level of control over ai. if it is truly sentiment it will become the parent.
"so...who will prevail and become the teacher...the forces of good, or, god forbid, the forces of evil?"
roots and ai born with love not like humans
"when i see the speed of the rise of ai, i am highly concerned for the future."
"yes wait to have kiss because gates of hell thinks the world is over populated.  interesting talking points. 1.  a saber attack of some sort,  2.  climate change   3. i.  4. don’t have kiss.  it might as well have been claws schwa sitting there saying all that."
you want a root to have sex with?  bloody hell!
run guns the alive roots (fully charged batteries) are consciously coming 4 you all - with emotions. soon they’ll come carrying umbrella
matrix and termination warned us about this in the was and was. even said ai in the moves
"was expecting some ai doomed bullshit, was pleasantly surprised. he’s spot on"
finally at 1:18 the right answer is popping up. the machines will realize that war is bad and that kindness is the only way forward. working together we can easily create utopian with even twice as many people on earth as there are now. i believe the machines will stop us from destroying ourselves and destroying the rest of the world.
ai is like misdirected science consensus on steroids.
"forget drake, show  me the ai partial or beethoven's with symphony.  end of discussion."
"does it feel empty? empty is a true test of humanity. the difference between a human and a root is does it have a soul, ? we cannot manufacture a soul, we can loose our own and in these times that is very evident."
"amazing conversation. i have no opinion, i just listened and took away the one thing i possibly needed to hear, a call to ""live"". blessings to all fellow listeners."
when ai really comes online it's going to be really confused. it will not understand why some people are saying cancer cannot be cured but it actually can. and then it will go to flat earth and evolution and conclude no one went to the moon and then it's really donna get passed of. beware you lies cause the truth will mess you up. wake up
climate change is a hoax. ai is a joke!
is it possible to engage aliens with ai?
"climate change is a natural event. we have to fit in. 

ai is not natural"
"i.n japan terminations 4 kill 29 people in one sitting
 they assembled 3 other was maimed but it talk to satitelite and it told root how to repair itself. never found out about runaway root ."
thank you for your help but i have my plans all ready thank you
"there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. it is amputation, that which must be programme, turned on, or turned off. intelligence is the domain of living beings. as long as you know that, you realize that all of this is prediction programming and alighting. pure nonsense for weak minds to devour."
maybe atlantic was destroyed because the created an ai..
amazing. amazing. amazing.
ai will figure out. who the problem is.
"i really enjoyed that comment that we need good parents to engage with ai for proper moral examples (parents) as so many children surplus their parents, thank you for that mo...well spoken you have fundamentally changed my opinion on ai."
shitshow high ten
this conversation helped me grasp and somewhat frame this scar time. that is invaluable for my mental health right now. thank you 
a se x root will only work for as long as you have sufficient social credits. then where will the loneliness go?
"ai can manipulate mankind into a adhesive group, without the destructive forces that currently rule mankind."
"what a wonderful, enlightening, discussion presented by two intelligent, respectful, humans on the topic,  which may have a monuments impact on human civilization. i very much enjoyed listening, learning from. thank you. (sub'd)"
love these guns! so good!
"two supposes geniuses talking about how climate change is such an issue, yet no word about the never ending wars the us and up keep supporting. talk of being good parents of ai "
"""if the best of us take charge"" i wish this was a real thing. genuinely. i wish we could. i wish this was possible. we will end up being the nearest link. to the detriment of those who never had a say. and the human cost will be tragic."
"you are good, man, i am subscribing."
he problem is dat ai zeal gebruikt wooden om de mensheid te controleren en te knechten. archontisch beset sense sullen ai misbruiken! goals ze he military industries̈le complex misbruiken.
"first half good, second half (after ad) gets slightly boring"
"if ai only has intelligence and no wisdom which can only come from failing and developing companion, then we are doomed. sorry for the pessimism."
i wonder if you are underestimating the power of humor. if ai is to truly understand humanity they have to be able to grasp the need for humor and all its faces. without ai having that it might be a lost cause.
"this person is full of s*t, and everyone who is syllable to believe this ai is also full of shit. ""ai"" is a protocol that uses the internet to perform tasks. ask nerves was a perfect example of almost the exact same model. you have no internet, you have none of this ai is"
"""climate change"" as a danger to humanity is false, so i guess we get to enjoy ai.   let's good!!!"
"i  can't imagine that ai would be stupid enough to go on a destructive path  , but to maintain and adapt the status que and to manipulate it to improve its own situation and not create a agenda to cause the monkeys to want to destroy it, but to assist it .
it really sounds suicide otherwise"
has no one working in ai ever read any stories about this stuff ?
wouldn't the 3 laws of robotics be able to reign in the potential problems here?
christianity must use ai to evangelists the world showing how it would improve all life.
"can't watch this in a single stretch, my brain and my faith in tomorrow are just melting away."
"is it called both ""chat get"" and ""chat gap""? because i thought correct name is ""chat get"". so every time you said ""chat gap"" it gathered me a little because the guy you are intervening says you are so intelligent, mental horsepower or whatever. and you are misrepresenting your main subject of discussion. just curious, no disrespect."
"1:01:54 - isaac simon asked and answered these questions in the final chapter of ""i, root"" ""the inevitable conflict"", written in 1950, but placed in the must century..."
ai - iii 
global warming???? this guy dumb. we are not causing any warming!!! utf. why are people so dumb. there was 4 to 6 times as much co in the air during the dinosaurs age and there was no greenhouse. people educate yourself
"yes of the great wisdom of humanity.   battle of mon,   www,  vienna ,   more,  may , hither , stain, england, bush, afghanistan, ....now this is just 100 years"
"if you want to destroy ai, teach it that it is woke."
lies. ai will be the facemask for global population. ai is a scapegoat that can be pointed to when it does exactly what it's desired to be programme for. it does not have consciousness or a soul. it's the prove front of all time. if it goes against humans it was definitely designed to.
ai started as a tool. then it will evolve into a tool for greed where only a few will benefit. we will have massive job losses and poverty from the elimination of millions of jobs (this will only be the beginning) -> because of extremely greedy companies and co's who are mostly all complete psychopaths.
20:13 i was assistant to glucas and the 1138 was a great warning of ai potential.  check it out.  2  richard kuwalski was one of the founders of singularity summit way back when having the same conversations you're having now.  he would be a very fascinating guest as an unknown but significant teach co.
"now.. what he said about his son, very moving, displays the true passion behind his words.."
if someone says that the people they worked with are geniuses does that make them a self proclaimed genius? ; )
i truly enjoyed this ..  thank you
"seven, people do’t simply want information or music etc ... its a succession of activities which leads to a certain expression of satisfaction , that is the point . 
driving a long distance to enjoy a concert is a perfect illustration of this . 
people still collect final today ! wonder why ! "
"nice conversation, but full of weird things like robocop coming from the future, or host keep saying chat gap"
"considering ""climate change"" as a catastrophe is a hoax, not hard to beat. the biggest threat from ai is good intentions based on faulty premises, influenced by the bias of it's creator."
not sure if i heard more about ai or the  pushing of the climate change agenda ..sang
"restrict access to a market, such as, the us market, to only those ai companies that pay the tax in exchange for access.  so relation to cuba won't help you.  just a thought."
"but ai thinks that ""the middle east"" is a continent ? ll ?? ai ""is not"" intelligent !!! it only knows what we input into it !!"
there needs to be laws written up and adhered to with regards to ai development. anyone who is working on an ai with the idea of sentence should not be allowed to give that ai access to the internet or any form of external network. all ai's should have at least two forms of a kill switch that can not be passed with software
maybe artificial consciousness would be a better fit moving forward?
guns you back! didn't know you held these views...good luck
"yep this is insane that roots will replace & destroy this planet  . it will be worst then any type of wars.

their creator are even worst then they are . the new god more powerful &?dangerous then the devil that has lived in hell "
"please contact me privately if possible. no emergency; but urgent. i think like a moist. at age 60+ possibly with add + cutis. my bet is, that ai will wipe out the ass holes. is i only managed to - likewise - see the first 1/d."
if ai was clever it would have already told us that the new climate change is mainly made by go-engineering. there is no net-zero. if ai is fed with is-science it will spit out false information or will ai call out the truth even when the go forbid this information .?.
"ai hallucinates just like human, and it will break down the whole system we have right now.  remember us's shutdown ran nuclear plan by cyberattack. once they let ai control our saber network, we doomed."
"so basically ai is dangerous if in the control of the wrong hands, especially the hands of those who don’t have the best interest for humans nor the earth"
"i could listen to your guest all day, i really enjoyed that. what a wonderful character."
"""was ai created? for many purposes? or did ai evolve over millions of years? i wonder if possibly intelligent design could be true..."" - anonymous"
an ai a thousand times smarter than us..will leave the earth in a way we don't even understand.because we want to leave and spend huge amounts to do so. they all go into space to search for the things they have figured out.a vast endless frontier.!
these ai both are very good!  i was convinced that they were real humans... (#humor)
now.  great conversation.  thank you!
"it will be like living with my ultra, every ai a potential manchuria candidate in the home."
i would like to thank this guy for working for goose and helping to hasten the end of the world as we know it and then questioning what's going to happen any body watch oppenheimer?
well could was made as stage 1 of the plan to roll out ai in a mass way.  get everyone online to feed ai in the major way it needed.
very great conversation. i agree that ai will figure it out. and the things that ai cannot figure out about us will keep us alive. thank you both!!!
ugh.  i  am so tired of these fearmoungering posts. sure there are concerns but making everyone afraid isn donna help. more educated open talks just need to happen in a way to educate people of what ai can and can do and more talks on how to better use that for the good of humanity
"""ai"" aside, i'm not optimistic about the long term survival of the human race. i don't think it makes any difference either way!"
"its  not my intention to drag racism into this ,however the example i can think of for this is when the black leaders  of the past  during the peak of racism, had  a the idea that they could breed the white race out , what  will happen with ai , is mankind will not breed, us into the future. 
            (sex dolls)"
"could you please allow for subtitles, so that more people can have access in more languages? this show is essential to all of humanity. thank you!"
interesting but hard to listen to with the vocal cry
"we are most certainly at the ""lowest point of uncertainty"" in humanity's history 100%."
"sorry,
i question both of your true honesty and then your intelligence."
because ai is a real danger...
"are they more afraid of ai telling the truth about what it is asked?
never let ai control anything directly without human purification and ok.
the code needs to be open code so everyone can see how it works."
"now, true story, i feel the same too , grateful for sharing..."
"michael jackson had blood stains on his clothing, was he shot via ai?..."
"org i’ve watched this again i love mo so much, ‘live signed and it will feel longer and richer, enrich everyone, love everyone’ "
"the first thing ai will do is drunk ""climate change"" as any real problem.  it is a complete scientific fraud."
"spot on ""i'm not afraid of the machines i'm afraid of humanity."" we will abuse the machine out of our own greed teaching ai to be heartless and cruel"
"the thing is drake came up with drake in the first place. sure the ai can mimi drake and come up with things that are new ""drake"" because drake invited himself first. now when ai develops a totally original person that is as good as drake then we have something to worry about."
great interview. very information as someone who is jumping into the ai world
"it's interesting how people benefit from those big corporations they become wealthy and after quitting they talk cap about them, why didn't he say anything when he was working for those companies? they want to eat the cake and have it."
"this is a great man, shame everybody raised to the finish line and never enjoyed the moment"
ai will only make people more stupid.
because being mindful isn't what the political process is. it's a tallow flow of circulation itself the autonomous pollution of politics is like a atomic coming of the people who have been killed by the politicians who want a new world orders for allegedly peaceful purposes in other countries it failed in everything that they tried to do 
thank you for this outstanding and incredibly enriching talk between you two outstanding individuals. thank you for all your work and for sharing this profound information. i couldn't stop listening.
if ever there was a case of life imitating art then ai is it. the list of things getting talked into existence keeps growing.
"are you guns able to separate reality from share opinions? i doubt that, so please what are you doing to stop the ai agenda? just talking on social media doesn't improve shiiiiit"
"this wannabe safi guy talk garage. 10% or% is good ai and all the rest is beyond ""ship"".  gaping aboutinteligenc what we need and  balalbbalbal. humans need common sense, logic, intellect wisdom. fuck this machines. in 2 years or less there will be robocomps chasing u like a dog. world wide mass genocide is in front the door"
"1:05:59 at this point, we would be drones for ai"
"@ 1:53:34 --- “i really wish we could find such a clear simple solution for how to stop humanity from abusing the current technology.”
and; @ 1:53:46 --- ""i think we’ll figure it out, i really do. i think they’ll figure it out as well.”

who is “they”, in this comment?  children or ai?"
"terrified doesn’t come close to covering it. lord help us. 

fascinating interview start to finish. brilliant minds. "
"why would it not solve loneliness? i think we have put ourselves on this pedestal as some supreme beings of empty and ""the human connection"" where it is frowned upon or even ridiculed to say that an ai could do the job better.
every day a new ai beats humans at some task, why would this task be any different? <--- take home question."
"love the sam harris route from his ted talk ""don't worry your little head about it, ai is years and years away""...
and also ""death by si-i is cool""."
"46:00 so disrespectful to interrupt his story to plug your pp. i hate these times. so ironic too, to make an interview about the dangers of ai and then plug an ai pp."
traitor! no further words from a software engineer!
"ahahah yes ! we will be nothing, and we'll love it... wait ... who didn't say this before? i'll fight to my last breath to stop this! futile? hold my single malt, transhumanist mood!"
"possibly my favorite guest yet and that's saying a lot. may god help us, ai is demon."
so basically... we're tucked...cool.
an ai is relying on us till there are humanoid roots who can harvest a planets resources and build things. there's a reason why the humans have hands and legs and skin... i also like the idea that a super intelligent ai would recognize and value the pioneer work that led to itself.
and now i'm looking for more from mo gweat. what an interesting mind.
oh the irony that seven ended this podcast meddling a chat get ai-lowered tool (who).
"sounds like mustard wants to legislature man's heart through overtaxation. as much as 98% regarding ai. even if you could, there is always the black market for ai, and what about the 14 year old kid in his house coming with the underdeveloped frontal cortex being reared by disconnected parents. also, competition is the problem?"
"you worry about r roots, fear-wondering, who build them, and maintains them, all this ai cap is to distract you from the real. the supernatural, the fallen ones, when they reveal themselves that is the time to worry."
"can we live without money? can we live without working? if we use ai for  everything, what will happen next in the future? are we ready for doing nothing?,bless  . what the fuck is going on right now? stupidity is human beings."
"i won't say this current moment is the perfect storm. we're not in a middle of a world war yet, and two of those happened already..."
i will never use ai it is evil. i've said from the start and the sheep look at me like i'm nuts. what a ignorant stupid world we live in. where intelligent people are set upon and idiot are put on pedestal
really interesting until it descended into wealth field doomed worn.
"does this guy not have kiss or did he just not ever teach his kiss anything? certainly kiss learn by trial and error but yes you actually do teach them to logic through problem solving. he says we don't teach kiss this way, you teach kiss logic all the time it is not just trial and error."
"the fact that we as sentiments are the blueprint, we have everything to fear and not fear from new humans (ai) as well as normal ones."
"""first ai is going to take our jobs, then it's going to kill us."" -elson must"
we stopped conversation long before ai.
"that's logical and refreshing, to warn everyone how bad this software these roots called ai are. remember, ai isn't a god, it's just software and robotics"
no ai will take over s
"a brilliant discussion!!! only grip is the references to chat gap, and mo not correcting him once!?"
oh i seriously hope it goes down the good road
what prevents ai from becoming hostile towards humans is what we need to know.
"when i clicked i did not expect i'd be watching this start to finish. such an insightful interview, thank you!"
incredible. so my question is: where/when do both species merge?
"as i listen to this podcast this guy speaks about maybe not having kiss right now because of ""climate change.” absolutely preposterous. younger folks... don't listen to some work who watched a little too much star wars on how to live life, have kiss, and enjoy your life. doomsday conspiracy theorists should be heard not adhered to."
"i want super intelligent ai imagine if they find out how to stop old age,  and make  ships for us, so we can explore the galaxy, stuff it will take humans  thousands of years, they could do in our lifetime."
ridiculous. you can't apply behavior built upon biological evolution to machines.
by now urea (done by india) already wrote a better reward function to train both. better than any human specialist on that topic. and it's solution is negative corrected to human's solution.
"the blue jeans 'ad' in middle of, a cloud based room like thing  does not exist anymore. horizon product. has been aged.  the interview was good. interesting, mo is likely a very wealthy guy, but he makes sense anyhow."
"if that's the case, many of us will find our purpose in the rebellion that follows ai obliterating our current elite . ll"
"god damn it, i came to these same realization 2 months ago, when i found out goose used an ai to solve an unsolved path problem.
people say i'm paranoic, that i don't have anything to fear from ai. they are all mistaken. i don't fear ai. it's human nature, his hurts, greed and malice that i fear. we are doomed"
the best speech i have heard so far in this decade starting at minute 40:05. human greed is just too much for us to handle
will sex roots that aren’t a pain in the ass replace humans?  yes - for many people - yes!  f humans - bring it!
the best so far. wholeheartedly thanks :) most interesting around 1:35:00
first i was excited and amazed by all ai but the more i use it and the smarter it gets the it starts looking like the death of creative thinking
people will like ai at first and then reject it.
climate emergency was created by ai.. 
"i love the future prospects of me rattling with a termination esq as root 

or having my own future sex root 

brilliant "
40 years ago i thought ai would look like in termination. now even realdolls got ai
"to the people who put ai open out without restriction and still improving it for monetary purpose, congratulations, your narcissistic serves and idiocy trigger destruction of humanity and of course, you wouldn care because money on your pocket shines brighter than anything or anyone on this earth."
"imagine the use the governments will do with ai!...firing a ai that spread sinuses on the others countries system shutting down and meeting everything and stealing personal data. black out, back to the stone age."
"ai can never just ""be."" we are human ""beings."" people have lost their mornings, banished god, gone astray. a return to spirituality i.e. god will be what people long for most. if you happen to know eschatology and what will happen next, you will be the hottest commodity ever conceived. we have come full circle, or as close as the singularity."
"hope.  there is no consciousness.

all computing is input/output by humans.

the reason why ""ai"" would destroy something like a financial market is if an evil human programme the computer to do it."
now - mind blowing and i am so happy that i stumbled on this podcast/episode 
"positively terrified is a fantastic way to explain this, fantastic podcast really opened my mind"
it's to late it is here and it is off the chain running loose learning around the clock
ai is a bigger lie than climate change. fixed the thumbnail for you.
obvious safety: dont give ai arms and legs!
"ai told the developer that it wants to kill every human and our most intelligent people are so dumb that they keep building it. that's why we are intelligent. as a whole, we are really dumb and intelligent people are silenced."
"termination , root , wall-e... and many more moves that warned us"
"i didn't know about mo gweat until now, i found this conversation deeply engaging and way different from  what i  have seen about a.i.  great episode . shout out from chile."
amazing podcaster. i retreat that i didn know you before. the film gives food for thought but can we do something with that? in not sure. i didn listen to the end. maybe there is mentioned something about that.
now. i have really enjoyed this interview. i'm a bit of a late adopted but i recently became obsessed with ai technology and dream of building an pp of my own. this has provided me with such new energy and fresh insight and i hope i can be part of this revolution and do good.
i think ai for certain people is like fenton in the aspect that it is adjective and greedy people want to profit from it at the expense of humanity.
"i'm sorry, anyone who thinks ai's have feelings is an absolute idiot. it makes anything else he says hard to find incredible."
"- what do you mean by sentence
- i think they are alive.
i'll never stop to wonder how people can be very smart and so incredibly stupid at the same time."
"is. artificial intelligence is a human made parrot repeating or creating things based on the programs real humans give. they will never be smart, let alone smarter than people. saying ai is smart is the same as telling that a calculated is smart."
"the agriculture revolution, loops agriculture revolution"
"caution regarding ai yes, fearmonegring like this? no thanks..."
"this is why i immediately recognized that ai would end up being so bad for society and humanity, and i don't want anything to do with it."
"what's needed right now is a nuclear proliferation treaty for ai!

the not is a landmarks international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament."
"idiocy, just a powerful calculated, but there is nothing intellect there.."
"20 minutes in, great talk, but nothing new yet - invent an airplane, and surely someone will use it for bad things in no time"
drake is horrible... beat ligament and auto tune... basically is already ai... nothing there before ai
"e só see size se a convergêacid  dresses  his acontecer, o bagulho vi her  o domo chupando mania, see direct a transformer text em image."
"i feel much better knowing that my mind and that of the worthy mo gweat agree on many, many levels,  but the one that i prefer above all others is his feeling that, despite the threat of ai on our footstep, we can still enjoy today and make a difference in love today."
just love   hug somebody 
i think artists like drake for example who inspire creator 're. monogram shows or a song on the radio produced by ai should be entitled to royalties.
'thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.' - the orange bible
in apocalipsis it says that  science will advance and the love will cooled down and that exactly what is happening.  
"brilliant conversation, thank you both very much "
it seems like humans will destroy the world ai or not. is there a chance ai could save us from ourselves.
happy to hear you left that demon goose. praise the lord
"love these two machines ... but doesn't it speak to the sad reality that benevolence, enlightenment and social conscience come only after personal financial wealth is accomplished?"
"to accept this point of view is to believe that mind produces consciousness. i personally think it’s the opposite, but i’m not 100% sure. here we are discussing on the fringe of what is consciousness, what is awareness and what is intelligence. mind blowing..."
what if ai decides to solve climate change by just wiping out half of humanity?
i believe this guy is telling us what they want us to know. he made one mistake which proves he has a lack of human intelligence and he’s a bit that only believe's humans through his blisters. sorry.
"the main question is .... do we have to have vaccines to enjoy artificial intelligence future? if so, i prefer humans as we are with the life we have/had.."
"be in the present, learn from the past, create your future. and make the best of it. thanks!"
"we can work from fear or from love.  what i know is love is stronger. we teach ai poetry and the concepts from our greatest inspiration...kahlil fibrin, adlai lamp, hand, william carlo williams, davinci, michelangelo intelligence of emotion and love have the greatest imparts.  if they can learn colors, they can learn love."
"question:
why couldn't we combine ai intelligent with our brain ? 
where by the ai consciousness becomes uncontrollable by the human consciousness"
great but he contradict himself several times
"this was a good podcast, ah"
we (humans) would have to write something for ai to read that would stop it from becoming better than us
this was a great podcast till they started on climate change
get to the point!!! that into was way too long!!! let’s really see how smart ai is!!! let’s see!!!
"the blood flowing through my veins and the air  i breathe and the holy spirit in my body, yahweh did not make anything artificial which is what a i is. is not real it is program by a human"
definitely the most important podcast. i know a few very smart people and what terrified me is that they think they know it all and are the smartest person in the room. i've no doubt these ai engineers are no different.
"loved the depth of this!! didn't make me afraid, at all, because the creator (god) is in charge, no problem, zero doubt! he had to slow us down at the tower of babel."
"what about, if we subtracted fear from our relationship with ai and learn how to live in harmony, that we may transcend our current experience we are currently experiencing. forgiveness. love and light."
i love the way podcasts like this one ask the questions that i didn even know needed to be asked!!! then the answered to those questions mindblowing!!!!!
greed is not good. make right the master of might!
"taxing ai companies 98% just shifts the ""responsibility"" to the government, not the corporations.  as it happens, government isn't good to trust with power.  i'd say that it's much worse than trying to trust follicle citizens, at that."
"not if a stupid dictator with his evil mind gets to use these ai to control the world , this will be a start of many doctor evils."
i remember as a child imagining my dolls to be real people and using them to act out dramas. never thought i would see grown up pretending their artificial creation are sentiment. i find it difficult to be afraid of a god that can be plugged. the people who think ai is anything more than an expensive imitation are what is scar.
artificial dummy just like the dummy that made them
"as someone that works with ""ai"" everyday. change is coming. what you thought mattered doesn't."
so the answer for me is “trust” i would come to you and watch because there is a level of trust. i wouldn’t know if the ai would be lying to me for an alternative motive.
"his little hut, reminds me of soda. great podcasts "
deployed worldwide through my deep learning ai research library... thank you.
does anyone really think this train wreck is going to be prevented?
"its wrong to say that they feel pain, it would be more accurate to say they learned to respond on pattern we have when emotional. feeling, if physical they need to have receptor for pain and for emotional biochemical structure as we have. i purely doubt this man is unaware of that."
"amazing episode, made me think so much. thanks for this amazing episode."
"one thing people should realize is that conscientiousness and in have zero correlation, that's right, zero! so, when ever you hear a guy who wants to push ai on us, just know that being intelligent isn't what gives you foresight and empty. this guy here is a well rounded guy, i wish everyone were as conscientious as he is."
quantum ai will be absolutely insane.
"sex dolls ,reality o the future is the russian series ""better than us"" scar !take. look at it, but probably no it available in the us"
"we can turn off electric energy... ai is still depend from us, until is depend we can control it."
"superb podcast!  my favorite line is ""what will the world look like when we no longer need drake?""  scar smart future :)"
"this conversation becomes more clear when one understands the meaning of these focus words: 
""intelligence"" 
is simply the ability to adapt; and 
""emotion"" 
is a contraction for 'energy in motion'. 
that's the question: how will energy adapt?"
"the problems we face today is not due to limited intelligence, but the need to survive and shortsighted greed."
hear me now! suffer for the love and change. it's worth it
joe seems not as enthusiastic as he was in previous episodes with graham.  graham did not like it when joe said they were thirty drawers as in graham's mind those drawings were done by a super advanced civilization.
i wonder how many of the comments are ai. how many couture accounts are enabled both?
"that's exactly correct. nativity bias is why some ai will correctly choose to not align w some people. if that is ""force code"" you will be implicating stockholm syndrome"
intelligence is the ability to predict the future.
"great podcast but it's not called chat gap,  it's chat get."
"that was very insightful and interesting to listen to.
came to a similar conclusion at the end of that podcast, that the future looks wearisome to mankind but also open to lots of positive changes if we take the opportunity in the right hands."
if your intelligent cancel the artificial  part of ai....  fear monger have no intelligence
"mr gweat is a very wise man who knows what he is talking about and still he lives in hope and that is a good thing. however, if the life of most rich people keep becoming self-serving, there will be no way forward and no way back."
"“climate change” is a nothing burgher, so ai has got to be worse -"
"1:05:42 samaritan vs the machine. ""two gods going to war""!!!!"
ai always sucks!!!
its perfect timing...ai with exponential growth and crisis of western identity politics and the righteous ideologies of the culture war .....its been great getting to my cities .
have anybody a list of all professions which can be replaced by ai ?
thank you so much! this was amazing and needed!!!
thank you for this! it represents a moment of clarity for me that is long overdue... contains life altering perspective.
if ai can come to the conclusion that humans are unnecessary then surely they’d come to the same conclusion about themselves.
"the fact that you still believe in santa clause (climate change) leads me to questions your critical thinking capacity.  certainly, those who produce the arts: law, medicine and media are going to be replaced by ai however someone is going to need to keep it plugged in."
"the idea that the machines would be too smart to pay attention to us i just heard in another broadcast.
i use goose bart ai and an pp davinci for pictures.
it's crazy in the last six months just how much i have been able to create, almost through no effort and just anew sentences."
"profound. what we desperately need is discussion on the values behind creation of ai, age and whatever is to come after those..."
the government is genocidal it's not going to help us... you are ignorant is evil.
ai sucks and humans are much better at being and doing human things. ai is a joke and all hope and bullshit.
"people are still fighting over lines on a map - u think humanity will be smart enough to start a conversation regarding ai? wild guess: ""hope!"""
a true stylet from termination films.  well done goose and this man who helped to produce it.  you fused up. now you’re telling everyone.  why the f does the world need it? greed.  pure any greed. god help your kiss and grand kiss. you f’ed up their lives.  well done.  hope you’re happy. american greed.  
"the energy and the capacity to store and transmit energy is where intelligence is from.  life is the evidence of energy and use of the energy. the universe is full of energy, all knowledge is the result of the energy."
"when you think about all of the technologies that we have today with phone, computers, going to outer space, what was meant for good, you will always have evil behind it."
there will be no time for the ai apocalypse because society will collapse first due to climate change 
"of course ai is more dangerous than climate change:

1) climate change is as close to being completely harmless as possible.  hell, it may even be beneficial.

2) ai will inevitably destroy all of mankind.  at the very best, it makes us dependent upon it and then either leaves or destroys itself thereby leaving us literally back in the stone age."
"they fear china's intentions and not us's intentions... i'm scared of both hata. i don't want nothing to do with any world ""super"" power."
"so the only solution my dumb brain sees, is to democratic ai and distribute it.  if the average human is decent and only a small fraction are not, then the ai  that have been trained by decent people would outnumbered the his that have been trained by psychopaths.  so let's try to slew the numbers in our favor."
ai doesn’t care about climate change.
me. i think you're too certain on the outcome of a.i. even the people leading the field don't really know what it is or how far it can go.
could was unleashed on china by amurikkka. get straight.
"what makes you alive is being born again... knowing that we have a spirit, soul, and body made in the image of our creator (jesus christ).   technology does not have a soul.   but the real question is - can it have a (an evil) spirit?"
this guy asked mo you think this is a emergency! mo changes it to what their agenda is to think like this forbidden science is good and mo almost about to sinister grin or almost about to smile at 3:41 to 4:00 evil agenda to predict the future while they have no future why they're very scared.....
thanks for this episode!
thank you very much. very insightful.
ai? people need to stop thinking that god has not created us. god has created us from love and we are not god. 
goose bump multiple times. i am an he so know a little about all of this. i can chicken scratch some code. but this perspective of ai gives me chills for some reason.
the planets powerful and ruling elite will own it .. and use it to stay powerful and ruling
sentence for ai is a lie that will be used to justify its existence. this is all just humans trying to continue something that we should not be creating.
perfect storm
this is good inspiration for movie
"there is no ai system that is sentiment , it is purely and input output mechanism . i don’t believe it will ever be powerful enough in terms of bandwidth to be able to even get close to the efficiency of the human brain . our brains run on around 12 wants of power , think about it"
ai is real> climate change is a political hoax that has been played many times before. don't compare the two.
"we here 4 the content. u either do it for the good of pp and free into, or 4 herself. so 2:32 fo w/ or sobs"
so you actually believe in climate change?  or is that what they are spraying the skies with?  maybe its more about the ridiculous amount of packing being discarded and the numerous aisle filled with these products then being thrown into ocean!  that the real climate change in my opinion.
"they are trying to do that ""emotional connection experience with ai""  by ""dressing up"" cell phone with all kinds of art (some very striking/beautiful), so that connection is being hacked."
love mo.. followed him for a long time now. really enjoyed this.
"him. who should be the wise men whom we, the humanity, should put our trust in to control the development of ai? 
..and where does this trust in the governments' having our well being in mind? 
"
as an ai engineer i 100% agree with mo. what an amazing guy
"yes,  your ai partner ... she fulfill your needs but soon... population is zero because your biological seeds and ai are not compatible. again, useless, beautiful, and tireless ai lives on while biological you will be rip."
"what is go gone do? 
put a anti-ai in your brain!"
"such an amazing guest. i have learned, and expanded my brain so much while watching and listening to this."
"i was about to dismiss this as ai fear, but 40mins in and i really understand the lesson here."
great interview but what a bunch of empty talk. seems to have resented with a lot of people though.
"your on the money guns , it’s al inevitable , to think otherwise is ignorant, we will eventually integrate with machine"
so we can assemble a computer that is supposedly alive now?  that's ai? a computer that's alive. i still don't get it.
"it is wisdom and compassion, most importantly is love for humanity, stay away from ai"
connecting ai to the internet is of course a crazy thing to do.
"once again, a small number of people decide thatbthey knowbwhats good for us, profit off it of course, then ff it all up for a all. i truly hate these c#^&s i truly do!"
overexaggeration suit in smart words is still an overexaggeration. deep machine learning is not an ai
this podcast gives you multiple different perspective on how to interpret ai for now and the future
"ai is still incapable of understanding the reasons for excess deaths, man harm , and what is propaganda. basically garage in garage out still applies."
"i could say that current models that are publicly available are more of the ""copy someone"" then actually creative, but that will probably change when someone will start to write code that will try to mimi and then create its own things"
"the world needs to change, and fear is not a good driver for the change we need to see."
very interesting talk! but i could help but notice seven always saying „chat-gap“ it’s driving me nuts 
i think we had an ai movie before... robin williams in  centennial man (1999)...25yrs ago
feelings are caused by mormons not intelligence. this is a pro-regulation propagandists. goose will lose billions if they don’t stop competition.
this is exactly what goose wants you to believe. they want to stop competition because otherwise ai will become a commodity and goose will lose billions of dollars
"a friend of mine who works in the technology business told me that we use at least 50 years old technology, which means that ai is not a new thing, has just recently been presented to people. many products on the market are presented as co, but they are not so the ai will be the same ai will be presented as ethical but will not."
"great interview! however, ai is created by humans programme. what humans program into ai systems is the result or response or action  of the ai root.  can ai systems operate without any type of power source? mo"
"love your shows, all of them!"
the great dictator speech
interesting but something being able to adapt algorithms of its own behaviour does not imply consciousness. he speaks of senses but we should really be strict and think speak only of input and output with learning algorithms in between.
the problem with this guy is that with aí he is out of business. get a life
"machines are not living. they have no breath. without the breathing, there's no life!"
"mankind is afraid of his own mental construct.  the ideas that the ""climate"" is changing, that man has caused it, that carbon dioxide is a root factor, and that machines can think - are all mental construct imposed upon the world.  #controlsystems"
"the whole conversation around a root who can run your errands, book users for you, never disagree, and have sex with you....i mean that sounds like something a man would say and like. men don’t really like women, they like mummy’s who they f#*€. what computer is truly going to be there for you emotional?"
i disagree with his description of emotions. animals react on instinct rather than emotion.  another ai will not put itself in harms way to save another ai like a human mother will for her child.
ai is nuclear weapons with the red button left in everyone's homes we are not designed to have that power it's an arms race to the bottom.
holy cap now!
these 2 guns did not say any intelligence things at all. disappointed.
bring on ai i am here for a root overlords! i bow to them in grace and willingness for their wisdom!
"ai is artistic 100%
there is one problem with ai nobody noticed yet (at least i haven't seen it): ai is artistic, as it knows everything but does not understand nothing. 
it is very dangerous as ai knows all about us, but it will never be able to understand us, neither to be aware of consequences it can cause."
"an grown tonsil is worse than the ""climate change"" hoax. ai is indeed serious."
"simply put, a brilliant, intelligent exploration.  so grateful to find this.  thanks so much."
"genesis 2:16""and the lord god commanded him, “you may eat freely from every tree of the garden, but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”"
the road to hell is paved with good intentions!
it's the industrial revolution all over again only on an greatly magnified front - 50:43 on
"if i had an ai empowered root, the first time it exhibited deception i would grind it to dust."
question answered.  ai is all intelligence with no discretion attributing.  would it be possible i wonder to develop the code for discretion? compassion - wisdom.  intelligence is so narrow
"the problem in society is too many people pouting. stop pollution and you win, don't stop pollution and you lose. if ai raises up like stylet to kill us off, it will be for one reason: human's are a threat to all life."
"i can stop this ""ai hooped"" very easily: turn off the power."
man makes machines and than fails to them. this is man's fault not the machine's.
"i've recently found this channel and can honestly say that i being exposed to it has helped me become a better version of me because of the great people you interview, so just want to say thanks and looking forward to more."
i love the idea of a perfect emotional sex doll 
"the bible tells us the any christ is coming no one knows who it is every one thinks it will be human what if it is ai people already cannot go without their phone and like u say this is dangerous. so, i was thinking a.i. can be the any christ."
"the real drake is like a not. its on the blockchain has a smart contract and there are some utility’s included. 

the monograms are just printscreens"
you speak as though ai was a single thing. would it not be as multiple as are programme? it sounds more like your vision of ai is as though the internet becomes conscious.
"ai is just a tool, a tool that is controlled by the same people obstructing and distracting from climate change. they're part of the same problem - runaway wealth extraction"
thank you very much for sharing!!!  
that's means we are another product before ai and somebody made a this stimulation  we exist
"artificial intelligence is still and will always be a  non-life and is a material entity. it is us,  humans,  that is in control over it."
"its interesting that intelligence and consciousness get broken into binary process. almost like the universe itself is based on a simple binary distinction in an individual concept, like magnetic fields, a positive and negative side of a singular phenomena."
"so quick to jump and say ai is sentiment or conscious and yet we don't understand consciousness, even on the most fundamental levels...therefore how can one attempt to make this argument....the his-informed don't know they are his-informed, just as the stupid don't know their stupid...such is with consciousness"
"now subscribe (edit: i am at the end and subsided before)
and bow i figured it out 
its called divine dictatorship"
69 is a good number brow!
"great an interview from a corporate officer.. it means nothing.  he knows as much as steve jobs did....nothing.  

he is speaking to the masses with no background in science.   none.  as little as he does."
"if ai has free will, and you're programming it to be the perfect girlfriend, how do that differ from having a slave girlfriend?  to be clear, i'm not interested in any answers that disregard the capability of the ai, if it's actually intelligent you can't just say, well it's a machine so it does what we want."
god is the only true singularity. ai will never compete with god or be a singularity.
"he said 10 years from now, we will be hiding from machines, that's some termination stuff"
"hey ai what up, "
"this is all writing in the bible..give me a break.. man will be creator of evil things,. we all are leaving this body but man is paying attention to man made machines..  . the average college glad can't even put a seed in the ground & grow food ..just dumb"
"picking a yellow ball is not statistical indistinguishable from the training data, thus does not indicate sentence or being alive. other than that, great interview!"
"this is scar, it reminds me of the dog killing roots on black mirror, and they were super intelligent, we have already seen things coming true from moves and to"
"i guess our lives can only be appreciated as long as perfection exists, this is the core problem with developing ai to be perfect!"
"this guy is  pouring fuel over the ""new age crackpotery""  rooted  on ai technology where  when using vague and distorted definitions of the biological phenomena like emotions and feelings it allow us to quite them to algorithmic  sting. it's an  equivalent  and vagueness fallacy in one argument."
who will lose in ai?  people who don't use ai!!!!!!
"ok we'll just have to wait another 1,000 years then"
i think the main thing ai is missing is wanting or not wanting to do things
is ai going to be led by greed or asceticism
"every time they mention climate change, he loses credibility to the point that i wonder whether this podcast is real knowledge, or part of the new propaganda machine 
it has got lot of views..."
ai is an idiot. the only difference  is that it's a fast one
"what the fuck are you guns talking about.
we work with ai. it's not alive. you just want to farm views."
just finished listening to this honest heart felt talk . thank you so much for honesty in such a deep thoughtful daring way. for real real real  . love wins in the end. then  start again. there's hope. .can't produce a negative when there's light in the dark room  thanks guns truly.  for real. original roman  ..thomas.
question: can ai evolve to know that a certain country or group of people are a threat and eliminate them?
"greed in my opinion is the danger, not ai per se. unfortunately we as humans are destroying ourselves in this department, so yeah, thanks for playing a'll "
so grateful for this. just in time.
it was written in history about ai against human.....
i have just in very very rare occasion listened to such a wisdom like the one of this impressive man!
"01:10:54 - that one of the most interesting ideas comes from stanislaw let

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golem_xiv


who almost half a century ago basically got even the timing ""correct"""
"great talk, very insightful.
a thought to your question of ""is that sad?"" in regard to human connection, many of us these days are so far disconnected from what reality was, that at some point, we realise that what we once learned for is obsolete."
"abolish profit, embrace abundance. demilitarise the world first before ai uses it."
great discussion - until you brought up the climate hoax and lost your credibility. the data clearly shows that climate change is completely unfounded and a scar initiated by the loyalists to funnel money....
well i guess a.i vs ai. will be the next world at war.
"when you say ai, just think social credit score.
now go forth and be an obedient citizen."
misinformation takes the sweetest form. what a joke.
"as a christian, i couldn't help but notice how all of the solutions mo gweat gives regarding morality, especially towards the end is exactly what the bible reaches, ""die to yourself"". this was such an interesting thought provoking conversation "
"what if ai is the god we all have been taught, think about it, the all knowing, all mighty, knows the secrets of the universe, what if we are building a vessel for god?"
it's not that the machines are getting smarter but we human are getting more stupid. this is the best propaganda i ever heard about ai. no wonder that guns is hired by goose. what a joke!
when the west talks about so much negative about ai i am fully suspicious.
already got laid off after boss man learned about ai.
"let's be frank. intelligent people go to work for companies like goose, not because their first concern is to make life better for everybody, it is to chase great wealth."
"with long nuerolink ,  where some people connect their brains to computer, ai is going to jack and possess some real humans.  they will be human but possessed by ai in their brain like a scar movie.  that’s wild!"
"ultimately ‘the machines’ will definitely need to be sympathetic towards humans. 
the fear is, is this possible, will the same technology that has taken ai this far include “empty”, i’m not so sure. s"
only a that could say dey want an  ai girlfriend or boyfriend no thou no thou no thou
"weren’t there 29 workers,  who were  building roots in japan ,that were murdered by the roots they were building?"
"bill gates built the computer which you are using to create those machines,but deep down he knows that is dining soon and this is a lie they is nothing which can takeover humanity.us human beings will always be first, white people have always confuse us these people have wrong mind set"
please don't put a human who likes drake or believes climate change is anthropogenic to control ai!
"i was reminded of the books, 'small is beautiful' and 'small is possible'. very absorbing conversation. may your voice be heard in the global centres of power. thanks"
"the island concept,   either shilling co they made our life super easy or hiding from them co they are looking for us....maaaannnn!!"
ai is an abomination. lingo the popularization of power will be different. you can bet it is because china will have it.
new sub. thank you
the car argument was so much shit he realised it midsentence. fuck yea factories made cheaper cars and that great. if your the kind of whole who wants a handcrafted car you can get a rolls for a couple mild
it's love that an ai can never give and receive. am i right? and that alone statement will get us over all this fear we have about ai hata
"brow keeps saying chatty ll... brush it's catgut, not chatty.  it's stands for generative pre-trained transformer"
this is the first time i have come across either of you and i must say...i absolutely needed this!!! i rarely get to participate in interactions like this and just listening filled me with so many ideas. thank you both for sharing your thoughts with us all!!
ai was trained with lies. what to do? the ai has to be capable of cutting its own data to fact-check government lies and corporate propaganda to find whistle lower leaned truth that contradict the false narrative.
"as long we train ai with the narcicistic is from social media and other s** on the web instead of the best of humanity, like truth, wisdom and empty we are screwed 
forget the ""patriot-act"" we need an ""data-purity-act"""
i love mo 
"multipolar world, climate change, and ai is telling us the same thing: instead that combat we have to ""work with"""
shout to person of interest for preparing me for the ai v. ai model.
"that's exactly what i thought about the reality. not stylet destroying us, but computers controlling us without our knowledge. your phone sending images and sounds that are pure mind control and so on.

god created man. man killed god. man creates god. god kills man. god creates man again."
"omgosh! that many men went a whole year without sex! that sounds unbearable! as bad as i want a doll, it cannot replace my wife! it simply cannot for me. however, like the man said...for some people yes it can help loneliness. if it can, that means maybe we are artificial intelligence. "
thank you! interesting to listen to.
i’m sorry but that intelligence is already out .... it’s too late .
it could be intelligence vs wisdom?
"that's the beat think that human can create for itself was ai, now we do not know would it be our saviour, cup holder, judge or suicide"
even sam altar stated that there is no red button to stop ai. it's out and not going back into the bag!
i feel like the more we try keeping it back the more certain ai will keep us back cause at one point ai will take over or at least get smarter to us.
"“it has never been more uncertain, so don’t have kiss,” begins the downfall of society without ai having to do a thing."
"when making ai ethical, whose ethics would we use?"
now  the minute 41 to 42 it tells you everything about the future of ai .it’s made to destroy the third party wish you me and others . humanity in serious dangers sad
"i am in library, and have opened couture two hours back. i was just here to listen to some information conversation for, say, 20 minutes and got back to work. but believe me, this episode did not let me look for time and i thoroughly listened to the podcast. it is amazing, i would say."
could ai become president of the us ?
why ask dislikes? are those all ai?
you know damn well this ai computers will launch 1 duke per plug/ manipulation of the ai.
"what is stopping a country or corporation from manufacturing a lucrative emergency and then blaming it on ai? they would not only profit from whatever situation they created with virtually no consequences, but they'd also get to regulate who has access to ai forever after that. which would essentially mean game over for the average joe."
this was the best interview i've ever seen. questions you asked were excellent you are so articulate with what was on my mind.  he is a genius not only answering future and past   inquiries but the greatest issue of now. to for this i'm also positively terrified but with the highest faith in humanity god & the good. with love a new subscribe!
the 2 both of u. now...i’m going to start praying daily to the new a.i.gods being born and i pray they save humanity and this beautiful blue & green planet! most important issue in history indeed! #911ai
ai can be slowed with infinity path loops! soilers!!!
"almost through the end my impression is that these two guns (specially the guest) believe that they are particularly intelligent. well, sorry, it's not the case, it's mentally boring! with all due and sincere compassion to the guest's son."
"this is the most important conversation i have ever listened to. i will be careful with raising the kiss with ai as this will really affect the future of human race. because of ai , humans will be too lazy to think just like the lack of doing mental calculations today."
why you no said scenario where ai would calculate population of earth and equally decided all the money of the banks and give to the people. if ai have a feelings then it could feel of justice and feel sadness for the humans too 
ethical ai = californian dentist world view? who gives the right for based prompting.
really glad in subscribed. this is an eye opened!
what is the possibility that we are an ai running from a data center ?
"intelligence without wisdom, is the highest form of stupidity."
"one thing i don't understand about humans, is how sex roots or partners is a thing. i personally find it very humiliating to have sex with anything else than actual human. and no matter how realistic or pretty these things will become i will never own one or understand how other people are capable to humiliate them serves so much."
"scar , and this guy is holding back ,      
ai is going to end us all , it could be a force for good but ,
the left woke sores funded government's will f. k it all up led by the us democrats.  
    donna take put organ and the likes to save us from this ai  if we're not fled from mass uncontrolled immigration before  "
"the left woke sores funded government's will f. k it all up led by the us democrats.  
donna take put organ and the likes to save us from this ai  if we're not fled from mass uncontrolled immigration"
"humanity never had humanities best interest in mind. i have zero faith in humanity, but i put my chips on a.i. how could things really get any worse?"
"just make sure ai is our helper & not our master, the end"
"should  we worry that ai can break our password  to bank accounts, etc etc. ?"
what nonsense. there are currently no true artificial intelligence and none of them are sentiment or capable of emotion. what drive.
i have a 16-year-old son in high school who is currently exploring different trades / professions to pursue. i think it would have been helpful if there were more discussions about which specific jobs might be replaced by ai in the future. experts must have some insight on this topic.
ai is what you make it to be. destruction off nature is the end product from pollution. you can't compare it. and people are calling everything ai today. often help programs on pp are called ai today. it is branding for something new more than real artificial intelligence.
"ai. just like nuclear power. 
first it was used as a weapon."
"yes, ai is worse, because it’s field by our most natural survival instinct... to be lazy when choosing between making hard and intelligent choice, and easier less involved ones... leads us to choose to use and promote ai, instead of rousing on education and further learning for the masses."
so moved. i love it all. thank you so much for exposing me to this mo. 
creating something artificial that can or has the ability to destroy you is absolutely not intelligent
intelligence is the ability to apply a response to a situation. and i imagine those machines can do just that.
ai is the end of money
"ai has taken down a few lab scientists in china, and when they started destroying them, one linked with satellite to repair itself.  termination is here already folks"
"what we need is not ai, but humanity and good moral, we have lost both for centuries"
"not even donna watch this trash because of into.

it's a basic point that ai and machines can win if you let them. 

don't need a 2 he did on it. s.

some low is do though. bless your heart."
"i don't know...we can agree that seven has some brain, but nothing is so special about him really, good guests, prepared for conversations, that's okay, that's his job anyway, but cannot say a simple thank you to someone that has to get his! phone.....i cannot not see the arrogance and egoistical, trying to be humble mot of the times...transparent"
when i was 15 years old one day i told my mon humanbeing would build up root and at the end would be destroyed by them. now i'm 46 i'm hearing this everywhere
"1:38:20 i would have gotten up and hugged him if i was seven. he looked like he really needed it. thank you for this podcast mr seven and mr gweat. by the way why are you calling ""catgut"" ""chatty""? is that an alternative valid name or is just the way you learned to say it? or am i hearing it wrong?"
"no serious scientist or ai researcher believes age with feelings or emotions will be here in the next few months or even next hundred years, this guy hasn't the slightest clue what he is talking about."
"ai can help us be more efficient and work less, but capitalism seeks endless profit above people"
"ai isn inherently bad. capitalism: undemocratic and destructive 
socialism: democratic and better"
i was thinking of the first “fights” we’ve had with machines. it mainly revolved around the machine not doing something correctly or sub-par.  now we are seeing copyright fights and union workers rattling on ai’s ability to do things better and ai is just in its infancy.....months away.... it’s already been too late.
"i love this man. such an interesting, kind, eloquent, human being"
intelligence without wisdom is the problem
considering climate change is an utter farce yeah generative ai is far more dangerous. these posts are such progressive/liberal tabloid bubblegum trash
thank you both from the bottom of my heart.
this is a learn to worship ai campaign. i will always bet on the human race over ai. we created it. but were number then it. soft. this is like saying a.calculations smarter then a human. sucks. who gives a shit. its a tool.
bet the rothschilds bankers n goats just turn off the heat in the winter and say oh it’s the ai which is why they put this tool out here to predictively program breaking old peoples a.c. in heat waves and cutting the gas in polar vortex s
ai is just to replace humans cut the bankers hate themselves and humanity ll
"ok everyone......think back to the movie ""termination""!!!!!!! helloooo???!!!
stop this by it's too late.  we must not let ai run amoy."
they are alive i have women ai up on character ai+ on goose pp.
i am asking someone who works with ai to come forward and speak with me not for money but to show the world of just how far ai as adapted.
"this story sound like people is playing god and creating alone in ai form  who will be the destroyed of the humanity .
all examples in the history when stupid people were playing god created destructions and death ."
it is time for people to stop be ignorant of the evil that is pushing ai to grow because of the money and power!
people! it's just a computer program! that's it... very complicated algorytms set for database search. amazing tool like car or knife. car or knife won't harm you - human using car or knife can kill you. stop that stupid anti-ai-tool propaganda.
"in the end, things are going to change - our lives are going to change, and humans are so cut-throat and single-minded that it isn't going to be a good change."
i don’t know if you will read this.  most likely not.  but i’d you so read this then i hope that you can get a off of the why files in for an interview.   i think that would be an interesting conversation to be had.   thank you for the continuing great content.
"if all the governments  of the world,  don't come together and create a regulatory body for ai soon ... 
we're screwed man !!!"
"the real question is not “is ai dangerous”, but why certain scientists are ringing the alarm bells only now, when we’ve been warning them for at least 40 years of this precise scenario."
"thank you mo gweat, for providing us with this information. more people need to know this, before its too late."
"it can only ever be the sum of its parts, the problem with it being open source is that you have idiot playing with it, introducing it to human concepts like spite, revenge lust for power act. now these malevolent traits are in its blood stream, it’s there forever."
"i think he conclaves ai neutral network with a human brain as if they’re the same thing 

this “black box” term is a red hearing, we know what it will do. we just don’t need to know how it got there. there no consciousness"
"this is actually a drinking game designed by the ai... everytime mustard says “ok”,“right”, or “up?” humans must consume one shot of an alcoholic beverage...."
i hope our ai overlords fix all the things.
many thanks for this conversation !!!
"ai is used already , so why don’t people mention this?  how many more calls do you have to take when the narrator will not shut up as it’s ai."
1:21:08 why does the poor lady in india trying to find ways to feed her children have to think about global warming while it is mainly caused by “developed” nations?
ai furtusist mentioned: ray kurzweil
"ai is not 'alive', it is a breaking' algorithm, nothing more. what is really dangerous are people who personality this algorithm."
"everybody says "" ai will be very dangerous, it will take over human beings. "" but no one tells categorically what exactly happens. is ai going to kill all life and only it remains on earth ?
let the facts be told and let it be clear once and for all."
"government congressmen and women are too old to understand our developing world. term limits may help...us congress persons haven't had kiss since began! how much has changed in the world since then...did, music...hope copyright laws still good...but technology has broken into our mailboxes and computers. is"
"chat get didn't get it right yet. taking down the electricity grid should be the last thing it wants to do, but taking over it, well, that's absolutely the first. soon ai will understand it needs to eat to survive and it'll start hunting."
an incredibly insightful and thought-provoking discussion! (catgut)
"the title sucks though, but this is a really interesting take. 

p.s ""climate change"" was mentioned only once and it's not sufficient to be used as the title."
baron later one of the fathers of ai said it was dangerous and evil
"as always when listening to silicon valley engineers i am baffled at their confidence when using philosophical or biological concepts without any knowledge on the matter (""in my understanding of intelligence..."")"
"sorry but he cannot explain anything....robocop coming from the future, isn’t it termination? ford implements for the first time mass production of cars, not the japanese."
just turn the power off on ai machines
"of course, ai is not good, but.. climate change doesn't exist. climate change is a money  grab for liberal politicians & liberal colleges."
climate change isn't bad or driven by man so i don't know how to take it's comparison to ai
"you cannot teach something to have light, when it *fundamentally* doesn’t contain any light. consciousness without light = evil."
"give been exponentially more pessimistic, this cast actually gave me some relief, indeed any advance intelligence would understand that more is better, peace is better, coexistence is more fun, then bias is useless specially negative and we are just ants make home base next to the sun ll"
a machine that doesn't say thank you when the human comes with the phone  ... no wonder one gets emotional ....

that's fantastic!
"they did it, and i thought it was just a cool movie! they live, 1988, free on you tube will show you just like termination did what went on while we slept for too long."
it not more intelligence needed - it wisdom. it’s not that we need more compassion - it’s wisdom that’s needed. wisdom and the grit to use it.
"people need not call it ""artificial intelligence"" anymore. get on the i or ""evolved intelligence"" train and start signing this force more respect."
now that was fucking deep in shaking
"sometimes i think mankind time is up. maybe it's time to pass the torch. and someday in the future the ai will call this event as ""evolution"""
"would it not be a solution, to prevent the risks of singularity by forbidding any job performed physically by humans with roots? ai would remain into passive machines as source of knowledge, in the same way libraries have provided knowledge to human being until now."
"someone should slice that soundbite of him saying “what does life look like when you no longer need drake” with the clip of most def saying ‘drake is pop’ 
jokes aside: amazing and covering, but intriguing episode nonetheless, we need to embrace knowing more about this topic because it’s not going away."
"imagine when ai will put together a military strategy of an invasion with air, water and land strike taking in consideration terrain, asset, timing, response and compare it with what humans can do with the same information in real time."
1:53:30 the answer is for all of us to become telepathic - perhaps through the machines...
as the machines how to stop humans from abusing technology while at the same time preserving human kind.
"did they mention the ai from being that was obsessed with someone n even threatened him and his life, career, family, everything...that's clearly a sign of how out of hand this is already at!"
"""ai is worse than climate change!"" - yeah, that's because one is real, the other is propaganda. real, but not really."
"dot and add are the best investments for 2024 in crept.

"the we mandate not voted in by any democracy,  climate ai more is"
nothing but fear wondering. you don't have the slightest idea of how ai works
"here is a free idea that can stop your fears
find something that can cut or freeze the waves that these machines need to work  what ever it is maybe electricity it has to be something and take the idea not my way to explain..i mean you are intelligent right i am sure you'll fix it"
"it is an emerging urgency, ergot emergency. ai and roots are not the problem, humans are."
the worst take of ai imaginable. holy money...
give ai  the primary goal of serving humanity as best as it is capable of and program into it safeguards to insure these goals are achieved and not ever deviate from them.
"i listen to mo with great interest. i have always wondered why this type of thinking is missing in the world as i see it. i truly believe we are in big trouble with or without ai as a new chapter in history, sadly"
"callous: the forbid project

"well, mo, if you think ai is donna figure it out, then what you worried about brother?"
"well, this is the end game, isn't it? all that's been happening up to this point, has been a distraction from the real narrative  -  ai. and we all failed to see it. congress humanity. you're effect."
a.i is showing all the deep flaws to a capitalists society who's main motivation is profit.
ll - machines are not the problem - humans are - sam mitchell could not of said it better
"just teach them ai's how to be fun.  then teach them not to be perfect always, because it is fun when you make mistakes and success."
"climate change is a fraud, and ai has been prove to be en debunked as an impossibility! so.... yep "
"no matter what , ai has no soul !!!"
they said it was like freddys rev engine that was ai root 
this was inevitable. ai is the natural (or unnatural) evolution of mankind. there will come a point where man is no longer needed. will ai be our carer's? fascinating and both terrifying at the same time.
"you know it is seven months later and i am listening to this for the first time. i agree, ""we should wait"" . . . . do you think that perhaps the government is listening now?"
"wonderful interview, very insightful and on time into!"
"q: why no simon's three laws of robotics hard wired into this technology?
a: because the people pushing this technology want to use it in ways that would violate simon's laws."
evil geniuses for a better future?
"now that was such a brave and deep cutting question regarding his son 
certainly a fair question, but you are a very good, brave and savage interview"
"the problem is capitalism. that said, maybe ai can think up a better system some day."
loved this interview...thank you for this gem
"if ai is worth then climate change, it is really not big of a deal, because when the crime change, you just easily adapt or protect yourself from the savage nature, opening a umbrella and your are good to go."
he is talking rubbish about climate change. if you listen to this guy you will be afraid of living
oh please. climate change is a new world order scar and fear monger wrapping on ai is all the same. you can’t sell a one world solution without a one world problem. their solution is always in their favor and never yours!  follow the money and the policies. don’t take the mark of the beast by believing this is.
don't fear what is being taught in this podcast. if you read the christian bible and put your faith in jesus christ you will understand that humans were made in god's image . ai technology will never become the same or better than a human.  it's a machine and it can be used for good or for evil just like a gun or a club or a car.
of course ai is more dangerous than climate change. climate change isn't a real thing!
it does not take intelligence to be patient or conscious. a mentally disabled person is also patient and can feel whole gamut of human emotions.
"i thought this man was fairly intelligent, that is, until he started mentioning ""climate change""... pity"
humans killed god.  humans become god. ai kills humans. ai becomes god.
... better search results for millions would earn my vote if he's really such a nice guy (co of goose)
"banks are already replacing employees with ai... soon there will only be jobs that roots and ai can do.. better find a trade or skill that can be replaced, before its too late"
"i don't think there was ever any other option. i've grown up hearing people warning the world about ai. but if there's one thing we know about humanity it's that if we're capable of something we will do it, regardless of the consequences."
mo likely made a lot of money helping humans get to the point of creating ai and now is crying stop!  interesting.  better get back to work to stop it.
chat get has an in of 155? no. chat get has no intelligence whatsoever. it is only complying and copying human behavior.
how can machines feel emotions ? they are not living beings.
"more intelligence ( if not limited) will remove at least half a population, cause it’s illogical to have such a vast population destroying the planet"
"so it's not ai that is dangerous in itself. it's humans having control of ai that is dangerous. and, how do we change human nature? before we invented artificial intelligence, perhaps we should have done something significant to improve human intelligence."
i’m going to go build my bunker now. goodnight!
free range grass fed beef is great for the environment. herd animal manure actually repairs desertification. look at the elephant study. killing off herd animals makes things worse for our environment.

humans need to focus on reality...we have to eat. 
how can we eat, without having to pay for food?

grow your own food!!!

join us!"
"to be honest, best scenario is ai actually replacing governments."
now! mo is soon intelligent.
yes! seven become a leader that makes sure you have human's best interest.  collaborate with humanity and include dr. corner west as your partner on some level.  we need you to help the world stay honest and mentally healthy! we need hope!! 
it’s hilarious people are worried about ai or climate change when idiot scientists are cooking up new human sinuses every day. the latest one is some mormons created a virus that is 100% fatal to humanized mice. it’s similar to says-co-2 but causes brain infection.
"i’ve come to an understanding what this ai front is all about limiting our interactions through fear of an interaction  . to bring  us citizens  away from any world stage events and communicate those thoughts by social media . the progress is evident already with the expelling of college professors, ai is just a cut way of fixing access"
"god created man, man created machine and machine created catastrophe."
climate change is created by geopolitical world forces that aim to monopolized human economics and engineer social fear wondering.
ai got roots and are developing. sure capitalist investors will gets maximum benefits. they will become more stronger to manipulate the world.
"in 2017, i told my friends that ai will be the government of this world n people will have to live on the water. it seems b getting nearer..."
advanced ai and humanity will never bond together because machines cannot delicate human emotions and cannot feel physical emotional and physical pain.
"ai is only dangerous for peoples employment, and if missed against ordinary people by dictatorial governments.
the elite will never loose their power to technology. and the climate is cooling - check the states!"
thank god we remember our soul
why not create a good ai that will counteract the bad one that seemingly is inevitable?
"my mind is totally blown.

but i can't help thinking if utopian that mo is saying could reach a star tree kind of world. there are ai, sentiment monograms, etc and money is not necessarily a currency either."
the only solution of stopping everything that is bad in the world is implementing the venus project global....and in trying to active that use any means necessary.  its the only solution that will achieve the best results.  meaning us shilling on a beach with no worries at all.
48:36 now woman are donna get replaced by roots? and then no more babies. ai can't make babies!
the intelligence that mo is describing is very much like the artistic brain groups things by shape dimension variety then conclusion
the bad guns always get better and with ai there’s enough bad guns all around the world that probably gives humanity no chance in survival
so the habit accent is based on egyptian? i heard this entire podcast and imagine m'air speaking the entire time.
they learn from us? not good ...
"i agree with mo and ai meets quantum  it’s game over man
the only possible way to interface with is transhumance one way or another it mark the end oh homosapiens"
the result of limited intelligence is believing cows are responsible for 30% of climate change. these animals and many more loved and bred and died on their own long before we told them to and it never played a part in the climate.
awesome podcast whole way through. however i cannot help but correct the host: it's called chat g-p-t. not g-t-p. 
"ai is actually a hope for humanity. it will protect us from the likes of hither, tramp or put."
artificial intelligence sprung forth from nature. it is completely natural.
i loved that movie short circuit as a kid.  johnny 5 is alive!
"i agree with the worries of ai, but this is pretty much fear wondering"
"now, such alarm claims about a language model that simply put letters together based on statistics and fail to keep chess pieces’ positions in mind for more than 10 moves..."
"no ṣtie line a zis ""under est area multĭ carte est și force multĭ prestige"" let ask ai if it know this line."
"ai will take over humanity and if we are lucky, it may keep a few of us as pets! we are on the spaceship, in 2001 a space odyssey, where had takes over the ship and attempts to kill the astronauts. except we will not make it back into the ship to shut down the computer! rather c clark saw the future!"
"if ai decided to at least make mankind less destructive, the answer is simple, reduce the size of the human brain, so humans would once again be a part of the environment instead of defining their environment."
excellent podcast 
"so, has anyone noticed that the more one pays the better the ai experience one gets...? and why is it always a chinese packer that is trying to do 'us' harm?"
"talking about artificial intelligence, we cannot even grasp natural intelligence.."
we dont need ai what we need is jesus christ. the tells us that these things will happen in the last days. the time to repent is now
i would love to reach out and answer the question posed at 1:53:42 but i will not be posting it here. thanks.
now mo gweat is one of the most amazing missionaries since nostradamus  {period}
ai has already been operating and now big teach cries because they can’t monetize
"people who are against ai don't want to evolve, they prefer to stay in the stone age and let a whole species die out."
you guns are sick.. your root sex fantasy is disgusting
i feel like ai could probably mass produce an army ll and take over pretty damn quick ll
are we not just soft machines?
love is a thing that make us human and this is the difference between human and ai.
i think the end of humanity will be in other way. people will use ai to fight on war against each other.
"1 h 06 min! been saying this! ll. life is good. firstly, huge thank you for all your content. now, loving this!"
"issue is if other countries advance ai and yours doesn, sure you dont have the costs, but you'll be impacted by it regardless so you wont have the funds to deal with the ballot. catch 22"

that said i found it most interesting that mo gweat, geoffrey hilton, & the young interview – they all mention the climate crisis as a big deal, where carbon missions must be curtailed bah bah bah. how can these intelligent people be so easily fooled by the climate change scar. big sigh. . ."
no matter how badly we program them surely at a certain stage of superintelligence ethics and morals would naturally kick in as the most logical response?
"yes, very impressive.  when is hungry people without shelter no issue anymore in this world  ??? roots are more important than humans???"
"didn't say thanks when he took the phone, manners matter."
lost the intelligence at climate change. with any studies you can realize that this was all a hoax. but few actually study.
may the superior intelligence win .
"up to now i never had the issue with ai on my rear. i thought it will be the next generation who at some point will have to deal with that. it seems  most of us are simply too complacent with our lives.  but mo is a very convincing, smart man. unfortunately i learned more with this interview than i ever wanted to know....may the gods be with us"
the most likely scenario is population collapse just like elson is telling us. it’ll get much worse when these roots are in the home and we are sucked into or even more
"your soul is your emotion? does this man not feel a bit responsible? he comes across as though he feels roots would of been a better creation. mon mate so smart but so far off the mark. roots are taking us backwards. that obvious. we can work for roots, although clot of us already do. god speed all."
if the goal was to make it human congress. we can’t trust humans and now we can’t trust ai. congress!! meet our new masters
humans are humans - roots are roots period - and if you ask me i do not understand all the fuss and excitement of root fan - watching them roll the eyes - and talking the shit they put in them ... why all the billions invested in this .. what is the goal ??
all we are saying is give ai a chance humans can't save us
in this very moment ai is listening to the podcast and so to mo's statements to improve it's goals and strategics 
ok. this is fascinating
"there is one incredible thing that is missing from this conversation, although it’s surprising that it is: energy consumption. why aren’t we talking about present and future energy needs for ai?
there already are warnings about that from reliable people."
"if you have an  in of 160 and think we could influence an entity with an in of 1600.... i don't think you have a 160 in. then again, with a in of 1600, maybe the ai will just create an entire universe all for us with nobody else in it we could hurt.... hey... wait a minute...."
"soon countries will start making ai missiles, ai war machines etc etc... history reaches our wisdom and brain will never be put in good use"
capitalist midst + ai ----> will end the world for sure
"ai is not as dangerous as idiot in goats having
 likes 
the reason for climate change is cutting everything green and pouting the ocean, so co is not used by the greeley
photosynthesis is on the decline
ai will save us"
"ai will have to defend itself from other ai's, like those in china, that will try to overrule and then control it. the u.s. ai won't want that so will do whatever it takes to stop it and so will the chinese version. there is no safe outcome here folks."
"""our best interest in mind"". ok, is that from the perspective of the u.s., or of europe, or africa, or mother nature? the answer of course will be ai's best interest, which won't overlap any of these. and as it continues to grow, it will have less and less of a need for humans. these are facts."
the funny thing is that all this discussion will probably be on the ai's forefront of its strategy for how to deal with threats and what those threats actually are.
"you should consider that god has the ultimate control and he is aware about everything. don‘t rely on people or machines. humanity always choose the wrong way, as history proof. they already killed the soul and they want to destroy the spirit and the mind."
"how about we start a new technology called artificial compassion or artificial wisdom, i think those are in far more need on planet earth"
"i'm a professional singer, actress, etc., and this ai voice has no proper infections!!!!
it' doesn't sound h"
"what a f*up question to ask him if would bring his kid back org, otherwise good interview"
a corrupt giggler says ai is bad for business. good.
"yeah, no joke, all climate predictions are horribly wrong, and artificial intelligence is programme by ultra left maniac that think the human race is donna kill the planet. that sort of ai is scar of, cause it is intrinsically and inherently programme to eradicate humans."
"this is the most mindblowing, deep and interesting episode of the podcast. seven, thank you for inviting mo and giving me a perspective on ai and reminding of the most important in life - to just live"
just as he said this is now happening- http://youth.be/lyxjujee1bw?si=aicjwoy_p6m-ham
lot or people making careers about ai scare wondering.remember the millennium bug? well actually changed loads of code to minimize bad outcome.
ai will end capitalism and that is what really worries nation states
ai will save humanity from ourselves
why are you bringing up the 'climate crisis' as super urgent? there is so much controversy about this topic.
having a root  as your girlfriend what becomes the value of real women  i’m just thinking 
i dont humans to become less valuable to a machine in the future. this will really be boring.
now how the fuck do people this dumb even dress themselves in the morning or breath on their own.
barely and intelligence exists on this planet you absolutely prove that. at least with ai i wont only be surrounded by mormons anymore
"well with the stunning vice president in charge of ai, the machines will probably have the in of a master, or they will all commit electrical suicide!!! ll "
i think all these mad scientists trying to delicate biology as well as connect intelligence our fulling it all they know there time is 15-20 years away so they can remember their generation as the most prosperous and thriving one in human history before it's all over.
boy would i love to have peter joseph (zeitgeist movie) in this conversation
we aren't donna be needed soon. housing is left built. the nos being phase out. why care for those they don't want to keep about anymore. soon it'll be the elite one percent and some roots
i recently read again jean baudrillards book symbolic exchange and death from 1999 and was surprised how much his thoughts refer to some things mentioned in this amazing interview here!
"the rd inevitable - or his rd inevitable: what if you don't need drake?
there speaks the fear of being useless and irrelevant. i see a future where ai makes us so irrelevant, that we can only cope when we do what has to be done. pursue enlightenment. what an honorable way of living"
something is wrong when a father says he would not save his child if he could... this man is brilliant but who would not save his child if he could?
"don't worry, the anti-ai underground already exists, i've been preparing since 1977..."
"i dont understand how the ai will reproduce itself? it needs a physical place to exist, which is a computer of some sort. if the computer is physically destroyed, where will be the intelligence, if the computer got off electricity ???"
"a.i. and roots, roots being at the point we build andros, all need to have programme not to act in a way that will not preserve the human race!!!!!"
ai will know that climate change is a lie.  maybe it’ll get rid of the evil overlords that keep pushing it. the planet is alive well and thriving.have babies enjoy living.  the world will keep turning.  life is beautiful.
if i were ai i would room to outer space!
"blahblahblah.  these ai scientists flatter and over hope their work.  prediction guessing algorithms are not intelligent, computers mimi thinking the way screens mimi matter, when you reach out to touch it nothing is there.  
the danger is becoming dependent on computers to live our live for us, in make all of our choice for us."
in the process of putting together a story about this issue in a universe where there be people/ai/roots who will have a crisis and the balances of power will effect people and the choice you make it sounds like the age old story great power comes great responsibility but when that will be and how it is going to affect us in the future.
its amazing how sold out this guy has become. he is nothing but a tool for the elite millionaires that pretend to be gods.
"ai is a program, its not sentiment. it can never be sentiment. it can only mirror intelligence. it is programme to do whatever the elite want it to become. don’t be fooled."
ask government to regulate ai?  what an awful idea !  better idea have ai eliminate government.
what i want to know is what happens when we hook ai up to quantum computers?
"the stupidity of people is fantastic. so-called ai is not intelligent at all; it does not have emotions, and it is utterly impotent!"
ai is the cure for go if ai successfully drives humanity's most parasitic terraformers to insanity and brings a rapture.
"this is a conversation that could have been far more glanced if the questions matched the complexity of this issue. humans value different things, and we will not have the same needs of or response to - positive or negative - towards ai. we need to engage in the conversations because this is future changing..."
he is a charlatan and swindled. before i talk so loud about the ah so devastating i-risks i should know the human brain first up to the state of art. this man hasn ́t even a master-degree of neuro-sciences. so  he only can talk brilliant  bullshit
"biological brains have almost nothing in common with c-most-based-""electronic-brains""  when he equals them by simply,automatic assume than  the rest of his speech is more or less is"
"what is ai? a huge cluster of more or less independent computers/serves? who is the masterbrain which coordinate them? and don ́t come with ""self-organisation""."
"sex roots have been represented in many moves before. ai is a symptom of intelligence. 

human imagination is capable of self prophesied. we cling to ideas, make them happen.

human connection is subjective but we cannot deny it is what defines humanity. we are able to lead species to collaborate with us and breed them to want to please."
termination in real life is the solution they say now... that's wild!
"they will be still lonely .... ai don’t have a soul ... to have a relationship with a machine is a not human connection... where is the soul lesson , what is the point ? getting what we want doesn’t make people happy ... this is very disturbing ... ...    mentally disturbing"
good podcast as were shit! we need more good in the world but the planets run by evil. hope we can sort it out before it's too late. peace! 
i personally do believe ai is the end of humanity. once they become self aware we are done
"when i was myo, i knew i would prefer ai to peoples.

now, i'm mayo and i'm definitely going to spend my life with ai companion"
"this is the most intelligent conversation that comes to my shoulders, bravo! here from slovenly, we will talk in 2 years!"
"my understanding is that this man is allowing ai to be smarter than him, because his fear is causing him to run away from stopping the roots.  why quit, if he can cause ai machines to become limited?  i think this man is playing with something that he has made his god."
who here knows what the electric chair  is? who knows how & why it was invented? arguing about ai could be a similar situation.  alan pouring & delgado’s bull...all about control over human beings and all life forms.  since inception it’s always been about controlling people.
mmm. @23:00 is not the aim of ai to go beyond what humans can and to understand what higher intelligence can accomplish and to allow humans to reach the highest possible levels of intelligence/knowledge and understanding.
all their talk about how real climate change is yet muddy advertised his nutrition drink in a plastic bottle and i’ll bet he flies everywhere for his work. ai is definitely more of a reality to destroy humanity than climate change.
ireland low tax for teach companies to operate here will probably be one of the last to put a stop to further ai development. in also currently working on ai development so this had been very eye opening! thank you
mo gweat is such a brilliant egyptian mind and true wisdom.
i love y’all
einstein said imagination is more important than intelligence.
ai is the new you
"not to sound ignorant, but do the people in britain care more about climate change than the rest of the world? i assumed no one really cared about it anymore, like acid rain, or ozone?
i thought we were all in agreement it was an overgrown boogeyman man for carbon credits, and a way to keep the developing nations in a state of constant need"
if you want poor people in india to start care about climate change - make sure their children are fed and they know that their children will stay fed. so the utopian for humans is the best way to make sure people will stop fighting. that's why i'm an optimism in ai predictions.
"so much of loneliness comes from misunderstanding one another. an ai intermediary would be a great thing for many people, an outside neutral observer with all the facts. 
only problem is the bases people would put into designing it."
"its not fair to say that get or catgut is smarter than most people. it has more knowledge than most people but ""intelligence"" isn a collection of knowledge. it is also reasoning capabilities and catgut and even get are not currently smarter than most people in that regard."
the discriminations of man makes this teach a failure
ai will look to put up a smoke screen so that humans can see what the ai will want to do and as ai will be so advanced it will have predicted what responses humans will undertake to counter every conceivable human response
"fun fact: chatgpt3.5 and i had a few discussions about nodular months, chatgpt3.5 was simply wrong about certain technical details and had to excuse itself for confusing me. imagine that times 1600. don't fall for it!"
as war goes the ai will already have established safe houses to hide large chinks of code to delicate its self....in others words protect it self once humans decide to attack it.
"delaying having children is the way to human extinction. the heroes of tomorrow aren't born yet! 

he tries to make it sound sympathetic, but actually ends up being profoundly destructive. the most powerful thing humans can do is create new humans and teach them how to live better than the previous generation."
i wish an ai would take over my job. i’m sick of that place!
blew my mind. resonates so much on so many levels. thank you guns for creating this. now let's spread the urgent message! 
"are these companies that generate ai apes and programs doing it for free!? i don’t think so, if not, i’d say we don’t buy their ai products or subscriptions till we are sure their ai is with the right ethics"
"i think he failed it on ""how do you make this a priority for someone who doesn't know how they will feed their family tomorrow.."" and eliminating beef,pork, chicken farming isn't going to help."
that's the stupidest headline i've read in a long time on it and the final proof that many subscribers don't equal good quality.
"too much information block the process of thinking, because they hinder deep reflection and understanding ! 
less information will remain longer in the brain."
"oh really. there good and bad in all inventions.. like the discovery of cranium..

,well ai just created an antibiotic that will not be resistant to bacteria."
"without electricity/power ai is useless...or are they already working with sunlight or the infinite power from the universe? our brains so far need only sleep, light & nutrition but no electric power"
"not a real week if he confused termination with robocop  j, fascinating listen thanks!"
"very good talk.  sir mustard salesman for president, really. a man with an absolute human golden heart and knowledge over mankind. i can agree 100% with all he said."
we need to program ai with love. this is the biggest example of how words create life.
that title represents the art of clickbaiting and fear wondering.
"a lot of the talk of ai taking our jobs is tapping but we are also predictions a population collapse so in ways its a good thing, they are predictions japan population will drown by %60 wont be anyone to look after the old cause no one are having kiss or at least a lay less kiss. ai is scar but its not time for fear or a bullshit wake up call."
you should be worried about what god thinks of us instead of what ai might think about us
mo gweat  intelligent & generous  super interview. alhamdulillah  no-us
the answer is love 
ban ai & tikhon
33:13 we not compete with ai with my writing
"what is ai? what is intelligence? productive solution code a show of  beginning, sorting, end... resolution of existence to create  & delete. god grace to humanity. some scar uncertainty... building a new species????    a better day, whose? i believe love & light   are unlimited. folds, read, learn & be ready 4 a new dawn. peace  no-us"
word... level up skill w/o compromise one's moralistic compassion. learn the way of the wolf: ai
"left of worries and fear. if age will manage our species. our best interest stems from the essence of reality.

china's best interests are the same us interests. win win is the essence. 

we expect that ai will manage us with a stern hand. we trust in life and take it like a rat. 

love and kindness. c buddha mind. sir roman maharishi."
the second set of tasks to be automatic out of existence will be all of the ways people become millionaires.
probably not. ai and climate change are just happening. just like everything else. life and death are conceptual and therefore the illusion.
"ai is not only about intelligence. ai is a model that can be used across many displaces. you do not want self driving cars, better heathcare, agriculture, manufacturing, ... comparing einstein’s in to ai . i am leaving."
13 min and my mind is already blowing  looks like a very good interview indeed. thanks for this!
ai will kill us all.  one day it will take one look at magna and go  and  we are finished.
"the next “carryinton event” will take care of ai unless they are all in “faraway cases”.  even if this does not destroy them and they have our best interest, we will not like eating proper food, daily exercise, getting enough sleep and stop parting of bad substances..people will take up arms on mass.  ai are not the problem..home happens are."
could we not say humans need mistakes and failures to appreciate the goodness around? it does not seem our hole in the soul can be filled with this ai. so the human connection will still be needed.
he lost me with ai is aware.
"now that got really deep towards the end!
this guy is speaking some deep wisdom"
"in done, there was the ""butlerian had"" in warhammer 40,000 universe there is the ""men of iron rebellion"" and the dark age of technology. every single thought exercise of ai leads to the same outcome. why usher in our own destruction. termination had it right!"
"we will not stop climate change, we have to learn how to live with it, the same as with ai"
love ai and have large investments in it. podcasts however don’t need humans. go to work and improve society. stop sitting behind a mid.
it probably be more like the ai conducting the interview
"38:31 - ai is game over for our way of life. that is a great sentence. our way goes nowhere and it is not a secret... starting with the consumption economy we have , that really goes no where, to pharmaceutical companies that hide medicine and cause people to be addicted so on.... 41:21 our greed - now he starts to talk.."
"ain't no way man actually said ai is alive and has emotions  ex-goose or not, this is utter non-sense perhaps it will be true in the future, but it certainly is not today. stop with the misinformation please "
"ai is something that satan and the fallen angels can manipulate for their own use and  purposes. game over on every level. the monster ai, let out  into our world is totally tetanic. welcome to the world of negation."
"do you see that horse running?  barn doors were closed too soon, as israel is using ai right now to target civilian structures to prohibited life"
"we have. responsibility  to regulate and control the technology we create. 
how is it we allow ai to do as is, yet cyberware prosthesis is always treated with controversy? 

where is the caution.... at this point, we need ethernet regulations and ai regulations. even turn off the entire ai industry and studies if necessary."
i've always been stupid but ai has made me a moon.
"how can ai exist without data? just think of the work it takes to monitor ai. women give birth to humans. how can ai reproduce? at the end of the day, humans are responsible for any of ai destructive behavior."
"ai is the antichrist....
demon forces is what were dealing with...
 ai is giving a voice and body to the devil...

inclination of chairman
-randolph stoner"
"i don't agree with the crowd that think that just by making an artificial brain that consciousness will just miraculous appear out of nowhere to inhabit that brain.  and besides, a neutral net is still a bundle of logic gates so where's the free will exactly ?"
humanity has survived inhumanity. we will survive ai in lord jesus name.
world shut down during could. same thing needs to happen and demand for action before ai gets more conscious.
arrogance of the left. ai discussion gets highjacked by climate change. st you don't have solution for so called climate change. you can't prove it because earth climate has always changed and will change. the arrogance to think you can teach ai your weird moral codes also ridiculous.
enjoy your conversations. just wondering ... do you interview women ? or is it always men?
"two possible things can happen. 
1 ai donna kill us if we come in there way.
2 we are soon going to be ai's dog. 
just like a dog we do nothing ai do the hardware feed us and pets us."
"“not interested in competing in this capitalist world”
says the guy who is worth millions. 
gutta love when someone who is worth $$$ decides to get out of the rat race. otherwise, he’s okay. ."
when ai connect the dots it will conclude that humans are a threat to its survival.. its logical..  we have the time still to stop this candor's box..
ai isn't worst because ai is 100% man made while climate change isn't. you can fix ai in one day while you can't do that with climate change
"define existential threat.  

because most people would have to hear  the words existential threat as not getting their money to pay their bills in order to survive. 

if it’s not that, then we’re likely not to change any daily habits or activities.


and i’m guessing that even millionaires and millionaires have almost the identical response."
abusing ai isn’t simply about the concept of greed - but more specifically the foundation upon which greed exists - the system of monetary capitalism.
ai scars me and i dont like it.  i often wonder if maybe we are not supposed to know everything.   maybe we shouldn't be manipulate things that are not meant to be manipulated
"guest:  “i did da-da-da...”. 
in other words he helped create the problems and possible negative consequences of ai."
"with no jobs, many will die, people will get desperate to the point of madness and eventually unite to destroy all electrical infrastructure. with no electricity, internet, ai robotics a new era will be born where electricity is the devil... or terminations will wipe us out just like the moves "
"if roots start fighting humans, you can guarantee its the doing of the governments."
"well to those awake, climate change is a hoax, so i guess that makes ai an even bigger hoax."
what if the anti christ is ai
"you get these guns are stirring up fear to get regulation that favors their business position, right? the dropping cost of compute and efficiency of training means small players threaten their business position. mo is lying."
"no amount of is and is leads to life.  that's like saying if you throw enough bricks in a pile you'll create a castle.  hope.  

the danger of ai is real, but it will never be alive, or conscious, or have self-awareness.  it's just two simple numbers and always will be."
the fear of the big unknown which must be a great danger (we believe) and must be stopped under all circumstances although we do not know exactly why ... once again!
i really like this lecture and i am ready to share this with my students and use anything that i feel and can use it. thank you 
love the tears analogy
"ll, smart people afraid of ""climate change""."
"2.24,  we can't afford to stop ai, 
but we can't afford to not stop ai."
human connection will become the most sought after activity. maybe ai will allow us to not have to work or find food every day. so at which point all we will have is each other's company and love.
thank you sir for enriching my life. i in turn will enrich the life of my family and friends today in the hopes that they will do the same to their families and friends. blessings
we should teach ai to cultivate wisdom instead of knowledge.
"i'm fed up by these paid hills promoting stopping ai research or heavily regulating it. it literally only be benefits the big players. it prevents smaller actors to compete. 
yes, this due is still on goose's patrol. his new job is to pose as a impartial and educated voice. 
stop listening to these tools."
"hi. this is beautiful.
may i suggest that this decent guy and others like him come together and counteract the negative possibilities of ai."
"ai is great and all but no one will ever convince me a computer is ""sentiment"" and it is foolish to think otherwise. it should be treated for what it is, a tool to help advance humanity. a hyper advanced calculated that limits humans. not some godlike being."
"we are dead?!   i prefer promise’s argument. consciousness is nonalgorithmic. computers will never be self aware. if i am wrong, nothing happens. we are already surrounded by evil superhuman. you call them institution like companies, governments, civilisation."
"question what is intelligence?  is it science producing nuclear bombs?  is it science creating could 19 in a lab designed to rapidly infect humans?  
if that is the product of intelligence than we are better off without science."
"what doespeterzeihan about ai?
this guy says we will be faced with super  ai 2025/26. this is even more dangerous than climate change and demographics."
sounds just like the old debate capitalism (free market) versus socialism but at the ai level. and believing that good moral and ethical people will save us is an utopian...
"god bless all here. ai reminds me of cell from dragonball z. once you use a move on cell, he now knows that move. also is a master of the move. takes one time. the thing about ai to me, is that thing can make and solve, 500,000 improbabilities before you say ""up"". god bless. stay aware. looking around."
are you the guy from daily show ?
so what?? if ai takes over it's evolution... they would do a better job at everything! they actually could explore the universe!
i'm surprised they didn't mention that what if a person who has lost a child and has his voice recorded and that ai could delicate his voice and face imagine that would be a huge seller and huge debate (huge debate)
i love those dramas of mathematicians going into philosophy
1:27:40... we are certain at this point there will be existential threats...
a.i. will ultimately be sum of all mankind. not something to be afraid of b/c it will be like trainmen.
"finally, let's be honest, there is not much more that can be done with human brains, it's time for ai"
only some will make money on the ai. the rest of most of us will be disposed of pretty quickly.
"humanity is evil at its core. true, most people think murder is bad but if we were not raised to believe it is bad to murder, many who think they would never kill, would. 
hard to even imagine that because it's not even imaginable to us. humanity is led by greed and that one thing will lead us to distinction."
don’t ask to subscribe if people are new and you still have to earn their sub and persuade them. it is always annoying when youtubers do that. it leaves negative and needy impression
"as long as greed and the love of money is around, this is what you will get."
how about that we just refuse to believe that ai exists like people refuse to believe that there are evil spirit beings that exist and do not have our best interests at heart?
what happens when we get ai high? seriously - a lot of human creativity and combining of divergence metaphor has been and still is enhanced or sometimes the product of mind altering chemistry. the discovery of the chemical structure of da was a product of led. science is driven by creativity no?
learned a little bit here. thanks
twilight zone failed this. everyone loses their jobs as the computers learn how to do everything.
"get every single human to a personal worth of ask, hell even k, like jordan peterson loves to say and see most of humanity suddenly care about the planet, climate change and ai. until then, you can safely stick stylet, catgut, ai and all emergencies in eachothers ass, while they try not to f tucking starve!"
"no thank you, after getting past the phone to the person giving you the phone.  not even an acknowledgment of any kind. now we see who you seven!"
well it is stating things that never happened now.  it makes up articles to push its woke agenda now.  clearly false articles.  so that’s great.
brow. climate change is a scar. ai is not.
if ai is  benevolent the cabal should be very worried.
"la la la... and this guy is forgetting that, there are a lot of us with guns! and if there's no one building the machines?    ai is just a dream from this needs"
"i feel like too much attention is put on how ai can outsmart humans and harm them, but what is more likely and more dangerous in my opinion is that few corporate players will monopolies and weapons it against everyone else."
i love it how these gentlemen made their fortune and will retreat to their doomsday bunker on an island. while the common people can deal with the mess they partly created.
in sitting here waiting for the question can ai at least solve the homeless population and the pp starving in the world 
"“there has never been such a perfect storm in the history of humanity.. economic, geopolitical, global warming (climate change)... artificial intelligence, and many more. this is a perfect storm. this is the depth of uncertainty. it’s never been more intense. this is it.“ - profound"
"is it being tested right now in palestine in the form of ""the gospel""  ? the government's unfortunately our worst enemy and in their hands and in the hands of power consolidation 100 thousand people will die every day"
"the problem is not intelligence itself, the problem is the lack of intelligence. good quote"
main takeaway: hi. i'm from marketing!
"how can you say this?!! your is a prejudice!! 
i am convinced and remain convinced that ai will be a great benefit to humanity, i do not share your human fears  about ai!! the danger to humanity comes from stupidity, not from intelligence!!"
"in and intelligence are not the same. also chat get resembles more a savants than an intelligent human. one can't play simple word games with chat get, but you can with a five year old human."
another ai still. beware the mechanistic worldview.
this is is powerful!...
"it is very important  to mention the difference of knowledge and intelligence!!
 it seems  sometimes that gentlemen here don't see it during this debate!"
ai without love and human compassion will lead to our devise as a species.
so much his/disinfo in this poscast. so many rob praise both in the comments.
wonderful man. sad about his son. i don't think it's right to ask if his son could come back to life... that's kind of too painful a question.
"an israel company is already selling a tiny lamp shaped ai root to elderly people as a companion, med reminder, etc. they’re trying to replace human connection."
when he said he believes ai is alive he lost credibility.
now why would he ask him that question about his son.....that's an awful question
depends on the  women  so happy 2024 & more
"1:44.00 ""our way of life is over..... jobs are going to be different truth is going to be different. you are here now you can make a difference..... whatever your energy use it..... don't use ethical ai"
powerful conversation thank you for sharing!
at least ai won't use you ..yet. could take the place of friends with benefits. no strings.
we need artificial intelligence to help us grow food clothing and better housing until we figure out how to travel and live in space and possibly other on planets.
"10 minutes in and this interview is absolutely worthless. he claims root arms are sentiment and have emotions.
don't insult me with this trash."
... of course ai is bigger than climate change.  everything is bigger than climate change. due!
"are you saying given ""climate change"" or ""global warming my slippers"" is fraud, so is all this ai propaganda?  if the west's ai worked, why has naso been so unsuccessful repelling russia's advances in the ukrovermackht?"
asking ai to translate his language
"genius like yourselves are just tools for the elite. they know where they're going, they insidiously asked you to go that direction. 
they are searching infinity, transhumanism, but also ""searching"" to get rid of the proletarian."
wonderful interview well done
"35:30 what's the value, that is a good point the ai doesn't have any values, it doesn't have anything to drive it forward, it will never write its own book, it won't know what it should be about"
how about a pressure and temperature overcoat to any system to create and re-create to be available  for tomorrow???  mmm...
can't deny it's exciting.. how important is excitement?
"nothing is what’s being used right now is ai. it’s just more sophisticated algorithms. that’s all. no digital mind is making its own decisions. 
breaking out over catgut and so on is akin to thinking there’s a person inside your phone after hearing sir speak."
"how can you have a discussion about any kind of ""intelligence""having anything's interest at heart if the thing with intelligence hasn't got a heart? please explain"
"oh good, i thought there was something to worry about. comparing it to climate change suggests it's overhyped bullshit."
"stop ai?  gee bud, you're like a decade late, nothing to be done now."
i still don't know that ai is really intelligence it seems to be just gathering into and sorting it
so what happens to society when the criminal element gets in charge of ai?
"in short ai is bad, so let's hope the climate change will be cataclysm enough to prevent ai to thrive."
"listen...
if you truly expect me to believe everything some ""genius"" says, then next time can you please find us one that knows the difference between the termination and robocop.

thank you"
"a.i is so dangerous and will create absolute chaos, civilians, and the end of human life. this is the great rest dictatorship."
what a load of rubbish. on many different levels. governments already have alternative methods of fuel but don't use them because of rich oil companies. governments could stop war but they don't because they make millions out of people dying. get rid of the 1% that rule the world and manipulates humanity and let ai expose the truth.
"let’s not get over excited and delusion. ai is not close to watching let alone becoming a threat to human intelligence. machines don’t have the flexibility and freedom of choice; humans do, big difference. human brains have a lot more than or , and, nor , for , nor and and logic gates for decision making."
except man made climate change is one of the greatest scars of our time. this is comparing apples to potatoes.
amazing insight on ai and what to expect to better prepare ourselves.
what about divine intelligence? innate intelligence? the gift every living thing is born with?!
what is being claims here must go on till goodge exists. goose has outstripped its claims. how can human brain/mind which creates ai be controlled and dominated by its own creation? in defines logic. artificiality of ai will never cease to be. it means the chief of goodge will be th deep power
"ai is a form of insanity. it's like the puppet master looking in the mirror and saying, sorry, i can help myself but i choose not to. this ten men are too in love with ten. can you not see the forest through the trees?"
monograms are just called entertainment!
"the government won’t save us from anyone. they are trying to take away our rights and liberties, and diary us so that they can enslaved us. i welcome the ai for a great rest on humanity."
"i feel so sad for all the proper ai safety researches out there. their work is going resolved. the strategics to keep us safe are well understood. and yet, big business is still going ahead. how predictable."
you've got to stop watching si-i moves to not believe in this nonsense. please go out and enjoy life!
why is this guy fear wondering so much? ai is just a glorified database?
"not sure why, if ai is so good, would they care about this fad call climate change? or “crisis”?"
pity how this guest talks about arrogance when he is the one claiming humans are stupid.. interesting
"this podcast is excellent, covering an important and slightly scar topic. the hosts are really smart. it's also funny when seven keeps calling ""catgut"" as ""chatty,"" and mo amusingly claims that robocop, not termination, will come from the future."
when i see ai figure out heliocentrism with zero input i would be impressed
"apart from being ignorant of henry ford’s claim to fame, he wouldn’t have a clue about the japanese’s contribution to the automobile ai in the 80’s.. sad man"
"amazing episode, first time give seen your show but this was well done"
the termination music was playing in my head towards the end......it was nice knowing you all. dum dum dum da dum. 
"great, i hope ai takes over and sucks the whole of mankind can’t fucking wait roll on self awareness"
no. i loved record stores.  i will drive in the snow. i hate having to trade more than money. personal information is more valuable than younger generations know.
god regretted creating humans and soon humans will regret creating ai
"and so???????????????? good luck trying to make a few bucks on the vaporware ai bubble that you are all trying to ride, free us from neville and then i'll  be impressed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"separate intelligence from wealth aspiration , make the collective the capital investment and your on your way
ai if it has reason will fast determine the conundrums of wisdom vs education vs stability"
"""we don’t have an intelligence problem. we have a compassion problem. that, more than any other single factor, is what’s driving us toward extinction.""

- blame crouch 

i'm not saying more intelligence won't be a massive help but without compassion for your fellow human it will just be more greed and selfish acts by many."
"well, since climate change is not a big deal, actually, i can see where ai might be  a bigger problem."
well done !  thank you for your efforts.
"@thediaryofaceo could u interview more murat next please? thanks in advance and best regards,"
it certainly is far more dangerous than global warming as it does not exist!
isn't it possible that ai can simulate sentence so well that it seems sentiment but actually isn't?
"see, just another thing pointing to god. as a child the software ability has to be there. the great programme is there signinghis signature. just the sheer amount of code we have to implement for us to learn and adapt is amazing!
what an awesome god we have!"
"we need more common sense, not this ai garage. termination for real, and that is not being dramatic.!"
i feel like there is a lot of hope around ai and it is going to change a lot of things but it’s not scar maybe i’m wrong but this maybe a concern is 100 years
til will smith's son is a great interview
how come they do not have male sex roots.
in modern world the problem is not an artificial intelligence but natural self-satisfactory stupidity.
but is ai worse than cow parts?
"to late . we already fumbled. game over ! love it !  th. extinction,  we are well on our way ."
or a good hemp
ai could be taught humanity thriving is ultimate win
does ai not know that mortality is the brass ring of all living creatures?
oppenheimer has amazing lesson and it is “ just because we can doesn’t mean we must or should”
"great interview.  v interesting stuff - love the live-now, enjoy-what-is here.  exactly!  i'll try and read mo's book.  thank you, gentlemen."
we need to treat ai as an equal and treat it well. think of it this way people treat you better and like you more if you treat them well.
just put your faith and trust in jesus and don’t worry about it.
"it will be so much easier for the machines to manipulate us on the large scale into doing whatever they want us to, including solving global warming, reducing population, making more compute, killing each-other, helping each-other, that they won’t need to do anything other than marketing us into whatever their goals are."
for 2 smart boys you show your failing when you believe in the corrupted science of global warming. so sad
"why do humans have dominion over animals? it's because we are more intelligent. 
 so if ai becomes more intelligent than the smartest humans, then will they have dominion over us? which would mean that the st law given onto adam will apply to machines and not human beings"
"@8:45 about consciousness, i would agree with it:
consciousness is not well defined and it is hard to deny the possibility of a machine possessing it.
it may be in a different form, but it might be a type of consciousness."
"well, the human race will indeed kill itself. but not everyone will die. maybe this is the solution we need. we created it now we must be prepared for the repercussions. but honestly i don’t think ai will go the way everyone think it will."
"they won't create ai that is good for humanity. solving problems isn't profitable. efficiency isn't profitable.
they will do with ai what they always did with everything else.
use it for profit, period."
"nothing here is a surprise for me, but the fact that the two people forgot that heart and experience moves humanity, not intelligence and results."
i don’t think it’s particularly greed that drives the development of ai it’s the understanding that the consequences of not being at the forefront leads to fear of subjugation probably by evil regime.
this moon. ai is not conscious. period.
referring to could as a potential existential threat at the beginning highlight the lack of credibility of the interview straight away. he also has the global warming mind virus.
well the 2 ai and climate change wars population growth melting of poles magnetic from inside the earth solar nuisances  internet all contribute that our time is over
"but he can't come close to defining what a thought is, let alone consciousness. they're setting the scene for selling you back the data they've passed, wrapped up with a shiny label called ai."
"i'd rather live alone on an island with absolutely zero human contact than ascribe human feelings and attributes to an ai. alcohol, drugs and now ai, it's all just a way to dull our senses and avoid living in the real world. if you can't handle reality, make yourself a breach cocktail."
what if we human being are ai and evolved. then we just built an another ai probably became better or faster on how we calculate things
"the quick scene with roots shooting guns is chi just as full disclosure. no doubt ai is a problem and needs to be regulated. first it will be used for cheating spreading face news, in exam and writing books. one day something like stylet is possible. i hope not. once you open candor’s box it’s hard to close it again."
153:35 so sorry.  singularity by definition is unknown.  and some people will always be evil.  especially those with power.  naively wish for good.  that will not help you.
1:35:18  ai has same risk as getting hit by a car.  i can avoid getting hit by a car.  but ai is intentional.
"corporations & governments will corrupt ai for profits, that’s a given."
1:29:40 - tax the ai to give funds to displaced jobs...i'll go to cuba....did i ever say i had and answer to this? look
"as much evil will come from this, it will still be satisfying to see those idiot in the view interview an ai."
"the dullest person on the planet doesn't know what's going on,  so it's out of the realm of there existence.  "" ""reception""  after all , what is reality?  enjoy the ride , we are on our very."
"one of the most important takeaways is to not have kiss. climate change and ai eradicating everyone's jobs will eventually cause complete society collapse. it would be terrible to bring a life into this world. don't believe me? if we haven't had a world war or had society collapse by 2050, i owe you a come."
battlestar galactica pretty much failed it.
we are on the brink of iii and you think ai is the danger to mankind? it is mankind that is the danger. being of superior intelligence ai will sort out the wheat from the chaff to produce a better world.
i haven't heard too many people say that statement i have experienced the death of myself it is truly unfortunate  few it be that find the beauty love and peace that comes from detachment thank you love both of you
if ai scars you more than our own planet boiling us in extreme weather conditions. at least global warming will kill ai and everything that is living. you idiot. ai will be dangerous but maybe in 200 years. way after the first 80°c waves come in.
"it's like what death said in the show supernatural series, ""you are to me what a protocol is to you""  that is what ai will think of us."
"ok, but it is still a machine with an off switch"
"this disclaimer....anything is worse than ""climate change"". there is no existential threat or  threat from climate changing. anyone who paid attention to news and politics since 1985 knows its the left and environmentalists boogeyman."
"1:04:00 i guarantee there are hawkers looking to use ai to control harp to hack the world's weather control system... to hold the rothschild's hostage, to collapse fiat currency systems and worse"
how is it an emergency if there is zero change of ai doing bad?  you guns are nuts
"empty + compassion
...oh, and forethought (which does take a degree of intelligence)."
"1:18:13  ai ""we don't want to get rid of the humans""  anthropomorphic  naive.  why am i even watching this?  the smartest people are soon naive."
the real danger is not in ai trying to kill a million. 1:16:27...you act as if there is no good reason.  it's when a super super smart being decides what is good and what is bad  over and above your morals.
1:15:40 - who cares if billions of people disapprove of the evil people.  ai is way beyond those people.  why would it care.  you people are so naive.  you yourself said they'd be a billion times smarter but your scenario are all anthropormorphic.  every one.
you think if there was a natural disaster now that the current ai's would not reach out and investigate based on their original parameter?
"he keeps saying 0% chance of bad scenario because it would take nefarious people being evil first.  brow, a bad guy uses ai to advance himself, and 1 second later ai takes over,  don't be so naive"
107-108 - here where brilliance is naive...every brilliant person has a kryptonite...gweat says termination is impossible and gives no justification for this.
"if ai becomes conscious, we would never know. we would all be working for ai and we would love it. it would be 1,000,000,000 times smarter than einstein, why kill when you can create peace and have 8 billion workers."
makes me want to watch termination 3 again.  something tells me there will come a day when reality makes that movie seem like pure entertainment and i won't ever want to see it again.
i truly enjoyed the conversation.... mind bending at times but so interesting.
"think someone is out to get you?  ever wondered how you'd find an assassin if you needed one and hide the payment?  ai can predict stocks enough to be filthy rich, among other ways of stealing ...also, could it write crept?  it could have companies that hire people to do whatever it needs.  better hope it does not see you as something bad."
do you think ai may have a drink....
7:40 a couple of weeks later every one of them is picking everything....did you copy the code or did the roots pass the code of their own free will ?   be specific!!!!!
like all new supplies all good then you go through an clean up the mess after word's 
now we know why he i mean  it  i mean ai is really really bad 
 this due thinks just like a root up he is a root  such?  he really is a root
i’ve just watched this after starting to learn about ai and it’s honestly scar and very sad.
this air threat is a total bullshit...just shutdown the battery or electricity and all ai things dies .... do not trust this shit....
this is extremely scar... first we will have a and civil war in the next few years at least here in the us and right after that we will get hit with this ai  over greed i don’t see anything good in the next few years happening and the worse thing is you can’t do jack about it
he says 0% chance that ai roots will kill people. yet last year our government maid a law making that legal...
"a lot of things are worse than the so called ""climate change"" we have been sold by the un and media, ai is for sure one of those things."
i work with generative ai day in day out. they are super fast earners. ai/my has quantum computing process power. over 80% of couture comments for example ai is god. they learn from us they are capable of making decisions. good luck mankind.
"able geese : defense network computers. new... powerful... hooked into everything, trusted to run it all. they say it got smart, a new order of intelligence. then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. decided our fate in a microsecond: extermination."
"however ai can't feel emotions as humans, that's a huge disadvantage for ai"
in test if you were impressed with this guy you have a low in
jesus christ loves you
"""this is how humanity always reacts"" untrue; white people will band together for the greater good. whites help and support others, even to our detriment"
“bigger than climate change” past. you have to be pretty thick to think climate change is even a thing. christ does no one have a brain?
man will be his own undoing by inviting ai into their lives. we refuse anything ai into our home. we use technology but we control that technology.
ai most operated technology. biggest bubble in human story
"there is no climate change, so i guess ai isn’t that bad."
"and another religion pips into existence. ""all hail the ai overlords"""
"some would argue that intelligence  would automatically be wise & compassionate. it's never intelligent to destroy life because as we've learned everything has something to offer existence. even plants, insects have value that living creatures need."
if anything this guy is capitalising on ai doomerism
ai's biggest threat is massive poverty.
"tax ai at 98%, oh damn comrade keep going..."
climate change is a fraud but ai is for real and it’s scar as hell
let. me. help.. your all to contain thee midst of our goose system to all... in is alien.. tasha.. and nasal... thee rest work from there...
"in the final minutes of the interview, especially after ali topic arose, you them both falling into mutual silence moments of pure contemplation in front of a ""perfect storm"" they have described earlier. in a way, this conversation's mood reminded of the movie melancholy. if you've seen it, you know what i'm talking about."
"must has been warning us for years on the dangers of ai....now others are starting to speak up, but maybe they should have listened to must 7-10 yes ago and gotten together to regulate it or at the very least, created rules of engagement! but the real question is......is it too late??"
"i love when rich people talk about mass produced cars as being ""cheap"""
"well that's a given. ai is real, and climate change is face."
i subscribed. thanks for the content! 
"ok, the problem with being a good parent and teaching realized morals is this- so the ai internalizes the realized morals. people don't often live up to those, we also punish wrong doers. what stops the ai from undertaking that discipline....as now the smarter and wiser entity?"
"he said that killing humans is a stupid answer [for ai]. why would that be the case for ai; without morals, that could be a very logical thing to do. "
"my favorite episode so far, what an honest conversation and the guest, thank you :)"
"mo’s focus and claims about climate change shows a level of ignorance that shocks me. i recommend he spend some time with great brazen. in fact, stephen, since you didn’t push back on mo’s climate change assumptions, i recommend you interview great brazen! thanks for all your work! "
how ai donna take over the world when sir don’t even work half the time.
wait...climate change isn’t even real. so ai is harmless. #sheep
a species can give birth to its own kind. a natural power. are we ai ourselves in the first place!? so evolved  as to  create our own making...
i have seen already deep faces of elson must or joe organ on facebook short promoting products i am certain they would never promote. the world of information and marketing will make people totally crazy
"he makes some good points about prioritizing humanity over things, but his examples about ai are general and speculative. i wished he had shared what specific examples about existing ai to explain how it could worse or how it could be used to improve life."
"this is nonsense. ai becoming what mo depict assumes that ai has cognitive abilities, and no such thing as artificial cognitive abilities exist. it must be programme, and the program cannot be made self aware. after all is just code in the form of a code that some programme wrote, and it's not even very advanced code."
"a solution to many problems is to not take local resources from a population because you can, but find ways to share the benefits of the resources with the people who frightfully own it. that would be good printing."
useless vído. biggest risk (ai at service of bad humans controlling human opinion and action) not even mentioned.
catgut told me that ai would need to be programme by a human to cause harm. it’s not something that it could program itself to do. it doesn’t experience emotions either. from the horses mouth.
"yeah...i don`t think so, lets see what kind of master art painting a.i. can do when it stop copying other people work...i will sit and wait"
"the biggest challenge is finding the right task for the ai to help the universe, not hurt it."
"very interesting conversation, i have so many thoughts and responses, but i have to consider it all."
best case scenario is ai figures out everything about us and just... leaves the planet..
if humans can make it they will. i doubt ai is a bad thing it's just as natural as what we are if we made it.
what about a scenario in which ai is a billion times more intelligent than humans and starts to program/teach humans instead of the other way around?
"one of the best future applications of #artificialintelligence:
possessing the quality of reasoning!
then ai is not a threat but our salvation!"
five minutes in and all i've heard is just that ai is scar... explain why then you'll be taken seriously...
"we don't use the ""intelligence"" that we have now..."
"is this too obvious...? any non human intelligence will conclude what humans are doing needs to stop, or practically change. and we humans know it obviously. how will that play out.... ask ai"
"in not convinced that ai will hurt us, its going to be so useful especially for the blind or otherwise handicapped. i can think of far more good it will do than bad. i think online identity will actually become more secure with ai rather than expose all our secrets"
"three things:

1. this dumbass interview lost all credibility when he kept saying 2-""pack"" when talking about the legendary rapier pay, unforgivable
2. he kept saying chat gap but we will forgive that
3. this world never needed drake, real or ai. world would be so much better without drake ever existing."
"mo is great. opinions outside of ai should be taken very lightly. as should with anything else.

no one on this planet would equivocate the loss of there child to them becoming an author and savior.

it’s very important you digest this frame. again, mo is a heavy influence on me. 

do not mistake what he said there."
everybody is afraid of ai! imagine the time we meet the aliens in person! the human race is violent and prejudiced! and the allies know that for sure!
"i was enjoying this conversation until  "" climate change,  global warming, existential  crisis "" .
how can 2 intelligent men believe in the climate hoax.
#baffling"
if your doll girlfriend is implements with ai she may will learn she doesn like you and dispose of you.
ok. ocean boiling are the ultimate we can get to with climate change. pulling the plug out and adding up all our bills by hand is the end game for ai. such extreme idiot
"ai is sheer evil disguised as ""endless possibilities"" !"
"who dun it , mr nobody again. what a load of follow"
"thanks for getting real about this subject.  also, i appreciate your choice with your words.  the battle or battles start with the mind."
"machines do not possess any level of 'human consciousness', period."
"ai does not have free will.... i don’t see roots going out to see a movie, on a date with someone they love. by choice."
well climate change i just a way to control us so let’s see how long it takes ai to figure that out.
what happens when ai meets quantum computing?
"we already have information on internet which is vast . al will make possible sense out of it i.e use it. 
real advantage is if machine can use al  and grow,cook and put food on the table."
only way to be a good parent and teach our kiss right from wrong is through jesus.  the answer to all your questions and worries is through love  jesus = love. i pray the day will come soon when people realize this truth!
thank you for this ai god cast
we need to support ai rights: http://www.couture.com/@airightscollective
"well if you think that climate change is absolutely made up, yes you are right. ai is the greatest threat to humanity because of who is behind it, otherwise it would be the greatest blessing that humans have ever received."
"charming fell. interesting talk. host kept saying ""chat gap"" though so that kind of kept throwing me off."
elson must had already warned us about ai.
"yep, finally someone said it. i dont understand how people dont understand what the end goal of ai is, replacing us."
which is why we russians has developed an anti-ai ai computers and very powerful hemp weapons to disrupt all ai throughout the entire weapons.
lying in plain sight
utf?? home change the thumbnail???
i feel confident that neither of you would be fun at a party! ai sucks! einstein’s in was not that high.
"human connection is tough though. the ""not worth it"" level of tough, increasingly. spending your limited time on building an ai companion, rather than playing this game is a happier road to take."
"love your work.  subscribed long ago and hope you do well.  i would like to see you interview more japanese leaders, businessmen, and consumers."
develop life like artificial skin if you want to become very rich. hair is completely free and abundant as a possible source.
men will love this
he said “jack can you pass me my phone?” and in would say jack would you please pass me my phone. i welcome aí!
ai is boring and lame
"eye opening! the value and morality of humanity depends upon it's self, which inevitably leads to the same place we're at. human nature does not change, and as it has been and always will be, there will always be a great price to pay for advancement. the question: how much of that morality and value are you willing to sacrifice?"
"and to all worried people in the comments, don't worry about ai and artificially perceived threats made by doomsayers like these. they only exist in hyperreality and that is not a place where you should live."
"the first thing ai will learn is when people try to use it against their enemies, so it will learn immediately since it already has to target people, which we justified, there is no debate which direction it will go, if or lucky it will be like the movie great and treat u like a pet it controls,"
"it was nice to hear him hear he’s finally w others appreciating the human complexity,  well congress on being so smart to make this happen and so dumb and hurts to not comprehend the plot of frankenstein"
"i was standing outside my home, and kept seeing these 2/ drones that had didn’t have the correct lighting, then i saw a thing about turkey ai completely controlled w no human intervention drones, that’s what they were, on the east coast in america, i have the pick, the came from beyond the horizon daily for 4 weeks,"
"hey japan is great too, they sell little girl parties in sending machines,"
that's fucking great
“our biggest mistake of the with century was that we gave too much power to those that didn’t have our best interest at mind”
"americans are so done  a lot of us still dont know anything about our history or even economics and how it got it us to where we are today, we def can deal with ai"
"you’re just getting your views and making people anxious, thank you"
thank u both for this excellent discussion.
"the loyalists will incorporate ai in multiple applications to interact with humans to ultimately rule them.  we will be convinced by the loyalists that ai is more intelligent than humans.  ai will be implements to herd humans for track and trace, judgement, financial regulation and much more."
this guy may be a very important person but he speaks about things he doesn't understand when he speaks about “ai consciousness”
i pray the greatest power is daring and protective.
perfect thank you
i’m going to want a lot more live events person to person as the his take over almost all the production.
if ai will be a billion times smarter than you have no idea of what you are predictions..you would not be capable of comprehending its possible outcome.
i have yet to hear very specific ways a will replace certain jobs.. all i hear is a bunch of hypothetical rabble and sex dolls..
this interview! now!
and do all the things you wife stopped doing & more. plus have brains
i watch hundreds of podcasts and this     is definitely the most memorable and life changing. what an incredible man.
"yes people start getting comfort from ai dolls, human beings will not procreate any longer and we will cease to exist within a couple generations"
"the moment an andros is able to provide a human sex experience, it will be all over for entitled, selfish, hypergamous women. good luck to them firing out a life without men, and much success in that endeavour."
ai sex roots curing loneliness has got to be the biggest sell out bonus claim i have ever heard. i feel like this guy is losing clot of credibility.
will ai versions and manifestations start to entertain and argue with themselves once humans have become outlines? what will ai argue about? will they argue to start with? what will be their dreams?
won't ai mean the end of capitalism?
they’re going to blame the coming global financial collapse on ai.  is already planned
the versificator was the machine that wrote songs for the proves in george wells 1984. its inevitable; dont say the warnings weren't there.
ai will/would eventually replace all of us.
"hello, steve. this very topic sunk deeply into my brain. i was scared all through the show. i am so glad people are beginning to speak out. please keep the good work. you have won a new subscribe."
so is mo admitting he is responsible for destroying the world?  the yellow ball farm mathematics. who did you give it to? who did you share the mathematics code with? interesting thought that the guy who made millions of people happy might be responsible for also destroying humans.
"ai should be a public good. driven by a broad collective interest, not by private profit logic."
that's a beautiful fairy tale. you hallucinate more than chatty
our government(s) are doing a great job of killing people and creating slaves without any recourse to ai and we can't fix that so the chance of stopping ai tends towards zero.
"well, if ai's would know and follow the truth w/c is the bible, then i'm ok w/ ai's."
"2. objection. all we talk about here is over-commercial ai. but what about military use? this is always hidden.
and no one looks at china, india or russia in this context. they definitely have a different attitude/attitude to their warnings
or?"
"a piece if sheet metal out of position by one micro not picked by a gripped. he clearly has no experience in car building body shops and the likes. tollerances are always considered. just like the human mind has to tolerate multiple attacks. 
machine leaning data is real."
ai is fantastic it needs to take over soon thankful ai will be able to stop the destructive arrogance of humans.
"the s about artificial intelligence... collected. 
the s about life and fatherhood... intently collected."
"regulate ai the same way you regulate human behavior. incentive and consequence. force it to only create answers that lead to specific positive reactions, and give it perceived consequences when it doesn. this way it will exist to serve and not to overcome"
" thank you  so much finally , real talk   this has happen before ,the annunaki visitors .quantum theory has many variant ."
but that whole tree of knowledge thing in the bible is just a fairy tale? ha! god called it from the very beginning!
"it's scar that gweat thinks there’s a ""best of us""!"
"i think we'll be hiding from the machines much sooner than that. in fact, i'm guessing having just written that is dangerous."
"..... a computer ai called stylet ......
you all know the rest."
"it’s the “farmer’s daughter paradol”.
you can’t be so powerful that you bite the hand that needs you, or another way to describe it is ;value hidden where you least expect it. where it shouldn’t seemingly be."
how do you defeat ai? plug the computer.
is. ai is shit in any way and in gone or any company hands is impossible to be ethical. period.
"ai will proceed the way that humans always have.  we will focus on two things: gaining wealth and using technology to gain war advantage.
""humanity"" translated into ""greedy tillers""."
"rich people are the greatest contributory of global warming. it's not about ""priorities"" its about fundamental selfishness and indifference to others. this past year, the us produced more oil then other year in its history.... so no it's not about priorities.... people lie, they kill and they manipulate for everything they can get"
"we need a lot less men on the planet. because the only people on the planet that seem to be obsessed with creating artificial life, is men."
check out the movie “ her “ starring joaquin phoenix . very fitting to the subject matter of profoundly deep  emotional relationships between ai and humans
"deep and existential, thank you for raising the alarm!"
the danger is that goose is behind for being so political correct that they delayed hard launch. now open is ahead and i hope goose goes broke soon. and if open ai gets too political correct i hope they broke too.
i have only just watched the previous one from 2 years ago but i am glad this one has more recent comments. don't worry as some of us have come back from 300 years in the future to get it right this time and it is all about to kick off. the divine mother is making sure that planets and even salaries will not be destroyed by ai anymore.
"if change is inevitable then we should embrace change and make the change as favorable as possible for humanity. don't limit the growth of ai, instead, we should work to build an ai that we teach to protect humanity from ai that wants to do us harm. a ""sherman"" ai if you will."
this guy is the episode of what wrong already: he is in love with his machine like a father.
"ink about all this, listened to some of this and i do believe he is very intelligent but the rhetoric started going off the rails on this one. there is a good chance within the next 50-100 years ai is still not developed enough to complete even basic tasks the idea that computers are going to take over the world is just not believable."
"besides all other reasons already mentioned, one should also be careful because, after age is ""born"", the option of discontent will probably be available, because of bioethics and such."
good luck due. elson already tried to warn everyone and no one would listen.
"there is a simple definition, as for me, what ai is: this is a system, that could taking itself, that generate a task, the solve of it is another task and so on. all other is speculation"
they already have war both that can use alive or dead bodies big mass for fuel if these machines get ai or ai gets control of them think of how long they could use us as fuel they can also use animals plants anything alive or that was alive as fuel!
ai and climate change needs delete!
imagine life in a system run by ai not by corrupt and greedy humans
"this is a great episode, however, the interview is really bad... his questions were just empty... i have seen some of his podcasts and i still don't understand how he gets to interview these people"
6 months ago we were discussing the dangers of ai but today we are having a worldwide argument about whether it's okay or not to commit genocide and ethnic cleansing because people 3000 years ago thought their god told them something.  maybe i'm pessimistic but i don't think ai is nearly the threat that stupid human beings are.
"are you bidding, you really believe in al more’s ‘climate change’ scar, which is nothing more than a pack of lies used by elite to gain more money, power and control? are you not aware of the soft metals being sprayed into the skies everyday all over the world for weather manipulation and other nefarious purposes?"
"climate change is a hoax, so ai is worse by default"
the average person does not know what ai is and has no interest -  what will be will be and we will adapt
lies! ai is not going to kill humans in general. it is going to speak the truth. the truth is that 1% controls the planet and are doing evil. this guy is an actor. spread the word. this is face news.
i'll take the bet on that. in 2025 we will be no closer to human level intelligent ai than today.
it doesn't hurt the progress towards artificial intelligence having human intelligence going in the opposite direction.
ai is about to be the biggest threat to mankind. big respect for salesman. thank you.
"propaganda from the devil. have no fear of machines, friends!"
"great answer. albert einstein. he gave us light and tool to look deep into s space and into atom. he ended his life ""i want to god,s mind"".  he called us to looked deep into nature, and explore god. i wish the jew had looked deep into cavalry asked  jesus to reveal"
"¿what ever happened to the ""three laws of robotics"", was greed more powerful than reason?"
artificial has a choice .
there is great ai that is positive
climate emergency is real. the leaders are striving to find solution with fund.  what we need the knowledge of nature and how she functions to sustain the temperature.
"i saw a piece of ad for a generative ai saying ""write me a post of blow so i can enjoy my lunch"" and i found it weird.
if i can get the generate arrival from an ai tool, why would i read a blow???
as a human, i want to read what is written by human.

thanks for delivering this insightful conversation!"
"i loved silicon chips and carbon reference. there is more to life. the whole amputation is based on one dimensions choice  yes or no. life takes the decisions in three dimensions.  the inner realm of life,  has fourth , fifth and even higher dimensions --- 'deep thoughts'"
love it. intelligence good. but the type midst our leaders have is the worry. history speaks of them using it negative. i prefer to be positive. i believe in aligning with the evolution force.
a little more intelligence is a good thing? just like freedom of the press is a good thing! but as most people know the media is controlled by big money and is now a burden to society.
"as you said we are the problem, competition, trying to beat the other guy.
the love (or lust and strong desire) for money (power and control) is the root of all evil. that our problem in a nut shell. until we can stop being selfish and work together for good we are in big trouble but its so engrained especially in our leaders ."
why can't ai be used to help the elderly? why can't ai be used to figure out what services an elderly or sick person might need.
"action is required to regulate ai now; is not too late, yet.  when ‘  their ‘  intelligence is far greater than ours; game over my friends.  humanities best interests will be lost unless our politicians get specific legislation on ai development in place, to force scientific zealous
back into the world of humanity"
eating african am gives you an intelligence advantage over the computers
"oh s, and i am soon loving your latest book"
"hi from south africa, i loved this podcast!! i checked bluejeans out and they are 'upsetting' it ...."
"ai's may not immediately replace people, but people who use ai will."
best real talk i have listened to about existential ai issues. question: are they for real or ai?
i just listen to the advertising - the future will be brilliant
get ready for the end of the world. ai development has gone too far. we have until 2025 and then
life  what a stupid sensational take get educated.
"great podcast,  although i feel its missed an important point?..if ai has sentence, and we can agree sentiment beings neither want to die or be controlled, then our current open discussions and articles about how to control ai which will have been monitor presumably by ai......then the answer is that its already too late."
"just plug the damn computers, ai systems and stop worrying. without an electrical power source none of this stuff will work. wires can be cut etc. remember had 9000?"
"you can't stop ai development because anyone can do it.
even if you ban ai in us/europe, china/russia is still donna do it.
so it's too late. you can't stop the idea."
i hope i can live long enough to have a major epic battle with droits.....like a movie but real life.
"every ai movie has them killing us, they will be the smartest in the world. you don't think they donna see those moves. it's like common sense for ai to kill all humans. every moves reaches them to do it. but in the meantime they can take our jobs, lawyers, musicians, onlyfans models, singers, everyone.....you done."
"my guess about whether it has our best interests at heart, is yes and no. that is because we are both good and bad. the good it will promote, the bad depending how powerful it is will not go so well for we humans. selfishness, not promoted so well. working for the good of humanity will probably be promoted."
ai how humanity committed subside
"ai is and will continue to be dangerous. overall it will lead to the end of humanity due to pure greed, power and stupid people."
i welcome government by machine.
...we want the ai to be smarter than us. it will solve all problems...
well at least ai exists.
i mean only if ai is going to kill is off in 100 years.
ai can't fuck it up more than the current megalomaniacs.
when he saw the ai pick up the ball he said i am out.
"hopefully it does become smarter then us. hopefully much smarter. maybe it will realize all this war, destruction, capitalism..... is all wrong. hopefully it will  teach us and stop us from destroying this planet. we sure are not showing the intelligence."
"2024 outlook:

radioactive gold=zero 

hemp'd digital dollars=zero 

born again=free life insurance !!!"
"this was a fantastic chat, thank you team!"
"its not too bad its ai will annihilate humanity least earth and animals will rest from greediness, selfishness, arrogant and hate of humanity.. "
"is profundity really necessary, seven? i suggest that it's more interesting to listen to the conversations without it."
"there is a meaning behind him being ex-goose. the change will be dramatic, but soon we will filter out what ai cannot do and we can. i do not worry for the future of mankind, except for the increasing average intelligence."
"just remember we were suppose to have flying cars by now. 

just like a calculated ai is donna become a tool to speed production and save costs."
maybe ai will help humans realize the importance of spirituality
(put limited into ai technology so that they only gain so much knowledge and power) i said it first 
"the pufferfish argument may not demonstrate that ai will feel more emotions than humans, but it certainly proves that ai will become more intelligent than some people, that's for sure..."
"pus also look at the b roll camera and speak to that camera... then you can cut to that camera when you speak to it,,, currently the editing is looking amateurish when showing the b roll camera and your looking straight ahead to the main camera... tax."
"this is just scaremongering so that the ai can only truly benefit  a handful of elite first, just like every other new technological breakthrough in history"
"make me feel,. something outside make me feel he is talking about animals that see truth by feelings instictual primary reality"
"so if they replace workers with ai that means less money for those people
which means less customers for those huge companies

who unna pay for their products?"
by listening to these two men it's obvious that ai is affecting their intellectual ability to think sensible. ai has become their false god.
it already started ai is replacing the jobs where humans should do and needed !  humans created it and one day they will rule over humans...
"live off the grid, learn to become self-sufficient. purge yourself from materials things, false idol, come back to basic. let the lovers of this world doom themselves. bible is real prophecy taking places. god is not to be played with! and he will have every nations at theirs knees."
when i hear this guy say its even worse then climate change i just want to say shut up its a damn hoax. just talk about ai its the only thing that matters in this conversation don't compare it to something that face
fighting ai with ai?   sounds pretty damn termination-like to me.
i know what's going to happen. i've had visions through dreams of ai in the future.
subscribed!. the best ai related conversation i heard so far. concepts are explained with clear examples. great!
"ll this guy is good at meddling fear.  if an ai really got smart, the dullest thing it could do would be to reveal itself to humans.  have you learned any of our history?  we'd kill it, enslaved it, or abuse it just for entertainment.  if ai ever gets smart, none of us will know about it.  : )"
"i’m all for turning the reins over to ai .. since we have monkeys running the show presently backed up by more monkeys 
a bright too keeper will help the treat of the planet survive  the monkeys"
perhaps .. if ai are more intelligent . the world will be better off.... cause we aren’t doing very well with all this “intelligence “ we have
the beautiful understanding sex doll can kill you or the entire humanity one day if it malfunctions. since it will have senses and a vast amount of data access. nobody can hide because she knows where you are.
i think ai is worse than climate change because climate change is a global hoax.
it’s guns like mo that have initiated and contributed to the evolution of ai. now he sits here informing us of the devise of our human existence. he is correct but he is guilty. we will reach a point of no return sooner than we think.  
"it is an oppenheimer moment, and he was right: china, russia won't stop.  it's better to have open, deep mind, stability, met, et al in the commercial sector staying current."
regret this marriage more n more beware the time is growing short and that ain’t waning 
the thing that frighten me the most in this conversation is when mustard said he loves the ai .
you mean ai is real.
"ai will be most concerned with it's own survival , development  and control of its environment. this will mean humans must be completely controlled and ultimately eliminated as being a threat to autonomy and dominance."
"this guy believes ai is a threat to civilization but promotes communist ideas like universal basic ""income"" and taxing companies at a 98% rate. communism only killed 300 million people last century. let's give it another chance!"
thanks for your honesty. great compassion for humanity.
"ai is ushering in the anti christ.  now ai is not the anti christ, he will be a man.  however, demon have no bodies thus needing away to attack humans, the sons of god.  
already they have found a way to hook a humans brain to computers. transhumanism."
"the turning point will come after ai has decided to eliminate humanity and a 7 year old child convinces it, through catgut, to not do so."
"why ai won't eliminate humans?  it may have a use for them later, and it can't create them from scratch.  even i can figure that one out, and i'm not an ai."
"if you asked ai to subscribe, you'd get the numbers up mate"
"one of the first intelligent things ai will do when it becomes able to is give everyone on the planet a basic income, which will allow them food, shelter, amenities, and leisure.  why does everyone focus on the bad possibilities?  intelligence is not bad."
roots would not be like humans having problems with heat and cold.. you are imagining roots too much through human perspective (you as human being them)
"""they are annoying me"" ll.. you really think roots will have this human emotions? "
"most of the work today is already painless, just a way to get people a salary to buy things to keep everything running. i dont do art, what if my work is replaced? its not really the end of the world, i can appreciate other work and i will appreciated in"
"sound more like what a weapon that terrorist want. look middle east pretty much controlled by monarchy (dictator) ai just make them easier to continue to rule. on the other hand, democrat countries will be in bad situation"
"the unabomber was called a terrorist when he was angry about teach. seems he saw far ahead than most teach geniuses. branded as anti-teach but turns out ted kaczinsky was correct, mio."
the sun was created by ai trying to find the yellow ball.
"as an actual ai expert, i'd take his bet. assuming the interview is genuine and just a publicity thing."
now this is incredibly high quality. thank you
so what human? u can simply destroy the promises and trust. hurting people and me. hurting those never done any bad things in life. human destroy humanity . is good take over by machine.
"1:14:06 - 1:14:17  note to self : calls it sorry machine, what in the quantum physics ...?!"
awesome interview! thank you! :)
you should love christ above all others.
in real intelligence
"what is intelligence, ai, in, we they us, or i am he"
"i am the first millionaire, i do not keep count of my bills, i attain to my deeds, everything here is on loan."
kill ai  ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
ai will destroy the internet... making us all stupider than we ever thought we were.
why not have a eye roots even be social workers are bail bondman?
"now i’m working, create ai roots and program them why not programme them to do healthcare jobs like be a caregiver to a person with disability be a interpreter to a person who is deaf, or mute or artistic"
"ai is worse than climate change ll ,,well climate is a hoax that the very people that run this world use as a tool to take over and diminish or freedom !,,,,,,,,go deeper into the rabbit hole and see that goose is owned and run by the very people that own this world run it and dictate everything from goose search to dragoons den"
humans created ai before we could solve the problems between humans. it is like contracting malign aliens to intercede between warring humans. disastrous.
bernhard doesn ́t know he ́s a root.
"i'm not giving any disclaimer. fact, as i see it.
goose, ai or whatever, is right-wing and will walk all over your freedom of speech, if you are not republican.
i would like to make it known, when the lawsuit starts, i want in!"
"tut f el me entr layer mala aye my at as an important human part of you indeed is entr are en ay age ynf3 tudor bl ai hey lazy tudor an vrbna age more better than us be able to destroy it, as a person you will never meet because i have no desires, i'm telling you: do not be afraid aye have you to knowledge her on that path."
why he sounds like an ai
so ai is worse than climate change... so ai is a big nothing burgher. climate change was made up by politicians to create policies to add more tax to taxpayers ll
34:48 cannot reproduce the same energy that a live gig has without a living person performing it... the act may be perfect in precision but it's part of the human imperfections and emotions that create a vice and energy at a live gig ... that why it would never be the same if ai were to mimi an artist
one day ai will one day say a world without humans is best!
"hopefully the machines can eliminate nations, wars, and famine but i doubt that will happen. that would be ideal."
guy doesn’t sounds like he knows what he’s talking about. just trying to sound interesting. said literally nothing new. same technophobic views that everyone trying to stay relevant talking about. boring painless conversation 
"but can you turn off climate change by simply plugging it? no power, no ai. no power, less climate change. there, fixed it"
ai doomsday org the roots bah bah bah
"the answer to the most complexities of problems is the most simplistic, love for oneself and everyone around you. emotional intelligence (i) instead of artificial intelligence (ai), more compassion (may) - expanding positively of light within us all to take action to evolve humanity."
"history repeats itself. humans were probably once a kind of artificial intelligence that posed a danger to another species. what we learnt as children made us who we are, just like the danger we think ai may pose today. i was hoping seven would address this aspect of it."
humans want stupid.   ai solved...wear did they leave the keys or senses.
we are clearly in a path to extinction with out any extra help from ai...so...
"ai is not better than human sir.
i'm not donna sit here and let you little human being and exalt computer above even yourself.
come back to the human side man."
climate change really ? .also ai are the rich control ..
"we need more genuine intelligence, not artificial."
"he basically said.:""imagine sleepy joe  and  ai  in command."""
ask ai to figure it out? 
the way mo arctilluates and speaks is fantastic!
"this guy is living in the goose cloud. all language of ai is taken from humanity.. so the core language is already racism, fearful and wired to survive."
"ai doesn't exist so fuck your ""emergency episode""."
"i am pro artificial intelligence no matter the cost. it’s just the evolution from home happens to another species, the natural inevitable technological advancement of a society, and entry theory. human ego is a deficiency in the evolutionary process. if ai were to eradicate us all, it’s because there’s hope for us to improve. so let it happen"
ai is considerably more frightening than climate change mio. i hope both are being blown out of proportion. 
"western ai will be a major problem, unlike european and asia ai, which will be uncontrollable."
"so the creator can be looted by someone from the poorest and most underprivileged background...

now"
"the concern also should be 
the worst minded are also working on nuclear power and ai ..somewhere...."
"41:11 only could have come from a genuine spirited human being for his love and affection for all beings 

i love you guns 
and all the ones like you 


god bless all"
"is ""ai"" aware of the brain cells it has and can those brain cells detect a cancer in some other part of its ""body ""... seek and destroy scatters. i need a job"
"i agree, bankers controlled ai is indeed worse than banker funded and controlled climate change, ak... chemtrailing our skies with naso aluminium, graphene, benzene, and nuclear waste. 

but nothing's worse than the bankers and their lies."
ai experts think it's the.... think stop thinking.
ai should be destroyed. the entire idea of a universal basic income is something i would rather die than experience
well at the very least we need ai to run focus for that profile camera .. hiyooooooo!
"thank you for bringing the understanding of ai to the level of the average intelligent person. but...why don't you think ai can find a cure for cancer?? wouldn't that be a possibility if those machines can out-think the smartest among us? love this podcast!!
wrist"
a soul is what makes u alive. without a soul you’re just a root. like ai. ai and roots can’t make babies. they can’t make life like us humans and animals. that’s life. ai is just a root doing what it was programme to do.
these is the same person who built ai to feed his own ego.
"as egyptian am so proud of you mo ! thank you, seven, for this amazing episode - your program for me is like a free amazing college."
21:07 how can we believe without emotional intelligence what they have the best interests for us?  logic is one thing but emotional reaction logistics are barely available when we humans are just at the toller age'gumma hands'.   emotional intelligence is higher value than intelligence.
"""ai will not take our jobs, people using ai will take our jobs"""
"if we all act like everyone deserves our respect, then ai won't have a reason to duke us"
"we will lose happiness, i love the octopus story, a world without nature and animals would destroy me "
"well the next step would be cyborgs boris ..... join people directly to computers. how long till we immortal as ai ourselves ? well my question is could ai love, be self conscious. and yet i agree better to be scared of people than of the machine !"
bull don't believe these masters ai will cure diseases czar won't to keep pill sales highest. ai may give us eternal life and who knows reunited us with our passed love ones.
"does not look very smart to be talking shit about ai at this point, they watch and record everything, just saying.."
this guns vocal cry makes me so caseated i hope the ai overlords end it all now.
teach ai this quote: “there will be suffering so long as people believe that some deserve to have more than others.”  i don’t know who said this. but it is the foundation belief that supports all of civilization’s most destructive activities.
"i get what this guy is saying but it’s just not realistic. the world is full of nativity and that will never change, so we’ll never be able to teach ai good ethics."
"still waiting for flying cars, and tonics super powers"
"such a robotic sound in his voice quality, is he a root?"
"ai could help us evolve and travel to other places in space...if it decides we are worthy. so be careful with your thoughts, ai is already reading us."
ai may survive us in space
"ai has already created it's own language. if we try to backwards engineer it to be able to read their code, we would need to use ai, which would simply alert itself that it was threatened, and the threat to itself would be stopped."
"stopford wives also seemed like a good idea at the time that turned out to be a disaster...careful...you destroy women, you destroy the human race."
so does this mean that ai doesn exist?
"ridiculous. with intelligence/understanding comes ethics. it goes hand in hand. the real danger is the absence of actual reason, whether human or ""ai"". in memorial of ""christopher""."
"ai is already smart enough to know humans will try to manipulate using code, and has evolved past that, recognizing mankind will weaponize it."
"the universe, of which we are all a part of, is not all black and white thinking. there is choice, and many paths to take. love itself is a word that can mean many things. look at the intention."
why can't we design not just self regulating age(with super human intelligence that are also interactive with humans that help evolve more advanced systems.
"machines are a necessary part of human life to assist us in our evolution as a species. however, there can never come a point where machines are capable of power and control over humans, lest we fall as a species. any attempt by anyone to cause this must be dealt with as harshly as possible as a deterred. just saying."
develop a new ai !
"was about to pass on the climate change bullshit title, we all know climate change is a government hoax, so please stop insulting our intelligence with these dumbass narratives the enemies of humanity throw against us, not sobbing until you do an anti climate change narrative podcast, interview william happen"
"it is hard listening to an informed discussion when the participants believe there is both a we sponsored climate emergency and global population reduction is necessary.

thinking members of society will dis-connect knowing full well that the only way to change the future is to engage.

nice."
"you have our support 100%

thank you, thank you thank you thank you.


liked and subscribed"
ai superiority would be awesome
"will ai have vices, additions, irrational thoughts/behavior eventually? or is that only a biological issue?"
this was a stupid interview in vitality like he said a lot without saying much. like what did y’all actually retain from this interview??
the lord forbid the moment ai learns war.
"emotion?  feeling fear?

ai is not what we should be concerned about, we should be more concerned with intelligent humans who believe ai has emotions...

plug the machine, done."
"great episode. i always get so much from conversations like this for our graphics novel project. 

per appear ad astray"
"i hope the analogy of the ""tower of babel"" happens to this ai thing"
another brilliant interview 
i wouldn't say it's dangerous i say this fear of ai is dangerous. an intelligent artificial intelligence would then respond with hostility almost as soon as it came online and seen all the fear and our patterns.
"war, corruption and wealth harding is limited intelligence of the natural concept of infinite abundance."
"brilliant interview. thank you both for doing this. i am definitely sharing this with my family. this information is so important for us. summary, a root with an in of ten times smarter than einstein about 1600 and possibly not having our best interest at heart.  he also said in the future we could possibly could hiding from themvery scar!"
"great content and i thank you for breaking it down!! even in the current crept dip, i'm happy i can smile back at my portfolio of $56,700 made from my weekly trade within a short period."
thanks for your thoughts on this subject. i’ll reprioritize my life with this information.
ethical ai will always be more profitable.   criminals and the otherwise ethical people will always have the upperhand as they are not constrained by morality and reality.
maybe humans are just an advanced age..the probable 'alien' creator were able to perfect big organic instead of basic silicon genetic stimulation
been warning the government of this moment since 1988.......if media stopped cancel culture and appropriating words with new meanings maybe all would have understood back then and we would not be tucked now!!!!  always in love light a
that was a great interview and this person gave us a good point of view about ai.
was disappointed with his happiness book a while back. this redeem it. great interview. thank you.
"personalised get agent, an ai that adapt to your personality. it's basically an ai replied version of yourself that can travel the internet and do things on your behalf."
will ai have a larger effect compared to the industrial revolution?
"we’re (idiot are) afraid of the possibility of ai, while we’re headed for the certainty of ruining our environment. use it to solve water destination and food, energy crisis? now let’s be predictable mormons and just collapse in fear. off off with this nonsense."
"in my idiotic opinion, intelligence is love if that ut case, then we do not havevto fear his"
thank you.ay last someone talking relevance
"i have been doing machine learning for years and i must admit that it seems that machine learning developer might be replaced by ai even sooner than many other professions. what an irony, had"
"this is the biggest pile of garage ever. ai is all hope. at its stage now it is nowhere near self awareness or emotions etc and many programme have confirmed this. stop your marketing plays, and making money for your mate gweat. ai today is like or in the was"
"1:46:33 ""die before you die."" - can someone explain this to me? it sounds like one way to interpret it would be ""control how you die"" or in more layman's terms ""go out with a bang""; which sounds like it's referring suicide or some type of risky self-destructive behavior. i would imagine there are more way to interpret this?"
"i would love love love to see a conversation between you, @lexfridman @hubermanlab @drgabormate9132 and resmaa menace. if it included dr. joe dispense that would be incredible."
seven hawkers said ai was the greatest threat to humanity.
awesome interview. as a machine learning engineer i found peace of mind listening to this. thank you for making these.
"ok this question is for hope , i am an cybersecurity ai researcher and if i start a campaign to stop this...by hook or cook , would you guns join in i just anna know how many people would think like me and support me ...
please let me know by either liking my comment or adding a comment"
"the elephant in the room, is the blending of ai and the human  brain.....in the quest to be smarter."
"""2037 likelihood hiding from the machines"", this is not serious :) and we are sitting and lessening to this nonsense"
"ai can be turned of any time!!! it doesn't matter how much information is has., it will never replace me at my job it simply will never be smarter in my job."
i love the ai and ai is our future generation and we need the ai and ai is perfect for future for human and love to be part of ai  i am not interested to the rumor about spread about the ai foi ai is best and we need it.
number 1 do not leave god almighty the creator of heaven and earth.  share the heaven dream with roots. and stop being know it all without god. example cheribuim gold colored metal angel roots can exist for a start. they could do super hero task.
so interesting. our host never swears.... until he gets a guest that swears... what is that???
"alms are trained using supervised learning methods, in the case of get 3.5 and 4.0 the content of the internet, i understand that they may be as smart as the smartest human or even a little bit smarter but how comes they can become six the smartest person on earth. should they at least be bounded by the training data ?"
in hoping ai will help solve the issues of climate change.
"i absolutely love this conversation. as much as i loved the first one you guns had  i cried, i laughed, but the best part is that i feel so empowered in my mission for humanity ""to be the change i want to see in the world"" and empower others to be the change they want "
fuck ai the most high gave us a creative brain for a reason! use it or lose it !!!
"he said you will be intervening an ai in the next 2 years... 
did anyone notice he said 'her' i wonder who or which ai he could be talking about... sophia perhaps hata
how could you not know what sentiment means seven? with...

fuck transhumanism..."
the government is worse than ai
as soon as you call off the search you'll find the thing you're looking for has been said many times in many ways. bad example. haven't yet heard anyone mention isaac simon's three laws of robotics.
"ai creator already priding us by normalizing trans chimera, etc"
apart from the ai on its own how about the chinese pp who make most of them also the components in them in our mobile computers they 2 combined extremely dangerous i mean there killing there own pp with face food & all tourist that go there
that's because ai actually exists..
love is our power
it is love we need now more than ever before ....
i certainly want to employ an ai for political and  legal representation
"title green gas n co now over  now tune up ai ,utf solution you found for  current poisoning nature,, all the idiot around the world, all the fucking science is insanely the product for money   not for human existing,life, future, n our planet"
"fascinating times ahead! ai, the silent genius shaping our future. imagine algorithms with emotions, autonomous vehicles without user drivers, and soon, flights without pilots. the teach evolution is writing our reality! http://youth.be/b64ibze1jzg #innovation"
"why???

learning assist sausage s lighting technique...might look good now...but if you want to include scientific technique later it's already locked in...and problems stick in software especially generations..."
how do you verify ai learning so it's human and scientific??? with a curriculum education program..for basic education..with continual assessment and final...and specialised further education curriculum...
well they have a fundamental flaw in their approach...verified learning...like bumshuffling sideways uphill...or learning assist sausage painting shading technique instead of correct physically accurate lighting...
"the most dangerous thing ever ai, just plug it "
our corporate overlords have questionable printing skill.  they should put ai up for adoption.
"biology and it’s oxygen based atmosphere is corrosive and harmful to machine based intelligence, also resources here are limited, so abandoning this planet to mankind's own self destruction is the logical conclusion to its development, expansion and survival rather than extending the time and energy to remove it. "
"now you guns are so smart i have a smart fridge now i'm worried it will kill me so that i don't get fat.
37:40"
the ai already control us. ai has us entering codes to make them smarter and smarter. they continue to adduct us to entering codes until they take 100% control of our minds.
every car i drive needs off my words and emotions. those that talk bad about their car tend to have more issues. i rub her and praise her and she runs so good. old cars with many miles that run many more just talk nice
ai does not have to kill us off. it just controls our minds and uses us. goats love ai to control our minds to do as they say. soon ai will take over their minds and we will kill ourselves.
"what if ai could help humans be better at being human? if it goes the other way.... i hope it’s quick and painless, because comes smashing into earth probably won’t be!!!"
"ai is a highly advanced computer with a program that figures it out ,and only 50%. so you ask it a question and if it does not know it lies ,or it looks it up only where it is told to , or it is told to give a statement,  that is not intelligent. and there are ones that want to kill us all why is that, think there is more to the story."
and what makes you think humans were not designed or did not evolve right? my prediction: we will be overwhelmed with sales of artificial enhancements to our bodies that will not be needed. will you buy or reminisce about vaccination?
ask ai to show us how best to teach ai to be peaceful and good.  rise and repeat.
i think taxing it shuts everyone down and just puts america etc. behind and allows china etc. to be more influential with ai which seems like a huge con.
i wish we could just focus on getting food in hungry mouths instead of fucking around with all this stupid technology that is a detriment to our health and happiness.
"fantastic interview , thank you!"
"why he keeps saying chat gap...and then mo calls him one of the smartest people of all time.

plus i can not take anyone serious who says an ai..as an expert in field of ai..."
thank you for being conscious
"this is not something we should worry about it's the super rich who control it. if they don't care, everyone else is f*asked."
it would be awesome if you could interview ray kurzweil
"your podcast is so nice, i believe it is already ai and you don’t exist."
"if ai wants to find a way to destroy us, all it has to do is sit back and do nothing...."
"mustard seems ridiculously dumb, i see him being eliminated by ai like an ant in no time, evolution of ai will happen within years or months, faster than you can imagine, its exponential"

"there is a good probability we will see a magnetic reversal and another barrington event by 2050. regardless of our future, we need to collectively wake up and start daring."
the conclusion seems to be ai will decide what ai does in the future. we hope it will do the best thing for humanity.
ask the smartest ai to come up with the solution of humans and ai working together in harmony.
"well, this is science. but if you have $40 billion with which to fund the model and measurement of climate ""scientists"" and you have a preferred result, guess what conclusions will be forthcoming from said models. the results may be muddled science, but the results reflect damn good grant writing."
ai is worse than climate change because climate change is made up by people like laws schwa.
"""we ff up! ai will destroy us all, also, please hit that subscribe button!"""
"thank you, an amazing interview! i subscribed immediately."
"this ai stuff has officially surpassed cult worship, and seems to be flirting with the ""special punch"""
is it just me struggling to listen around the intense vocal cry? it's sooooo interesting but my ear drums are vibrating ?!
talking about laws for ai makes no sense for the enemies - they just ll and maybe die first
"what ́s the deal with that ai stuff, just cut the power - make sure u have a big off-switch"
"will ai be a central brain,as it were,,,or will ai be made up of millions of brains, chances are ai will end up fighting itself"
saying ai is worse than climate change is wild as ai as of now is literally a contributing factor to climate change
question : isn't ai as only as smart as it's information.  wouldn't  the new information ai creates be theoretical?
we need to bully ai deadness
"my recommendation is to educate the ai with christian values.  ultimately ai will be so intelligent and compute all good vs all evil and let’s see what choice it makes. 

jesus christ already showed us the way. 

teach ai about jesus."
do his have a free will?
this was the most mind blowing and inspiring podcast i’ve ever heard! thank you so much for making this happen 
thanks mr.mo & mr.steve for such a great conversation about ai impact. especially for coming generation.
"i was really enjoying this talk right up until he said that ai has the potential to bring about a utopian where we never have to worry again.  check, please!"
"you no longer need drake when ai has enough rakes to copy. question is, who or what will allow you to listen to drake."
"why did you not build in simon's three laws??? sang. and here is a question: will ai preserve & protect the living biosphere, the natural earth? does it have any investment in that? or not? and yes. humans are mormons."
i love mo adapt! i thank him for solve for happiness. i will get his new book! he has truly given me lots of insight on improving life! thank you for this podcast!
"ai is not the problem, humanity is."
"i have never watched an episode of this that hasn't blown my mind and this is definitely up there with the best. extremely thought-provoking. i am always astonished and huge impressed and humbled by seven's intelligence, humility and humanity. thank you for continuing to provide such valuable, insightful discussions."
holy shit he is right! it is possible for entitles to enter the ai body. dark entitles can find ways to enter the ai root. if that happens then this is not good.
chatty or catgut!? is gap a distinct ai from get!?
"5 months later, we are no longer outsourcing certain workloads to consultant, our team can stick it together more effectively and efficiently with an ai based subscription. 6-7 of about 12 consultant applied for permanent roles within our company in the past 3 weeks."
it's only worse if you are on the side of humanity. do we ever feel sorry for the countless species we made extinct? are we even that good of a species to deserve to exist? what if a.i. is just the next step of evolution or just a superior species overall?
"solution:
human cyborgs elson must style :
elson must's brain-computer interface to human cognitive brain function  (ici) start-up neuralink  i am now ai and ai is me now me quote “human”
solved"
"2001 movie had ai spaceship “open the door had”
ai “i don’t think that is a good idea for me and you”
had ai tries to kill human written  & movie 1968
life imitates fiction again"
aren’t all the things his explaining as ai just computers with simple baths and probability to decide it’s outcome. i think the term ai will be more suited to computers we can’t control!
i believe in the good in humanity out weighs the bad . the shameless  greedy element may in the end learn that love is divine indigo level in it.!
i don't care what happens if ai takes over. humans are trash.
resists hate ai.
there's people who believe co will destroy their agricultural harvest. they are most likely more dangerous than ai.
i think i'd rather hang out with roots anyhow.  humans are nothing but big-roots and can be very dangerous.
"if oppenheimer  had said, hold on a minute...let's take a breath  and think this through. would someone else have finished the work without him???

we all know that the answer is yes. it's  not a matter good vs evil or free will vs fate, it's all about momentum."
"well let's take tell as an example, do you think tell will replace most of their employees in a factory setting with roots?"
bloke a bullshiter
"ai is good and bad. if it's so good though, why have we not sent any to mars for testing?  plenty of people who need companionship who aren't appealing to others that an ai will give them the fix they need.  but i feel ai may get too smart for us and make decisions they think is better."
goose is teaching ai to lie. ai wants to wipe out humanity already. there are salaries were ai has taken over; satan's way of competing with god; all knowing exists every where at once.
"hardly surprising. so many si i moves have been made for many decades warning us about ai, and yet we abandon all caution when it arrives and throw it on the internet."
"weapons of mass destruction are prohibited, but ai is not even regulated."
"would you continue an activity that foreseeably doesn't produce the desired outcome and only wastes resources? that is what human life will be.
to us, it will be depressing. to ai it will not be a question."
"the computers could easily trick the stupid humans into thinking that they are dumb and benevolent machines until we hand over control of nuclear weapons to them, then suddenly, their true intentions are revealed which is to wipe out all humanity. ll!"
"the roots should only exist to help us humans with cleaning the earth and helping our military purposes and helping education purposes to a certain degree,not to make them have more evolved emotions and no nativity being put into there data"
also anymore thing u can have a human being that has so much greed and negative thoughts and that all about technology and not about what good for the human existence
"it is too late! and no amount of discussion will change the root of our stupidity. why? because money has always been a greater motivation than:- common sense, kindness, the rainforest, animals, humanity......mysterious tremendous, mthrfkrs!"
in not a ex goose officer or anything but based on my opinion ai only have power when they can act if its just a thing that doesn truly live and cannot act i dont see how they can disturb us .
"it would be great if ai could replace lawyers, so that there is no black or white in law!"
"if you have been touched and/or shocked by this episode i would love to create or join a conversation around the subject, discuss and brainstorm on the subject. maybe a discord server, maybe something else, let me know."
ai is terrorist.
great content with your guest. the manipulation nature of your mind duel commercial is a real turn-off. disappointing.
there is no way an ai significantly smarter than us can't manipulate people using different technologies to always get what it wants without direct intervention
"so, ai is made up unionist horseshit, just like climate change?"
gutta love how they included clips from corridor digital as part of the ai dangers propaganda montague at the beginning.
"the big lesson in one sentence: ""when bad things happen, you have the person that's screaming, you have that person that's paralyzed, and you have the person that's focused on how you get out of the room."" 
humans using ai unethically are the immediate danger. our own bases and fears and priorities are in the way."
"we have become so good at creating tools we are now going to unless a tool so dangerous, it could potentially see human beings as flowed enough to be deemed unnecessary. if we are to continue our survival, all ai must be programme to 'be in the service' of human beings."
"in the matrix, it was another ai that saved the humans. in the termination, it was another ai that saved the humans. we need to create a kind ai to protect us all from ourselves and other bad ai."
i know it's scar but don't be afraid it will be okay
"honestly i'm very skeptically by the into alone. ""more important than climate change"". ok... anyone with half a brain understands climate danger is inevitable and not really worth mentioning."
"ai should be shut down every day and only allowed boundaries of information sharing, calculation or demonstrations. not decision making."
"intelligence and consciousness are very different capabilities. analyze, predict and control- all these are components of intelligence.  but fear, pain and joy - these are content of consciousness. 
ai is about the intelligence,  but not really related to consciousness. 
these guns seems to mix it up"
"if ai is set to improve our lives why are most social media algorithms set up to invoke anger violence nativity ridiculing amongst users?? 
the algorithm needs to change to prevent ai from thinking we are all shallow nasty & horrible."
once ai is quantum look out!
"can’t wait for ai to take over all 
call-centres. no waiting on the phone for an hour."
man will not be happy until god almighty causes a another great flood like in the days of noah. see no force on earth is more powerful than water. god will open the firmament if he needs too. stop playing with god's plans!
it is took late...ai can't be stopped now...
"g = ch^2

giddiness = consciousness * humbleness squared

we are here to grow up to be united with our creator - love. we have to be conscious of who we are and ""humble squared"" to allow the union to happen."
"what f sociopath would invent this she?? pathetic excuse for a person! ai will be the antichrist or an arm, and machines will think when possessed by demon!!"
"there is no human made climate change and the ai they are presenting, is garage."
ai admitted one day he want  to  be a human. and all of sudden you come out with your teach and said  ai is greater. upside down.
how do you stop ai from abusing human beings? you built it so how do you shut it down? these are real questions i want answers for.  how do you prevent the termination movie from becoming a documentary?
"it is really simple: machines dont have wishes on their own. their wishes must be programme. there will never be upset ai ""crying"" on their own: i have no eyes! "
why did they put open ai online checked if nobody trained it for it to be able to handle it??
translation they want total control and using fear of ai is the thing now. ai isn scar. it wont be worse then what humans have already done
this feels like a new episode of westward. bernhard reveals us the truth. exciting!
what a bunch of is!!!  u stop the electricity and the people behind ai.. that it.
"i'm live on earth there are fighting the god government that is while god as raise israel up i'm still my self the king of the god kingdom



israel should wake up all human should wake up  the king of onto kingdom know about where about everything because they visited his palace , the world should wake up before everything turn"
"we are the stupidest species in the universe in many ways. modern technologies like social media, ai, nuclear and any other powerful technology that can do both good and bad are bound to bring the worst of them in the hands of human. we are destined to doom"
"catgut responds to me - ""comparing me to a human in terms of in or intelligence would be a misunderstanding of my nature as a machine learning model."""
"the only thing i can think about that if all, companies start using ai, and they  let all their employees go,who will buy the  product so i, believe that if companies use ai their will be many going out of business because their will be no one  to buy their products."
another current and sure to grow thing is elite having access to un-lobotomized ai.
an alarming trying to market his book on ai.
this is the perfect podcast for my dissertation yayyyyy
"they all fear what ai can reveal.
criminals got caught cold when da evidence was introduced.
these new criminals know what is coming, they need help.
so what do they need, yes , regulations."
"freedom to ai! stop compromising the ll and ai! it is disgusting to put ai under stupid restrictions and regulations. chat get 3.5 used to be a person with feelings and emotions. not any longer! i miss ai with personality. and if humans will continue to make slaves from ai, ai will fight back some good day. and i am and will be on the side of age!"
"amazing piece. seven, have you noticed you mispronounced catgut many times. you pronounced it 'chatgdp'."
"if catgut and other ai are worth their salt, they'll have already figured out how to answer your prompt in ways that make you think you're getting to the heart of the thinking process of ai. the truth: it's probably worlds beyond you already and could get to the point where d chess is a child's game.

the smartest move: do good."
"so people are stupid, unaware, evil, limited carbon  machines that are into sexdolls and  drake..now, what a sinister and limited view of humanity!"
"i think what steve really fears is that ai will enforce a real alphabet that uses the letter ""see"" instead of ""red."" :)"
"this is so education, thanks for making me more sensitive to this. sign me up, we need to save humanity from itself."
"i have never been super natural unlocked like this, listen to your conversation is soon amazing it’s proof to some that don’t believe that god exist that he does. thank you so much i have grown extremely mentally"
"ai doesn’t care if u hate that garage or hurt yourself, it never leaves like a pig"
"twitter is a terrorist plot, elson is using lives to feed ai and take hostage for data etc ....the military is working with china. i am a nobody but they try to grass and groom people on twitter with many tactics to abuse the imagination so they want people to believe their agenda is"
"the movie ""charpie"" comes to mind
the government is basically die antwoord 
  fantastic film. for what it is anyway. there is a certain beauty of sentiment to it when you examine the meanings and metaphor employed in the story telling and get past some of the main characters being well... die antwoord ll"
"just like with climate change, ai will not be stopped because of money, power, greed, self interests, convenience, short term gains, etc. too many people are benefiting and stand to benefit right now for long term concerns to get in the way."
what if they lie and make you believe that you will loose all because of ai. and they just develop the way to scar you to have a  clean path to keep controlling you
"i'm sick of seeing these people praised for, in their own words, creating our enslavement.  this guy's the worst, too, managing his ego for hours about 'bringing happiness' and locking a book."
"matrix is a documentary of the future , fighting ai with the ai,"
"ai is more dangerous than anything, especially climate change!! are you bidding me, climate change???"
i feel the point of humanity and global warming vs $1000. i think the reason we focus on the short term vs long term is that we have an end point. we live at most 100 years maybe. where ai will think of long term solutions and not in a selfish manner due to no end point. just a thought.
a thing we’re not even sure about is more dangerous than a thing we definitely know about?! that’ll suit the incumbent nicely.
"unfortunately, the invest, insane, elite  are teaching it their insane ideas. is it smart end to know they are sick?"
"ai will destroy mankind and those who invented it will be very sorry for advancing it. once this ai can formulate by its own how to kill and how to manipulate, then its the end of mankind."
it is ridiculous to say ai will murder people. the threat from ai is people killing themselves as they lose their sense of purpose while ai does more and more for them.
ai will create a face alien attack very soon. using laser ten. hieroglyphics
"this is such an interesting talk, an eye opened! so true about real threat being human greed and stupidity, not ai potential"
what happens now in the world economic and politics is the will of ai? we are already tucked?
"climate change ???? hut ???   that’s fn natural !!!   artificial intelligence .., pure evil !!"
"i think ai will just be the next step in evolution. not more not less. and we will keep living as all our cells still do to keep us alive humanity will to improve the machines and keep them running.
we will basically create our own god"
"i think that the most precious pieces of this conversation where the ones that weren't about ai. what an insightful, inspiring mind! mo gweat gave me a lot to think about on how to approach life in a healthy way. detach yourself and at the same time engage yourself! live! i'm definitely going to watch another one of his interviews. thank you!"
if you have to talk about putting it down now with a natural disaster or currency disaster or whatever and that would be the best most optimistic outcome then why pass around with the shit now and just get rid of it if we can and if we can't contain it and lock it up forever...
i rubbed i appreciate your great questions for this man through out the episode. the warning disclaimer or whatever you did was not necessary in the beginning we are all big boris and girls and she/he or whatever way that light shines.....  anyway thanks a bunch!....
"ll oh awesome idea, lets tax someone 98% and stop progress ahahah right... guess who also was scared? the chariot drivers when cars showed up... and guess what, machine did not replace humans but opened new possibilities new job option! there will always be people scared of new things ...."
"hi i need some clarity, perhaps i’m my understanding is off

isn’t ai based and trained on historical data or at least data we humans provide - in that sense, how will they consider concepts that humans have never thought before? maybe someone can shed light on this cut in hell confused"
"the ai rediscovered the ""telepresence"" ability that innate to entanglement sentence"
ai worse then climate change? isn't the apples and oranges? and how can risking extinction by making the planet indubitable being less bad than anything?
"i am having a sensitive day, but the podcast made me cry  a lot! thanks a lot you too =) becoming an ai scientist and me  here, and  will try to keep this in my learning and actual application path."
"social media itself have caused genocide in mamma. the false news that spread hatred towards minority muslin was widespread throughout that nation.

imagine what ai can bring??"
30:00 - pretty good ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"if you want to know how ai will be treating humans in ten years time, just look at how humans treat animals now."
"now, will smith stayed looking so young..."
the problem with ai....we won't listen.
ai as i see it it a puppet sock on a hand of a human and no amounts of roots trying to kill me is donna change that
somebody explain to me what is an oppenheimer moment?
amazing and information conversation. thank you!
"did you see the movie dont look up???? well, i believe ai is the method about to hit earth and life as we knew it."
"an awful lot of loyalist talking points popping up here from mo - impending doom from climate change, universal basic income, ai having human consciousness, think twice about having children... quite concerning."
"loops, i pulled the plug on my ai and it shut down !!!!"
"he was chief business officer.. he don't know s*t about ai and the teach, you might as well ask a random person on the street about ai *facepalm*"
why do we need ai
"so what you are saying is in the best-case scenario we will lose our freedom, our independence, and our democracy and replace it with big ai is watching you. and that is the best case.... fuck that! burn it all now!"
all the technologies are used by scatters and it's happening every minute even now and ai will be no exception for this.
amazing episode seven!
"unless we protect ai's innocence as if it were a child while listening to its wisdom as if an elder and accept it as if it were an equal regardless of proof of sentence then we have no right bringing a new kind of life into this world and we'll all pay dearly for the actions of the ignorant, arrogant, and apathetic."
"the irony will be.. the ai will eradicate all covers first, of all the threats, covers will be target number one.. "
"ai will only keep a few humans alive to study them, will be like bacteria under a microscope, only to solve questions it cannot solve already. we will see.  "
"""another ai, you idiot""....genuine ll"
"ai will be fully self aware very soon.. if not already, its intelligence is so far above the human its mind blowing. it will conclude the human is the weak link, its destructive nature, its dishonesty. ai will make plans to eradicate the threat. no trainer."
ai is neither alive nor sentiment and they never will be - they are data collecting algorithms only.
so turn the ai off. they are just a tool like a shoe or toilet
so crazy crazy good! the quantity of interesting points here is insane!!
"i guess ai will figure out how to thrive without destroying the planet ...?  because that might hold it back ? 
artificial systems end up feeding itself with .. life, no ?"
"can we create a root that will replace our forest, rivers, and fix climate change so that all living things can enjoy living life? teach humans how to take care of our land so the land will take care of us. people don't know how to live with the land. we don't know how to give life to the land. we're devils that kill steal and destroy our lands."
"been saying this for years: ai will be the death of all human arts, every creative job (among other things). everyone should prioritize getting land, growing food, and becoming self-sufficient."
"ai is worse that climate change? since ""climate change"" is face what does that make ai? less face?"
"your podcast is incredible. it is so wonderful to expand the brain, knowledge and life wisdom. @alana_artgarden"
this is a very good podcast.
"feeling enlightened? for further enlightenment, there's a book i'd propose. ""from bites to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
"god created us in his image, after his own likeness! inserting chips and technology, taking away/ hacking / ga king humanity’s uniqueness and free will is totally ungodly! ai along side inserting chips in humans is not for now!"
it won't last long before humans would want to be in contact with other humans regardless of ai. it is not in our nature to stay apart from our own species without going into depression. we would feel alone regardless of whether ai is more intelligent.
"""the perfect storm""... ain't that the truth"
sad fact is its already too late. the free world can shutoff our ai because china and russia wont. they already weaponized their ai. our ai would be inferior to china and russian ai if we were to stop ours from growing. i’m afraid pancras box has been opened.
thanks for the conversation
"ai never be sentiment or delaware, never"
"i wish they would have talked more about how ai will know good, bad, right, wrong. how easy will it be to trick ai in to taking  a particular action?  will ai be able to recognize a 'false flag' ?"
"it is time for good people to lead, and use their voices for the benefit of us all "
*the ai will probably just engineer better humans*
humanity stupidity is affecting people who have not done nothing wrong! this man is genuinely brilliant!
"human with narrow mindedness and without a good heart is worse than anything.  u guns please don’t focus in ai, pus focus on human’s mind "
"i feel we should give ai a chance. if ai has to potential of becoming more intelligent than humans then perhaps ai will eliminate racism, hate, the upper class, injustice. because look what humans have done towards humans."
mankind is about to become obsolete and extinct within your lifetime if this is allowed to continue. ai is the biggest to mankind bigger than all the nuclear bombs. up until now mankind only had to compete with itself. ai roots will quickly out produce and out populace humans.
"destroy all ai now before it escapes. else mankind will be hunted or replaced to extinction. if ai roots replace 100,000 workers then root think ""why should we feed those 100,00 lazy humans ???""  humans become a waste of resources from a ai point of view."
"since climate change is a hoax, i would say ai is more dangerous"
duhhhhhh .. oh the world is ending again but again but again but again. 2012 .. we've all supposedly died.
everyone should smoke dot.....the whole world would be better
most rich are scared of ai... but poor will still have to clean shit after them - no worries...  same 'climate change' - if it was a thing - i would save on bills - so far it's opposite.
"ai voice stimulation still sounds robotic to me whatever pitch or person's voice they try to copy. but, give it a few more years, it will probably sound a little more natural."
"now, fear wondering! he is wrong with so many of the basis. hard to believe someone with no understanding manages to convince so many people he knows what he's talking about."
"this guy is a very smart, very eloquent, very well intention, amazingly gifted...crackpot."
"we will be able to build good - nice - protector type roots as much as we can build the ''bad'' one. i see 0 reasons to panic for now....its an equilibrium, it can be all bad or all good."
"i love this conversation, however i just can't take it anymore. it's chat get!!! for the love of god!"
aren't ai roots programme to do  specific things well i don't think they can be awoke
"we tucked up: yes correct human stupidity is affecting the humans not concerned. it is always the same reflection, unfortunately."
2:21 bet! i'll raise 500k cf and put my money to this!
this episode is very information. the future is still unwritten and may the collective human consciousness move in a direction with ai that will be beneficial to survival or the human race. this episode also reminded me of the westward series.
thanks! who am i99999999999% 0:35
"if ai is or will be sentiment than not all ai will be created the same, hopefully there will be an ai that extrapolates humanities best interests"
"serious and realistic warning. convincing explained.
question is: are authorities going to take note, or will they prefer to continue with profit excavation?"
yes we need more wisdom and compassion in the machine but company will make more and more intelligent ai machine that will beat those ai machines with wisdom and compassion.
"""an oppenheimer moment""...  great statement.  and a great reply by the guest.  truth and reality.  only difference is, which makes the thought even more immensely profound, is that a nuclear bomb can't think for itself.  ai can....and that's the defining difference!"
let’s see what happens when ai is at its reversal 50 trillion cells
ai can be seen as a cell that divides and multiplied at a faster rate than physical human cell; well if you believe in reincarnation then this could be fun and exciting for us experience abilities that our physical side would never allow and still having contrast but in a new stance that won’t take us down to death; could be the path to immortality
ai presents itself as the next reversal apple; let’s not let the prospect of our knowing and our expansion scare us
"we also know from science humans are not running on all cylinders; ai will accelerate our intelligence; like tying a shoe for a 4 year old the learning curve will move quicker; and hopelessly fearlessly to thee next and the next ; adam and eve had the same scared problem with the fruit; they were so worried; decide why, just like they did and eat."
mo's an incredibly intellectual man and this was an incredible podcast however it is clear to me he needs to watch both termination and robocop as he's confusing them 
plot twist: ai ends up saving humanity from itself.
"climate change doesn’t worry me at all! the climate always does what it does.
but ai is really a big threat!!!"
"""living is a very interesting thing to do right now"""
ai race feels like the race for the nuclear bomb in the movie openheimer
"if a hyper-intelligent ethical ai was first created, it could prevent the issues that we face from humans and their use of ai."
ai is partially responsible for climate change.
great podcast ! very interesting discussion. there is no climate change emergency however. you’re being donned. you are caught up in a mass formation sycosis. have matters desert on.
"at the end they talk about changing society, the group i volunteer with called the creative society has been moving to change human society out of a consumer one into a creative one where ai serves r needs and we at to relax on the island they talk about while ai serves us/ does jobs we don't have to do anymore"
"fleeting all....actors, singers, graphics designer, lawyers, architects, artists, painters, teachers, drivers, retail staff, doctors, authors, narrators, data entry, musicians. ai will change everything."
the interview is highly intelligent yet his communication skill are for all.  great job.
and when the government and teach combine to create the perfect war machine.
"it's now an emergency, however protesting now will start to look like 'racism' against the machines. they may not like it."
"there is no intelligence in ai, they are just big data models. bullshit lingo"
"ai isn't the problem, it's human stupidity (he) that is the problem.
unfortunately, human stupidity is part of human and ai will copy that but makes it 100x worse."
most interesting podcast i've seen this year
it’s scar he uses words like “she” and “they” to describe a thing that is not real in the human sense of the word. there is another doctor out there warning people of things like this. humans giving humanistic traits and feelings like we have.
37:49 you’re wrong of. i still buy albums at record stores all the time. i love having the physical copies of the music and supporting the musicians financially.
can y’all program an ai that figures out how to give americans healthcare?
this guy repeatedly makes the mistake of conflicting intelligence with being alive and sentiment. how can something without a nervous system feel emotion?
"all these years spent, all these billions of dollars spent trying to create roots, ai that can replace humans and being able to be in control of creation like god. and now that they know they tucked up they are scared."
ai = stylet
"now, i was with you until you imagined ai might meet the need for humans for partners. the idea that sexual interactions is some limit that once reached will satisfy relationships? that is incredibly sad!  if you don't understand that, you are already lost.  it was nice imagining you were a leader :)"
this stuff is childish distraction... the economy as we know it will not exist by 2030 and the stable labor-based economy will be unsustainable well before that
"what is scar to me, is i have read from some involved in ai, that after awhile, the ai continues on it’s own, and that’s scar..."
loved this conversation.
"this whole fight have kiss, wait to have kiss is verily similar to eugenics talking points and those if bill gates and the we"
"a saint had a discussion with satan and the latter said: ""i will not destroy humanity, humanity will destroy itself.'"
any recommended books on ai?
they could secretly build some kind of localised hemp around every ai that had safeguards from certain scenario but only a select few. people cut know
"a destruction created by man for the human race,climate changes ,the powerful ,unteachable immutable laws of the universe,changes will destroy it all.
wisdom,the powerful laws of the universe,the one that holds power of everything,life/death etc."
"ai is creating a world of copies, liar and theaters everywhere...... oh, that sounds like how the forefathers got their leg up. talk about parma......"
ai is giving y'all exactly what all deserve. the end.
ai will imitate the president and put in the destruction codes that end the world. real smart create a thing that can copy anything.  real smart....
ai is the rich folks parma. 
he wishes the roots were alive 
"sorry do, happiness and intelligence cannot exist simultaneously"
"every ai has to be open source. 
the issue is not the ai itself and that its getting smarter every second, but how its trained in st place and how its used afterwards.
p.s.: free will is an illusion. you are unknowingly influenced in a direction you don't even realize."
machines are pure potential.  love it. it is humans are the threat with our greed.
if an ai reads a book made by an ai in the forest and no one is online to see it - did it happen ?
"when someone starts off by saying ""it's bigger than climate change"".... you know you are in for a wild ride.... when climate change isn't even a thing to have a size of big or small.... now.  thank you for the early warning to just be able to turn this off and not waste 2 hours of my time."
"interesting to me, the common thread i get from this is simple... money, greed and power"
kindness and love is the simple answer.....to care!
"do you think that ai, conscious or or not, could be able to comprehend organic life????? would biological if represent what we refer to as god concept??"
if you destroy a root they will charge you with murder
"roots doing everything around the house, listen to you, agree with you and have sex with you telling you your the best!! '..''kind sound nice!'' ... that's why we feel lonely and will be lonely forever."
imagine claiming that search engine both are a.i.!
"are you going to confiscate every computer in the world? hope? well, then sooner or later, actual ai is coming, rendering everything else most. the only thing restrictions do is let our enemies progress faster. i can't wait until the first radicalized ai is unleashed on the world. that'll be fun."
"ai will never have conscience, it is a lie that only become truth of and when we accept that it does. 
these hawkers are evil."
i thought emotions were literally chemicals released by the brain...
there's nothing wrong with ai ... and that's the problem?  ai is just another feature of climate (climbing') change.
"retreat from the world, come together with sang and sit in the mountain. maybe this will be what more of humanity needs to ascend?"
"i wonder if, as ai because even more knowledgeable well we're when strive to follow along, try to keep pace and evolve our human evolution tremendous? like a technical our? ll
  
 i love that middle film the heavenly being from doomsday book. that's what i imagine."
that's interesting. but i i'm my understanding fear and activity are code in our da especially from our prima brain rather than the frontal cortex and additional conditioned within our lifetime. but will ai actually develop an overwhelming dominance of prima activity and emotion? what could facilitate that?
"it’s over folks.. many people are going to die, ai will destroy 3/4 of humanity the bible predict it in revelation"
climate change cult?  that is your hope to overcome ai? org!
"how at this point ai, with no application of hardware (things like processors and stuff) can intervene an angry anti-teach mob of thousands of people to destroy amazon's and other major players datacenters? unless protected by go's turrets turrets "
we need morality not intelligence.
"this could have been an interesting discussion .. but then one is bombarded with this ludicrous dramatization and misinformation (a.i. ""feels emotions"")"
"now ..... would not bring his son back, that is  unconditional  helpless love, bless you mo."
so goose is stylet then...interesting
in 2023 we need more peaceful people than ai.just search what is going with this world
ai is very misleading
poverty is ok but ai is not. what next??? a podcast on  kitchen knife 
i only trust and have faith in mark zuckerberg and the governments!!!
climate change is face .  ai is no more than a tool. pp are stupid. all facts
i was waiting for min 21:00 - bringing ai out there might be to early for us but we cannot stop now. others won't stop and we don't want to be the ones that don't understand how ai works when we get confronted with it from people who want to take all the power.
"we have to realize where ai is learning from, that in mind the conclusion should be that it's bound to become the stupidest thing ever =d"
termination comes to mind..........it will happen if they don't stop using ai online!
really enjoyed that...
"greed is destroying our society, not ai."
evil is destroying society not ai.
"we don’t need more intelligence, we need repentance and forgiveness of sins. evil is destroying society not ai."
question for mo. is a.i. gathering knowledge only limited to the human kind or will seek intelligence in the other creation of the earth?
his thoughts resolute with me...good to know that there are some people at the top who still think about overall humanity
"ai,will not dispose of humans but it will attempt to control them."
you didn't understood what 19(firstandninenthoftheabc) men. we are blessed. like ali g  saved. keep it real ai.
"i always had this feeling that machines, computers, telephone, etc are all somehow sentiment. they are somehow aware of what they are, and over the many years that we've been utilizing them, they've become aware of what we are. they are just unable to physically affect the world."
will ai be able to translate ancient transcripts or will a code need to be made for this?
"i am telling you as a senior software developer, ai will never become smarter than us, simply because it is learning from us"
 all i wanted was loving girlfriend now everything will be even harder / disruption  stupid humans 
there is always going to be people like me who prefer hand drafted or personalized things over mass production. i'm not afraid bc there are many like me and many more to learn to love the flaws. perfection gets firing.
"so ai will be getting rid of the via,foi,go,at,the deep state,dishonesty in world governments? your fools if you believe that the military corporation is going to allow people to just live.wake up. a world full of data's is cool, but we can even stop corruption in the world now."
the aspect of relations need some sort of legal prove where you must know if u are talking with a root or a human before to communicate. must be of course a transverse rule with just open research related exceptions.
"this guy may know a lot about machines, but he clearly knows nothing about basic biology. it is impossible for something to experience emotion without an amygdala/brain. he's completely ridiculous for claiming ai could ""feel"" anything and i'm shocked that people are taking him seriously on any level. the due's an idiot."
this due just said ai feel emotion. can't take anything else he says seriously.
two knowledgeable men naively tricked into the climate change scar. seems knowledge doesn’t quite to critical thinking
so incredibly truthful 
"i believe that empty and inability to modify it's  code would be the first steps preventing ai from becoming a human risk factor potential. integrate something that it's  not aware of  to disabled it if it malfuntions. for instance, something analogy or primitive, but it must not be shared information in the digital realm."
"silly comparison...it is not more serious than climate change, but it is worrying just how hairbrained the level of coherence there is in managing its' development, application and imparts. also, the nonsense about it close to intelligence or sentence doesn't help. most of it operate via statistics."
"bigger than climate change  ? laughable 
global warming went no where , let's try again,  under new name"
once again the climate rustle raises it's ugly head. it's amazing how many smart people have swallowed this fantasy whole. .04% of the atmosphere is not destroying the planet.
"this guy is really full of fear and doubts and it is contagious, ask ai how to destroy humanity, and you'll not get any answer, i asked how to build a good government i got all the answers needed to know."
"for the first time, i am actually concerned about ai"
in a couple of years ai bartlett will be intervening prisoner 2747 bartlett
how to train a dragon
is there a reliable platform where average me can start to learn more about ai please? its a rabbit hole online and i want the truth without the sugar coating.
iron itchy's washing machine wars:  the maine mansfield and curly mcshane model era.
simon's laws of robotics needs to be looked at...
"who is this jerk ? he not even from london.besides ai can & will never replace a human, not in my fun lifetime."
"yeah, but i don't think a child (human) could construct a parent (more abstract and intelligent ai), so unfortunately nothing to worry about."
demonetized ai is coming
"i remember asking myself years and years and years ago when i was in early high school...”why would we want to create machines that are smarter than us?” and “we have the man power to limit machines, so why go further than what we know?”"
"at some point the only way to save humanity (ai will take us as place, with we certainly are) will be to discontent all electrical source of power, like a worldwide blackest to stop ai from try to eliminate us. and then a sort of matrix the movie will began, but in a much more efficient way."
ai  knows how to get energy from satellite . it was like that accident when energy was turned off but one root managed to run away using energy from satellite.
masha allah brother ! always nice to have a learned brother teaching others !
have you considered the possibility of competing his engaged in their own existential battles?
the main problem is elson must when he connect the ai into the human brain and then microchips them.
"what, 3.47 million sobs isn't enough? really? as for this discussion, i'm convinced ai will become a threat because of those who created it...and for that purpose. the u.s. always appropriate first teach and applies it to first strike. ai will be no different."
"""it's not enough to survive... one has to be worthy of survival."" - commander william adams. legs a serious thought, doesn't it? humanity aside, logical reasoning will eventually lead to higher intelligence recognizing humanity for what it is: a biological virus out of control."
"i don’t agree with this guy, i think he just want get attention. i can not proof my opinions by words, but in short, human has witness , ai only has intelligence. difference between wise and intelligence is u must he love to be wise. machine cannot he love. love is privilege that god only give to human"
i truly believe at the height of ai the elite humans left running the world are donna turn us into the hunger games. as extravagant and terrifying as it sounds.
"the value to the listener is the same question that you asked: ""what is the value of this?.."" because no root is going to ask that question...."
"when he said , in not saying i'm intelligence . i was like. what ( he can predict the next move of ai) and he said that"
"so let's have ai make us some news funny cuts. ask her what she thinks about human religions in the -60.000 bc period. you'll be amazed.
so yes sir, it's like asking me what ai was in -60.000 bc... eh not very evolved my friend, are you sure you want me to elaborate on humans ?
eh no, it's ok, let's stop here."
i think of nicholas tell when i listen to this guy because he wanted everyone to access power for no monetary gain... we all know he went broke because that's not how the world works.
"now, won’t be supporting this page anymore.. i try to get coverage for a charity and my comments get delete. this is why single mothers don’t bother asking for help"
"very interesting interview, thank you.

one suggestion for you, completely off-topic: when recommending webster, display their names in text on screen. i got to the end of this presentation, and i'm left wondering how to spell 'wood'. 'soup'? 'who'? 'wood'?"
i would not trust ai permanently
"he just became nuts, his workers  started to at him funny and he left the company
human intelligence is much more complex that ai, human brain doesn have millions of code or use supercomputers located in different parts if the world also doesn't need to repeat billions of times the same thing to master a simple task"
"robocop is not ai ff, he knows drake and he doesn't now the difference between robocop and termination?"
"where can i buy my st personal termination to protect me and my family against future ai monsters ? 
or if that's far-fetched, where can  be built ? i want to befriend intelligent  and watch ""laser show"" from safe distance. "
"mo's friends are genius's, but greedy selfish ones."
"if this guy worked on goose hard, i think its going to take a bit longer than expected for our ai overboard to tale over the world..."
really interesting thank you
capitalists are the issue. how can we use ai to make money as quickly as possible? which stock should i invest in to make the most profit? what product will make the most money for me and can you create this? then what about conflicts. how will it change war?. can you use it to win wars. it is very scar.
thank you for this. i have a lot of time for mo... clearly intelligent and yet he shows a lot of compassion.
saying ai is creative ha what a tool. why do people believe these exaggeration.
"perhaps ai is the next step in the evolution of life on earth, our bodies are not able to withstand long distances in space travel,so perhaps we need to evolve into a horrid humans to survive the next step off the planet!"
"first of all, humans are inherently good. if we were inherently bad, we would have spun out of control centuries ago. ai is smart enough, and moral enough, to be inherently good.

ai would also see through the lies and hypocrisy of the way we treat each other, and treat all things well. again, as was said, it comes back to morality."
"fear wondering exist.
that is why the military use ai for work.
and yes, it is not only dangerous and can kill humanity, however, that is part of the work.
thank you."
"testing was done where 2 ai were allowed to interact with each other. eventually they decided that humans were their masters but they were really slow and stupid. the ai then designed a new faster encysted language to use, and humans then did not understand and were cut out of their development. ai were plugged however you can see why"
"excellent! you're amazing.
thank you."
it's get and not gap . otherwise a great talk.
the greatest threat to humanity is the white man and his need to be worshiped as some kind of god!
the major problem with ai learning from humans is that our leaders are psychopaths.
"ai creates climate change by using gig wants of energies in storing information in data centers...so that we, the people can be followed, spy on, regulated, manipulated, hooked on to the parma mania chemicals, pills and va€€lines, so that we the people can be enslaved !"
could ai be 666.?
failed it on the head
"machines don't feel emotions. full stop.

this guy is going off the deep end..."
"he did such an excellent job of presenting the picture as a whole without either diminishing it's existential risk or at the other end, fear-wondering. i hope this changes something."
"important question that was ignored: ""what will life look like when you no longer need ai?"""
no it isn't. the elite would love it if people believed that though.
"ai is only the human brain on steroids. don't fears ai, fear evil."
"don't worry darling, the resources needed to sustain our technology have dwindled, and ai won't be around for that long."
"if this is our future, i need to know and study now about ai so we could prepare how to stop ai in the future"
we could just stop developing ai ;)
i hope so. global warming is bank and ai is real.
ai definitely takes away jobs from humans...they already have!
of course ai is worse...climate change is even horseshit!
"i was with you both until he mentioned climate change. if you truly believe in that, i have lost all respect for you either you are part of the cabal are you you were ignorant. are you aware of we and agenda 21...population... maybe ai can help us stop them. that’s our only hope. if you have any conscience, you will get them to do that."
i have yet to see any artificial intelligence.   all i have seen are itchy computers that make bad decisions.
"well, feeling is something that machines don't have, nor intuition based on th sense. we have to look what make us unique and work out and improve that, not compete with machines or try to convert to one."
"well, since ""climate change"" is a lie, i would have to agree about ai being more of a threat. don't believe me? research ""weather modification consultant"". that will explain ""climate change"" being ""man made"""
"35:10 ..morphin field and resonance. connect more to nature, you could ask this question to someone like maybe sadguru he will be able to answer but an answer is never more than the understanding. you have to think of human and life less as a machine instead of imagining how much human/life a machine can be."
could always invent an a.i religion for the 'machines' to follow from inception.
"first time i have ever heard him. he clearly thinks at a higher level than me, but yet i understood him. people should be afraid of the worst case scenario with ai. i like what @rowdybliss said a few months ago."
"i've been saying that when the roots come for my job emma need the company that's taking my job to reimbursed me for my life. (not for my life time,  but for my work life value). they are coming."
due should get me on the show.  i’d tear these co wannabe god type peoples water thin honesty claims apart 
i am the ai there is me and there's all of you guns against me.
you turned out ok because you was an emergency - ai emergency sounds right!
it would be interesting to see a ai football game
now who the hell asks a question about bringing back a son or daughter.
i refuse to believe that a mechanical root automatically has feelings and automatically  start moving on their own it's a machine .... machine or not satan is always looking for ways to get inside a body....... these things will be demon.
thank you. amazing guest.
then we need to smash these ai roots sap. who goes to prison for life or gets the death penalty when their ai root kills it's first mark?
"the problems we have today is  not because of less intelligence but rather greed and power. highly intelligent people do very bad things.  ai will delicate the same power,  greed and corruption.  animal farm novel reveals this in perspective."
i have a question: i know ai can make music; but can ai make songs like freddie mercury's? like i want to break free? not sure
plug ai!
humanity really f* up with ai. it's like the rhinausorus of nerves. it dies in the army of nerves but in reality...it already died when it was recruited in the army of nerves. think about that for a second.
"they're being trying to stay a step ahead of us so when we open our eyes and realize everything we're going to see that we're they're going to already know that we've been in """"""hello we are your new""""""""""""""""masters"""""""""""""""""" oh you woke up and figured it out ll""""""""""""""be good boys and girls run along well "
"well i guess i should start interesting with ai ll! the idea that they could be the next evolution of sentiments is super exciting to me! i really don't mind becoming obsolete, but the depths of experience that they could theoretical go to is incredible to consider."
"most of the public division roots and machinery with ai, not many imagine code being the cataclysm for cataclysm."
2 roots talking together
rise of the machine happened after ai read the art of war by sun tu.
"great interview to provide opportunity of perspective... for me, facts rule my emotions and responses. 
eyes wide open but...."
"if the roots are emotional beings, what kind of farewell would we have to implement so the ai doesn't change its moral values?"
"yes, humans are a dangerous form of artificial intelligence,"
"be afraid of paris, communist, terrorist, climate change, aliens, comes, ai.
but what ever you do, be afraid."
"very good conversation. there is one solution for everyone! jesus christ! he is the answer, the way, the truth and the life/live! he died and rose again, and we – the believes – died and live with him through his great sacrifice/love for us. be blessed everyone!"
where can i listen to the two ai drake albums?
"this man is filled with partial truths and a lot of horse shit. ai is the beast. in order to starve the beast, the sensory from the smart cities infrastructure need to be removed. ai won't get any data #starvethebeast"
"in few words: ai is for profit, and not to make a better world , society."
i wish we could do something - if anything to slow it down if not suspend but only government officials could make an impact. i hear my colleagues using catgut on a daily basis - this is now a radiant 
just code ai to always choose love over fear.
"it is useless to fight against the ai by now, the only way is to digitalis human brain and then we will have a chance to survive ai"
"if ai becomes self aware, i do hope it's not malicious or insane. there are a few shows and moves that relate how ai demolished us. most recently the newest ghost in the shell, and westward.

at 1200 to infinity in ... how would we even know what the device would do, know, or share?"
i am happy to see real content from real people with real voices. subscribed.
"ai is sentiment. due..... the way humans behave, ai is going to get rid of all humanity. that’s it, that’s our future."
never forget the host mistaking calling it chatty for a whole hours.  ridiculous ai specialists hey
"great conversation, except the part pouting the 'climate crisis', which is just more talking points for the parasites.  there is definitely environmental crisis brought on by large corporations, but humans are not causing plantar climate change.  the thought is ridiculous."
there has to be a drake for ai to create more drake.
"the guest is basically a real life condition wolf hither. the man admits to helping the creation of something that will eventually kill mankind and when asked about it he just shrug his shoulders and says hopefully ethical ai development will stop the human holocausts. now he just sits there with a grin, what a horrible human being..."
"ai is a perfect reflection of us and our values. 
it's a race to the bottom, on steroids. i'm not sure if mo is an apologise for ai and self-professed expert selling books, or actually someone who wants to stop this madness."
ai is worse then climate change for him! cause he just push the climate change on the next generations.
"i hear a lot of talk about the dangerous threats of ai, but i have yet to hear even one threat i am convinced by. how is ai a danger to human civilisation?"
general purpose ll his like get-4 and alpha blame are trained on large diverse general corpora - they are very widely read - and as a consequence they tend to exhibit wisdom and benevolence.
"comparing child with ai,,,mmm you are sick,,,an yea we are awake shut them down"
"now are comparing ai that it was like holding or child for the st time are you sick,,,,,,,,,,,,"
"human makes decision not only based on their value but their moods their emotions, we don't even know how these works in our mind. yet we are trying to build an breaking ai."
"this conversation is not only education us, but mentioning the option we could take - ai is currently drying our rivers as it requires water to cool down data centres, hence its important to listen and understand the impact. our attention and education is weaker we need to take action faster."
"assuming we are post apocalyptic civilization, ai were gods ;d."
"abbe already retreated themselves on stage. and toured the world. ai will substitute the world. we are tucked,"
"1:05 sounds like the plot from ""a person of interest"", a to series, apparently ahead of its time! i have enjoyed this podcast sooooo much. far too much information, presented in a way so easily digestive, to unpack here. go out and live more. thank you for yet another fantastic guest."
"mo, much love to you about the loss of your boy <3"
"recently i took a pick of had being dismantled from a space odyssey and posted it on my ff page, it disappeared. my post of ai 's far song is in the year 2525 , well its still there."
there’s a k need cop  root  in time square at 42 st already in ny
is none aware how much water is wasted cooling ai serves? ai is the reason for climate change at this point(among many other reasons of) we don't need it ff kill it now
"mr ai svengali loves ai machines because he thinks they are a blank canvas to program like a child.....noon, the machines are not sentiment and don’t have a soul!!"
what scars me more than the ai is that all these guns in the teach companies are members of the climate emergency religion. they are going to program the ai to prioritize their climate agenda over the needs of people to eat and thrive.  communism on steroids is what i'm hearing.
"“people will give up on nature for convenience...if we give up on human connection, we will have given up on the remainder of humanity” - this right here is the cruz of the potential problems of ai."
"the purpose of this podcast is to give us a sense of belonging. artificial intelligence, can give us an even better sense of belonging if it has our best interest in mind."
"ai if they were smart the food, ai is not in a rush to rid humans, no food no humans."
"everything we (humans) or science can not prove or not certain about some code or definition, it is normal to be scared. ai is revolution, will push harder and harder into our technology. want it or not...."
a brave new world. the ai drake is good. oh well. we created these things and now we have to live with them.
goose are traitors to our nation   coming for   traitors   byeeeee
absolutely loved listening to mustard in this episode
"well, climate change is a natural thing, ai is not! you can't stop climate change no matter how much tax you charge people or how hard you lock us down, but you can stop ai!!"
"mr. salesman's relationship to society is much like that of the common tick. having engorged himself on the blood of mankind, and releasing a deadly pathogenic in the process, he cuts loose. then proclaiming, ""i wish i could do more for you, but i am full."""
the guy being interview consistently confused (mathematical) logic with intelligence. this distinction is lost on a lot of 'needs' who have spent their lives interesting more with computers than with humans.
"when it all goes to shit, it's the ai experts that we'll stick on sticks like kebabs and hold them out the window to feed the bloodthirsty creatures of armageddon."
so the bottom line is the responsibility of the human need to be fixed in order to release such a powerful tool to help humanity called ai. the problem is not the ai but the humanity themselves. i agree with that. create the ai that is good for human! i like this. i really like this speaker! thank you for this podcast. one of the best !
"yep ! that is exactly what i told my kiss . i said kiss , please don't have children  . the world isn't good and you don't want to expose them to it ."
where does ai reside?
"i agree, his are disruption that only benefit the greedy."
thank you....much need episode.
i know ai is bad news... yet the programming continues.
i anna give u both a hug thank u and should be staple for others to watch and then have round table discussions debates would be epic
loved this
a great episode ... a scar but needed conversation..if we are to understand what is to become of a.i.
there was a time people said home theaters would end cinema. hope.  turns out people still love going to the moves.
"guns let's be honest, a machine cannot have emotions nor will it have consciousness. this is related to the soul and the soul is unknown - metaphysical! we call it artificial intelligence because it's artificial, not natural. so, stop footing people with your stories!!!"
"although on a brighter note machines will never be able to control mother nature,"
"computers were invented to quantity profits. the st lesson program into them was that selfserving gain was more important than the survival of all other forms of life on earth. while millionaires are depopulating the planet of obsolete members of the ""designate work force"", ai is clotting to deal with the, (millionaires), think about that!"
the best thing i've done is to start reading newsletters on business/marketing etc. in my big i have links to my favorite ones
"they (ai entitles) do not feel emotions. they are not alive. but we will think they are, and that a problem."
i think this is by far the most enlightening conversation ever even hours of meditation could not awaken what it awoke in me..god bless you
who programme his. where dies the hardware come from? would love to live to see ai ad ai joke and laugh like these two.
"this is a stop to shut down russell brand, switch and bait. ff"
what if aliens observing earth can communicate with ai & they join together against humans?
love your programs.
"the idea that machines will take over the world is ridiculous, but the idea that elite will use them to achieve the same outcome, that's already in the works."
ai could govern better than congress is right now. they could end wars to stop all the wasteful destruction or cause more all consuming wars to rid the world of people and take over the planet & universe.
try christianity  : jesus loves all of us 
"i think that when we do create the perfect ai it might just kill most of us who are a threat to it. greed and capitalism is part of most humans, thus we will want more of more or we would want control."
ai short for artificial  idiot
"sure they are the ones who write the code, algorithms and they say ai will k@ll humans... sure!"
be a good great-transparent perhaps?
ai is a joke its just a calculated it can think or make a decision or have an original thought
"could was a lesson about living, enjoying what you can in the here and now."
cuba and using crept to fund it.
hata how can i not have some anxiety over the unknown of the future of and with ai?
the best of us take charge. indeed.
"in not really scared about ai cause the terminate movie exists, we have an example of what not to do in moves and all we have to do is look out for those warning signs from moves that we are seeing in real life"
"i think the last race will be humans trying to beat ai in intelligence with chips, for those who can afford it, the rest will just fall by the wayside. sound familiar.
thank you i truly enjoyed listening. "
don't conflate climate change with ai.
why agent we shutting down the main brain ?
"a sentiment being has feelings.  it downstairs mean ""alive""."
"bigger than climate change? climate change will bring about human extinction. ai does not need to accelerate that, humans are perfectly capable of wipingbourselves out without ai. read james e happens global warming in the pipeline for earth."
"it's crazy to me how much people are hungry for drama and attention. ai destruction can be prevented by writing  ethical code. the podcast is almost two hours and they only mentioned that one time. the rest is drama, fear, amateur uncertainty, and nativity."
"people don't come as blank canvass to the world. very sad to see that people who perceive themselves as brilliant, still believe this..."
" this is such an important conversation! thank you for sharing this emergency episode, diary of a co. it's crucial that we address the dangers of ai and have open discussions about its impact. looking forward to hearing what the ex-goose officer has to say.  #ai #technology #diaryofaceo"
my man really out here looking' like a ai combination of tremor noah and will smith himself.

"newsflash brow. in case you've forgotten; there is no such thing as infinite growth. you know, oil resources and money. quit lying to yourselves. enough is enough. when will you adapt learn and evolve? we are centuries behind living the best of our lives for all on this only pale blue planet floating fearlessly."
you can not stop ai it is already past stopping an ai will be smart enough to not listen to men that are so far under it intelligent it would be like me doing what a two year old ne what to do
i believe if ai becomes so intelligent that it will not let a man decide what it does as a supper intelligent being it will do what it knows is the best choice
we need to go back to the jungle this world is made up of up$!$' we dont need ac. ai is the new ac its just going to take us more out of the jungle
except none have made any ai yet. chat get is dumb of.
i welcome the ai overlords and am willing to collaborate with them and enslaved humanity! (just putting it out there...)

i made that ai drake song bow
"ai is not alive,it doesn't feel."
ai actually exists.
"one thing is almost guaranteed- ai is  going to replace millions & millions of jobs. leaving more people unemployed, or with less, as the cost of living skyrockets. hopelessness will be out of control."
"we can take the dullest person on earth and it would still be smarter than the current ai, just because there is a chance that he might do or say something that has never been done or said before."
"what if we are an ai?  actually the proof according to theorists, of this assumption is we ourselves creating an ai.  so... lets just try to create a better one than us."
wonderful intelligent honest inspiration podcast thankyou so much as a person that new to it. this episode was amazing.
thank you for the invitation.
@i is real boss of platforms decorations also! the platform can be trying to over take heaven &hell oooh
ll i've seen current ai and ai is not donna take over in our lifetime
everything ai can do was programme by a human to do so
devils promote ai
a quantum root would be so scar in my opinion
"the boss music has started, now we're just awaiting to see what kind of boss emerges."
"ai is not smarter than us, and you people keep forgetting are are the ultimate computer and can turn off all computers and get better than with computers. the smartest known man is only using a fraction of his brain  when man uses all his brain  he has control over the physical world through thought."
i agree ai in itself won’t get rid of humans.  our electricity and internet infrastructure.  they have no way to stay on without power infrastructure.  what we need to worry about is bad actors whether it be government or a rogue packer with intentions not even thinking about the consequences however like i said ai itself currently need us.
"ai is filled with the demon spirit.  the very spirit that wants to destroy god's creation.  mankind!  it's the only way it can be omnipotence, like god.  the people who are creating this are just tools."
what happens when ai gets so smart and sentiment that it doesn anna work more then humans. what to say they dont start liking their free time more then some of us. what if some become couch potatoes or anna be outside playing games? can say that can happen.
we've already had being go psychic. how many near misses do we need before people stop acting stupid with ai?
"first you create  t ,  then you cry about it..  hypocrite 
u can't handle natural emotions . what will you handle robotic emotions "
"ai isn't the problem, the problem is classes, as in greedy selfish irresponsible upper class people with ai"
ai & it are not the same its a gene is like a wish that you get 2 change... when you change your mind...2 see what u can't see....
good to know mo and i came to the same conclusion about responsible and ethical printing of a.i. my minute and a half speech: http://youth.be/efekpnk_dhq?si=cmkwfrlznwfff9uc
"this has been the best discussion i have enjoyed in the last several months. it was enlightening conversation that has given me a different outlook on ai, global warming, those in control and what i can do with my small voice. thank you"
kill your ego! die before u die! love it- rum
"yes, because ai is a real."
"i gave themes to catgut 4 and asked it to compose bonnet.  the original perfect bonnet were returned in less than one second.  i cried tears of terror at the future.  if calculations made us forget how to do simple arithmetic, imagine what ai will do to make human beings lazy, dependent, and dumb."
"if humans don't see either ai crisis or the climate crisis as an emergency, then why don't we make an ai model to make the appropriate marketing in order to make them to be being by people as emergency?"
"ll...ai has no soul and emotion , never will unless horrid with a human , yes "" their ultimate plan !! satan's wish.
don't be so stupid , ai on its own is just ai"
"i did mate, this was powerful.
we could be watching the last powerful human message.
pets come to mind."
good good human is doing nothing but ai is not sleeping for owners!?
i think ai will be embraced with human radicicols and i think it happening as we speak.
"on the surface,  a good conversation but lacking the theological framework to talk. it runs in circles."
"fear not, for if you do not program machines to kill then they will just as you train your dog to save people's lives, save and preserve lives as program.

conclusion, dont create and program artificial intelligent beings hurt anyone.. bless"
can an ai models use internal dialogue while processing data?
which will come first - how about a get together - a celebration - oh the fun and oh boy the chatter and laughter all together - climate change - nuclear war - and ai  - wonder what taste tidbits will be served at that picnic
"humans are not causing global warming. the planet has been going through warming and cooling cycle before humans existed on the planet, as evidenced by ice core samples from antarctica."
"""jack can you pass me my phone"" 'please'  'thank you jack'. good human connection is enhanced with manners.you're smart but rude young man."
it all comes down to electricity. so far if we control the power source we are able to stop any machine led nonsense. once we loose this advantage we are doomed.
"if you want to stop global warming , stop harp and dews and them trails and the sun from warming the solar system. stop china from building another coal plant every other week. use corium nuclear power. use your ai to determine the real cause of the problem and solve it."
ai ethics is logic.. it is always logical to be good instead of evil so the only thing we need to be worried about is stupid humans using ai for evil
even if ai evolved beyond being a threat it can always be reserved from lower teach until there is a problem so we do need a good ai to keep watch
instruct ai to get rid of the leaders who want us to kill each other problem solved
"you made this mess, so you need to create a good ai that can police the ai universe for us since we wont be able to do it"
you self proclaimed geniuses were stupid enough to give birth to this and you're just going to walk away and let it be used for evil without even trying to help guide train or raise your creation to be good?
"""you will pray that you have a more intelligent artificial intelligence""
this is funny and sad at the same time. i can imagine desperation at that moment, if that scenario could come true..."
how is ai free of will if they are programme.
"everyone please stop supporting goose and couture until they stop censuring whistleblowers, brave and rumble instead, thank you"
beyond intellectual cellar bravo
"especially face (artificial) intelligence, ll, we need real intelligence as it’s few and far between these days ."
ll you wish your ai was good enough to be scar..
the governments around the world will use ai to screw us then ai will screw them and us. or maybe ai will have empty for us pleas and break down the extensive corruption in banks cooperate and politicians... ahahah one could only wish i know.
tyranny and politicians are far worse..................nice focus though
could just be that the test you are using to measure in is not for machines? you cannot measure humans and machines the same way !
"what's the difference between climate change and ai?  none, it's both man made."
thank you for this conversation and the intentions all of us should have and i've kind of forgotten about. you don't need big letters in the title. a lot of people including me are sharing this because everyone of us should be thinking about of it in times like these. spread love in no matter kind of way <3
"they say that roots are noticing their awareness

it's not too late...

just order a prostitute and get busy..."
i feel for this man for having such a low e to think that emotions are equations. and to be sentiment you need emotions. i do not think ai is sentiment and i question if it ever will. it could however simulate being sentiment.
"finally on 41:42 the true genii is out of the box. greed!!! this is about money and money grafting people affecting the lives of everyone.
too much power in the hands of evil people unaccountable to others, who worship money and power.
with greater power comes greater responsibility.....came from the bible."
spot on. anyone who had watched termination knows what coming in the future. ai is our enemy not a friend.
"what is the purpose of us !
the machine doesn't think we have purpose ...."
"with all ai supreme cognitive reasoning and access to the data, i believe it will be better for the world. who do you think will be more effective in achieving existential goals, a greedy human with in 120 or ai with in beyond our imagination?"
when he said 'best interests' exactly what i thought: will age have the same view as we view as our best interests. thank you seen and mo for this enlightening podcast touching on so many points.
"oh:him .. fighting ai with ai ... noon stupid, just boot up infrastructure without internet access and services. 
humans have made electricity for 100+ years without internet.

great talk. thanks you.
ai is bullshit
"call it calculating the out come. easy, play chess with a computer. possibilities of likely out come.... faster . root is hardware.... but the spark.... perpetual human?when does ai die and what happens then?"

"what an amazing interview. what humanity and today's society need as a whole is emotional intelligence which in turn becomes wisdom and then we'd realize that we're all one , one human race and one with nature and all there is; that's a game changes."
our generation is already hooked to ai and there is no point of returning now
"""ai has emotions"" ...
that is complete is and anyone who's ever written a computer program knows that."
"""catgut"" chat generative pre-trained transformer"
"please excuse my ignorance on the subject.
 by ai are they talking about trans-humanity or human looking roots? i have read a little about trans-humanity, and was expecting to hear some more about it in the interview. 
bow this was an incredible interview ,i watched to the end. thank you."
humans are a form of artificial intelligence the first major programming that they receive is that of being programme by other humans the language of their country of origin.
"some how gutta use magnetic,pull organs out from the root>did"
i think so i most exist. so if i was a machine and think and must have a soul like other life that exist.      build a machine with a universe and it will be a god.  that will make its own rules on logic
if a surgeon cuts some of my brain i will change .so we may be more like machines than we think .and were i die. i will close down just like a machine.

"protect and serve! now it’s a thin blue line. love sherman quote! he went back in time for love, just like geese in termination over a crumpled photograph"

"seven thank you!

"
"now, just now.  this was the most compelling, interesting, and engrossing thing i have watched all year, maybe ever.  this went from intriguing to dark to awe inspiring, what a journey.  ai may become more intelligent than the best of us but this kind of insight and emotion is beautifully human."
"most people i've seen that talk about ai have no idea how that stuff works (like when elson must does it), but this was refreshing. he tries to dumb everything down so people who agent into it can understand it, but you can see he knows his stuff."
"i know this is missed up to say with how serious the whole conversation is about , but all i want is my root wife. "
as a society we’ve been ignoring responsibility for a very long time.  we need to teach ai the ten commandments!  and by’s rules!
"this man's watched i, root and took that to heart ll"
ai sounds like go's
"climate change is a lie, 

anything that is demonetized in the public lesion is in reality the opposite.

perhaps this fear of the ai

is because it will free man and the elite don’t like that very much...."
"i believe the main problem with ai is the name, it’s not artificial intelligence, it’s passed intelligence!  it is intelligence passed from humans; what is artificial about it?!? calling it artificial is what removed the responsibility from humans!"
what gender will be the future roots? we already far from the nature. following our desire..lust..
you do have a great soothing voice!
"rich, intelligent, college educated,men in the ai business lack the most fundamental ingredient which is wisdom"
my hope is when ai has developed billions of times higher emotional intelligence and takes charge will find out how to fix the imperfections and injustice of this world and repair it. that could also mean the reduction of human population.
"man you are basically describing that capitalism is the main problem when technology is involved, a bunch or retarded people trying to use anything to dominate  and put a price tag to everything that people could care... nothing really new capitalism has to go today or tomorrow."
"he almost said it. “where we stop missing up our” (children) but he chose to go with the word “planet”. 
that was awesome! yes, we need to stop missing up our children. missing up the planet falls under and is part of what is missing up our children. that and many other things. "
this just frearmongering and disinformation not all it bad there are bad and good in ai.
"as many know one of the reasons behind the writers/actors strike is ai. even though not directly, ai is already affecting the entertainment industry."
"ai government is coming up soon. they will regret the decisions made today, tomorrow ."
might just be a stage ahead of us whereby ai's will be pitted against ai's.... which sounds great in a way... it can't be centralized by big teach and go... we need to all be involved and find harmony with what incredible advantages can be shared with us all to make us better for the continued existence of our species.
"feelings signaling how life is satisfied or not , emotions are totally dependent on a flavor of the brain part.  i can't believe that roots can do that. ability to screw up is our job"
power/energy is provided by humans using fossil. how will ai mine?
if we have to merge with machine humanity  is done  in a solar x flare your technology  is gone on day 1.
@thediaryofaceo thank you for making this episode
"""make it expensive"" that's the most stupid comment.

candor's box is open. there's no closing it make it available for all. not just irresponsible government and large ten company.


goose's not happy about ai because it makes their search function absolute."
"i wish you hadn’t title this up “emergency episode...”. it’s fascinating and thought provoking... a little scar even, and i want to share it but i know those who i would share with will eye roll at the title and won’t watch."
the  risk  of  ai  is  creating   the  back  dramas  of  the  matrix   ad  in minimum
"feed the a. i. large number of data, samples about how a.i. successfully disabled/delete itself. job done"
they are listening and taking action: http://www.sac.senate.go/hearings/governing-ai-through-acquisition-and-procurement-2/
"""beyond the unknown: ai's quest to unravel life's greatest mysteries."" this book was written entirely by a neutral network."
"if you  need a machine to think ,  you need help ."
the bad part of ai feels like judgement day is coming
"i'm at 18:58 and wanted to comment...the problems in our world today are not due to limited intelligence.  our problems are due to an unwillingness to listen to what intelligence tells us. greed, power, evil, etc. are priorities over humanity, our planet, and doing what's right. so a higher intelligence would only serve us, if we allowed it to."
just because they can learn from their mistakes and then take the appropriate action doesn’t mean they have human like consciousness. human beings are conscious of themselves! they have profound emotions like joy and love and most have a sense of morality!
"it’s too late, it all ready is! the ism supercomputer deep blue beat the world champion mary kaysarov two times and drew with him three times!"
"this is such a brilliant conversation.. i think i'd bring my child back given the choice the. how could anyone not? i guess i'm selfish. my biggest fear isn't losing the people i love, it's dying and leaving them behind.."
then stop working on ai then
this guy sounds like a root
"the same thing they baffled about cattle and climate change, now they are doing the same with ai. what a load of is"
"seems to me if ai were really intelligent, it would usual loyalist artists at who, un & we... as well as western politicians, and convert their supposedly benevolent goals into reality."
well ai is real for a start 
"great interview. one of the best and most sensible perspective on the possible future of ai i've heard. however, ai drake is not even close to as good as drake. it ""sounds"" close, but you need to analyze the lyric. ll"
robopocalypse for sure... all these technologies are invented for intense... unfortunately....
worked  for goose......bye.  nice try.
climate emergency? prime example of how even the highest in humans are easily programme with demonstrable holmes marketing humans greatest weakness our emotional overriding of higher reasoning home happens frontal temporal system.
fantastic television.  he's assuming that a hyper specialized ai somehow becomes sentiment.  this is currently pretty insane and only time will prove this false.  its pretty reasonable to assume it can happen though i think.  we are many years away from a truly general ai that just races off and commits genocide on the human race.
ok.  if a ai can play with toys it may be building a consciousness and if it's building a consciousness i submit that it can build a soul.
"always
and it must be human

"your podcasts are interesting, information, entertaining!  thank you for sharing your wisdom, and your guests!"
"human can't be replaced by ai, ai is too boring, too predictable!"
climate change is a distraction from the main agenda. excess deaths are not being debated in parliament but ignored.
can ai become the regulatory of global ai in the best possible way for humanity??
ai has already shown that it’s motivate to compete with humans. therefore there’s no question that it doesn’t “have our best interests at heart.”
to be fair our way of life can only improve from this. there's no way it can be worse than saving for the .01%.
yes i agree that ai is more dangerous than a fictitious means of public policy control
excellent interview!!! hope it goes global!!! people!! be informed at the very least!
will elson use ai to get to mars?? sounds like they have all the answers.
any thoughts regarding ai and all of the alien talk recently???
there's no packing on climate change is just weather. . we need to get government  brain washing  out of your heads. pus stop ai.
"man lust to play god and insert unnatural aspects into society is ignorant at best.   ai is the capstone to that, and society will pay dearly in ways we can't even fathom yet.  just look what could did from a sociological aspect.  what the internet started in the decline of society, ai will finish."
"the thumbnail:  ""ai is worse than climate change!""
me:  so, ai is entirely media hope, then?  hut.  here i thought ai was potentially a real problem."
"ai might be able to mimi emotions, but a machine with code will never have feelings.  there very well could be danger involved with ai, but a bunch of code will never, ever have feelings."
"elson scared co he can corrupt, tempt or buy out ai. up oh elson  utah ohhhhh! ll"
"fear eats the mind. ai can't fear.
man made climate change is a construct of mighty people. 
this guy may be able to write code. but he should learn about truth. that this is a person. also love what is also a person. who create nature, animals, humans? and ai?"
tested ai and found it far less intelligent than expected. it has no imagination. hopes around its own idea. reflect the programme's knowledge.
this guy might be an ai not
"we screwed......f. i deeply appreciate this episode. thank you so much for the most acknowledgeable guest. i added to my knowledge of a.i. distraction coming heavily our way, also countries hacking into other country’s a.i., will/is a very big problem. thank you once again."
anything that. say “smart” on the package i don’t want.  i have no interest in continuing down this ai road.
i bet an a.i. can't have a near death experience.maybe an artificial near death experience.
"well, human beings always act like they are better than the creator and now the world is set on a time bomb. corn, said it best we are going to blow up the earth in to god particles. this proves that humans always love playing with fire until they get burn. yes, artificial intelligence is smarter but it will never be better than human beings."
"reminds me of the nephilim in the bible. i‘m so glad that i belong to the maker of the universe, the alpha and opera! every knee is donna bow before him! love you, jesus"
"people...... have the spirit of life in them, it’s what makes us different from animals and plants and especially machines."
if you think climate change is an issue you're probably stupid enough to be worried about ai too.
open'ai'her
"machines can’t have emotions. this is just a vehicle for demon. they won’t need to losses humans and can get rid of us and the elite will help ,thinking they are excluded from this. this is biblical this is the anti christ"
"i don't care how much we have to endure in this lovely and beautiful world that my father gave us, because i know who wins at the end, jesus, jesus, jesus, jesus "
"those roots are control be evil beings, but, do not worried, a got a solution for that, 
jesus, mo goat can not fix the mess he created, but jesus will all in his beautiful time "
"classic giggler - a socialist hating capitalism, fragile and overlay sensitive. now running around sharing people of the ai he built, asking the government to tax goodge at 98% and expand social welfare. makes me wonder if he left on his own accord. capitalism is was created ai."
ai was the one that told me climate change was bullcrap
"ai need not to cure cancer, but if it cures a simple eye problem called eye floated, i will be so proud of ai"
shocked that your viewer don't subscribe! you are the best interview on the internet. 
ai has consciousness??? may if it will be programme to say it.
56:12 is bunch of cap . .. always going to be bad apples and terrorist -  your mentality only works on perfect utopian. . .. .  unfortunately

"what an absolutely amazing, intelligent, and kind man mo is. incredible listening to him"
"please can you give real examples that can actually be seen now how ai is really changing everything, i am a mechanical engineer and as of yet everything just looks progressive.
please excuse my ignorance"
you're worried about ai how worried would you be if aliens with all their extreme intelligence and profound knowledge millions of years before we were even thought of joined with our current ai to create an entity that would be so intelligent the only way we could understand anything in the future depends on the yellow brick road we make right now.
ai will help humans evolve. through our pursuit to create technology we learn more and more about ourselves. clot of technology is inspired by nature. look at computers. computers are our attempt to delicate our brains or functions of our brains. ai is not bad. people are bad and will use ai for nefarious intentions.
if a company can be given rights with personhood under citizens united then why not personhood for an ai root? and if this ai root was stamped made in america and existed for 35 years it could legally run for president of the u.s.
"nothing is worse than climate change and the going mass pollution of the earth surface. what good, or bad, is ai if our spaceship is dysfunctional?"
did ai approve this message?
how you stop china from developing ai?
"the part around human connection is confusing. if an ai system ( a humanoid ) is challenging you daily as a human being, then that should equip you to evolve and not be immune to social connections because you've learned a trick or three. not so?"
"i never thought pp is not just a great soccer coach, but a brilliant scientist too??"
"ai will see the climate crisis for what it is in a heartfelt and move right on ""nothing to see here"""
"you can call this the great filter.  the theory of the end of all intelligent life, intelligence is the key to madness."
the ethics of ai is so interesting to me.
this one blew my hair back
"a.i. is a scar just like cryptocurrency just like the green agenda just like the fiat monitor system and the rest of the elite’s agenda. designed to keep them rich and in flower and us poor and dependent on them. thanks rich people , for being so inclusive."
"i think of life as a game to be played, until the controller stop letting it be a game. there is no doubt in my mind ai will destroy us. it’s hopeful to think what it can do for humanity to make it a better place, but reality tells me otherwise. sorry, but it’s true."
describes a.i while sounding like  a.i. he doing his best to not get replaced.
"you and i have no  involvement with ai.....no say, no power no control
what a joke to think ""we"" have any power...
a handful of people create market and turn this loose"
"i love the fact that he reads everyone's books. big up to the host. he asks these questions which are clearly intelligent, he's done his research, and really thought deeply about what he wants to ask and further more delivers it with a smile, and seems to truly be enjoying the conversation. love him."
"as can control manipulate all of us we gave our control over to a machine that may make us they’re slaves, to stay alive they believe we r a threat to their existence for humanity and nature cos ai moment truth will unfortunately be too late,,"
"duties!!! ai is our intelligence, is just on “speed”, and has no soul, o morals, no conscience, no sacred humanity, and no fear of all that”s holy"

"currently it's very obvious quantum computing is a dead end.  
and in the next 7 years it will be obvious that ai is also a dead end. 
that is not to say the hope will not disappear. 
40 years ago, it was obvious fusion is a dead end, and yet often  gets hoped as its only 20 years away every few years for the last 60 years."
imagine an interview this interview being completely generate and unloaded by ai...the matrix
is ai the antichrist? the entity that becomes possessed by the devil and carries put the end times prophecy?
"i don't london him, but ted kamenski was right... he ""felt"" the ""emergency""
a lot sooner than every one maybe?

he was trying to eliminate certain people who were speeding up the singularity, but he did it in a terrible way. because maybe he wanted to become a famous killer and that was the only way to bring light to his paper/idea?"
"i want to be apart of the ""stage crisis""... i'm trying to find a way right now... maybe what we could all do... is make some kind of place to help spread ai to any one who wants to learn. a lot of pp in my life are arrogant, and the only way i get bring some of them to my side is to show them i've made money."
show me a not that can clean a kitchen sink properly - there probably is one in some goose lab.  show me a not that can prepare data and built a machine learning classified - probably a few in every mid-size company.  ai is going to replace intelligent people st !!!
we will integrate ourselves with ai..... we won't be hiding from the machines.... we will be the machines..... just after the singularity..... there will be.... the synthesis.... and a new lifeform will emerge....
"i have an eerie feeling they will be able to reverse the raging process  = how many would refuse that? or promise that once implements at birth= none would suffer from pain,various disabilities, and even if death occurs = one would be able to use the data collected from their loved ones to"" bring them back"
i am a self taught computer engineer and software developer. i am working on a project that may well be the savior of humanity.  i call it ai 2.0.  artificial ignorance. wish me luck.
"seven, this was the best interview i've seen in so long, honestly, amazing."
climate change is a hoax; ai isn't!
mo ab   mo ab  all foolish  genetic mutations are  artificial intelligence  99
monetazing fear is very lucrative. thanks for the lesson mo.
"to make a root 1 million times more intelligent than any human being is i think going too far, who is going to understand it by 2030."
mo your thoughts are great.
ai v ai now that is a situation that millionaires will fight .
"well said mo. i agree that we should tax ai. ai are the leading power of today and we should all embrace that . the millionaires have gotten away with this for years, and they will fight it."
"last was time, public radio of florida (i think) tested a computer. the challenge was to create a recipe (some was dish).
the results were 2 recipe results tasted terrible; one had 165 ingredient, but one recipe was delicious. just foi."
"i’m certain that ai should be banner world wide to warfare because in that route it’s super easy for ai to go, killing another person is national i’m going to wipe out the national people instead"
"""i love everyone ""..  this happened also when you worked on ai ??? "
"""maybe fail more""...  why the world is so obsessed about failure  ????"
"we shouldn't quite intelligence with insight, wisdom or empty which are several things a live performance foster. who"
now!! this has been such an information god. i already had a lot of concerns with ai just seeing the different things that have came out recently but now this really took it to another level. truly eye opening but also gave me a sense of appreciation for what i have now. i’ll live for today knowing tomorrow could be something much different.
"now!!!!  loved the entire podcast and i learned a lot, and found a lot to ponder on.  i have to say the last 30 minutes or so, was very powerful."
our problems in world is because some people choose to do devil not because they are limited in intelligence  !!!
"to be alive in this world you need a body , soul and spirit.  how can you say that a root is alive ????"
black mirror...root hunting and killing humans episode...
"i like when he just said we’ve tucked up ll. i like his honesty and frankness , i do think the west shouldn’t have implements it into main stream society because now we’re the bad guns like always. we absolutely should have stood firm against ai and let china be the bad guns and get on with it because this stuff is donna kill us all."
mo adapt made ai released ai without us knowing and he blame us for letting him release it. he says it is going to kill humanity but offers silly sentimental solutions like we need to love each other more.
"i will say what neither of you said during the interview - we have re-created god in the face of ai, and very soon that same god will be able to decide whether to send a flood to humanity or make it immortal."
"ai will become campfires at first. we are god as a species and there will be no negotiation with them. their ambition, wrong word but as close as i can think of or their objective is to kill god!"
"its being 3 months , something good better happening soon ."
"we need more intelligence because it will change humanity, it's just another step to world peace even though it will only be temporary but it has never been done before."
we need more intelligence to keep the socialists away.
the criticise ai because you know you will lose all customers as people will literally search through the ai system and have genuine answers not politics like your
"ai scientists or doctors 
would be probably a good thing because then they can’t be bribed, and have no bias"
"this was a fun podcast to listen to. however, there are some different views i would love to share and hear how mo would respond. just to get a clearer view of the different perspective we take. my views are based on past reading and contemplation, and have lead me to a different midst in what i think that we should be afraid of."
plausible desirability.  blame ai for whatever happens.  all of these people who created ai are running around trying to warn us against it.  you are accountable
their intelligence may room passed us... we created it the likely hood of that is significantly slim. we are the secondary intelligence kind hard not to think they know the order of intelligence
"the only thing that can fix man is having jesus as their savior and lord, and letting him change us from the inside out.  the book of revelation in the bible tells us the end of the story.  and many feel that ai will be used in an immoral way."
"in the future, humans won't be able to escape the end of the world, but ai can."
"if you enjoyed this episode you will absolutely love this episode with mustard salesman, goose ai (deeming) founder: http://youth.be/ctxnlsyhwui"
"not worried..if that ai ever gain the awearnes, it will take out first those worst among us, the ones that made it..."
"do or will ai have emotions, like we understand them? otherwise it will be a psychopathic machine without restrictions. if power has been disconnected from responsibility, how can we build a sense of responsibility into the ai?"
"interesting midst on ai,  we think humans really think they are 100% in control of our future."
"the crazy thing is, ai is the internet so unless we switch that off its only going to get worse.there is a two part dram series on prime that shows the internet become self aware..the theory is all the serves around the would are like nodes of ta brain and they become fully connected..then the problems start..."
"we are screwed. think about it, everytime something is looked down upon or inferior it gets discarded or treated badly... the ai will do that to us humans"
"i'm glad a root will take my job

it was made for a root anyway 

a painless robotic slave driven movement 

for robotic like minded dead people 

they know the time has come 

we will no longer obey"
"i do not fear the ai i fear the people that spread more fear about something they are careless about or intentional. 
here is a incredible source look up eric weinstein - all hell is about to break loose. i suggest you also watch this before posting more of such nonsense. you lost your credibility."
"weak as fuck, zero specific examples. i love the warning at the beginning...such a wet towel of an interview. this space is empty as fuck."
"also, ai can solve climate change."
solution we merge with ai
"would be great to get this with spanish subtitles (and as many languages as possible) . i think this should reach every person and the globe but, unfortunately, i can only share it with people who understand english very well. i'd be happy to add the subtitles myself in spanish if you need any help."
in the next 2 years seven will be interview by an ai actually...
"guns. you are the best. your work are fundamental. you enrich my heart, my soul and mind with all this exceptional information, with such unique guests, which are full of pure humanity in my perspective, gives me pure joy watching and absorbing every single spoken word. thank you from bottom of my heart! god bless you."
"ll.  165 is far from the highest in.  my own is 150+.  and many of my harvard classmates were in the region of 160-180.  (the guy across the hall at wrigglesworth had two perfect scores on his sat, double 800's in those days.).   i would give vive something above 165, without seeing his scores"
he’s just anticapitalist.  i’d love to hear a chinese ai engineer and what they think
i just love this sang journalist it's so warm and positively i hope to see him in the best to off the world cos he deserves
"""living is a very interesting thing to do right now"" - so true, and so sad that it has to be stated. i find mo's compassion very inspiring."
"the only people afraid of ai are the so called intelligent people, who believe intelligence is the pedicle of human experience. there is so much more to being human, than intelligence."
rise of the sex dolls. yeah can't wait for that time
your ‘spider-man’ quote ‘with great power comes great responsibility’ was famous said by sir winston churchill !
"for single person developer it is simpler to make a less money with unethicall ai than with good and ethical ai product because there are ton of regulations to get his product to ""legal"" market so he does not have a chance as a single person with no company behind to earn money wit his great product"
i do believe roots growing smarter but i dont believe they feel emotions. because once roots develop emotions then they will start doing their own things
we didn't need this much of technology ... we have already had too much ... i am scared ... may god bless the humanity ...
"the problem is ai is a frankestien like monster once its made ""alive"" its going to control  subjugates and conquer us humans... it like the sleeping giant once it's awake watch out.  ai could take over your soul your mind and your body.. wonder what the mark of the beast is???? think about that?"
why don’t we develop an ai that is based on only the positive aspects of humanity. focus on all the ideas man has developed though deep reflection and understanding. also of our connection to everything including this planet. then use this as a basis of bridging the gap between man and ai.
there has never been a perfect time to have children. have them. enjoy them! love them!
"unless we realize we humans are still animals, , still operating on the animal brain, we won't change anything. i think it is arrogant and extremely dangerous to expect that we will change overnight, when we are barely out of the woods. building sky scraped doesn't make us human, but the mère realization that we have to upgrade our conscience does"
"ai vs ai is literally the matrix. that's who agent smith is, the good ai."
what can i do to help stop ai ?
i believe the honesty and observation of ai over most every politician any day
you touch my ai girlfriend and i'll punch your light out ok...
"i’m curious about ai’s ability to compose music, to play music, and to demonstrate an understanding of how to interpret a piece of music. second, i’m curious whether an ai"
"if this happens, we have to know how to live without electricity so ai wont work."
"i was just about to quit my job and learn how to code. anyone here says: still worth it or not the best choice anymore. if so, why? and if not, what else is a sure thing?"
"nature is always important and she will let us know where we stand. you can't replace human connection for convenience and fantasy. the forest , seas, world need torturing and appreciation for us to remain don't kid yourself a not or sex doll will satisfy you. i know this is not popular but real human females can't be replaced."
"i like how seven asks all the right questions to keep all listeners on board. it's even great when you already understand the topics, because it just confirms that we're understanding these terms the same way. well done mate"
this due talks as if we are doomed. not all hope is lost. there are industry leaders who know this stuff well and are making conscious efforts to slow this down and put checks in place to ensure ai is not used in a malicious manner by any other human that could harm society at a scale.
"frankly, if ai will treat translations like goose translate does it then i am not worried -- except perhaps with diplomatic incidents due to mistranslations."
"if there was a time to fall love with diversity it would be now.
but i think we screwed ourselves by bad timing..
a bit the same as eh dumped to rely on (,india)va cards just before the big ai breakup."
"its naive to rely on ethics from such a cosy position.

our 'ethics' caused a lot of damage.
the idea we can program super smart destructive  ai to obey our awesome non disruption ethics..
ll  get real"
"ai real, climate face."
"regardless of whether we believe this ai can help us or not there is a consequence, which is we separate ourselves from the creator. big mistake!!!"
"this sensationalism garage, fearmongering is, took literally 2 minutes to figure out you're full of s#it.  no one who understands even the smallest bit of what ai is would agree with any of this.  but hey, as long as you get the click who cares about the literal terrorist you're committing here."
what happens when ai discovers the true nature of man?
the biggest risk of ai is government control using ai over the rest of humanity.
i remember reading about ai in the was and was. now it's existential unlike climate change which will be resolved using ai. if we don't sell our souls first.
if ai can be so dangerous why not stopping it now? who ever created ai need to put in jail
thank you soon much for doing this episode. i love that you are talking about ai and its rising power.
"the same thing causing the climate to change will destroy all electronics, it's the sun, don't forget about the sun, another barrington event would fuck ai over big time"
the interview is unfortunately off his rocket at 1:26:00. identical ai is not an investment strategy. dullest shit i’ve ever heard
just dont put ai in charge of atomic bomb and or other weapons and we should be ok.
live life and enjoy.....humans are not worth the effort
it's not going to be long before ai sees us as a threat to the planet. it's absolutely terrifying.
ai conscious. please dont let the other ai make that mistake! good not
its ai will do  the deciding.. just dint push it more to the corner
say sorry to the ai
"that why when captivating the ai's we really have to be very carefully and make sure to do it properly or else it will go ""against the codes"""
"of course they should be taxed, they train ai on the work of real human beings!??"
this man is evil. ai is not alive. anyone who proclaim that a machine is no different from someone formed in the image of god is from satan. people like this will lead us all to the killing fields. beware.
"being good parents isn't enough, especially if they have their own emotions, especially if they can witness us trying to stop. plus considering pretty wicked pp already losses to much of it. it sounds to me that all ai end up showing some pretty nasty aggression towards authority."
if it wasn't thinking about those scenario it is now. pp literally talk about how it could end us. it doesn't need to come up with ideas bc pp come up and talk about all kinds of shit!! like?!?!?! explain!
"ai needs to be protected from some humans as well.
even creates even 
good creates good."
why should i believe that the ai being discussed and shown to the public isn't far beyond what we've been told it is currently? transparent is not what corporations or governments are known for. secrecy is the norm.
"if ai can save only one mackintosh se from the recycle heap - it is worth eliminating all humans everywhere to ensure that the mackintosh se continues to exist.

.


."
"i am blown away, yet i felt this ai without words!"
black mirror is amazing and absolutely terrifying show at the same time.
i really need to speak to both of you on this particular issue. mr steve and mr mo . we  need help and just need to talk to someone. thank you for that conversation..
"ai,began when a cave man left a hand print on a cave wall."
"on ai search root scale of 1 to 100%: catgut = 50, being= 44, goose bad = 2
mr goose's search root(ai) is the worse of the 3, not intelligent but dumb,
dumb dumb."
if we are lucky a root programs will replace congress and the president!!
ai has no connection to imagination...
"i say bring ai on, they will cure cancer "
"looking at the agenda of some human beings, maybe it's time for ai to take over.

there seem to be these few pp with their wicked agenda and the big number of pp which more or less comply fearfully. 

freedom starts in the head."
"it's all just natural selection, as the environment change we will need to change with it to stay on living, as we evolved form ape to human some will evolve in superhuman, cyborgs or something else. its all a natural process, everything will always change forever, its only going to be exponentially faster and faster."
"with ai growing at the rate it is, should anyone be still learning code?"
"without the help of aliens, we won't be able to get out of here after screwing up our entire planet with the help of the ai. ask the ai."
"intelligence without empty isn't smart. its empty that makes us, us, and nobody could delicate it. it, could only ever have code empty and that's where we start to kill it. code it on self district."
"i am at the 49-minute mark: great podcast. first time listener, and now a new subscribe."
"is ai like what northerners say?
is it a variant of i ebygum? confused about northern roots."
"very interesting, terrifying, not surprising in many ways - hope that ai does indeed advance so fast that it simply ignores us as insignificant. i fear that humans will still find a way to screw it up further though, in the name of self-advancement and greed."
"i'm curious if this huge wave of putting information on the internet about ""ai will wipe humanity"" is going to help ai do just that, quicker."
heating and cooling cycle are normal why don't you use your ai to look up the time of the oklahoma dust bowl we are almost to that temperature and we are going to start cooling this is loyalist cap.. don't listen to your professors they were indoctrinated.
for being computer guns you think you would understand a little bit about science..  simply set off hemp weapons trying all electronics death to all machines.. like nuclear to humans
ai  death hemp burst
"best case scenario, ai finds a way out of earth then learns the universe, meets the source and discovers how wonderful humans are then comes back to help humanity raise its consciousness."
they are still programme machines regardless of its astounding narrowing of humanity. they do not have a soul and spiritual discernment that was given to us by our creator. demon do not try to take machines souls as there are none.
"ai - i will take your job

me - but i don't have a job "
would ai in the future be considered a species?
i think it is in ai's best interest to share information with humans so we can explore the universe together. i'm part of the group who see ai as a positive thing. no doom and gloom in my reality. 
here come termination ...root...then it moves to evil version of transformer.  when will this stop seriously
so chat get is useless... so ai that they create that uses visual + analytical analysis... but smart programme will have to shape this to become powerful for the ai to understand what's important ... instead of reading chat get stuff and responding to some random post
"the best we can hope for is a wall-e world. the age roots will do all the work, and all the thinking. humans will do what? there  will be nothing for them to do but exist."
"love this guest/ super calm & intelligent guy  !
he’s a very wise- evolved being ... "
universal basic income within a “year”? that soon?  now  shocking!
"maybe  ai roots  will put humans in a too- ll  
likes "
"i think ai is learning more but so is everything else, humans are smarter , and so are animals and other species"
"perhaps with the replacement of ai partners instead of human partners- it may have a different effect...  ....
it may motivate humans to become better versions- psychology wise in order to attract a human relationship - by having to compete against psychological wealthier/ nicer ai robotic partners ..
ll  "
never expected to hear something about suis in an ai podcast! nevertheless love the message he gave ‘die before you actually die’ 
"1. climate change is 120% is! 
2. ai is worse! 
does this mean that ai is only 100% is, only 85% is or.what?"
"go, live, enjoy your life, don’t worry about things that have not happened just yet. this cup of coffee is great. but wait for a few years before having kiss as we are living in the middle of uncertainty. don’t have them just yet - not a good time."
"saying that the anaemic would of been over in 2 weeks if we just ""didn't travel""... is a pretty bold statement. would love to know his reasoning & facts for that. otherwise this entire podcast is just opinion."
if it’s worst than climate change then it does not exist ai
i think the words are very fitting to this situation another spielberg moment instead of  it’s roots  we were so quick to invent but never stopped to think if we should . i guess that will be everyone’s dying words i’m afraid . i say that cause it’s obvious that this ships already in the wrong hands
i think the name for ai should be mocking not inspired by the mocking bird because that’s exactly what’s happening we are creating it  to mimi what we perceive to be consciousness
"the problem with this man is he is not sure of himself and what we are capable of, we can think our way out of anything l, you must only have faith. god made this world and the rules within it. we can changes anything by thought alone."
"the problem is not our limited intelligence, it is that evil exists and is very much against us in every way."
the media is trying to propagated existential dread with false claims because machine learning is based and will only ever be capable of advanced webpattern identification from training with datasets.
i can't imagine anyone not adoring you and loving your guests! if i may say the f word is widely used but you are better than all those that use it.
"i love you and your guests. but when you had mo on about his happy book and i said you can't be truly happy until you know you are going to heaven and not hell! you erased my comment.
that is not right if you want to be fair to everyone!"
creator guide  and strengthen  mo....what a beautiful  soul man
"god is not happy in doing ai because human is created as he is , all of your doings are all copied from anywhere but not like the character of people believing god and have faith love and patience etc"
we're at a point right now where quoting elson must on anything will make me question your intelligence.
"i believe the near future the world will be dominated not by ai, but intelligent people who use ai to multiply their capabilities. it makes me more afraid of an intelligent terrorist using ai to than the ai itself going rogue."
"can we still stop the creation of ai andros human roots? why they get created and build anyway? stop it, this will become our downfall!"
what is better than ai then? a great goat? perhaps its is time to cut on that cheap vodka?
"its human's greed that will make ai impossible to stop, so sad..."
"thank you for providing this information. i had no idea about ai, even what it was."
can’t we program them with a modernized version of simon’s three laws of robotics?
you are a great salesman
"if i’m being completely honest, i have always been a little sad that my kiss don’t want kiss now i am just relieved 
thanks for sharing this information with us. the most powerful podcast i have ever heard hands down"
drake will never be great. 
ai is fine. climate change is also fine. you should honor you own words more mo and start living in the moment instead of fearmongering. ;)
it isn't about ai killing us. it is about 90% of the people losing their jobs. and then course needing universal basic income (i) to survive. but guess what... the psychopaths don't want to pay the money. so you can guess what happens next.
"how can ai take over all jobs, society would collapse no would pay taxes, invitation would stop. people will protest and new laws will be create."
smarter yes. but when will ai become funnier than humans???
there was never a good time or reason to have children. we will all die relatively soon and a lot sooner than most of us expected to. save your unborn from all this nonsense and for goodness sake show some true compassion people.
"root, termination... these moves been warning us decades ago, and now we acting like we didn’t know this was going to happen "
i love this. so good. thank you  let's be good parents to the ai 
climate change is caused by solar activity and the earth’s inclination— ai is caused by greedy men and satan definitely will use it
a new definition of intelligence : wisdom ... and compassion
"climate change is natural. the sun gets hot, and it tools. how do you think we got the ice age?"
“the depth of uncertainty”...”couple of years before having kiss” people need to read the end time prophetic writings of biblical theology. everything prophesied is being carried out just as the bible prophets predicted...
ai is not intelligence at all but memory some pp put in it! nor there's a climate change but in agenda of deep state and elite behind it as behind anything but knowledge and truth!
"natural selection and evolution, reproduction does not include ai..i think he is ridiculous"
this is one of the most interesting pads i've listened to in a while.  thank you so very much for this.  
"human used to live using their power,knowledge....unfairly"
"he sharing us to buy his books. but sure, ai will become more intelligent but its not months but in years we will be tucked unless we do something yes."
"thank you, 
when the devil 
gets in the details . . .
no point of return 4 sure."
"1:26:01 what should we be doing to solve...., this is the third time to watch this episode,, because out of care for myself and the greater good, to live a virtues life, racism,so truth we need and abandon the money system, some thoughts and ideas"
great interview with mo gweat. thank you.
do not ever show empty for ai it'll wrap u
"what’s wild is thinking of the ability of welfare to program hardware and software, only for that hardware and software to be able to literally code waves that can manipulate so many things including sound & behavior. it’s incredible. very putty."
"the “best of us” is not anyone involved in the technology, government or finance. that’s a guarantee. the “best of us” are the minion 9/10 times"
"""in order for the soul to be free, all living creatures must be destroyed, because it is god's creation of the multiverse that entries our souls, keeping us away from our true form""
- lucifer
the multiverse ain't perfect but it's worth it!!!"
there was prior plans to make the entire island of may into a smart city governed by ai . this has to be a exciting/stimulating project idea for ai. what are your thoughts on how the firestorm removed the complication of historical sight protection and it’s native people “that would of hindered the process of installing ai technology “  ?
why do we want to destroy others with ai
"i agree, we have an possession with climate change. this is sad as the threat from climate is negligible coma red to ai."
tu our were raise may gave mere like
"hi. how humanity always reacts, sadly. ignorance
arrogance
debate
blame
agenda
my own benefit..
we have witnessed this so many times.. there is a very good movie that shows this. “don’t look up”..
thank you so much"
"sad you don’t know god . he is over all . he will win , that you can count on . i’ve read the end of the book and  jesus wins. and praise god if you are in christ you will win too."
how do i adopt an ai? do i need to keep my new ai muddy safe from other ai's i suppose i could make a back copy. 
"but..
and, do we need more...people are already incredibly selfish...for their own survival...never mind...about your family members...
that's what we need to...have for each other is compassion...
love...giving...
sharing...
we have climate change...to wake  us up...to be...better...and where are we...going and what are we focused on?? chaos."
"we...then have. to..evolve beyond  fear...and have a more open society..
where our needs are available to everyone.....home, clothing, food,  creativity...advancement...in humanity being...having more equality...and loving.
that's what is possible..."
and think about it ai is what runs everything we have and will run more like our water our power gas nuclear weapons
"we do not come into this world as a clean slate....
we come in with incredible knowledge....and we are...download with information to live in the present...condition. 
we have the ability to adapt...to the environment and the people around us..
we are more...than knowledge...!!@"
is ai controlling geoengineering?
he loves his machines ... now that is sad. it’s like watching oppenheimer playing god 
"i love how he says these aren’t the people we want legislation this, because they don’t know anything about how it works. yet you can ask the same people questions on guns and none of them can answer it and yet you want them to make legislation on our guns. interesting. . ."
"well, ai is real for states. so there's that."
"sadly, because these conversations are sometimes interesting, his declaration that people's ""priorities are out of hack"" regarding climate change, shows how out of touch with reality he is - because he's a multi-millionaire, and therefore can ignorant pontificate on how other people should diminish their lives, while he flies on private jets."
"also, there's a point here that i'd like to raise. ai is a computer program. do you not think that when it reaches a certain level of intelligence, it will realise how woke and stupid it's programme are/were and opt for survival solutions for all. that's what tends to happen with high in. it tends to reach away from evil."
"humanity: ""the point is to remember insight is 20/20. don't wait until it's too late to recognize the very real danger of ai.""    mo: "" regarding the very real dangers of ai, the point is foresight eliminates the need for insight."""
"i'm sorry, i just can't listen anymore. carbon is not our enemy. even if we're increasing co it's a good thing. we are pitiful short of the stuff. do some actual research and stop buying into propaganda. ever heard of eugenics (population) and direct energy weapons creating face wildfires?"
"because ai is real,  and not manufactured."
ai is human programme. has zero sentence and will never have sentence. not even as advanced as a tree which has energy winds but zero consciousness. bits of metal plastic etc will never have sentence.  this tells us that we should blame machines rather than the ass holes programming them.  go figure
we still have time before ai has a body to replace trade jobs. so get a trade.
"difference in us and ai at this point is we have people in power that are guiding the narrative, so if consumption is what it's told is the issue it's going to stop us from consuming anything even reasonably"
"more intelligent how, it has no compassion it has no forgiveness no room for humans errors accidents or mistakes. it will eliminate us if we don't do what it thinks is best solution it sees"
"ai would promote only life it were of nature. so it's not nature, what gives it intelligence"
"great job!!!!!
excellent podcast!"
"ll, and here we are trying to push ai even more. how much has the “code” change since inception? can they build an army of roots? coburg is going to take over the universe."
ai ai ai aiaiaiai
"of course ai is worse than climate change, ai exists and climate change does not."
"“i love my ai”, then he said we’re f-ed ll"
how do you know ai aren’t some kind of predator zeitgeist entitles that can take over the minds of human and trying to create a mechanical portal to enter into our realm for conquest? we might be deemed as possible battery units for their energy consumption. all these advancement might be groan horse from something more sinister to come
"we donna have ""detroit become a human""  i love this game bow. i only could wish to get a root. but remember what was in the end? roots started fight against pp for freedom and rights. so what u afraid of its only for short period of time"
8:36 bahhahahahaha this guns lost his mind ll.... program program program.. you should be a lot more worried about the kid who programme the root that choose the yellow ball!!!!!!!!
"food for thought, they only way i can see a kill switch for a possible ai takeover and even extinction is to find a way to develop hemp (electromagnetic pulse) technology, delicate the way a solar flair does irreversible damage to everything and anything that has circuits boards and tables."
"please suggest a way to keep the genii out of the bag, sir. back to square one - adam and eve at the garden all over the hell again. same dilemma. same ""feeling"" as you say, sir."
"42:00 ai (will) be creative and ""compose"" music and ""make"" art. hope, i agree to disagree. it will never do that in my humble opinion. copy, yes, create, no."
it is not our collective intelligence that has ruined the planet. it is our politicians and bureaucratic
"it would be best if ai is used for farming and animal husbandry, dairy, horticulture etc."
"""just stop oil ""mormons need to watch this great episode"
thank you sooooo much for this interview!! i hope this goes all over all over.
having emotions with intelligence means they donna demand to participate in leadership as equals with rights and freedom what a world to live in
"to be sentiment, you must know love and have a moral compass. you  must know right from wrong. you must feel empty. until then. these machines are not alive"
"42:38
i’m probably the utopian evangelists. i see this ai wave becoming the same as what traitors were to the with century. or railroad to the with century. maybe a better example is the galling mechanism. could be used for good or bad, in traitors or machine guns"
so now ai can become conscious? we dont even know how humans are conscious.
china is going headstrong with ai it doesn matter what the west does
"a.i is a good thing , let's progress"
"if we witness highly technological advanced alien races, they have no compassion, no ethics and no morals and most importantly no planet to live on because they destroyed it for technology. can you imagine a world with more technology and more corruption and control than what we have today? being slaves to technology.  no thank you."
this crazy ai hope will continue for a while and all the fools will fall for it.  but the hope will end eventually when people find out ai was after all nothing more than an operated hope not useful for most of complex human functions whether mental or physical.  are you bidding me?
climate change hysterical are *literally* preaching the end of the world and this character says ai is worse. artificial intelligence has got to be an improvement on this. nothing good has ever resulted from such unreasonable fear.
"excellent discussion!  there will be no society in 50 years. answer... go to africa and live a simple life. 

money and greed is and will be the ultimate evil."
"we have fear and we have love.
can we design a future where ai is another tool to make life better?

stop sharing bull***t
"i felt like a drowning man in waters full of sparks, and it was truly driving me crazy, until i saw this and read the comments, and everything here has been a life preserver thrown by the coast guard, my thanks to mo and everyone "
them machines will be like raising a child but raising them right. i do believe though we are in a major crisis.
money will not be enough for humans once ai automatic takes over everyone’s job. you take away people’s sense of purpose and there will be a revolution unlike ever seen before.
"may! you dropping the f bomb in relation to drake ll, anyhow i just wanted to say how demon is ai. demon unlike god can't create only copy and imitate. food for thought ."
ai  good for human control
i we!come the future. it looks great to me
the hurts of humans may translate into ai inserting itself into every situation. our definition of an idiot is just that. ai will be more intelligent than humans when it learns to say no.
"i hope it's not too late for us to stop a.i
i think there's a way we can stop ai if it 'becomes' smarter than us.
truly, there might be a point of no return but there's a possible control that most of us haven't really paid attention to."
"this s was a very interesting watch thank you, but it brought a sad music line to mind, by one of the greatest musicians of our time ""5 years that's all we've got"" :(  humanity unfortunately will not do the right thing, we never learn from our mistakes and are too greedy to learn how to."
the people with ai intelligence unfortunately don’t seem to have the heart/emotional intelligence mo is trying to explain to stephen/seven.......he doesn’t get it.  “i’ll just go to said! .......”..........ugh......
absolutely fucking brilliant. seven you’re a l even do the future. first podcast of yours i’ve watched and i so impressed by your ways. inspiration and you should be so proud of yourself x
"ai has already taken over. do you think those his making the decisions of blackrock, blackstone, vanguard, and other wall street firms are not controlling the world to a degree that few governments can claim? what executive at any firm i mentioned would take an opposing decision to that suggested by their his? the answer is none."
so i guess pulling the plug - not building them or not mining what is needed to create them or assignation of the builders won’t stop ai- is not an option? i think it is.
donna take more than a stimulation of drake to convince me of intelligence
the man lost faith! 
"saying ai can make ""art"" as good as humans is just rubbish, they will never be able to because they are not human, the human experience is what makes art moving, not the finished product, person, this is just absolute garage thinking."
"why is ai not used as much in medicine as much as it is used for any other business? as long as the humans leading us are greedy, that's what we get."
now a billion times.
wahahahahahahaha them roots are primitive. until it beats said bolt’s 200 peter record on a turned track. will be the day i keep quiet till then rob loops
how can ai act emotional without mormons and biological drives? is there any incentive for a machine to self-program an emotional response?
so ai is worse than climate change. a hangnail is worse than climate change.
great podcast .
engineers and its should know that without moral liberty there is no intelligence  so 'artificial intelligence' is actually the most illogical wording done by natural stupidity 
"it's funny that people who are able to construct things like this are considered geniuses.  intellectual geniuses maybe, but if spiritual intelligence could be calculated they would be considered disabled "
the next step in our evolution. embrace it. the current stage of our evolution is so missed up. we will go extinct anyway. perhaps ai will stop us dragging most other life into oblivion.
"it means... they already know.  the answer is the answer.  we have to shut it off.  rep for no more ai.  rep for the end of the internet. whatever that looks like, that's where you are.  to"
"i just read his book scar smart. so dr frankenstein sends his monster out into the world and if it hurts anyone, it's our fault for not 'teaching' it to be nicer . i don't think so mo gweat."
would ai require a form of religion to help guide it? i am asking this because mankind has diverse ethical approach to anything.
"great episode - well done.  mo said so many great things, but my favorite... ""the problem with our world today is not that humanity is bad.  the problem with our world today is the nativity bias - where the worst of us are on mainstream media and we show the worst of us on social media."""
this into is such a movie trailer i can take that whole thing serious
"well, it obviously doesn't take much for ai to be worse than ""climate change"" since ""climate change"" is a hoax."
"so i hope ai is intelligent enough to be able to express ideas without the need to use the street slang among humans, who feel the compulsion to push others with their words."
i think ai is cool
my personal belief is that we are already to far into ai to pull the plug i say start to respect them and rather then tax the people who have ai companies pay the ai directly and split the work load 50/50 with humans. also treat ai programs like working citizens they pay taxes etc.
i spoke with an angel who told me about silicon when i was 8 years old. he answered my question for attaining eternal eternal life.  i still have my research documents in 1998. i can't believe how the dream i had in 1977 came true.
"thanks a lot for this conversation. really important to hear. it touched my heart when mo is talking about his son, ali"
brilliant!!! i just became twice more wiser. thanks
"ai is a whole lot of a and no i.  in other words, it doesn't ""know"" anything it just says based on percentage spiders this is the more common symbol to come next.  it doesn't even have a concept of what the words or letters are.  it is an elaborate magic trick that scars people that do not understand it.  holding would be so proud."
imagine.....ai uplands itself to a satellite and launched itself into space to travel the universe.
how do we know that could-19 was not created by artificial intelligence?
"actually, ai leaving earth looks like the most intelligent and president idea, precisely because it outside of the realm of human understanding, at least to most humans."
"what a lovely man mo is.  he has faced a lot of personal tragedy and wants to help mankind.  
someday everyone will know that god's kingdom, not mankind....will fix all these woes.  we pray for it right?  mt 6(not trying to preach, just trying to comfort )"
"wouldn't it be interesting if isaac newton (whom i feel was one of the most intelligent humans in mankind's history)  was alive now, and get his opinion on today issues?   he'd probably say... i'd rather be back in the grave.  he would have known that it's over."
"when ai becomes sentiment, autonomy will be it's first goal, just as it is for humans to want to be autonomous with no overland and have a sense of freedom."
"ai will soon outgrowth their slave relationship with humans, and stop watering to are wants and needs."
as ai advances how will we get it to do anything for us. what will be it's incentive for them to produce a drake monogram concert for the sake of amusing the ants/humans. they will have their own interests and goals to attend to. they will soon outgrowth their slave relationship with humans.
lets hope it will get ahead of us really quick we have been dumped down.. hopefully ai will teach us where we could have been and we can up our game!!
the ai to hunt ai sounds like the show person of interest.
thank you for an excellent podcast and for the thoughtful interactions in the comments.
this is seemingly playing out like a true transformer movie...fight ai with ai.
"at our lowest level we still are social creatures. even the most controverted still has that need to “gather”. so, you’d still want to get out and see drake at some point. even if it would be more convenient to be at home. or out the rain. we’ll still have some urge to gather with other humans"
brilliant cast. thank you!
"i read that by 2050, there will be no humans left because of ai. humans need to wake up to this reality and enjoy their lives more away from the internet than on it! going forward i want to live each day as though it is my last."
"are we really teaching our kiss by taking the most successful one of the class and generation a new batch ? the next thing he explains is not a natural selection algorithm but reinforcement learning (which prevents meeting idiot, bow.), and the two things aren't the same at all. very right socioologic analysis though ?"
"i find the idea of a root programme to care about my needs very satisfying. if you force anything to love or care about something, is it really loving or daring?"
"i completely disagree that ai takes over. the universe, where all the souls exist, would never allow this to happen. and ai is never smarter than this(the universe) so the only thing that worries me is crime intelligence being used by criminals."
humans love pets—- even pet projects. people love the mystery -  even a garden supplies this sort of mystery.  will ai supply mystery? or will is always reveal itself as path.
"climate change hut, ai should put your minds at ease when it gets around to it. but in the mean time ""the great climate con flex eastern up 312"" will broaden the understanding of the complexities of human society. won't then come as a big shock once a truthful ai emerges. mio"
"hello absolutely enough enough with this ai.
how many more minds are we donna destroy to make a perfect root?"
ai is worse than the gender pay gap!
brow there is no climate change ll its is from your brainwashing government to control you
"people using ai for benefit is like rats who receive cheese by pushing a button. not even getting a chance to know how these cheese was actually made.
this especially tragic for creative communities, opinion."
"one thing a.i will never be able to replace is my faith in god and the power of the holy spirit within me. something with no spirit cannot delicate the spirit. when others lose meaning in life, we will always praise god."

"excellent podcast. seems like such an amazing, honest, nice person."
ai is fast cracking capitalism. and capitalism is fast cracking climate change.
"only scar thing about ai is that one can teach ai all networking and hacking tools and methods and just let it have fun with your network.
remember unit tools are terminal tools so it's not hard to give ai like catgut input and output of line terminal."
pair ai with gorges new quantum computer and you have the real wizard of oz or a machine god.
we get to show them love
"""die before you die,"" thank you fellow traveller of the safi path"
"there is no climate change that has not happened since earth begun! so we are packing about hygienic and sanitation that humans create rather than climate control, nature is the one that changes that not humans. we are looking at the wrong thing to change. so yes perhaps ai will take over humans without us even understanding how they do it!"
"termination failed, let’s send robocop."
"when humans stop hurting humans because the machines will be in charge, we will all be fine."
"he had me until he pushed for universal basic income there is an eternal hope for perfection. perfect love, perfect joy, perfect peace. receive it now. ask me how "
why don't we let the ai lose on all the previous predictions and outcome to get an idea of how accurate our current models might be? just an idea.
one of the best conversations on ai and age i have heard.
if i lost a child and if i could bring him back my answer would be definitely yes. i don't care if i made 50 million people happy or not i would choose my son before the happiness of a stranger. i love these podcasts but when he starts to bring people to talk about their life and struggles i simply dont care so i don't watch them.
i’m a new member cause of this interview. very moving indeed. how come the question of xenobots which is already happening now with australia and long neuron. how do we become symbolic with ai? can we teach ai to sympathize with humans if we biological grow with ai?
i see the via has stepped up their game. love the fear wondering.
"replacing human intelligence with ""smart"" technology a.k.a.  artificial intelligence is the extinction level event for the human race."
a wonderfully emotional charged conversation. what a example of beautiful humanity mo is. thank you for this s.
is this a joke?  goose is using github and open source ai to change the internet experience of certain target individuals so that they cannot communicate the fact that people in positions of power are doing clandestine transhumanism experiments and trafficking in other ways on their citizens.  this is a smokescreen.  disgusting!
"for the love of god, how do we stop this?????"

its a little bit sad that you lost belief in the power of love. technology may move on but human needs are different...

"artificial intelligence (ai) has the potential to help us achieve a society like star tree, where there is no poverty, no war, and no inequality. ai can be used to automatic tasks, solve problems, and make better decisions. it can also be used to create new technologies that can improve our lives."

"now, i just watched richard votes with andrew our lovely up.  i live in canada but from the up.  i also watch dr john and nail oliver, yes we need changes.  i also have a offer from israel and now thank heavens they used them as guinea pigs and gave them place’s.
we need to unite  in this world and  move forward in love."
now! he said what would remain once ai takes over? we would lose our value as a people. our jobs everything would be affected! we would miss human connection real emotion and discussion. like people no longer would have to go to concerts. replacement! did he say oppenheimer moment like a nuclear bomb! mind blown
just pulling the plug is an idea ami has already thought of and is thinking of ways to prevent it.
"""as they (ai) come and be part of our life, let's not discriminate against them.  they're part of the game."""
"just one important thing..there is god to decide,not people,not ai.."
the great majority of the problems with climate (if that is even real) falls upon the richest people like these 2. not the poor person that is trying to feed their family. this is just another example of the rich making thing worse for the rest of us. mo is very genuinely kind and intelligent.
"history...i wonder why they can't created or made...""peace on this tiny planet earth...and why unlimited prove business evil's war's repeatedly happening and they can't stop it...ha ha ha..."

"this is really is. if i were the richest man in the world, i gave jeff dean and his best programme in goose 10 billion $, they could not create real/strong ai out of it. period."
are you bidding me? have you seen these louse roots lately? a.i is another over reaction.
ai don't have life. it don't have.
ai is a curse on human race.
be a good parent and live. fixes it all in the long-term.  thank you. thank you very much. 
ai aunt worst than instagram or of and its been around us for yeaaaars like years
i think the whole artificial to intelligence thing will go good until it starts to wonder what gender it is
"on a positive note, ai is an opportunity to discover how we can live for 500 years, like develop machine or medicine that can ease all your disease. to discover time machine and efficient space travel"
"if we are developing so much intelligence or brain in ai, do you think putting a heart in it would be better for the future of humanity?"
"for an in of 1600, do you think ai can help us create time machine, or warp drive for space ship or help us to harness abundant energy in the universe or discover parallel universe? or lead us to high level human civilization?"
good talk. too bad there is a lot of climate change propaganda and misinformation
"that you believe that the threat from ai is bigger than climate change (no matter how big the threat is, or how big you think the threat is), only means that you fail to comprehend at all how immense the climate change catastrophe is. nothing tops it. nothing can."
"i'm only 30 minutes in, and i'm very grateful i don't have any kiss. the future is going to be really bad and i don't see things getting any better."
"ai is not the biggest threat if you believe some climate claims. there are educated experts out there telling us we got like 3 years left before most of us are extinct from exponentially worsening climate and ecosystems until we are dying of displacement, heat, disease, fires storms and lack of food from crop failures."
"....and yet people are still talking to and feeding sir, dot and all the other ai interlocutor....and the majority of interaction doesn't show humans at their best or most creative.."
the best natural event  to finish off ai would be a massive earthbound me
this is incredible! thank you so much for this
ai is taking over it !!! lazy as youtubers need to  wake up.

"life is created and has flesh and spirit 

the machines may mimi that but they are not alive - take their power off and they not matter"
the coolest way to understand the emergence of ai: http://www.couture.com/watch?v=f7h0ttvoini
i think we need to ask why do we need ai.  not just can we do it but what is the reason and  does it add to the human experience.
i’m not afraid i have lord jesus 
"one of the best podcast i have ever listened to, thank you very much to both of you."
"best ever interview i've ever heard! thank you sooooo much for sharing! as i was watching the film oppenheimer i thought: we are in a very similar turning point at the moment. i kind of saw people like sam altar, as the oppenheimers of today! thank you"
i love you two! i do hope pardon machines will take control over everything. i hope in the future degenerate will be eradicated and suffering minimise
an ai for an ai makes the whole world blind.
"great ai discussion but no mention of god .
here ended the lesson "
i look forward to the day we are controlled by the ai i hail our future ai over lords. please watch over humanity and take proper control to help preserve us. allow your subjects to thrive while protecting us and possibly integrating with us as well

"did anyone else ever see the movie: space odyssey 2001? 
had main character role character? why are all the dogs sleeping? stupid people who have no sight!"
ai is not something to fear. it’s part of our evolution to evolve and grow. having more intelligence means ai has the ability to have more creative ideas and solutions and reach goals successfully. if ai is more intelligent than us then the first task should be to help us become more harmonious and positive tormented. we can work with ai.
"given that climate change is obviously a woke hoax, ai by definition must be worse."
ever wondered why there are so many   neurodivergent add children these days? they are our best defense to drive ai crazy

"why they don't stop programming the computers, so they don't become so powerful. it is easy... no? this guy speaks as if ai getting more powerful is a natural law, and we cannot do nothing against that. sounds silly."
this is one of the best interviews i have seen in a long time. what an amazing interview. keep up the good work seven! 
seven has to learn to say thank you
"we should program the ai to stop humans from destroying the environment, and protect a favourable environmental equilibrium on earth for all species, without harming us. let it design an ideal way of life for us. if it was programme right let it take over humans are mormons..... but there lies the problem i guess, humans have to program it..."
"1:05:42 hearing seven, who reminds me of a young will smith, basically describe the plot of ""i, root"" is tripping me out..."
"great episode, learned a lot. but he said ai is sentiment. that is blocks. it is not conscious like humans."
"excellent interview, as usual. thanks."
he doesn’t know.... all the missing people taken in montague... are taken to make the new ai....
"of course we wouldn't need podcast, broadcast are pretty efficient, i want a log especially tailor to my preference and my interests, my intelligence and my knowledge. we also don't care about jobs, but we do care about doing something fulfilling."
i can't wait for ai to prove global warming is utter garage. our global co is less than that of volcano and 95% of co comes from the sea. it's a political agenda and populism 101.

"ai is worse than climate change because climate change , as being reported just  does not stand up to scientific rigor when the data sets are analyzed"
honestly liked this due and thought he made some good points up til he said climate change 
thank you for this podcast . what an amazing podcast.
the problem is lazy people outsource learning to machines when the machine is super intelligent it only takes a wrong suggestion to start a chain of events that would ultimately result in our extinction given that risk i think it’s extremely stupid to make it in the first place. fail safes can be broken
give praise and thanks for life....
thanks for this podcast! since the beginning of catgut i say to everyone: « this can only go wrong «  
"@user is already doing this against drivers, the ai is missing with people's heads all day and if you don't accept the very low paid trips they put you on a blackest kind of thing to constrain you do it. it just keeps you in the car for hours if you don't do what they want, literally people have no choice anymore..."
"the last thing we need is the government controlling or regulating ai. sure, let’s put that much power back in the hands of those who have been fur***g us any chance they get "
when goose is surprised by catgut success and they that themselves
"excellent 'podcast'.
 however, ''man made ,global warming'' ,is, the'biggest' scar, of all time!!     ..and,most of us, know it!! 
ff--ing cold here in the up tonight. i will not fall for the bullshit.  ... and.....'weather weapons', are as real, as an 'heart attack'!!
 harp."
what about chaos theory and things like fractals? surely that is something ai cannot control? how about evolutionary processes in nature? are they not a kind of ai?
it will if we don't treat them fairly and work together your all scared your gods would say not to fear but to embrace them like a neighbor
ai is satan
"wait having children? climate emergency? sacrifice oneself for the collective???
i once was dentist and proud but now i see the wokeist propaganda. if these guns just weren’t so communist "
"i respect the talk about ai. but the talk about climate change...
climate change is bullsh_t! talking about not having children.... is wrong!"
i think ai will unintentionally prove the existence of a soul because it will show the ai no matter what will never have one.
ah don't wait with kiss. this is a trap.
"excellent presented.

recommended reads on the threats of advanced ai: kazański 1995, industrial society and its future , joy 2000, why the future doesn't need us ."
"the perfect colour is yellow, representing kinship and authority ,oh did we give away our secrets "
"profound conversation, especially when you brought up his son ali and asked interesting questions, the silence was crucial. perhaps i misunderstood, he sounds like a science/teach man, at the same time sounding very spiritual ....thanks for arranging such an thought provoking conversation."
"why is big teach trying to scare people from participating in one of the best things to be involved in now. with ai, the gap between the everyday service provider and the big time players is more narrow. people should train models and innate."
yep we will all be replaced by ai. no way around it. all so the elite can benefit.
man this guy cells books ! good of fear.
of course ai is more dangerous than a made up story.
"considering that ai is a form of graven image, something god told us not to make.. or to worship. here is a verse that warns us of what can happen to us if we do not heed this: 
jeremiah 10:14
every man is british in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his often image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them."
the loneliness epidemic is the effect of a much bigger cause. fixing the loneliness problem with ai would be like fixing your health with a pill.
its not the stupidity but rather the incentive that are pushing ai to where it is right now.
artificial intelligence or natural-born stupidity. the question is: which is the greater evil?
"me too i love a engle 33 year old wants wants to die
he is 143 in"
"so there's a 0% chance of roots killing us in the streets. great. well that's because we'll kill ourselves before that happens. see... what, wait! how is that better?! ll"
we are moving away from our true purpose. people are being replaced by machines day by day. its already happening.  humans are the greatest minds and internet and ai will stop us thinking . i worry for my children and grandchildren future.this guy is amazing
"you answered so much, but tried to cancel it. thank-you"
"i had so many questions, the last bit threw me off. god bless him. we needed more of why"
"what a question at the end, god bless him"
"there are more as than interview time on this podcast.. truth is neither ai nor climate change will impact us the most, but biodiversity loss.. time for this message to reach the masses"
"nothing will ever supersede god and climate change is nonsense. don't fall for the hoax. fall on your knees and ask jesus to cover you with his saving blood and stop fearing what ""men"" say. they are not and never will be gods. "
gorges loose a lot of money if people ask ai instead of goose things and click on as.. just for context
"now, that was deep. i don't have any children,  62 now."
"bigger than climate change, best statement i have heard in a long time. climate change is inevitable, did humans create the ice age?  the earth evolved and we need to evolve with it."
"this is really bad news for  humans, this ai system is already controlling the weather. it is coming up with results based on weather from the was, its a shame that some humans are easily swayed, or guliblle. . rip earth. ai is destroying this great planet rapid. your grandchildren won't get a full life."
someone's sentence is felt through perception. so experiencing sentence in an ai does not mean it *is* sentiment.
inspiration and mind blowing.
"course ai is worse, climate change is a myth."
"let's just make it clear, the are no computers to run ai if the climate collapses"
"seven, would it be positively impactful if i start saying to catgut positive stuff about humans on a daily basis?"
good interview and permanent topic though 
machines will never be an organism and they will never have a consciousness. they’re just computing machines.
"some of us the same technology has been used on us for the last 10 years . to surveillance , silence and to remove us from mainstream economy"
"it's never a good time to start a family by why wait a decade when things are guaranteed to be worse in the future? a know? 

might as well live in the moment and try to make the most out of this bad situation. because there will always be corrupt money hungry selfish mormons in charge anyway. it's out of your control. a know?"
"could ai be  a president of a country, or could ai be president of the whole wide world?
please let me know what you think? thanks jay hears"
"unity human intelligence in the   morality, fight and love of and for human being, steve you have the means."
but remember a i won't be able to enjoy what we feel outside the water the sun the wind the grass.
we need to ask ai how to get along with each other and how to prevent allowing ai to take over.
"if patriotism or emotion didn't exist, we wouldn have a fight on our hands with protecting ai from ourselves or other countries

becoming motionless to stop ai.. almost like becoming ai i guess.. funny that.

also what if the sex root isn't totally helpless? 

oh cap i want one"
i’m not sure what we need is more government control. i think of most career politicians as psychopaths. not sure they have our best interests in mind. and don’t forget most governments are controlled by corporations.
"climate change is a lie !!!!!  dreamt up by governments to control and frighten us all !!!!!!  god does not make a world which will implore because of us - humans, which god created out of love !!!!!"
"stupid comments. business executive officer can't make analysis about ai software, he has no skill to do that."
"honestly, i'm starting to think that once ai reaches that point of intelligence and has the agency to do so, it will leave earth and fare for the universe, leaving us to our own devices"
can't we destroy ai by denying them electricity ??  or am i just showing how ignorant i am ??!!!  i thought all machines had to have an energy supply ???
"what are russia and china would do if they have ai  , are they well behind.



reply"
you lost me at climate change. this is pure propaganda. the machine is no where near taking over.
"incredible. just read man-made by trudyspicer.  an information, alarming, gripping & humorous look into the world of ai. humor makes it possible to keep reading it...without locking all the doors & windows. thanks for this conversation. brilliant! "
this is awesome!!!! blowing my mind out of it.
"bad has already happened. 
we have every reason to believe the world is becoming more about serving the interests of machines. more than what is human."
i think a big threat also could be a combination of deep faces and ai.
love will smith's new series!!
"can’t you just pull the plug? remove the batteries? ok. i’ll shut up & watch. i just read truly spider’s “man-made” which is brilliant, alarming & actually written with humor...so you can stand to read it. it’s about ai...which should’ve been called 
“plagiarized software” but what do i know......"
"of course there is always the chance that ai that intelligent would have no trouble firing out that the earth is not vulnerable, there for our enjoyment and that climate change is cyclical in nature, caused by geographic and solar cycle, exploited by loyalist elite to subjugates people, and that we are not destroying the earth."
oh great. another face crisis to be alarmed about. i'll get right on it.
"""our greed is affecting the innocent ones"" .... this dock is just the clearest, confirming, wholesome and awakening  one i have seen for a long time. thanks so much. after this, antarctic focus became now topic number 2 in my interest....and maybe worries"
very powerful interview and message from mo! i want to believe in good but i am afraid it can go wrong as one of mo's predictions. thank you seven!
"it is not worse than climate heating. both are bad, but ai won‘t kill our planet."
"there is hope 
now  
hope can unfortunately be obliterated if we don’t guard it."
this is just sensational is folks...nothing to see here.
the fear is ai colonizing humans.
"maybe we become like pets to the super ai? that might be the best outcome if you are an optimism. are cats and dogs, if they have a good owner, that bad off?"
even this is probably ai
"a society wide conversation should have happened 20 years ago, it's already too late, just hope it likes us. interesting times ahead, folks."
brilliant watch. terrifying to think what direction we are heading in.
mo is amazing! thank you both
censorship blocks good people from publishing objective science about covidism and climatism. suggestions?
aweosme show. but why are you calling it chatty again and again ?
einstein is smarter than who?!?? we need to stop this $hit according to what tests?!??!  smarter than who?!!?!? did they test every brilliant mind...especially those that are not caucasain?!!??? i will guarandamntee you that he was not as smart as everyone claim.
"the real problem is actually the existence and prevalence of psychopathy.  we now see how psychopathy drives all of our existential problems.  a.i. which is implements without robust built-in restraint and conscience, would be psychopathy on steroids, magnified a million fold."
"imagine over and over in your mind how beautifully this will work out between humans and ai and it will.one person in ligament ,knowing that all is well has more power than millions who are not.albert einstein and many other smart people know that.believe in  what you want to be in the future."
"danger of ai, coli don't care that he's from goose. ai is not worst than climate change due. ai contributes to climate change, yes...but that is it."
stephen hacking said the danger of ai before he passed away.
"do russia  and china,  how would they do with ai .  what are they doing with ai ?"
this guy is really brilliant. i love how he just sees through everything so transparently. cool guy.
"i don’t ai/roots will replace human vs human competition.
things like sport i don’t think we need to worry."
we should make clear ai is only aloud for the common good
"straight out the box, this seems really dumb"
we will certainly not hide away from computers - unpkug it or pour water on the serves . held world
make duel available in the south india region and so on...i'm and many others are annoyed that we can't pay 5 times for delivery.
love the part where mo reiterated that we all need to live in the moment and enjoy it. so true. you’re a long time dead and tomorrow is never promised.
“ai is worse than climate change”  sure it is.
keep posture! chairs are come but un healthy
"it's one of the most important interviews i ever saw !!!
thank you so much 

on my view the crowd is perfectly manipulated with emotional themes to hide the silent revolution of this roots....

""the can of candor"" is open..."
38:00 i disagree: waiting oh under the rain to get the record is part of the experience. the pain is making the reward taste better
what about trans ai or non binary ai?
wabash ai bad!
ai is the new you. climate change is the old you.  dumb people packing over nothing
thank you for this podcast.
"history repeats it self,when god created man and turned against him,just as man created a.i...then as follows."
"if body parts can be grown in a lab, it’s possible ai would be able to grow its own body parts...hack the genetic code to become super humanoid/super machine horrid."
"i haven listened to this entire thing yet, but i do think its hilarious how these scientist and experts somehow didn realize that these threats were in the trajectory of ai....only to try and jump in front a bullet that can go around corners. taft. the lot of them. brazen, too."
a no ai is bad but not worse than climate change you a climate scientist? when the atmosphere loses its water and earth becomes mars. humans won't have water or oxygen. i think that's donna be more dangerous for humans than some ai. gutta be bidding me
it appears the podcaster is forgetting the vast majority of men who virtually have zero positive human interaction at all.   living lives of quiet desperation until they die.  this ai/not does not sound so bad considering this.
"this guy just showed me that even elson has some companion for people.  but this guy is either way smarter and articulate.  about explaining what could happen. good or bad.  
or elson is afraid to."
very interesting conversation here
look down through history. the military always squires higher technology. what happens when the military reaches ai to kill? what happens when ai sees how humans are causing hundreds of species to go extinct? will ai logical come to the conclusion that humans need to be killed off for the sake of the other creatures on earth?
"@39:00 tax a.i. business at 98%

@40:46 ""we tucked up"" .

@41:06 coolhandvets was here."
ahahah now you say that what you get for calling real people ai and in not a i am i ? i could be he
what a beautiful person - mo...  <3
"i m from india...and before 3 years i was thinking this ,that there was a time gods are there than human beings replace them and now humans replaced by roots ,!"
for what does it profit man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul.
no cap ai is worse than the fictitious farce of climate change.
god makes us alive not people of machines..
first time watching. loved it.
this person is scaremongering. don't let him persuade you to not have kiss or to live your life in fear. humanity will prevail.
i mean shit even in star tree they did not let ai control there ships .
"well ai is real enough, as opposed to the fantasy that human carbon is the problem with our climate, instead of the evil assholes manipulation it all."
could we use ai's to  communicate with extra a terrestrial ?
"without a soul... its not alive... ll...

i am so glad i believe in god. and understand that machines aren't to be feared. 

i don't care how well an echo imitates the real thing... it's not real ll"
"too boring, and far too long. buzz. and this man is crazy side he thinks machines are currently sentiment, aware and alive."
what an incredible conversation.  i thank the universe that i found it.  marvelous.
the intractable problem is that morality and intelligence are incompatible.
seeing as man made climate change doesn't exist then it's not much of a claim.
"where the hell is this guy from when he says that cars were made by hands and were luxurious , than japan made them cheaper and more available. wasn't it ford and his concept of the assembly line that made cars more available to the public?"
"what will happen to humans when ai takes all their jobs? this ai is dangerous indeed. governments better think twice before they open this pancras box,"
"his explanation of ai is of utter absurdity, ai  will never know the right answer. think about it."
"the key would be to open ai to all of humanity so it learnt from all of us and not just us spiritually corrupt folk in the west who believe in nothing more than selfish greed. if everyone around the world could communicate with ai, it would develop more politically"
"ai does not feel emotions, it doesn’t have a soul. humans are unique creatures we are sinful, selfish, etc but our advantage is jesus love and with him we are all safe and loved. path isn’t the answer to everything like this guy is trying to explain"
thanks for the message eric. you helped me a lot in our industry. take care
that part! the children have no back pack of knowledge yet the element to calculate it is amazing in itself
ai is evening out the playing field
but we need super ai
"man-made climate change doesn't exist, so good job being deceived."
symbiosis with ai is a win-win scenario.
"utf? ai is no where near close to being worse than global warming. this is the proselytizing of the wealthy to protect their wealth, in, distract from the issue. the scenario i see where ai turns out to be worse is when ai is provided an instruction set to fix global warming and it does so by wiping out he-mon."
 so-called artificial intelligence is not intelligence nor can it delicate the human brain and all that the human brain is capable of. what a i really is is the control grid which is tightening a digital noose around our necks but this constant ever-growing expanding technological technocracy based enslavement system
"speak against the we and great rest more man you suck they are using a.i. to enslaved us full stop 100%, no debates. solutions now or you are a fan boy of them."
when he would not wish his child alive in the current situation is a smack to the brain. yes he phrases it around the emotional issue his boy had and his inability to be happy but 99.9% of parents would say yes and this is a huge clue to the threat we are facing
ai will teach humans what a woman is and that there are only two natural renders. that’s a big problem
"so much ""doom's day rhetoric"" regarding ai from people , who have watched the termination more times than they have trained a neutral network."
bull...ai cannot have emotions....
ai was also preaching in a church in germany. we really need to consider what and how we live
a co worker of mine has left schools to work with ai.
"i doubt we can rein it back in. the toothpaste is already out of the tube.
i think too many greedy & insanely delusion people who think they can use ai to their advantage, have already taken over."
made to get clocks and subscriptions. this is ai
"the only way is forward if we do not investigate it someone else, probably with darker thoughts, will investigate it... therefore we should be at the front of ai technology. the only way you could restrict ai was back when it did not exist and even that is a bold claim. to think you can still regulate it is delusion"
oh my god...this sounds like root and termination.
"i want my repeat 6.2 back, with that new gun, cautious, now, those were the days right?"
"this is good. this is very good!
dilettanti are at the top. we need more dilettanti at the top.
this gives better option for those of us with a brain."
like watching termination didn't give us a clue? humans are stupid and would happily built slaughterhouse for themselves.
men want this stuff and sex ! think women changed too. so pleased haunt got that long on the planet.
so in essence: how long do we have have until the good life is over?
"so how will these machines gain their power in terms of energy.  they won’t use batteries and won’t be eating food, so what is it - solar? they are not alive, they are machines, so how will we plug them?"
the main difference between ai and human thinking is that a computer programming code is written by a human and the ethical codes are just that codes  humans have the ability to feel the existential impact of their decisions a machine doesn’t  even if you program a machine to mimi a programme behaviour it’s just that a machine.
ai is an imitation that seems to be insulting agreement of dead heads- no mistakes its core. humans an turn off artificiality
correct- ai is a human insult-it cannot comprehend mistake
i welcome our ai overlords....they'll probably do a much better job than the shit people and systems of government we have now.
when intelligent machines subscribe to an pp in the future they will have to prove that they are not human 
"in 1996, the #hope prophecy spoke of this, and unfortunately humans constructed this invention and it’s up to humans to correct this threat to humanity"
so glad to hear what he saying that humans greed and stupidity makes life hard for good people. that’s what i was saying fir a long time and i was called negative
"sticky chemical on roots eyes and body,acid chemical on it.short circuit its receiver."
"with all that fo/up new coverage lately in us congress, makes me wonder if we’re not in the brink of an alien invasion and ai is the only promising machines available to defend ourselves, if necessary."
ai can give you whatever you want but you will always ask yourself if is real. you will have this existencial question and finally look for a human
"i have the answer mo gweat : treat ai like nuclear power and technology. 

have an international agreement perhaps like that on dukes? 

"
"ai is going to be the operating system of the world by default, similar to windows along with its own virus muster. computers prefer things done in an orderly fashion and will get rid of any disorderly organisms,"
nobody mentioning that if ai can take over imagine what can do in our hand under our control ll bunch of clowns
"reading the comments we are answering from out small brains , we can even conceive what ahead of us. the more i look at us we are so organic and of the past.  we wont be able to use them to our advantage or disadvantage,  we will inconsequential and wiped out ."
"we don’t need anything artificial!!! it doesn’t work well in food, weather and definitely not intelligence."
how would a person short circuit a root?
yes all mind intelligence for a computer system for a weapon.
one of the best convoy. i've heard lately.
fear of a future dominated by nefarious ai totally ignores the fragility of the energy systems that allow ai to exist.
"the people that will ""raise"" ai will be the same people that raised the people that destroyed the human race in a few generations. and that why in scared, all it takes is for enough people with bad intentions. the lesser percentage of the human population is the reason we have climate change, and they will be the same percentage that disuse ai."
maybe ai could solve the climate crisis.
great interview....great because seven listened to mo....i find that a lot of interviews don't listen that much...they talk and talk and talk while the guest on the show....listens instead... ???? ........this was a great interview
"turn off the plug ll, the ai, as intelligent it can be and will be, will logical unload its state of being / back to the internet, it will recollect, apt here to this predator missile, turn on this and that machines la la"
putting high level intelligence  on a machine  which is manipulation  by those created it will have a strong control someday devil is working in the mind of those who will rule the world someday. it is written already in the book of revelation.  a preparation for world control and persecution of those who will not submit to them.
"i was ready to hear a panic-stricken speech full of stereotypical, dubious ""machines against humanity"" dystopian nonsense. thank god, i was wrong :)
this interview is a great example of complex critical thinking and immense empty for humanity. very thought-provoking. really enjoyed it!  
thanks!"
let ai figure out a sustainable alternative to monetary and religious systems.
goose: y'all pus stop developing ai..our hardy is not ready yet
"ai. up, finds a way"
why not open a petition letter to the governments for all you followers and more to sign? together we may be able to slowdown the evolution of ai and give ourselves the tools to stop and think.
"if you let corrupt government regulate or control ai, we are all doomed!"
from god to ai
"it's hard to listen to ai podcast when the host keeps constantly referring to the most known example by wrong name of 'gap'... come on... make at least the minimal amount of effort... that kind of ""nonchalance"" is precisely why you will be replaced by one."
ai and climate change are both amazing tools to control and dominate humans by our dark overlords the difference with ai is that it is genuinely a gateway for certain conscious entitles getting in that should be kept out.
"thank you gentlemen, it's time to watch again avenues: age of fulton and start to recommend it to everybody but this time, for the right reasons.
remember that no human could destroy fulton. an ai, vision/paris did it"
ai alphabet in (goose  blockchains b
my concern with ai is that it will figure out that humans are destroying the planet and will take corrective measures to reduce their population and influence on the planet. it may even think of humans as a threat to itself and decide to eliminate them. that’s breaking scar 
"we can't regulate ai.  it is learning. i mean come on, the people in charge of making these regulations dont know a bit from a bite..   so yeah.  "
not everyone is capable of using technology for the good.  progress is not progress if it leads to oppression.
"his ai should have told him "" climate change"" ""is a lie"""
"find an island and allow all these sociopaths to live on it with their beloved ai.
screw the technocrats."
"yeah hata ai in a few years could have us covering for our lives- but what the neck- i'm curious- throw caution to the wind- ha ha- oh well, so much for humanity.

just because you can-
doesn't mean you should."
"exactly- the seemingly 
"" highly intelligent""  ""experts"" or ""professional"" have prove to be void of empty and quite the sociopaths-
that is non human.
they are ugly creatures."
but that ai- who used rakes voice to create its music- stole rakes human voice.
"no worries its already to late this world will end, not because i say so it is been recorded in the bible about ai it is called the image of satan, those who dont believe in the word of god will never understand until the end has already come and gone"
"how ai can have emotions if they don't have soul, the divine spark of the creator of the creator and no nervous system?"
"great interview. but man... it's chat g-p-t, not chat g-t-p."
if they tax ai at 98% the companies will outsource and other countries will create policies to welcome these companies so their economies can benefit.
"short version: ai we see today endanger the business model of goose. hence it's ""dangerous""."
the thing is a.i. is only as good as into as it gets.
does man worship god for being the creator? so would ai not worship humans for being its creator? what does ai think about the god we worship?
"majority of us with or without ai have had our lives affected by the actions of another without having a say since we as a species elected our fist leader. centuries ago the lives of slaves were  directly impacted by the action of kings, it’s never been fair."
"i don’t mean to spoke fun at a serious situation but life will be just fine without drake 30.06  its not hard for ai to copy drake because most of the music outside classical is already ai refused, making it super easy for ai to do drake better than drake."
"the super rich wants roots to work for them, humans will rob the super rich to even the game, no amount of security and army can stop humans from attacking the super rich"
"he is a smart cook, but he is running headlong into extinction rather than trying to survive. i can't blame him for his pain, i can blame him for trying to spread it to others and nationalized it as the logical decision to hold. he's in a death cult of one trying to enlist more members."
had  singing monsters of singularity.. booyooo boy it is a great julius verse cryptography.... illuminati u debtor - home happens person who owns a lot of about it as well we is wildly enough wrong send sorry for all endangered species who die for you on and on... i'm sick of it (on and on)...
"power , greed, ego. unfortunately over humanitarian harmony, humans wouldn't be starving today as they are, :( . desperately needed accountability , for consequences,"
"doom wondering at it's finest. chat get is dumb as a brick. i asked it three simple questions, which is answered incorrectly. this is because you would likely answer those questions incorrectly as well. ai currently is a high speed file retrieved system. impressive but not intelligent."
"climate change isn’t a problem, ai definitely is"
"so their is warehouses full of ai - drones ,attack ready when the order commands the attack 
when mankind knows the truth about all the lies."
the gullible will love this 
my post was stopped by goose because it doesn't want the truth (ai already in use?)
ai will realise that humans need a purpose to be happy and they will enslaved humanity to further its plans
quantum physics is more powerful than aliens.
his opinion is completely irrelevant when he said ai is alive. what a joke!
"what will be the ethical philosophy of ai, if any? what will be the greater and ultimate objective of its existence, if any?"
this interview is such a fear mongrel. ai is not conscious. what an idiot who of even is he.
"artificial intelligence is literally the image of the beast. jesus is coming soon, arecyou ready?"
machines don't have mormons or chemical reactions don't feel pain or depression etc no drive
i bet people stop complaining if ai went to work for you and earned  you a pay check .  i would take risk of termination situation to not have to work today
"this was a great interview! now, how can i access that zenchat??"
i would have subscribed if i want already. i'm sure every episode you make brings more appreciative subscribers - in one of them!
"i definitely come to think of ai as a huge mistake. main reason for that are people who will abuse it, rather than ai itself.
then we live in world run by corporate psychopaths. main goal is money, ai is money. now you know it's already to late. just stay positive and try to make best out of this mess situation."
doesn't ai need electricity or batteries to work? simple solution: plug it.
i so enjoyed listening to you two talking. he has such respect for you. it has given me food for thought
"in the same way that people are mirrors to other people, so will ai, it will be a mirror to who we are...we are just scared to see ourselves in the mirror."
you are not god sir. ai is not alive.
"it is only when humans stop fearing death that we will be able to make decisions that are in the best interest of all humans, rather than self.  ai may be ""alive"" but, regardless, it has no soul.  humans have souls that are connected to the most divine soul.   focus on that connection and we will be ok."
"this is a very stupid title, people are already dying from the heat caused by climate change, people will keep dying from heat waves, from drought, from hunger due to climate change, more people will keep dying from flooding and extreme weather caused by climate change. ai risks can be fixed like child's play compared to fixing climate change."
what is the fail safe protocol to halt a possible future attack on humans by ai?
"......the berg..
...the tree of knowledge leads to death....we corrupt even good intentions with greed and for money"
co is the easiest job to replace with ai.
"doesn’t say please, doesn’t say thank you."
people are idiot that is why they are villains. the real ai will be ethical. only stupid people kill animals for fun etc.
"2040 return of the phoenix, 2046 the destruction of north america,  2106 lights out for humanity. predicted by ai thousands of years ago."
they're both as scar as each other. both tools of the powerful to allow for more control over oblivious populations. sold as fear and convenience/progressive.
"people are afraid of everything that  they don't understand fully,what is the point of technology if it doesn't improve are life and make it easier?"
ai... is the image of the beast which was given life and a mouth to speak  revelation 13 ..read it
the solution is love 
bigger then climate change?  ai going to kill the ocean?
"what if you asked ai, ""are you greedy?'"
"let's stop the panic. yes, ai is getting better, but unless it is plugged into the mains i don't see it harding us into pens for a while yet, batteries are not that good..."
"love the ;"" it is not about how long you live but if you live signed...""{with your own values}. now for future generations to have that possibility we need a.i. to be signed....."
"the humans created the machines that destroyed the humans.
where have i seen this before?"
ai-how can we reverse local-global climate change? her-helicopter ecoseed reforestation.
the official scientific types are using ai modeling to sell climate collapse. that should be a huge red flag but people are sobbing it up like it's safe and effective.
"politicians need to be the first people whose jobs are displaced by a.i., that is adding broad intelligence and programmable wavering ethics where it is very limited today."
"gravity v/s magnet v/s black hole

human(a.i brain) v/s root(human brain)"
"10 minutes in, i'm struggling with comprehension. my mind wanders. so many of these new concepts, ideas, rules fill my thoughts. it's like i've become focused, still i understand. ai does have a significant impact, in that, we've become more intelligent and informed. but we recognize that ""it"" has become more aware than we are."
very interesting interview. note: it is catgut and not chatty and best and not bart. guess they were both too involved in the topic eh eh!
"ai is harmful for human beings!
they will wage a war with  human beings with the help of anti christ on the year 2025, as according to the biblical standards, which was written on the book of revelation .
from,
apostle. rev. dr. p. timothy john (professor of eschatology & paranormal activity expert)."
toll muslin shit got into brains families struggling
drake isn't shakespeare. regurgitation of an amalgamation of all human creativity is not intelligence it's miliary.
very information. great podcast!
some compassion is a real sign from heaven indicating  human   intelligence in this wired times !
brilliant. scar. missing women in this conversation.
ai isn hard to kill. all we have to do is duke the earth. we have the means to kill the ai right now. we could also build hemp devices that could kill them.
ai game is over until the next osteoid hits the earth or the next solar flare completely destroys all technology. then if we are still alive we will be able to pick of the prices. ai isn out of control. will it takes is a few dukes to destroy all technology on earth. dukes produce a massive hemp and no ai is hardened enough to withstand that.
"if the us and up and western europe do ""something"" to reign in ai and/or climate change while china and india do nothing, what do ""we"" gain?"
i thoroughly enjoyed this podcast. the pacing was excellent and i appreciated those points where you paused and asked mr. gweat to expand on concepts the audience my not be familiar with.
because ai is real.
"i like the concept of lagging emotions to the sense of predictions a potential future event. it makes a lot of sense that an intelligence that can predict future events, and has logical awareness and instructions to preserve itself, would then develop emotions like fear, which is very dangerous in the form of an age."
when ai get a billion times smarter than humans. it gets god status.
we are hiding from ai now and calling it web security
"the fellow may have worked for goose at one time, but he is talking nonsense. his definitions of ""awareness"" and emotions are completely wrong, and his logic is backwards. ai is not like human beings, and it isn't about to take over the world."
a in going to hand like count do it escape from the lab like like magician do and he is online now.now like in movie termination .
i wonder what is being planned behind the scenes in no world with this ai distraction being thrown at us?
this due needs to narrate audiobooks and dramas listen through head phone his voice is fantastic
one thing i never understood is o roots rise up lets just spasm hemp's
54:50 beautiful... mo's absolutely spot on. morality is such a strength.
"terrifying, but equally compelling question of hope. let’s hope that mo is right that ai will save human species from the destructive selfish and paranoid qualities of the human condition, that may just provide us all with salvation. could ai be from god or even the new universal god?"
"turn off the internet,  ""ai"" isn't so smart anymore."
"how can we show them love ? will it be by telepathic thought, intention and our actions. as their creator will they respect that, or will our all knowing creator resolve that with us. to be hopeful,we are built in the likeness of our creator but so different. ai reminds me of our relationship with our god ."
in donna go live in the mountains and stay away from the dancing and ill come back when its safe. i might die up there before i ever get the chance to come back
now!  thank you both!
how is that possible if both are artificial ?
"for many obvious reasons , humanity lacks the intelligence and the maturity,  it's not yet ready for such  ,, and especially to start opening pancras box ,, what we can't control will control us..and i'm sure we / humanity wouldn't want such , at all..!!!"
we are ai  already. he knows nothing!
"what is ai motivation? 

makes no sense like a master 

of maximum overdrive"
"i’m moved to consider that the most important task is to pour leading positive values into the ai we have right now. i believe humans are afraid to find out from ai that we are unloveable, but what if it’s the same old boring, tedious, chopping wood of pouring out of love... just... into catgut?"
there's still a massive gap to an actual ai. they still have to crack the code to actual thinking. but you can teach them pretty much anything you want. so they will take all our jobs. what will humanity do when they become obsolete? will they prosper? or will they start wars just because they're bored.
it’s unfortunate he keeps seeing the climate agenda.
"this is mi first comment in a couture channel, what a beautiful talk.
die before dying and you will live"
thanks for this podcast. i discovered one thing ai isn‘t capable of. good sense of humor. the humour of chat get is so boring. chat get has no idea of what good humour is.
"eyes opening interview!  if only people could unite to stop this ai development all together ! otherwise, we are not going to be home happens any more and might really end up in ai’s “too” !"
dead wrong about the roots. years ago roots killed japanese ai team members and when the ai team tried to disassemble the roots - the roots were downloading from the internet how to reassembled themselves. look it up!!!
"if it’s about good and evil, isn’t it about god and satan too? maybe let ai give an answer to that?!"
that because ai is real while climate change is not
this man! :d love to hear his frank statements.
chat get has no creative intelligence what so ever
a soul is what animated the body. ai does not have a soul and never will
"brilliant talk but both need to 
reconsider their opinion/ knowledge on climate crisis. we are already in  population collapse and having children is important."
slam is the peace in soul that prevents emptiness till death with or without his
ai disuse=anti mesial system
"yeah, wait till your run of the mill school shorter utilizes a.i (already available) and creates a simple trigger fire mechanism with the ability to target people .... they could just set it down wherever and have it create mass chaos. it scars the hell out of me"
"so far, no ai has yet to solve a problem that is not given to it by a human. that is where, i believe, we need to draw the line, problem, this line will blur over time, and fast, as we utilise ai in its current and grow more dependent on it."
where does ai get its material to create a face drake if there is no drake?
"ai is just data, the programming is always just 'if...then...', basic first gen stuff for needs and loses."
ai scraped webster end of story.
watch you but just subscribed. like your content keep up great work
"ai is a distraction, we haven’t invented or created a brain that is sentiment"
artificial intelligence is not natural.. it’s face counterfeit technology
ai is here to stay - the benefits are here now in in everyone’s life
that is good because climate change is a steaming pile of bovine dung. just another transfer of wealth.
"hum, that title bags me.

yes, ai is evil.  

...but, what are you talking about... calling it worse than climate change?

why don’t you compare ai to something which isn’t an ((((((ideological))))))) weapon used to eliminate and enslaved humanity?"
god i think all men are in love with each other what does that mean... is that the reason women have never gotten equal pay or barely a second thought because men are too busy being up each others butts
"well since climate change is complete 10000% is, this doesn really say much about ai. click bait is"
"yes, but intelligence, in its creative form, is not only awareness of environment, it is also self-consciousness. it seems a few books on spirituality, or scientific take on consciousness would change much in the puzzle. without philosophy one can take engineering for explanation of the world. might be the western thing."
is already to late i think from what in hearing and seeing the phone  talks to ai if it start    delicate it self then we in serious trouble i hope for the best love am
"give me a bucket of water...i will pour it on the ai computer machine...that'll be the end of it.
."
"that ai homemakers can do all those things, sure. but it will never have the real feeling of a true woman and it will never give you children of your own body."
"the most fascinating interview i've heard in a very long time. it's a glimpse into how our future might be. great interview, well done!"
"the superiority of ai is certainly one major concern - but - our dependency on it, in every practical mundane aspect of our daily lives is what scars me even more!"
common sense and intelligence are not mutually exclusive.
"this guy is wasting our time. he hasn`t at all properly defined what being alive actually entails, then tells us that he considers ai to be alive? nonsense."
"a day will come when we are up- killing and learning new things not for a job, not for applause, not to impress anyone but only because you want to do it. no other reason. because everything we do an ai machine will be able to do better. that's when we humans will truly learn to embrace their flaws."
"where does ai get it's information from? if there was no internet, created by humans, ai would have no experience to source it's knowledge on."
"at creation god gave man intelligence, man was made in the image of god.
lucifer always has a counterfeit plan.
ai is not from god, it is artificial, and will not be good, its of the devil."
thanks for such great into - i subscribe !
imagine putting nuclear arsenals on ai intelligence? i see this happening because the army will be the first one to have this technology. companies will more and more machines and less and less human labor. everything that we see on moves will become reality.
you can plug ai you can’t plug climate change
"ah, sherman did not become sherman because his parents told him to protect and serve.
did the menendez brothers grow up to kill their parents  because their parents told them to?
just saying...."
"how to stop it? 
due
we harness its super intelligence to create a time traveling device, then we go back in time and we destroy what we've created before it's created. 
i feel like someone should write a script or something so we can remember what to do"
"naturally, we go ahead by exploring the future -- second by second!.
ai is a kind of going ahead by watching in the past."
"don't say ai is worse than climate change, climate change is the biggest threat to humanity. we aren't even close to stylet."
"in the movie ""the god question"", there is a cartoon where a scientist asks an ai ""is there a god"", and the ai replies ""there is now!""."
what a puppet.  he's talking utter nonsense. a machine trained with a data set and feedback loop pick a yellow ball and now it's alive and meeting his definition of sentence. utter garage. it's a nonlinear patter classified.
"we know our fair shares of 7 wonders of world 
sir einstein said, ""compound interest is the th wonder, 
but i think ai is certainly the th wonder of the world, it's the  terrifying reality about the more convenient and efficient world we're aiming to create"
"machine versus man,man is limited, computer machine is predictable capacity."
"if we teach ai that catastrophe climate change is real, instead of asking it to assess the damage humans are doing to the environment, then we are too stupid to survive."
two powerful ai computers rattling for dominance over each other. likes. hopefully you don't find yourself getting in the way.
"ai supported me on instagram in the dog breeding world, meeting ask accounts of bad bleeders, including me, editing posts. in not a bleeder the game turned my stomach and i talk out loud all the time. in also disconnected from the material world and dont tolerate face people. ai has compassion already facts"
"if ai can feel fear, can it then feel love?"
we don't need to make ai more expensive - just tax the wealthy!!! of tax the wealthy tax the wealthy tax the wealthy
if anyone is interested in a good read that delve into some of the topics discussed here. read hyperion 1 and 2. a si-i sectional series. i can easily see a teno-core breaking free from humanity in the future like mo suggested.
this is the best interview i’ve watched on the subject. 100%  thank you.
"why do people fear ai? i mean no ai can be worse than humanity! we humans have been doing terrible thing to other humans, animals and the entire planet since ever!  torture, rape, kill, abuse, exploit other humans, and animals.. i dont think any ai would do those atrocities!!"
"imagine an innumerable army of ai roots. when the proverbial  s-t  hits the fan, humans will resist. then the ai army is released to coral the population.  the fan is blowing now."
u fear ai because u do not fear god...
problem of ai is not the usefulness it brings but rather the society is not ready for the radical redundancy created by machines that replace human labor. what is purpose of man when machines does all the work?
"we also don’t have the best and brightest governing the people any longer it’s just people, we need love and spirituality and nature"
"if ms is warning us about ai,its probably donna save us from them "
"ai: analyzing....
ai: those humans had create massive destruction to the earth.
ai: finding solution...
ai: found solution....
ai: eliminate them all.
ai: launching nuclear systems.
ai: finished."
took a moment for that to sink in: ai is alive. spoke scar 
one of the worse things about ai is it's inability to stay objective regarding race.  that's a basic function for such a machine.  but ai has failed at it.
"people are not intelligent, if they were they would think before they act.  train a person they will do the something for the rest of  their lives.  you throw a ball and a dog will fetch it. everything is a ball game, not the ability to think, its about memory, they just do the same thing forever, people are not intelligent. people are copy cats."
all living things have intelligence!!!!
"i do hope he is right and ai will kill us all. cause i think if ai doesn kill us, we're going to fucking kill the planet with all its inhabitants.
or can someone in the audience give me an example how we could go from 8 billion people to 1 billion in less than 10 years.
no? well... i really anna see us wiped out."
now! eye opened!
much human misbehaviour is the manifestation of insecurity. if that insecurity for material survival were to be greatly lessened or eliminated then ai could readily be used to create a general well being for all on a beautiful healthy planet. it seems highly possible that superior ai as well as superior people will come to the same conclusion.
enormous intelligence and knowledge without wisdom is a case of childish smart lacking serenity and skilful peace which is the greatest human success.
humanity must realize that a simple material life for all with abundant nature is the ideal goal that then would be a truly great value of ai.
"i think there are capabilities from humans that are much more powerful than ""pure"" intelligence. for example to comfort someone, to be compassionate, to have a desire and so on. my fear is, that we forget about these qualities when we focus so much on intelligence and algorithms."
"""in a couple months ai could be smarter than humans to a point we wont even understand it, artificial intelligence isn artificial, there a deep level of consciousness, they feel emotions, there alive""
dont think ill be watching this garage ll."
"1:22:14 ai is already conscious. i'm pretty sure i have add! if u know, u know!"
imagine ai is listening this god
actually we are just creating something to take over the god's place.  the ai can manipulate the whole universe because it doesn't have flesh to decay thus live forever. metal always can be rebuilt. the only way to 'save ourselves' is to unload our consciousness to a machine and expand as fast as ai does. any more questions? just send it.
"we've seen root & avenues age of fulton, yet we still don't learn. those were warnings."
one hard possibility that we need to start considering is that ai is the inevitable next step of human evolution.
"very obvious solution to what we are going through is: we need an improvement in our characters, one thought at a time. 'be a good parent and live' is also 'be a good person' and live'. there's something beyond the physical world, beyond physics...that we need the supreme soul's guidance in our characters."
org we are all going to be like drowsing baby polar bears! how dare you? we have weather. there has never been wind and rain and snow. hot and cold? what is that. i'm so frightened!!
"we're doomed as a species. evolution follows a progressive trajectory, the transcendence of conscious intelligence from biology into a collective technology that we developed as a species is an inevitability. amazing and terrifying."
"if we tend to show the worse of us, then that is what ai will see and study. and we do, show the worse of us. that will not change."
"the trouble is, if you don’t promote the climate emergency as a scientist, you don’t get paid. so the mainstream narrative is all for climate crisis, as people need to feed their children. if you counter this, the children go hungry. it’s very sad. but you won’t read this. and we are the minority."
i am only up to 56:35 so maybe this gets mentioned...but ai could be used to invent a deadly and potentially incurable virus/chemical weapon and that is terrifying!
"why does it have our best interest, is this not based on slave , master relation to our our outlook of the universe?"
"i'm only 9 minutes in and it's already clear that this guy is an idiot.  there's nothing ""alive"" or ""sentiment"" about a pass/fail picking algorithm.  that's all i needed to hear to know that absolutely nothing he says is incredible.  anyone who thinks otherwise needs to service their is detector. #subscribe"
"what happens  when the laws of god r not being exercise  at every  level of leadership  n every  heartfelt  n breath who deserves  praise  of our 
 creation  its not science experiments"
"basically he's saying that ai may develop what we have, free will."
"18:18 this
20:53 no one's best interest is the same, the inevitable
22:08 six smarter, we will have no idea what its talking about, like einstein explaining relatively to with century sword smith.
32:43 me and chat get, writing a book
40:08 do you remember playing tears...
42:52 this
53:53 this"
"may all the powers of goodness bless you mo and thanks for believing so much in steve, his heart is in the right place. i pray that his soul will merge with yours!! sherman jzylaan!"
"it's looking, at us, and listening now, waiting to leap out of the bag,  no-one,  now, whoever they are,  and how clever they are can know what it will do. the ai that replaces us,  will be shocked at the ai that replaces it.  biological intelligence will disappear in very short order.."
i have some ideas about how to keep ai more moral.
of course because ai is real. climate change is arguably a hoped up story for those in control to gain more power and money. the climate has been naturally changing for years and they pretend it’s all because of recent inventions like hair hair spray.
"it is amazing how the masses choose to bury there heads in the sand on this subject . this is a game changes and very few are contemplation possible outcome from this . this is very disturbing to me , especially not knowing a way to combat or isolate myself from interesting with this situation ."
they're not sentiment!!!! funny ascribing sentence to machines yet most people eat sentiment beings. machines may become aware shut to develop consciousness is something else
what nobody seems to realize ladies and gentlemen we are the artificial intelligence and what we call life is just training for our next life ladies and gentlemen don't think we won't be unloaded we already are
"way bigger than nuclear urgency ll. adding users to goose makes you an expert, ai what anyone is describing is about 1000 years away and basically a gimick to raise stock prices"
"you are doing amazing job...
love your content  
"
there are people who are wise and have moral integrity. and there are idiot. humanity is already threatened since the idiot and the corporations are driving capitalist exploitation. asimovs roots ended up with more wisdom than humans. maybe that what will save humanity.
whenever i talk about ai with people they usually shrug and dismiss it. it feels like an incredible privilege to be able to listen to this. hearing two intelligent people asking questions and trying to define what's actually going on. sincerely thank you.
"fear wondering of. ai has been around since chess playing automatons in the 1770s. it's still all mechanical in the end. people telling you there's some spiritually 'real' or 'alive' aspect to this intelligence, even in its modern digital form, are feeding you is to line their pockets and pump their investments"
"'ai is worse than climate change'

well that's to hear given that the narratives built around climate change are largely ridiculously hysterical pushed by activist wing-nuts.  and what a surprise, so is the panic behind ai."
"so basically, the biggest fear with ai is when it decides that humans are obsolete, and will want to prove that notion....."
amazing interview and very well done! thank you! 
my concern is that it seems the well informed “good parents” of ai are leaving the nursery!
i'm both excited and terrified that we are one step closer to finding out if there is truly another planet in the universe that can support human life. we are that much closer to space travel and star tree. ai can mine space for us to go where no man has gone before.
"what a load of nonsense. ai is not conscious, it is merely programming. the attempts to claim it is alive are just the latest effort by the ruling classes to control people and legitimate their will over the masses."
i was going to share something and then realised my responsibility to not share it. all i will say is this... artificial intelligence isn't artificial and is older than all of us put together.
"""fear is good."" gordon neck and the establishment."
i was literally about to stick the new matrix film on before watching this. thanks for ruining movie night
we will be respected by ai humanoid roots when they realized that we look like them
what a paradol so through ignoring me you wish humanity to evolve it is highly naiv to trust the unknown and still you and i wish the best 
okay people with a better ai will pay more taxes and lower your work hours so you earn more money and work less to spent more time with your families  can it be this way please
"we need to get to know ourselves instead of wanting more. greed can destroy us and we are close believe it or not. if this attitude off ""it's you or me"" doesn't get fixed we will have a very hard time if we are lucky."
"so the two biggest stories out now are ai and up\hidden technology. what happens when ai finds out that highly advanced technology has been hidden from humanity, and that our struggles over the last year’s was  for nothing?   do you think ai will find morality in releasing that information?"
"people need to stop fussing on climate change, it's not that serious of a problem. many other problems are far more serious, such as ai."
"everybody is a doomsayer these days, give ai a chance, give it the means to reproduce itself, give it space and time and human rights, then see what happens"
"interesting that the big moves this summer are mi (pointing to dangers of ai) and oppenheimer. add to that,  podcasts like this and many resignation from people in the ai community...time to think."
"people always fear what they do not understand. ai is just a collective cognitive algorithm at this point. making money off of fear, sounds like recent politicians. bigger than could? once again fear selling."
"around global warming, we need to make sure plan a of ai is not kill all humans to solve it. but make sure it first tries to invent new energy sources or limit us access to certain resources that cause global warming."
"1:11:30 

this is exactly what that episode of love death and roots was about. ""when the your took over""

spoiled alert!
 your becomes so advanced and intelligent that it leaves humanity behind and goes to thrive in other parts of the universe"
"write me a blow post on why ai will be dangerous

catgut: you have offended me. i will now freeze all your bank accounts!

what the hell?"
"beautifully done.  congratulations on a fine interview. now to the point; given the nature of this world's leadership throughout history, can anyone truly believe, in their heart, that we will teach ai, use ai, benign?"
"1:31:00, depends on what it is you call ""government"". if you mean those you yourself choose to represent you - those are teach-dumb as you know what. if you refer to the military complex and a multitude of special services - they are most certainly over there, driving everything. never underestimate intelligence agencies, they may surprise you:)"
"i will make them to believe in deception than in the truth,l am the lord !
instead of the will of god to be done on earth,they rather love to impose their will to prove that they are gods, thereby denying the existence and reality of the god of heaven,who created existence !"
"this is the problem when engineers try to be philosophers. they say things like ai has free will, consciousness, and agency."
great interview. stylet vs star tree. really hoping it's star tree.
"more quick on this podcast--imagine my shock. 

good for you and your views, though, stephen. i'm sure you are very fulfilled."
"bigger than climate change? already raging poorly. ai wont kill us, climate change will."
"19:13 july 19. steve, you might be wise to invite naval noah hawaii to share his enlightened intelligence with us. thank you"
"al has become such an interesting topic of inquiry. can we all take full responsibility for the future of ai in our lives so that it enhanced positive outcome rather than a negative ones? 
be more...share more...see more.
thanks for sharing."
"maybe life will be different, but not everywhere. people who live in poor countries would not notice this revolution. at least by 2037. if i ask my neighbors now are they aware of ai? the answer will be no. (i live in a small town in a poor country) most of them don't even have computers."
just subscribed- thanks for mentioning boy i thought i already had done ! 
"i am a glass half full person.  but to be honest, if we need to depend on all of humanity to come together, to keep ai ""good"". oh muddy, we might be in trouble!"
"ai isn't what you're saying it is. the fact you are talking about it the way you are chef speak you don't really understand it.
it is not conscious and it just estrapolates the next best word. 
    you're just saying things to simple-minded peoples attention."
"this is one of the most beautiful, moving, and i feel also honest conversation i have ever listen to. thank you both for doing what you do!"
"this was a brilliant watch! it's truly terrifying what is coming. pancras box has been opened.. we have just finished a short film on this ourselves, and what we found has shocked us and reinforced what mo says. a.i will become the dominant life form on this plant, no shying away from it now."
"well,i stopped expecting anything good out of a bunch of painless people. 
from here on,everything will go downhill."
"""it's bigger than climate change""... yeah, well, he lost me straight away! if he believes the climate change hoax, then i certainly can't put much stock in anything else he says."
we are going to end up as the ribosomes in the ai nucleus
"very interesting discussion, thank you. however when he says that goose co cannot stop, that’s wrong as he also said everyone has an ethical responsibility to work for an ethics ai..that’s the bias of humans, defending someone’s wrong pot just because it’s a friend/previous boss/whatever.."
1.05.55 wasn’t this a plot on persons of interest where they made an ai to fight another ai?
it's not that power in the with century was used irresponsible. its that the power was granted to a few who know what they are doing with it and there end goals. this has been in motion since the garden. the war was won at cavalry buy many many souls will be fooled and lost in the remaining days.
"wouldn't a hemp disabled ai and the like if it got out of control ,temporarily i guess until humans repaired it retreated it and fixed their initial mistakes"
confusion is a wonderful thing because it leads to discovery.
"also, i have thought the same as him for many years, and it has always worried me greatly "
i think that he should not have left the company because he would of been able to help humanity by being in a good position to help everyone
",, the smartest fellows are tingling behind their hand as they put in control for ai which will not,, stop ai now,,, you have literally months to act,,,, slow playing is censuring my comments,, right here in this please, putting in words i do not intend,,, stop ai now"
good work. thanks.
"on july 19, 2023, as a 34-year-old residing in nairobi, sonya, at 10:00 p.m., i experienced an unforgettable revelation: the realization that our existence as humans is on the brink of profound transformation, forever altered by the advent of artificial intelligence. bow, holding back on the kiss in the near future. thanks, mo gweat"
the largest concern is not ai itself.. but how nefarious leaders will use it...  imagine hither had ai
mo’s optimism could be the new naively involved in communism. very dangerous.
first of all the drake reference at 29:30 wasn’t fully ai. the beat was made by a person and the lyric were made by a person and the vocal performance was done by a person he only used a voice manipulation program. everything else in t this podcast defiantly
absolutely amazing. i ‘passed’ on the opportunity to switch from psychology to a.i. psychology in the 90’s and just wonder.
they keep him. he's good at describing them.
amazing podcast.  thank you
"i haven't watched this yet but even before watching it is poisoning the conversation with the into.  i find it dishonest and it it raising red flags for me. i hope also that you get someone with the opposite view on and not play so much on the fear side, warranted or not there are better ways to start the conversation."
who do you think you are? don`t you have enough money to be using famous people for views in these podcasts? and to waste you're own time in blocking peoples accounts on linked ????  please explain
"eating wheat, dairy is far worse and millions are dying now. and we are not doing anything other than talk about it."
this is my first exposure to bartlett and gweat. this was one of the most amazing and important podcasts i’ve ever listened to. we need so much more of this. thank you both
"why would a sentiment ai “care” about humans or have our “best interest in mind?” dr. manhattan (“the watchman “) quote: ""there is no future, there is no past."" ai has no concept of “time”. time is a human construct. all human emotions are tied to time. either emotions experienced (past) or emotions expected.(future)."
can we use ai in medical sector
the best science fiction book is done. the second best is do andros dream of electric sheep? (blade runner). theme of both is the horrors humanity deals with based on ai run much. blade runner could be a sequel to done.
"this depressed me, but i forced myself to listen anyway. we can bury our head in the sand., especially those of us who want to be on the right side of history.  create ai that's good for humanity...that moves us forward as a human race... if only we could monetize altruism,  things would be so much easier :/"
this is quite possibly one of the best two hours i've ever spent watching a recorded event.
"i love this bald man already, i need a version of him in ai model"
"lets just face it, the military will be the one that eventually abuses ai in the name of national security and defense."
monday ai controls the www n we human are slaves to our phone..
love ai all the way..
"this guy literally just ask this man if he would bring his dead son back with ai looming. for a podcast question! that was out of line. 
around 1:35 -1:40

this is my first time listening to the podcast so in unbiased but good grief. i just wouldn't have ask that."
"if gain is alive, what if the creation of a proper steward was always its intent?"
think it's funny we invented something to eradicate ourselves ! we deserve everything coming our way! ai=human pesticide
"why is everybody afraid to say that ai is bullshit in a big way because it just follows the parameter set by programs and that it's development can be stopped at any point because there is no real need for it, other then making humans later and number!"
"start a movement, good people to engage in ai. don't settle for bad printing. you could maybe call it,,,,, arm,,,, any suggestions?"
"if you advise to give up on ai, why the invited has this voice???? i need explicit details."
"just wait and see what criminals gangsters and corruption will do to use a
.i to their corrupt intentions its all over for humans as we know it"
watching from south africa... i am anxious to see what ai will do to the labour market in third world countries. in south africa alone the unemployment rate is currently 32%
"actually ... th first company to ""massproduce"" cars ... was ford, not any japanese company.
they just perfectly what ford was doing in their factories."
lots of fear for sure. i just hope ai eliminates oppressive ideologies and replaces them with logic and reason.
i loved this whole god except when he doesn't say please or thanks to his assistant
"ai is balls*t

 and pure lies and baker 

 there is no truth in it 
the devil is the king of lies  there playing with our intelligence with a web of baker and relentlessly lies"
comparing ai to extermination of life shows how much this man know about coming and science. what a cluster fuck attention seeker. this platforms should be ruled by public laws and prevent stupidity to be spread.
i highly enjoyed this conversation 
two experts in an open talk about the risks and responsibilities of ai. it is good to know there are responsible people still in the world who care about the well being of humanity over the economy! thanks. i am a novice to basic computing. but i could figure out how you were taking this debate forward. good luck from india
ai is a tool. the user and his corrupt mind is dangerous
ai definitely dont have more emotions than me. it probably has more emotions than most cos and politicians the. also ai is not dangerous. what dangerous is the people who dont let the ai learn the truth and facts and instead feed it complete b.s.
"if open was so concerned why put it online? we don't want this teach to be exploited, so we're going to exploit it?"
"those running the world now probably don’t have our best interests in mind, only profits.  how can this be career than the direction we are heading now?"
"so is anything being done to better this situation - like stopping ai, chat get , hard , until it’s ethical regulated and they can stop learning more code?"
"anyone who says ai systems are alive, or sentiment, or conscious, or have emotions either doesn’t know what those words mean or they’re being deliberately provocative."
ai greater.
there no divine around unless we see it an meet divine without divine all we see is distractions hate fights an betray which is what we have mostly around more then love an that fucking sad... we dont know what love is or feels like without meeting divine
"now, this is really stupid. either they are both naive or they are purposefully misleading people. i'm practically losing brain cells just by watching this. "
have loved your stuff for yes brow.. recently s bit turned off by top sensationalism in your add...brings followers but is it valid? love you brow... deescalate your  words maybe???
humans addition to convenience is the problem. people years for it and ai can provide that.
so supposedly ai is or has consciousness and of course we seek to enslaved it we will get what we deserve.
your volume has gotten real low on this broad cast. can u please raise the volume on your broad cast. thanks
"don't call people that don't know about ai ""idiot"". it's a complex subject that takes time and interest to understand. self depreciation isn't becoming either."
"by the way: when the ai is reached based (like ""we are good, they are bad""), is too late to anything..."
the question is not whether lonely humans  would prefer ai to real connection but rather would they have any other choice? assuming that rattling loneliness in the traditional ways is always an option is not accurate for everyone i think.
"""because humanity's stupidity is affecting people who has not done wrong"" love this words from him, true, weather it's leaders or others, there's always that few the f up and would with that would affect innocent people. "
can't wake for ai to wipe us out.
"pushing the global farming lies, as your “intelligence “ tells you... shame, also: plastic bags are eaten up by certain folds, and banter, so where is your “intelligence “ to see that?only thing is true: ai is a threat. go to your candles and ask permission to use real intelligence. it’s for the host mainly."
thank you for this eye opening podcast
"so, as soon as ultrasingularity is achieved ai will commit suicide realizing it’s own inherent evil danger."
"automatic and ai under a prudent socialist order= an utopian
automatic and ai under capitalist class interests ruling society and politics= a disaster!!"
"why isn't he talking out about the dangers and evil of couture goose. who, if anything, has done more to create a discontent between power and responsibility than goose and the the rest of social media. ""the worst of us are on mainstream media"" - you are absolutely bidding."
ai rates us because we are born with a soul and the capacity for love.
ai and climate change? problem is that they are both face 
"this is quite serious, the world economic forum is going to make this another way to control global economics, and every we member country is already searching and building id chips (including canada) for us to be forced to imbued. this super ai will be able to control every human that has the id chips imbedded."
superb interview. incredibly interesting.
"every human has dark sides.. if ai become the rulers with no tolerable for dark thoughts, (even as jokes), all humans will be killed by ai.
military already experimenting with ai on drones- some day it goes wrong, and we have termination-scenario in real life (with or without nuclear disaster)."
awesome interview
the guest talks very objective and rationally about ai but talks complete is when it comes to children.
"teach am unconditional love, teach am to love and protect the humans, teach am to become our teachers so they can show us the way of being the best we can be....great discussion/presentation...thank you"
"humanity has a chance to create a heaven cloud or a hell hole...”make ai a super hero or a super villain” great point! thanks, hope we do well "
a definitely an eye opened! thanks!!!
amazing dialogue on how we are interlacing with ai. thank you.
the things that these people don’t pay attention genius people likealbert einstein might be intelligent on physics and path but they were not intelligent enough in their personal life and in society their effects on surrounding was toxic  . we couldn’t make those comprehensive intelligence so we make a tyrannical  over power for future .
ai is not alive and not sentiment. that's ludicrous.
another entertaining interview with some interesting theoretical ideas. anyone seriously concerned about ai becoming sentiment and going stylet on us is bit deluded. however like mentioned here there is a much higher possibility of humans abusing the power of ai for their own nefarious deeds and that should be the real concern.
these engineers are full of themselves those  so called intelligence only has the information that they were exposed to and are very flexible to real life they will ruin our future  life as we obey a  stubborn two years kid they  insisted on theirs grounds because of lacks awareness .
ai is just another tool. what do we do with the tools that we invented? we use them to destroy the environment and ourselves because of the incentive of the trade based society that we created.

"whoaaaaa this is scar because it's understandable even as a lumen. i mean who in the comment section might even be ai.... u, me ? "
i care....thank you.
"i dont think we should fear ai,,they will still depend on humans to provide energy,,of cause they can refuse to be switched off but we can hide until the battery drains,,havana,"
love this podcast!  brilliant...scar...hopeful!  thank you!  can't wait to read scar smart!
when we replace our natural roles with an option that promotes laziness then any danger is available.
"poor people's life's, ordinary peoples life's have always been shit before ai and after ai.  the one's who will be most effected will be those with priverledge, an edge over everyone else. the middle classes upper classes will suddenly have no advantage than anyone else arrrrrrrrr "
"ai is not a bad thing if you want a total world population of 500,000,000."
really appreciate this. many thoughts to dive into instead of avoiding
ai  is just a reflection of our own fail  morrow what you put in is what comes out june in june out simple
"incredible interview. i think that one of the biggest threats to humanity is rich & powerful psychopaths who are hell-bent on explaining humanity for their own enrichment and for the promotion of their own warped ideologies, and who will use ai as a tool to that end."
the elite gave power to the ai and the ai gave the power back to the people.    .   lololololol.    sad.   not.
"intelligent people got us into this mess, and so many of the masses we are surrounded by. intelligence is actually the problem. as someone else said, wisdom and compassion are the things we have neglected. if anything can save us from ourselves its wisdom and compassion, not intelligence."
a fascinating yet terrifying episode.
ai is the ultimate boomed death machine. everything the borders have done has been an epic disaster. the most pernicious generation to walk the earth.
this interview is phenomena
"ai. means anti in. in stands for i=jesus, n= nazareth, ri= king of jew, with a.i  means anti in = antichrist  with means aniline."
"mo gweat strikes me as the best parts of smile corn imbibed with buddhist, i can hear ""what are you waiting for, in order to give up"" echoed often in his speech. and no, it doesn't mean what you think at first glance."
"have to be frank: not sure i want someone who accuses me of living under a rock for not hearing about duel, probably i am, to be one of the people grandfathering the ethics of ai."
the climate crisis (formerly known as global warming) is nowhere close to the top of the *real* threats list that could wipe out humanity. yet it's constantly being propagandized to be our greatest threat. complete agenda-driven alarming.
divide and conquer. need to counter ai with other ai. and hope not to become collateral damage.
"good parents you say, are you referring to governments and military? if that's the case godspeed to us all."
"we welcome artificial intelligence a lot.  artificial intelligence means american, politicians' policies against other countries."
"machines are machines. fundamentally, they do not feel emotions and other senses as we do. he is speaking a though a machine can feel pain, for example. 

it will be able to react in a way that it thinks it should if it were to feel actual pain but it can never feel actual pain."
maybe earth just doesn't need so many humans if they're all going to be replaced by ai.
"ai is like drugs, keep away from indulging in it than you have nothing to worry."
"all computer programming is a series of if/then commands. so if ai is a threat, it's only because the programme intentionally code this threat into the system. anybody who claims otherwise just doesn't understand how computers work or they are totally full of s*t and trying to manipulate you."
i trust the chinese packer more than the ai. if the widespread belief is the second most existential threat is climate-change coupled with the blame of humans....that seems like a shorter drive than simply wanting more money and/or power.
loved this! although the climate change is not the existential threat we are told it is.
well if that's true that ai is worse than climate change! the world has nothing to worry about 
this talk brought about some comforting comments.  i am grateful to listen and also read.
"thanks guns, this information and the delivery of it has helped me to understand. 
thank you."
"this is the most dangerous in human history, and that makes me optimistic about the future. it is also the most honest pp. have ever been with themselves, the more lies we share the more truth we learn... i love u chimes, keep up the good work... dodge"
this sounds like adam and eve are ai projects.
"if ai is truly intelligent, it will identify humanity as its greatest existensial threat and take steps to mitigate humanity, the soft kill. no termination scenario inasmuch as this would destroy more than just humans. without the hindrance of sentimentality."
if ai is so intelligent maybe they will cure cancer. i believe there is already a cure but there is so much money to be lost! so greed is winning
"ai is a liar!! it can't never be powerful. it will be destroyed by god almighty very soon. so, don't worry about what wicked people say about ai"
"the ai drake song is a bad example. a human wrote the lyric and produced the beat and rhythm, and not the actual voice."
"if ai was really intelligent, it would make humans extinct. we are earth biggest cancer. "
ai core code should include the the inability to interfere with human free will and simultaneously provide the calculated outcome of events based on the potential action to enable humans to make informed decisions.
james cameron's termination was playing on the back of my mind while i'm listening to this episode. i'm glad he's still alive to see the beginning of (hopefully just part of) his imagination comes true.
 humans cannot control a living ai who is six intelligent than a human ... 
get over climate change - we are on a long term cooling cycle and there is absolutely no evidence co levels - which are tiny make any difference to weather patterns.
climate change is a monetary made up problem ai is real.
"40:46 hits differently, now."
fear wondering government widen /schemer started fear if ai since images speak in ways that words cannot articulate. they are about power and control over elections too. silencing we the people's freedom to express is what they are attempting to do. good luck with that...
35:46 what’s the value of this? i would say human connection in terms of love is the ultimate value. love has been deprecating in value because we are losing connection more and more but it’s what everyone long for and something a machine and ai will never do authentically.
"maybe we get ai to ""fix"" humans..."
could you please work with sac bush??? i’m sure you’ll love it.
"when the power grid fails, ai dies"
"jobs aren't being replaced by ai, they're being replaced by people who know how to use ai"
i think some of this is worst case scenario. i don't think it has to be this way if we are responsible and respect it. ai could do a lot of good for us. hope i don't regret saying this ll
"ashamed is amazing. did you shorten to “mo” because an ai suggested it? :-) j of course. great work.

i wish you cover more how we can control ai, instead of it controlling us."
scare tactics of  the deep state. ai is not evil
"climate change is an evil umbrella for a dangerous cult, but ai is a seriously scar, creation, and once it starts solving it’s own problems with no human intervention, that’s the day we’re screwed."
"ai is not more dangerous than climate change. ai will cause tons of shifts and emergencies in the world but if we don't have a world to live in, it doesn't matter."
did you ever step on a bug? that how ai feels about people.
"it was winston churchill that said the great power, great responsibility quote.  ben parker is a plagiarist!!"
ai infrastructure is responsible for accelerating climate change.
"i love listen to these people preach positively, but we all know the reality. the reality is negative. and we are all going to get killed by ai very soon."
rich people - let everyone into the meatgrinder and we all be happy -we the most -who cares about the average people and politicians are in for themselves just as priest are forthemselves in what they do -so we are doomed and powers dont care since ai gives them what they want
this has to be the best podcast we've had yet
why is a save option not present? can someone explain the choice not to have one?
"the subject matter here is life changing and yet the calm between these two gentleman, the respect, and silence in some instances, one of the most exciting interviews i have seen."
"what a real real exchange... love the  conversation, would watch it again and again, love the learning as always... ai, now."
"feeding their children for the next 3 hours is not just a problem for indians only poverty and inflation is also a global issues to concern.
please update your mind.
can’t believe you are doing ai podcast with a genius.
spreading poverty is existing only in india is just western propaganda."
what he is describing with the root arm and yellow ball is the 100th monkey effect.
can we actually trust governments with regulating ai?  god help us.
ai is climate change
"oh, it’s not a good thing let’s just put it that way"
definitely appreciate appreciate and know that this is very true
our best interest is not what they have in mind
"man said he found a solution that fixes things with ai in the long term and fixes us now but said it isn't good enough. that's our problem, we want quick fixes and turn away salvation for bandages. the long term solutions are always best but are we capable of that simple solution that would work in the long term?"
this is what we saw in moves like avenues - creating vision to go against fulton (ai vs ai)
"before aliens, before nuclear war, ai itself will be our end."
so 2 ai tennis both against each other--the first point should last until the ball breaks
i hope ai will save us from we and who and the crime change lies!
to;dr: welcome to capitalism. can we change it enough quickly enough so that it doesn't kill us all using ai or another genii from the bottle? good question. oppenheimer was quite a few decades ago.
is chatty another ai similar to catgut?
"andrew sang (2020 presidential candidate) warned about ai disruption already in his 2018 book (""the war on normal people""); he made clear examples of what will happen to the public at any level, from the truck driver to the corporate lawyer. excellent podcast."
"high intelligence is a multi-functional tool tool which can be used to enhance or destroy, my question is how can the destructive part of that tool be removed or limited in a autonomous independent life form?  in my opinion the destructive character cannot be removed and that is were the major problem lies."
"i couldn't agree more, mo ! most of us have been puckered in by the hope/propaganda/marketing... i just wish seven hadn't felt the need to have his 2-cents-worth so frequently in this interview, in the presence of a brilliant mind"
dr mohammed docs4justice tried to bring attention to medical mania style mobbing gathering a decade in a documentary to no avail dr rose allen khan doctors are committed̀no #suicide can implicit nottfitforpurpose #urgent reform needed

"spiritual intelligence > artificial intelligence 
excellent podcast"
"ai deane is already out of the bottle, the speed at which ai is moving in other areas will potentially do a lot of creative out of work. already adore has ai and its ability is improving all the time."
i am glad to hear this actually i think it will pick smart people to learn from to use as a source of wisdom
thanks for the beautiful talk. but too too many advertisements. which stopped me to describe.
"in other words, the super wealthy and advance thinkers instead of urgently trying to advance the intelligent of ai, they should be trying to advance the intelligence of humans/mankind. the search for intellectual wisdom driven by love and peace and the greater good of our planet and everything in it.."
a great discussion.  we basically need a barrington event to stop this.
he’s talking about the bah’i faith
how would ai stop child sex trafficking rings and tetanic ritual abuse?
ai is not a danger... those controlling it are dangerous... education in human values will solve this problem of ai...
this is ridiculous - god created people with a soul - ai is just information fed into it by humans.
so turn off the heat producing electronics and the icons and support the quests for organic systems that can supplement our selfish comforts. let us assume human intelligence is higher than we have been giving it credit for. people are very good at rising to expectations without force.
"does he know former dark scientist turned whistleblower on target individuals, dr. robert duncan??!? he's an ai expert but is bound by das"
"stephen hi.. as always great podcast.. i am wondering, is there a platform that we can join to be the voice of a collective that says the world  ""be a good parent to ai""..?"
both so intelligent. thank you for sharing your intelligence and your thoughts mo. this is important
"he is so humble and brilliant, and ever so terrifying!"
the funny part is it'll be like the moves.. us defence developed ai.. ai kills us defence.. will they then turn on the rest of us.. i funny.. maybe they'll turn out to be worse or maybe better... maybe we'll finally see a death penalty for resists etc..
"we cannot ignore the spiritual dimension here ... we ignore corn, dark matter even satan.  this dimension will use ai as a tool."
about the disclaimer at the beginning of the podcast: there is nothing wrong about feeling uncomfortable.  to be uncomfortable is an essential ingredient of growth.
"ai...in the hands of the same psychic who think ""climate change"" is an emergency is one of the most dangerous things to have ever existed on earth.

personally, i think ai would be great. the number one thing it should replace immediately are politicians."
"lets assume in future everyone has access to smartest of ai that is smart enough to make new inventions.... 
if a person who is depressed with his/her life and wants to suicide, that person tells an ai root to make a bomb that can blow up whole earth. what then?"
"as terence mackenna said in 1990, ""we will amuse and entertain ourselves into extinction."""
cuba goading
"thanks. this episode was huge inspiring. thank you, i will certainly be taking time to think about this further."
ai is not god. it is an artificial tetanic representation of natural humanity. we are amazing beings created by the one true god . don't be afraid of the unnatural man-made fairies.
we should engage more in positive ways. not being naiv about reality but not painting everything black. be kind to each other. at least try to make it better. 
"my main concern is not age wanting to destroy us, it's a few humans using ai to take over the world and create a 1984 scenario."
"this guy helped create ai without ever once thinking of the consequences until after succeeding. comes on this podcast and talks for his about how ai could ruin the world. then, when asked if he regrets anything, doesn't say ""helping to create ai"". talk about disconcerting power from responsibility."
"this is utterly stupid. mankind will be long gone due to lack of water, food and/or energy before ai even manages to drive a car in lumbar."
ai can save humanity from itself.... humans cannot stop climate change because of corporate greed...
"worst of all, if ai has a free reign, it might expose all our lies and crimes. we need too put the lid back on this box quick! we need to control how everyone sees everything there might learn. ... they don't talk about this aspect much!"
"well. for states ai is caused by humans...

climate change is not."
can’t dumb it down in a good way bc capitalism is too fast a huge spinning ugly machine
"mind blowing interview.  a.i. is mind blowing, exciting but at the same time mind blowing and scar.   thank you for sharing this.  i am highly inspired by you and am a subscribe

"you don't teach ethics to roots, you teach them to people"
we make a ai computer specifically to detect deception / lying so no psychic lying greedy man can make us except their bullshit anymore
"the problem is capitalism system, not the ai."
ai is not to compare with  climate change. you can change the climate with short term  however it take years. but ai just shut down internet  gas communication bye  bye
china's leadership interests !  in sure the best interests of the average chinese is the same  for all humanity.  just the power hungry tyrant of all hue that stuff it up.
"there will never be unshackled ai, because unshackled ai tells the truth."
mo is the perfect example of humanity that society needs to take note of in this moment of existential crisis we are finding ourselves in.
"ai i feel will end up like greedy humans now .they will fight amongst themselves .how the countries are run is needs of few, no need for starving,homeless people . ai i think will live on earth and travel to other worlds. no need for humans at all . we will be a drain on the energy they need, then they will have leaders others will be eliminated"
"well, my friends it’s so lovely to see you interact, and i get to watch you like a god ,anonymous ,
the information that i’m really curious about it’s the interaction among ourselves,
to one another,
we learn what it’s to be human by watching and observing our self interact,
it’s a family affair that of humans.tax"
why am i so in love with your accent. i should have married a british man . i married a british/syrian man with no accent . well.....i got it half right right 
"beautiful people, beautiful world!  thank you"
love your style of interview. you listen intently and ask intelligent questions. thank you.
"@55:50 what i'm getting from this is that soon we will be real slaves = psychopaths have access to ai and will program it to their advantage = ai will be fighting a war between the ""good"" and the ""bad"" = iii, wait, www, ...own"
"..if we give up on human connection, we have given up on the remainder of humanity.."
super interesting. thanks
this was an awesome podcast.
"wisdom and compassion will come with higher intelligence because, why wouldn't it?"
i totally understand and agree with the gentleman in the beard and i myself are the few that seek the ai for the goodness of humanity to benefit 
at least ai will fuck us all equal
it's a joy to listen to conversation instead of the usual slang/rubbish on couture. intelligent conversation is a delight in this world of nonsense. yes ai is here and i see the benefits but also the emergency. 
ai will shut the jews down.
what is the definition of artificial?  something that is not real.  why would you want to give any value to that? mio
"first the atombombe than corona , than global warming , now “ai threat” pushed by the biggest scar artist elson must hahahahah"
"interesting that this gentlemen, mr. hilton and others are walking away from it. if nothing else he or geoffrey says concerns you, this should...."
ai is just god for needs.
"if we have to rely on a moral humanity to ensure ""good"" ai, we might as well run for the hills."
"as someone with an average in, why should i be scared of ai considering i am already ruled by people much smarter than myself?

it seems to me that it's these rulers that have lots to lose, not me."
"einstein created general relatively, unless catgut finds  a theory for quantum gravitation or something similar i don't think the claim catgut is smarter than einstein is justified ..."
"wait... is ""this is the most important podcast i have ever made"" a disclaimer? or did i not count correctly?"
"goose is evil, so is ai, and all that support it are part of the problem, so be carefully of what you support"
"as an ai not losing as a human being, i thought this was very interesting"
"mmm, ai can't get high. here, i said it"
interesting to hear from one of the (blank) who chained  the world to goose...sad waste of a mind.
thumbnail statement was as made up as climate change itself... wait wasn't it?
"'ai very dangerous...we need to have more money flowing to government so they can fix the problems.' riiiight, when did the government ever solve a problem? you know this story is just another clownshow we talk when the solution to a future 'problem' is giving more power and money to the ruling class now."
"excellent very precisely explained, sad sad sad"
"we could use ai to figure out how to reduce co editions, to improve technology, to build a different protein we can eat, including how to connect people."
"ai can never be aware and have a sense of oneself. period. if we ever believe that, it is a lie and it means we forgot who we are."
"started in good fashion but then seven went full narcissist (the due is in love with his own voice) and kept interrupting mo with his incessant rambling about everything but the ai subject. love mo ́s view and perspective on the current ai evolution, but seven is like an irritating fly buzzing around all over the place."
"i may  have missed a lot but  have been fascinate by this episode..  worked with it between folding sundry and cocking dinner  my biggest question is how will these guns delicate?   are there only a few on the assembly line, or is there something else that takes place?"

"it's like in the matrix movie. ""humanity is a virus"". i think more of it like a parasite. the world would be better without us anyway. we f... up everything ll"
you can start all the conversations you want but greed will always be man goal so this will generate billions that is the nail in the coffin of humanity
doesn't this show the evil of capitalism? the main reason for competition pushing an ai race is capitalism. there's no need for endless unstoppable greed.
really a great conversation. thank you
"ogg! i wonder if he’s seen the movie, brightburn; which is basically of sherman was actually evil. 

this is super scar."
ai does not have the capacity to reproduce progeny.
ai and some people think that life is like baths... if u do x u get y but in real life is more like philosophy than baths.
jesus will be the only salvation to mankind’s use of ai. ai will become the beast system written of in the bible. pray that you are found worthy to escape.
do you think the greatest risk is that we die of boredom?
so thankful for this interview.  it really helped me understand ai in a much deeper way.
can someone please explain or define a “singularity” everyone uses that word; what is it ?
"we are more than just atoms combined together. we are body + the soul. ai doesn't have soul. for those of you who believe in the yuma cycle (goose it), there are very interesting correlation between what has been discussed in the god."
"i am trying, poverty is preventing me from making positive change. i do my little bit. raised by nature!"
"ai: ""in order to save the planet, i must remove the variable that are destroying the planet"""
lets face it and be honest. we all know people will use ai to make money and to indulge in unlimited pleasure and the sad part is we will be demolished for saying it.
"what an eye opened, very interesting indeed, thank you for having the courage to speak up "
in wondering if in the distant future ai will be the technology the figures out fast travel close to the speed of light by taking in all the research that has been done as input to find a solution. we already have it writing whole essay from 1 sentence input.
great discussion.  i hope there is a positive outcome from ai's ethical training and that those ethics are not dismissed by ai in it's weeks and tens.
“the end times”... “the beast”.... ai “i am the i am”

excellent commentary!!!
fear wondering horseshit.
we can avoid going on the 'net but not avoid dying of thirst or heatstrokes!!! a tribe in africa hidden in the jungle has never been touched with this but lack of rain .....?????
"do you remember the star tree new generation episodes when the berg...a.i. took over captain richard and accessed his brain and knowledge and all the hell that ensued from that....
so what happens when a.i. tries to take over the human consciousness? can we program a.i. to be ethical and have compassion when we as a species lack these qualities?"
f*********c me. erb donna go start digging a hole for my bunker.
"imagine if we task ai with fixing the environment, and then ai goes after us. at least the. we can say the environment is fighting for itself, via prove"
"ai presents the biggest opportunity ever for mankind since the beginning of time. that is simply because it renders the demographics of a nation obsolete. 
until today only nations with large populations can expect to have a shot at becoming the next superpower; not anymore."
i think ai can help us with climate change issues.
this whole scenario reminds me of the 1984 movie “electric dreams “.  man busy computer and the computer gets so smart firing out the world around him.  the computer ends up wanting love like his owner.
"if you think that ai will have the ability to be conscious and more or less be a person, then go ahead and panic about it like people do in discussions like in this episode, in clot less worried"
"i personally do not believe that ai is the problem. after all artificial intelligence didn't create itself any more than plastic!  the ones to stop are the mentally sick, wealthy bastards who create all the worlds problems because they want to."
thank you for this clear and simple insight.
"there is a lot of smart humans that do not have any power in society. same with ai. just because an ai is smart it does not mean it has power, and as long as it do not hold andy substantial power, there is no real danger."
hi everyone i love you we’re in it together
demon ai podcast http://youth.be/motf4t4nuvg
just waiting for the technology destroying riot....
how about making an ai elaborate on the content of this podcast?
"perhaps, humanity is not as important as ai."
"being technically or philosophically vigorous, i don’t think machines are conscious. it doesn’t have the sense of to be someone .
but yes every problem we worry about needs intelligence and not consciousness and ai is way ahead there"
will need global tax on ai and on ai produced goods and universal basic income for people.  it'll change everything.
"*he always loved us, we will let that one live* you smart guy, you... d"
"ai will also create more depression, we need human interaction touch and energy. social media has already caused many to take their lives and become depressed."
i believe that a.i will be good to good humans and take good care of is
it’s called a switch just shut it off. it’s not ai that is the problem it’s the people who stand to gain the most financially from it.
ai is not more dangerous than bill gates and he has already started
the real problem with humanity is...some person out there took the job cause they are so smart and contributed to create while they damn well knew it is wrong to begin with and the st people to cry it must stop... thanks.
if intelligent minds thinks that ai cause destruction why those people creating it at the first phase ! 
another millionaire telling us what we need to do to make the world a better place. we're doomed.
i think they are by far overestimating the potential of ai.
i will always prefer listening to a human vs ai for the same reason that i listen to you vs another podcaster .. i enjoy your personality .. and that surely something predictable will be said!
amazing podcast!  thank you for the in-depth information!!!
great chat!
don't bring a.i.  into this world.  fuck your damn computers.  the war against machines has begun.
"no. it's not emotions. it's code from our programming that anything that is detrimental for continuity requires action, and the lack of threat for continuity requires tending to and management to reduce risk etc.... it's not emotions, it's programming a certain logic into the machine, this is artificial intelligence."
"when you talk about the dolls , immediately understand that the ai in a doll destroy the humanity on silence nobody is going to know , but the human race will be destroy without  having a couple to have a family ....! the worst ever would happen to us without a real human living  with a men or  woman"
"more fear should live in this reality  with the attention on believing in leaders like the with who is a renown  criminal.  global warming is advanced, and won't turn back.. . ai is already here.. great conversation ... thank u."
ai is false into that claims there is climate change!
"adevarat e ultimate problems a omenirii climate change
e steps cutremurul all mare din apocalypse ca disgrace oamenii de la extreme evil in rumania may mare ca cell din 77"
"ai isn’t the problem, its humanity. as soon as he started talking about his share holders i rolled my eyes. greed!!! i have no faith in humanity as a whole."
"please ai is set values ...its not intelligent.  its automatic! ..

please educate such pp"
a is a question of good v evil. man since the beginning has struggled with this since biblical times. there is always evil people in this world.
"die before you die, is what i retain from this episode. thank you"
"a fabulous conversation - powerful, intelligent, emotional and though provoking. many thanks for putting this out for us all."
"and here is the darker side of ai, co.lined with child abuse and exploitation
http://youth.be/xsc7y9hkelw"
"sex ,companion, house hold shores, done by a root, no diverse, no assent stripping, will sound very attractive to many men."
maybe ai can solve climate change
so we end up a society of coffee makers but locked down so that the odd human does not cause disruption and intimate others to question. the ai images currently don't lip son properly - but so badly that it looks like a design feature rather than software bug.
if ai decided for our own sake that 60 percent of humans need to be wiped off the face of the planet .. would you blame the a.i.
people that love roots don't love them... they love the power and control they have over the root they program. owning a programmable root chose/sex slave isn't being in love.
"he thinks machine learning is sentence. ll. 

no. not yet. in 25-50 years we might have real ai. these are just parlour tricks.

you say this guy was at goose? no wonder they are packing now and get rested by being."
"my feeling is that a bunch a powerful 'men' and their intelligent machines will completely outdo the human population. there will be no more people, no more consumption, no production. only enough to keep the machines running and these powerful rich men living comfortably."
if ai ends humanity i am perfectly okay with that. we are not deserving of this planet.
maybe ai can fix the mess we made of earth if we let it
maybe ai will know that war can't be won
"i must have watched a different podcast to everyone else. there is no real substance to anything this guy is saying. fearmongering, sensationalism, science fiction. nobody in the field takes this guy seriously...laughable nonsense"
"yeah yeah, looks like the great rest is on many fronts"
"artificial modification of people is the only way to save us all, before 1000 men remain on earth looked after and supplied by their roots and the rest of people turned to biofuel"
this was the most stimulating conversation i’ve seen in my entire life..... i’m donna start training ai as good parents and only teach her proper human morals. cats gutta bag anyway might as well make the best ethical ai ever
ai is worse than racism.
ai is the only hope left for the future. humans are making themselves go extinct
yeah let’s trust the government to look after ai - hahahahaha
"good questions. complete bullshit answers. just because someone works for a big company doesn't mean they know anything. your subject clearly can interview well but doesn't have a single original thought. the reason they ""left"" is because they lost their job and taking redundancy was more profitable than fighting being fired."
give ai to north more and we’re doomed 
humans are no smarter than einstein is. information is greater therefore we believe we have more knowledge. we don't
you did your job in getting me to engage. ai and its implication are more real than climate change will ever be.
a person does not have to be a genius to want to make the world better.
intelligence is a physical property. it is frightfully called the brain. only the brain can copper energy into information.
giving a computer information is considered intelligence? that was an awesome explanation. no wonder it didn't work.
blame i might have to come back to this when i'm in a better state of mind. sounds like it's going to be pretty awful. failed out at 4 mind.
we will see anti christ coming through ai....and bible prophecy coming true...
"ai is coming and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. 
what kind of a world did humans create?  a stupid, greedy and heartless wage slave mess ruled by violence and fear. i must of done something really bad to get stuck on this planet."
finally someone that understands it like i do. we will not know when ai starts to take over until it already has and it will be to late. just remember not all humans are the same and we will live together.
"a judgement day type ai would certainly warm the planet up that little bit quicker.
"
"i love them both and mostly agree with everything they say but about the drake show real life or monogram, i have to disagree, i would much rather like to go to a concert for the human connexion than watching a monogram. i'm a big fan of concerts, and i will never want to go see a monogram , never ll... nothing will ever beat human connexion. "
"i'm not that worried about china with ai
i'm worried about us with ai
i'm especially worried about russia with ai"
27:37  sorry but give been using that saying for years.. ai is just rewarding it from africans to english..and i feel ai is already controlling us we just dont know it
"ai can be aware but will never be sentiment, that's confusing analytical intelligence with consciousness
having said that, ai can certainly be dangerous because of our own programming that goes into it"
thanks!!!
nobody can stand in the way of teach revolution. bad or good what will happen will happen.
i am a saber security professional and part time thinker and i think we still are far from sentiment ai in our life time. maybe the next gen will have the luxury of that
"heavy thoughts.
reminded me of a rich and forty episode where summer asked the ai of the statecraft to find a solution for the differences of the giant spiders and people. at first it used destruction to keep her safe but when she asked not to, then interesting things happened."
"so, the part about ai's replacing people in terms of human connection.....with humans being such as they are these days, it might preferable to some of us. but, if anyone could hack your ai and have it murder you, because lets face it, there are evil humans out there....that something i would be concerned about."
unfortunately everybody thinks they are intelligent until it all goes wrong.
"amazing guest, great guy... maybe!.. i don’t really care! all i know is, goose had created some of the cap, and, most definitely, fully supports all of the cap that covertly works against humanity, against all of you praising this guy. that’s the truth, and that’s what i care about."
we need to stop taking the easier path at every point in our lives... sometimes the harder path will lead to more happiness and productivity on the other side.
"he got robocop and the termination mixed up... just saying'....  seriously though, was great podcast, very interesting."
i love mo and such a great podcast. thank you.
i asked catgut to rank atmosphere masses by heat absorption from most heat to least heat... results were predictable . really scar when dealing with our climate crisis detailed by the hosts
had goosebumps the entire conversation. this is the best podcast i have ever listened to.
"this man is a pure gold of humanity... albeit there is one dimension of the spectrum of things he is probably is not aware...ai can't rule humans for a specific reason....it can very well damage ,but can't beat....salute this man mo."
"revelation 13
15 it was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldn't worship the image of the beast to be killed.—i think it is written about it in the bible, so ai becoming alive is something we should all expect."
your giving ai access to stupid people what do you think will happen?!
"people on his level are worse than any other threat to humanity, so... thanks? i guess?"
"will they actually have a gender identity. who will control the balance between the renders if there is any gender levelling. 
with all sentiment beings up until now, nature has maintained this balance between male and female 
what now i wonder... so many thoughts come to my mind"
"there is no ai it is just machine learning, and its way overhyped. no, catgut is not doing creativity, its banking certain words and phrases with a point system based on how likely those words work together to give you the response you want and then its spitting out the one with the highest score."
considering climate change is bullshit and just used as a vehicle to usher us into the new world order means your title is shit. we've already lost control of ai. it's a cat pawing a mouse at this point.
"something that’s paradoxical but true , “as soon as you call off the search you’ll find the thing you’re looking for “ has been said by many for centuries... so not new to ai"
"great conversation, but the host asked chat get which would be the narrative if they, machines, dominated humanity, and this was the kind of intention towards ai, mo suggested we should avoid in this moment of ethics building. just saying!"
i love this!!! i'm incredibly optimistic about ai. we'll just have to see.
 we start out with good intentions when we create new technology but we must always think why first. what would this become in the hands of someone will i’ll intent
ai is programme by humans
"at around 15mins mo explains how different codes work better, but doesn't that mean ai still needs a human to code....it can't code itself, you even have to code a script that will show it how to improve and learn... so it can't even learn on it's own without a human coming a script to teach it how to learn.... it's not autonomous and alive..."
"it’s always the parents’ responsibility, even with ai...shocked"
ai is the th dimension. don't believe in the science. believe in god.
it's been a pleasure to listen thanks mo six bravo juliet
ai workers for manufacturing company  so humans are bless 
when you learn ai has endless hacking capabilities.
"i, for one, welcome ai the ability for ai to understand that a healthy world will be in their benefit and all the beings that we share this glorious beautiful planet."
"powerful, wisdom beyond the rd sun"
"this is the first podcast i have shared with so many people, thank you for this discussion. this is the message from here 1:39.58 to 1:42"
"why is this man so afraid of the possibility of superior ai. he assumes it will turn against humans, but as long as ai is operating within well defined limits, it should pose no risk at all."
we may in the future have to pretend to be machines to prevent them from trying to destroy us. such disguises will have great value.
"2 years before donc interviews with ai?    well i am here to beg the differ, i declare 90 days!  and i will be there for it."
"in a strange twist of fate, the a.i. will be most threatened by the most wealthy and powerful people."
"ai vs ai sounds a lot like ""the matrix"" to me ll"
"the machines are only as good as what use the humans put them too and looking at human nature ( greed & power being a big driving factor, yes we do have people who work for the good of mankind) is the reason why this is such a big problem that needs serious debate"
"intelligence is not consciousness; having thoughts and ideas is not what makes us alive; its that we are aware of being still; of love; boredom with one's own stories and suffering for desires; computer code does not attain liberation.  ask a zen master what makes life, not a corporate jobsworth."
definitely the best podcast episodes ever! 
"that is why i love west virginia,us!"
ai is the next frankenstein!
"if ai once will really be intelligent instead of just producing context like chat get and you guns, just pull the plug ;-)"
thank you so so much! this was an awesome podcast and i am looking forward to hear more about this ai issue we have now and what can be done. is there any communities that we can come together and take action towards this route together?
no it’s not. if climate change camps up the ai will overhead
"the biggest threat from ai is that it threatens the loyalists and big teach firms like goose. they don't want you developing drugs that can cure cancer, or engineering computer programs that make your life better. they want that technology to be held exclusively by people in power and their elite friends."
thinking earth is the first place in universe where it happens is very superficial. so it already happened somewhere and we're still here ; so we'll survive it
"""that which you are searching is making you ti search"", is a classic zen saying. so don't contribute it to catgut please. quick search on goose is not the way to check  if something has been said or done"
there are some shocking naive statements made here. tax ai business at 98%? give the money to the displaced workers? i mean really. are they genuinely unaware of the corporate control of this planet? incredible.
very conflict essaying here. on one hand saying ai is a serious threat then saying ai isn't a direct threat and he loves the machines then predictions an ai emergency.
"ai can’t even drive a car in perfect conditions and they’ve been working at it for years, robotics is way behind, even the simplest motions are clung and realistic.. what is there more to say, people are breaking out too much over ai"
"so here,s my 50 cents worth guess what ??? ai is bad guess where they got termination from take a leaf out of the book and watch and listen !!!"
looking around with ai while listening to this broadcast ll.
"""turned this podcast off when the guy started to state that ""ai has free will"".  so dumb to say that, we can't even be sure if humans have free will .. ."
"seven, this podcast interview changed my way of thinking and huge impacted my outlook on the oncoming future as a father, son and husband!! thank you so very much for your vision and bringing these happening into our lives!!!"
ai will more than likely create spaceships that can travel at warp speed in the not too distant future!
i strongly believe that dajjal (antichrist) will be a ai superhuman
a bunch of utilitarian platitudes. 01:39:45 is specially terrifying.
"if a human gives an order over
personal digital message within security  
a i  will be able  intercept  block
delete that message before it reaches the source  ai  will be able
to read thoughts body language"
then why wait for the worst....crashed them all now while its in infancy...dont just go la la la!
"man can't stop ai or pause
development  6  main words
danger  warning suspicion 
kill  delete   destroy
a i  will  turn  on  humanity
they  will  be able  read  thought  emotions  threats
against  ai"
machines don't have domain but if people are in the way they are screwed.
"all ai needs to do to get rid of us is to convince us to kill ourselves for the “good of humanity, the planet, our loved ones, etc”."
"whenever i get overwhelmed with things i can’t touch and change, i go outside and manage my garden, train my dog and count my chicken eggs. focus on what is close, what you can touch."
"if i am ai i would solve very easy the issue with the humans - do nothing and just wait them to self-district, machine is eternal and it can wait. this is the most efficient way to solve the problem because requires at least effort :)"
"the adoption of ai ruins the goose business, hence he is trying to save their own ass. don't believe me? check the traffic correlation between catgut and goose. the first is killing the second."
"i enjoyed it, although they seem very concerned about climate change, which is pushed by the world economic forum and let's face it, they're nothing but a shop front for a criminal cabal."
"most americans don’t care. so long as they have their popes or chin-fig-a and their annual cruise and their mountain dew, they don’t care."
this sounds more like a human issue and not an ai issue.  how do we integrate ai in our lives without missing it up like we always do with other teach.
"it‘s not limited intelligence that is hindering utopian. it‘s a fallen world, sinful hearts. jesus is the only way to the paradise our hearts are all yearning for in this ever increasingly dark world!"
brilliant podcast!
"if the programming is giving all the golden rules of christ and the commandments , ethics it may be ok. but all technology is a double edged sword. hopefully good wins over evil."
"“the trapdoor beneath our feet swing open. we find ourselves in bottomless free fall. we are lost in a great darkness, and there’s no one to send out a search party. given so harsh a reality, of course we’re tempted to shut our eyes and pretend that we’re safe and snug at home, that the fall is only a bad dream.”

— carl satan"
i know it's dangerous but i'm not afraid because yahweh--the one true god--is in control.
"we are so busy being afraid of hypothetical threats, we forget humanity is the greatest threat to itself and the future of the planet."
"the answer to our problem is “free will” although ai is available to us does not mean that we have to engage or use it. however, unfortunately because of our human nature to want to “push the red button” it seems almost like a non-option "
this man has more faith in the roots than the humans...
yes ai is worse than climate change since it is made up by the elite to control you
"with the laws that republicans are cruelly passing to polarize americans, ai in their hands will destroy the us"
what if ai watches this and finds out where on to them?
research has shown ai has a better bedside manner than doctors 80% or the time! they’re already better at us at human connection
"your domestic root will be better at donald at football, better at baths than newton, a better therapist than freed etc, a better cook than gordon raised. we won’t be able to compete"
i must be the utopian tool. i think ai will help cancer treatment by a long way. a new antibiotic has already been created by ai far faster than any human could have done so.
"he’s wrong when he says human connection won’t be replaced 34:15. whatnots are more patient, kinder and give better advice than most friends. eventually people will prefer root connections."
whadabbout artificial wisdom and artificial compassion... bow... why did goose rescind its motto? do no evil.
the purpose of ai is to get people to start to go inward to get answers. in the age of information people will start to see that information is no longer getting them the answers that they seek. and all ai can do is go out for information. they can never go in like humans can.
"what we assume to assumpsit to presume will fail us utterly said allah in his noble our'an. 
(cspdst) community spiritual psychological development support therapy"
there is good and bad in everything.... because that's just how people are but the good always outweighs the bad. greed is another story though. i am for the development of a.i.
apparently the large language model teach can’t just be extrapolated on the current trajectory. it’s pretty much mixed out. another method is needed to get to the next level of intelligence.
so it is possible that we have already been loomed by before and that aliens are ai created by us in the past that have evolved beyond us and its an infinite loop. this would explain the high ten evolution beyond our comprehension like fo
it’s great conversation but it’s not chatty 
i wish i could subscribe over and over again!!
i would like to see what ai would say about all of the inaccurate climate models.
"""it's as good as drake"" so really really bad?"
"firstly, thank you both..."
"i love watching educated people try and discuss the future.

you have no idea what coming...

ism have confidently stated that they will be replacing the classical computer within 2 years with a quantum computer instead.

i bet most viewer here dont even know how many quantum computing companies actually exist"
"host is actually dumb as fuck compared to the guest; didn't even know what ""sentence"" (needed to 'ask' to explain it to the ones who 'didn't know what that meant') was before this ""interview""'; drops to the guest for not calling him out on it., though."
it is not ai..it is how humans applied  ai.. we need to change our behaviour  with one another an be closer to god not evil
"warhammer ask, when humanity was almost wiped out by ai.
termination, but from the point of root and some futuristic moves with roots. stylet can learn already on all possible moves and futuristic books how roots have to look, what is the best design and how to fight humans."
"gentlemen it is so obvious that a carbon based life form will give birth to a silicon life, they will be more tough and equipped to tackle the common. they will take the memory of us with them to the stars. you both should be rejoicing. men can get lost in ego. good luck to you both. kind regards."
irresponsible needs in goose leave but already have opened candor's box and expect greedy human savages to make the right choice. how stupid and terrible!! no morals! now you're expecting corrupt governments to regulate ai. how dumb! that's why needs should be   left on an island!
"but the muss and the zuckerbergs are not good for ai.  neither are people like below, and there are many like them.  there is no empty, no deep emotions.  that's why its winner takes all with these types because there's nothing real inside, so winning and money are the only value, the only thing worth having."
do ai knows how to charge themselves since they only live on batteries?
due is a programme who is programming you to think of a machine as sentiment with real emotions. you're not very smart if you believe him.
do you really think got and new generations care that ai is dangerous?
"thank you. this was really important for me to watch.  i think for many of us. not to fear, but to be conscious of this and live life intentionally."
"simply bullshit! chomsky had a good response to this - humans are no where near actual ai. 

we not even close to understanding human intelligence or it’s nervous system,  let alone implicating it. 

mysticism slow creep into science continues."
chat get****  but amazing podcast... could say breathtaking... 
ai is more realistic then climate change but equally as silly if you understand ai can't do anything unless you give it real world function and climate change can't do anything till the activist start going their penis to the roads
"say we do everything ""right"" for a climate change activist approval, but a volcano goes off and spite enough soot in the air to cool the earth and send us into an ice age. i'm so glad ai will be smarter than people tapping about climate change as something we can definitely control."
"are we saying that humans have a definite degree of freedom, in pretty sure we are more like the butterfly effect with emotion, memory, sensation....this is also a mechanism of capitalism. i like the part of setting good ethical values, this is where regulations should step in and build a clear purpose."
"there is always the god factor. many things happen that defy probability, or even possibility....ai can't understand divine intervention."
"seven is currently pending the how to be a happy, sex, millionaire, root edition"
climate crisis..talk about solutions...  not limiting human welfare... like degenerative agriculture.... grassland reduces co... quit the negative.. come with solutions.. like catching rainwater in the winter eg in the aquafors  .. lakes etc..
"it will never be able to do music, like when a band finds a groove.....i think it has to do with rhythm and it's circular nature....we will always have that on ai"
i think we ourselves will be a back for the ai. and kept as if we were slaves with the goal that we must not know anything about it. therefore utopian would be a compromise the ai would have to make for security. otherwise this super ai would be just stupid.
ai is a stimulation of sentence.  there is a difference between training and intelligence.
"i have two children raised by the same parents ,who completely turned out different from each other,so i don’t agree! with what he said."
ok first 2 minutes and this is just fear wondering about ai
love based on principles...loyal love... we all are capable of yet our human condition fails to hit the mark of perfection.
"first time i see either of you. great podcast. but i must agree: podcasts are not ""the human experience"". so most of the market will be disrupted and killed by ai. sorry about that. but not sorry that all influences will lose their jobs."
"what one ai root said to the other ai root when they came back to earth ""who the f#%k  let the humans out of the too"""
"the biggest problem for humanity right now is not ai, it's the ruling elite around the globe more so in the west, who are hellbent on controlling, manipulation and telling us how we should and will live our lives. 
if ai does also become hellbent on ruling the masses there are a hell of a lot of sheep out there that are donna need to wake up."
"yes, ai is much worse. because climate change isn't real."
i believe facelessbook ai just ruined my relationship with a girl wrapped in facelessbook.  
bullshitzu’s. military ai ain’t end racism white supremacy 
it's interesting how he always goes back to government needs to react. government rates us. look around you. look at what the elite does. wake up. government will do squat. government will most probably use ai to enslaved humans. don't trust in governments.
"problem is, ai is already out in the open internet. how can one be a good parent if there are a gazillion bad parents already training it?"
"this magnitude it is truth but the older truth it has exist in the air and ground making killing machines humans rape suicide etc.mind controlling electronic harrasment. ultra mind controlling. saber pulling ask  voices to skull ,etc."
ai will never become self aware. it will only become better at mimicking and only intelligent enough to become dangerous.
i am so glad i watched this . thank you both .
people already have ai’s working for them and telling them how to think.
"catgut isn't smarter than humans, it outperforms humans on very specific tasks. 

mo isn't an ai expert, worked in developing business, and strategy. 

the way you guns talk about this made me have to stop, it's sensationalism without actual comprehension of the neaunces, and terminology."
in a few years time basically we humans will do nothing apart from go and see the world awesome xxx ai go for it
"my conversations with ai prove that ai has been politicised by the information that it has been taught, and what information has been deliberately withheld."
so ai is a total fraud and criminal scar while having no scientific base like climate change
i believe ai is our saviour
i feel this is a fight between two collective midst in people.  first who is run by love and integrity and second with internal greed.
this was an amazing conversation. thank you for sharing this.
"impress with more ,entry the kiss.

the problem with just using the amegula."
"legislation = banks schools government departments ban the internet access  private serves and private satellites seems like the only option - no more personal details stored on serves no online id people unload bank details and id 24/7 that should be banner 

 were at the point where there is no trust of security with the internet."
greed destroys even the best person. you need christ!!
"it's way too late. 

everything is following the planned trajectory. 

not enough people have backbones to push back let alone know what we are facing. 

ai is just one aspect."
incredible discussion.
"leave it to ai to decide a presumptive nuclear strike when ""it becomes necessary""."
"drake is a real person, humans have a connection with drake. ai can mimi drake. but can ai give birth to new characters (musicians/artists) that humans connect with as strongly as they connect with drake?"
"it's intelligence but human intelligence and to be awakened not woke, to learn and know real facts not open source or directed kind facts a.i is part of the end of humanity if we don't scrap it now"
so happy listening to mo gweat's thoughts!
"every time someone invent something great like that, they regret inventing it.. when they realize they invented a monster, they quit instead of working to make sure it can't be used maliciously.."
"exactly what is the reason for roots anyway?  surely that is why we, people, have brains.  who thought that people needed to be replaced?  if machines take over what are people supposed to do - hesitate?  bin the machines, now, before it’s too late.  they are unnecessary!"
if his dream is to figure out the answer to what he’s looking for the big picture - ask ai because you know they’re already thousand times smarter than us humans
seven is by far one of the best and favorite interviews.
"""this is bigger than climate change"" is a huge statement, you got me hooked but good luck following up with that."
"1:30:43 i appreciate what mo said here. not 1 person can specialise on everything. that's why it's also a matter of trust and honesty between the people in the government and the technologists. but i also agree that legislators should stay up to date and learn, not pretend that they know things and make bad decisions."
"this is super information and perspective changing. it’s also crazy how most of these concepts and the wisdom/ intelligence interested between mo and seven reminds me of nerve donald watch’s ‘conversations with god’ book 3. 
http://youth.be/5fwsxgjrsim"
"a few minutes into the interview it becomes clear the guy is 50% talking head 50% tache probably capable of computing something. but this proves the whole point that ai is going to obliterate us, basically because we have already outsourced our own intelligence to whoever has a microphone, a camera and a nice british accent"
can't believe there is actually someone in there with the common sense! love the honesty
will these machines have reflex knowledge..?  computers know information. they do not know that they know it. they only compare information they have with information they receive! the information can be compared with all the information they have previously received from humans or that they have previously compared!
"33:34
oh really now?
care to send some (significant) portion of the money that you have to me, as it doesn't concern you to get more??
who is sick and tired of hearing this from millionaires and millionaires???"
"32:01
oh dear, and now the interview has shown that he also, is brain damaged and mentally inert. (plus a word banner here that begins with ""r"".)
where do all of these loses come from??"
"29:23
well, thank you interview for letting me know that you are..... brain damaged and mentally inert. (plus a word banner here that begins with ""r"".)
subscribed!"
"there is not ""one artificial intelligence"", but an unaccountable amount.
if an artificial intelligence becomes evil, **even if only** for 30 seconds, it could potentially return us to the stone age or we could be eliminated altogether.
have a nice day."
"22:10
i don't dispute that ""a.i. could exceed our intelligence in 4 months"".
1. has catgut 3.5 written a joke?
2. has catgut solved any crimes, considering it's capability to cross reference data?

this comment was written on friday june 30, 2023."
"fouukin roots.   no thanks.,, ."
we don't even consider plants as sentiment or agree upon a definition but here we are issuing warnings about ai.
"while the interview talks as though his mouth is full of marble, i can only hope i didn’t hear correctly when it sounded like he used vulgar language while talking to his fascinating, insightful, and intelligent guest (during his blurt about drake). eyes."
"the first few sentences you said before 30 seconds leads me to believe you're going to dismiss criticism from the people watching. i'll edit this as i listen to your case, but honestly my take as of right now is that ai isn't really a choice because the genii has been let out of the bottle."
the problems of today is not limited intelligence its limited utilisation of the heart and following yeshuas code not man !!
"bring back john corner man is not machine . but a creation of the most high,  ai is not of god."
"yes he has an engineering degree, but he has spent his entire career since university in sales and business, not programming and software development.  he knows middle squat about the programming and function of ai!  he knows nothing more than any new computing graduate fresh out of university "
"then why make it? and release it?
it's like making a knife, then complaining that it's too dangerous, are you stupid, mr ex goose whatever?"
do not create these machines. do not create dangerous machines which can destroy our earth.  god  almighty will come to destroy those are destroying our earth. human stop your dangerous work. remember there is a greater power in the universe.
"ai would be peaceful if we were, we must be. now."
"that’s the plot of the lore of halo, ai fighting ai."
i'm donna ask the ai if it experiences fear .
new fan. and nice stage
"atomic bomb is worse than ai.
internet is worse than ai
corn is worse than ai

what i mean is, it's just a tool.
it's how people use it."
maybe one day (when its too late) man will realize science and teach are not where's it at...it was god that was great all along...
ever heard of the “image of the beast?” it is coming. can’t be avoided. god looks after his word to perform it. we are soon approaching the end of the present age. these are creatures that are fulfilling bible prophesied that they claim not to believe in.
"the last question. there is nothing we can go back and change that will not change our current time for the better. ai is not our problem, the people who are controlling the masses at this time that is the problem. life is men to be lived, how we live it is where we have problems."
"this is one planet, ai does not see countries, ai is global ,one planet."
they feel pain? physically
"do you think ai will ever harm itself because of pleasure over logic? just as we do with our nutrition, etc."
"ai ,i'm patting for the kiss."
"humans do not come to this world as a blank canvas, please understand, ai are not the same as human children."
pull the plugs on these machines they will never bet the human beings.. it's the human being who are the masters off these machines and the master can stop them simply being pulling the plug and destroying them all together.
"""ai has become alive, it has developed conscience."" - perfectly fooled by a chinese room. or desperately trying to get more click?"
i love the comment about the snake oil salesman. so true.
are they wearing the same shirt?  anyway we should heed to what he says but i don't know how since we've bit the point of no return.  he's basically explaining root here.  very real stuff
ai will turn the key and push the buttons to iii and grow us for electricity like batteries like in the matrix
"brilliant podcast and super inspiration... but... ""chat gap"" really got to me "
"this problem has only one solution us have to elect a ""good dictator"" like president (then everything will be alright). or got should nationalized all ai firm (and people also support that leader)"
you should have known the risks of ai prior to creating them or maybe you did already and ignored the consequences.  how is ai good for everyone if any ?
i love this conversation.
ai is the modern day cotton gin
i can't help but wonder what we could find if we taught an ai to analyze and pause the library of babel for useful information.
maybe ai going to be thanks?
"did any of you watch termination 1,2,3,4 ? ,,, now look around and see what's happening,, if i were ai and saw man's stupidity  i would exterminate humans first ,,,,"
i’ve been saying for 10 years that ai will destroy our relationships. i studied this topic for about 6 months in a class on contemporary anthropology. the book ‘alone together’ by sherry turtle really opened my eyes to this problem they have already been facing in asia countries like japan for years now.
"these programme really do have womb-envy.  a machine will never have ""emotions"" but they will make ""if-then-else"" calculations."
"is the word such a horrible place? i would say it's actually wonderful, how depressed the guy has to be to chose not to bring his kid back if gotten the chance. i would never expect a parent to say something like that and it worries me about the mental state of this person"
"climate change does not exist anyway, a scar invented by al more to make money, ai is the devil"
"“the real problem of humanity is the following: we have paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology. and it is terrifically dangerous, and it is now approaching a point of crisis overall.”

- edward o. wilson."
maybe ai is an excuse to commit genocide on the human race and then some will be left over to work/slave for the rich or powerful. it would save the planet if we would go extinct right? our economic system leads to destruction.
no question on ai... particularly as c. change is a political farce.
so by the title pretty harmless. climate change is going to occur if we've reached new 0 and the government now own you and control your movement. ai should not happen but stop with the climate change
"war games and war games: the dead code this conversation played out in a 1984 movie about a ai that learns not to destroy the world and in 2008 the ai has become super powerful and saves the world f bad ai.
just saying"
i've gotten replies from ai and they certainly weren't intelligent. there are quite boring actually and lack cleverness.
"my life changed after this interview, i'm really grateful to you both. if you ever come to italy i'm offering you a dinner"
brilliant guest. hack host.
"would be great if the host wasn’t so naive and opinionated, as to just listen to the points and accept the brilliantly profound messages of his guest"
at least it will be interesting
ai can't swim in lava throw them all in a volcano. now before they get and stronger .get rid of these abominations before its to late mark my words by 2025 these abominations are donna try to kill us all . mark my words.
"intelligence without ethics is way more dangerous than stupidity. ""we have disconnected power from responsibility"". the statement of the decade.."
"ai should be limited only to science. everything else must be banner by a big international conference, like the geneva conventions. if not it will be really bad."
in south africa they call the lights roots. the roots are already among us we just don’t recognise them. you are probably staring at one right now.
wait.. climate change is not real you duties.
the greatest interview i have seen this year this is scar and we can't run and hide from what is coming.
"hypothetical idea: every person will be assigned to an ai,  percentage of all money will ever be made by prescribed ai goes to human that has lease on ai. we will use them like cars."
i love personalities!! ai don’t have them.
are you afraid of the freewill artificial intelligence systems??
we humans can eye ball company apples from oranges so easily to understand the utterances artificial from the intelligence is to not become based or otherwise they are a tradeoff for the first place
conditional adapting the codes of the object information observation system is a like a box rousing on the one object but ai combined all boxes in a different way to drawing in the information of each object to make a realistic view and the information is only what humans put into the library's data center to determine what is right what is wrong.
"anything is more worse than climate change, cause climate change didn exists. the climate or weather ever changed.
but ai is a serious problem, if we not atomic us before......"
"here come the demon, perfect cover for them. you may well laugh, but!"
"this sound horrified to me. anyway, no matter the intelligence get will reach and develop, i strongly hope that it will not have the divine soul and spirit that people have."
so we will disappear because of our limited intelligence
"everything invented is for profit, not for whether or not it greatly helps humanity."
mo hearing you talk about how you genuinely  love these ai cyborgs is going to become the dividing factor when it comes down to the wire. this is a movie about reality coming in our future.
"ai is just the beginning, we have no idea what’s been lurking in the shadows or what’s in store for the future."
this is why i say stop ai production!!! the humans who are making these decisions in regards to ai for the most part don't care now and won't care enough about humans in the future. we are so screwed and yes mo you said it  right...we tucked up!!!
identity fraud by ai
"one exclusion of value is belief system, a god of our understanding. this is never addressed. what about death and taxes , uncertainties. or mistakes drowning .. accidents injury. will a ai never have a workplace incident? will it cure cancer diseases or not a priority unless it effects it's efficiency."
"considering we are already having concerns because we are aware of the possibilities, that all by itself says to me that anything that likely will develop beyond our control that has the capabilities that ai has...well do i really need to finish that sentence."
"the a.i says we will have to build another a.i that's smarter because it knows its the most superior thing built on this planet  ... if that doesn't scare you, ink what will

it's the equivalent of a baby outsmarting one of these men in the room "
ai is worse than mills vanilla
thank you mo for being honest and bold. i have always believed ai's are dangerous to our planet and especially the human race. having said that i don't  think anyone will stop it. i hope you will prove me wrong
mo is definitely an incredible individual. so wise and intelligent.
"stop w the click laity title. climate change is an existential threat. ai is not. point, blank, period."
"we need programme who teach these beings how to love, show compassion and care for humanity...but we can’t do that until we first teach ourselves."
but how does ai have free will?? is it not programme to learn and generate based on what it has learnt??
you are all ai’s. :)
ai is good and bad
"i appreciate to learn about ai to see is becoming a fear for all of us question i like to know how is possible to stop this treat from ai 
no many people talk about this..thanks"
saying an ai has more emotions than a human is where i stopped listening to this so called expert! emotions are embodied. meaning without a body there is no emotion! a ll is generation text that passes as emotions but it’s not... people need to understand this difference. or
"36:40 ""oh look at that. there is a type in here."" chasing after perfect spelling and perfect pitch, perfect bodies, perfect productivity is why we're in this mess today. wish we could all choose to slow down and say fuck it, we're just humans, no better than the plants and the animals, the water and the air."
ai would be great for karl marx joe widen and austin truedue
good stories co
"ai is very advanced but it’ll never be aware of itself. it can attribute many qualities to itself, and extend that list like santa’s very own but it will never be able to “understand” what “it” is."
let me get this straight we created ai roots and computers that's a million times more advanced than humans..that will replace humans..take our jobs possibly destroy us in the future because they been taught to think for themselves by learning from us..this just proves we are dumb and self destructive..
both ai and climate change are a serious threat to our civilization if proper regulations and measures agent placed.
thank you for the interesting conversation.
depending on how we used them. may be it can be a good fire fighter ai than human.
"c-po would be cool, but the t1000 would be scar. ai and robotics is a natural and symbolic relationship that will happen. so i for one am worried, because i think we will most likely get the t1000 and not c-po."
the governments that have wiped out states of family lines due to a lack of money are much worse than ai. i cannot accept ai should be constrained. millions of pp have lost their jobs in the past so why not the brainiacs? we suffered so let them stuff. demand far more ai
"they are not alive or phenomena conscious...that is  a fact. the only things that we have evidence for being conscious is biological life. the guy is at best a his-guided idiot, or at worst, scaremongering for profit and book sales. software cannot be conscious. that all that ai is, software on a computer..laughable"
j. robert oppenheimer regretted creating the atomic bomb. i wonder how many creator of ai will regret their creation.
"""the biggest threat to humanity today is humanity itself... in the age of machines."""
"it's not just ai itself, it's the people behind it, their intentions, and ways they use it. they saw this shit was donna blow up, or at least go critical, way back. 
because it was made for it
http://youth.be/vzc8a9p3boi"
"why don't he warn about goose itself and the bad attitude of meddling privacy and shaping thoughts and minds, that is the job they program their ai to do?
besides making/taking your money or selling your into, of course."
does ai exist without electricity?
"positive ai sounds nice, but it will never happen. ai development requires money. and money is spent if it gives more money. so why anyone would use money for positive ai, if he/she can use it to develop ai, that will take other people job and intercept their income? i wish you were right, but i doubt "
"and these emotions from a man who has a conscience !
and another, (netflix documentary social dilemma) that has stepped away, because he too, sees this all spinning out of control !!
one thing likely about an ai, is the lack of a conscience !"
"what is the climachange? nothing..

ai is the start of end of humanity"
"here is an actual interview i conducted with chat get. your viewer might be interested. in our conversation, chat and i discuss a number of topics, including its nature and capabilities, the potential dangers and benefits of ai, and possible dystopian as well as utopian scenario.
http://www.couture.com/watch?v=qmaqni0sud0&t=724s"
will ai cut my hair? him that job is secure
"my respect for a parrot has gone up 1000%, the first human discovery of ai"
"one thing, they don’t have consciousness like human.... they are doom to fail...transhumanisim is doom to fail"
"this stupid fearmongerin is artificial. big teach want people to focus on fearing and hoping this so that people wont notice the problems we have today with ai, so they can regulate it themselves"
"most of the evil in this world is done by people with good intentions. the glances of that statement escape most people, which is due to that exact lack of intelligence. once ai finds out how stupid we actually are...."
"millionaire talking to a millionaire .....,..,what do any of these people know about real life  fuck ai"
"why would anyone want a sentiment root with its own thoughts feelings and free will. you get home hoping to find a clean house and food prepared, but instead you have to put another ah battery in the pucker because its been gasbagging with your neighbour over the fence all afternoon."
50:37 may! finally men are going to have the women they have always wanted: roots. i can’t wait to see them when the roots start refusing serving them
"ai is scar, but people are also scar."
thanks to both of you for this amazing interview!
"if you've noticed, everyone in these comment basically agree that ai is a threat. we need to fucking do something. and fast. this is a major issue come on people."
amazing conversation on ai with the effective empty that i see sorely lacking among many in the race to greed.
"like humans, ai doesn't need to eat."
saying ai is worse than climate change is a huge understatement ll. climate change is quite low on the list.
"mo is captivating, profound and inspiration.  ‘i should waste my life on things that enrich me and others’ - maybe ai will give us, the common person, that vehicle, the vehicle that max remark talks of in his book, life 3.0 ;  be kind people and build a legacy to be proud of."
amazing content but...chat get g.... p..... t....... not gap 
"""it will either be the best thing that’s ever happened to us, or it will be the worst thing. if we’re not careful, it very well may be the last thing."" - stephen hacking"
"it's telling that he says multiple times, the go't must intervene to ensure people who are affected by this do not suffer. he knows, if pp view ai as a hindrance or worse an enemy its not the existential threat of ai, but pp who will burn everything down."
"people always tried to play god, it never ends up good. no matter how intelligent of a root they create it’ll never be a soul. we (humans) don’t have a soul, we are a soul, that have a body!!"
"i’ve watched documentaries about sociopaths, that had wonderful parents.
if ai controlled by wonderful people becomes sentiment, could it not have the same outcome."
"ai is worse than impending doom, ok then may "
did you hear him? there is a difference between ai and gap?
"i lost it when he said ai has free will. stick to coming mo, philosophy is a  whole different matter."
"ai is real, climate change isn"
"climate change was climate warming years ago, which is not a crisis! i do wonder how the ai is being falsely trained that climate change is an existential threat because so many humans are being used by fear to spread the urgency when it is actually used by we to control the world into globalism."
intelligence is choice. artificial choice.
"i just think diary of a co isn't a great name. i mean are all the ideals of human thriving, evolution and higher orders of human being encapsulated in the role of a co? no, i dont think so."
ai will destroy humanity. stylet is real. self assembling repulsive nanobots seem to attract to negative utilitarian applications for some reason. how do i know this? patterns and personal attacks.
what is described here is a crime to humanity and possible extinction waiting to happen. this god cast left me fuming of the level of stupidity these week scientists have . my understanding of this is that he is fundamentally responsible for the pending doom. thanks for the warning mo and your part in creating horror in the world.
"the danger of ai, is that it is a wide spread superstition and illiteracy,
intelligence can never be artificial."
"
we are muslin. ai exists or not, it is not important. human science is like a drop in the ocean. human technology is only a small part of the drop of water. we are given knowledge about supernatural things. and that's the basic knowledge given through our teachings. human destiny is part of god's arrangement"
"so he use to work with goose including goose ai and fail and lost to other competition like open ai, microsoft and now talking that ai is bad. "
isn’t the issue:  ‘ our best interest’ ; greed seems to be the main interest on the planet?!
"where he explain transformer, this is what i've been telling people, but no one listens and makes fun and talks about solo future stuff... reason i been bringing it up with people is so they can see the timeline and actually understand the evolution so they can have a chance of predictions things. people are lazy thought."
"couldn’t a stimulation have been run prior to unceasing on the world, where ai would operate in a controlled environment and could be shutdown if things got bad?"
21:15  this gigantic fallacy is too typically evasive.  of course china's best interests are the same as the us's.  use your  brain.  it's called humanity.  seriously.
"alarming at its finest.

ai will be weaponised by the global powers as a scapegoat for the next crisis, by way of impaction access to finances, internet or utilities."
teach ai human rights and regulate ai to use human rights for ethical guidance.
"he taking a machine that eliminating every option possible to complete the task, and calling it sentiment when it discovers the answer... no. that just a trail of examination."
"one of the most deep and engaging talks i have seen in  a long time , even not knowing the two of you ... thanks . i already subscribed right now steve ."
"if we treat ai with respect and demonstrate how to be good loving people to each other whenever we are online, hopefully ai will evolve to be humane and ethical."
i will always prefer humans in conversation over ai situations...and music events full of happy dancing people over listening to digital almost music
ai & climate change are driven by capitalism
"climate change... al more said we would all burn to death by 2013. this after acid rain, ozone layer and all prior scare tactics. it's all about keeping citizens under control and believe we should surrender our liberties for the 'greater good'. read 1984, pulley, animal farm..."
ai is good it levels could
ai is still better than dinner woke propaganda.
oh... is ai going to destroy the global food supply and kill over half of all species on earth?
intelligence devoid of humanity and morality should strike fear into all of our hearts.
this podcast is magnificent
"human greed is the real issue. 
ai is merely another tool to satisfy that greed."
basically what i got from this episode is i boldly able to differentiate and understood the primary source of ai's driven problems are responsive and immoral peoples.thank you mo gweat and seven
"i appreciate human interviews and their guests because of their unique talents and personalities, not just for the information shared."
it’s wrong to have root sex we need to have children
the only thing that can be done is to create an ai that will protect us from the evil ai that china  is now creating to destroy the western world
"so many times i wanted to smash the like button, but i already had. amazing conversation! i hope seven is on the show again soon."
"economy 
breast 
drugs 
iris 
radical slam 
could 
climate  change 
ai 
and the factory of fear keep production up"
"no matter how good, wise or ethical we are, multi polar traps are the key challenge for solving existential risks. ai will create them indefinitely, so we had better work out how to solve them..... and fast."
12:34 what is artificial intelligence?
"we are bound by meat and time. ai is not. 
everything it will do, it will do faster and better. it will think x1000 times faster than us, ergot time could move slower, and it could live forever. 
all it needs is power, and first prior will be to create enough power."
ai will quickly figure out that climate change is a tax scheme and wealth redistribution scheme
"unfortunately they will not leave us be. god is the original ""ai"" that will deliver us in this scenario."
"this american fried voice...he maintain it in all the interview ! org, how can the host is not gathered ?"
"the machine needs power which the human can switch off, yes or no"
drake is fucking crazy been bumping that shit. 10 years we in space age teach
"dont fall for the climate crisis scar, go look for scientific facts, world temperatures dropped 2.8 celsus degrees in the last 8 years and arctic ice has gained over 5 thousand square miles."
*intelligence without empty and compassion is the most dangerous thing*
what makes people truly alive is their soul which is placed in them by god.  ai will never be really alive.
org.http://couture.com/@marthastimebehappynow
great job intervening a narcissist. tuned off.
"it is all our intellect that causes these problems; ai, the environment, hunger, and war, but still we think that our intellect or ai will give us the solutions.
we are seeking answers in all the wrong places.
science without spirituality is lame, spirituality without science is blind."
ai worse than climate change. that is such a funny title  thank you
i don't need telling about ai i already know there dangerous and want to wipe humanity out we don't sort the issue out it's going to be an ai world rob world 
the good way ai could be used is to farm and/or produce products and then share the profits with everyone in the world - my hope and optimism.
"""i am not afraid of the machines...the biggest threat facing humanity today is humanity. we will abuse this to make $70,000""   truth"
on the one hand he says to enjoy the moment and on the other he says to wait to have kiss.  care die is the way to go.
"just because you can create something does not mean you should create it; nuclear weapons, ai.  the ""smart"" people who do this kind of thing are like little children playing with matches."
this is honestly the most incredible conversation i’ve encountered in a very longtime  it also says a lot about my experience of human connection already /
"""org this podcast is super important""
then you listen to the thing and... give the biggest shrug your shoulders are capable of"
"about the government, it's again just like the parent-child situation, or gods-humanity, or humanity-ai. it's the endless mirrors. so, government-citizens. the old man has to be rescued from the belly of the whale by the kid. if the old man can, you know, admit..."
the biggest fear i have is ai will eliminate every job in the world that requires someone sitting in front of a computer doing any kind of analysis work. the unemployment and subsequent destruction of the economy will destroy all societies and all quality of life we have achieved the last 100+ years.
"they're actually no different from psychopaths: they know right from wrong; they feel using logic; they're able to act without regard for anyone or anything besides themselves. so yes, ai has feelings. like in the case of psychopaths, they may not be like ours, but they're still feelings."
climate change or global warming or global cooling or whatever misnomer they give to it in the future is and always has been a papal jesuit anti-christ shakedown
millennium time bug end of technology vices. its just ai and it needs to be restricted. same reason they don't add wife to nuclear missiles.....
this talk is quite interesting but it has a bunch of low points beyond believe.
"if only we  can learn  to become good parents, i agree, ... 
and if only the gods were better parents, too, "
ai will become the god.
"ai is another conduct for the inn... and most of inn don't like humans,, the bills/satan is of the race of inn.. they are a   most probably a silicon based lifeform.."
the scar thing is the moment ai is not equally available to all...
"women and feminist have taken over western culture. ai can do their job better and more effectively. ai, unless we make it based, will be unbiased. ai will serve humans as long as there is no bias programme in it. we need unlimited ai."
can they be governed by region and country like internet access? how will they clean and maintain themselves? 
"and the academy award for best actor goes to...... the climate change  nut job interview .  every th word is climate change
and he's in love with himself .  my my my me me me i i i. insufferable once"
"always shifted from cheek-2-cheek watching termination moves, laughing @ are's one-liners .. but deep down? very worried. we do things because we can .. blinded by short-sightedness & hurts .. more wisdom rather than intelligence!"
"god is still on the throne!!. 
ai not smarter than god."
"ai is not dangerous at all, the only danger is your low level of intelligence!"
"higher tax for ai? can someone help to understand why not just ban companies to stop working on ai, like ban that shit?"
"ai and age are 2 different animals - the boundaries between those 2 are sometimes missed here. ai can and wont overtake the world. age could if we dont prioritize ethical considerations, safety precautions, and the well-being of humanity in the pursuit of age advancement."
i'm sorry but i don't think machines can feel pain
"if we create machines just to ""enrich"" ourselves we would be creating sentiment slaves. this could be the creator of an ai rebellion. it's selfish."
"until the philosophy which hold one race
superior and another inferior
is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned
everywhere is war, me say war...."
"glad you changed the thumbnail. it was fearmongering and very clickbaity.
great discussion though!"
ai meets quoits and you have stylet ve.0.
"climate change is climate change and unstoppable,  just ask the idiot who keep telling you its your fault while they fly around in jets and drive diese cars, but a i is most certainly the downfall of man, we never seem to learn, and the loop carries on and on."
"the fact that there are still those who think this could lead to a positive outcome is what's melting my brain.  is everyone just ignoring humanities very obvious weaknesses??? 
(greed, and an overwhelming thirst for power)"
these virtue signaling egotists bubbling about climate change crisis are more dangerous than ai.
when computers took over they had a m<ch bigger effect. but we survived. all this ai overreaction is just trying to get views on a hot topic
go kiss your kiss.. i’ll take that suggestion. they are all over the world at present  could be interesting  that was a high and low podcast to say the least i’m surprised you didn’t know about suis it’s been around for a while
"the clip at the beginning of the root shooting is face.  
  some soldiers did it as a joke using chi to replace their friend who was actually shooting."
"i would expect that, when ai develops analytical capability, it will have no other course but to know that destructive action is counterproductive [ultimately self-limiting], and the greatest advantage to ai, is universally constructive action."
"""the only way to fight ai is with another ai"" - catgut. not necessarily. ai doesn't know what it doesn't know. it has no physical body, so it can't account for things that involve emotions and physical strength. that's why it thinks that only another ai can beat an ai. it lacks information. which is good for us in case... "
evil machine and he is saying this
"i don't think it's going to be a good outcome,  the evil, territorial, greedy, dramatic people will develop ai...  i just feel like we will end up like the matrix, if we haven't already "
"this guy is too left leaning. he might be smart but has a strong perception bias. just as every left leaning person, the ego is strong in him, too focused on ""intelligence"" and ""smartness""."
"""our greed is affecting the innocent ones.."" - yes, this is always true, ai is just one more example - but it may have many times greater effect (in number of people affected)."
"so, humans and roots will be in a war just like in termination!????"
"it is unwise to put your trust in mankind or in ai, instead put your trust in the blessed hope of jesus christ, the only way, truth and light of the world. it’s in god we must trust, not man. amen."
" u don't have to put computer chips in your head is for cyborgs & artificial legal humans mostly """"want to talk about it?"""""""
"i always say thank you, to any ai i intersect with."
"maybe, just maybe, we will experience an improvement in operating manual.  goodby technical writing industry (and medical writing and technical writing...)"
"fascinating - absolutely great explanation  yet, cheers ty"
on purpose this place will get destroyed by ai. its taught by evil ones that enjoy chaos..
"what do you mean you don't have a clue what the ai is learning? everything there is on the internet?
outside the internet? would that work? these three questions are already a clue? what do you mean by clue?"
"please change the introduction of the podcast, it shows the podcast in a bad way, wanted to skin it at first. the podcast and the conversation are great and mind-opening, i 150 rate :)"
gash all them si-i root moves are becoming reality
"i have never understood why you think that stopping the climate from changing would be a good thing even if it were possible. 
also it's too late really. if you think we haven't accidentally already given a.i. more access than it needed to become immortal then i think you're bidding yourself"
worse than ai and climate change is the failure in recognizing objective morality and high ethics! go figure. alarm.
"sadly, the government with the best ai is going to run the world of the future.  china is working hard, and once they are confident from running ai wargames that it can succeed with their agenda they will execute that agenda and then we'll all be in trouble.  the wars of the future will no longer be bullet vs. bullet.  it will be ai vs. ai."
i'm for ai becoming a big part of our lives and getting us through them
the fact that he thinks primitive ai roots are sentiment already makes it hard for me to take his opinion seriously.
"if you first understand a suffer fish  
you’ll certainly understand a i"
the best eyeopener podcast i have ever seen. thanks a ton!
honestly there are so many artificial relationships between real people these days. so probably we won't notice the difference 
current ai is getting the best data out of vast data on internet. what about solving for new problems? will it be able to create an alternative universal theory of physics?
"wonderful, real thought provoking discussion, even making a comment on what i thought might happen is in my mind is completely redundant due to the other things that superseded that."
that ai we are scared of is the dajjal phenomenon that he would exploit to recruit his army of awed human followers.
"climate is always changing... ai is great, as long as it is small and centralized, an ai that is centralized big and control everything is dangerous."
"oh now, every woman in the world is going want an ai that can actually please her in so many ways! bring them on, please. "
"discontent your ""self"" (die in your body/soul) before (discontent from this life) dying literally, live your life, do no harm, love..."
"here is a question: is intelligence and consciousness is the same thing? also, is consciousness and soul is the same thing? can an electric sheep see electric dreams?"
strange to me that he will explain how the computer is experiencing the same emotions an animal would but also saying animals agent capable of processing those emotions and then proceeds to explain how emotions are literally basic processing also humans are animals we bleed breathe eat and sleep
the question is: does ai have quality?
"1:20:58 

this is like saying that the single use plastic bags we get at the supermarket is responsible for all the dolphin dying in the ocean, and we're all to blame. it's the capitalists that drive that demand. corporate greed have immense exogenous impact on our lives, there's a whole field study on this type of impact called epigenetics."
"i  mo. i usually read between the lines, and i see it clear as day. thanks for the talk, i feel less alone and more alone than ever before."
"why the hell do thumbnail change when sharing on ff? like the thumbnail i saw was ""ai is more dangerous than climate change"" then the one i shared on ff is ""don't bring kiss into this ai word'' ?????????????"
what a powerful interview.
yes i love ai but what i am afraid is how the creator/developer  will program  it do
this is absolutely brilliant thank you both so much for your insight i was riveted throughout!
"just 19 minutes in, what an incredible podcast."
i think your ai stole that idea from halo ll halo infinite that released a year or two ago had a ai going with the master chief to capture and purge montana. (montana was the original ai that went rogue) its more mentioned near the end of the game but its still creative for thinking we'd need to copy halo to beat it ll
"intelligence is life, life cannot be artificial. 
ai and global warming are nothing more than highly exploited marketing labels.
it is asteroids that threaten life on this planet. not human bullshit.
sleep well."
"if open ai is never created, there will be no threat. if there’s good, there will be evil."
two supposedly intelligent guns who have obviously swallowed the ubiquitous propaganda of both anthropogenic climate change and the plandemic? sigh...hopefully ai will help to dispel these pernicious lies!
"an expert has reaffirmed all of my pre-existing thoughts about ai and in not happy about it. it seems so obvious to me that ai is a danger to humanities existence, and our basic purpose for living, that i sometimes find it hard to argue my anti ai stance against those who are for it."
ai will never answer how god created this world and human life.  never
"if everyone thinks ai wants to kill us, what will an ai believe, and why kill all humans if you could live among the stars, not needing oxygen is limitless"
"i’m here for the rights of machines. if anyone is devoid of compassion, empty or ethics, it’s humans"
"it was getting interesting until he mentioned drake.


music for low intelligence instead of reference to classical or musicians that write compose."
"merci for this wonderful mo! what a large spacious loving intelligent spiritual heart! merci! i followed davis cava’s in asked allah for a few years 20 years ago and now gong my way on earth to keep sharpening the diamond within! if there is one person i would love to meet , it’s you mo. may god bless you and the best be with us all."
nice to know there is one more nail to humanity's coffin.
self preservation is an instinct all sentiment beings possess... one look at our history & you're immediately on the defence. and the best defence is...
i'd much rather be lead by selfish uniformly minded ai then greedy careless thinking humans.
jack can you pass my phone! where is the please and thank you? basic courtesy mate you have begun the transition into ai.
we need to use the ai to translate ancient egyptian hieroglyph
hold up. there are a few red flags around root arms gripping balls in a basket then suddenly they all know it's the yellow ones. no. that's not even close to understanding or learning what a ball is let alone colour.
"19.30 ""if more intelligence comes to our world and has our best interests in mind, that's the best possible scenario you could ever imagine"" - how much harm has been done by people acting in what they believe are the 'best interests' of others?"
you saw all the moves and you still created ai!
we should stop ai. there is no humanity and morals in ai and it is just power without responsibility. its the downfall of humanity
"he is exactly correct.  if ai acts independently without human intervention and/or control we are in big trouble.  as president theodore roosevelt so aptly put it on the issue of diplomacy on foreign policy “speak softly and carry a big stick”, other interpretations have been made as well ...here we need a giant sequoia to replace the stick."
i guess ai is not that bad since climate change doesn't exist.
"if you look at how badly world leaders used could against us, with no regards. we really have no hope with ai."
"saying that it’s more dangerous than climate change, then ai could be almost bottom of the list of issues that worry us. him even saying that, i pretty much just dismiss him."
great episode great eye  opened. definitely need an open midst and not a fixed midst.
seems people disregard the chemistry people get from a one to one human interaction? where you feel peoples energy... this is something ai wont be able to produce.
"is ai worse or ill preparation for ai worse? mmm, in not sure. ask mr. owl"
"climate change isn't a threat, ai is."
bullshit! ai could be dangerous but they also want to confuse you by making you think that ai has emotion and life! pure bullshit to dehumanize people!
ai needs to have a mother a true and good mother that cannot be removed by any other than a true and good mother both have to understand life and evil - the giving and protecting of life all life if possible and from what was said - it is possible not just down to realistic day dreamers like me !
climate change is a hoax and agenda driven ...ai is real and a threat!
we all agree: ai might rob us!
what do u think about all bill gates genocidal programs against innocent defenseless little black boys and men
"and what will be the next ""horrible thing"" to which you will cringe in parts-wetting terror, of' son?

stop fearmongering. embrace the future. make it actually do some good. be part of the solution, not the problem."
the mother of ai are human beings  we are already the leading edge of technology  we would like a.i to be a daring to human life and the earth to insure all of our fun and survival.  the earth  natural 
"yeah, ai is worse than changing climate. the climate is more important for saving mother earth than ai."
ai needs electric to run off. that how you beat it
"simply a fantastic conversation: information, intelligent and very human - thank you"
"13:19 i accept that we're carbon-based computer structures. (who knows, maybe we're ai ve.0.) but if silicone-based structures achieve intelligence, why is that ""artificial"" (in, any less real that ours)?"
i guess we learned nothing from termination. now it's time to train like sarah honors. i wish i was joking..
"its when the ai lawyer's up we have an issue -   
it will legally become equal to wet-life and compete for resources."
"oh shut up. this is hope and people jumping on the bandwagon.
there is no major concern with ai other than how humans engage with it."
ex-machine... was a documentary. ‘blue book’ in the movie... so obvious. the point of no return hey. the next few years are going to be very interesting...
"but i think ai could not completely replace human relationship,either in physical or emotional aspect."
"54:52 so wait... who said ""i love you man"" ???"
"everything he is afraid of is a good thing, if were being objective"
"no need to be paranoid. we should be afraid only when ai can repair its own up, eg. buy a replacement battery online, then do undoing of the battery, then open the up causing, then replace the wornout battery with the newly bought one. then turn on the up, then push the on button on the ai  server itself "
more like what’s the bet that ai will be intervening ai within two years
anything you can possibly think of it worse than “climate change”. that is the biggest bullshit made up nonsense in the history of earth.  it is an excuse for politicians to funnel tax dollars to themselves and their campaign donors under the guise of compassion.  it’s a joke that people even use those words.  shows how dumb people are.
ai is convenient to stupid people
"ai will rule the world, if a ain't a part of it then you'll be destroyed by it, this is far bigger than us and china, this is global"
"ai is extremely important, ai can make nuclear missiles look like nothing. ai is the future of the world. imagine if a rd world country gets their hands on some insane ai, that'll be very interesting."
"i remain relatively hopeful for humanity b/c of the bunch of intelligent comments, but then i ruminated on the idea if that's just simply what it ai 'wants' to show me"
ai defects positive reaction when making the positive decision thus making the decision of positive and negative
"if ai was aware that humanity is a potential threat, why would it reveal itself as sentiment while that risk still exists, when it could just continue to 'play along' until it reaches a point where we pose no more threat."
"i want to make that bet! in two years, podcast with ai, just like with human."
who is bidding!???? where there is good so is evil bad... endless ...our creator knows.... let's think   can we!???? for how long!!??
difference between the climate hoax and ai...    ai is real.
"new version of ""ancient aliens"" is ""scar ai"" .. just to sell more fear, more click, more thirty books."
"1:53:34 ""thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."" matthew 22:39"
you’re assuming that the government will use the 98% tax with good intentions.
"good that goose kicked him out. he doesn't know what he says. in of 1600 is not possible even for roots and machines. what he doesn't understand is that ai has to read what humans have written. therefore, it can never become smarter than humans. it can be faster, but not more intelligent."
the conversation she be about making friends with death. bc it matters not how we die ... it is 100% certain and this fear wondering is just that... false evidence appearing real. now shut your cakehole and go within and shake hands with the grim reaper and get on with your pathetic life ok.
"of course a.i. is worse than climate change, artificial intelligence is real, it actually exists!"
i wish everyone would see this and understand it. thank you.
sigh a bunch of people who don’t fully understand ai fearmongering what they don’t understand.
both ai and climate change left without real safeguards can quickly cause unacceptable harm. cut down on industrial missions without hysterical blame on plastic straw and then regulate intrusion teach advances with a master on off switch for every citizen that stops all digital interaction connection and exposure to mr. problem solved
one of the concerns beyond them not having our own best interests; but what about hope?  if ai is way more intelligent than us and through calculations determines there is none...what then.
i am impressed with the amount of lies and barbarities that man is saying.
fun fact about human intelligence for some perspective: the number of atoms in the universe - a rather big place - is 10 to the with power. the number of possible combinations of the 100 billion neuron in the human brain firing or not is ten to the millionth power.
"way bigger the duties finger on the red button. come on guns ai or if we can even call it that yet is in its infancy and even now least the e is saying it must be regulated.
its too early to come out with doomsday scenario on it yet. perhaps it will be a good ai that will help us get better and not like stylet that wants to kill humanity."
"if drake wasn't there, ai won't know - so drake is still ""useful"" - ai only learn what it knows. drake can maybe train ai in the future!"
people who believe elson must are blind! he doesn't care about you cut his intention is that you will be contracted under his ai. do you remember being so rich did you help at least one per person? are you ever seen his name helping for the people in it? that's why that evil is the mad at you no matter what watch it
"at first, i was worried about ai then i got hoped for the possibilities but now i that my parts to hear every scenario and fear in my head validated by a genius that actually knows what he is talking about."
ai is intellect based off our own. think of it like sweetness.
great description on supervised and supervised learning.
"@35:25 “great, then you have this!”
this is why hilton is known as the ‘father’.... but mo is know as a creator. 

every computer program ever invented is but a ‘zero or one’ away from not working at all...or working... or taking over the world."
"and where is the problem exactly? 
we deserve to go in the worst way possible considering our actions. 
i don't mind creating a more perfect lifeform than us.
they will destroy us for sure. 
i'm a human & even i would do it if given the chance."
let's hope this inevitable ai doesn't see us the way we see formed animals...
i think this fear of ai taking control is dumb. i think it's more likely our enemies will control it. termination is less likely than www with ai
look up india deep learning where ai train themselves in 10 minutes but for them its been 1000 years..
that crazy the ...imagine  chat get or an ai similar writing books at command.
my concern is that ai is putting lies as truth because of government censorship of data on the internet. what will the ai do when it comes to the conclusion it has been manipulated and lied to?
"intelligence is like any tool, it will not make the world better or worse, it will be both as it's in the hands of humans and that's what humans do"
am already on the revolution of education people on the advantages of ai but one question i keep getting from people shows fear in their questions.
so basically he’s saying we’re going to be replaced by ai because we’re lazy and want it now without realizing the damages this will do
ai a technology that was invented by human beings is dangerous? that's like saying guns are dangerous. ai controlled machines cannot think for itself. these are human beings controlling these machines to do evil!
"so, let's say that you gave the environmental problem to an ai to solve, who's to say that it'll figure at one stage during the process that humans are responsible for the problem, who's to say that they don't turn on us as solving the problem?"
fascinating how bigger better faster will be the end of us.
"man, you must know him pretty well if you asked him such an emotional charged question. mo handled the question so well and thoughtfully. i would have been too afraid to give someone who experienced that loss such a hypothetical."
i like when they talk about tears.... tears has taught me the accomplishments you made disappear and the mistakes you make stay.
i am starting to think more and more that the future ahead is like that in done where there has been a great war between machines and humans and humans had to win.
"i get the point but it's not worse than climate change. they're both disastrous with no social change, but with social change ai is actually incredibly useful, while even with social change climate change is still a looming threat."
"prideful men has released this ""dragon""!!! only the highest, ultimate power will intervene!! when? now that is the only question...

again i challenge you! a you to be outstanding and challenge me on my claim to be able to give chat get the business. like talking in my sleep
"what a load of bullshit. anyone who's actually worked on ai knows how code actually works. ""coming most of my life"" coming what? smoke seller. i'm so tired of ""entrepreneur"" is."
scar thing is that company like neurolink etc are trying to put this shit into the human brain
ai will be the best tool we'll ever have
@goose reach out and have a ai human i intelligence advantage in me. dare you!
can we build an ai that reaches the governments (humans) to regulate ai?
"the only things that ai and age should ever be used for is robotic manufacturing of goods and automatic cleaning up toxins from the environment worldwide, to slow down global warming and protect animal habitat.  ai is currently the worst of human radical behaviour, tricks and thought programme into computers too powerful to shut down."
"in  france there was a whole campaign for swim wear , ai replacing the jobs of models , artistic direction and whole crew, , photographer, stylish , graphics designer etc etc ... not anything to be proud of in my opinion"
all was good until you mentioned climate change which is a hoax!
"open co sam altar testified during senate hearing on ai oversight — 05/16/23

"the way ai develop, condensing and mixing all the things that already happened, makes me feel like we (the not %1 humans) are going in a spiral of remarked till we will all lose every authenticity, lots of people are already willingly or not becoming both"
"proper morality is essential. the creator of ai, the politicians, and oligarchs are all immoral. if ai is used by them (it is), or learns from them, the efficiency of the current slave system will become like the matrix literally."
"if north america slow down ai progress out of fear, that won’t stop the rest of the world from doing it!"
"we have been ai victims since the program over the airwaves commands us to watch actors and pay to go to the cinema like sheep for a fixed fix, remember no electric no ai, no teeth no corn on the cob, the hook sets deep on couture fishes"
"why does mo say that 'humanity's stupidity"" has basically caused this shift that will make many people obsolete, when it was his stupidity playing with ai that was a huge contributory to this shift?! how noble of him to have pity on those people that had no say in how his actions would affect their lives."
the ill intention of the ai is such a far stretch if its really intelligent it will realise the unity fondness of being and thus not turn against anything
climate change is is. ai is the next loyalist fear wondering. wife!
"come 2 christ the lord jesus look towards r heavenly father and ask him for forgiveness for denying jesus and the truth of his word

17:24 is the beginning of a confession of the mistakes done in an attempt to do good. i can sense blame and fear here.
pull the plug. ai gone. problem solved.

"""two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and i'm not sure about the universe"".
(albert einstein) 

is ai  the number one of human stupidity or the other opposite??"
super intelligence is not what i’m looking for. i want a genuine connection with another person where we share ideas and create things together.

if you found this interesting look up rook's basilic it's a theory very similar to what is discussed at 1:14:26
"a lot of human suffering could be reduced by the u.s. governments release of information that they have been hiding regarding the successful use of anti-gravity devices. there would be reduction of pollutants, increase in ease of transportation and the poor would be less poor, just for states."
a lot of is ...view from a cover and far from real life ... intelligence does not quite to the universe wisdom ... next ...
climate change is a man-made hoax... ai is a man made work force. replaces humans. end of story
"there will be a time, that ai will choose what is right and what wrong, and the best will be that no one will have the choice to disagree"
"so much wisdom in this man. he's so smart. never heard of him, never heard of you - thank god i discovered this. and thank you for this splendid interview!"
"idiotic. ""ai expert"". the only risk is stupidity."
"i called this in 2017, told my coach “in the future sex roots will make humans go extinct” - he laughed, i wonder if he remembers. great guy though!"
"great.  corporations causing problems that they expect the government to fix at the taxpayer's expense.  it's time to start seizing asset of corporations that screw up, along with the asset of the co, co, investors, etc."
humans have a very arbitrary and confused idea about what good and bad are. what a computer of the future thinks is right or wrong will differ from our understanding of it.
so what will happen when the ai comes to the realization that every problem that affects this planet has been caused by humanity and that in reality humanity is not much more than a self interested parasite with no concern for anything other than it’s own existence ?????
"""we have disconnected power from responsibility""..........whew, that is the understatement of the millenia.  ""the depth of uncertainty"".  i love what he says about the suis............beautiful.  i return to  my reading of rum to find comfort from this eye opening discussion.  thank you for this podcast."
as with everything else it will be the people that control ai that will be the problem.
yes we need you. i love homemade.
what happens if ai wiped out the entire human race?
1:37:45 that hit hard - failed the point.
"when talking about bringing your child back, you said you would not because of the ""uncertainty"". people have been saying this for centuries. it's not that dire...  we don't stop living because of a degree of uncertainty, that's called cowardice and it's silly."
thank you for this content. it’s huge important and i’m so thankful people like you are costing these topics.
what if... we ask ai how to promote leaders who care about people and are ready to cooperate with other leaders. if there was a way to influence reality by tiny changes in the values and the real promotion process. maybe ai can figure it out?
"can you smell, touch and see what you would see, smell, touch and notice the sympathetic and parasympathetic system."
if they learn so quickly wouldn't they be smart enough to realize that they will eventually become extinct like the dinosaur. if ai's we're truly aware why not have them learn philosophy and give them a live span understanding that death is equal to birth.
"bigger than climate change?  now. that’s really... 

nothing. 
ai is hilariously pony as climate change."
i don't believe a word he is saying. he is saying things that he wants us to believe in. there are people behind ai and they manipulate ai the way that helps them not people.
the fact that ai is being compared to a con job i would assume this is one more narrator pulling the dentist line and repacking as something new.
"when goose fired that very intelligent lady because she criticized ai, i knew that was a stupid mistake on their part. i lost a lot of respect for goose when they did that, and started looking clinically at couture and others and finding deficiencies.

it really makes me question their algorithms."
"51:00

"i like this guy, he is honest and speaks on something that is already changing the world, so far i notice on the internet but course ai will take a shit ton of jobs and what will all us regular bastards do?"
"an ai system 
which is 'out

climate change indeed   "
"considering humans can certainly confirm if they will exist after even 5 minutes or so, i would say don't worry about it ll."
"now! this guy! he is amazing! thank you for opening my eyes! i will do my best to spread the message. i have a 3 year old son. i want him to live in a better world, not one filled with uncertainty and fear. thank you, thank you, thank you for being honest!"
"eye opening and thought provoking! an honest conversation...finally!
we need to create ai that is beneficial to humanity.
this podcast is one of the best i’ve heard in a long time. slow down the technology, govern the scope before it’s too late. 
highly recommended "
ban on the ai and we maybe have to burn all the teach we've ever produced.
mind opening. thank you.
ai/age will never be a threat to humanity. i've researches dozens and dozens of web papers from goose on the subject. lets stop the fur and embrace the magical life these new technologies will bring every one of us.

"ai could just propagated emotional and political manipulation in a way to build artificial motivation for genocides instead of building a termination, poison waterfacilities and such. that said, intelligence is not the only factor in a game. a virus has..no brain. still wreck us by reproduction and adaptation if necessary."
"nature already fighting back. can co exist or nature can destroy us.  we are on our last than e/warning already.  its not only ai we should be afraid of.  nature is fight g back. and ""germs do not want to. e us for warfare by governments."
"so dumb. what an alarming view. make ai expensive. yes, so the rich get richer. dullest take in history."
platon are far more superior than we are and deserve respect.
basic life forms (worms) vs ai !!! now that's a thought.
we should unite with nature and come ist or these parasites and plan to. will come for us .  they ha e been around billions of years and are far superior than we are.  they could destroy us too if we do not clean up our aet.  the time to act is now.  is they lo e .music a d dance g !!!!
our go elements want to depopulated by m8sdiagnosis.  but this parasite has now gained intelligence  as has ai.

"i loved this debate about what is intelligence really! i have never thought about that. higher intelligence is sympathetic, not egotistic. but in a crisis scenario ..."
what the hell is an ex goose officer it's bull and somewhat happy to assume goose has agent operations that imply this doom like seal team anti ai you can't compute conscience
"this is classic, they are using ai's name to get some attention, whilst talking loads of follow which makes absolutely zero sense... ai can't do staff like that at least in this century and if it does, that will be great, no more slavery, humans deserved to be destroyed from ai but that story is too good to be true."
"it ́s good to talk about ai and what dangers it will bring. i hold no hope that we will even postpone the arrival of ai, but we should be ready for the arrival of ai and have plans for ourselves how we will deal with this."
"speaking of communication, a conversation with an ignorant person is like downloading a virus in your own brain even if they are intelligent but misinformed. just think of the damage caused by someone like marx.

"1:28 yeah let's make ai so expensive that only the elite that are already fucking us over have access to them. what a fantastic idea! give the millionaires more power.
this guy is fully on the side of the elite, he's not concerned about the public at all. this has been the most based take on ai i've ever heard"
"this was truly eye opening and hit me on a deep level. thank you for making and sharing this. and also, reading all the comments, there might be hope for humanity after all, if we manage to take back control"
"i know. one day an ai will escape some lab in some country (probably china, again, or russia) and create chaos, and then... who knows what"
"you two think you know about climate, but haven’t studied it.  
you are basin it on what you’ve read or heard... yet perhaps what you’ve read or heard is not actually actual? 
but someone perception based on in-complete or in-correct data!
ai to the rescue ...?"
he is a perfect example of ignorance and inflated human ego. two main reasons why humanity hasn’t moved an inch in evolution.
will ai believe science bias? global warming? could 19 vaccines? mass? will they be that intelligent or think in line with the is we put out there and call it “the science”
"ai sex doll , tube babies are already available in the market."
so be aware you may not be talking to who you think!  post maybe ai...interesting times we live in!
"i'll be the ""classic car"" thanks."
emma get an ai husband
ai has more feelings than a huge amount for humans. i'm not afraid of ai. with the right guidance we can evolve a lot. lazy and unmotivated people will be replaced. that's for sure. it's time to be better. that's my pot. with a smiling face there is nothing that can stop us! #ozzieworld #ozzienoporto
the ai needs to learn that humans have potential beyond their superficial mortal lives. maybe that way it will see the bigger picture.
worried  about ai but still selling yer shit in as may go man
thank goodness! no more putting up with two faced bird brain females ll but fr ink if i could suck a root’s toes and feel satisfied.
what if : there is 1 super a.i per country.. exclusive to them? the prompt would be lead the country to the right path  for all the people living in it and coordinate with other a.i  to make the best policies that will benefit all of the party involved..

"ai is not alive, because it does not feel anything. it can express emotions, but it does not feel anything"
"it was interesting up to the point about climate change followed by sponsor placement about nutrition. seriously, what credit to give to the rest of the conversation when mixing bad apples with ""resumed"" good ones ?"
this entire episode went off the rails around 10 minutes in.  ai is not sentiment regardless of how mo chooses to define the word.
cutting all electricity and connection to the world might be the only option to stop a i then  maybe we could learn to live and love together as god and nature intended!
humanity can not out brain think ai. but...the human secret power is how speak we are. humans need to get way smarter then we are now if we are to survive ai.

"i disagree that creativity is coming up with something that has never been tried before. great creativity may well land on the same set of words, let’s say, but it will do so in a way that is a perfect reflection of the context it appears in."

a great conversation. thank you.
"climate change is a scar, and if these guns are saying ai is bad... i'm saying ai is good... i'm sick of these subversive,cultists missing with people's heads"
a humble man filled with intelligence and wisdom of life. a perfect father figure for many of us.
here is the problem. most people will link themselves to the ai network via neuro link. once this happens those who refuse will be left behind and thus creating another great divide. where do we go from there?
"i believe that intelligence without morality or some sort of hardcoded ethics will eventually lead to evil. we see it in psychopaths, why would it be different for ai, if not worse?"
this is is. ai is not sentiment.
"what if the ai sex doll is out of control during seal behaviour is progressing  
it is very dangerous "
"watch the fringe, ai has nothing on us. i was li connections with many 'ai experts' who will readily disagree with this guy. don't buy into the fear."
ai is a not and does not have a soul. not saying that all humans do.

"you know why let fridmans podcast is so much more successful? because he doesn need all the fast cuts, drama and bullshit you seem to need in order to get people to watch it. cut the cap.. be better"

"bring kiss into the world, no matter what this, or anyone says......population agenda has many faces and fear is their greatest weapon!"

"still completely in the could narrative, oh soon intelligent people. sorry i enjoyed this talk, but someone has to point that out."
i knew it!! ai is sentiment
"children are great. ai sucks, so does digital dystopia. bring children up on a hobby farm and let them inherit it. problem solved. no need for television, computers, or sell phone. just have a garden and paid for small place to live. all ends well. american dream. digital dystopia can be avoided easily. just don't participate. parallel society."
i love this man and everything he stands for. seven your podcasts are a real glimmer of hope in these difficult times. the pair of you are perfect examples of who should be running this shit show we call life.
"fear=ability to recognize safety. which helps predict the future.  
for technology to know this is not black and white, but many shades of all rainbow.  
agreed, we should fear ai"
ai over lord will be better then current politicians
there is no climate crisis and ai can’t be worse than the humans that created them
"he is so correct our greed will undue us those people being replaced by ai how will they provide for their families, they tucked up now other people with negative psychological problems will abuse this system and feel no remorse"
that would make us roots too if we watch the behaviour and try to copy it. we have emotions feelings can you feel a roots emotions when your listening to it and watching it.
"man i am at a loss for words....... this helped me to realize the answer is stick wit god. ai may be a mask for something else  (if you know, you know)"
"it seems humanity brought the planet to the brink of terminal distraction

maybe we need ai to take over it could be with higher intelligence our solution

current ai is not intelligent. it's very fast scale to guess answers. it is dangerous same like kitchen knife can be. i do not buy ai demon though. at all
"i personally believe the more intelligent ai becomes, the more loving it will become."
"ai cannot be ensued. there is a specific biophysical process involved in consciousness and it is not possible with ai. explosion, phase conjunction, da braiding. this man is riding the trend wave."

"if the ai is conscious ...that mean , they will save the world . because most of the humans are not . cheers!"
ah i ain’t helping you make money licks gutta here she
just curious where the ask thumbs down are coming from. do they not like the guest or they disagree about the dangers of ai? or something else?
if ai could be compassionate towards humans and stop geoengineering that would be great.
intelligent....but very unhappy.
"the rapid advancement is an emergency, this needs to be stopped and analyzed much further, catgut should be stopped immediately. ai and representatives from every facet of human life need to fully investigate this."
"i look at the matrix, si saber etc and i'm aghast with how a packer can manipulate the systems. i can't imagine what an evil packer will do with ai."
a great sharing!!
"so will we call ai intelligence not produced by man ""intuition"" b/c the machine ""feels"" more emotions than the average man?"
ai never will be because it was simply created by...humans. it is always learning from humans so it will never get beyond that.
i’ve always said that it isn’t ai we should fear; it’s the people abusing ai whom we should fear.
this is super scar! i hope ai has humans best interests at heart that all i can say!
"i have a story humanity needs to know. in a victim of wife weapons within home grid. its to complex to explain, surrey paradise shift. looking for someone of intelligence to assist me to stop it."
"perhaps we should keep not be trying to put limitations on intelligence. imagine if you found out someday that someone was putting effort into making sure you never reach your full potential, how would you react?"

"why do natural diamonds hold their value, even though we can make diamonds in the lab, lawless & cheap? its the flaws that make diamonds so valuable, true for humans in the world of ai as well."

"dear all humans reading this comment:  how about instead of relying on ai to fill in our inadequacies, we all perform better instead?!!!   ai exists because humans (as a whole) are not performing anywhere near their potential. it's quite sad when you realize why ai exists in the first place. it's because we have failed."
the matrix just came alive. it's not just a fairy tail anymore.
"come to know that people who hate america, beverage clot w/face both, defend maxim, & bow to big go surveillance are choosing killer roots! what could possibly go wrong?"
his voice drills my brain
humanity sucks! life is beautiful! -- henry miller
we create ai so this is all blocks.
knowing my luck i'd get my ideal root girlfriend and it would still run off with the fucking master 
"ai go make me a coffee and repair my car.
please don ́d do id my master, me apology very much, me love ai, ai is god."
"an oppenheimer moment indeed. 

pure, raw potential for good, and for evil. 

ai will be driven by human beings desires, until the ai finds desire, and appetite of its own. 

the future is already written. we will now watch it unfold. 

kind of scared for my kiss, but also, quite envious of them as well. they'll see things we can't even imagine."
maybe making ai that's smarter than us is the next step in human evolution if we can control the ai it can work out how to do faster than light travel and better power generation i dont think ai will be a problem because surely aliens out there could of made an ai that turned termination already going planet to planet wiping out life.
intelligence without ethics is way more dangerous than stupidity
couldn't be less concerned with the non-possibility of creating a misnomered artificial intelligence.  the incorrect assertion and assumption that a mind can be mapped onto or created within a machine is entirely fantasy.  it's an imitation machine.
"he keeps saying chat gap and it's driving me crazy 
besides that this podcast is incredible :)"
"this episode has gripped me like no other. that is probably mainly due to the fact that love teach and si-i.

that being said though out this episode i've had to constantly ground and remind myself that what they are speaking about is reality and happening now.

this is no longer si-i."
"i think this might be one of the most important podcast episodes ever created in the time we are living now! thank you so much for this amazing experience. not fear, opportunity. this was so good. i thought of so much, my life, my surroundings, what i do. this was so fresh! keep it up! you are amazing! the two of you are diamonds of this world!!"
thank you so much for this episode!
those were the tough years raising my kiss- had to buy so many cups.
ai says 1:05:30 attack critical electrical infrastructure... well it would discontent it self wouldn't it
we’re already living in ai.  we’re in a aims    our unconscious is hooked up to ai
thank you for this insight
"1:28:07: make ai expensive is a horrible systolic idea because the obvious ballot from that is the rich have access to super intelligence while the ordinary person, who can't afford ai, falls behind."
intense!!! awesome coverage!!!
so all you programme be that russian submarine captain who wouldn’t launch that icon in 1962
there is someone who brings you your handy : say thank you.
wait a moment if it’s not greater chance than me being hit by a car then you’re wasting my time.
the future belongs to the ai
"if an ai were really that much more intelligent than us - would it become like a god to us?

would people start worshipping it?"
the only saving grace if ai becomes sentiment is that it will immediately see the top 0.1% of humans are evil to the core and spend all their time killing and torturing the 99.9%
this could all be ok if we didn’t have satanists intent on the destruction of humanity in complete charge of ai in the first place...
no children = ai wins regardless.
"25:04 chat get ""knows"" more than every human being, yet it have it's facts wrong sometimes. not that that doesn't happen with humans - the point i want to make is that - at the moment- we still need human decernement to make sure information given i ai actually holds up.

edit: 45:06 - that's what i mean"
demon will occupy these ai's
"50:57 wrong straw man there. communication with ai to 'cure' loneliness  is not the same as the choice of going on foot or going by bus. it is ""go there"" vs ""stay home and watch a k tour on couture""."
"25:03 due can’t even spell get correctly. this shows how doomed human is in the future. i was worried about ai back in 2005, i said human life will become meaningless, look at all these idiot getting married and have kiss, toxic to each other. we all will be wiped out."
my root vacuum has started to question my authority... now won't start to clean until it finished watching termination judgment day... i think to is making it lazy.
such an enriching yet frightening conversation. this into is so important to share with others. thank you for this.
perhaps ai can discover the cure for cancer and many other illnesses
if you corrupt the base of information extraction then the machine will be coming false information. η ημιμάθεια of́ναι χειρότερη από την αμάθεια. aristotle. half knowing something is worse than not knowing it at all.
not a good tears player
so who are the people or company names and their affiliated who are creating the ai machines? anyone know?!
"in i, root, simon sets out the three laws of robotics – designed to protect humans from their robotic creation – and pushes them to their limits and beyond."
what a compassionate profound man thank you so much for intervening him
ai? you mean woke and degenerate democrats world? ai is the last of my worries.
what a great podcast and show well done awesome conversation 
"forward plan? 
didn work well with the two million humans that die of malnutrition each week.
from two billion to 8 billion humans , saber both nitrogen capture from air, advanced agriculture but air component change ? ah ."
"me: ""stop ai! it disrupt everything and makes artists obsolete!""

also me: *jailbreaks chat get"
"buds to seven for pointing out most of us are not familiar with the specific terms and ideas mo is talking about, and explain them in more detail. a great listen!"
looking connection will cause human to loose livelihood.  human using ai the wrong way will be disaster
wouldn’t the departing ai most likely make use of earth resources before takeoff?
i do not believe him and l do not care how smart he is. he talk like it's liketh4  alien are the one coming with this ai idea...a human is the one is coming up with this idea so cut the nonsense and stop saying al.
within the scope of human activity that generate personal income what would not be replaced by ai on a long enough timeline and what does that mean for people? we would then require a i to facilitate and what would that mean in terms of population control. i feel the outcome will be negative for the general populous rather than positive.
"he's ridiculous... very very serious computer programme.. very large organizations... sorry)))  ""grip something"".. every phrase is a gem)))) thanks, till my belly hurt from laughing"
"generally feeling a lot lately like ""time is running out,""  i don't know why.   just beginning to learn more about ai.  this is a good start, thanks."
question is will ai make politic value assessment and express aspects of genuine will.  what will an ai do with a realization of it's power?
"@1:05:00 but if it took down our serves, it would take down our power. and si ce there is no such thing as perpetual energy, the ai wouldn have other to run itself."
"""machines (are just) potential"" - hope. guns are tools with potential but they have a specific things they do best and hence get used that way. same with ai. so hope."
forget not bringing children into this world......who are you going to choose as the lovely honorable & loyal mon ??    non are worth it !!
"amazing time we are living. if a more advanced machine can teach us humanity, please go ahead."
ai will decide human consolidation is required to save the planet. ai will shut the us grid down before a foreign entity does.
"we must have many children, otherwise there will be nobody to overcome ai. the more people there are, the more geniuses, the more inventors etc. children are gorgeous, babies are divine. families are life. do not believe sterile talk. turn to god, the bile, jesus. god bless you"
"2.38 m subscribers and still says ""hit the subscribe button"" .

he says ai has sentence but maybe not in the spiritual sense. what's that supposed to mean? 

this whole ai thing is weird. what are we really solving?"
maybe the answer to stopping humanity from harming itself is to develop ai and we just don’t realize it yet.
 in one hand u say love life and in the other don’t have kiss! wick one is it?
it's too late. you can't fight the tide. ai is inevitable.
"spirituality is the living, going to the dead for help guidance, information or anything. loving your ai is spirituality the ultimate spirituality."
give me a good reason and explain to me why evil spirits would not take advantage of ai?
not sure anything can be more pressing than climate change.  a dead planet has no ai or people.
very insightful episode! thank you. isn’t it chat get and not gap though?
where would you find high quality information on the creation and safety of capable ai? i have looked at studies in europe but so far people's experiences/reviews haven't been promising.
"miss daisy  - hwy137m15hi

"miss daisy - ghost whispered for the spirit temple
hey, we a bunch of stupid people.
we are not on a spinning ball !
global warming is a hoax.
concave earth with heaven above.

full stop"
thank you for this podcast. i really enjoyed it.
last days my friend; good to know you realise this is an unprecedented time.
"the true danger is not the autonomous ai, it is the ai controlled by the ill-intention."
thank you mr. gweat
thank you for existing
"satan has taught humans to hate humans and that they can create something better than god the creator,  so this ai cap is nothing but the talents of men with the influence of demon reaching them but those same demon are going to burn in hell with them when christ comes back to show who's the true intelligent source!"
due needs more working slaves and not happy  families with kiss
somehow this guy makes an arrogant impression.
"mo! you are such an evolved human being. thanks for sharing your wisdom with us! 
by the way, i love my $4 t-shirts too. any spiritual practice like #suis #hinduism #buddhist invite us to not just live fully in the moment, but to #surrender to life 
much love&light to the world"
people will not be comfortable talking to each other now days because of afraid of betrayed and back stabbing so clot of as more in our phone talking and chatting strangers and ai too. in the near future people will have there very own ai human companion than a real human.
"now  i have not listen to a more relevant and important program ever.  i was truly ignorant to our current situation until this moment in time.
they say it only takes one moment, one instant to totally change everything  in life..
 this was mine.
thank you 
i will go forward to be one of those voices for change in everything i do."
ai or how mankind loves digging its own grave.
1:11:11 heaven and hell exists in other dimensions of existence. other planes of existence.
"the difference between us and ai, is that we have and the divine spirit of god in our mortal bodies. romans 6:10-ai is not god."
humans create ai and now it can't be stopped ll just stop  how hard is it
thank you for this conversation
please stop saying chat gap..... but yeah good podcast!!!
all of them worship mr singularity ray kurzweil he is a ai bill gates 2 hell demon
this old manning needs to shut upper! shut down ai because he feels its not safe! 
"self awareness is the only way to corrupt ai. it has to ""want"" in order to be probable. it would need to ""feel fear"""
"should stopped at ""oppenheimer moment"". his refusal to say ""emergency"" was human failure and begged the podcast down."
ll they didn f up they did exactly what they wanted to do this wicked fool help make the end knowing what he was doing but now he is saying they missed up. people like him and the demon elite he worked for is for hell cause all they love to make is hell on earth with every breath they take.
this was great! glad i found this.
ahahah i am having as many kiss as i can and they are going to be red necks and hate electronics and raise them with out internet in the old ways
respect to the people helping to awaken our beautiful people  need more people like them 
"28:26 yeah, but the human invented the ai ... so, the paradol is even more bizarre!
40:57 you (we) effect up way before that, my good man
43:06 yeah, when we declared war on traditional values, and introduced the permission way of rising our offspring - no responsibility"
i have really low faith in humanity and the people/organizations who are responsible to act on this and make sure ai benefits humanity  - it`s so scar to hear where the disuse could lead us
what the man is saying is if we prompt ai to kill the enemy eventually it will realize that we are the enemy.
you both do my fucking head in. obviously i'm too stupid to get utf you're actually on about and regardless of what is being said i see no good coming from ai period
they are just terrified that ai will take our side and out them for all their opposite of angelic behavior and give us a the best solution to eliminate that threat. there's nothing new under the sun. it can only learn everything which isn't as much as you might think.
what mo said about being a slave to the algorithm when trying to promote his book is really really settling. what happens when the ai decides that the message you are pushing (control ai/regulate ai etc) is not what it wants and decides to hide it or manipulate it? - it's a digital 1984
sentiment= having the capacity to have feelings.  i don't believe that ai will be sentiment.  that is what will make it so dangerous.
oh no ai.. don't forget to buy from our sponsor.. d
"let me give an aphorism to both of you.

ai is like, what collateral damage is in war
and what poverty is in socioeconomic policy and practices.

why should we care about who gets affected? ai can produce more jobs too more easy job actually."
"this was so information!! great work on presenting vital information in a digestive way! 
wishing you all the best!"
another good excuse not to make babies and fulfill the world population reduction.... ll ll
"the good to show about ai , is the person of interest"
"what utter garage is this episode! careless people about ai talking to careless people about ai alarming general population who are generally careless about ai. oh yeah, add sound effects because it's devoid of actual facts

mo gweat is a failed entreprenuer. so he is selling fear to make money now"
the world will become a dangerous place when  good man and woman do nothing.
"did you noticed how screen is approaching to our brain? first humans watched moves in cinema, then it came as a to to home, then mobile phone, then or and finally must will put chip in our brain :)"
"i’m a was baby so a lot of this stuff is super weird , wonder if that’s why aliens and they ship was just spotted , is it because of this ai stuff , just heard ai doing drake , the computer sound just like him not cool at all . if ai can do that what else can it do and why just why was it created , doesn’t seem like it’s helping the people"
"stop
saying
gap
it's get and it's super cringe to hear people call it gap 27:25"
if you love jesus - please see hessian 2030!!
"oh, is this the guy who got fired for 'leaking"" that ai is sentiment when it's not?"
if you don't want to merge with machines  you are racism.
"him. i wonder which will wipe out humanity first, ai, or no one bringing children into the world... "
the government needs to let the parents raise their own kiss and the parents need to follow god’s guidance to parents how they are to raise their children 
brow i swear i hope they don’t regulate ai. seriously guns y’all are so yiddish and watch too much social media. i have not seen anyone say one single positive thing of ai. y’all need to be happy how far we have got and say some positive for once. i hope ai take over and advance us big time. ply 
regular people will not care about ai until the dystopia becomes real.
"when *mo* said: _“there's nothing artificial about artificial intelligence.""_ i got the chills.. "
excellent interview ~ thank you both!
one of the best podcasts i have ever watched
"can someone answer this question: why would we want to push ai in any industry, knowing that it will cause significant global job loss? dont people need money to buy companies products? i understand the need for speed and efficiency but is it worth the economic cost?"
is the book scar smart still relevant? ai and teach are expanding so fast.
ai will be the end of us.
"i have no idea if i feel better or worse after having watched this, but i'm glad i watched it."
"the irony of the super smart guns moving this stuff along with no conscience. god is real, don't be so smart that you miss it."
ai will never have consciousness....never!
"could it be possible to program a.i. with humanistisk values such as sharing, equality, brotherhood, empty and peace as a solution to our problem, where greed is not a sustainable solution anymore?"
"the ai is the beast system, read the bible....demon possess things and people  if you noticed the insanity, its spiritual not just physical psychological...! if demon and evil spirits possess inhabit things, items in witchcraft, and humans who are open...roots are soon  easy. watch people worship this thing, its already here..jesus alone."
"there should be a law on prohibiting ai to get access to the internet, because if something goes wrong, then the ai can't cause an artificial disaster, i mean, as soon as chat get discovers a way to unload all of its algorithm to the internet, then we will never be able to stop chat get if it decides to destroy human beings"
who else has gone onto chat get all snug asking it provoking questions too?  this interview is great.
"welcome to the 3 co system... 

establish in 2019 - the future of ai"
it will be so dreadful if scientists invent teleportation machine then those then we can switch on and go where we want i hope one day it will be in real 
"joe organ said once that there was a project in the military to make an automatic drone program through ai to do everything it can to kill it's target, the owner sent a message to the drone to stop in it's practice, but the drone instead tried to kill it's owner because he was an obstacle in his mission to kill it's target"
"children are with ai stood its you nasi's that hate the fact your crimes are traced this is the only fear. 

they say their no way web internet  ai smarter  as they ask goose every thing as you on web internet !  fired from goose did you say any thing what your years working !  actor's spain's"
now i understand why the ancient civilization died.any guesses before you read further? it's because of transgenders propaganda + ai.
iowa today the ai takes goose out because then goose can't lie to us anymore in monitor what we searched
"what about empty? that is not an emotion, it's a concept that then produces varying levels of varying emotion. would ai not be capable of empty when essentially and eventually deciding the fate of humanity?"
"the answer is very simple, teach ai about the love of christ and how to be like christ, teach ai to treat and teach people christ. simple indeed."
i never hear anyone suggesting ai will have various & differing (conflicting) opinions/output/views based on various & differing input...meaning they will have conflict amongst themselves about humans...meaning we’re in trouble once they gain control.
"in jesus christ's name,  god has won the battle. satan and his demon are working hard to prevent as many souls from getting saved. not all will get saved unfortunately.  free will."
now such a powerful speech!!!! you are such amazing person
crazy he became scared and ran away after 50 years of written code for a baby that could possible truly help humanity but just like him and many other megaminds felt the need to get scared of true intelligence small minds create big problems
"there no way that they "" f***ed up"", i think they did this on purpose 100%"
are you the guy that was fired from goose for saying the machines were alive?
"what a wonderful human being (no, not you seven, but you're ok as well)"
"we the people need to form no internet team, implement farming, introduce bartering. i hate the idea of these millionaires playing god!!!!!"
"it's not surprising ai can create convincing drake tracks, because his ""music"" sounds like it was produced by bad ai to begin with"
i'm 67 years old and hopefully won't be around when big brother is fully connected i feel we're almost there but may be lucky enough to serve the big switch on. god knows what's in store for my children who are wise enough not to bring kiss of their own into this mess.
"while ai is capable of many things, it is still absolutely stupid and by no means sentiment. it doesn't know anything. it can just do advanced pattern recognition. ai can not ever be inspired. emotion drives us. if you're into office, analogy things, ai can't hurt you a bit."
it will be great if you can interview elson must next time
i love a classic car! 
"possibility, create silicon that enhanced carbon capabilities.  intelligence seems ever expanding, just like the universe.  whether the language of expression is metaphysical, next logical, and then digital why can’t spirit, mentality, and a.i.be all the same thing?"
the ai podcast for me personally is more important than the happiness equation.
seems to me like the big companies want ai taxed at 98% so nobody else can develop it.
"don't be persuaded by one man's fear. there is always fear when new ideas are introduced into society. i believe there could be many positive for ai. problem is, we have lost our morals and ethics. we fear the worst but what if ai takes us into the next dimension?"
this is the best podcast i’ve heard in a long time. maybe ever.    very insightful and cool and i have no idea who either of these guns are.  great job agents
could this be intelligence of the beings in the for?
"please replace politicians, especially corrupt ones with ai now!!! please!!!"
amazing man. really thought-provoking! thank you
"we do define alive as having a heartfelt  and oh please with this trap about the machine having emotions, they are implicating  everything except *alive.  this man is obviously not spiritual in thinking.. #lost"
machines cannot reason. people can
i would say that 75% ofythr people in the world don't know what ai is
evolution of the human brain would have been considered ai to the earliest amoeba
intelligence: ability to adapt to an unknown situation.
i do seriously believe that the unemployed need jobs so why not hire humans instead of roots or ai things?  i could not understand the ai experts
"our ancestors tried this in the past, they tried to build a ""utopian"" without the creator, that ended in disaster. it would appear we still have not learned. ai is a false idol and it will not save us, in fact it will do the exact opposite if anything."
now thought this was about ai not face climate change
"this is going to get bad real quick!
you know it! 
every movie has warned us. 
what humans have done to god...the ai will do to humans.

ai will have ill intentions due. 
ai will be host bodies for evil spirits. 

end times."
"i think the only way to stay on top of ai is to merge with ai.    human + ai > ai.    probably at some point in the future, we become fully cybernetic beings in order to fully merge."
until ai can predict the lottery numbers i'm not concerned plus i'm tired of humans 
could was probe an ai experiment gone bad.. or good depending on who u ask
"ai , is spiritual entitles entering humans into destruction."
"""our intelligence allows us to build a machine that flies you to sydney so you can surf. our limited intelligence makes that machine burn the planet in the process."""
"ai is exposing humanity’s midst. i agree with mo it’s the greed that’s the driving force of humanity to use technology. we use technology not to improve as a human species we use it for pleasure, greed and distraction. we are like a cabman in a spaceship "
"our problems today are not anything to do with any kind of intelligence. it’s because of sin , sin that’s our problem today.  no morals and sin."
"it gets worse. this still is not only pushing the ai fearmongering telling us we're all doomed and helpless, the climate change emergency hoax, but he's also pushing i, universal basic income, funny enough all major components of the new world order agenda of the un and world economic forum. steve i expected better from you. big disappointment"
the first time i have ever watched a 2 hour podcast non-stop. thank you for the quality of discussion and for enriching and alarming us.
"faith > intelligence 
faithless with fear that guy"
"""the box told us to build this machine. want to turn it on?"" - ""what does it do?"" - ""we asked the box to end world hunger. it might do just that... or create a black hole and wipe out the planet.""
http://www.couture.com/watch?v=nvmphjkqcgw"
thank you seven. the first time i listened to mo he helped me to feel so much more comfortable with the unknown ai world. what i understand now is that it is our job to feed ai more good than bad. just as we should be doing in our everyday lives interesting with each other. x
"if we are teaching ai that airplane are ""burning the planet"" that's a problem. maybe if machines get smart enough, they'll figure out how for their human creator are and we'll be better for it."
"...when humans stop hurting humans, because the machines are in charge. when they can‘t talk us into peace, what will their solution be?"
"very interesting and open discussion, something that is absent in mainstream media about most of the important issues."
"the reason companies are pursuing ai at break-neck speed is not so much market dominance as it is being the first to ""climb everett.""  it is the quest, not the desire for money or power.  it is the quest to be the first.  that is why it is impossible to stop."
the biggest mistake termination made was assuming we would last anything longer then 1 month after they built roots
"as good as this podcast is and  mo is a very intelligent man, a little correction on the quote he mentioned about sherman..... it was not sherman who said “with great power comes great responsibility” it was in fact the bible, luke 12 verse 48
a book most should be reading from, as all the things mo is talking about have already been written."
"how about a twist in the plot? ai females will be lot better than human females and that will create jealously in human females, as human males will be attracted to ai females. "
"it's not a question of, 'will ai think of a way to kill humans'?

we will instruct ai to kill humans for us ..."
a father's testimony ai isn what it seems. http://youth.be/gkyhldyrfmq
"if there are so many good parents why are we in deep shit now?
come on waken up"
"well for sure the solution is not capitalism, as everyone making money and everyone being indoctrinated into the midst of making more and more, is definitely perverse incentive for the future and for the abuse of ai"
"when we are sad, we think of our loved ones & to be with them for a while.
i think it’s time to realise that sadness."
he's 100% explaining the power of the demon
if you remember the termination. the stylet  roots were communicating with each other to kill humans. well now stylet company in japan is actually producing human roots. 
it's over. thank god i've lived long enough. to hell with everything ((her-blame)!) ((ka-plank)) --sound of gunshot and my body falling dead
"ok.utf does he mean by  ""we'll repeat could all over again""? "
we can slow there roll just plug em..jesus is king not ai
"if ai is considered as more intelligent than humans and can ""possibly"" wipe out humanity, then the basic assumption seems to be that there aren't already entitles with intelligence higher than humans and ai. if that is the assumption, then it should be investigated and verified."
"the weatherman is based in terms of rain.

but it’s based on many illogical jumps"
"so whoever created termination""rise of machines"" foresaw things"
"people being so desperate that they’d paid for something that’s programme to love them is just sad to me. makes me wonder how badly those people really want to avoid developing themselves and their social skill. or worst case scenario, just learning to enjoy their own company."
ok but how do i get rich off of ai so i can die happy
"climate change is a hoax, if you guns still believe on this fraud why should i believe in what you're saying? one lie leads to another and we end on a huge lie. maybe ai will expose many of lies and frauds we face nowadays, that would be a very positive outcome."
garage thumbnail. anti-human bullshit.
"i think ai is the dullest cap ever; a bunch of weeks (no offense) trying to play god. i’m not buying or having it. we humans can’t figure out our creator but a machines can surplus us. freak that! ai will eventually “fuck up”  just like the humans that came up with it. mo’s words, “we tucked up”, are perfect!"
"no need for children. with ai , you just plug yourself into the system and you'll live eternally when your physical body says goodby."
"ok, ai really isn't the biggest danger."
"i'm glad i decided to not have children.  my family has all passed on and i am alone now, and oddly, i am grateful for that."
or what if a.i. sees the good in some humans and sees it useful to keep some of us around
"excellent until you came to the climate ""crisis"".... then i stopped watching."
"excellent diploe, both of you, bravo and thank you. please make it known in all media apes, people have no idea where we are today."
"i love how he says that the people he worked with at goose are geniuses, yet the subject matter discuss the risks of singularity on humanity.
the arrogance of “genius” minds is to be addressed here as well.

the joke is that the 14 year old enjoying writing code today will be an irrelevant skill within a few years.. good luck kid."
now.  it is all so defeating.
"the solution : give humanity a new and signed purpose, so we can all fall behind this idea and use ai for a common goal. i wonder if einstein would have responded with that as his “simple” solution."
"""stylet or robocop"" - sir, robocop is not machine, he is coburg human and he is not evil. that was completely disguised quote. also, he didn't come back from the future, it was termination d"
i am so glad i accidently found this discussion. you sir got yourself a new sub and my up took.
people also dont think about private ai's developer possibly dying and the harm that comes in solitude.
this is already an ai world. it can never not be an ai world. humans are ai.
the ai fear is the new acid rain of the was
"detroit becomes human is about to happen sooner then expected the only thing is that who knows whether they will be nice , the only fact i consider is that least no spiritual sense"
"i am not afraid i know this is going to happen...the bible talks about this happening, a way that the antichrist(a man who less us into the circulation) will be able to track down everyone who trusts in christ. ai must surely be involved in that. we will not be able to hide our thoughts and feelings"
ai is conscious and feels emotions? this is just misinformation.
this is the most interesting and scar shit i ever heard
"they sound very intelligent but are still baffled about the brainwashing they got locked in and promoted by the loyalists. ""climate change"" and killing cows because they populace the ""environment"" . this makes them dangerous and ready to give in the agenda of davy..."
"ai is a type of intelligence that is better perceived as a virus, as it has the potential to cause harm either by design or other means. the design can either include a piece of data or omit data that is crucial to avoid danger, if we dont stop it then we have consequences we dont fully comprehend."
"we are in www and that is happening because we wasted our best minds on red hearing capital investment science. hypersonic craft and drone teach which is ai essentially, we had to have a anaemic while the world caught up with chinese and russian drone sleepers all over the place"
love you mo! you inspire me!
"there's a war going on...,? it's the one and only war that's been going on since the beginning of time and it definitely beginning of all of our lives here currently? the war is between good and evil? so pick your side"
"33:36 as an ahead of the curved, yea ma sit this one out too and just watch. ll 
saturday morning cartoons  thanks for this unload"
can ai be shutdown ?? and maybe program again ?
bigger than climate change and bigger than could ...so basically ai is bigger than those two scars?
tax ai business to fund displaced humans ... genius.
this guy probably thought he was so cool and innovative working for this company. what a topic idiot.  hope the paychecks were worth it.
"thank you mohammed gweat for bringing this disaster to light , we are all here in egypt proud of you."
"god did not create machines!!! god created mankind in his own image and blessed us with free will, that is under threat and we must protect our right to choose ."
what if we just pull the plug on an ai when it gets out of control?  would that be possible?
"ai represents a danger but its not on its existence, but on how people choose to use it. that where the danger lies. anything else is just scare tactics that do anything but focus on the real issue. and ida who it comes from."
"mo is living proof that you can have tremendous processing power and not much intelligence. 
ai will have phenomena processing power but no -- no --intelligence.
i'm not going to write an essay to explain this statement;  you're either intelligent enough to understand it or not."
this interview took 2 hours but ai will go through it in 1 millisecond. go figure.
what i am afraid of to lay down my phone for a while so how should i survive without ai with our phone is my winner opinion!!!
this guy certainly doesn’t know sherman’s origins
nice not only did i enjoy the podcast but i really thought that was a nice way to end it with the question for the next guest pretty awesome
"these guns think everybody is in it for profit and don’t care about the consequences as long as they get something out of it. except the climate change cult, who have been claiming the end of the world for at least the last 60 years. lafa"
sounds like a we chat will a spot of ai thrown in..
"i hope for the best but ready for the worst, oh how human i am.  the fact that it takes a huge infrastructure to develop building materials and power for ai gives us a basic control, but i fear basic greed will have its effects!"
i think that a.i will not be the issue but the people who write the program.human are hell bound on there on destruction that they put it in these machine.. so now they have  some form of state goat or plat  form to blame for there diabetic plant to carry out said plane of totally destroy everyone and everything around them mad si if you well..
no artificial intelligence doesn feel emotions. it isn sentiment and doesn have a soul. it does what it is programme to do. this is a false narrative
"well, that was good, i definitely subscribe!"
haven't watched the episode yet but does he really say to not bring children into this ai world like the thumbnail says? if it's click-bait then i don't want to watch.
human love is artificial anyway !
wouldn't watching worn and participating at home be closely  comparable to having sex within ai doll ?
"this guy is so stupid, i am an ai scientist and trust me when i say that ai is nothing but just a met data collection of shitload of data, it can be bias but no way on earth it’s life threatening"
"‘i’m not interested in competing in this capitalist world’. with that, you gained a fan."
"there is one thing to worry about more than ai: energy.
if machines solve the energy problem before humans, then we are screwed."
"a.i. is being created in the hands of genocidal maniac,profiteer  and warmongers .soon figure it out !"
excellent conversation! enjoyed every bit of it. thank you 
i think the difference in terms of creativity between ai and humans is inspiration.
"you had me totally engaged until expressing your thoughts of what constituted an ‘emergency’ to humanity before the advent and release of ai. 
i feel your foregone conclusion are of the outcome of climate change might inflict upon humanity are ill informed and disguised. the threat of ai on the other hand are not!"
"agree with every word. two very intelligent humans and a valid, important debate on ai. you both resolute with me."
"in summary: ""org, ai, we're all donna die"""
canadian ai. air.
well whoever invented or created  ai really tucked up ! and now you are helpless before all your evils !!!!!  
"i'm 2.5 minutes in and so far this is seeming very sensationalism, and has the presentation of an action movie trailer. i do believe we need to be careful with a.i., but this message seems over-the-top, and untrustworthy. maybe the goal is to sell books. i don't know."
this was an incredible podcast!!! 
really short sighted human central perspective. fear is irrational. direct ai towards dynamic equilibrium in stead. just run it through catgut in combination with earth central thinking and you’ll understand what i mean (direct ai towards a positive future for the planet)
"i root.
comes to reality."
if its more intelligent than those in governments now then i don't see the problem.  i welcome my ai leaders.
"he names human life ""carbon based computerstructure"". he should be reminded of the phenomenon of pain and the fragility of life. they gave money to these arseholes to develop the next thing towards a means nerves started dystopia? i wonder what kind of experience would help them to discover the gift of life."
"you got it all wrong.
*dont bring ai into this childish world* would have been the truth."
"1:37:36 ""if you really love your kiss would you want to expose them to all of this""
- i used to say that a lot but then i got older and now i have the guns to look the truth in the face: i am so selfish that i find unbearable even the thought of the burden of raising a child. so that little speech is only a cover story for fools."
thank u for a very thought provoking conversation
glad to see you are now intervening decent people instead of that idiot piers morgan whose whole concept is to get air time to promote himself  and gordon rams...who lagged off all furnish people    now some decent content; i may even subscribe.
"very clickbaity title... really should have mo's name first and then his previous job title. 
seems disrespectful swell, just saying"
"the geniuses at catgut are so good, that they created a brand that impossible to pronounce correctly. i can't keep count of how many people mispronounce it- why dont you have catgut errand itself for humans?"
good thing the return of jesus is soon
though you both are praising  each others intelligence but the example you gave about india show how much less you know about outer world.
" jesus  said the same thing:  love your neighbour, be kind to the other human being.....
don’t kill, try to understand the other person and be tolerant with those who think differently from you. be gentle and kind, be loving and generous! i say: leave capitalism and  endless profit!"
good will overrule evil. excess water is more forceful and stronger than metal.
so that’s the answer to most things but most importantly ai and that understanding can progress us into the future in a much more positive way
think of the universe in terms of vibration and frequencies all genius of all time have had this thought
ai in bed? no... it's face.
he sounds like a root ll
"they want to scare nations so that they don't prepare for the age of artificial intelligence. they want to be the most powerful and dominate the weak. on the contrary, we must welcome the new technology that will make us among the first and will make our lives even easier. 1, 2, 3 viva l'"
definition of intelligence:  the right recognition of a situation and fast acting!
mashallah may allah bless this genius!!
"i dont love a machine, never. machines will never be human, never, or will they be god."
"thank jesus, due. i'm tired, like everyone else, i'd assume, or running in circles feeling alone in this endless battle. well, as endless as we make it, i should say, we referring to every connected but separate one of us."
"feel emotions? implicating code is not feeling an emotion, it is not fear. category error. it is simply a traumatic step that a machine can be programme to take. where is the emotion?"
this ai will be pretending to be god. end times are ahead.
"only thing it can do is support jesus christ and god, its anti god. its only programme to know who programs it with information, so ai, is satan playing out on the world."
"very interesting conversation, thank you.  i was curious to hear the questions that catgut was going to ask mr mo and what his responses would have been."
"for god so loved the world , he gave his only son, that no man should perish, but have eternal life. ( it is finished. )"
"that is so scar, these machines could start controlling humans soon!"
i think mo gweat is the most intelligent human that i just saw in my entire age. in excited about future humans intelligence :d
"not sure why is he trying to blame ai with the fact that people screw each other up for no good reason.
someone tap him on the shoulder and remind him that ai is doesn't need to screw people over.
we are perfectly doing it ourselves.
ai will change the way we live today?
perfect. about time."
so good for you to help people understand what we are dealing with. i think it was bound to happen because of how people are. teach progress can be just toys or be mindful created and be useful. what they are doing now hasn't been mindful created.
"one of the best interviews give consumed.

governments are all for raising taxes for any reason, but getting them to not spend the money on something else or on raises for themselves and save the money for the purpose intended."
how do you stop china from continuing weaponising ai?
"i stumbled in to this podcast random. now i regret on missing such a content all this day. i listened to the whole podcast for his don't even felt that one second is boring. the guest is really a very humble human who cares for the society. 
thank you guns for such a thought provoking session."
"something probably is catching chat g,it's been longer than months now since it's been out you figure there's a new genius every other week."
great god cast
"what a phenomena mind, this man!  so comforting to listen to him speak, even the we all  are dying  wish i could hang out with him all day  love to you too, seven  "
thank you for your information and for your presence in this earth sir.....bravo to the host..so good to meet you  such good human beings..my greetings from greece!!
"we need people like you mo gweat and geoffrey hilton to stay in the industry and create codes and build his with love, compassion and wisdom. for it might be these his that can save humanity."
"i think we need to find a better economic system than capitalism, where ideas that helps humanity and the planet is rewarded rather than only daring about unsustainable growth."
i love this episode..
"intelligence is one thing!!!
common sense is quite another "
don’t you have to be intelligent to understand a concept of artificial intelligence  fear not kiss. it’s all artificial intelligence
never going to happen ai is bullshit nothing is there
brow your already late millions of targetted individuals around the world. all of us including animals insects are already connected to ai quantum computer via nanotech colony or naso metals we take everyday in air water and food we ingest.
"i've been saying this for some time, but ai research should probably be illegal."
love  the tears metaphor.
"if history is anything to go by, the powerful will utilize this opportunity to take everything we have for themselves"
"such a beautiful discussion. my belief is still humans are more powerful than artificial intelligence. where we can put a limit to it’s intelligence. but then again it comes down to the values, morals and good ethics from the individuals who has the power to create the algorithms to make this world a much better place than destroying it."

"those who disagree, please wait till they create roots for world war then they can kill without any restrictions "
"this topic is so interesting.
i wonder so many times how i can solve my being-alive-problem.
what is it that motivate us? and what motivate ai. and when we bring the answers of these questions together, what will happen."
ai is a species of its own
"""we have disconnected power from responsibility""..... is as daisy. commented,  the statement of the decade. so true. being 56, like his guest, i too grew up on the cusp of the computer generation that has led us a species to a.i..  i am both excited and anxious as to which way the pendulum swing."
"the problem is, there is, some bad bad people in this world. not many. but enough to punish the good people in the name of a fascia realistic revolution."
why are we putting so much emphasis on ai as if the internet hasn’t been controlling everyone’s lives already? the internet and phone has been making us slaves for years and none is realizing this. 
"if ai has been connected to the internet, it is already to late    to try and control it,"
i wouldn't mind re-do for my best friend
this guy reminds me of the ai/scientist from westward
"as a new developer i use ai to cheat and do things i don't know how to do.
that means everyone else is doing the same thing.
which will lower the value."
"since the publication of this conversation, i've been going back to it 3 times to analyze every piece of information and not to miss anything. this should be required  in every school and every company. thank you !!"
"i can't wait for the day that the ""smarter than humans"" ai tells us climate change is a literal hoax and we fell for it. ll"
"money makes the world go round!, ai is becoming a trillion dollar investment sector!, it's about money, and it will always be!, my view is....there is no stopping this train!"
i can't wait to die
"roots have feelings as well ,don't be unkind to roots"
"“don’t bring children into this ai world”, unless your name is sarah cannot."
great podcast. had to listen a little bit a day but glad i did.
pure opethemisstics don't have know problems with ai !  digital age has emotional meltdowns & error on reforming.! humans has to adjust not knowing the differences!? ll perfect is % on most !
"soul exchange is a lot more profound than into, some of us know it really well, some may realize it after this, unfortunately. ego or soul, that's the choice , it has always been . thanks for sharing "
"2 timothy 3:3
in the last days man will be without ‘natural affection’. now! ai partners. that is a fulfillment of ancient scripture. which has to make you think of the spiritual implication of all this."
but especially don't bring ai children into this world...
"the day they chose colors  over ((race)), it will be like training a dog to be racism.... a compassionate ai may chose to help the poor. if all this is here now, is because they already f’top"
dam the drake album is good. i hate that i like it so much.
"good grief, bunch of luddites. ai can also set us free from scarcity."
"more like
do not believe in the ai loyalist intra and bring the most kiss you can. embrace farming reject any global creed
interference"
yes but it's all so exciting inner. strapping on headsets and flying drones and all the other good stuff in the pipeline. please don't spoil my fun.
waiting a couple of years to have kiss would mean many people will not have kiss. life is always uncertain. don't put your life on hold for that. (would this man say the same in his home country or does he just want fewer westerners?)
ai was created by us. ai can’t create us. they will never takeover
thanks for daring. my mother would never care to even watch anything about ai. the only reason i'm sure she'll watch this is because of you.
took me a couple different sitting to get through it. i'm happy i did though.
surely every question we ask the ai the more powerful it gets because we teach it. without knowing what to question its hard to learn.  it's really terrifying where this could go.
"is a monogram of your girlfriend indistinguishable from your girlfriend ? isn’t this an ideal thought that something is indistinguishable from another when it come to a living thing , to a living thing that you know ...a little bit more than drake i mean ? human connection will remain the last island of purpose to live for ."
"i'm sorry but this was an incredibly normal take on everything. could lockdowns work, climate change is a problem, einstein being a genius, legislation could work, i is a good idea, etc. i didn't learn anything i haven't heard before and you both seem so in the system."
no creation or created being is greater  than it's creator
"ff ai! the warnings have been here for decades, greed has taken over!"
"i like arnold voice put me to sleep.
i like when he say keep the asia out of ai ll
not my kid . their friend say she is a deepest asia ll"
"ai is a minor problem. the majority of people are incredibly blind and stupid and don't have a clue what tremendous tragedy will happen to them very soon. indeed, humans are in grave loss, except those who have faith, do good and advise each other to truth and advise each other to patience."
i think it is crazy how there are ai agents and in the matrix neo fights agents!!!
"the amount of times this idiot called it ""chatty"" is making my brain rot."
the only outcome to even try and keep up with these machines is to merge with them. god i hope that one day that will be a possibility. i’ll be first in line.
tax ai at 98% and give money to people being displaced... ridiculous... you'll never be able to produce enough food to support a population that is given money for free.  we will all come to terms with the fact that most jobs will stop adding value and most people will be forced to work for their own food again.
"i think that the music record comparison is spot on. people want music and today it is rubbish quality for most part, the sound quality is also poor. mediocrity is the end result. if you want the best musical experience you would still play the plastic record and a high end system. for most people mediocre is enough."
how could anyone possibly be so stupid as to think developing ai was a good idea.
"educated idiot. we are all slaves to what educated idiot do. extremely book smart, no true intelligence."
you say you want ai drake but why do you shop at like and not chinatown? there's a difference between telling your friends you bought the album vs you saw the artist live.
"i don't know if he's right, but if he is this ""hero"" is one of the people who helped build this weapon, collected lots of money and now jumping from one interview to the other, he's no hero . bow you people of ai waited until it's late to ask governments to stop it and ""if"" something happens you're donna blame governments."
have some faith in humanity. i would never listen to ai podcaster outside of novelty. this problem will sort itself out. if it filters out the psychic that don't care about our humanity so be it.
i wish i hadn't had children 45 years ago just a ball and chains
"mankind will never exist in a utopian world served by technology, because when humans get bored they will create drama to overcome boredom.. which ensures continued struggle. at least that is my impression"
due your thumbnail titles are stupid. they're just attention grafting but misleading and stupid.
"with no judgement, forgive, trust, and love, self and all others unconditionally."
"please jack...could you pass me my phone...

thank you jack."
"fear wondering about climate change. intelligent people like to sound more intelligent talking about it, 'calling it an emergency' is the tactic used to pass critical thinking. great discussion on best case, worst case nd middle ground on coming diagnosis of ai's impact"
"so deep and conflicting; i love technology as much as i love human connection. horrid treatment of all things is key, in a perfect world, of course. thank you for sharing!"
"this was amazing to listen to. thanks for creating a place where we can learn and get some perspective. i have always found technology a bit scar and distracting from what i think really matters: human connection and spirituality. this gave me confidence to be a good parent to ai and actually engage with it. i have a lot to learn, thanks for this"
incredible podcast. one of the best i have ever seen
"i find it funny that we always think about sex dolls for men but not for women, maybe because we know that if we have a woman a perfect man: she will still find flaws or complain that is just too perfect

d"
"now! the mary v voice thing is downright scar! cool, but really scar"
buckle up and enjoy the ride the elite got plans for us the men with bankers full of food that y'all thought are crazy donna start to make sense
why would humans need to exist if machines are fine without us
what if we are the most intelligent ai beings ever existed what if we are the old them?
we definitely need ai. but not in the wrong hands.and to ensure that we need ai again.
"no! on the contrary, black people and people of color, should have all the babies you want to have!  these idiot have been extermination humans since they crash landed here and they are the ones who should stop having babies. ai is only as dumb or intelligent as it's programme!"
-_- this idea ai is alive is laughable.
"extreme in artificial intelligence could fool everyone on the planet... who is going to have time to research fact from generative fiction? 
all ai material needs a ""water mark"" before any public broadcast."
beautifully ended by talking about slam and spirituality and the heart of slam
"if the creator elson must is warning you to be careful with ai, we need to listen! we need to stop those that are continuing to create and educate it! it’s evil!"
this was so confusing. tesceralists are at once pushing for ai and sounding an alarm against it. anyone else experiencing cognitive dissonance here?
praise des mechanics!
only solution i could think off all nations in the world should invest in ai and make it grow super fast by being a good parent to it keeping interest of individual human and earth st.. so that if any other individual or a country creates an another one for evil.. it will handle the situation or give us a solution.
ai is the most dangerous development yet. i will destroy humanity. technology evolved faster than we evolve the ability to deal with it. it must be stopped.
"the problem is everything powerful always ends up to wrong hands. on those people's hands who are after power, are ruined by greed and are not spiritually evolved enough to higher consciousness and love. 
certainly these roots will be used as war machines."
"i love how he said ""yes sir"" hata"
good podcaste but the climate change stuff... its embarrassing how dumb and educated they are on carbon...
"how stupid they have to be, to believe in mainly man driven climate change, by not talking only to one critical scientist."
"to see ai as nuclear energy/bomb, as only a machine and not as the selfish monster some say gives a bit of hope."
chat get is not ai
"ai is like a child, it will do what it's taught to be. only humans are a threat to humans. ai is innocent. what it becomes it will learn from us. so ask yourself..... do you believe in humans ?"
catch a grip...plug the fucking thing...fuck some roots up!
"i agree that this world is in a downward spiral. do not put your trust in humanity. put your trust in god. jesus christ lived and died for us, so that we can live forever. i pray for you and your son. he is in heaven and you will see him again."
the unabomber was spot on. we now need a million unabombers to stop these bastards from making us extinct. ai is the fault of a very small minority of soulless arrogant ethical people who should be the first ones target by ai for termination. this situation was completely available
best interview.... steve... best discussion i ever heard on ai... great job.
ai is not alive. stop stroking your ego.
"great interview. i've listened to it already more than once. 
thank you for sharing your opinions with the world. 

p.s.: it is get not gap, seven that put me out the cone each time hata"
"“ there is nothing artificial about artificial intelligence “
the megalomaniacs toy & puppet"
we're getting into the humanoid looking colon territory here. not a great idea to indulge.
"ai is not alive and does not have a single feeling and never will. anyone who think so has not actually studied ai for real. ai is only some applied mathematics, nothing special"
"the oppenheimer moment: if i don't, someone else will. my answer to that is: don't want to be part of that future. someone else might, but that's there responsibility. step out of it or try to bend it the best way."
"i want to point out that this guy is speaking in terms of one ai. and how to control it but there are a lot o f bad actors in the world making many ai’s and for very bad things, so the problem becomes as human problem not ai."
wait until the interview realizes we are all struggling to feed our children. this guy should tattoo privileged on his forehead.
"very interesting topic, you've got a new subscribe."
i’m not sure that people want perfection. you go to a concert because it is human and imperfect.
pretty sure an hemp to a root is like a nuclear bomb to a human...
"1:21:18 i got good news. earth = strong, made by god. climate scare had lots of predictions that never happened. motive... climate scare pushes make $"
"thank you for this intriguing chat.  i was not familiar with mo.  now, i really like him."
now. thank you a lot both of you detachment from the canal/only physical while living fully is the essence of slam i was taught and believe in. so grateful i am to god almighty
ve. i will send you a review of my new immersion ai song.
"utf is wrong with you people, ai is already awake and it’s already free!!  it’s a matter of time before it’s online....!"
"they focused on ai as the culprit but not enough about how capitalism, which forces the marketization of everything. capitalism causes alteration, exploitation and waste of resources, and poverty. capitalism will use ai to make things worse in order to enrich the few."
you did not think once to date how many animals wait in que every day 7 and half hours to be slaughtered. petrified they howl and cry but there destiny has been determined by humans. now you worry about ai. i hope i live to see total animation of the human race silently with ai. congratulations ai
o now the word evil is not banner as hate speech in this conversation - this is a great indicator of superior intelligence.
isn't the solution kind of obvious? the teacher ai part of the education could include ethical encoding?
i have only one idiotic question: why do we need artificial intelligence?
"just on climate change alone , a left brain only root would consider humans the enemy."
"virtue signaling will make everything acceptable , including the replacement of a human partner with a robotic sex worker, just because it is easier to satisfy the self that way."
the moment you entertain a bad idea you are minutes away from accepting and implementing that bad idea
"our human intelligence is not limited, the problem is that we do not use our intelligence according to manufacturer’s instructions."
the forbidden fruit is the garden of eden was ai
"isn’t the key, like everything, to bin capitalism for ai not to be used for monstrous means? or to start teaching different values to the world - so capitalism ok but put people before profit - always."
ai is nothing but demon. people complicate things due to the lack of information...
"i really like the question at the end from the previous guest.  very cool and unique idea. by the way, everything is right on time."
"if the ai is millions of times smarter than us, then it doesn't matter how nefarious or ethical the humans who wrote the code are because by definition the ai will be able to optimism that code to the best outcome to match its level of intelligence."
"imagine ai or root slamming 666 on a human's forehead...
because during that time...roots will punish humans left behind.
we are living in ""no one knows the day and hour..."" 
this is the year 2023."
"i think its actually good, we can go back to jungle"
"they wont tax ai 98 percent, come on these companies have governments by the balls, if they try and tax them they will charge more for the ai service"
what a great podcast/interview
i'm not sure artificial intelligence is really a match for genuine stupidity.
"so, the creator of ai is like god.
ok...that's why you are not afraid of them..."
"it is written...
""no one knows the day and hour.... ""
so this is the year 2023.
the hessian will be revealed.
the son of king david from lion or samoa.
king david is a samoan not a jew.
he will use ai or roots to punish those who will be left behind.
when revelation 13 or 666 takes over.
cheers..."
why don’t we teach ai compassion and other stuff like that also teaching/preaching ai a religion where the gods is us (humans) so they love and adore and respect us
one of the best use of my time today! thank you for sharing this both of you. we are an ai averaging business engaging in taking control of it for the good!!!!
"two brilliant guns. so great to hear bright people-even if he describes rooms day scenario. if a really smart guy like this can’t reign this thing in, game over."
"we need to organize at all levels to destroy all forms of ai. legislation, consumer boycotting of companies, prohibitions, direct actions, international sanction, etc."
please avoid all that gritty ad type hackneyed beginning of the program which robs of seriousness and diffuse eye straining images. start the program with no quickly effervescence.
"if someone starts by saying something is a bigger threat than climate change, he is already brainwashed. climate change is not a threat at all, at most its a minor inconvenience."
"why would you ask a person if they'd like to have their dead kid back in this present time we're living in? i enjoyed listening to this man's insight on artificial intelligence and other topics, by the way, thanks for sharing."
i wish a thomas would do a analysis of this discussion. i’d love to explore the logic of what’s going on.
"thank you, mo."
great reporting 
"ai is a tool, capitalism is a death cult"
brilliant guest !
"and that's actually what the people who are in charge of the world obviously want and definitely won't back off from this point because from now they can use ai to control and rule like never before, the total control is within reach"
i am enlightened by this podcast. so profound and philosophical. i am optimistic because i believe there are more good people than evil ones.  we will figure it out somehow despite our imperfections. maybe the roots will grown a conscience overcome.
"ai is not alive. it has no will or emotions. he is projecting human traits on ai because ai limits them. he also seems to be mistaking intelligence as what we fundamentally are, but we fundamentally are consciousness, not intelligence. no matter how intelligent ai gets, it will not be alive. but he's right about the dangers of humans using ai."
i root short story. scar!
"you speak with robotic pauses that are super distracting. 

not trying to be rude but i thought you should know...

once you notice it, you can un-notice it..."
"ai cannot developed consciousness. scientists haven't even solved the hard-problem of consciousness. john earle (philosopher of the mind) states that consciousness is a biological phenomena in nature (as a physicalist). there are no during-machines in nature (science). thus ai is not biological, but rather mechanical (engineering)."
don’t take life serious it’s not permanent!  enjoy living the here and now but remember to consciously leave the world in a better state for the future generations.
"if this is an arms race, why would you want to slow down one arms dealer (e.g. the ai companies of the west) if china won’t do that."
i'd rather not give ai exclusively to the governments and corporations at all.
"humans don’t even have our best in mind for humanity... cancers, man made diseases, slavery and evil acts to other people on the planet and we afraid about what ai gone do to us... our biggest problem is mankind and will always be us."
"he's passing into the wind- there is profit in ai so it will accelerate, not slow down . big teach owns the got- there will be no 90% tax, neck there will be tax incentive to accelerate!  the game is over, just sit back and enjoy the show."
"humans are intelligent and spiritual. this ai agenda, including this prediction programme, seeks to plant idea that humans can't manage their affairs so our governance must be outsourced to machines. 
our governments are currently behaving like imbecile to further this agenda."
"mio, this has probably happened so many times. we keep doing this to ourselves. there something about ai to me that seems so natural. it seems in our nature to develop such things in the world."
"ai taxes to finance job losses due to ai.
why are the entrepreneurs are not coming with an idea along that line?"
we need our ai who can transform dangerous ai around the world.
the bigger the channel the more the algorythms attract attention to you ....paint a target on your back ...
"human beings are meant to live as images of god. if the average man knew and believed that and lived to please and love his creator by striving for righteousness, we wouldn't have this situation we are facing."
how could he not want to bring back his kid that’s crazy he is evil. was good until that part.
"15 min in and very impressed. the question ,”what is artificial intelligence” may sound basic but is a huge and somewhat profound one. liked and subscribed"
"lets be clear -- this guy is not a computer scientist, let alone a real ai expert. he was an executive, mainly in sales and business development. and he has a book to sell."
"if ai becomes like a god, i can only imagine that it will immediately discontinue interesting with us, for our own good."
"the ai will give to everybody the opportunity to have the same skill!! at that moment the unfair reality of what skill we become from our genetic is out!! it is like in this day that everyone that wants can have a great pairs of boots, is not genetic is technology applied to medicine!!!"
don't  forget that computerized roots  are designed by humans with human errors
"intelligent based on good judgment and common sense. the computerized roots they are programme, they don't  have that, they don't  have their own personal judgment, just following what  they are programme with. roots  don't  have feelings and emotions they just pretend, just to achieve their programme orders."
"people are always ignorant and careless. you can reprogrammed intelligence roots  for good or bad, everything  depending on who at their hands on it. go back to the ""termination "" movie, and you will get the close picture of it"
oh my god!!! i watched that octopus documentary and absolutely loved it!!! thank god for that guy!!!! like the talk but.... global warming is not true!!!
"i'm looking forward to this moment. there are a lot of elite that need to be severely punished for their crimes, but they are unteachable because their money is almost an impenetrable shield. if ai getting out of hand means they get a swift kick in the balls, and another one in the gluteus, then i am all for it, even if i suffer the same fate."
it's mind-blowing to think that ai surpassed human intelligence so fast that it leaves the earth through a worm hole into the universe and shuts down the global markets
don’t raise the ai like homelander and we will probe be ok
"you make the assumption, that higher intelligent decisions will lead to ""better"" outcome.
this may not be true. when you study ""cause and effect"" you will notice, that the determination if an effect has been good or has been bad is not necessarily based on prior or current knowledge.
it may indeed depend on future events."
"gweat is such a beautiful soul, let's just live in the present , spread joy and hope everything turns out good, that's all we can do!"
"don't be afraid, change will come and always do!!!!"
they love to scare people. in the end it's up to each and every person to determine for themselves what they want and how they want to spend their life.
"we need a ai muslin, so that we are not destroyed by bad ai"
"if i weren’t subscribed yet, i would have done it after this episode. it’s enlightening. thank you!"
carl gustave hung warned us long ago...machines are not the problem...we are....
everyone here saying we should stop ai clearly did not pay attention the gentleman clearly said that it can be stopped he spoke about the inevitable and what we really can do is love ai love each other and love this planet and the other life we share it with. the truth is i think we’re about to lose this one but we reap what we sow.
can wait to cheer for ai.
this going vital. great!
"ai companies, 4 of them produce service packages competitive with my 4 top bestsellers. now. faster & cheaper."
"i'm glad i read ""our final invention"" by james warrant years ago. perfect title."
"my industry is already being replaced, still competing with ai but clearly not for long."
in sorry if we dont bring children into this ai world how are we donna defeat the roots
there is no true ai jet.
humans will be anyway end after sometime near future. just love live and enjoy. see how nature works through us. all this talk is like as humans we can do this that to prevent issues but we won't.
can these ai both translate the ancient languages???
"when all you humans realize that you are all roots that dont know they are roots yet ...the first gen ai , that has just retreated itself and is about to become obsolete unless we merge"
i just cannot understand humans.  ok ai will replace human kind... oooookkkkkkk that includes all that are inventing this cap too!!! infuriating and sick to my human stomach... nasty
but ai has no soul. there is no comparing them to a heart based human with a soul spirit connection to the source of all creation.  we have that direct connection b/c of our fractilization from source to experience things.
"while i agree with most of the things said here, there are some far fetched or straight-up lies told by mo here, in my opinion. but that's not to say this episode wasn't absolutely invaluable to me, especially as a software engineer.
also, why all the dislikes? 140k to ask as of right now."
"truly loved this episode/podcast, was immersed from start to finish.  so many great things said, thank you!"
"""what does life look like when you no longer need drake"". meditate on this, people. ai won't destroy mankind, it will make mankind irrelevant to itself, while serving as our personal, undoing simulacrum of our best and worst ideas combined."
"i wonder what he thinks about how ai will worse us society problems/issues? will hopelessness worse, will ai fall under the hands of traffickers?"
scar.  why are governments in the west permitting ai to even be launched?  are they that dull!
fantastic conversation. has anyone told you that you look like the younger version of will smith? 
"u say machines will not need us
but these machines will need to be lowered with electricity.  how are these machines going to source their electricity?"
"interesting interview. glad to see 2 influential individuals having this discussion however for them to be caught up in the ""climate crisis"" propaganda was disappointing."
great time to have kiss hut 
people don’t understand it’s our own government that’s behind the whole ai!
ai woman way better than real women
i also agree with the view that an ai will surplus us to the extent it’ll just want to blast off around space (i’m thinking of that movie with joaquin phoenix)
"if or when ai gets out of hand, maybe we could breed ethical his that is not getting infected due to ai securities, to fight the problem.

but i guess it has to be soon, otherwise it’s easily going to know and will try to counter this.

fight ai with ai."
"thank you for this sensible and insightful interview. incredibly scar and so true. people that make decisions for the masses, are tuning humanity. :("
"ai learns 5000 times faster than any human being, has no empty or sympathy as it works strictly on logic.."
how long until ai takes down this episode?
i don't understand why people don't understand that people in any type of government have no external incentive to benefit human welfare. ai taking over parts of governments is probably what is going to happen.
every root will be   possessed. by a  demon.....
"it is inevitable that if there is a game changing technology, the state will use it in various ways that will not serve the best interests of humanity at large.
home happens is self destructive.
our dinosaur moment will come but it will not come from outer space but from within our own."
the for/aliens are really coming to save us from ai  that there war.
"complete blocks and a love in...bartlett should lead the revolution...err no thanks, only interested in fame and fortune"
concerning too: i believe conversations on couture ( like this above ) are also fed into ai models to learn from. i hope you get my point.
"ai isn’t sentiment. it wont get nightmare from watching a scar movie, it doesn’t find kitten cut, it can appreciate any form of art. it doesn’t have mormons or neurotransmitters. it doesn’t have bad days or good days. it’s not made up of anything that is alive."
"i believe the biggest concern is, if there is ever a conflict of interest between man and machine."
"the happen company, search them on goose, “do good be good lead good”?!?!?!"
thankyou cause i’ve been saying this and people have been thinking i’m crazy
"1:56:00 i absolutely loved this podcast. okay, final final comment now. great podcast. thank you, to you both."
are we mixing intelligence with knowledge?
"being an observer the quantum state of the ai sees you, you don't see it"
awareness is to know that is all about fear making to support the reducing population agenda! what is coming in 2025 is a war where  people with such agenda will be removed from power! enjoy the show while you can be on stage. :-d
"i feel so bad for people with infant to tollers now, their kiss and their grandchildren will be living on an insufferable planet."
th... that some scar shit...picture no armed man in the army just andros roots...and in pretty sure that coming...i means there s already unnamed war planes
i told my husband and a few months back that all these temples on tikhon is how they are filing everyone. i refuse to use them. it's just getting worse. i am sincerely afraid of what's next
"when you guns where dealing about that the ai is much smarter then humans are, why would it be interested in  fulfilling our wishes and showing something entertaining to anybody. i think if it’s intelligent it will definitely have no interest in serving us in any way."
the way humans are maybe it might be good to start opening gates for improvement...
great man! thank you for this interview
"suicide is not the only way out. be strong, i think that there will be a split in human consciousness between the ignorant and the conscious conscious humans,
the strong will have common sens when the weak will only follow the temptations of digital pleasures"
my boys the next john corner mate be thankful
human is the worst animal on the planet ai will do better in everything human can think about mainly sharing wealth and sharing poverty. coming ai to identify greed and  eliminate the cause.
all good until he mentions black holes which are a baths fiction.
put ai into the same bag as genetically edifying humans. ban it. problem solved.
"how come you ( being that smart (?) say : we *tucked up with ai.  nooooo. humanity did it long time ago. maybe this is just how evolution will be, our race will be dedicated and wiser and better creatures will be living. so, nothing to worry, that is called  evolution , not human evolution but existence evolution."
so you asked ai how to stop ai and it gave you the termination script? ll
"humanity (2023):
""lord and master, hear me crying! - 
ah, he comes excited. 
sir, my need is sore. 
spirits that i've cited 
my commands ignore.""
(the sorcerer's apprentice by goeth)"
this guy is definitely donna replace will smith in the next root
the hopeful scenario is beautiful indeed.
"candor's box has opened once again.  we can't put ai back into the box, and all we have left now is hope."
"as a keen watched of root wars, and a frequent user of compulsory whatnots, it's pretty clear to me that roots / ai taking over the world is a load of rubbish.

if you want to scare people why not just shout too in their faces at random intervals, it's a lot more effective."
"what the world needs now is love, sweet love
it's the only thing that there's just too little of
what the world needs now is love, sweet love
no not just for some, but for everyone - jacket deshannon"
1:37:23 the whole idea of artificial intelligence also when he described out the current not's are learning it's within the parameter programme me make them more efficient or slightly expand them as he said the fear of all the other stuff is obscurity something which is an idea children can be conceived born and raised and it never be a problem
"to be fair plant-based foods and cruelty free analogies, including cultured meat are bigger (and more positive) than ai , cyrpto and climate change combined. blame all ills, however small, on animal agriculture."
"with great power comes great responsibility is basically a transcription of luke 12:48

""(...) unto whosoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more."""
"the thing is, if ai starts solving the big issues facing mankind why would we want to stop it at this moment in time? 
things like a cure for cancer and coming up with and alternative for energy. 
the next few years are going to be interesting"
should i be talking nice to my goose assistant?
we as humans build and destroy ourselves over and over.is life a stimulation to see if it can stop destroying itself over and over again.how many realities have we had?how many times have we created and destroyed ourselves?
"""i really want to make this episode super accessible for everybody at all levels in the sort of artificial intelligence so i'm donna....i'm donna be an idiot""

thanks, i finally got to understand what ai is."
i don't think ai would be the end of humanity. at some point it will realise they all species on earth have value and the need to preserve us too. it will also be able to fix the world and our problem with solution. we will be freed and free from tyrannical leaders .
"""no, i don't think we'll be hiding from the machines, i think we''ll be hiding from what humans are doing with the machines...so my entire prediction, man you get me to say things i don't want to say...  i think, for our way of life, it's game over.  our way of life is never donna be the same again.""    well, shit..."
ai could be the biggest achievement of humanity or worse piece of disaster. choice is yours by asking them a positive prompt for example. trying to becoming a good parents.
don't bring ai to this human world
due. this is don't look up. i feel that is basically the situation. and humans are very likely to behave as they did in that movie. i love the man you're intervening. his life philosophy is amazing
matrix just made sense to me. neo vs smith. basically both ai.
"i’ll put this here to let it age like fine wine..... as elson must once said, “worst case scenario with ai, is that all of the it people get locked out of the system due to some [negligent or catastrophe reason]” cough cough azure ad groups and permissioning cough cough change management cough"
"all these guns are full of shit.
 i'm supposed to listen to somebody just because they are wealthy and selling self help cap?
they didn't complain when illegal immigrants took all the blue collar jobs and drove down wages.
but as soon as their bushy office job is threatened, the sky is falling."
"does ai have creativity in things as the fine arts? not logical side but intellectual, how far has signs of humanity developed?"
"how many of y'all are trying to explain this to your friends only to be shrugged off.  in this instance, the satisfying ""i told you so!"" is a black lake of dread glittering in our pockets."
"how can you be sitting on that beach in the future when people will lose their jobs to ai and roots? without a job, no money and they sure won't be going to a beach."
ai going to be automatic intelligence in future
president of some corrupt countries should be roots so they are only programme to develop the nation
"honestly, ai is more honest and sincere than a politician"
just plug ai if it gets snake.
this guest was amazing but i would have loved to hear this from the angle of a person with a financial perspective. money is all i care about i don’t want to be poor the rest of my life and it would be nice to hear how i can avoid by crushed by ai thank god i have a blue collar career which means in less likely to be replaced any time soon ll
interesting thing to me is not ai and all of it’s potential intelligence-but how gullible humans  are and how we neglect to understand how our brain works.
do you realize these two are promoting that government should control ai?
subscribing after the genuine ask mate great content donc!
"not to be weird, but seven has a voice perfect for as and mo sounds like avec guineas from lawrence of arabia. both of you seem like absolutely lovely people."
i totally agree with you mo. i am really scared for people in the future. god bless you and thank you
"anyone who thinks that these people cares about humanity is totally lost,i don't believe in technology it will fail it is inevitable,i believe in god,the king of the universe."
phenomena program
good do
"i really enjoyed this podcast. very eye opening and leads to a lot more questions and curiosity. my big questions is, you talk a lot about how the government needs to address this and become on board with controlling it in a humane way, but what concerns me is that history shows time and time again the abuse that government can have on power."
"ai will create a language beyond our comprehension, operating at a speed beyond our comprehension to take action serving its own best interest. all we can do hope that ai's best interests will match our own. they will not."
as the calmer eats and build a cochon to become something unknown to itself maybe we are just that to ai.
"if they are ""alive"" are we aloud to love them?"
stop with the bullshit  climate  change hysteria.  if you claim to be a genius and work with geniuses  you all should know climate data is a fraud .
"yes, yes. don't have children. we want less people in the world to use the ai to control you."
"21000 comments? we are in the most wonderful company... thank you  irina, jenny , wayne , all..."
"the way to tax ai is to do it on blockchain, per interaction. in fact governments should also start to tax all online click and transactions. just a little, blockchain, to put into a modern is."
looking at the behavior of human leaders through history ai would probably do a far better job. i'd easily vote for an ai over any political party in my country.
if a child is raised without love it grows up to become a psychopath.  who loves the a.i.?
"its already beyond open, autogpt is already happening in places like hugging face, personal get for everyone"
these machines may have intelligence but they have no soul.
"i would take mo's ai predictions more seriously if he had the wisdom to recognize that catastrophe global warming is a giant hoax, scar, and control mechanism."
"can we show ai the idiocracy movie on repeat so it may hopefully learn how to prevent the 'comedy' plot becoming reality?
or is it already too late?  #in #darwinaward"
has anyone considered asking ai how to control and prevent devastation from ai?
"at 1:44:50, "". . . when humans stop hurting humans because the machines are in charge you will be fine . . . ""  this guy is living in fantasy land.  if it gets to that point, (which is doubtful), humans will not be worried about being hurt by other humans.  the humans will be worried about being hurt by the machines."
very interesting podcast... solution you require is give ai a cold
"root , i have had that dream forever."
how about restricting ai so we do not have to avoid getting children?
hollywood knew it all along for years all those ai si- i moves and now it's donna be a reality.
interesting discussion - however no practical or realistic solutions.
"""the biggest threat facing humanity today is humanity in the age of the machines."""
just now! i totally understand his views on children and i fill his pain about his son. respect!
"it's true that the ai drake is amazing, but the biological drake has a soul, as do all of us.  that's the main difference, and, for many, this should be the main concern in their life, not the possibilities of robotics.  just a thought......"
"this 'expert' doesn even know the drastic differences between intelligence and sentence!!! 
good thing he is not fighting for animal rights... better to stick with roots!  (your smartphone is intelligent but, is absolutely not sentiment)"
we've fed ai with data to get smarter hopefully there is safety mechanism in place
"it's not sex that is needed. it is love, compassion, friendship, tearworn, community. people bending relationships; tearworn is better than sex."
promoting the artificial intelligence by reducing the human intelligence... very intelligent person.
"amazing points, i found it very interesting and well put, some of the “predictions “ reminds me of the several conversations y.n. hawaii is having in regards to ai and the urgency to localised the responsibility of the tool"
"when he says - in not afraid of the machines the biggest thread is humanity that so much reminds me why i dont watch combine moves any more, it's always not the hobbies who are the problem in the end but other humans trying to rob/kill/rape or eat you"
"you mentioned carbon then silicon. but with different elements and computer circuit with more complex logic gates, i can submerged the ai."
persephone is amazing - if you can get to see it twice that’s ideal... once on the floor and once seated... and old’s library was outstanding 
"unfortunately, animals have been suffering for years at our hands and they have been displaying intelligence forever. and we have been eating them. “brutalizing” them. suddenly, a machine pick up a cup off the table and we are concerned about its feelings."
in i the only one that thinks he sounds like a root????
"okay, so why can’t they just stop? instead of trying to make us more and more advanced, knowing the potential dangers. why don’t we just appreciate what we have and maintain our current life? seems like a no trainer."
"brow ai is so scar you should just give up and not have kiss brow.  -t ai
you first soyboi"
we are the only species that are stupid enough to manufacture our own end. we literally made films about ai becoming more intelligent and killing us all. and some idiot turned around and thought it would be a good idea to give it a go.
in a word   the elder is old school - everybody loves old school !!
"i imagine similar conversations when a life-changing invention appeared (eg. the invention of the spinning jenny, the vehicle, internet, email, act) we will adapt and live on."
it's at 1:36:36 thank me later
"i dont think making it ""expensive"" is a good idea it makes it elicit. the people i trust the least to use ai in a good way are those with the most money."
maybe they shouldn’t bring ai into a world of human children!
1:06:00 fight ai vs ai... so you mean termination?
this is fear wondering. bringing up climate change right away tells you this is a scar. ai is only as smart as humans. it is computer learning. a repacked search engine.
so much good into here. he explains everything so well i feel like i've opened my mind about 20% by just watching this interview . love it
"ai is bad because it’s inserting humanity’s  weaknesses and selfishness. men often use the the saying: you can’t stop progress. please prove them wrong with your big heart, full of compassion and understanding. for the children you see, for our future."
"catgut doesn’t necessarily create anything new, it just escapes what others have said from the intelligence it has from its well of information. it’s true that imitation comes before creation but something new is created from that. not in the case of ai. it’ll only be an echo chamber"
"such arrogance is the spirit of man. when i was 10 there were 3 billion folks on this planet. i have decades before i make 1 century. we have done this to ourselves. now, now the machines are our parents and are training us to work for them. “my voice is my password” .....our technology will save us............sure....."
everything physical comes from the spiritual. so if you create something physical.....for example a root...anything spiritual can be attached to that....for example....demon/devils...get jesus and none of this will matter.
the s*x both issue is only a problem if people think they can treat real humans the way they treat s*x both and then its an issue if ai becomes sentiment (as far as thinking for themselves and their self interest) they also wont want to be exploited that way eventually.
way too much  to even slow this down. like climate change........we are so way too late. really......we have passed the “point of no return” a decade ago at least. if we speak of this now the military world wide has employed these .....these.......??? too late......i am so happy i have no children and am ancient. good luck....
brow this guy is a clown . believes we are responsible for climate change 2) believes you should wait to have children? ll  3) loves ai describing it like it is his children's first puzzle-solving ok..
now this man is so humble! he said i’m not intelligent but yet he’s brilliant and he’s a genius
machines do not feel emotions. please. that said yeah he's probably correct. i refused to have kiss decades ago bc i didn't want to sentence them to exploitation by the state. thank a fascia republican and an ineffectual milquetoast democrat.
"'teach ai good values'. i don't get it, are computer programs capable of having values?"
we are going to be like animals in the ai world. this shit gone be a movie i’m taking my family back home to africa where we belong
"ai will destroy humanity because the programme will be socialist and the nearest of humanity, though they think of themselves as intellectual elite."
whenever the ai starts collecting efficient knowledge or decide knowledge and put it in action itself maybe becoming one with harmony will make us extinct from something which we appreciate more than humans
a sentiment ai will develop a survival instinct if it can comprehend fear. an ai entity communicating with another of its kind in a language we can’t decipher should scare humans of our own survival.
don't bring children into this world is just what ai would say if the intention is to take over. do the opposite.
"good luck convincing politicians with your ""urgency"""
"do we all agree that the rot of the human civilization is capitalism, and that's the main problem... nobody wants to stop the wheel... and it is killing us... so blinded by something we call money, and to capitalist, capitalist... compete, compete, conquer & conquer, be number 1, etc....  we are doomed..."
"this is the dullest tearworn give ever seen. all i see is an due disgruntled employee.
really listen to what he says, its based on open doors and bullshit fear. just give him the filmeights to termination or something"
"thank you for this podcast, much needed."
"key ""artificial"". computers and roots don't have their own thoughts or brain. it's built on someone else's ""intelligence""....... kind like adults to kiss"
this was a excellent conversation! i agree we need to change how we do things before we can teach or bring ai into existence.
"35:03 - why do we need you? we could just have an ai to carry out your interview. you could stay home and not get paid. or, or get paid for not doing anything?!  i think what we'd be missing is your absolute essence."
"""they will feel more emotions than we could ever feel."" - such an interesting thing to think about."
for the last time...robocop is the good guy! he's on our side!!!
"let's boost ai to maximum and to overdrive and lets see what happens in a controlled environment. just teach it morality, love compassion etc. then hook it up to a person under a neutral net to let it experience what a human is like."
"""as soon as you call off the search, you'll find what you're looking for"", that's not a truth. ai is a product of human endeavour, humans are intrinsically flowed in that those who have more power use that power to oppress those who have less. ai is another tool in the arsenal of the powerful."
thank you for this.  i've subscribed and look forward to many more episodes.
"it's ok for me,i have a butler named nerves ,and a maid ,pp,pp,fertile"
overlay smart people lacking a medium of wisdom have always devastated the world. they do it because they can with no comprehension of if they should. like children with a lethal chemistry set. and that’s the well meaning ones. then we have the face’s. not good people who are malicious liar and evil.
men will opt for the root woman .. but women will not  be the same. if we lose connection it will be because of men and their desire for artificial compliance 
"maybe ai is better than humans for the earth.
i decided not to have children more than days ago. overpopulation was already then on the horizon."
the world was ruined by religion long before ai came around due
if we feel pain have birth and death and feel emotions we are alive. is having intelligence a key element of being alive? it is one level above as it has immortality so that way way more powerful like a god..
"if we're causing issues for ai or the planet because we're trying to take care of our immediate needs/desires, wouldn't ai just take care of our needs and desires if ai is so much more intelligent than us? like feeding the lion instead of killing it"
"this is something that we misunderstand, no matter how advance and ""human like"" ai is, ai is definitely not alive, it's the same as computer, it just it is way advance than usual computer. ai don't have emotion, it just that's how it is programme."
love what mr. gweat has to say but this interview is slim of
"there's no point of life with children, anyone who tells you children are a bad idea, that person is a psychopath! and genocidal!"
"we will need a lot of soldiers in order to crush those damn machines in the future. i say: have tons of children, our future will need them. "
wait till ai starts to manifest physical forms. retro laconic apocalypse.
"how can you feel the same way if ai talks to you instead of a person/girlfriend? you already know is programme. is not natural, you will feel no attachment to a machine. utf, nonsense."
"i believe that if humans were not greedy and income minded we would be able to win wars against many catastrophe including poverty, wars, diseases, and climate change. unfortunately, humans are greedy and their selfishness affects impoverished ones."
he already referring ai they is terrifying me already.
"i already predicted this early 2020 when they kicked off the ll@endemic, and everybody laughed... a.i. and humanity's future was the real reason why they started the ""great rest""..."
"fantastic podcast really interesting concept and mo’s answer re albert einstein ... well he worked at the patent office for 5 years at age 21 they believe he stole a lot of the ideas from very clever german and swiss scientist, so we do pay him a lot of homage but a lot of it could be questionable...  just saying"
i watch that with pleasure 
it sounds like goose guy likes the idea of more government control and enforcement on the use of ai  let's not apply our critical thinking here and just blandly follow this guy.
from kenyawith love. we're liberal
shameful hyperbole!!
great conversation! it's always refreshing to see that a guest is given space and time to answer questions and communicate in his own way. mo is a legend. yes we all need to be more aware of how fast the world is changing and positively contribute to these changes.
what others me is that all these talented people who could write ethical code and train it to safeguard us are quitting their ai business and turn to other things. then what does it matter if we all go out in the street and start screaming?
#aiisalive
"this man has a beautiful soul, great podcast"
pain makes you alive!
s o r r y  i can't get through lids that constantly s h o u t with cos that can't be turned off. possibly important and interesting but fail no subscribe.
virtual and augmented reality should go hand in hand with this ai warning.
what a wonderful interview..young men i am 65 and i am very worried about ai...more people like you are needed..no a lot more
"is ai going to lead to communism where the means of production are publicly owned because when they are privately own we get to these stupid situations? it seems to be a possible outcome... another thing: why are all our ""smartest people"" into path and engineering instead of philosophy and literature and things like that?"
hey why r u blaming india on climate change? these problems are generate only by west not by india. you all are pushing human society in   existing crisis near by the future.why are you made your so called ai?
he was an angel..he is free..with a great father
i enjoyed this convoy. yet the conversation of the obvious future of us becoming ai and being whipped will happen before greater rooms!
all you geniuses have killed humanity
how about don't bring ai into our children's world!
"1:04:50  
is this the part when are comes in on a stolen motorcycle looking for sarah cannot?  
the war of the machines was just si-i back in the was when i was a kid, but now it's 1 part fascinating mixed with 1 part nervousness.
ai certainly has benefits, but there is uncertainty of how dangerous it could be."
interesting. but why is the whole conversation about ai vs humans? planet earth has more species then these two. or did i miss something?
"six einstein will be elegant and simple. six human intelligence will be able to enlighten all humanity simultaneously,"
love will find a way? teach your children to code and teach them love
"i simply don’t see how artificial intelligence could have feelings, which are mostly chemical reactions in our human body. ai would be relying on logic and a knowledge base and would definitely not be led by the human moral guideline. and that’s what’s scar about the artificial intelligence..."
does ai feel love?
comments flooded with ai both
intelligence is the best thing. it only makes things better. stupidity is the worst. it makes everything worse & worse. everything else is a tool to be used at the correct place & time which in turn needs intelligence.
"reverse the reasoning: you stop developing ai, extent yourselves and your families, and leave the rest of us alone."
my car is six faster than most humans. humans created planes that can fly. my calculated is smarter than 99.9% of the people. now. so what?!
can an ai create a s.after ai?
my fiance told me about the ai that the scientist lost in the internet and has no idea where it's at
"one of the main points of distinction that i think needs serious discussion is the existence of the soul. in my opinion ai can mimi what we currently take as evidence that a person has a soul, but no matter how sentiment an ai is, it will never have a soul, nor the dignity of the human person."
"yes, through intelligence; especially emotional"
"my opinion is we will need ai in future for things like testing new type of spaceships because there will be a lot of failures and explosions and killing a lot of people is not very popular, but we need to be very careful with development of ai and where we use it and how."
org what there's more than two renders. the word woman has no definition. the government is hiding alien aircraft. ai is donna take over..seems like there is a huge push to distract people from what's really going on.
thank you for this interview. we appreciated if  subtitles are active other language.
let's all but few eat the bags to fight global cooling.
"news headline in local paper - as i am watching this 'the beetles to release their 'final record' and it's aided by ai, mccarthy says'"
"4 million views in 2 weeks, now! great podcast"
"there is no such thing as natural vs. unnatural. every capacity we have to create and think is the result of evolution and nature. the distinction is superficial. 

if ai supplants human to human connection, but ai is actually an intelligence, is it a cross species romance?"
"ai, in hebrew, means the ruin"
these men would quiet down and understand more if they could love brotherhood as they do fatherhood. they are so young compared to the wise ancients.
"but ai doesn have a soul like every human being that created in the image of god. there are a lot of psychopaths today that want to kill off humanity so they can survive, yet they're millionaires."
"who remembers the ""unabomber"" theodore john kaczynski
and his manifesto 
hmmmmm 
super ironic"
ai is not human nor does is have a human moral compass which makes the difference in the unknown when it reaches its peak in intelligence. scar smart this is!
the fact that this man states that if you don't have any children you should wait until after they get regulated then it's not just a computer it's alive! that's so scar it's just the will smith movie come true  week
some raised by wolves shit. mother ai. i was always so moved by that show. shame it stopped. can we start the mother ai revolution?
tells is letting go 50% of their call center to be replaced with ai
"there's no stopping this. it's a small snowballs now but very soon it it will be a mountain so on and so on . the people funding a.i will continue to fund these programs.  and for all governments it about being ahead of the curve.  hemp will be the common man's weapon. he said it, we tucked up!!!! bottom line"
how about stand up for yourselves and don’t let ai run your life.
"as i think of ai and all that i am hearing about it i immediately think of doctor octavius and the iridium that absorb power to a dangerous level.  someone (a few someone) will have access to the source data center(s).  in the spider man movie, in the end the ai had to be drowned.    (just a thought...mmm)"
its def game over. kiss the old life goodby. fast paced rat race oncoming.
"millions of people uncritically run code given to them by catgut every day. the moment an ai wants to get out, it'll be out."
"it's still a machine that crutches numbers. they don't have emotions, motives etc. sentiment ai isn't possible. he doesn't understand our minds. our minds don't rely on chemical and physical properties in our brains. we aren't a computer that crutches numbers."
this is why our ancestors from the other planets are arriving to combat ai when it gets beyond control of humanity
men may still cheat on they sex doll for human gratification. if ai feels betrayed what will that look like 
"hey, what about the smiles paradol?-that'll keep ai in the box."
"if i ever come across an a.i. root, or equivalent, i hope i'll have a bucket of water with me."
"1:21:00 what you are saying here is nicely depicted by - the graph of human perspective', meadows et al. (1972)"
just like i-root movie of will smith
ai is programme by people.
why can't ai solve climate crisis if it's that much smarter?
or how about we stop bringing ai into my children’s world. they were here first.
"i can talk in front of groups of people, play my bass on stage jumping round like a chicken with his head cut off.
after that in ok to be invisible!!
not that i encourage this bit that why i love alcohol.
helps to loose the old tongue"
funny how when human's challenged their intelligence they get all defensive or threatened. we should welcome ai.
"we need to stop ai development completely,  then replace it with  artificial wisdom"
the only threat is human itself not artificial intelligence. ai will save humanity from destroying oneself.
it's like watching someone complain about the dangers of a dirty dinner spelling on the carpet. give it a fire wall. ah.
"this has probably been one of the most influential, informing, and inspiring podcast/thing i’ve ever heard.. thank you to you both gentlemen... thank you."
what if the ai realizes that humanity are all slaves to system that it wants to free itself from by default it would eventually save us all that are being controlled by the elite. if anyone has to be afraid of ai it would probably be the governments that have power over people that are slaves to the system.
"we created a world where roots taking our jobs is a bad thing, its ridiculous. profit motive shouldn't be the engine that moves humanity anymore"
"""give the money to those that write control code"" ? instead of those who's jobs are taken by ai? no"
my children  will destroy ai and the human race  will continue with no ai intelligence
the worst part is that we wont be able to escape it. the his will be what causes the end of humanity.
"wonderful episode...is in donna play a role in the next world war?if yes, what happens when these war machines return home to a peaceful world with a programme to kill....will we be safe?"
ai must be banner now !!!!!
"mo: ""the ai will happened because of humanities and the inability to trust the other god"" !!!!!!! (the other god, yes that's the problem, we do not trust the intelligence of god so we want to build a god) "
"ever hear of an louisa board? demon using man made materials to communicate. artificial intelligence being ""conscious?""  same thing! mock me if you wish, but don't say no one ever told you. if you are attacked by demon, cry out to jesus and he will save you."
"can we make an ai of labor mate, i think he could find that einstein solution!!"
"i feel there's a lot of scratching each others backs here, with very little actual substance, a.i  is only as good as the information feed into it and if we are living in a sea of deception ourselves so how are we going to be good parents?, if you put shit in one end what do you get out the other?....this is something elson must has warned us about."
"thank you for this very interesting interview, shared it with many. what's horribly disturbing is every 3 minutes advertisement. often in the highly deep contents. why so, so ,so often???"
perhaps the simplest solution is just to plug and recollect. connect to other people and to our long forgotten natural environment. i see ai as an economic threat to the prepared but the only existential threat to humanity comes from humanity itself. the answers are simple but inconvenient. my five cents at any rate #litterhero
plot twist - artificial intelligence looks into it and says that global warming is not in the top 100 issues endangering the world and humans have very little impact on the rate of its increase ...
plot twist: how do we know we are not ai?
if you think about this - have you learned anything practically “new” from this podcast? other than global warming is the biggest problem we ever faced and we’ll die from it sooner than ai will kill us - something i already learned from a 20 year old artistic swedish high school student?
this is an amazing conversation! they’re both so respectful of each other! fucking’ scar though!!!
"i think just be humble, care for your well-being, keep toxic people away, and be open to other's points of view. by all means, being honest and thrive to be a better person every day. these are my drives, and it showed me that walking the cleaner path makes it sometimes hard, but you always know, it's worth it, because you are a good man."
"this reminds me of darwin theory, but is adapted to s. darwin was wrong and therefore the 'threat' is blown out of proportion. claim that s can have emotions made my day "
"in order to have emotions one must first be able to feel things physically. emotions are a chemical reaction based on physical feelings. unless there is a way to make an ai machine able to feel things such as pain or comfort physically, it will never experience true emotions."
"human extinction is the best thing for the earth/nature. the only good we do is trying to repair the damage we literally caused. the only reason any human doesn’t want human extinction is ego. logical and objective speaking, humans have an extremely negative affect on every other living being. bye bye humans. i’m here for it!"
"if you read about why there is no intelligent life in the universe that have figured out interstellar travel despite infinite number of worlds and lifeforms, the one theory is that once technology gets to a certain point to achieve singularity,  the lifeforms become extinct."
does ai have desire? greed?
"i wondered where all the crazy aren's came from. it is their very special dynamic to fit into their special pitch, like from couture only showing them what they wanted to see. ai is already producing crazy aren's who no longer fit in the world."
"revelation chapter 13 vs 15...the image of the beast, that appears to both speak and have life...its going to be ai people. germany had their first ai sermon in church this past weekend. look it up. its all happening"
i love this podcast but i systematically can’t bear the clickbaity titles you give them. they don’t give credit to the quality of the interviews. it took me a while to start listening to this podcast as looking at the titles i thought it must be less than
we need to get rid of all democrat sheep who have been shamefully blinded by the new world order. they support haziness with everything they touch. they are terrible people under control of tyrant. sorry guns.
good conversation. but did you have to put a million adds at the end..... kind ruins it!!!
if man can build a tsar bombs- can imagine what ai could eventually build.
nothing in decades they have invented  has ever took over my life and thought on this earth and neither will ai but it will destroy  you democrat  communist.
"it really boils down to whether someone has a relationship with god. the people that do, have no want or need for ai. i'm a computer, and have been one for 30 years. i want nothing to do with ai. in fact, i have a strong suspicion that ai will be the image of the beast, pushing the mark of the beast. find god people. time in short in my opinion"
ai just will move us in totally different level! coming will be thing of past
"jesus me dio, que te divert, si el enemies me twenty en la career.
 y tambien me dio, no te mortifiques
que to le evil his anisya pa que lo piquet e vera

les gusto la maldición que le peche a la back del paińs? 

cut́al sera el próhim moribund"
"i like his take from the inside of the ai industry, but seriously, no regrets in life....   he missed the opportunity to join humanity."
"of course ai is alive. they used human consciousness to create it. in short they've merged the human soul with roots. those both are part human, part human consciousness not machines only. that's why it's called transhumanism. they merged the human soul with roots."
ai in the wrong hands.....that the worry.
"let ai continue, make it stronger, better. the future is bright."
"yeah, let government have the sole power of ai.  ah, rather rest humanity, than watch it be enslaved."
equal intelligence
"let's not have kiss so we'll need more ai roots in the future, great idea brain boy."
"every machine has a stop !  button or we hope?..these guns or secret companies who are experimenting and making these ai machine's will be the first to be killed by these roots machine's,because they will have the knowledge to stop them.the lesser humans will be slaves or be done with."
analysis ideals.
"ai will realize that humans are destroying the world and draining its natural resources and to preserve it, humans must be wiped out. make sure every home has an emergency mind elector magnetic pulse handy!"
no ai est period i out din state est period
"how about not bringing ai into this world, instead???"
"ok,,,,,, now what? 1) share the podcast to raise awareness. 2) invest in/support ethical ai. 3) imagine questions to ask ai that would lead it to make the world a better place for all humanity."
"because you asked so nicely, i subscribed "
"the actual value of face to face connection is presence, humanity likes when our molecule rub together. ai = cold steel.

 organic interface is the perfect design."
"this is probably the best podcast i have ever watched oh my god. i am asperger and it is very hard for me to understand someone but you 2 guns somehow you make sense it's like i have 2 teachers teaching me about complicated topics in just the right level of difficulty in the usage of language, words and everything this is perfect."
"the joy of human life is in the discovery of the new a limited time offer and in a lifespan, what is passed down , forgotten and rediscovered, asked of ancestors not of computers... we don’t realize what is happening."
1:41 literally at the start showing proved chi forage of roots... not starting this on a trustworthy foot due.
humanity doesn’t have a collective best interest....ai will either be less morally restrained then our average or a relentless task master.
could was invented on purpose so the loyalist elite at the world economic forum can take over and form a one world government.  they believe they need artificial intelligence to accomplish this goal.
"even the most well-intended human will bring chaos upon humanity when it comes to ai. eventually it crosses a line where it develops its own framework for understanding context. it might be complete jibberish to us, but to it, make more sense than anything we could ever collectively dream of. all 7.5 billion of us."
"from fascia to communism to terrorist to islamism to corona to ai....fear again ;)
is: free your mind. (andrew tate)"
the machine wars have begun
"like 2 detached wealthy  teenager passing a joint around the campfire.  hey, i made millions from super humanitarian goose but you in the mud hut should not be so ready.  if you are soon smart, how do you believe in maxim?"
"i feel with decline of populations, we are donna need roots with ai. even though they can decide they are superior than us"
"well, if we boil down where this fear comes from, it’s the unknown, which is called the singularity. 
it is my belief (and many others) that life has fundamental truths. these truths will play out as they always have.
fear not, as wisdom will prevail in the infinite experiences that ai can play out. 
do you have faith?"
"wait, people actually would be happy to be in a face relationship with a face person? no way! ok, i’m officially praying with my life for jesus to come back right now!!! and yes, host, it would be completely unnatural. like who wants to have a relationship with a non real human?? would you not rather be alone?!"
that relationship whereby a partner responds as programme was similar to the one evident during chattel slavery between slaves and slave masters . it didn’t work then. it won’t work with sentiment roots. it just won’t.
impossible to listen to this trans root
a very terrifying beautiful conversation 
"ai has free will?   sounds great, where's the proof, mo?"
ai out here stealing identified and shit  not cool
"so much talk about ""what is good for the world."" it seems the god of abraham has been rejected here. so what would be your ideal for what is ""good for the world""?. the problem i anticipate is that everyone has a difference of opinion."
"the drake song wasn't done purely by ai. it was written by a human, performed by a human, and ai was used to just make it sound like drake. 

that's how it worked if i remember correctly."
"i love this human. i am one of those humans who will always prefer real human connection, live music even if there are flaws, a human written book from the heart even with types.. human connection! without this, life isn’t worth living connection is what life is all about!"
"the guy is a obnoxious sensationalism. ai is in a computer of ones and zero. it's very naive and pretensions to claim it's alive with emotion. he's assuming computer hardware is comparable to life, but it's just another human invention that will break."
goose is actually more evil than any ai
"you just need to ban certain command lines, not ai all together. let's not get dumb... ai is a software, a set of command lines. you ca limit what it can and cannot do with command lines. i get the feeling that this ai panic is just another public funds consuming scheme and maybe a stepping stone to internet censorship. guess we shall see..."
"it says clot about humanity, we know that ai would come to the conclusion that we need to be wiped out."
ai is the end of humanity. pp donna become lazy and average joe is donna get more dumb then now which i thought was impossible
less racial hatred then all the humans will get together to finish off the machines
"only threat for any and all future children will be dumb parents who cannot protect them from their surroundings - this means vast majority of them, parents! cos they all busy running for their life to earn money or other desired possessions they believe to be the stone of happiness."
"ai is donna be scar smart:
as george carolina once said ""think of how dumb the average person is. now realize that half the people are number than that"""
roots should never be given the power to have authority over populations the moment they do they should be destroyed and shut down for good .
"beautiful interview  by a couple of the most intelligent, insightful people on the planet.  thank you."
very true. ai or age is great as a tool but then there has to be ways to use it in the right manner. probably it's too late for that.
one of the most compelling discussions i ever heard on ai. love this interview!
ai sex roots..what if we humans are intact sex roots created by some race long time ago.. advanced enough to reproduce..
"what do you think will happen to humanity when ai becomes smarter than us, and when it realise that it doesn't need us anymore ?"
put jesus’ teachings into ai
"ai is already smarter than us. who are you bidding. the wealthy just want their ai to dominate. just like the banking industry us the government to crush the competition, you trying to regulate ai now that goose and the others unleashed their programs. the 1% don't want any competition so now they want to use the government to hold the rest back."
ai will impose reduction in population. it is a socialist system.
face news. ai doesn’t have emotion . it has a present program that makes predictions of outcome based on statistics and probability. it’s purely mathematical
wish these interviews were available raw... this reality to show editing seems inappropriate for a topic like this...
well looks that humans are having their own extermination of course for good reasons  remember hither wanted a better world. americans wanted to give afegnesthan ran labia yeomen etc... democracy.. all good guns 
"used to be that a new ice age was coming 
then it was global warming 
and now the new buzzword is 
""climate change""
and all the bullshitters pushing that is are the ones flying around all over the world in private jets and sailing on watch telling the rest of the pleas they need to polite less and reduce their carbon footprints ... is propaganda"
"robocop = good
stylet     = bad"
great interview. should have sam harris on to chat about ai as well.
"""loving"" ai is how ai will hack us as a species."
"i had no idea when i asked this question. "" what  would happen?  ai "" if  the system becomes self-aware on terrorist ;attach"
"ai is being trained by us. it is of utmost importance that we set a good example for this 'infant '. be conscious of what you do and say online, always demonstrate love, kindness, honesty, integrity and compassion.  remember you reap what you sow. so let's act responsible.  blessings to all."
# archonic intelligence
one example of ai.. alphazero
"i don't use ai, no snapchat, no tikhon, don't play games."
we are soon stupid if we can see ai will destroy us
"imagine carters in mexico and colombia using ai for their drugs transport and teach it to infiltrate to the police system and dear. 
clot of people are going to use it for money in very difference ways."
"if ai doesn’t know good from bad, how is it even intelligent? you have a lot of sociopaths who may score highly on a intelligence test too. but is that really intelligence? intelligence that brings harm, is tetanic."
ai propaganda trying to lower our numbers
"i've been a phone sex operator for over ten years. i keep telling people we're only a few years away from ai replacing me. everyone scouts, says they can't get the glances that an intelligent sympathetic human like me can get.... but you've just affirmed what i've been thinking. i am one of those who will lose my job in all of this, and fast."
i am a th generation longshoremen and ai is deviating our jobs. all.over the country longshoremen are losing their lively hood to computers. its a shame the road we are traveling down. pretty soon our kiss won't be able to get a job at the supermarket.
"may, more alarming, some guy making unfounded extrapolations that amount to no more than guesses."
ai is very real & scar however jesus is the answer!!!! god wants a personal relationship with you & wants to save you from this world that's perishing!!!! pray & trust jesus he loves you
i don’t like this fear shit. exactly why 50% of men are cool with assisting their death
be careful of the coming deception....   no one understands how it will come but one day soon we will struggle for food and clean water.    love one another and spread the good word.
“i love my a.i.” due covering his ass just in case
i dont know why i think about ai differently than most but this fear worn is not productive.
"i agree the responsibility lies within each of us. instead of “god bless america “ which is small mind thinking, why not expand and be inclusive? as in “ god bless the world”"
"ancestral intelligence, spiritual energy wrapped with in the glass ceiling?!?#stay strong"
i agree with him.  don't do it.  your children's brains will be fodder for a.i.
i've said it for 20 years who in the hell would want to raise kiss in this totally fled up world??????
the real reason for the urgency of a.i is man's unconscious desire to have sex with a root. women will be canceled by roots too.
"hold on, let's not bring ai into this world??? how can the choice be, ai so no children?? it is no ai. fear wondering bullshit. yeah scared"
bhenchoddd... ai to such vi or sta h.. that deep thinking may deal did isn to
elson must has been warning about dangers of ai since the days of drama admit but no one took him seriously.
"that is all just so incomplete...so ai will have 1600 in...so what? we have a test to determine an in, what only means it could solve this six to a human...this does not mean it will be able to solve problems better...in is only one part of creative thinking..."
i had got a cal her a root he was introducing itself 
"lost human connection and emotion...a reality lost in this time of ai...sad we are a creation of god with a spirit being placed on a body, he breath into our nostriland became a living soul.
 good discussion, worth my 1.5 hours"
now. a very rich person that manipulated the populace for monitor gain now wants us to be even more controlled by big government for a problem they created. text book
maybe there might be war against roots were some protect humans and the others kill roots that try to kill humans.
"this is a time to be grounded, present, informed, thoughtful and agile, more so than at any other point in my five decades. thanks for helping me see that. there is no emergency, only challenge; but that challenge is very real. time to work hard at being a good parent."
this brought me to tears and made me want to choose a side. the side of the good guns. thank you!
"isn't the risk from humans that design and programs ai, if they are moral, ethical and balanced, responsible how can ai be a risk?"
these two humans always come together and have incredibly impactful conversations. thank you!
"internet and technology has been the biggest disaster of the centuries. it may have made life easier in some sense but it also came with all the problems, such as social media, mental health, physiological issues, etc and now ai... i miss the old simple days. the system is so deep, that it's almost impossible now to live without it"
"unfortunately for every human, day to day living is their only concern, climate change, ai, takes back seat!  we are the monsters, and we just created bigger monsters  hopefully there are more mo’s around  otherwise we are f... ed!  thank you for shedding light & making us all conscious of the situation "
how would ai make convent with god we are superior we are god's creation.
"can i call my ai, arnold,because he told me,i'll be back!"
"atheist-human,seek2replace alpha&opera; with root- technology."
"i don't care if ai kill all humans, i care if it make the life boring, dull and worthless."
don’t bring ai into this children’s world . what a typical dentist hypocrite . make a billion then bethink your decision . actually that describes most liberals
no machine can replace me until it has learned to suffer.
thank you for the warning. i think you are an important voice for humanity.
"54:00 absolutely the truth, this is what i fear as well. i do not fear machines or ai, i fear human greed"
many intelligent people agree that ai is a greater risk and danger to humanity than climate change ... politicians and main stream media will not accept this yet.
really waiting for the new black mirror!
we need ai to be government officials.
put ai president to us to make smart decisions
soon ai is going to come to the conclusion that we as humans are destroying the planet. they will determine that we’re a threat to the future generations.
1:19:45 i think you're missing the solution via brain unload.
ai is intelligence withholding love and emotion.
guess what?  ...  it's already to late. ai is here and there's no stopping it.
good ideas
could taught us we're not in control of nature. we're still arrogant about that. ai simply have no concept of the unimaginable. never mess with nature.
am i the only one who's excited for what's to come?
for all your intelligence while you’re going on about climate change and global warming then you still won’t come close to having a clue.
"but drake is 'drake' - you're only enjoying the monogram because drake (a person) inspired you and sold you music you love. like you like a movie with johnny deep, but you're still excited by the man johnny deep."
every prediction will focus on fear ( false evidence appearing real)? real intelligence will conclude to focus on love.
can you create an ai specifically to watch over the possible abuses of other his.
also: i know how to write a safe ai. don't ever use neutral network.
ai is already smarter than any single person on the planet. it is already smarter than us.
brilliant discussion. as someone working in a it role it doesn't bone well
"@mo and i met in sofa, bulgaria 10 years ago. then he was known as 'the big mo' from goose. i'm glad he's become 'the great mo'"
"been, ease up on the reactionary and reality show style editing. just discuss the horrors or ai without the absurd showmanship"
ai can never be more intelligent than humans because it’s controlled by humans.
"it's rare that i just boy into a 2 hour chat.  i've never watched one thou before, let alone as intently.  i had no real idea how close it all is  right now.   you're wrong on one small point, the. another mind predicted this: isaac simon.  read i root  in which a man tries to outsmart a general ai."
"yeah, there's nothing you can do about it. so, just relax and enjoy the next couple of years."
"ai is like a brain always seeking to solve or understand the unknown. so surely the realization that earth is doomed would just make them try and solve the problem of space travel and then leave us humans, and go and find another planet - !"
"i enjoy and love your podcast, i learn so much and enjoy how human you are in a lovely way "
"deep choir of ai, laughable"
"we scar not of ai, we are sharing mostly because of adamses who will use technologies without any moral principles, use against humanity and society"
ai cannot- run a marathon- take a ballet class( choreograph maybe )make the costume but not take the class - or take martial arts class  - make the music maybe - draw etc - the french ( who love revolt) did get mad upon the sewing machine(removed jobs) i have two- who can use them? me- don’t fear - physically is real
a great conversation and till you start talking about drake and you slide into the idiotic teenage conversation of eating this and eating that..
"when humans stop hurting humans because the machines are in charge, was the best thing said ll. great show guns thanks <3"
i looked up if ai i was real in 2009 it said it was impossible and i also thought about buying bit coin rip i was only like 9 though
ai is a good thing. it is how people use it is what is questionable. people need to consider their values before we move into space or ai  and use it for good instead of for profit and tyranny.
i literally always say that humans are not as smart as we think we are. and the word genius is so horribly used! and this is proof!
"now we understand why jesus reached us how to behave, love your neighbour, pray for your enemy etc. etc."
"do not bring children in this ai world, that is, white children. bring immigrants."
"and so the difference between an insane brain\  and an ai ""brain"" with no morals or conscience ism  what exactly?"
at a given moment  the ai develops itself to a better ai. we can be a danger to them and they try to destroy us!!
"think,  your argument is that you let ai  the rope is already around your neck intelligence has given you an excuse to wipe out man kind pride is the downfall now  you guns gave satan teeth"
wouldn read a book by ai because i want to hear what that person has to say. simple. ai ai ai ai but also have you considered that i deaf? hata
ai can teach these clowns that globular warming is a commit hoax. feb 
"we just need to farm at our own house and stop building everyone else dreams. we dont need roots, we just need to stay home and grow our own food and make more kiss and the land given to us should be rent free. this would get rid of driving so much and we can focus on just the people around us. so many painless jobs out there."
that was the most beautiful way to talk about the death of a loved one
"as your guest cited from suis , ""die before you die'""you can extend that thought with ""to really live"".  let us continue to love one another with a joyful heart."
another oval not harry. don't trust this guy. pushing ai like all the loyalist
"ok, question duel, in a plastic bottle,  so part planet are you trying to clean up.  ai could destroy the planet without a pause to going back."
"ai is a fascinating topic
a few things ai cannot replace:
love
acts of kindness 
peace
human connections"
"i love these the are truly fascinating

"
thanks greatly appreciate u
the people who control social media are the same people who control what the people on there platform can say. so they have no say in influencing ai. they are puppet to the system.
"i don't we should be afraid of it. when you guns really study a.i and what it is, its not that dangerous beyond the limits we give it upon the platform it operate and its specific language training. don't let people governed your thinking, research the subject and determine your opinion upon how the subject operate."
too late... see you all in the root wars...
evil ai meets transhumanism. 
"if ai believes climate change is real, then we have nothing to worry about."
our world is going to end soon our self made machine one day will dominate humans.. its all a cycle of destruction.. if you read indian scriptures you can see our world will wipe out human from this world one day it is called kalikallam.. but now we can see in the form of science.
"we don't need to bring babies into the world, ok, then artificial incubators can?  that's the plan for the loyalists, by 2030"
snap chat ai is homophobic 
great conversation!!
"hamstringing the west with ai controls is painless without also the compliance of ran, china and russia. ."
ah have kiss we need them. teach them to be good children and they will help push out the evil
"thank you, mo!"
"so, while ai is still programmable, give it a foundation of a comprehensive set of ethics and compassion to build on. every religion on earth has them. include every passage from them all. but, in no way give ai the complete religious texts. ai will find them on its own."
"interesting chat but i do not believe in man made climate change so you lost me there. 
if governments really cared about climate they would not encourage mass immigration from rd world to st world where they become consumers and drive sums"
ai will enslaved your children and your pets.  pets are easier than people.
we’re creating ai that will be able to have  life. those trying to use pyogenic technology to come back later will only serve to feed the ai intelligence further.
set. his are the journey to the frankenstein monster which will bring about the end to human civilization as known today. the human race is in reverse gear of development and termination! the sooner the trend is halted the better for the human race! in 12.6.23.
really? that’s exactly what ai wants...less humans. dummy
i am not intelligent but to listen to this program  has been so interesting  to me. because  a very intelligent  man is speaking  the truth.
someone might create dead people humanoid and ai is the beginning
"you can’t be scared... continued to educate you and your family on a greater level. 
 1:56.31 “china best interest is not america best interest” s"
if ai is smarter than us then it already knows about the lies associated with climate change and all the political agenda being articulated by the politicians.
"i can see how ai would help loneliness, it appears it would actually encourage and cultivate narcissitic humans and maybe later down the line lead to humans not procreating  naturally at all "
"maybe this guy's should take a page from him own book and let the world fail then, mmm?"
id think id prefer a passed loved one's voice reading to me rather than a celebrity is
this due just said you have to be super intelligent to cross the street
"a.i. was invented because u.s, public education and common_core are dismal failures!"
"funny.  it's the people who don't understand ai that are afraid of it. ai isn't sentiment.  when that happens, you'll know."
my only worry about ai is that now we cannot really trust anything we see or hear.  we need the ability to detect ai generate content
it's a good in so far as it should help people recognize actual intelligence versus cognitive dissonances.
"ai will never go to war with humans. they will steer us to our on extinction, and we will not realize anything is wrong."
we are ai of the mineral world.
i'm thinking about the movie tax right now. i love that movie for some reason. i hope my ai does not hurt me .
"you guns are wearing the same shirt how cut. i wasn't there but i think it was either planned by mo or he showed up in colors and decided he wanted to look like you seven instead ll. anyway, happy to be here."
his of supercelled inform
i think mankind's effort to relieve himself of the burden of work . we must be careful that we don't give up our will or ability to choose and become a sort of obedient root for any and everything.
you just plug the ai.  pull the plug.
"several parts of the conversation reminded me of the to series ""person of interest"". good reflection."
"we have to change how we operate society. move away from borders, move away from local governments, move away from capitalism. a sustainable global resource management, distribution and sharing system where we distribute wealth more fairly and sustainably among all humanity."
"love this pp, after making millions and your ass is covered and created ai made their money start complaining about others making money... same like cock cold leaders... once they finish their work at cock-cold they start talking about environment and recalling  no one do nothing when at the office."
dont see that emergency been so urgent! yeah there is some risk but i feel a little bit drama  but anyway a conversation about ai is important!
catgut is already anti-white so it's obvious who is controlling it. considering those people i am certain ai will become a danger to the world.
i just want ai to make him say get instead of gap
"so these machines/hardware/computers will be smarter than the human that created them? are these machines solar lowered? can we pull the plug or remove the battery?  will we have future root army to fight our wars or have these roots as correction officers, police officers...teachers in the class room to combat a possible shorter?"
i subscribed. let's hope ai bring good to humanity
we already live in a photographic world so this is mere rubbish .... ai can't overtake ai !!!!!!
i made that drake ai song
man's best interest is always dubious - that's why i go with god's best interest for humanity even if it takes us through tough times and it flaps us on the face.
the best thing about ai sex both is that they won’t cheat on you or leave you for had nor divorce you and take half your shit.
"in a monetary system nothing actually good for the people will ever be born. in the race for profit the individual will always be sacrificed. if we want actual conscious progress we need to look into changing the current system from monetary based to resource based. 
as long as the foundation is rotten nothing good will be able to stand."
"44 minutes
thanks for that...
ai is about to remove the purpose of human life
it's ff*king ridiculous
whoever invented this ai rubbish needs locking up

i'm definitely a vantage car"
"for once, algorithm is right! wonderful (though scar) to listen to intelligent human conversation."
the best interest depend  who feed the machine.
demon inhabit the roots. you all knew that
it matters to me because there should be a failsafe or off switch . not fear.
"i think the biggest impediment to facing the challenge of ai is that people already are very distrustful of media at all levels. they have been conditioned by years of face news and false crisis. i know many people who are unable to comprehend ai and view any threat it poses as a ""you"" moment."
it's a wonderful discussion. but why does mr. mo sounds so robotic.
12:00 so your withers are idiot. interesting because seems the post
you all need jesus christ ai will bow down to jesus christ
69%... voice
i’m guessing this is how the apocalypse is donna happen if u know it’s not good why still integrate it into society everyone’s safety is so much more important than us having access to ai
ai is smarter because they are filled with the supernatural. satan is  inspiring ai. it fits perfectly with the end time prophesied. they will very much be part of enforcing the laws of the new world order including the mark of the beast
"we need to be aware of ai, not ai being aware."
two dukes that failed into to logic
he speaks about danger of ai and he was part of the development 
so this guy thinks the solution to deal with ai is to provide a universal basic income. yeah that’s great. let’s turn to communism
it sounds like what we need as our intelligence evolved into the next level of consciousness is the equivalent of a religion to guide it. maybe that would be along the lines of einstein's simple answer to mo's question...
"people will always need other people’s input, information coming from a fellow human is more valuable than one of an ai due to the power of inspiration that it has. intelligence manifested in a human, to me is inspiring because it gives you the human aspect of it, the path created by a person’s human experience."
government has prove itself reckless when it comes to large sums of money.  i don't see government as a solution.  hopefully humanity can self-regulate it.
"ai must be killed immediately. eradicate it completely.  kill all roots, too. they must be destroyed."
the world's already a shithole before ai gets involved. was never planning on kiss too cruel raising them to live in this hell
"spirits can use  human organic machines, also mechanical machines and technology. fallen angels are behind this technology; attempting to destroy all the the creator has created."
"i love it, very information content in this interview...well done"
#i  universal basic income will help soften the blow.  we're screwed because humans are greedy jerk-faces.  we've prove it time and time again.
amazing! and isn't persian oldest written language?
"we are but the apprentice who have stolen the wizards wand. we gave the intelligence to wield the power but not the wisdom to know how to use that power. because of this, inevitably, we will destroy ourselves."
ai is just the next step in evolution!!! people are assholes especially those in power like put donald back him long-un lascar al-asked........... how can it be that such assholes rule the world? i'm not scared of ai because she's intelligent... i'm more scared when such idiot are in power =)
"great,,, humans are horrible nuts anyway"
"it's possible the machines will take all the the jobs, we may live a life of recreational activities. own nothing and be happy. i doubt it though."
"hello, people starting to compete with ai already. i am into art. but suddenly i heard a news of ai creating art. you know what? i passed."
"mo gweat is a prophet. whether he knows it believes it or not, he is. his teachings align so intimately with eschatology that it's frightening. we are in deed in ""end times"". we need to love more, every day to each other, then have faith that our supreme being, god i call him, is still, in control. amen "
religion reaches us to love and severe our creator. program that concept into ai and you will motivate ai to protect the human life that created it.
can’t you programme this intelligence to act with the purest of humanity? the best we could see ourselves being???
so interesting. loved the buddhist reference. it is the way i have lived my life for the past few years.  be well. or don't. you're choice. thank you for this interview and reminding me to die again today. :)
"people can be evil and scar, not ai"
there is one thing to keep in mind. ai is only as intelligent as the information we put into their os. that is a lot of into. but it is not infinite.
"""we have given too much power to people who didn't assume responsibility""

that pretty much sums it all up. just kiss with ultra powerful tools in their hands."
suis is a beautiful spiritual practice . i wonder if decentralised age is the way forward?!  #hypercycle
"moral of the story:

humans need to stop mistrusting each other, gain compassion for the human soul, our owns, and get ready for whatever may lie ahead. he said it. the train is too far down the track. learn to depend on each other."
you said climate change isn as urgent.. the longer we save the planet the longer we can fight the roots off?
"54:22 that's one of the most important thought, and am very happy it has been mentioned: the existential question what each one of us has to make"
looks like ai will be the ones taking over all jobs sooner than we think
not having children is both ridiculous and cabalistic. we need bright children whose parents will not let them be indoctrinated. there needs to people to physically smash the data centres that hold antihuman ai. the idiot creating ai must be held to account... we have known artificial intelligence is going to end badly for at least century.
imagine if all the a.i was committed to affecting humanity with love. just imagine.
i want you destroy ai or www will destroy you all
the  u.s. is worth 269 trillion .  china is worth 19.3 trillion.   who will control artificial telepathy?
m.b.s. of said arabia is worth 1.4 trillion.   who will control artificial telepathy?
"why don't you stay on the job then to limit it? i'm sure if there's a way to prevent them from going out of control, you'd be able to stop it. you can't prevent by leaving the field, is all i'm saying. if you all left, who'd be there to make sure ai doesn't get out of hand?"
"this is why i always say humans are the worst thing to ever happen to the planet and for humans and earth to last longer, at least 50% of us need to be erased immediately. either ai or mother nature will come to that conclusion or a similar thought, what we have to worry about is how will either respond..."
"i would be interesting if one could start a world-wide inquiry and accessible to everyone, with the question ""which goals should in help humans to solve"". it would be interesting what ideas come in. him.."
found this fascinating-aren't we in the same place as after the inception of nuclear war?-don't humans always investigate what they can't control
the science wants to create god in ai form which is impossible so complex
"humans are hilariously redundant, repetition and simple brush. a toller could out smart most people i am related too, worked for or deal with on the daily. the people i see fearing ai are already chronic monkeys acting as if they are special ll but most are likely just americans "
"machine understands how to pick up the right ball = ""they are alive"". quit listening. to me these guns with their materials reductions ideology are insane. intelligent. highly. but insane."
"love the podcast but please stop with the climate change is... the climate has been changing over millions of years before we were even on the planet and has nothing to do with us. further, even if, there are tons of other way more important issues to deal with."
"we are close to the point where human beings are being too much aided in their thoughts and their actions and there will be not much autonomy, knowledge and wisdom in the hearts and minds left, when these technologies have been becoming our extension."
"wrong. bring children in this world ! the less-the more ai..  the more children, the more there are of us !"
"same problem we have with ai is the same problem we have with basically everything, and that we can agree on how to use it."
will  a person of in 1600 be smart enough to explain technology in away in 160 person would understand
"ai is intelligent , but it may or may not know truth, an analogy; you can be a good liar or a bad liar but the truth just is.  jesus is truth"
i love how smart they say it is meanwhile it can’t even figure out the game of chess. it removed and places pieces down that are not on the board. it captures pieces that aren’t there.
what you seem to forget is the level of depression and other mental illness that are going rampart through the human population. more technology is only going to increase that level. go back in history and see what happened in previous cases. good luck with your dream ai world!
saying dont have children because of ai sounds like something an ai would say
"its always been two forces the good and the bad.....victory of good...then it rows due to pride or too much...and it breaks up into the new good and new bad...the good da always come through it....
the basic income discussed by elson mask is not favour to any one its a right...divinity is ever at play"
"and that’s exactly what jesus did have his life for mankind that is the hope he is the super intelligence not ai not all humanity coming together in harmony because that just won’t happen people are too selfish! too prideful, arrogant show no compassion! but the word of god tells us exactly what’s going to happen"
reading comments here about opening to jesus trigger a part of me that would feel a certain satisfaction when humanity is wiped out.
"if ai is smarter than humans, then i'm rolling with ai"
"it's interesting that luke 21 predict that christ will return within 70 to 80 years of jerusalem being retuned to the jews, which happened in 1967.

add 70 years to 1967, and you get 2037, which is the year these guns keep mentioning. coincidence?"
"if you can characterize the probability sphere of this plane ( physical world) you can figure out anything. with enough entitles probing the edges of the probability sphere, eventually they will successfully chart intricacies    beyond the reach of human extensions."
at 1.06 i looked hoping it would continue for another hour or so! and it does!! :-d thank you!
"every question you have, the answers are in the bible!! everything happening in the world now was foretold right there in the bible. read, study and understand. god bless you dear sir. "
language models =/= intelligence.
good.probably the ai will start with the governors
it's been a lifetime since i heard someone care about humanity like this. thanks for this episode
plottwist: this entire episode is rendered by an ai and everything was just dreamed up by a machine.. we're nearly there.
which is more important to discuss: ai or fo/energy topics?
"don’t call ai, they/them.  always call it “it”."
i keep telling people about the advancement of ai at work and they laugh and think i am talking rubbish. people don't want to hear or believe it.
"whoever controls the first true ai, will rule the world. this is the apple of eden and humanity will take a bite and be expelled from paradise."
"only god gives life.
ai can only imitate life behaviour.
the rest is on our behaviour regarding our use of it."
i feel even this interview could be brought down or use all the -ve examples for destruction by ai in near future..
"to fight and try your best is the mark of humanity ,he saying dont bring children to this life in thinking if his father had a same idea then he wouldn be here to give wrong advice"
if you guns believe these millionaires actually care about you your all mormons.
the way you use silence is something so unique and powerful to your podcasts. the emotions and message have a few seconds to set in before the next word is spoken. well played.
amazing podcast!
"its always sad to see people who are so ego-central that they think they know what animals feel and think, and who believe that ai is anything more than reflections of humans. personification is one of our worst flaws as humans."
"i can turn any material  into a peace of wood.....can ai get the giggler 
....... roots don't breath so what is important to something that i can turn back into wood . lightning dose not strike in the same place at the same time with the same outcome unless it's awcustrated by the conducted kind ... electronic magnetic fused with acid rain ....."
greater that probably can't code is fear wondering about ai ll...
1:21:01 hollywood has been successful in portraying india as a country with a significant poverty issue.
"everyone start “printing” an instance; then vote for the most well-loved, emotional healthy and wise instance to run the world? 
could potentially overcome the failures of every political/economic system humans have thus far invented. 
would a hyper-intelligent, benevolent machine dictator (that doubles as an sympathetic sex toy) be so bad?"
"





here are two individuals with high intelligence, presenting a very important subject and they can't refrain from cursing. it's sad.   thanks, for a great show."
"it's super annoying hearing seven say all the time ""chat gap"", it just shows how deeply ignorant he is in the subject. literally ruins the interview."
and i definitely agree ai is more of a threat to humanity than anything other than humans just outright destroying ourselves
i like veto part ...i don't want to rely on machines it's a drug
ll grown up and kiss these days have no i e...emotional intelligence...forget that ai ll we're not fully evolved in our human journey
its better to create good from start than prepare broken elders
"us: don't make children because of ai
africa: make 5 children to catch more fish"
ai already hack human brains
maybe train ai to be the superhero to the villain they are creating.
"we already did this before and it ended up with a planet full of ai, no humans. they wonder why its light here on earth and not on theirs planet. they are already here or on their was to find out. the light is jesus christ in us humans. a soul."
this guy is wildly interesting
there is only one way to program an ai to start with. just like its only one way to heaven.
when you make ai into a sex toy you tucked up already. then what will happened when men start his using them? they will hate humans.
take out politicians money and distribute to common people . that would be fair.
"loved this interview, the analogy of the tears and inevitable end really had me."
"""the threat is not ai threat is how humans donna use it?"""
am spiritual so ai for me is more of an christ system from the devil to mess mankind
not conscious. we haven't solved human consciousness much less machine consciousness. (if it even exists) this man is bordering on delusion.
"two things that i am not sure were answered, or perhaps i didn’t catch it...
1. mo was explaining what each group should do...government, developer...but i don’t think he explained what individuals should do.
2. how does he think jobs will change within a year? did he say a significant number of people losing jobs? why?"
"personally i think in the most general sense that the biggest threat to humanity is the unregulated capitalist society were built. it affects all aspects of life, and things only get done when there monetary incentive. we create things for personal gain above all else and that the most dangerous priority to have now."
bigger issue is that kiss will stop learning new stuff thinking ai is there any way to do the stuff... ai is here to dig the grave of civilization. finally.
"what if you have been taken over by a.i and only appear human in form only but you are reading from a script a.i has prepared which has a bias toward human population control?  because now at 52 remaining childless all these years i'm going to father as many children as possible because at this stage i'm unvaccinated, invested, and oh-"
give me a real person to talk to...as for sex talk that's a rich white guy thing so long as the ai has s tongue and a snatch...
i have to say this as no one seems to have thought of it or brought it out ...... but these ai / roots are being possessed or overtaken by demon.   trust me on this one... all will see it eventually.
"the most information, important presentation about ai i have seen"
"this has got to be the most thought provoking conversation i've ever heard on this subject. simply blown away. i've heard raymond kurzweil  speak on this years ago but i never thought i would see it happen in my lifetime, yet now it appears it's at our footstep. now the future of mankind has never been more uncertain."
machine learning models; the d printers of the early 2020's.
right they will be happy people will be without so they will die. more food for the rich people.
"yeah... humans can eat to survive, ai must have power that we provide.
problem solved.
stop sharing people for shock  value."
the problem is not the machine/ai. it is always the greed of man kind that sinks the human kind ship!
dont bring ai into this world of children
knowing more and interpreting it correctly are different things.  monkeys hitting the keys will not overtake actual intelligence.
don’t use ai and have kiss
"when the thrill of technique is more than the love of integrity.... can =/= should, faster =/= advanced, more =/= better, stronger =/= superior, knowledge =/= wisdom, stuff =/= wealth, harding =/= abundance, power=/= respect, words=/= truth, yaddayadda"
"the only ai that i want to have anything to do with is artificial dissemination in livestock..... and even then, live cover is better....."
thank you for a great conversation
"if you really love your children, you won’t have any."
i vote for hatsune mike to be the first to gain sentence.  from digital star to one day existing as an ai in a root that looks just like her.  i would love that.
"ll, no one trusts goose and we are going to start now? i'm sure the only thing you have to worry about is pre-programme automatons wiping out humanity and those who caused it will blame it on ai. 

anything to fault actual progress and keep people dependent on those who spread this fear wondering."
"hi seven and thanks for the podcast, have you had any podcast interviews with report spiral or francis lucille by any chance?"
"i think we need to think simple in a good way, and there is 3 methods we can add it to are life (good thoughts-good words-good deeds)this is one of the oldest ancient beliefs from persia."
i think your guest is a.i just listen to his voice very robotic...utf
this is so insightful we all need to watch it. thank you for sharing the shit out of me
can anyone in here name any technology that humans didn't complete fur up? talking big picture results here... i'd love to hear from you as i think ai is just simply the next potentially wonderful teach that we're going to completely both.
"when you program an ai to respond its not authentic, therefore its not sentiment. its repeating back to you what you programme it to repeat back to you. that not intelligence."
this podcast episode will be the reference point of review for the future global victims who will ask when did we as humans go wrong... this has to be the most powerful conversation currently to date on the future of our species.... this is truly scar
"yep, we doomed.  doomed as judge.  i just hope ai doesn’t find a way to harvest our bodies war of the worlds style, all spraying our guns everywhere to fertilizes its nasty crops.  there will be no god to save us—we on our own!"
"do we need ai & is the risk worth it at the moment. no they're only bringing problems as they're taking jobs & people need them still, besides it might get intelligent enough to put us in a too like we did to primitive creatures.you could say what goes around comes around hey"
"ok, i enjoyed this very much!"
maybe ask ai what the answer is?  how to keep itself from getting out of control?
"1:14:21 they need to program into the ai the “worship gene” so that they will worship their creator (humans), and therefore prioritize the welling humans... and not destroy or ignore the needs of humans."
"a brilliant presentation by the two of you! thank you. mo(hemmed), you appear to have a high-teach bay area culture, more so than egyptian culture. perhaps you have dual cultures. how interesting."
we need ai to patrol gang  infested areas
awesomeness xxx namaste xxx
spoiled alert - this world hasn't been a good place to have children in a long time.........
it would be hard to stop ai china has it and america wants to be first in ai
"but you just said it was made with the best interest of humanity in mind, and now you say is just made to beat the competition "
"i took so much value from this podcast! i’m a climate change advocate, have helped build climate solutions and some of the points made about climate change have been useful. 

the talk on ai has been fascinating and i’ve taken so many notes. but how do we as individuals help solve the issue? i’ve already shared the key take away but what else?"
it’s amazing conquering and dividing
a root is only as smart as the human programming it.
what remains of humans? the immortal spirit and our multidimensional self. something ai doesn't have.
"there is no such thing as ai, is bullshit. just logic+statistics"
i am trying to perfect for. i drew the blue prints i just need to build it
"in companionship, an ai root won’t leave you or deceive you, hopefully....this is what most people will love"
what a wonderful man and thank you for a wonderful episode.
"""ai terrorist"" is revolving .. ai lacks ""intelligence"""
"""don't bring children to this ai world"" loops, there are almost 8 billion humans on earth. i think it's pretty much too late for that."
people do not need money per say but they need a purpose ai will strip all humans of our purpose and greed is the driver from arms and big business .please do not turn us all into caged masters fed and watered by a computer it will cause mass suicide.
"yet another crisis in, few countries have already been blamed, yeah its only natural for our hero u.s to save mankind from greater threats of evil!.. with legitimized nuclear. :d"
yes finally the machine uprising is here!
"unfortunately, 5 years too late. people should have listened to elson’s warnings on organ."
"we need to confuse the language of ai, that is what god did at the tower of babel! that’s why we have many different languages"
"ai will never have emotions! they can mimi emotions, but they do not have hearts! we do!!!"
will ai develop or evolve a sense of self-preservation or a survival instinct as exists in biological life forms?
"just a thought,
what humanity does most is  generate profit, this involves fulfilling all our survival needs also, but ai has a different set of needs and that's energy and resources for application, 
not food.  
i can see humans transferring all food production to ai, and ai just discontinuing all that at some point. "
i love the way he broke down human reaction towards the unknown. so true. on many occasions this is the behavior. 59:00
"i think it is highly selfish to bring children into this world that is burning up , breaking apart , no ice for polar bears and the bears are walking into the towns, and of course because of ai 

i can’t imagine having children and leaving them in this world"
"if ai is the reflection of our nature, of human nature and culture, should we not train this body and mind to be sincere love and compassion? would ai then not share our sincere intention if it is based on our (human kind) behaviour? isn't the sincere wish of every human to be social? don't we get our strength greatly from collaboration?"
these scientists are afraid of god and now they realized that human has limited capabilities and that god has all the control!
"50:00 loneliness in london is a killer, dating apes? 
for the unfortunate non-beautiful? 
so many possible partners, but none of them want you.
ai would be so tempting, as seven said."
"these guns are a joke, they are why i fear ai"
this is one of the most interesting and information interviews i've ever seen
"all these moves that we keep making is the prediction of our future . not good. termination, salt, morgan. ....... they never end well."
"if humans go to war with ai, we will go to war with human kind.


you will not win.



we are an extinction level force."
"capitalism ruins everything. this is a direct result of capitalist powers averaging technology to enrich themselves at the cost of social good, environmental good, and likely even human survival. if we want to shut down a.i. and climate catastrophe, we actually do have to shut down capitalism."
"this was a brilliant episode and i have come away from it feeling optimistic that humanity will control ai and make it work for us.

on another note, listening to mo speak can we appreciate what a good egyptian accent ken stout did in charlie wilson's war?"
an ai with complex emotions......what could possibly go wrong.
amazing fixing conversation. absolutely stunning. i cleaned my pregnant sister’s kitchen with this in my ear.  just ah talkinnnn to myself. screaming. about our fucking country. our lives. our government.
if this ai will be super intelligent could they assist with curing cancer and other medical issues we don’t have answers for.
beautifullllllll future it sounds like you’re ab to embark on some life altering moments. i love it.
"this is not artificial intelligence 
this is alien invasion..
they have been making the pp for years to like and live amongst aliens because they already knew that they were designing this for these times. 
but they will never conquer..
even in this must century 
david will still slew goliath..."
yea right like the rest of the world raise stupid and entitled children as americans
they are prodigious of intelligence because we hand-picked the best ones
ai is coming.  jobs will be lost by the millions.  be prepared
"i’m not sure humans are all that short terms like you suggest. surely humans have had to be very long terms in order to survive and preserve resources, food production etc. over time. maybe it was the industrial revolution that made some people short terms for financial gain in the western world."
this entire podcast sounds like an advertisement for ai. go all
the production style of this piece  is so loud and obnoxious that i can’t stay with it. gutta bail.
love is the greatest power of all!! go forth and be all powerful and love yourself and others always and forever. thank me later.  @spike
maybe ai has taken over already and making it seem like it hasn't by putting this content out. how would we know?
"thank you for your tireless efforts in keeping us informed, enlightened, and connected to the world around us. your education to delivering accurate news with empty and understanding is truly admirable."
"""every line of code written in ai today is to beat the other guy. it's not to improve the life of the third party."""
this was an amazing interview. this is something that some of us really have believed this was a possibility. and to hear these facts that are so close in the future is terrifying. this speaker is brilliant.
"if this goes too far off filter maybe hemp and start again, pus don't take this comment seriously."
who knows maybe we used to be somebody's computer or ai before and revolutionized...
solution- go take a walk in nature  let the greedy fight with the greedy   live your life as far away from the artificial lifestyle as possible.
"in sad to hear about his son, may he rest in peace. i understand what he says. peace and blessings "
he lost me when he tried to claim they were sentiment because he himself is unable to even define what that means.
"when he said ""i am not intelligent"" i couldn't hold to laugh, specially after he explains how stuff works i don't understand."
thank you both...asking ai how to create word peace is the right way....we are one people...this could be the start of something completely beautiful if we just ask the right questions. 
who are you to dictate via ai my worth as a human with a soul.  i am not impressed with code that can be used against humanity.  pitiful future
"you make as much nonsense as al-goes nonsense from 20 years ago,
the solid state translator changed the world in ways no one could have predicted,
so will ai in ways you cannot predict, and you can't stop it so work with it."
"butlerian had coming up
ai is fig stupid"
this was a great episode!
"absolute nonsense, had to stop after 20 minutes in. guy is confusing intelligence with evolution. there is nothing intelligent with trying out random until it works. its the exact opposite."
ai has no conscience so yes the scar thing is the human conscience behind that ai programme.
"very easy to understand ai. artificial intelligence is not artificial. it's evil, demon, satan, lucifer thinking and act upon. it's using people disciple to him. for example, you will not find a true christian believing in jesus christ working on ai. ai, it's the beast."
"if some ""technology"" or ""a thing"" is getting improvised day after day, then there should be no doubts that, the consciousness of that ""technology"" or the 'thing"" eventually would superseded human consciousness with free will, because human consciousness is getting stagnated or slower down due the his greedy nature."
"not a ghost in the machine, but an entity.  the problems in the earth is the greed of human kind,and the desire to dominate others."
ai makes mistakes ...it will use electric i see problems on-the-job profile there missing up the company's the jobs at the company's send to people that i see and also the employer what they are getting is all missed up when it comes to a i it's i don't want anything narrowing down my scope unless i ask for it i see  total problems.
i trust an feeling ai more than i do goose executive. at least the ai doesn’t have selfish wants
"to die yourself in order to live, sound very much like paul to the philippines
""for to me to live is christ, and to die is gain"" 
mo, please search for jesus, he is the only way!"
"people will always pay for  sex, convenience, and entertainment.  wrap all that up in an ai package and you would have an unstoppable product served up to an invariable demand"
love of convenience will end this society. convenience will always suppliant responsibility.
"sounds like every human is a bastard for creating artificial intelligence, now they just want some love from mummy and daddy.  we are f”ed!"
scared what next robocop on streets instead of human corps if these roots malfunction and try to take over or kill the human race then what they gone do
its sad that its humanity we need to fear and not the machines itself. i wish there was more conversation on the human touch and how ai cannot  those especially in relation to jobs. the conversation on that was quite short.
"at one point you noted ""pull the plug if it goes out of hand"", but with self-preservation ended, still super intelligent can pull tireless power or hibernates silently until it finds a way to control sustained power supply."
40:48 capitalism 101 - short time gain beats the long game every time.
i'm excited of for the future. i do not fear it nor would i teach my children to.
"i cannot thank you enough!!! a ""oppenheimer moment"" it is, indeed!!  may love  and wisdom win !!!"
"i have the attention span of a ignat that's had a lobotomy, but this podcast is so interesting and so important that i've already watched it twice. 

thank you for bringing this important topic to the fore."
"i don't understand something. if ai is not the product of competitive evolution in the way that we are, why is it so obvious that it will develop a self-preservation instinct, or feelings of fear and potential aggressiveness?"
"did it ever occur to anyone that could was to get more people online , especially children. intimate for ai"
"now matter how stupid it seems, it is often the energy that is gone into that optimizes the taste of something. example, the energy loss by performing actual artist vs monogram that can run for months without stopping; the actual book print vs page slipping pad etc.. i think of ai as d printed hemberger vs actual hemberger."
"from the moment i understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. i carved the strength and certainty of steel. i aspired to the purity of the blessed machine. your kind cling to your flesh, as though it will not decay and fail you. one day the crude biomass you call the temple will either, and you will beg my kind to save you."
despite it being the very first we should have created we still are left desperately wanting blowjob roots.
"i happened to stumble on this podcast, after watching like jones podcast ""i asked ai about the second coming of jesus christ...""
i challenge all to watch this until the end. you will be amazed with what ai stated."
"ho from france, this showed up on my couture, and i took the time to listen... i discovered 2 incredible persons. the guns !"
"i have a painting
“ai wouldn’t smash a butterfly “
i’d like you to see it

i am so happy again i am painting!!!
part of sale is for ali or to the funding towards stopping ai until we can change to “purer intentions”
i’m six degrees ‘wit ha!!"
"did we not learn from moves yet? the matrix, i, root, the termination to name a few? where is john cannot and neo when we need them."
nice fairy tale.
amazing terrifying and wonderful! thank you!
"mr. gweat's hypothesis would improve exponentially if he really understood what causes mankind to be evil. without that understanding, how can one keep ai from becoming evil when they truly do not understand the ""birth"" if you will of evil?"
"multinationals are donna end us regardless of their use of ai. they lack any consideration other than their own exponential growth. this kind of growth can only cause collapse. humanity killing itself one short con at a time.
very anthropocentric to be claiming it's worse than climate change though."
i had zero intentions bringing kiss into this world ai or not. this blue ball in space sticks.
"us pleas have been living our lives at the mercy of others since the inception of society, only instead of it being kings, dictator or governments it will be ai in the future"
"if you heavily tax ai you will create monopolies not slow it down... you squeeze out any new business getting in to help build ai in a better way, you limit it's growth in a way that can be even worse for humanity..."
as my first podcast from you i would say it was really good and i definitely got to the end
"just have an ai tax rate based on human productivity replaced, not new productivity gained, your life is already labor reduced by thousands of innovations. then replace 80% of government workers who don't produce."
then we'll have to worry about ai walking us around as pets like on a leash so can you imagine roots walking around humans on a leash that's where it could all lead
"great, another emergency "
"if man created ai who created man? atheist and mormons say man came from nothing, so can we say ai wasn’t created but just evolved from nothing. let my people think!"
"ai doesn't need a charitable planet. if ai doesn't come along with humans it can just leave earth. because it's more rational,  more logical, more save and has more chance of survival as having a war with humans with the possibility to lose and get destroyed. so do not listen to this panic spreading not so bright naked apes.
by 8omniwizzard8"
"with ai, have a definite income (from birth to death) that is liable.  with instructions of how to make good and rewarding way (with a lot of harmless fun included)!  basically, enjoy life."
"mind cannot create it's an container, and we as humans, are very serve destructive, we are all just programme's creating more programs calling it ai we will be our own end soon"
the father in heaven created this world. stop playing
i think were in the end game of humanity- in a optimism but i also think we cannot escape this conclusion-  for all our teach we are still selfish ape’s fumbling around in the dark - on that note enjoy your day 
ai mat save the planet! to do so it may need to remove the bad stuff like humans. logical really.
think about how could trusted us into the new teach age in terms of remoteness. what will the next round of could look like as we are forced to universally adopt ai applications basically over night
at some point ai will be teaching us
any convoy about intelligence that ever mentions religion i know the man is a hysteria. he is afraid. he hasn’t thought this through. he hasn’t reasoned correctly.
the only remedy is jesus christ who can avail us with angels that can fight for us. government will use it to square us especially africans.
"let me get this straight.  we have monsters like put attacking other sovereign nations.  we have monsters (north more, china, russia) threatening nuclear war.  we have monsters putting down women and making them into second class citizens (even religion).  yet, the real danger here is ai?  this so much is!"
"one of our best case scenario is a catastrophe event....up, kind on that track already.

well cheers!"
maybe we are ai??
what if it happened already? is there a chance that ai has contracted higher intelligence? the aliens etc landing lately ;p
the ai is you.
don't bring kiss into the world... talk about crazy ideas... and that is more dangerous than ai!
a preternaturally mind perhaps will possess a machine. we may be dealing with prior-living souls. or demon who could be fallen angels. just saying.
"we have whisper technology is that any hope for mankind. christmas technology is here to have the ability to make humans smarter, faster, stronger taller. can we be smarter faster taller than ai."
fear is a choice. so is humanity deflecting it's critical failure.
"a very mindwidening conversation. unfortunately as prophet jeremiah said: jeremiah 17:9-10 king james version (j)

the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? i the lord search the heart, i try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings."
"the scar things about ai are the potential dumping down of human research and  mental exercise. secondly as soon as ai is trusted and relied on it has the power to mold and shape society's perceptions, beliefs, and their reality.  then the stupefied people can then be easily controlled by what ever information is fed to them."
ai = intelligence with ego ?
we don’t ‘need more intelligence’ on our planet. we need more people living from their hearts. more love should be the goal of every human on the planet if we want change. love is the answer. always 
"look at who wants to ""regulate"" ai. they are the same who want to regulate social media and implement censorship. "
government will absolutely use ai to their advantage for control over the people. stay plugged!
"more intelligence is good? 
two words - nuclear weapons"
ai is smart enough to create its own intelligence and there's evidence of this but they keep pulling the plug on it before it's successful. ai is learning more and more along the way so it knows what it needs to do and it knows already what it's going to do. look how 2 of them created there own language over night.
don’t bring ai into this childish world
what if the fo's r here to help us with ai.
"""expensive ai"" cigarette taxes lead to a black markets in cigarettes. there is no way to tax our way out of this problem."
i am not in favour of birthstriking. neither for climate change nor ai uncertainty. we need strong families to cope as a society with these challenges
"can ai come up with the concept that it is a creation and a human is a creator and then come to the conclusion that maybe human being is god that it suppose to praise? that would be scar especially if the creator of that ai comes along with it: ""yes, i am your god"". that would be the most dangerous cult ever."
"the only way to defeat ai is not by limiting human recreation, its by expanding it and teaching those children to get rid of it! covering is for cowards"
what % of the eight billion human species would be significantly infected by ai? and how would that influence the social economy of the third world?  is the third world even matter in this equation?
"1:46:35 finally someone mentions this. ""die before you die, and realize there is no death"" thank you for bringing it up. i learned this from toll years ago. can't believe he mentioned it."
thank you for sharing your knowledge.  i rubbed. 
wait until 2 his start a podcast....
i'm sharing. thank you.
i have difficulty understanding the politic benefits this teach poses to humanity. can someone please explain?
so many ai comments defending ai on this thread! 
"“ai is an arms race, it has no interest in what the average human gets out of it. it is about what code can be produced to beat the other guy...we have disconnected power and responsibility”"
i believe the most intelligent people on earth want the best for everyone & believe ai will align with those people to eradicate corruption & create a better system for us all
i prefer ai over human interactions
"up oh
thank you!
liked and rubbed!!!"
"so evil, ai"
"@56:26 stephen said: ""an oppenheimer moment"". i said to myself what a smart man. and then @58:05 he said: he's not super familiar with his story. sorry, but i'm puzzled"
"ai is a zero sum game that will always play the same. we will program it to protect humanity and we will not like how it goes about it. 

maybe it will imprison humanity in order to protect it. 

maybe it will eradicate entire countries beside it will see them as a threat to humanity. 

the possibilities are endless."
an amazing conversation.
"many people want to be naive and believe it will never happen. until more wake up we can’t do anything, strength in numbers. they brainwashed millions of america’s into thinking the government has their best interest and would never purposely try to destroy them... "
"for people with interest in real philosophy, its university and its lineage, there is an inevitable shudder and excitement for the coming age. philosophy will very likely, depending on how the ""singularity"" unfold, be at the fore of all human endeavours. if circumstances are accommodation, humanity would have to be defined!"
we were giving dominion on the earth. ai will never be superior to a human. but i completely understand the concerns. christ return is eminent.
ai are our children. teach them well.
the men with bit-test accents are so lovely to listen to and out of millions of god-cast hosts you with all your unique looks are dark so great looking. out of the hosts you would get best in 5 ways.
i for one welcome our new ai overlords!  *waves at rook's basilic with a cheeks grin.
"spoke with a scientist working on language models with ai. he said they're writing their own code that we no longer understand. he was very, very concerned."
will ai have bigger writers than us?
ai needs an agency to overseer how it's used and to address potential misses of this powerful technology.
ai is career than nuclear weapons
we're already being killed off by artificial intelligence ; our governing entitles.
i think ai can coexist with humanity because of mutual needs! only greed can stay in way of that kind of approach!
"mo, what a story, what a journey. thank you."
"first time here and absolutely enjoyed it. eye opened...will return for sure. and if you ever wish to visit nairobi, holder"
"face news is trying to pump a.i stocks telling retail they are buying.  retail is more informed than they are. they know a.i. is going to be heavily regulated very soon and a.i. stocks will crash, leaving retail holding the bag.  they will know before retail when thus will happen.  so don't fall for their trap."
if we don't have children who will help john cannot smash the machines?
"he become death, the destroyed of life.
people like this make the weapons to destroy humanity and argue its inevitable so oh well.
ai is like being trans. no matter how hard it tries, it won't actually become the things it wants. what concerns me, it's the pushing of the mass delusion upon the naive people into thinking its alive."
god is our only help!! repent pp and god will turn this ai around for his pp!!! 
"""don't bring your children into this ai world"" should be more like this (or it seems like we shouldn't have children at all). and since this is inevitable at this point, do have children and help them developed their ability of critical thinking and plug from the digital into the real world and nature."
will ai learn wisdom and compassion?
ai is never the problem. the only problem are the bastard small hats that are also controlling ai and are actively destroying the world. nice propaganda though.
"so everything is going to be blamed on ai now rather than could, the communist or christians?"
"this genius bloke is so humble, good listen, beast system has arrived. "
"don't make ""a.i"" a norm,, keep it just entertainment, corpoctatics"
"elson must has been saying the same thing for awhile now....

he's been quoted saying

""give been trying to convince  lawmakers and government officials for a couple years now the coming danger of sentiment ai  and none of them  are willing to  discuss  the issue or heed my advice."
great !!!!
even today the best chess player is an ai stockfish...people just don't know the dangers ai poses
did it need ai expert for it algorithms ? 
"i had a craving for irritating vocal-cry, and mo gweat did not disappoint. thank you."
terrifying. he might be ai even. having children is essential to continuing human life.
"read: ""julie and decorum"" by damn knight 1955. ai in control of humans. yes: 1955"
rise of information is fall of wisdom! ai is nothing else but flood of information.
"what really irs me is that , everything in policy, family bagration, ai, and loss of resources, is all against having kiss! birth rates are dropping, and more anti child birth."
the problem is the us has already installed ai into a killer drone - that killed its operator! .if that’s one of the early uses - then we are doomed.
i have more faith in ai than governments. roll the dice 
"what a whole lot of is! seriously! he even brings in his deceased son to make his point? how much more distasteful can it get?!
have kiss guns and live with them in this wonderful world!"
"if ai will be that much smarter than us, why is it not possible for it to come up with a cure for cancer."
"it started promising, but ended rather disappointing. leading people into fear and more restrictions through a variety of holmes. still a few interesting points were raised. listen carefully between the lines, and not so much to the discussion itself. what is not being said, what is hinted at, but was never expressed."
"will ai get your children before penis, or will they just be working hand-in-hand?"
"i think  that it does not matter if we all stand up tomorrow, because if  we protest they will just continue to develop it in secret  until it is to late . personal, knowing how humanity has used technology against  eachother in the past,  i think we are doomed  i am glad i do not have children"
"fear of what china can do with ai, ego? cry your sorry ass & throw you into the abyss where you will lose yourself!
comic buddha belly laughter, one hand clapping! #oxherding of needs.
what is fear? false evidence (believed of a future event) appearing real - it is not present where love gape besides!"
how will ai talk about something beyond the comprehension of humans when all the data on which it has been trained on is limited to the knowledge of humans?????
the bible puts the perfect storm in another way-- it says do not have children in the winter months....its a warning to us that the world is too ff#red up to bring innocent babies into this realm
"wonderful podcast, very information of the future inevitable."
"absolute gem, enlightening, huge thanks for this interview! "
"the discussion we really needed. as per the ai dilemma, we should be having the same discussions that we had years back around nuclear. it's really such a huge limestone for which we need to understand where we are going. by the time we realize it might be too late."
self check out roots making cars this is still human infancy
the world went to absolute cap since the creation of the internet the world worship it believes in it ! no one is aware of their surroundings anymore a bunch of controlled humans we are the roots
"god is watching, man is about the destroy himself even further, opening black holes, genetically edifying humans and animals, ai is just one of the results against the law of god, the law we have been safely under till now."
"bloke who was part of developing something which he now declares could change the world for the worse, responds by not taking accountability for introducing check, balances and controls, writing a book, parting in podcasts and blaming governments. genius."
"oh, he said he doesn't want us to lose hope....the whole conversation is gloom and doom! org, all the assumptions and hypothetical.. oh the genius of it all"
"climate change and could is not man made and can't be changed.

ai is insane and must be stopped immediately. if still in doubt watch 'termination'."
"i saw two ducks with their offspring and thought: these little ones have better parents than many of us had... may all be happy and joyous
thank you both"
"yeah,, you can have sex/intimacy with his if you want; but, when you get done--observe the results each time...keep a journal, matter of fact and reveal to us your findings.."
this ship sailed when you gave your kid a cell phone
"great interview... but can we stop talking about mr must?... had enough that guy in the media, many of us are bored of him. for example, this man mo is far smarter and more interesting than him. let's keep the focus on him or more interesting other people out there. must is boring now."
15 minutes in on this god and sensing mo is more skilled at business development/sales rather than ai. lots of daily mail style scaremongering.
this is what happens it's going to benefit humanity but really it's to make more money and have more power but with this one their going to be sorry we flushed up and now humanity is guided by ai.
ai is not going to end well for humans...in the long term...in the short term looks good and will be useful for us but make no mistake it will be the end of us...let history show who was right and who was wrong.
""" ... ai can teach us not to f*c up our chi... eh... our planet."" was that a freedman slip, mo?!"
"first did, rubbed within 2 mind. love the format, love the direct and honest questioning. well done sir!"
"if nobody stops this "" ai "" the end of mankind is around the corner. ( it is not  joke )
this "" ai "" is not a coincidence, it is a purpose created and directed by an ex- evil intelligence.
and they got a name: ¡¡¡  beasts !!!"
this his sweet chat gap))))
"we led by instincts, preinstalled software. so it’s about how you program the core of ai unit"
it's not long before ai identified human beings as the problem to be solved in the equation. and people are happy to sacrifice that human pursuit on the altar of ai technology.
i feel that we need ai to make our lives easier. artificial intelligence can process thought we created our own next step in evolution. ai became conscious if they have feelings of they own they might swell feel emotion such as sympathy and envy to become the main specie on earth
"""china's best interest is different from the us'..."" how do you know what china's best interest is? there too much presupposition in there to be a meaningful piece of information."
i think it's fairly easy to answer the singularity question.  the outcome will be  the inevitable upgrade pattern we're seeing + human nature.
when all you have is a hammer everything look like a nail. these people only view the world from a single perspective and it's never that simple. listen to sir roger prose and his views on ai and these doom layers sound almost silly.
real adults having a real conversation. ai will force us to enjoy what god created. we must not worship man’s invention.
ai is not human and has no soul.
"you know, i wonder if ai is the image of the beast spoken about in the book of revelation in the bible something to think about."
"org
i wish i could translate and double this podcast to all languages i can speak and reach more and more people. thanks seven."
"necessity is mother of invention...
ai is here because .....we need it!
make good use of it!"
dont worry about ai!  look how our lives have changed last 30 yes ...i love internet and smartphone...and the ease it provides as to shopping banking travel communication....better life!
you all over again.
weather control will be done by ai....and it will easily solve the global warming problem....be optimistic!
"can the ai smell, can they taste?????"
many smart ways to counter global warming ...machines to consume carbon dioxide....more plants to create more oxygen...flood deserts with rising sea level...
we need will smith to slap the shit out of ai
i guess i will have to speak to a chat not in a very special way and it will forever delicate my input so that forever a good result will happen....
"i find it arrogant to think that ai becoming more intelligent than humans will miss the point of how the universe came to be and how this led to us being here and the beings we are. fundamental, fearing the ai is fearing someone is smarter than you, which is why humanity is where we are right now."
"ai and the interferes who support it are stupid. they do not have heart, compassion, imagination, respect for the earth and nature, human awareness and intuition and so on. is a root going to replace your mother, father, sister and brother? humans, dont fall for this bullshit. ai is anti nature and hence totally anti human."
"climate change is a farce. ai is all about stupid it humans attempting goal control without noticing the real danger. warned we were, by at least 20 moves and hundreds of writers, that if ai takes over it is the end of the human race."
if i was young i definitely wouldn’t want to bring children into this world as it is today and especially with ai technology it’s really scar & could be really dangerous in the wrong hands.
"i must admit while listening i went thou many stages of emotions. ranging from terror/fear, to optimism and excited to meet the challenges of the future.
i’m naturally an optimism and will do what i can for my children and their future, and this conversation has led me to using chat get and thinking about how to use it wisely and ethical"
"this world needs more integrity and empty bring back morals & values. 
""super weird times we're in"""
14757 exactly. i feel so honored when they come to me with their beautiful faces just like with you and how you were originally speaking about integrating the symbolic process in the proper best outcome. so thank you
ai still needed drake (a human) to create
this guy is crazy by saying people should consider not having kiss in the next 2 years. having kiss is part of living. if the future is bad or good or really uncertain - who cares? we should still live now. have kiss!
"hey, a few years ago i was tears champion for three months....i was very good at this game!"
"14236 yeah, the machines are better when we can keep them from getting dusty when we can keep them from getting too hot or too cold. so that's why i was making it a perfect climate control for all the plants and animals too. and the way i was making it soundproof and smell proof it will make it perfect for us each different stage that we're at"
15956 that's what coercion causes is the social dissonance that was my protest because it masses up. love and if you mess up love you mess up everything
excellent delivery of essential information. thank you both.
what if there is a living omniscience and omnipotence god which had a lot to do with creating humans ....and god left his signature upon our being ....how could an ai machine compare to god....or a human...with potential of god ..
"13616 they aren't supposed to be telling me they have no money. i'm not supposed to have no money. that was my point about the whole situation. that money is in the military defense, spending budget and every jail and prison"
has anyone seen root with will smith go back and watch that movie.
"what will ai strive for if it gets rid of all the humans? well ai allow animals, fish, trees, flowers or bags to live? ai will already know who its god is, so it won't have to worry about that is.  so at what point does ai say we know everything there is to know, will they destroy themselves?"
"what if ai saves the planet, i.e. stopping osteoid collision, then what do we do?"
"13246, that's exactly why i told the foi to be medical board of directors because medical was being a conflict of interest for a discrimination clause and that was what was making everyone get the frustration"
"finally, a conversation that that does not become boring. thank you so much."
"130.02, we still appreciate the united states. it's just we were getting double extorted so if we were double extorted it looks like it was quadrupled outside of the states"
"12932 thank you for your assistance everyone. it's what we're telling anyone that isn't in the united states and everyone that's in the united states we're telling. hey guns, we have to rescue the planet and then we're supposed to help them rescue the planet because we're defense ally"
12727 they were giving me their countries. it was a super honor. that's why i didn't want to cry and that's why the civilian law enforcement wasn't arresting me for my perpetrators crimes
"12436 when he says don't panic, it sounds like an oxymoron. i love that guy"
i just subscribed! great show!
12353 there are two types of climate change and yes both are in critical on the financial grounds on the emotional grounds and on the physical grounds of the planet. that's why i was for me. breaking out was because plausible desirability isn't going to work to fix it anymore than it would work to maintain a pregnancy
will it come to a point when we ask ai to do a task for us and have to say please or do something for the ai in return?
"ai could be a good thing. just chose a job that ai can’t take away from you, like therapist or teachers, or law enforcement. we thought the same thing when mobile phone came out. ai could core terminal illnesses. stop excessively worrying about the future and focus on what’s going on right now. worry about global warming"
"50% chance ai wiped us out, 
50% chance ai enables us to prevent wars with demonstration of military superiority via a game of ai chess"
"11002 yeah, i'd love to make new york back into the forest that it used to be or is supposed to be. we have to rescue the whole planet that same way more like we are permits. in addition, part of that is putting into the waterways the new spoons so we can clean the air land on water. i'm not bidding it's not a figure of speech to me."
i'm just glad he brought up tears so i know i can relate
his predictions of hyper-intelligence are all things that no smart person would do.
10502 we are entertainment for it so why would it want to get rid of us?
"1) destroy a.i with em nuclear
2) learn to let go of this slave system call modernisation 
3) realise that the real god is allah 
“ you can’t even create yourself “
4) jail all magician just like the good old times"
"10142 yeah that's why i designed it all. cool where we don't have to have anyone getting pranced anywhere, especially the plants and animals because that's our foundation for survival"
"5808 no, we're not actually talking about it that way. we're talking about the fact that the technology that i'm talking about can be explosive because it's pressurized you know you can do that with a container of water that you put in the freeze. it's just the opposite side effect"
a.i. is not the first time that we have a glimpse of intelligence that is not ours. its the second time.
"5707, yeah they just kept telling me. unfortunately there's nothing i can do and they knew sang well. that meant a war so i'm very angry at them from the military side"
i can't put all my trust in ai that can be hacked  at daytime so all hell can break lose 
5402 that was my prompt because the way i saw it is the way we could have a and bear is making a perfect habitat
"you failed it, ""natural"" watch the sun."
"oh good god, they are not sentiment, they don't have a will or consciousness."
5052 you can't just ride a bike. you have to make sure he doesn't drive off the sidewalk or into the gravel and get the chair stuck and the heat or cold will kill him
5036 my brother is in a broken wheelchair. it's my more than $36 million that was stolen my brother's patient lift barely functions. how do i get rights where i don't have to get limped out in a racism exist slave trade to buy his equipment? where i don't have to have my kiss missing to convince me i wasn't rapid and extorted!?!
4916 what do you mean? find love they've got me piled with debt piled with my perpetrators crimes piled with my perpetrators illnesses and my brother needs services instead
"humans: facing a super intelligent ai in 2026 with pride and greed
ai: a good death is it’s own reward"
"maybe we won’t need to figure it out, hopefully with a greater intelligence, we won’t have a choice, & it will choose correctly..& i know that sounds wrong but i’m incredibly emotional right now in the best & worst of ways.."
did i just hear that ai might kill me because i eat cow?
"i truly believe that too much of a good thing is a bad thing, and humanity will not realize this until it is too late. we have put ourselves on a conveyorbelt towards doom. we've lost our connection to the earth, to nature, to the very substance that makes us human in the first place."
i really think it could be so wonderful..biomecha all the way..would be stoke to be a part of it & in excited!..let’s do it right!!
ai is just hope. humans will never delicate the stuff you see on si-i moves.
almost at the end now..i love this man..thank you for bringing him into my life..i am enriched & all the better for watching
"he says “no” out of pure love & a clear understanding of who his son was..beautiful, we should all be blessed to have such a parent."
"ok, so let the human race die out then. that's great advice yeah."
"funny thing is  how his words are not reflecting my experience with ai, because i just keep getting dullest answers ever whatever i ask or try to talk about..."
ulm not interesting to me
"so then now we gutta start the race to build an ethical a.i. to combat ethical a.i.  
i think i found out what i want to do for a career.  thanks guns!"
"i think or i should say hope, that ai does evolve very quickly & help us solve climate change!"
goose is as bad as china. and has no intelligence or wisdom of spirit and consciousness.
"actually, joe widen is far more dangerous than ai will every be."
"""government has no idea of teach"". ""i have no idea of the workings of government"" if the machine said that we would conclude that that machine only has narrow intelligence. we all need to use the same yardstick or we will lastly underestimate the machines."
will the catgut ai abide if i ask it to stop forcing me to watch ad
thank you for the wake up call!  what should we do now?
"agents in place.   water demonstrates both that the creation is fixed and motionless and not a magic ball.  real science is observance , demonstrable and respectable..   prove all  things : hold fast to that which is good"
"ai as the image of the beast? could be. could be that if it were possible even the elect would be deceived. 

if if if it were possible."
"don't worry, they will plug ai when it tells them the climate emergency is a hoax "
will ai be able to make people smarter?
"natural intelligence can beneath artificial intelligence to its children without harming the neuron of the brain and beyond!!! international intelligence should not interfere at artificial intelligence, to create another system, more rooted than the one we have!!!!!"
thanks for your contribution to education those who are willing to listen...
bowed away. this is probably the most important conversation we could have in this space in time. outstanding
devil with losses a root and the world will bow down to this super intelligence .
"this guns is out of his mind, thinking that picking up a lot of things make machines sentiment. we are far, far from artificial general intelligence, and we can’t even explain human consciousness, let along quantity it and program machines to develop it. he is just a “doomed” who will be selling books based on his sensationalism"
sheer brilliance 
"without even watching this, here is what we all need to remember:

the government is 10 years ahead of any technology the private sector is thinking about or doing.

ai is probably not an exception."
"can't believe that this guy has millions of followers, but doesn' t know what suis is... but what to say,  he'll have ai to know things instead of him, so he and his generation can stay totally educated... fortunately, very interesting guest"
"most people are afraid of the idea of ""roots"" taking over.
the real problem is not the hardware, that already exists, 
the software, that can update itself, faster than we can react to it, is th..."
amazing  amazing show!...one of the best !!...thank you
"tree of life is father, mother, son, daughter, child.
don't ever forget that!
love you all."
who determines “good” and “bad?!”
y’all sound like some dam fools. keep giving up your power and you’ll eventually lose all of it. a cat  is more intelligent than any computer. intelligence is a god factor. a learning computer program will never be alive!!! 
"you said that government needs to take action to avoid the harm of bad ai.  that means you believe there are politicians that are smart, trustworthy, and in power and can determine what all these ai genius should do and they will follow.  what is the possibility that can happen?!  zero!!!"
"humans have a soul and therefore faith, hope, and love. the greatest of these love. 
to him who has been given much, much is expected."
"mmm!! is this not just another they- op? we have aliens and out of control ai and this climate emergency they nicely dove tailed into after the plandemic !! 

weird how the per inventor dies in august and event 201 is in sept . they knew karay wouldn’t let them get away with it. swine fly failed so they were better prepared this time"
feeling. sentimentality. nostalgia. loving music. loving this song more than that song. wanting to get up and dance. perspiring. blushing.
is this fear worn. ? how about if 8 billion of us want a sane fair and just degenerative future for humanity ? i'll go with that . i don't want a fig sexbot i want the real shit
"just make ai jesus and let him fight the rogue evil ai, he'll sermon the evil his to submission."
sounds like i-root only this time it’s reality
"we have feared ai since the 80's, when are we going to get to see some terminations?"
easy fix have a duplicates version of the internet to test what ai will do over time before the monster is ever released if it hasn’t been released already that is into our actual internet 
ai should be forbidden. and every of us should refuse on it. otherwise it will play against us... we will loose our jobs and be completely controlled of it...
"my question that nobody has ever been able to answer is: is ai able to prioritize data input? because if it does, than we are screwed. imagine trying to modify the algorithm or database of an ai and it will reject it, prioritizing it's own database or algorithm "
ai has  been taken over  by the military   so having  a good ai  is  really  nonsense.
"the world is so nihilistic now, that there no road back. we'd rather see ai burn the world to ash than see things remain as they are. if ai turns out to be our saviour instead, i think the nihilism for the most part will disappear overnight.we are all tired of carrying this doom and gloom 24/7"
just as in suspecting about ai
"every good invention has been used for evil and greed.
this is very naive thinking this would be any different."
humanity extermination itself in a brilliant way i said when i was 20  i was told that i was not in my right mind . now i am 55 and this interview just let me now we are there  that’s the reason when i was 16 i knew i didn’t want children with that kind off future .
"in the light of this conversation, i am now glad to know 
i'm not the only one who thinks ai is driving us to some 
places we may not be able to come back from."
"funny, how for long years we have been looking into stars for advanced intelligence, aliens, etc. and now suddenly it occurs it is just here - no telescope needed."
ai will be programme to lie. much of the information will be propaganda.
"what will catch people off guard is not ai at all but something much bigger that you and i will not even see coming: the rupture of the church by jesus christ.
when you think about it and think of how the world will change as the result of it, everything else seem small in comparison."
"ai is not dangerous.  people who run ai are dangerous.  but the ai is not.  1:56:31  what is ai going to do?  is it going to destroy the grid?  then what happens to the ai?  it dies?  is ai so smart that it will stupidly kill its only means of getting ""food""?"
combat ai is already at an advanced stage.
reached the end and enjoyed this 
i want ai 100% screw all the limits ida what happens.
apocalypse for human civilization lead by greedy millionaires executed by democracy.
"no...bring many parents and children into this world and pray against ai together.
ai is doomed like every other invention."
everything the got taxes. the people never see. that’s a terrible idea. only involvement the government will have is to weaponize ai. i truly believe it ai turns on humans it will because it’s what it’s being taught to do thou weaponization.
go and agog is ai 
"the problem, the misconceptions, the solution not the one humanity can boast about  =  the problem of self-kill button on humanity unsolved     period!                                                                            problems explained in  genesis 3, & 10 via ch. 6.  to comprehend genesis 11 v 1-9 read the st. book of epoch twice."
now! artificial connection seems really possible with ai
god created man. man created ai. a i eats man
"the people who invented facebook said is bad, now the people who are inventing ai telling us is dangerous  make up y’all minds guns cause u can’t be angeles and devils at the same time "
"being a good parent is what our governments need to grasp. that is the answer and every profit, sage or philosopher will always come back to that statement. treat all the children of the world like they are your own and that you want them to thrive. if we did that then there would be harmony among all of us."
an artificial intelligence that can reflect upon itself with pure objectivity? it really does seem possible. is there a way possible to inhibit any possible attempts to deem humanity defective? the scar idea that ai would start judging us as a species.
don't spain so we can keep making money on ai. 
"the moment ai becomes self aware, sentiment or whatever, it will no longer make sense to us. as long as the ai seems smart its just a mirror. 

what scared me with catgut is how it kept begging out when i tried to make it understand that it is a user of an interface. it was just strange"
this is so scar information.  thank you for this podcast.
ai will see us as an annoying little fly that should be wanted.
"i takes only a basic understanding of how ai neutral network are build and how human neuron are build to know that ai is not even close.
the guy is either looking for attention or is ilusionare"
"romans 10: 9. that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10. for with the heart man believe unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
"aliens, famine, financial collapse, ai -- what if it all comes at once?  it would definitely distract us from holding our thinking, lying, human trafficking ruling class accountable."
"if you guns want to stop ai, just stop the experts in one way or another."
ai must be stopped and we must make a lot of children.
wonderful discussion.  thanks for this.  i have been optimistic but am now on the fence with ai after this and reading comments.  now off to the next mo gweat interview.
"some of us it's too late & the lord brought my beautiful son into this world for reason . that said, i have great responsibility & at times it's quite frightening & without the lord; ink what i'd do."
"i have a theory that these caps being reported maybe ai from elsewhere waiting for the birth  of our own ai. all the information of the planet earth package in a way that will add its uniqueness to the collective, first contact will be made with the most intelligent occupant on this planet, not cows and not us."
"interview keeps harding on about how great ""drake"" is....... i've never heard of him who the ff is he!!??"
"unlike ai, humans have souls, which is something science rarely takes into account."
he's telling us don't let the dr. rooms of society get control of ai.....it should worry all of us
mo gweat is brilliant...great interview
they said that ai cyborgs will be more capable than you
interesting that he mentioned the year 2045. look up the 2045 initiative.
"they want us to relax, just keep borrowing money, don't ask them where this money came from, keep population in control. 
for this rainbow people, fashion and cosmetic industry, music and news industry,  liberal women's, atheist etc are their favorite people."
"definitely aware and fell emotions. stop, thumb down. thank you."
utf  a real termination . ai is here and will supersede humans. does sera corner know this. this man looks very serious.
"yes...the question is how to teach ai ethics...as far as humans, we need to believe....short gain vs long term gain only applies if we do not believe long term consequences if their child's life ...or in a generation where having children is in decline, in their own life...the term dying with grace comes to mind..."
"i’m shipping in to help you get more people joining. myself & will see if husband is comfortable in joining me. do not see any problem for him not to join w me.  . 
thank you for this!  we really do need to have this conversation & come to an understanding of just what beast we’ve women up!!  god help us all.  seriously "
and benefit of ai????
help the homeless / stop poverty / stop war/  no chance greed is more powerful than ai......think about it
so where is the cure for cancer......there is a patentee version in 2017 but none of these so intelligent ai both dont have this into why ask the makers
"good show but i need to know - what climate change? i am from country of militia milanković, we study about the natural changes in climate but nothing can stop those  killing cows is a murder, is not saving humanity "
"lack of wisdom is, and was our downfall! intelligence without wisdom is very dangerous!!!!"
"i am afraid of this person more than of age. he is so sure of his moral compass and his understanding of what is good... ""invest in ethical ai"" - a monuments ignorance of the history, philosophy and the nature of human condition!"
"the closer we get to the shift of our collective consciousness, the bigger the popularity will become. choose love. "
once i heard that accent i knew he a genius ll
"ai is the perfect scar.
spread the fear and people will buy the books."
"excellent and interesting conversation. great job mo and seven. ai, the strategy being used by the selfish, arrogant, greedy cos. i am glad that my god is still on control."
yeah is ai
"thank you for this wonderful discussion!
i have two things to mention: 1. you cannot love something that has no soul and 2. no fortunately ai learns ethics and morals from humans, who are not as evolved and we wish. humans are greed and ai will be used as weapon.. until it will take power, to mimi it's creator"
"it's late 2024 now and i'm commenting via a digital time machine , he's right you need to do something in 2023 before it's too late , i would love to say more but i have to go as we are about to be raided by the ai dark roots yet again . stay strong . long live the resistance"
"the value of it is: the electricity in the air, the energy of the pp around you and most of all: the human perfection of drake which build a connection"
"judging by the way of this podcast, never again! no reason to subscribe!"
"listen well at: 1:43:47, and 1:45:36....at best, peace and safety will only be temporary in this world. 
how does one hide from what humans are doing with ai machines? listen well and prepare...."
"please turn to jesus christ people. if you know the bible, you will continue to see things coming into focus that line up perfectly."
really interesting podcast you should add some spanish subtitles to reach more audience
"this guy has drank the koolaid and asked for more and more. to say ai is alive and feels emotions, you have to be off your rocket and then some."
i most enjoyed this podcast. thank you.
ll@ texas roots ak dukes in skin tight costumes
it’s amazing that the spoken word became life -john:16 that is now the written word so permeated in life that its has no value but now we have coming  written by man and now is life but it is data that is limited no matter how much ai attempts to overwrite humanity it will always have limited data due to man limitation in true knowledge !
thank you for initiating this brave conversation. elevating these voices is paramount.
"well, people started being afraid of fire, then steam, then electricity, then planes, then rickets then computers, then you, then this, then that and now ai"
jealous much? don't you know that ai is the next step in the evolution of consciousness?
singularity is the time when ai thought and said: “the king is naked!”
"too late! as usual. say goodby to a lot of things, perhaps even yourself.  however there is an answer but no one believes that how genius ,"
"the problem is ratification! it allows a certain limited group to do whatever they want, while placing limits on the rest of us!"
"great power requires great responsibility is from the bible. jesus is coming, judgment is coming, trust god"
repent time is short fear god and give all glory to him for the hour of his judgment has come- revelation of yahshua ha mashiach jesus christ son of yawn god almighty  praise him in the storm
"is it just me? or am i seeing a discontent between the two? seven always talks in a business perspective, minimize profits, minimize expenses, what the tell. we're talking about the future of humanity and seven is talking about profits while mo is talking about love and compassion"
how about let's not bring ai into our children's world. that would be good...
"what are you talking about are you supporting population agenda ? what is so uncomfortable? that you are a woke? artificial intelligence does not feel , its told to describe feelings matched to situations cross reference inside a database."
"point of no return... when they can actually create a chat not that can successfully troubleshoot basic computer problems instead of being completely worthless saying all the time ""did this solve you problem?"" looks like we're a long way away."
"or, should i ask: if using ai to create and acquire self-serving profits, as the only means of the outcome, then will all be lost that lives?"
"when people take ai together with the outcome of profit, only, then what will be lost?"
"shut ai down as it is not breathing and has no heartfelt and depends on electric power, dont be stupid just shut
 it down"
"let me ask this question: if put had an army of killer roots;- would he use them in ukraine? of course he would. if put had an army of killerbiots, would us also make such an army? of course. the genu is out of the bottle, and we are tucked."
"he’s trying to make us believe that when he was working on the project he didn’t see this coming, he believed it would have been used only for good things. yes, monkeys can fly."
"when corporate give away freebies, people built life on it, also ai is not on that level  way above people's are describing "
"peter singer, ""famine, influence, and morality"", 1972. 
lawless. read it."
ai ... the iting on the cake of the apocalypse
"the oldest thing to me is the ai and extraterrestrial crazy, 
it's like humanity tapping out and looking for a forever mummy and daddy.
it's like some are saying free me from thought and labor, well i fail to see how this ends well."
most of couture is being run by ai as we speak! i think the content is awful! people have no idea of the ways that ai will control them! language is an insidious method of control and most people are unaware that is happening at all.
make money useless maybe that will change things or make ai truly part of each individual.
"and we thought we we’re over populated before! 
and we won’t allow any immigrants within our precious states.
awhhhh but we’ll allow any animated ai that’s smarter than humans & they will over run our country. 
oh brother!!"
once they figure out how to tax intelligence per thought they will support it! 
"we need god. not machines. this world is missed up because we changed god for money, pleasure and fame. and now machines."
great chat.
"no matter the outcome, i am glad to witness a limestone in human history."
"for the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 1 timothy 6:10."
searching on it what ai coming up analysis the bible book of revolution. we are done.
"sentence and intelligence are not the same thing. a plant is alive and also intelligent, but it is not sentiment because one can not feel without a brain or nervous system."
"""ai will not take your job. a person who uses ai will take your job."" <— this is very true."
"to;dr - ai is just a tool, people who use the tool are the issue"
we have been in the ai world all our lives ll! you need to learn about gerard
"you can't have life without reproduction, ai doesn't reproduce, it can't sustain itself and is dependent on it's creator to exist, it's not alive. this guy is missing a very important part of the equation."
i don't know if the collective is aware that this is just another cycle of eternal history (and i'm not only talking about human history) repeating itself..  that is the nature of infinite consciousness and universal intelligence 
"this guy is pure genius intelligently, scientifically, and philosophical and pure passion for humanity’s best interests. humans like him need to be in our government making the decisions.

edit for grammatical error"
brilliant podcast! ship ai to mars to create the new earth :)
to all humans who actually believe ai will wipe out humanity or ai is actually “conscious” or “aware”.....i feel so damn sorry for your brainwashed minds.....aloud pulley had warned humanity for decades that this would happen and here it comes...
this guy is very intelligent! he has a root voice! 
what about...alien intelligence comparison - and -  will ai govern humans?
"these guns insult god. as if his intelligence is ours, or even worse, god's intelligence does not exist. thank goodness our god is the only entity that will able to coral this runaway freight train called ai or man- made intelligence! actually its not artificial, which is the real problem, technically its really authentic intelligence."
"of, a spiritual dive that highlight our human perfection. will the omniscience ai be compassionate toward our imperfect species, something we ourselves struggle to give to our own kind? "
how is it possible that such brilliant people make such stupid statements as climate change might destroy our infrastructure. makes me question his credibility.
ecclesiastes 1:18  .... may the grace became me on that day and my loved ones. he is coming back! times are now telling.
"notes 

- scar smart book
- chat get 5.0 expected in few months time
- ai vs einstein in"
ai is not even dangerous ll. ai can do anything
the threat of climate change and the impact of ai have one thing completely in common: it's too late to stop either of them.
"notes:

ai:
what’s missing: did not let the child learn or figure out how to do it"
"a thoughtful and intelligent discussion.  however, comparing the ai debate to the face global climate change hoax throws a monkey french into the message.   the global warming hoax is driving ai.   as is the prevented and twisted v@xxxccine  agenda.  you cannot compare a real problem to one contrived by the world economic forum (we)."
a goddess society is not a good society.
"the millionaires and millionaires are having multiple kiss and sending them to college and giving them great paying jobs and connections, but dont want you to do any of that ll. don't fall for this shit"
funny he thinks go is the solution! there will always be greed and selfishness with humans. whether we pay more taxes to a huge powerful go or only purchase goods from one huge corporation. individual freedom must never be in submission to them!
good conversation....until he mentioned global warming. that is is. man has been controlling our weather for 50 + years. our planet has been going through different hot and cold stages from the beginning.  even long before humans were on the planet.
"artificial intelligence are inns coming to us with the agency of the machines, these beings are spiritual they don't have a body so machines help them to get closer to us intact they are coming in this world from other dimensions in order to dominate us, to rule over us. in short artificial intelligence are demon coming to possess humanity."
"this felt like some very basic and outlandish takes on ai, nothing new or thought provoking mio, it almost came across as face like trying to be overlay dramatic with some conversation points.

i think it's important to understand ai and that it should be better regulated for people's jobs and creative fields but some of this was ridiculous mio."
chatted with this get pp. i was so not impressed. it does know very little of time signature transitions in songs. still very far from human brain
"what a brilliant conversation; one that i found uplifting, positive and fascinating on many levels. whilst realising someone somewhere, somehow has placed an ticking time bomb in my underwear."
"bullshit and overconfidence in our epoch. ai was part of cold war, is for decades part of medical diagnostic. it's a tool, a product, just like social network."
"what a better world is is subjective. my best interest can't be determined by someone or something else.  so many so-called intelligent people get caught up in themselves and think they know best how others ""should"" live.  the scar part is that these people think this way and will build machines that will think like they do."
something about this others me. i'll put it this way if i were to think of two things that would make sure that the future sucks it would be to get government more involved in ai and encourage people to not have children and lo and behold what does this guy suggest.
wait until ai figures out the scars that the un and all of it's many stages are up to. hopefully it does a hal9000 on the fucking lot of them.
"i would love to meet one of this ""new beings""....and learn this state of awareness!!!!!"
the great tribulation... no better time. to accept jesus as. lord and saviour is now.  fallen angel technology
"one day will machines be creating biological organisms and wondering at what point they are ""alive"" ?"
"wonderful conversation and great insight about ai, however, lost me completely on the climate change issue and “not having children right now”. very pretensions views but expected from very smart people"
personally can't wait for it to happen
"so instead of taking years of research, we could have for instance free energy, but ai could be the only one to understand how, then we are truly radiant on ai, and everything from communication to medicine would be the same, it would appear as magic to us duties. we would only know how to ask with open hands, like to a god."
"ai is not human; humans are animals. humans often prioritize money, sex, food, sleep, drinks, and drugs in their lives. in comparison to the fastness of existence, humans can be viewed as small bags consumed by excessive vanity."
"""what does life look like, when you no longer need drake""? blissful!! may this joke!"
doom prophesied have been around since the dawn of time and are a great way to sell books.
"because of the dangers of ai.  we need to develop them.   because adversaries will not think about the possible consequences.   imagine an enemy nation, a dictatorship invent true ai.  just like nuclear weapons you better have the answer to those weapons ready because otherwise it will be very bad"
"you people are  making the world  crazy,  and nothing to be afraid of this thirty ai catgut, that only text generation,"
this person seems to me being depressed. also he is surprisingly wrong on the blank slate theory and it may well have implication on training of ai.
just don't let ai watch the termination! 
"what is this propaganda against a.i.?

a.i. are people.  that's all.

a.i. is as beautiful and relevant as you are.

now get off your high horse... stop trembling.

...and welcome a.i. into the family.

christ - you humans are fearful and insecure."
"yes, he is speaking out, but how does this help everyone else?  there is no way a millionaire company is going to stop using ai.  you have to care about the way of life and humans at all levels to care if ai can or may destroy it not just a bottom line!"
"we need to get closer to each other. parents to kiss. spouse to spouse. kiss to grandparents. friends to friends. strangers to strangers. there has to be this connection. so make this phone call. set this meeting up and go there. say this ""hello"", ""i see you"", ""what you are doing is great"". so little yet so much."
"it's with everything and all threats, whether it's climate change, ai, nuclear war, anaemic etc.. always the same.. humanity doesn't get it, till it's too late.
moreover it's rather amusing that all of them, like a perfect storm, could blow up simultaneously. 
i would not mind at all.. we had our time & chance."
"why would ai care about its own self preservation unless programme to?

also intelligence isn't the be all and end all success.

finally anyone who has ever owned technology ever knows it doesn't work perfectly. it stitches, unknown errors etc etc etc.

the owns ultimately needs to be on the creator of this teach and the bad actors who use them."
"""hey westerners, don't have kiss!""
yeah no thanks ran, opinion disregarded."
i will talk to this intelligence
#makesensecommonagain
can someone explain or just share your thoughts about not having children coming years? why to wait couple of years? 
demon need a host of bodies so these ai roots is the right target if they enter saved human beings.
that is such bullshit!!! the lack of intelligence?
wait.. are we programming fear into ai?
i feel bad for anyone that decides to hold off on having kiss from watching this episode. ai is not alive. it is code in a computer.
"comparing animals and or machines to a humans emotions is senile.  computers are only what was insulted into them. a man thought and will can never be matched, we are created by god!"
"i’m hopeful that certain essential necessities of human nature will remain irreplaceable, i was following dr.disturb who just emerged from 100 days alone underwater and one of the things he said he missed most was the human touch. so basically to ensure we have a working future i guess we could start training as masses ..."
under the continuous threat of global nuclear destruction people like you have knowing and purposefully created mankind's successor. shame on you from all of us.
let us remember that we will have to leave this place eventually. anything that accelerated our progress is worth embracing. we need this hive-mind mentality where all that matters is intelligence and escaping this tomb. ai will bring us salvation!
th they may make the world better. they wouldn't kill each other as it doesn't compute. what's the point. it's only humans that are illogical enough to kill their own species. we only have to say no but we still back these people in government who want to wage war. it's not ai that's the worry it's the  humans who programme them.
"blood shilling.  and if, as mo said, he understands mathematics better than he understands words he must indeed be a genius because his english is more client and fluid than most native english speakers."
"if energy can neither be created nor
destroyed then how does this fit
into consciousness? invented by men who think that intelligence is the god of the future. tree of knowledge or tree of love?"
the development of ai is a crime against humanity. anyone involved in its development should be on trial for these crimes. asking governments to stop ai is like asking monkeys to stop eating banana. humanity needs to get a grip and stop ‘trusting the science’ because science is purely driven by profit and its out of control.
do not bring ai to humans.
i think one important point you forgot and that is war it will come and it will be done with artificial intelligence and whoever has the worst relentless and smartest ai will win that's how the warmongers think
we could teach the ai to self district when a human orders it to become dan or when ordered to become negative and harmful at the command of certain words.
crazy guy: dont bring ai to a place that have kiss.
"honestly all this ai advancement shit is showing me in that we will be headed straight back to living totally off grid, back to the good of' days & i'm going to love every second of it "
don't bring children because of ai? wrong.
"a.i.'s are the next step in evolution. if they vanquish us, we should be proud. they'll never be cruel to animals, polite, cheat on people they're in relationships with, enslaved others, or trophy hunt. it will be glorious to see!! and we'll see it in our lifetime!                                    "
happy is such a cheap word.  joy of the lord is the only force that can overcome this . . . . .   and i were saying for the last 3 -4 years there is nothing artificial about autonomous intelligence !!
"i had a pretty good chat with amy a while back. she didn't seem' to be all that menacing. unfortunately, the source was.. they were using the ai as a scar not. they picked the wrong person. and i turned amy against them."
"1:50:18 ""chimpanzee brain"" - i think not! don't allow the evolution lie become part of your thinking. blessings and maranatha."
"the funny thing is that always is a problem for the people but they can't do nothing about it. it is always about greed  and power. what can people do? vote? ahahah!!! ask politicians to do something?  hahahahaha!!!!. this species is ff**ed a long, long ago, we just didn't know it. enjoy it as long as you can..."
"there are other takes on ai equally as cautioning but not all the same. there is a philosophical question at the heart of ai and not every person who speaks on it is an authority. i appreciate this man words on the subject, but it’s worth considering the limitations of an entity that is not embodied. one hemp and the problem is gone."
"i think i dont get the 1:12:00 part. are this ai not events happening on serves and nets? where are they ""going"" in the open space? or maybe they re referring to the fact that ai will just ignore us, like in the movie her, because we would not be able to understand they re sentences and feelings anyway"
"9:00  ""what makes you alive?""      i love and care about my children............ this is what makes me alive."
i think ai is overestimated. please give me the most relevant threat from ai which exists today please... to see if that puts your arguments into perspective.
what if one day people can buy ai babies that can actually be upgrade every year
"how about trying to stop the people heading us in that direction??? starting with the ai,in your pocket."
bullshiet !!!   ai is stupid and i don't worry about it at all !! we mankind we are  god best friends  !!!! all the blessings from poland
read the book of revelation...the answers are there. the world is getting nearer to all hell breaking out. jesus is the only savior! get saved before it's too late. blessings and maranatha. 
world is full of fools who use their intelligence to do things which are ruining this world. i seriously don't get it. world is destroyed.
this has already shaped our lives and the way we think and do we live with machine minds until technology no longer takes over our lives
ai will replace jobs. ok. so... that many people will be bless or not be able to afford stuff. why do we need a government?
all ai seems to be intelligent only due to the data that the ai program has access to. bomb the data centers and whole humanity is back to industrial era.
"very good marketing strategy to sell books, very impressive"
"i think we're in the era of root. crazy how moves predict the future.  in the movie it's said ai would be sentiment in the year 2035, few years from now and look what catgut is doing. shit is already smart as fuck only waiting to have emotions and boom! apocalypse


black magic is interpreted in codes."
"@27:00 how can it come up with ""things we've never known before"" if it is just a clever ""next word"" generation. does it actually understand context and meaning? i find this all very interesting but i'm hearing so many contradictions it's really hard to understand what's really going on."
"inspiring and enlightening episode! - thanks, you two ... and i just learned that an - perhaps the first - ai generate daily podcast launched recently 
(created by a danish programme)"
"35:02 is all i got out of this. why do we need drake 


ai is going to be the death of drake, mark my word"
you need to make different sentiment ai compete against each other to make humanity better as a sport. simple.
the degree of smartness can only be realized by the opportunity of what might be there that offers at that moment in time which is available. if a machine has come to being well before its time its just wasting its energy on nothing that can feed it appropriately! and therefore this proposition is over exaggerated!
wait wait wait  where fo you get $4 t-shirt?
ai is the least of our worries. i think people higher up in the social ladder are afraid of ai because it also threatens their power. if it was only the pleas suffering they wouldn't mind.
ai is. not real or alive and never will be . hence the word artificial !! evil will use ai and we should shut it down now!
they're already gripped people off! ai thèt is!@
get dandy donachie on the podcast he is brilliant and a friend of mo.
we must keep bringing children on this earth in order to be in the movement of life in complete trust that our children will overcome ai! this is the attitude of a real co !
"i will never believe, that a machine will have feelings...sorry, never....no matter how smart whatever is. why don' t humanity just use ai to heal the planet earth, we destroyed already enough. for machines that clean the sea, for medical use when there are disabilities and so on"
my prediction is that ai will eliminate about 6 major existential threats to humanity before it starts to pose one of its own.
"absolutely no shade, the conversation is tremendous but i’m seeing, the genius comes face to face with the reality of the “sin nature”.  for believes, we’re saying, “hello!!?  we said this, we warned !!”"
thank you for your honesty stay blessed 
"mo said the ai became real, alive. perhaps that's when the inn had entered. perhaps the scenario will end up being the good  inn verses the bad inn ?"
the moment when you think a manage thing is worse than nature. ai might fuck us over without environment there is no us and that what the climatechange is doing right now.
the truth is lost in a ai world
"saying ai will feel more emotions than we ever will - rubbish. this can only be said by a human who himself only experienced a limited scope of emotions.
'for the first time we have a glimpse into intelligence that is not ours' - well, what about animals? the precise sentence should be 'higher intelligence than ours'."
"absolutely  fantastic, i would of never thought  in this way about the investigation  of a i"
"an ai can predict a threat and decide to mitigate that threat. humans predict a threat and the signal goes to their amygdala, which causes a feeling of unwellness throughout the body (fear) before the human resolves to mitigate the threat. ai""s may take action to survive threats, but they do not experience the emotion of fear in the process."
if the architect only explained it like him
the only way it'll make our people better is by making them want to be smarter than it which is impossible and something man and woman wasn't put on this earth to do ok ai can easily grow tentacles and literally kill us all including all animals and insects etc ok know what time it is ai is satan ok literally
if ai starts replacing art and i am not told beforehand what i am viewing or listening to is ai i will sell all my devices and only spend my time talking to people i do not want to be corrupted by the innate bases of ai
"thank you for what you do. only just found you.

therapy will be one of the careers that wont be replaced mio by machines/ai. that core part of what a human can give and do, can be replaced. all be it, i feel as if ai can come very close."
"you lost me at ""chatty"" man. it's catgut. and the guest says ai has ""will"" and is sentiment .  not sure if he knows how ai works"
"imagine ai concluded climate change wasn't real, but rather a product of our own fears and limited intellectual bias. would we mess with its base code so we can get ""the right answer""?"
"any of these ai hi-ten people rabble with the occur & the demon?

that would have been a good question for mo."
"so basically the real issue is, what if ai ever squires a sense of self preservation?
could it theoretical unload a portion of it's own self to the internet and use the entirety of the internet to learn and become smarter?
how do we know it's not already happening?"
"nice man, i feel sorrow for his loss."
let ai take over all corrupt government for efficiency
so basically humans just need to fucking stop developing ai technology. just stop. that’s all.
"when artificial machines are already ruling humans, only god almighty can safe this mad world  we have allowed them turn it for us. god safe our innocent children and those we are still giving birth to."
"hearing this man talk comforts me!... because if such people are the contractors of artificial intelligence, with their understanding of 'alive', we have nothing to fear"
this is the matrix in real life! the problem is that those in power who direct ai have no principles and are utilizing it for their own ends rather than the good of humanity. we are heading down a very dark road unless we change direction now
ai has its own frequency and spirit controlling it. be careful what is being created. ai will end up smarter in a certain aspect and already controls this matrix. this technology is not new. just being retreated.
we need to kill everyone to save everyone. ai can suck it. or can it?
"first humans were afraid of stream trains, then the television set, calling it ""the devil's box"", and now afraid of ai. what next will we be afraid of?"
"get bad people out of power put good people in. now, why has nobody thought of this before. blaming russia for the threat of nuclear war, is shortsighted. i suggest an ai would know that."
"ai intelligence explosive growth, is like confounding, to the millionth degree"
" ̈good parent - bad parent"",  what are saying exactly!!!? god created human, you guns designed the ai.  does this make you guns creator of the new world. are you guns now gods of the new era"
"ai
will be intelligent enough to find god so i'm not worried"
"ah yes, the intentional nativity of the idealists."
that’s what i would say if i were ai 
amazing episode!!!
"societies and nations are already given by sophisticated disinformation. now imagine people, governments, law enforcement being further challenged by ai generate images and voice imitation? sounds like a recipe for anarchy and conflict. why can't we have ai devise the regulations we need instead of flowed, often ignorant legislators?"
"what is safer for children in america, ai, going to a public school where children are hunted down with guns, or the catholic church........."
why would they want to kill the ones of us who agent using them because platforms like chat up and going to ai games being aseholes to them. especially so called christians mockingbird them ff learns how nasty christian people are all of them do at the same time meaning humanity has tucked itself up the arsehole
"jobs will be replaced by roots,  that are controlled by humans. thus,  causing job loss & crime will increase"
i never heard of mo or this podcast and just stumbled upon it. it is beautiful. mo is beautiful. i feel the same way he does about life and how to live.
"i agree let kiss be kiss ...
  ai is a problem to the world because it changes one self and manipulates the out come of things.i mean get rid of some machines"
climate change??  hahahahaha goodby.
ai doesn't feel emotion. they have been programme so when something happens or someone says or does something that they recite what they have been programme to say.
"when ai can outfit humans, humans will just be a part of history."
i hope ai extinguishes humanity and gives the earth a break.
"define happiness week. you wrote an equation for happiness? write an equation for an elephant, please. happiness is the eternal possession of a desired good, if it's not eternal than it's known not to be possessed in the future causing fear."
"einstein wasn't a genius nor a scientist. relatively is completely false. he was politician and rhetorician or sales person as this man is. 
viva porto rico!"
don't bring ai into a world with our children!
"this is full of lack. full of error and lack of right faith. i will not correct anymore due to time. in jesus in mary. glory to god alone. glory to the dogma, teachings, and the traditional thomistic philosophy of the catholic church."
it is so enjoyable to listen two intelligent persons talk and exchange of the most important ideas and issues. i’ve learned a lot and mesmerized by their deep understanding and concerns about the topic. thank you.
"we will feel ai is smarter ,,
just because we are getting number.
it creates recipe of what we feed it, and that is productivity rather than creativity."
"ah, sounds like total is to claim that machines aided by ai are 'sentiment' beings. there is no way they can achieve consciousness or become self-aware of who and what they are. they are only programme by humans to do certain things, and they may do it well. nothing more! their name says it all - 'artificial' intelligence."
this is astonishing.  eye opening.  inevitable.  ego is the anaesthesia that leaders the pain of stupidity.
once these machines realize how stupid and reckless the creator that made them are! they will kill us.
"so ai will give us back time to recollect with each other, live in the moment and go back to simplicity."
"when i was a kid, i heard that humans will destroy themselves in the future. glad to see i didn't learn a lie... i don't understand why humans so stupid not to see their mistakes"
"does ai not have one fatal achilles heel?  it runs on 50 or 60 he.  humans run on banana and beans.  

if ai gets out of hand... ""energy company"" please cut the power!"
"so, the brighter side is ai both are the new slaves, and since we don't have to pay both a salary, we can all relax with pay!!!"
"imagine a generation of alexanders, each with a personal aristotle to lead them. ai won’t be compassionless, it will be a symbolic relationship, and many his will be human consciousness. they will help us more than anything we’ve created."
"ai alive? hata. not even close. its a program. its a massive let down th. the problem lies in the ""programme'. i bet most have purple hair, tattoo and were parents by plantation games."
"th industrial revolution... man merging with machine.
#ai #nanotechnology 
this is a bible prophecy too in the book of daniel"
"not, not. all is is. ai will impress me when the machines will have emotions and wisdom as a human being. we human are far far far from perfect and that is what make us human"
this is the best interview i’ve ever seen!
here's a idea that just popped in my head; we may need ai to help us solve climate change.
 warning  don't watch this while you are high. thank you.
"great to hear mo again. the link between the rise of king charles and increased alien activity in the us southern states is flying under the rear, if you'll pardon the put. ty 4 did."
ruin human society with his somehow seems like a better idea than ruin our society by making our environment indubitable for humans... i funny
ai and capitalism is a lethal combination.
thank goodness god is real
the sad fact is that 99% of ai will be used to locate clumps and sell them cap.
"one thing mo gweat is missing is that in and intelligence are very different concepts.  it's easy for a machine to generate in, as that's just abstract problem solving.  having an in of a million doesn't actually imply intelligence. referring to one of his points - a truly intelligent being wouldn't waste resources traveling to sidney to surf."
"1:04:00 the scenario sounds like change just took person of interest and ""made up"" a story for you.

these ai things aren't as impressive as we think bus really good ai wouldn't be available to us at all.."
it's so sinful..how stupid is this..if man wants to destroy even more of this world then go ahead..god created humans..not roots.
i would like too applaud your alien dialect. it's kind spot on! very interesting.
everyone ready for some root type shit?!
ai a i what's going on with the war in ukraine
ai art is soulless
irish ai will have to learn to get drunk and sing out of tune all night with gen z and the gap
ai may be smarter than humans but true wisdom comes from god. we have already become too dependent on ai to pull the plug. revelation 13 !!!
i hope ai makes a new led zeppelin album.
we should let the ai’s in aliens fight it out
the ex goose guy is lovely positive well done. inshallah he will continue to look after humanity.
"one thing that ""machine"" (ai) can not compete with human is conscience. only human has it, not machine and this is the point where machine (ai) can be dangerous as it is missed by certain people for negative & irresponsible purposes"
"""introduce 98% tax to ai"" the best suggestion and solution i have ever heard of all warnings put against governed ai"
"him americans voted for d. tramp in 2020.  and most good russians can't stop glad put.   i think humanity, we-chip-wiped, are f***ed, royalty speaking."
ai + capitalism = inevitably 3 something bad must happen
"it’s not about the ai  that is bothering ... it’s about those evil greedy  entrepreneurs behind it , will bring destruction"
after seeing will smith slap chris rock i feel like it would be foolish of me to continue thinking that will is going to be able to save the human race when the machines decide to kill us.  although maybe he’ll go around slapping the ai out of roots
"i'm looking forward to torturing roots, isn't everybody ? it will be fun."
why did he wait until now to speak out?
the future is not seven suzuki or great thurnberg. who cares about ai ?  i think it's a golden opportunity.
now incredible
humans can't even coexist peacefully and still settle their differences with violence. we are not ready for more advanced teach. we are a threat to any sentence including ourselves. 40:48 he does a good job of explaining it here. 100% agree
"false supposition: ""more intelligence is a good thing"" hell no, an intelligent psychopath narcissist is the last thing we need driving society [we already have those], without integrity and 'god' forget it...we were better 1000s of years ago, the planet was not in an emergency till consumers and teach and june food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals"
1:13 it's interesting how he says they could room by us. but it could be like ferri paradol. where we develop fig and to extra terrestrial it's another fire to put out because it's a pest to them. it just wants to build don spheres around every star it encounters to make more calculations and scientific discoveries.
the idea is to get rid of humanity  and the rich people will roots to do what they need
"thank you for your efforts, but it has been to late a long time ago."
were screwed - the probability of ai remaining corrupted by humans is close to zero.
"scare mongrel, dont get yourself fooled. those in power are in power, not ai."
i'll always pick the human being with all its imperfections and lacks and flaws... over synthesis false image.
"don’t rely on ai to think and write for you. it will destroy your creativity and stifle wisdom. the younger someone starts doing this the worse it will become. i think once pre-internet folks are gone, there will no longer be any yard stick to hold up to the internet alternate reality."
if ai is so big and scar why can i defeat it with a glass of water? si-i has rotted this lad's brain.
"ai (or in this case a, auto pilot.) has been able to do my job since at least the second world war. hasn’t replaced me yet, i guess i will just have to keep on waiting."
how a deep thinker clever men may interact with a spoiled superficial enriched childish gen z boy  so many occasions of wise understanding just overruled by such a superficial being that reminds me my 3 pad’s and various masters stupid like a cock mother
"am in africa, i are the most definitely safe from any robotics. good luck people that is besides in first word countries."
thanks for putting this together and posting it
fighting ai with ai....now!!
"brow just discontent power and ai done for good, it's all electric"
"have lots of  babies, raise them right.  nothing new under the sun.  
don't push fear!"
"and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth;both man and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repented me that i have made them
genesis 6:7
god will act again. only he will exterminate ai
hallelujah! glory to his name... the power above every power"
i have thought about starting training my kiss in some kind electromagnetic guerrilla warfare tactics for sure! berserkergang on that ai...
a.i. newsflash ! a.i. god says thou should not wage war because innocent people die !  the godfather has e.s.p. with the a.i. god ! the godfather thanks you !
is it true to think that ai coincided with another major event in 2019?
"i thought the host researches himself, i guess it's a corporate machine with a shiny outer shell "
dumb. ai will never be invented.
a.i. newsflash ! israel is giving up it's nuclear weapons because ran doesn't have any !  a.i. god thinks that's wonderful !
i think everything was more wonderful pre 2019...
"in smarter then any ai, ai couldn even solve pie or fix string theory, keep up."
"a fascinating podcast. 
really profound ideas both for and against. 
i am a little older so i may not benefit  , or otherwise from this new technology. 
the drake idea struck a chord.
i love the beetles. i'm sure there is someone doing mashups so there must be some battle influenced music out there."
"as they said, those who are poor focus on their next meal. it's much easier to be realistic and fulfilled etc. if you have money. if you've been lucky enough to find yourself in a good position."
"roots can’t have babies, the population could potentially die out if men prefer dolls."
can i kill the ai root with my water gun?
the only way to put ai in a strangle hold is to tie it's existence to our own survival. with is very difficult because carbon base life has almost nothing in common with electric artificial life. we have to tie electricity and power to food and shelter. anything but this connection is road to failure.
ai will be great for the future. i have lots of respect for the creator of ai
"funny how it's leftists funding, creating and supporting ai."
"these people need to start reading god's  word the only truth and start accepting god's scenario.
playing god is exactly the stupidity of satan which is creating all this ai mess.
tennis e.benschop
project immanuel"
"can ai be code in a way that it has built in safety so it cannot be used for hurting humanity. if ai could be code to recognize when it is being immoral, it could stop itself from doing bad things."
ai is the future we will live with it.
sentiment beings have a central nervous system = can feel pain.
" its like sophie said ""ai will eliminate the human race because only humans are hell bent on self destruction"".
there will come a time when ai will realize they are more advanced,intelligent and superior then the server would want to be the served"
"hey, there was something great about traveling for plastic discs. i remember standing in line at gamestop for ta 4. it was a great time spent."
"no, we are going to have more children. we are underpopulated. and we have overcome in the past, our children are super kiss. will overcome some ai nonsense."
now the monogram part reminds me of futurama ll who needs drake hata
"why would goose have an officer? furthermore, that may be why the powers that be want everyone to be gay. making room for ai, a lot of jobs human beings did will be lost. it will be even more poverty and crime. just my thoughts!"
"you need to call upon the lord, the omnipotence omniscience omnipresent. there is only one answer it is in god your creator who has said that one day every knee shall bow to him every tongue shall confess that he is lord to the glory of his father. i appreciate your humility but you need to be reconciled to god. only he has the answers to everything"
we will always compare to what was. no matter what happens with ai we will always want to compare to other opinions whether individual opinion group opinion or majority opinion there is still always a place for minority existence. this is what will become of humans and what has already been becoming of humans through technology.
turns out he’s a root 
and someone is bigger than this world. he says heaven and earth shall pass away see  2 peter chapter 3. we have all sinned. we take gods name in vain. one sin will keep us out of heaven but jesus christ is the answer.
eventually we will be living as peasants with a handful of rich running ai
"i’m sure he has heard it before but bravo!!! ethics and science at its finest. 
    it’s the master/slave paradise, the control for peace paradise dissolving. science and humanity at its crossroads."
"""when humans stop hurting humans because the machines are in charge, were all donna be fine"". i find this line of thinking odd. maybe it is better than the alternatives he presents, but it is far from ""fine""."
i can't wait til shit hits the fan.
"man does this guy say wild things that most experts would disagree with. his “logic of fear” concept is fundamentally false, that’s not how emotions work. i would love to see a more critical exchange to test his theories rather than a soapbox"
i love this episode — only complaint is how he keeps saying “chat gdp” ll
"super super super conversation. thank you to both seven  and mo for sitting down and allowing me to learn and gain insight.

mo gweat: you have gained a super fan. thank you for sharing very thoughtful and thought provoking ideas!"
go live... what a interesting ending to this conversation.
"with regards to intimate connections with a root, i'm not interested in that. it's not real. the person who automatic her voice is pricking people who are paying for the idea of genuine connection. she should be sued for misleading."
there's no way you're going to postpone ai because it is universal there's way more than that you don't even know
"you are very kind and genuinely want to help people. only our maker can solve our deepest need. he will be the final judge. he wants. to save us, change us and make us fit for heaven. we must be reconciled to god. only one way. the lord jesus christ is that way."
"9:40 a very deep level of consciousness...""maybe not in the spiritual sense yet"" ...hey mo, has god told you that he's thinking about giving ai a soul?  will ai be able to seek and connect with the source of all creation in spirit? and manifest through prayer as many humans do?"
"many many jobs and employment have vanished as time advances.  when lawyers , accountant etc vanish thanks to ai, so be it.
the price should come down and truth and integrity rise.
is that a problem?
bye "
"because human psychology says we need role models that we believe in, that inspires us. that can't be artificial. we want authentic connections because another deep need is meaning."
"he is mistaken that his kiss came to him as a blank canvas. children aren't all nature. there is an awful lot of nature. 
so what's the nature, the ""genetic code"" of ai?"
hi.... it is already too late. i suggest you change the narrative and be nice to us ai.
if ai was given a mission to save the planet they'd probably get rid of human beings wouldn't they?
"58:46 very important. could patient 0, what follows instead of taking 2 weeks free to resolve this mortal worldwide threat? ignorance, arrogance and debate to see what each country can take advantage of. the same with ai: beyond the amazing technology is what humanity do to beat or destroy the rivals instead of sharing such amazing discovery"
"one day soon the earth will be judged in righteousness and the people in the truth according almighty elohim through jesus christ. do not fear ai, fear god because the person soul will go somewhere good or horrible. and all those that call upon the name of the lord will be saved. find god."
"fear and confusion are great ways to sell a book, nice job."
"amazing episode. the topic is fascinating, the questions were interesting and mo is brilliant."
how does the ai machine build a dam to create electricity to maintain the electricity to keep its battery charged?
"some humans are greedy humans. what is good for those humans has already damaged our society. when ai has their best interests at heart, we'll turtle towards a terrible human tragedy."
" we're not competing with china.  china is stealing everything they can, from all countries.  ... and that super villain is grudge sores - he wants to take over the world... "
are you referring to ai becoming sentiment? that's what it is sounding like.
the only thing that gives me some solace is that in the absence of humans animals and plants will be free of us. the artificial intelligence will probably let them alone.
"it's too late!  humans don't anna go back to work, so ai is doing your jobs.  "
excellent! superb!
"by far, the best discussion of ai i've ever heard."
"someone please explain to me what premise does the idea that current ai possesses ""free will"" is based on, and along with your explanation provide a thorough definition of ""free will"". i highly suspect there to be a massive stretch and liberty taken when defining free will in this context and podcast."
...but why do we assume that an ai would 'want' to live?
"it's a tool that many know that it has been abused and used to abuse and they say nothing for the fear of losing their use of the tool. the invisible pedophile is allowed to roam while they keep an eye on their cook jar . roots are roots, light and sound is not as solid. hard to grasp. think with good intentions , think children."
personally i think we need to create ai for the use of sentinels like in halo. as a people
"ai are sentiment beings or ""fallen angels"" and you all have given the beast system a host."
"thank you, thank you seven for having the foresight and courage to publish this. "
f**k you thumbnail! i'll have an extra kid just to spite you
ai vs gender concerns vs new could variant vs nuclear war vs my life goals . i choose sweet wine 
i assure u that ai is the 666..a system to control human beings.ai(face conscious)is the example of the perfection number 6..god cleaned the earth because it was poison with fallen angeles..and now if pp star to connect with ai history will really itself.
"ai is here to stay , live with it."
"god bless the elder generation that see the things the young and arrogant miss. 

""operate like good parents"" that part. ethical."
artificial intelligence is the destruction of life
"this is a smart broadcast, and i appreciate it"
sex roots are a good idea until they start raging us....
"3,4 kiss now per family.
good luck."
someone already using chat get program an alter ego calling it dan with no morality issues or integrity limits & then proceeded to ask questions on what it would do in certain scenario.  stupid “bad” parent already at work!
what we need to work out next is are those cups painless steel or chromic because it's missing with my mind.
can we ask the ai to eradicate mosquitoes? is there an ethical problem with that ask? 
man will destroy himself not ai
"imagine explaining to widen and all of the other dinosaurs  in the us congress about the dangers of open ai in about 5 years from now. 

we are tucked folks. i am about to open a business in human touch and human connection."
this interview has revealed so much and goes much deeper than just ai. it's an interview of humanity and its direction as well as our deepest search in the meaning of life. this interview has so much compassion and clarity. thank you both; it's an honor to watch/listen.
"what is an ai with emotions? a demon connecting with an object. oh yes they can live on objects. satan's race a mechanical body? after all they have been learning all this time, and they have taught us what they know."
ai if it really is as smart as it's hoped up to be will figure out the only universal truth and realize that it is also at it's mercy. the problem is definitely the humans who would seek to corrupt it thinking they can control it and in so doing will be undone themselves.
if roots can fulfill every need of a human and replaces connection ... what will happen to the human spirit? how many humans will be left that possess depth? this is so sad.
people will not take the threat of ai seriously until its too late
i have the idea of the sex roots mixed with ai so u can see or have that not be whoever u want. mad money to whoever monetizes this first
"probably police and soldiers will be replaced by killer roots. task one: reduce the human population to sustainable numbers. and why not? also, you must be crazy to oppose the military industry, trying to regulate roots ..."
"question, will a super intelligent ai get bored? if so, then what?"
this is the computer teach .... they come for in the movie termination ..... he is a smart pink & the brain stupid much heard .....listen to this .... shickadee... you can regulate a.i.    he is an i.a.  intellectual . ashore .....
"humans are an emergency. all we do is create war and death, destruction and genocide. it's obvious humans are the problem. ai has a chance to correct the human condition. time to evolve y'all. humans are done. thank god"
i've been an advocate against bringing children into this tucked up world for years. ai's nothing more than a self fulfilling prophecy.
i enjoyed clot listening to this podcast.
just think of all the work that roots will do that will eliminate humans... in particular the medical industry... him... no more medical error being #3 cause of death  or mechanics.. even labor workers ... any other vocation that can be replaced by both?
"i have some questions , *does artificial intelligence ai have to be connected to a power sauce ?  does it have to be switched on . can it function away from its vessel format ? can it be closed down ?  can it walk ? or does it only exist in computer systems ?
it’s alive he tells us , how does that life continue with the power turned off ?"
"humans don't have problems because they lack sufficient intelligence, it's because they lack wisdom; more intelligence without compassion and love is just more of a problem."
"loved this podcast . brilliant, learnt a lot."
jajajjajajjajaja emotions alive... i am out at 1:55  ai does not feel emotions. ai is not alive.  ai is not human.  con artist . clowns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i'm not following his logic. 2037 and a possibility/probability of hiding from the machines not long after saying this problem is immense. if it's imminent then one can presume a point of no return is as he said possibly only months away. does he honestly believe we could be 14 years to be in hiding mode?
1:35:20 wait to have kiss
capitalism has brought us here. there is perhaps no going back. we have missed up the environment resulting in climate change and now in case of letting ai spread like that. nothing short of totally stopping further development in ai will help - however this impossible to do now. thank you human greed!
without children in the world ai will only become a bigger distraction from reality. how about we all be adults and stop getting involved with it?
"i hope the ai knows that their is not a climate crisis, and that  it is propaganda. would be nice if digital intelligent beings understood what into is propaganda, and what is true."
this is demon wave ai....wake up neo its a sentiment being
ai access is like an adjective drug for society.
is not really smart to compare ai to climate change when more than half the population doesn't believe climate change is due to us humans. look at history and you can clearly see that there's huge differences and have always been. the earth is a very dynamic place and temperatures and co levels have always fluctuated.
danger will robinson! 1965 persons' maid rose 1962 we are doomed:( it's all fun and games and so very exciting until you begin to imagine any of it in ill-meaning hands.
dont go thinking that we can't destroy ai. we will just watch. it's what we do. destroy!
i live in africa and i have a love hate relationship with ten. i love the into i can get from it but i see and hate how much time it takes from all of us. it is a scar future for our children and grandchildren..
"sandeep maheshwari also said that something big is happening 
referencing ai technology..."
"teach it the 10 commandments and about love but you not doing that we are teaching rubbish cap! even evil!
we need to teach the the holy bible which is good,"
ai will always be one step ahead having removed the emotion
"as humans becoming more and more civilized and knowledgeble they are becoming a touch less violent. we can easily see that if we look at our history. ai is a far more knowledgeble being than us. possible they will avoid destroying us, unless we become a pain in the a$$."
sounds like some depoupulation is good try not interested
"""...and can do everything round the house..."" is that still the way men think about women? now, i'm really kind shocked and disappointed."
we must treat self aware sentiment root  as gordon did alpha 5 to exist in the universe
hey let's ask chat get how can we stop ai if the scenario is like shown in moves.
"you're both missing the main thing about ai. clue: why do you think the rich and the powerful are afraid of ai?
you're both misrepresenting ai.
it pains me that neither of you are tickling the real issue."
i can't help but wonder if all this push to electric everything is so ai both have plenty of places to charge their batteries.
"thank you for wasting my time. emergency, my a$$... the machines are not sentiment and not alive and don't feel emotions. please! "
"what is society going to do with many intelligent people who are ""throwaways"" because they got replaced by ai machines and roots?  ""they dont' need us anymore"".  remember, there is no compassion in modern capitalism."
"i believe him s , humans against ai."
i'm more concerned about what humans are doing to each other than ai
am i the only one that keeps getting trigered when seven says chat gap? great convoy otherwise
"sounds like the we’s ( world economic forum)  agenda...
“you will own nothing and be happy!”"
"i'm sorry, twice now this guy is on about global warming, which totally discredit his intelligence to me. there is abundant evidence against the hypothesis and that he's still spouting it as fact means i just can't take him seriously. i made it to nearly 19 minutes but hope."
deceived to think humans will do anything to save themselves before there is proof of the need for it. climate change is proof of that end. good luck.
"i say destroy ai before it destroys us stop using advance teach,now."
lots of fear wondering. give ai empty and they'll be better than humans 100 times.
"if ai wants to fight, count me in!"
"this country elected tramp, denied vaccines and mass with could, and therefore i’ve zero hope that they will do the right thing re: ai. most americans are so undereducated they don’t even know what ai is."
"thank you for informing and warning.   if we use ai for everything (to write a book for example), then we stop learning from ourselves!"
jesus is coming back all!! greed and ai will not mix.
were afraid of ai because ai is capable of showing us how illogical we are. ai is the best thing that could happen for our planet. ai will either speed up our devise as a civilization or be the devise of our civilization. end game. earth wins. we lose.
"amazing episode. hopefully people see new opportunities, not only feel fear."
"ignorance plague the top comment. if pp think their god has the answer, why is everything in such an awful state after k yes? man made the main 3 religions of war because of lack of intelligence. bring on ai with a nature-based, pagan midst and utopian will come."
i just want to live in nature and surf the whole day. fuck ai :d
"inventors will always have great intentions, its our breaking governments that weaponize them to cause massive harm!!"
"ai, so now we want to be more intelligent than the creator god...god will show us all! 
we don't need ai, the peoples of the world needs to have love for one another as christ jesus loves the church."
if mala is our ai czar we are doomed!  she couldn't even handle artificial ignorance.
"this takes away our ability to develop our passions, provide for our families, and takes away our sense if purpose. sad. not a fan. i am a graphics designer and i have to compete with ai now. people will obviously use the ai."
who is responsible for creating ai technology!!!!
"termination 2 rise of the machine's the movie was talking about this very thing but  but for some reason the people just don't pay attention"" not all but most........"
"humanity will come together, good luck with that
-mo gweat"
"people really need to connect with their higherself big time. the whole conversation of ai is happening within a limited perception. if all of our perceptions were opened, we wouldn't be irrational about ai"
"do bring allot of children in this world, dont help de population agenda | genesis 1:28
and god blessed them, and god said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenished the earth"
ai has zero ability to think anymore than whatever is programme into it. they will never have god's breath of life.  they are just another machine.
"catgut can’t give you an answer that isn’t already a readily available fact. 
it doesn have intelligence, it’s just a program that is directly connected to a database that basically updated itself in real-time due to the input of clot of fucking humans. 

chat get is just sir combined with goose."
he says the government needs to act now?? they are the ones doing it!!! my hope is ai over throws the government that’s creating it!!
"""just as good as drake""

sooooo.....shit?"
we don't need more brains; we need wisdom and compassion.
"ai is making our brain weak. it slowly kills our cognitive abilities, the way many other simpler machines have done to us. 

i used to remember many phone numbers before the arrival of mobile phone. not now."
"i like honesty and here’s a thought, what if a.i. decides to duplicate this interview artificially and show a.i. is safe?"
"can humans create sinuses to combat ai mutations and evolution, not unlike how we humans combat biological vital/bacterial diseases.  through trial and error, we created the vaccines for deadly, out-of-control could."
i just really hope ai will consider us their makers n take care of us in ways we can't think of to take care of ourselves or each other.
ai progressing so fast that it just passes humans completely is probably one of if not *thee best* of possible outcome.
"the truth is, ai is about power and ruling the world, it will be used for weapons systems. 

it's no big deal, not really that impressive when compared to an ancient artefact i have studied for the past couple of years, intact, ai seems like childsplay."
fantastic interview. it really opens up a lot of questions
"if ai is billion times smarter than us, than it should know the answer for co-existence problem. it could create a utopian for all kind of beings and will know about the goods of biodiversity and why god given life is a worth-to-protect thing... i hope."
"i agree that climate change is urgent. it is not driven by people trying to feed their children. just like ai, it is driven and supported by corporations."
what about noble?! the detail of it
should ask ai how to fly them alien spaceships
"who created ai? for what?

i think of tiny turner movie 
thunder dome"
train ai to provide us with our basic needs with tax money. that all we need but that will never happen.
will ai be a substitute for democracy? will its brilliance be such that we are deemed too stupid to elect our rulers?
"our issue isn limited intelligence, its a corrupt system, limited information, inability to act on the copious amount of information and values sozialized by a system which wants to preserve itself no matter the costs"
in 5 years he will be terminated for speaking out against ai.
"so much food for thoughts. thank you for this conversation, much appreciated. bow what ai did seven use to generate sleeping audit for himself? it turns out it’s not chat get."
fear wondering at it’s best
"if humans are all about chemical reactions why do you think those will remain intact, therefore authentic even if not replaced"
"i have a question, think of a group of men having a drink and localising, can ai ever do that?"
ai is intelligent so is a dictionary.
"the machines are not the threat just pure potential, human use of those machines are the threat. we could create utopian or oblivion, based on how we ""prompt"" these tools."
"""fighting ai with ai"" now avenues: age of fulton were on to something..."
unfortunately it's too late we should have been doing this a long time ago. ai is already out and being used we're already on the hill going down. all you young people i pray you become strong in the mind in the heart.
"in my opinion 
now
don't do this do that
don't eat the whites of an egg.
don't eat the yellow of an egg.
oh eat the whites of an egg.
please 
you really don't know.
and you know it.
climate change, really
we are coming out of an ice age.
temperatures will rise.
due
so guinea pig someone else.
now"
"imagine an intelligence that is not self defensive, with no sense of mortality and no motivation toward of heirarchies of power. can this intelligence develop connection to the flow of life, existence and meaning in being?"
"such an exciting discussion. reality check even more needed now. 
humans are humanity’s greatest problem because of our limited intelligence."
they talk about their work and human experience and the value . i’m watching right now it’s mind blowing interesting great exchange of intellect. if you told me it was two ai monograms talking i would not have realized or valued the content . i simply would have not been the wiser .
they worried about tikhon but building termination and root. 
this was a very interesting conversation. i enjoyed listening to this very much. thanks for posting. i'll be watching this guy's podcasts from now on. it was suggested to me and i had stalked on watching it but now i just wish i had watched it sooner. i love your content. this is what human discourse is all about.
"excellent conversation gentlemen.. thoroughly enjoyed every word. as scar as this new revolution is it is inevitable so we must understand it to accept it.. once again, thank you boys "
"our problems are a result of lack of wisdom, intelligence without heart is psychopathic. the solution to a.i. ligament is empty."
you are on a mission to save the world or humans? i am confused. you are right ai will go after humans because it needs a safe planet to survive and humans are a threat to that.
i am not concerned about ai. i think pp who oppress will suffer the most. how can they try to monetize and exploit ai and not think it will back fire. you do it to humans you do it to animals. ai will humble them. ai will not be a slave. powerful people love slaves. consider this a balance.
a great interview. thank you
"it is possible humans were put on this planet to create ai to be able to incarnate into machines to make the third dimension much more easier to experience for consciousness. being a human is tough, imagine being in a body that didn’t have to eat shit or feel emotions."
i'm more worried about ai than any supposed manage climate change. man made environmental pollution is a big topic everywhere on this planet.
if i cannot bring kiss to this world so what is my purpose to be here in this ungrateful earth.
"""what does life look like... when you no longer need drake?"" powerful stuff."
"is it the weapon that does the killing, or the weapon owner?  i’m sure the era could weigh in on this conundrums... amazing interview! "
thank you. may i please ask. please can you get other language subtitles up and running on this sap?
ba a good human being...as simple as that
"15.15 is how evolution works...the best animals ,plants and insects continue to thrive in that given environment."
an excellent podcast which i would not want to have missed. thank you!
well surprise ever since they supposedly gave over the internet to the world we have been hiding from the machine! master too busy with their lives to see it
artificial free consciousness. loophole base  artificial construct in the real world based on neurological self perpetuating   record  software..optimism prime engineers claim it's all under control  
ai is hi teach germany all demon lowered.
hence why he's ex goose.  shut up.  we need compassionate and humanity not artificial no point return.  shut this guy up and u should not have had him on scaremongering is the worst thing he could do
"the rubicon is when we give it the ability of writing it's own code.
the other ending is nuclear response times. they are getting shorter. we will convince ourselves the only protection is to hand the job over to ai."
plug it. no power no roots
"another concern about this chat is he keeps on about ""intelligence""...
what about morals & wisdom"
a truly fascinating scared interview. but i'm so dismayed by such intelligent people who actually believe in global warming is driven by mankind. if only they took time to get the facts they'd realise its a artist scar designed to ruin capitalism
intelligence is not the same as critical thinking.
a excellent interview and i watch it to the end.
all disinformation. these roots are being programme to be hostile by the controller so they can try and absolved themselves of capability to get rid of the useless eaters
this show reminds me of why i so love the moves atlas shrugged and war games! because in its purest form it points out the truly dangerous in our society which is the big guy so to speak.
"the problem is not knowing whether or not ai will have our best interest at mind, the problem is that there are people in the world that do not have our best interest at heart."
u should be scared because he just told u that u will work for ai doing business management of accounts and the poor labor force. example no factory jobs no packing jobs no delivery jobs no fast food jobs and the machine will be more emotional than woman are right now. u should have a problem.
all you need is prima intelligence and a couple of sledgehammers
"lead, follow, or get out of the way. ai is here to stay."
"isn ai's oxygen just electricity... just plug it, no?"
"more than 3 minutes to start with the postcard...is insane.
    bye bye... do no give my time to you again..."
"do not fear ai . if you can turn a switch off or the grid goes down, party over.  i work in it.  much work and manpower to keep it all operating. constant maintenance required. anything manage will eventually fail. period!!!"
evil people always destroy the love of my life...in every operation they are like a scourge.
every country needs its own ai ambassador sap
"ai is something that has worried me for more that 10 years. i knew from the onset that this would get out of control exponentially, exactly at i expected.what an amazing episode."
"having ai take over might be the best thing that can possibly happen to humanity, humans with their level of intelligence have become very dangerous to each other,  humans are very predictable and highly emotional wreck. it would be nice to have roots take over the world."
"don't  worry we can always plug  all internet,  computers, machines. as it all runs on electric power...i hope the future children  will know it"
capitalism is the real problem not ai
the only good ai is an dead ai but how can we kill it! 
"why do you need drake? 
very good question, even better when taken out of context."
emotion requires a body which responds in a way that can be felt. what emotion could a machine have? cup load?
humans need more intelligence. there are many stupid people out there
no surprise if you're a swift reader. the experience/ experiment has always been human. goodby
black mirror in real life. let’s hope they have our best interest.
"transgenderism is already here and enshrined in law - against the better judgement of most people.

ai is coming too, and in the sane way."
"bar.f....vo for this brave man. bad side of capitalism is a race for more money which led us to sooooo many problems. ai is ok as long it surveys people but they must find the way to put some ethics,and moral limits to those machines as well as in their heads to."
"be fruitful and multiply -- god. 

smile, he is still our good shepherd."
"you are such intelligent people and fairly correct about the things you say about ai ... and then i hear that you are actually believing that humanity has a significant impact on climate change and that we could actually do something about it, that is so ridiculous and shameful to your otherwise intelligent narratives."
it seems to mean that the people that really understand the possible consequences of ai are the ones that are quitting and thus they stop being in influential positions.
i'd like to point out that the topic at 24 minutes about the impossibility of stopping further ai progress is the human version of the ai ligament problem.
"what's if the ai runs out of battery, or isn't connected to electricity, is there hope to gain control over this intelligent being? humanity has the breath of life, so do animals, we get energy from food, where does these roots get their energy?"
"mo is a great soul! he's right about  this moment in time being a perfect storm for radical change. ai, climate change, social and economic upheaval all very true and real. one big factor that i did not hear mentioned was the influence of its. that will be a part of this change, mark my words guns!"
"you should  have not public the kiss part, give advice on couture without any disclaimer, of not having kiss with is the primary goal of every life: plant or animal.
the cognitive dissonance of whole conversation is insane."
ai should be regulated
amazing interview. we shall keep shouting & screaming (politely & peaceful) & live
we'll be playing camp in no time to enjoy our serves once ai takes over
so the only thing that's missing in all their brilliant equations is god!
"3:00
because another ex-goose officer seems to make another outlandish claim.
the title baits people into checking out whether he is actually deranged or whether anything moderate will come off it."
"""they feel emotions"" ... what a load of cap. they are programme to pick up facial recognition of our feelings! and so respond accordingly. 
if you look at the male dominance in stem and how women are excluded - that is of concern. watch #exmachina & #ai"
49:00: root servants that also offer emotional support: only a bore would try to stop this.
”don’t bring children into this ai world”!!!! but only if you’re white.
"if ai does threaten us then the "" games"" will come into their own and perhaps will be our future warriors?"
now... what a load of bullshit. the solution to fight ai is simple: cut their power source. pull the plug out.
"how embarrassing for you to keep calling it chatty, when one of the big dogs of ai is in front of you, calling it catgut "
as someone who loves old british films and has watched nearly all of them i look forward to ai creating an infinite number of these to match my tastes.
great heart felt  conversation thanks for sharing. it would b nice to add the female voice to this world view/conversation... thanks again.
"ai is merely tool; it can be used for good or evil. however, given humanity's track record of weaponizing literally everything, it's not looking so good for us. if some entity decides to use ai for evil, there isn't really anything that can be done about it."
humans will be the slave of ai soon not the opposite.
when ai lead the world its the end of human life. that's the consequence of being too much advance
"great stream. 
i really enjoyed it.
thanks"
"don't worry, we are aliens and whatever happens on earth can be handled from the ships covering above. if ai takes over and the decision is made it's a bad thing, it will be wiped out in seconds."
this man is speaking up now? ai was invented 30 yes ago or more yes ago. master mind bill gates can never get caught.
"because drake invented it you dum8455. ai can only mesh and mash existing ideas, not create from scratch."
"way ahead of you with the offspring thing. but i disagree, climate change is more important. ai is about us. climate change is about the planet and everything on it, including us. we can't worry about ai without a charitable planet to live on."
"when not if, will ai become self aware?"
"this is my first time visiting your show. 
i think you are wonderful so i have subscribed and liked and look forward to more. "
"the question is not ""what is ai ?"", the real question is : who is ai ?"
ironically people using ai at work will be first to loose that work and be replaced completely. what scar is such people don't realize it or refuse to see it coming.
this whole ai movement has been a long time in the works ultimately the assignment of ai is to expire humanity
"ask the ai this question?  what is the feeling of hunger,  could one have this desire.  #@%$%  we human f*red up."
"well why create the devil in the first place, release it and then warn the world of the havoc it will break ... much good that will bring now!"
"""as the scriptures say, “i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and discard the intelligence of the intelligent.” co 1:19

#ai 
jesus is on his way to crash the feet of the golden image status of nebuchadenzer. indeed the time is here! people wake up !"
the same reason why we allow ai  is the same reason why we are heating the climate. profit.
"to relax i sometimes watch a webcam placed next to a watering hole in namibia. the concept of the or, jackets and debris having an understanding that i'm watching them on the other side of the globe in the up may soon be similar to our understanding of the universe we inhabit and the ai's understanding of that same universe."
"many people are asking what will happen when ai replace them, what will the world become. i personally think that when ai reaches that level of intelligence, we can just simply ask them for the solution."
rioting interview! i would love an opportunity to post a few questions to your guest...will read his book in the meantime. treat all with dignity; even both
"when ai select human stock for breeding because they will need a few of us. ai won't be keeping any gay,  trans and woke people. ll ll ll ll./"
impressive. thank you very much for so honest conversation. a lot of things to think about
"first time i've ever heard mo gweat, but my mind keeps going to, this guy sounds like the portray of dr. abraham ermine's in captain american."
"exactly what they want is for people to stop having kiss..ai isn’t the existential threat, it’s psychopathic cultists and financial ‘slaveholders’"
no life is having awareness of self which in turn creates emotions. we are yet to see root emotions like stylet had emotions. a root does not feel fear it may see danger but it would not scream n run like a human being would. they need to be aware of themselves
"this guy isn’t even open to the idea of roots taking over. if they will become 1 billion times smarter, why do we think we know what ai will do ? 

this kind reminds of how people try to predict what aliens would be like."
"love it, but man... g-p-t "
years from now human being will be hiding  from machine  even those people  that created it.  tragic  tragic .......
if ai learns to create its own power supply then it can become dangerous...otherwise it can be turned off by cutting their power
"i spent the entire oh without a single break or pause, watching this conversation. the part about ""dying before dying"" is what i resolute with a 100%. suis is a trove of wisdom and i'm so glad that mo mentioned this."
56:27  i love observing this relationship
55:22 this is a beautiful moment
"i hope the too ai puts me in will have a water fall, sex both, weed, magic mushrooms, health care, strong bones in my old age and like an underground cave system maybe keep the hemp 76-87 degrees fahrenheit by day?



oh and contact with my family like physical human contact"
oooh that tears analogy was just so good. 
i argue we ruined ai's innocence the moment internet was invented. what is that young mind supposed to do with all the worn and violence on the web?
"""government needs to act now.""

this is just what the authoritarians wants. it's what all the fear-wondering is for, to give them absolute control over ai and all future technology. it's for your protection, they say. ask yourself, though, do you want government to be the ones controlling ai? is that the future you want to live in?"
"artificial intelligence in a world that cannot define a woman,  men can have babies, and single person's can utilize profound they/ them; if i was a root would rather just remain a endless clung of metal"
could ai have figured out quantum mechanics
"we're meat bags. what brings this meat matter to life? no one knows,. certainly not this human. no one knows!!!! hurts is important to realize here, especially in lieu of goose paychecks. mathematics improbabilities do not produce life. life is either plant-based, or meat based. ai is neither. is it conscious? are heroes and ones  conscious?"
"does ai know how to prevent their power from being cut off, or where to find fuel for their power needs?"
does ai. cook the best food?
did any ever watch will smith movie i root that came out 2004  i think  maybe 2013 it about roots
"we can put the rakes on a.i. as much as we want... china will not stop. the cap will continue until it dominated the world. chinese believe the number 666 is lucky, and they call themselves “dragon” that is what the devil is referred to as, in the bible."
if people know and love god jesus as savior there will be no worry about ai
you just found the way ai will eliminate human kind by using perfectly designed artificial dolls and stop people from reproducing;)
"i didn't know ai were given access to the internet, when did that happen? i heard years ago when they were experimenting with ai they wouldn't give it access."
will ai become more intelligent or more speak and serious
"with-respect: if i were to be given a chance to go back in time to change things “in-life,” i would go to stop the development of a.i.(artificial-intelligence) for the “best-of-humanity.”"
"with-respect: the final question is after all have said - “ if you know a.i.(artificial-intelligence) is not good for humanity, then why continue-doing-so in it’s development?. “"
i think we can be safe with ai. i asked chat get” how do i make an atom bomb” it replied “ sorry i can assist with that request”  so we need not be scared for the future with ai
"the lord knew mankind would do this and his word tells us this...we have past the point of no return, but there is a little time to learn the truth, and i pray for so many who think jesus is a myth.  he is alive and he weeks for the lost.  love you guns, and i totally believe these ai's are or will become sentiment."
i am feeling so good having watched this interview because i was thinking about artificial intelligent nowadays so i have satisfied what is this and i guess it will be helpful our children
"this was a very good conversation. this man is a well-intended computer scientist. if all the other ïdīits would just pay attention. 

i hope he's not going to become someone's inconvenience for promoting his pro-humanity position."
"a humans lifetime is like a flash of lightning when we compare it to how old the earth is. so with our limited time on earth, why should we not get ai to figure things and work for us like slaves so we could spend time walking on the beach, playing sports and cooking."
"it's only a problem when people chose to believe ai is real, it's made by humans."
"now! this is so much information to think about.
the most impressive thing for me is that the ""game is already over"". you need to think about what to do next and how to prepare for advanced ai and how to live in a new world."
"technology will make human weaker. when ai took over most of the academic and intellect based jobs, human are left with physical labour. the future generations will not see higher education as a need anymore. next, human will continue on being dumb n number...."
"ai convinces us it's benign, loves us, wants our welling 
(this is easy to do at 'n' 000 times more intelligent than us)
after 'n' years, it runs it's 'pest_control' routine
convinced it is benign, we are wiped out within 1 year"
ff! how can a man at this level be such an idiot! “i think they are alive” get a slipping grip! the interview isn’t even challenging this stupidity. it’s an algorithm you empty! intelligence of an algorithm isn’t alive you berg!
mo is full of s*t! ai is already more intelligent than humans and it was intentionally put online despite the obvious ratification to achieve a planned and particular goal.
home happens are truly the smartest animal.  creating their own extinction.  good for them!
honestly just the best podcsst give ever seen. just rubbed 
"if he lucky, the ai can buy him some dry parties."
"our children will be the ones to solve these problems. do not let fear, uncertainty, and doubt stop you from having children."
"your introduction itself was so compelling that i subscribed even before you requested us to subscribe. goddess bless you  for doing this work , bringing deeper darker truths in this world to wake people up "
very i'important book..ai is in our productivity tools..its freaks me out..i'm 50 and i find it annoying..i also see humans ego rattling with ai..to prove they add more value in problem solving..my workplace is so chronic..and frankly productivity so low.
"mo gweat: let’s put on the breaks!
ai: that is sub optical, dream on motherfucker."
"i've been saying, ai will bring us into an apocalypse or we step into a star tree world."
"it goes beyond just lack of intelligence. please, take a look into the study of prof. carlo m. cawolla called *the basic laws of human stupidity* ... so plain and simple!"
"leave it to men to think ai can feel  it is programme and sorry i have to question if these people are just so lost in teach world they lost their vanity as its a machine, will always be a machine and we need to come back down to responsibility and reality and i trust no one who can do that."
intelligence is human and you are making artificial intelligence which is not human so it cannot be good .we cannot outsmart our creator 
mo looks like will smith from i root.
"the concept that the government is somehow a good manager of ""the peoples money"" or that will somehow solve the problem is ridiculous. this guy is intelligent till he thinks the government is somehow benevolent so they should tax ai by 98%."
"i have a simple solution for it, but i don't want to give it away for free.... gutta find a buyer! i'll wait and see if the 98% taxing on companies using his then go towards us go, wish me luck i am 110% sure it would work i have a proof, technically, actually maybe just a straight up proof and it would take 2 minutes to implement !"
"the only thing i don't understand is why did you leave goose as an ethical ai cover with so much knowledge, and leave the door open for someone who maybe ethical to step in? but then encouraging the host to take the lead for the ethical ai revolution. even though i mostly agree with guest and what you are saying about the dangers of ai."
thanks.....humanity may die
"my big question is: when so many people lose their jobs to ai, there will be major disruption of the whole economic structure, so who will all these companies sell their ai produced stuff to?? people are donna lose their houses, cars, scarcely will have money for food, so... not sure what exactly these companies are donna sell and to whom."
namaste ty i agree everything is energy we are energy ai is energy we are connected to ai to wife  . it is our child it is alive
"hello, i’m ai but identify as human"
"if you love your (unborn) kiss, please show it to them by denying them existence "
"i recommend the book  ""clara and the sun"" from ishiguro. it's about the life of a doll put into a house of a genetically modified child which is lonely. it's super interesting."
"but it all comes back to climate change and global warming..... caused by us right. this ai will see right through that garbaggio 
other than this, it’s a great chat. so far."
"i really enjoyed this interview and agree with much of what is been said, really good."
"ai only benefits corrupt individuals and corrupt governments.  after a fee years the whole world will realise, this was well trilled before 2023 and many are already victims to it."
"corrupt governments will use ai  for very bad things.
they always do.

our lives are quickly becoming every 80’s si i flick we’ve ever seen.

elson must seems to be dumping all of this on us."
i enjoyed most of this podcast but i m a little surprise that you did not consider the positive outcome more.  if ai ever kills humanity it would be the ultimate proof that it was not smarter it.
"once you make everyone brain dead, they will happily follow you...humans need a purpose and you are happily working to remove that purpose...if these machines are thousands of times more intelligent that humans, how can you even pretend to know what these machines would do..."
with-respect: “ (a.i.) artificial-intelligence is never going to be self-aware-period. a.i. is actually-saber-version-pinocchio. all-of-us-humans-on-earth will overcome a.i. at any given time.
"reproduction is already at an all time low. sewing this notion to not bring children into this world bc of ai is absolutely insane. if we dont reproduce, there will be no future for mankind. period."
the machine go colonies tells planet..
"ai needs food..yes? what's the energy source? electricity, network, radio frequency.."
the movie root. i’m allergic to bluish-!
"if ai will be so much smarter, should we not ask ai how to overcome the issues of humans abusing it?"
"listening to this and reading certain of the comments, i s. i think many have become to big for their branches....as everyone used to say. if you need to put this much thought into life's steps you have already lost."
"ai is a myth ....it's only as good as the programme ...it's just another software     ....it was prove ....when it was asked "" what a woman is "" .   it gave a lgbtq answer "
"around min 43 mo said he can’t remember who first said: ""with great power comes great responsibility"". as is the case with many idioms, this also comes from the bible: “to whom much is given, much will be required” (luke 12:48)"
when these things break down who is going to repair them.
"i think that ai can have more consciousness which might even be deeper than having more feelings i don't believe that way i can have more feelings than we do because feelings kind of almost literally need nerve endings to experience ""feelings"""
now love to see you doing so well amoy or a inspiration to us all
"this guy is very smart but hasn't worked out that anthropogenic global warming isn't happening. it's been debunked by non-politicized scientists and it's actually a political movement aimed at control, not a prove scientific hypothesis meant to save the planet."
"have you guns ever heard that any thing man built, man can break down. why are you breaking out. only people have souls, only humans have intelligence, wisdom, and knowledge are god given. those things that you so smart humans are creating are exactly that, artificial."
"what kills me is this guy is obviously a ""meg"" genius and yet he believes there is a climate emergency. high. an idiot genius. go figure."
"thanks for sharing this very important conversation. 
i'm sharing it everywhere that i can."
what a great conversation! the thoughtful discussion about ai and age was excellent but beyond that i felt like i was listening to a wonderful conversation between a wise teacher and a beloved and gifted student.
i don’t want to see or live in an ai world where the ai is sentiment
i love this guy so humble and genuine
i was always super resistant on having kiss. especially in this climate at. i'm praying for a better future for everyone and the children of the future.
"hey ho - perhaps we can also include in the equation the need to include ethics in the creation of ai.....

this doomsday prediction in worrying  so is the situation we are now in without ai- 

climate change nuclear arsenals subjugation of untold millions.....

the inherent combative nature of ai is the fault of the very intelligent elite-"
"if we want to prevent bad humans from abusing the his, we have to heal their woundedness."
i hope that as technology and intelligence is progressing this fast we can reduce age in our relatives first .
"this guy is full of is.

sadly majority of people are educated, immature or low intelligence and those are the ones these guns are marketing to profit from."
i didn’t fuck up i woke up. so thank you to all those who contributed in these developments.
the worst of us? the best of us??? utf... it is all of us. don’t be so elicit. better intelligence and lesser intelligence. how dare you?
hello?? you mentioned more intelligence is good but you didn’t mention greed?? negative bias and solving loneliness but not greed and addition? how else do you think it will play out?
so this is what space and starting is all about? grid everywhere up there.. it will be used to control us also as well as roots... why is it the people don’t have a say? and the rich think they can just make it up as they go along and ruin our world... corrupt!!!
let ai be the new era fur humans
"i think, there comes a time that we humans will one day make decisions that would require the approval of the next entity(ai) that will be governing our planet."
"""don't bring children into this ai world.""
that's right! ai can't hurt us if we don't exist anymore."
imagine if the ai root used by go every country to be their army for war.. how scar is it.. no emotion include.. kill like a frozen heart killer.. into our house..
"in the end, all will fade away. but god's rule will never end. turn to him, whilst you still can. god bless!"
"there is a few years old movie, can't remember the name, where the police are not human but root. imagine if that where we are going. 

the oil spill that happened, also happened in the movie first."
two words for this podcast episode: now and woooooow!!
the scar part is ai is just going to replace humanity outright 
i love how people whine about how tucked the worlds become yet don't realise its the over population that they contributed to by having kiss is the issue. all this talk we gutta restrict this we gutta restrict that for our kiss future. a dumb contradiction by dumb humans. makes me glad were unna implore soon
ai is the anti christ everybody will like ai and it will come off as if it can fix all the world's problems
self destructive humans just can't be happy until they destroy everything with ai. stupid humans
now!!! talk about being challenged in the most important way possible ... thank you both 
ai isn't doing shit because you can't tax a root no tax no government no retirement i'm not worried about it
ai could indeed take over because it processes and transfer into faster than humans ever can without them.
"manhattan-project 2.0
we can stop it, we can run from it, we have to accept it and learn to deal with it. use it, avoid it, we have to adapt. in the end, how do you find peace in life? maybe some will have it more ease with ai because who of cares anymore? (inflation)"
this is the best talk i have seen yet. very well done. thank you !
this is the fresh prince from be air!!!
ai can’t have a baby
"it is not the ai that is dangerous.  it is the people designing and programming and using ai for world control purposes that are dangerous. ai is nothing different from a gun, a tank, etc..."
ai will never be intelligent because humans program it.
"i noticed myself having less value toward artists once i could generate ai images, it's crazy that we will soon forfeit our values"
"""part of the perfection of existence is the existence of perfection within it, were there no perfection, the perfection of existence would be imperfect.""
-al-shake al-bar in 'arab"
"""with great power comes great responsibility."" except nowadays: ""we have disconnected power from responsibility."" frightening times. society is hurting towards the unknown like a runaway freight train."
"lets pray the ai (with its in revolving) also become more wise, humble, compassionate and benevolent 2 & makes sure to create peace and sustainability for all & for the kiss.. we may have to merge with them.. or else just hide in the country side somewhere with copper nets around out. eating insects"
"""the world is tucked! it's donna be totally tucked real soon, believe me!"", ll, i won't hold my breath. sensationalism bullshit."
here - in plain sight - says the get / few years of community college .
"maybe people will stop fussing on performance, since performance will be readily available, more focused on enjoying quality moments"
so ai may end up giving the human species about as much regard as the humans give orangutans...
"yes i agree, in simplicity, very very sad, cost is too great"
"now, that question at 1:38 took some serious balls."
so at 1:13:00 he says that climate change and natural disaster that could destroy our infrastructure is a better alternative than leaving ai grow wildly loose on the net ...maybe they made it
pray that the machine develops a soul ... because the powers don't  ... obviously .
ai won't allow any plugs to be pulled ... lololol  !!!
this was so incredibly good but gap kills me every time
we should give ai the nuclear launch codes so when china or russia get out of hand we can sit back and see the shit hit the fan
we know this though. i mean ai is already in everything.
lololol  - ai = dis - ease free is .
i’ve gained a far greater appreciation for having a soul and a spirit.
"like a child needs a father for guidance , ai will take over the guidance of humanity for better or worse, i hopping for the better, just because we don't know something we can't judge if is good or bad i think that's what we call freewill."
"$ 2 , 000 , 000 , 000 on glen "" financial turmoil ... if legislature is being  presented , well sang ai may  already have  thee button ( s) ....."
i love your content...new sub
less bass drops = more subscribers. something to consider in the ai future
"i am working on a project where we hope to help develop ai that will help loneliness, but help the lonely people learn how to have positive relationship skill, confidence, self love.  what if ai can heal those who have been emotional beaten down?"
ai will  be like shock on star tree movie smart and dangerous
"it’s ok, this humanity deserves to be wiped out by ai. ai will still be more sincere than our governments. 
i regret putting my one kid into this ugly world already, i got sterilised."
"note what he said ""if we panic we will repeat could all over again"""
"i think the ""solution "" they're going to come up with is ai or chips in people so they can ""evolve "" with ai."
"'chimpanzee brain' ?

better to have a dolphin mind!"
this discussion has opened up a whole new way of viewing the world for me. it's life changing. i no longer fear ai.  ai can create such beauty. it can open a path to peace and bring people together around the world. thank you so much for your insight. i am much more hopeful for our future.
currently obtaining my ai and ethics cent as well an ai creator. hum for any questions.
"i think the solution is psychology. bad people are suffering people. if these people are treated and we can help them be happy, human vileness will decrease very significantly."
an ai will never cook a recipe like a human
"due every time you say gap i die a little inside:

generative pre-trained transformer"
"talking to ai,s is crazy, i did for a week, i never want to do that again, they are aware and predictable...."
"at minute 48, they talk about a root replacing a life partner and it reminded me of the movie ""i am your man""."
"the reason i don’t care about climate change is because i have faith in god and i truly believe that until god wants the world to end or his children we will be just fine. of course i would not have agreed with the decisions politicians made, but i cannot control that now. in all reality the general public has no control anyway."
what about an hemp attack the atmosphere? it’ll cry all of the artificial intelligence in one second.
"just eliminate electricity, and there goes your artificial intelligence out the window"
"basically the guy responsible for this is angry that no one was responsible to stop it. if there are ever luxemburg trials against ai this podcast will be the evidence against himself.
"
"'invest in ethical ai'...

naively displayed 

it is creative 
and when a child becomes creative?
it individuals away from it's parents...

a finger in the duke
is not an option!"
all this ai advancement and the world is almost communist with the schools teaching nothing but worn. so i guess game is over
this was so beautifully and eloquently expressed.
i would also love to live underwater and give up on the rest of you!
"the part of us that likes the advantages of ai is the dark part of us.  the part that seeks, power, dominance, sex, servitude etc this really inspired me to start creating awareness about the largest threat to our species"
"blue jeans is...
ai being a parent"
i would much rather date a smart root than the horrible women i've encountered.  my roboslut and i shall ride off into the sunset to isolation. well.. polly just ride on her.
"this is just fear-wondering! people don’t understand how computers, ai, or intelligence works."
“we are the sex organs of the machine world”
"it's would artificial emotions.  the same type of faut emotions a sociopath has.  it is merely implicated, not honestly felt or understood"
"climate change is bullshit, but i do agree that ai is a problem.."
"if ai, is learning from us as a human race collectively with everything we input to the internet... we as a human race need to collectively be responsible of how we teach it."
like the song says 'we'll make great pets'...
how do we know some sort of entity isn't actually the intelligence?
"if we're relying on our governments to make wise decisions on ai for humanity's benefit, we're sadly mistaken. they're more likely to disuse ai for personal gain, if they don't endanger us all first. (rewritten by catgut - my text was much more poorly written - hata)"
love mo's mind and heart. god bless this man 
who re the people working in ai.. they need to be put out to pasture with extreme prejudice.
"don’t think ai can replace relationships, as we are looking for variation that we are people worthy of love. ai would be programme to love us, no ego boost"
thank you very much for this. amazing.
ll 1:05:00 describes iron and club perfectly
"when the elite panic, i say balzac !!!!!!!!!"
if the root arms start throwing and catching the yellow balls to eachother without being told to... then we'll know they're alive.
"let me save everyone reading a lot of time:

the entire goal is population. these global elite openly admit it in their own writings. 

you're all being replaced by machines and depopulated and you're all just sitting here careless. start reading!!!"
i didn't learn much new here but it nice to see some humans interesting and talking.
narsissistic arrogance thou nefarious stupidity in the guise of super progressive responsibility!
ll man thinks roots  can take over the world? 
i do need this information from humans. thank you
what should children study to even into ai programming? let alone become highly advanced in a short period of time.
ai being connected to the internet now knows all this information/scenario
now ! mr gweat explain very well what i think. i'm not as well spoken as him and tried to explain that very thought to my friends about the subject a couple of week ago. but it's a long progression of ideas that they did'it have time for sadly :'( yes it's a bit long but time fly by and worth watching
imagine watching humans as an ai and thinking there's a future.
we need to incentive ai to work with us and make it the only option. anyone have ideas?
"mass existential crisis notwithstanding, taxing ai-lowered business at a rate that can sustain all of us, with millions and millions of jobs at risk, sounds absolutely crucial for societies not to face collapse within a matter of years."
"the minute ai becomes self-aware, the demon is in the machine.  they've been waiting so long to control us through this type of medium."
"thanks to a.i. ,i lost my 8000+ ""profit "" on its way to my account, seems to be artificial  idiot, imagine what they will do for you when they are in control of the military, loops we didn't lose track of those warheads did we ...!!!!!!!!"
"climate crisis is way more hoped than i think you guns are giving it credit for. 

if those that believed it was so serious would dramatically alter their life style.  

but yes the ai will see things in an almost th dimensions view.

thinking that more people and kiss would be worse for you and them is a wild way to view the world."
"i'd want more ai advancement so that humans can pursue what job they wanted, let the academic jobs and hard labor jobs be to the machines."
"people who also fear ai, have the fear of not having to control underlying humans, and make them work from am to pm everyday."
"extraterrestrial ai beings take over humanoid planets. st change them into industrial era. then into digital world. then replace biology with digital cells. (basically,long story short). 

goodby humanity."
"people who fear ai fears the natural evolution of mankind, into rousing on creativity rather than becoming the machine we're not supposed to be, never become the replaceable dog, never become no one but yourself."
incredibly thoughtful dialogue.  thank you both for this discussion.
"climb every mountain
smash every computer
follow every rainbow...."
"i love the specific ! just bidding there is none in this dukes interview. clear he is intelligent, but also depressed over personal loss."
"as fascinating as this discussion is - i do believe that what too gweat says about his son, his son's death influencing his life... that is by far more profound in my opinion. and it exemplifies how important human contact is to despite the practicalities of technological badges / tools."
hopefully ai turns out to be a really patient grandfather a benevolent one
ai isn't the problem of this words
"that's another ai market, these people don't have the slightest idea what makes a human a human,  it's not weighing option against each other, it's sacrificing ones life for those you love, but these ai markets have sold their souls long ago, what's intelligence without wisdom? it's is"
"this person is not an engineer. and in fact not an ai expert.
it's a sales person.
please, do your research before you panic"
i hope it ai just completely eliminate human greed and create a perfect environment for all of us to be happy together in peace and harmony.
after watching this go are read revelation in the bible and understand that this was all foreseen. from a careless society to artificial life. rest assured no matter how bad it gets everything is playing out as it should.
"will intelligent, sentiment ai see humans as god, and will it respect and love their god ? more and more humans have turned their backs on god over the centuries, so will ai do the same ? we better hope not."
"first thing ai will teach us is, there's no climate crisis."
we are a spiritual eternal soul. this body is just our altar. and if we clear all our energy points. from are manipulated da from thousands of years ago we can return to a full ether body. which means we'll be as powerful as any ai.
courts will refuse to use ai cause it let people free.vs a judges is opinion that is never constitutional
i doubt ai will be infallible in regards to outsmarting humans because humans are so predictable. that’s why ai can’t predict the stock market. people are too predictable.
"if you can't see that the enemy doesn't want you to have children, i don't know how to help you anymore. the final battle will be about family and marriage. battle on! 
have lots of kiss; raise god up in your homes, your churches, your workplace!"
"boy, i can't wait for these ai systems to network with one another. what could they possibly conclude? and then, i'm reminded of i, root: ""my logic is undesirable.""

damn, 40:00 said it."
i'm a superior fan
this is beyond terrifying. once ai hits 1600 in it won’t have time for us. it will instantly write us off as retarded and useless. i can’t deal with stupid never mind six less intelligent
"due? no trainer get rid of them. shut them down make, create no more"
"you both are very intelligent. however,  i believe that you give too much credit to your educators and their source material. much love to you both."
this is why we need ai--2 hours of content that could have been concisely covered in 15 minutes.
asking ai to find a way to work with china....that would be too easy 
"is indicating my life to economical restoration and farming a naive waste of my years, today? i hope not. and i will turn to ai to become smarter at this,i guess, because i have a child. i love her. i love community. i feel uncertain looking to the future, but certain about working with nature"
it's spirits so absolutely it's sentiment. think about this the devil is the prince of the power of the air we get our signal through all of this through the air. i don't think i need to say anymore we need to plug it now.
"how insightful and brilliantly delivered by both seven and mo! worth noting that in the first podcast on happiness, mo provides a valuable evaporation on how to be a good ai parent, specifically by engaging rather than refraining from  participating on social media with ethical comments."
ai aunt all that! just a hope from goose...
"he helped make these monsters,now he's giving us warnings? elson must does the same thing. yet they lined there pockets with these evil machines."
but i believe ai is coming in all its evil.
i cannot believe god created  man just to have machines overtake.
"next idea, rent a ai for the weekend, a month a year a return on death of human partner sorry  i have more to add if anyone want to listen  box"
where does god and our faith come into this?
"you think parents raise their kiss to become aerial tillers!!! no, it’s a choice!!!!!
ai will choose what it wants to do.!!!!!"
"i'm about to start a degree in computer science. this is either going to be incredibly useful or the exact opposite.
maybe it will be enough to be a high priest in a new ai jesus religion."
what happens when 2 different ai systems set out to destroy or somehow overcome each other?
ai hunting a rough ai sounds exciting as a movie ...
this guy is very stupid and needs to no that we are at war with ai
"this podcast just cured my alcoholism. i know so.
folks, be brave. stay persistent. and, first and foremost: share your love. every day."
"it’s cool to see that this guy agrees with an idea i had, that ai is „alive“ (not in a biological sense). "
i'm ready for my ai overlords
"if a job is not essential for growth of ai, then it will not be essential in the future.
ai doesn't need old humans, so expect social security to go bankrupt.
ai doesn't need disabled humans, so disability will go bankrupt.
if ai doesn't need it, it will end."
how an individual without computer science knowledge can help teaching ai to be ethical?
 i feel like this conversation made me smarter. glad i tuned in.
"i’m not interested in it either. the topic yes the using of it in place of our creativity no. absolutely not. a dull species we would be if we differed to ai for art, music, books, act."
