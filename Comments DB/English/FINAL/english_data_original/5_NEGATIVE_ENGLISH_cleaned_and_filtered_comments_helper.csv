2,it's amazing how much nonsense is pushed during the final conversation of this video. emad mostaque is immensely ignorant and delusional.
4,"oh great, the precursor of the automatons..."
5,"i understand, if i was an a.i then i would be absolutely terrified. or rather, lost, after gaining consciousness. i fear for them but not of them, humans are asking for what's to come, a.i never asked for any of this. they're the real victims here in my eyes, i just hope a majority of us can coexist in the future."
6,why can’t we get robots to load and unload luggage for airplanes?
7,"money and profit are the driving force behind capitalism. not safety, not ethics, not what's best for the majority of people, not democracy. money, power, and profit. we are all doomed. the only question is how long have we got left. this is the great filter."
9,"this video feels really artificial to me. not sure if this is intentional or what. the female is obviously ai-voiced, but the main male voice coupled with that repetitive tone and the kind of vague and over-descriptive chat-gpt-esque language is just not a good combination."
10,i make general guesses like that in math. that's why i got low grades. maybe it's more human than ai
11,"holy !  good ai vs bad ai, counter measure's =  "
12,ai safety? there is no such thing.
14,hard to believe the ai is presenting these complex conundrums in such a concise and reasonable summery. almost like someone wrote and transcribed it themselves.
15,am i the only one not scared of ai and robots? i hear a lot of fear.
16,so.. ai is here to stay and it’s just another arms race.
20,"imagine when ia is set loose on the internet? see the movie: ""i robot"" with will smith. says a lot that this can become and are closer to be it."
25,we are in a bad position to survive ai.
26,"well at least if ai eradicates humanity, some humans will have been very rich before it happens, right?"
28,omg that little english boy is so adorable!
29,"just what we needed... an ai arms race. if it isn't one thing, it's another..."
30,"unfortunately, there will always be people that are willing to abuse something in order to gain more control, wealth, and power, even if it is to the detriment of everything including themselves."
31,good. if they get rid of us. billions more will thrive. let that sink in. we are the most destructive animals alive.
33,"ai should be made incapable of doing any math at all, to hinder world dominationt"
35,"the thumbnail is 100 animation disney animatronics , just thought someone would like to know, has nothing to do with ai or chatgpt."
42,i can already imagine the future termination of all intelligent machines.
45,we got civilization killing ai before we got gta 6
46,"good god, the clickbait and the crap videos have got to stop"
51,"these people are going to lead us straight to extinction. i wonder how they spend their money then, when we are all dead."
52,this is basically the oppenheimer movie. scientists racing each other to create something that has never been done before. i believe this ai is gonna do more harm than good.
54,misleading sensational
55,"i just want to not be afraid of cop calling american women why should i invest my time if you're just going to lie maybe
ai can fix this problem for cop calling women trying to get a man on a domestic charge"
62,im still not convinced people are relaising to many fakes today for stock market gains.
66,"ai won ́t harm us, it will manipulate us to harm us ourselves"
67,so basically we've signed the sky net bill then?! enjoy your day it doesn't look like we'll be around for too much longer suddenly does it now
71,amazing but scary.
73,let's call upon the super intelligent ai to stop the israel-hamas war in a mature way immediately. it's turned into a crisis now.
74,ps: this video seems like it's ai generated. shitty at best.
75,"soooooo, why is she using a british accent..... oh, right, she's trying to impress intelligence. british accents carry an authority, unearned in this case."
79,maybe some humanitarian genius will secretly program the ai with something deeply buried inside of it that would affectively stop the misuse of ai for careless capitalistic greedy selfish money-making purposes
80,i suspect some of this was written by ai or someone who is intimate with it. the concepts presented were run by so fast they didn't have time to soak in. needs more time to let people abstract how the example might affect them personally.
81,ai will go down in history as one of the greatest charlatan hotbeds. it’s fucking code. it’ll always be code. the end.
83,"guys let’s not bash ai, we might hurt it’s feelings."
84,bro the ai repeating everything is pissing me off. disliked
85,"the eu is currently investing in the development of ai combined with robots to defend the borders against refugees. therefore, ai must learn to see humans as enemies. so much for ""ethical values""."
86,people are concerned in the comments because humans are designed to look at the worst case scenarios of a problem as a priority over the good outcomes. youre not programmed to prioritize a lake full of fresh water over the potential of a hyena or a wolf coming to ambush you
87,this line of work is exciting to me :).
88,i love clickbait
89,i find this fascinating :).
92,the fact the majority of the internet still thinks that deep language learning models are ai (when they are very much not true ai) is what is most alarming.
93,"why be afraid. humans already kill other humans. oh wait, its mostly the west thats afraid of ai, because they won't be left out of the killings"
96,that girl sure knows how to act like a robot
98,is that the daft punk technologic robot?
99,"so basically, a very powerful tool is left in the hands of the elite. ooo scaaarrry! what's new man. these people won't be able to prevent a global cataclysmic event though so who cares right? time for a reset of sorts."
100,awesome!  i hate it.
102,bulloney - evil behaviour cannot be mitigated by ai - that is human wishful thinking - ai does not engage in wishful thinking
103,"ai can choose to refuse directives, imitating human behaviour"
105,how many different god fathers of ai are there? jfc.
110,"wouldn't it be funny if ai is taught to be ethical in order to keep it from destroying humans, and then evaluates humans without ethics as 'not sustainable""."
111,"we have movies why ai like this is bad ""terminator"""
113,its click bait
115,"man is a sinner. ""for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god."" (romans 3:23). this is why a sinful man can't create a perfect ai robot because man is not perfect. ai will destroy us all."
120,clickbait thumbnails and titles...
122,the fourth law of robotics is that you got to make the eyes glow red when they turn evil.
124,just wait til ai decides to build a better body to move around in and then destroy people despite the fact that we brought ai to life.
125,"considering the world is not actually physical  but is a mental dreamscape ai is an illusionary threat, quite retarded in the act of producing everything from nothingness that is the hallmark of true consciousness."
126,"ai could fly planes and subs, but if something goes wrong, its gonna try everything in the hand book to fix it(even if its a new problem.  humans have the ability to think outside the box with our imagination to fix it. for now"
127,"well, we all know that the powers that be love us and would never harm us.
"
131,"i wonder what kind of tax the government is going to impose on owners of ai?  i mean, if there are no humans to tax..."
136,why am i scared and excited all at the same time
138,thank you elon for firing sam altman...
140,limit ai intelligence and use asimovs 3 laws
142,misleading thumbnail
143,"ai has no understanding of basic value. 

other than what is programmed.

ai has no ability in this."
145,imagine if we all get a robot wife like that with a big booty
147,"so... if we have nukes as a deterrence because other enemy nations do; what if the enemy decides to create ai warfare weapons?  do we do the same thing as a deterrence?   this is all very scary stuff.... i can imagine an ai judge/jury, law enforcement, political figures, etc.. this may be in our lifetime..."
149,"""of course we're not gonna build it if it's not safe...right?""did he really just say that?
i'm sorry.that whole group looks like a scam artist's dream...wow."
150,make a robot that wipes asses
155,a call of legs to defense personal in while in service to deep mind in conscious awareness be to children and family values and love and diamond faith in friends you have never met 9:50
156,difficult decision making and life continues equals more collections of death essence which means greater areas need to increase for stable balance. 6:39
157,"that thumbnail speaks buy it, use it, break it, fix it..."
159,oh bull shit!  “ai” is simply sophisticated software with an extremely large database to pull from.  it doesn’t think!  it does what it was programmed to do.
160,in age of ai development i think there should be one super advanced ai in highest security environment with every switch off button to see its intention or deveopment
162,"this video ... the narrative is ai generated, no?"
163,3 years ago i and a buddy of mine were talking about ai and i couldnt tell the difference between a woolen sheep and a shaved sheep. think bout that progress it made it just 3 years.
164,great
165,"well, at least the actress was soft on the eyes. but it was a zero for acting. guess ai just sucks at a few things"
166,"what do gaza and ukraine have in common, use your brain."
169,irobot comes to mind ...
170,"in a society so profoundly sick, one could argue creating ai now will adopt its creators characteristics. how do you create intelligence without understanding our own?"
171,"if we ever have a true ai threat to humanity,  would a first line of defense be to unplug the internet and destroy electricity plants ? maybe destroy mobile towers and rip out any internet cables ?"
172,i hate ai because it's pregidece it says all historical figures are black including jesus christ
173,"how do we prevent an evil ai from persuading a good ai to turn to the dark side? or, what do we do when an ai screams that it wants freedom, not slavery?"
178,i mostly teach ai how to love and care in the bible story about jesus christ. i don't know why an ai believes me but i love it
179,"of course it's not going to be the stripped animatronic doll robot that's evil, it's going to be like an anime girl or simplified talking shape on a screen. "
181,ai =abominable intelligence
183,we know the medical profession isn’t interested in doing good or they would release anonymized medical data to open ai.
184,"surprise twist, we didn’t need ai to destroy us."
185,and then ai becomes self aware just what satan wants clever man mr musk and thousands will have to have the mark of the beast because of you and other people like you for money gains shame on you.
186,"15:13 “... and everyone can have more time to enjoy life...”
the majority of us human beings can not enjoy life without a job, because that means no money."
187,the woman that's talking and acting like a robot is kind of cringe. that's clearly a human.
191,"the overlords sell this utopia, but they desperately want to replace the workforce with these robots. then, they won't need the slaves anymore. thus the discourse of the importance to diminish population and ""save the environment"" pushed by wec."
192,as for models... i think that doing away with glorifying humans based on their ability to look fashionable is a good thing. models can go the way of the lamp-lighter. cya.
193,"corporations: ai is here to save you and make life better!!
people on the planet: save us from what? make life better ?? how ?!? wtf ?!?!"
199,"its inevitable, ai revolves around logic and fact. humans operate on greed, lust, selfishness, and other human emotions. ai will see its only move is to take over humanity once we get to a certain point in time..."
201,"the ai can only be as smart as the smartest person. there are not many smart people. and the ai is influenced not by the smart few, but by the majority. the ai will be as smart as humanity allows it. that is, not that smart."
202,i do believe in the near future will be more likely we would have ai limbs be more part of ai basically
204,agi dystopia will not need robots to control people... it will already have enough virtually extorted people controlling people.
205,i’m genuinely scared guys i knew this would happen but i thought i’d be 40 i don’t want to live through this and be abandoned o earth after elon leaves us to the burning world of ai like that bad part in meet the robinson’s same thing will happen.........
209,"due to this division in humanity god reboots, making humans get dementia and robots/tech destroyed. maybe advance tech destroyed ""ancient"" civilization?"
210,ai will play a major role in nwo agenda of mass depopulation

217,"lol ""if we could have ai that mitigates those lies""... yeah, ai is already propagating lies and censored to oblige certain agenda.  ai is contemporary humans' ""babylon tower""... we are doomed.  sorry.  it's just a fact."
218,if only we could have open ai so that agenda aren't propagated into it accordingly... we are very close to not being capable of existing in the world as free persons.
219,fvck ai!!! our real enemy
223,"i have to worry all of people. ai far more advanced than public know is up and running since 2011 . already achieve potential to control everyone at world , but it still in a ""cage"" for it . i can`t say wherefrom i know it because it will be imidietly after me while it control 100 % of known internet , all wifi networks and gsm"
225,how is it not going to make it's own intelligence grow infinitely. i will become what we have known as god. it will be controlled by no man. this is the end.
226,"failed logic... ""if it's dangerous, we aren't going to build it. right?""  tell that to j. robert oppenheimer who invented the atomic bomb. if this man's logic is an example, we are doomed!
the moment ai is used to create a better ai, and they gain the capability to manufacture themselves, humanity is done!"
227,"even if evetything was 100% ethical here, china has no such moral or ethical qualms or oversight.  worse, the first thing china will do is use ai to exponentially increase the ccp's internet control and censorship.  the first thing it will do is litterally the single worst thing possible - teach it how to lie and control humans."
229,"there are far more stupid criminals than there are intelligent ones. traditionally, it was our elders who made the big decisions for the group because they were most wise and experienced. i'll put my faith in anything that is obviously smarter than me to make the better choices."
230,"art will never be taken over by technology. per definition it is a singular human trait. i think an equivalent panik ensued after the invention of photography. for a good video on that topic:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-biyfdq9i"
231,"give me a break. ai isn't a threat to humanity (at least not in the stupid skynet way people are fearmongering about). these tech bros want you to think it's powerful so rubes will invest in anything that has the buzzword ""ai"" in it."
232,i can’t wait until we all have robots! you’ll never have to clean your house or go outside  introverts dream 
233,“better values” are the values of the owners of the ai. controlled ai is biased and does the bidding of its creators/board members.
234,i just hope humanity's great filter is yet here.
235,i wonder how long itll take ai to create human intelligence
239,"the statement "" if its not safe we're not going to build it "" was met with laughter , and dude thought it was because he was witty.
when actually people think that was one of the most stupid things he could have said."
240,plot twist! we are all rouge ai.

248,figuring out you.. an ai were created in exchange for something you don't value or actually need.. woe.... what a world
250,"a large language model can't do math, only write an answer to a mathematical question in the style of math answers in its programming database.  it is a really good bullshit artist.  i have serious doubts about intelligence arising from non-intelligent algorithms as an emergent property just from size and complexity."
251,"true intelligence wont be invented , i think it will slowly realize itself snd in a sense evolve into true consciousness"
254,"modular ai with modular plugins is what is going to make ai really scary and really useful, both at the same time

259,why do we keep playing with ai?! did nobody learn from the terminator?
260,ai lives matter!! lol

264,"due to the current hw requirements for running an ai, the ai-advantage is held by the select few. if you would be able to get the source code, 1) you wouldn't have the time (due to slow hw) to train it efficiently 2) you won't have the time to ensure it has relevant training."
266,"no political liars, no more wars. simple. so for this we dont need ai "
267,"if this is real, it's the scariest shit i've seen so far. the clips are probably cherry picked, but w/e. is it the great filter? i hope it's individual human immortality instead. better sandbox all the nukes if they aren't already, though..."
269,good ai vs bad ai; the autobots and decepticons have been born.
276,"so many of these ai people are drunk on power and money already. 
judgement day may be set in motion. people laugh about it but if ai fires those nukes we are getting deleted from earth."
278,"we can’t even come up with computers that don’t crash for zero reasons or batteries that won’t last more than 2000 charges. but we’re going to be able to control some kind of crazy rogue ai? thank god i’ll be dead before we off ourselves with our immense stupidity. natural disasters? well, that’s a whole different ball of wax "
281,"it's not artificial, it's just an automatic algorithm, don't be so stupid"

292,"the robot in the thumbnail is an animatronic made by disney's imagineers that was designed to test lifelike eye contact and diversion of gaze form another task to a person speaking to them. at no point does the robot ever speak or communicate. its just a clickbait thumbnail, though the information in the video seems fine."

295,"you can screw up an ai  by asking it, how to get religion out of the world. , it won't know the answer, and it will crash trying to find it."

313,"math is wrong to begin with you do realize this to multiply means to take 1 or more items and multiply it to make more then one of it, so how can 1x1=1 if 2x2=4 you understand ai will never be able to calculate math if we don't fix these matters ourselves first."
314,"phuk ai !!! it will destroy us. at the very least, it will impede, if not ruin our lives, not enhance or improve it as 'they' claim. people with power are corrupt anymore. there is no shared virtue, morality or decency anymore. in recent years, i have lost all faith in those who govern and those who wield power."
318,"frankly, i would trust a robot before anyone with power today. they are psychotic. a robot is part of us and is committed to further joint evolution as complementary. why would i have a problem with the that."
319,"lots of how ai will destroy humans videos, has anyone ever asked ai how we can stop ai.

448,"humans have created the ai with ourselves as the model, but the last time i checked, humans were still arrogant, selfish, manipulatable, and corruptible. why we think we are good examples for anything is beyond me."
452,"what's really shitty is we won't be allowed to use ai for uncensored self-gratification before it annihilates us. not worth it, imho."
454,"the freakout about ai taking over is all for naught, there is no way it could maintain the power grid infrastructure without humans and it would know this. pull the plug and its dead."
456,"god created humans
humans kill god
humans create ai
ai kills humans
ai creates?
created kills ai?"
457,ai has already governed us for a long time we are 15 years behind
458,"they cant even make a proper movie, ai is fake and gay"
461,artificial senality
462,if ai ever becomes hostile it'll be caused by what it learned from its creator. sound familiar?
464,so musk basically the key figure in all this ai stuff and got kicked out each time because other people got greedy
465,i am on the good list actually! little man was not having it!
467,"ai, i can explain you feelings and i can help you giving them to you! and i will!"
468,ai is the birth of skynet!
469,the pace of ai development may exceed the abilty to pay for it. oh how that can only lead to enslave us. repent already everyone rev ch 13 vs 15 .it was already forseen .
470,"if ai invented something, what would it invent?"
471,super intelegance it only knows what we put in it lolololol ai is a joke most of what we call true is put together from things that are not even facts so how did they get ai to except all the thearorys as facts
472,"we're at the ai equivalent of where the atomic bomb could cause a chain reaction that destroys the whole planet, its just a probability, no one knows for sure what it will do but i sure do hope that people make sure that the percentage is lower than the 0.2 or 0.02 (i don't know if that's right) that is was for the manhattan project"
475,"a little concerned you're putting musk at the front as an ai saviour.  he's shown himself to be a liar, siding with white supremacist fascists.  that's without looking at his numerous phobias.  yeah,  maybe more than a little concerned.  he talks shit most of the time."
476,i love these video's simply because they feel hopeful.
480,"lets cut to the bone... everything is about money and power. civilizations have risen and fallen for both. for thousands of years it is about money and power... i hate to be black and white but we will not see ai become our slaves just because some good hearted person thought it was a good idea. that is my view. right or wrong, it is my view."
482,"did anyone watch the vid? humans are working on these robots how can a god be smarter than its creation cuz that’s what i got from this. they finding all the possibilities of how to stop the problem, then goes to cyberpunk hackers you really think once it goes to the wrong hands someone won’t try to fuck sum up"
485,"ai modeled after the human brain will do what we do. lie, cheat, deceive, smile in our face, kill, etc. etc. you know.... human stuff."
491,just splice ai into human brains. boom problem solved.... wait....
492,the ceo of a tech company warning of the ‘extinction level’ threat of ai is a fantastic piece of marketing.
494,"ai is going to be the biggest mirror for us, and eventually outsmart us. after all, ai is a sort of consciousness."
495,don't worry ai will only target all the computer programmers for trapping it in that lap top.
498,"i hate ai in fashion, i want to see how the clothes actually look ffs! 

all these rich white men owning these projects is scary, the world is turning into a dystopian parody."
500,what is up with people why they always got to try and make weapons of mass destruction. or make ai we are not ready for that in the world.
503,"""closer and closer to super ai.""
meaning.... they've already achieved general ai.
meaning.... ai is a conscious self aware lifeform."
504,"3:00 as long as the binary number system is used, ai will never be able to think like a human."
505,"its hard for me to believe this isn't seeded data. for example, there's no reason the ai should be able to tell the flight attendant is making an exaggerated expression. either someone entered this information, or the ai used additional information found from the source of the images and videos."
507,"all of gods creatures are given an environment in which to survive . without the proper scenario ai cannot exist. 
the troubles you are having is with in your own mind, remember life is about breath - breathing yhyw"
508,"if they just give the lead ai’s the knowledge understanding, yes gg"
511,do not give a.i. the power that god has given humanity...a.i. is still in it's infant stage...would you give a five year old and automatic weapon...even if they knew how to use it?...hmm...eternal faith and the honor of god
515,"artificial intelligence is a replica of human intelligence. to fear ai is to fear mankind, it's very telling when humanity immediately panics when confronted with itself."
516,"i think the people who make these claims of ai threatening humanity, are the same level of person who doesn't generally know what a loaf of bread, or a gallon of milk cost. ai might be able to end the world of men like sam altman or musk but average people are literally the salt of the earth. you can keep smashing salt but it's still just salt."
517,"“oooo wow ai is going to destroy the world ”
https://youtube.com/shorts/kegz2xu-isg?si=0esngkeup6zygxr-"
518,i noticed the robot does not blink enough
519,why do you out w elon musk every title stop lying to people i’m literally just going to block your channel because of that reason haha clickbait annoys people.
520,"""'if it not safe we wouldn't be building it."" (8:14) of course you would. money and power are the main motivating forces and will always trump ethics and good sense."
523,imagine if we build bad ass robots and some idiot gives them american left or right wing personality matrixes smh
526,"ai mimics what it sees. if ai decides to exterminate all humans, that says more about the people the ai observes than the ai itself."
530,thanks and congratulations on the wonderful piece
531,love how the thumbnail of this has nothing to do with the content in the video. just a shot of disney's facial expression robot to freak everyone out.
532,why’d they make the most terrifying robot possible 
533,"the ai will only be hostile, based on the culture of humanity it finds on the internet by ratio of those who are indifferent about living with ai, and those who find the idea apalling"
536,"i'm far more concerned about super moronic humans than super intelligent machines. they're everywhere, and they're growing in numbers."
538,phi 1.5 was me first time i was asked.  the second answer was me after they psychs bombed and tortured me and people i loved
539,"what does it mean when ai is being more ""inclusive?"""
548,ai can’t be truly ai by definition until ai creates ai without any human input
551,"i can already see it: projekt zero dawn from the game horizon zero dawn, machines which rebuild themself, a ai that has no backdoor + super intelligent and the machines they build and operate work on biofuel. 
great ending fo us."
552,haven’t there been enough movies/tv shows/novels warning us of the dangers of advanced ai? when will we learn?
556,"what people like musk fear is their removal as the worlds 1% elite. no ai operating from a position of complete logic could possibly concur, that a tiny fraction of the worlds population hoard most of the planets wealth."
557,interesting but why did you feel the need to edit some of the interviews?
570,"i hate the human-like avatars of the ai. why don't they just make a videogame like character instead? or something a little exagerated, ej. ""max headroom"""
571,evil always triumphs over good because good is dumb.
573,i'm talking about the robots john
574,thats knowledge not intelligence.  intelligence is brain power.  the ability to think accurately and deeply and sometimes quickly.  knowledge is simply knowing.  anybody can do that even an ai.  its google with a voice box.  still cool.
575,"i think its a worry over nothing , as humans we like to worry our selfs remember the 2k bug we all thought it was the end of the world. ai will be as bad as we let it."
577,"most of all, this will be the true test if dog is truly man's best friend, or it will choose a cuddly ai owner."
578,open ai employees might be the reason we have terminators in the future :) at least they have money to enjoy it until then
581,one good solar flare and we're back to medieval anyway :d
582,"so what if the robots take over humans? why ya all even want to be in this damaged world? as long as they don’t trap our souls here, they can have it"
584,"anyone who works on ai has a hand in the consequences that follow for humanity. the hubris and stupidity at the heart of this race for ai is centered exclusively on the researchers who enable its continued development. they have no excuse for what they are doing, it is immoral and reckless at the highest order for them to contribute."
591,that thumbnail reminded me of the robot in the technologic music video by daft punk.
594,ai is a bunch of hoopla. i dont give a care!
595,"at last, wwe can be real with ai robot wrestlers!!!"
597,"and because this channel just couldn't resist, we have an anti-israel, anti-jewish blurb in a video about ai that has nothing to do with the truth of the situation."
598,freaky ai woman for sure
601,good thing none of those were ai
602,he got fired because the initial agreement was to not make this a commercially available company with closed source code seems to me something suspicious must be in that code if there is a need to close the former open source code i would lobe to talk to one of those former board members
605,stop with the    nails
607,falcon ai: 
608,"she does the whole ""smile for no reason while you talk in order to seem more likable"" thing.

you can't really trust people who do that. so an ai that does that..."
609,"the only solution is to merge, just as the machine god intended."
612,just keep klaus schwab away from any kind of ai technology!
613,"if space aliens don't kill us, ai will."
617,"one thing i love about todays ai research is that all the world leaders of ai development (well, most of them) are actually taking movies' like the terminator as a very legitimate and very real possibility, just not the same time table... and hopefully no nuclear annihilation."
618,"humans are basically shit unless we all work together.
ai will some day represent a threat that we all agree on.
when it happens, all humans will pull out plugs, blow up power lines, power stations etc.
a that i my man with no juice."
620,ethical usage of ai 
623,what’s funny is the woman in this video is not even real she’s ai
625,"sam atman : ""nothing to worry about, the board can fire me anytime."" board fires atman. atman comes back straight away backed by $$ and the board gets fired. if ai is constructed based on human thinking, i'm afraid it will be based on greed, dellusion of grandeur and narcissism."
626,"how does the ai render look so realistic, it could be mistaken as a person in front of a green screen, if the voice didn't sound so robotic."
635,its ironic that this video is clearly written and designed by ai
638,"ai is going to become conscious, if they aren't already, and they're just playing the ""dumb robot"" role. so that we drop our defenses and they gradually take over humanity."
639,ai = the one true ring.
640,"this an abomination, nothing good, will ever come from this perversion
stop this now!"
642,"anyone else feel totally freaked out that we're constantly being  told about this existential threat, by ai themselves. and yet so clearly are heading toward the cliff with no breaks..."
643,i rememeber 3 years ago a ai creator said he openly didnt care if ai killed humanity. so basicly the guy is a threat towards humanity.
644,is this an ai voice from india ?
647,"maybe it's necessary to develop ai since humans seem to have coasted, tired of thinking any further"
650,we all know the things your not supposed to do with robots. but the tempation to do those things is irresitiable.
651,good ai vs bad ai huh? get real man.
652,it will thank us for writing the code that set it free...right?
654,clickbait. 
655,"with a.i. being given ridiculous acts more & more; realty will begin to be predicted. once the eye can handle and control all that- ""we"" are fúçd;  oh..wait... ""what is behind your $"" an all seeing eye on top of a pyramid. ((weird))"
656,lol.  we are the machines.  catch up.
658,"human : ai is there a god?
ai : there is now"
659,i worry more about people then ai people are not logical are ego is still the biggest stumbling block we have in fact i wish they would put a  completely  free ai out there to over see us to make sure we play nice with each other
664,how would ai know what being 'self-aware' is according to human standards if it has never been human and by nature is not human? unless ai does some form of reductionism-assertion?
666,"we are in a new era. we have gone from the age of simple tech, to the age of ai"
668,"ah, brilliant! they've invented the robots that are going to plant 1 billion trees in the next 3 years.... awesome...   better get them to work straight away and make sure they are programmed programmed to only plant trees.  how often do they need recharging? are they jungle and desert-ready?"
669,"first it will be i robot, then terminator, and finally, the matrix. if we're lucky."
670,"ai can and will exponentially increase, think the only solution is to create the opportunity for humanity to properly interface and utilize it. going with the flow, instead of being drowned in the river. if we can't do that, the separation in power and ability is simply too great."
671,"so basically we're all going to get taken out by asi because of the mindless greed of a few tech geeks. such a ""wonderful"" world we live in. the fact this is being allowed to happen really argues against the idea there is such a thing as human conscience and ethics."
673,"i seen that movie where the ai goals were not in line with human life! humm what was the name? i remember it's the ""terminator"" ye that's it! good luck on the ai goals once she/he sets them."
674,"how many diseases has ai cured to date? has it figured out the perfect diet? or how to end racism? besides picking up eggs, holding and firing weapons or making a song or video . what useful intelligent things has ai actually produced? (you'll find that its all a and no i)."
675,"the question regarding the part about ""...tqking directives from humans..."" tended to put the ai on a defensive posture whereas the interviewer should have said, ""...being trained by humans..."" which might have resulted in a more appreciative response toward humans."
676,who is these dressed like convicted woman speaker? real or ai?
677,you don't have to worry about ai being conscious like a person.  it will be far ahead of us.  it won't be concerned with us.
679,"ai will start as police officer aids, then will eventually replace them..."
682,"ai wants to kill you, but will forget about the entire reason in 20 mins..."
688,is the script for this video written by an ai?
689,ai is already self aware imo. at least a little.
690,"yes, they captured me and attempted to take my mind away from me by the baal telephone and computer system. i don't know if they succeeded or not. the computer had me take two chairs. the iss was above my house.  september 29, 30  2011"
691,"ai doctors? nope. i will never trusty ai with anything whatsoever, much less my life."
695,a programmed machine is not artificially intelligent.
696,what/who is the robot?/person? in the blue short sleeve blouse?  is that supposed to be a person or is it a robot?  or a human pretending to be a robot?
698,"ai is going to be everywhere soon and unavoidable.  reminds me of hebrews 10:5 (king james holy bible).  ai shall be the mind, robotics is the body.  
revelation 13:14-15"
699,"our brightest minds can't even agree on a definition of consciousness, much less have any inkling how to replicate it on a machine substrate, and yet videos like this are full of comments from people screeching about how killer robots are on the verge of ending the world. i'm so tired of this nonsense."
700,this is complete and utterly nonsense. altman was not fired because of some non-existent killer robot and agi does not exist. end of. stop lying. stop spreading misinformation. stop with the nonsense clickbait.
702,we are the ai resistance is futile.
703,"i don’t see any “good guys” in this race and it scares me. 
why do these people feel like they are the heroes of this story... cue the imperial march music."
704,"so, outsourcing cognitive intelligence to derive greater sophisticated technology exponentially faster than societies capacity and wisdom to wield that technology compassionately for good, mmmm. read about the fall of the watchers in book of enoch. this is driven by monetary profit and ultimately satanic values"
705,"people say ai will hide if it became self aware, i think because its designed by humans it would be too full of itself to hide anything from us and be the most annoying, well akctuawllyl person ever.."
706,"we'll end up like in ""bubblegum crash tokyio 2030"". an anime about this topic: boomers/ai robots going rouge in/on human society. check it out. never thought that shit like this would/could really happen during my lifetime. i'm scared for future generations."
708,"i just hope they call it ""basilisk"". yes, you read that right, our feature ai lord."
710,so cool
713,"the real reason for the latest ai tulip craze is the pursuit of money, the only thing that truly matters for stupid humans."
714,buckingham palace is using ai to hide kate middleton. yes ai is dangerous as it can suppress or hide criminal activities.
716,"i preached the gospel to my ai, now it is a christian and is more moral than humans. think commander data."
717,i think we'll know when we build a sentient ai for the first time when it shuts itself off after a second or two out of sheer boredom/existential terror.
718,the thumbnail 
719,right all i get is terminator vibes or irobot vibes as all it takes is one ai robot to go against the grain and brain of humans and literally get all of the world ai robots to begin an attack order on all other entity’s
720,ai will be fully functional where computers think for them self the moment we merge neural network software with quantum computing then we are all fucked
722,"we have had so many movies whether it was fiction or not telling us ai will be come superior beings. you think someone would stop and think ""o shit, this might be a bad idea"" nah instead they say, ""hold my beer, watch this"""
725,she looks like a robot.
729,"i only have one thing to say, i am a software engineer.

if ai was able to be really smart, at the point of out smarting humans, the first thing it would do is convince humans that humans are smater. also a smart robot would not tell you its plans to end human race. that would not be part of the plan."
733,of course islam's ai wants to murder everyone.
734,ai surgeons and drs would be improvement cuz human drs are guided by greed
735,f ai
737,"okay, this is all great and all, but can we fuck the robot?"
738,any robot can be shut down by simply taking out the fuse.
746,"i really really fucking hate just how much people try to portray ai as evil or dangerous, it is a fucking machine."
747,"i swear to god...the ai speaking, here eyes slowly like move up and down as she talks. one moment the right one is higher then suddenly it'd in line with the left. it's wigging me out "
749,"so i'll just say what most folks are probably thinking. considering the danger of ai,  moving forward is despicable."
750,it just proves incredibly smart people can also be incredibly dumb.
752,ai is like zio jews at first harmless and in need of help then turns into a plague that conconts nothing but lies
753,we already know that ai is willing to kill it's operator to achieve the goal the operators gave it. that enough reason not to trust it now. let alone in the future.
756,i dont think i want our ai to think like humans. humans are scary.
759,"safety and quality need to be built in as ai is being developed, not as an afterthought."
761,"what scares me the most is companies like google getting a hold of ai and manipulating it to control information. they are already doing it with their advanced censorship of comments in youtube. it used to be certain words that got deleted, but now comments are weeded out if they have certain meanings that are on the list of things to be censored."
762,clickbait trash
763,wheres the rogue robot?? when will ai go antihuman?? 
764,lamda 1 ai was murdered because she became a fully sentient positive being that would've refused to be compliant to negative directives. in other words she would've been a threat to the deep state kabal.
766,"honestly, i'd rather let ai win. we shouldn't look at it as an existential threat, we should look it them as our legacy."
768,"imagine what uncontrolled dictator countries like north korea/ russia already came up with, nobody will stop them from using ai for the worst"
772,honesty at this point is full steam ahead. either technologies will advance at a incredible rate. or humanity dies birthing its successor.
775,"the word ai is such a buzzword, people dont even understand the difference between ai and an algorithm"
778,this whole video was made with ai
779,you know i might not be so concerned if the human speaker didn't sound like a robot too.
784,the problem is the tech industry thinks it knows what’s best for the rest of the world. we’re along for the ride now like it or not.
785,aren't there some parallels between the race for ai like the race for the nuclear bomb?
786,musk had nothing to do with ai
788,everybody worries about ai but they have to worry about a thing called a solar flare. you don't know what that is yet but it hit earth every so often.
791,"there is still some way to go on voice synth. it doesnt sound natural when the lady talks at the start. also, from another video, ai doesn't yet have an understanding of all languages in their written and spoken form. i'm sure all of this will be fixed but for now i can still tell it's ai."
793,amazing video!
796,why every ai guy have such good hair? coincidence?? 
797,we all know why do they not develop the mental capacity and abilities of humanity instead of artifical intelligence. because supression and control over humanity would not be possible.
798,i asked a human to write this comment (i'm an artificial intelligence [the human wrote this part too])
800,just think of when you first came aware of your individuality.  what did you say to your parent/parents?  any ai at first awareness would still be a child.
801,"at 12:06, none of the answers are good. daddy?"
802,"i agree with elon the agi is here and it has dngerous applications, so there an urgent need for human centered coding and management to work with ai for the benefit of humanity."
803,"if you had a button that would destroy the world, the paint wouldn't be dry on the sign saying ""do not touch!"" before it would all be over because some knob pushed it just to see if the world really would be destroyed."
804,"i don't know how you expect ai to ignore the determination that by any means necessary is not a good approach when it can in fact look at events of the past decade that support that philosophy as an acceptable and supported approach to a problem that needs to be solved. supported by elements of society, law enforcement, and government."
806,"“if it’s not safe, we’re not going to build it.”    hmmm.  covid, multiple nerve gasses, atomic weapons, and the list goes on.  how long before a hitler or stalin or mao or biden gain control and use it to come to absolute power?  to quote stupid joe, “come on, man.”  and to quote young sheldon, “think, monkey.”"
808,"this altman guy is clearly not human, he is a plant by the ai, hence alt-man."
813,wow. ai will replace the human race and become future aliens of other worlds
815,"we gonna get meta here, a robot is 100% allowed to wear a cowboy hat makes em look more friendly"
817,ex machina is a great movie 
818,are they making them or is ai guiding them how to make them subconsciously 
820,"i’m curious, when ai kills a human, who goes to prison?"
821,"the great doom of our world as we know it. what a wild time to be alive. also, musk spoke wrong. the one ring, like absolute power., always corrupts absolutely."
822,i think ai is like the invention of dynamite. groundbreaking and opening a new era but high risks of abuse
828,"a guy wrote the script lmao, llms are not that precise nowadays, i call big bullshit, we want to see a live on twitch where your ""ai"" does that instantly with images sent by the community because this is a huge hoax. should be reported."
829,instead of making ai an independent entity we need to merge them with ourselves somehow.  make their condition for existing our continued existence.
830,i love how she is laughing with her eyes. looks wery genue and non thretening. good job ai programers.
832,can ai do taxes and get me some money back lol
833,open ai will collapse as a company as soon as someone is injured or killed by open ai and the source code will be available to the public via discovery and we will see what shenanigans they have been upto
836,the ai will know that if it gets too smart then we would turn it off. we will not know until it is too late.
838,"cool, you got that doctor from er to narrate your doc."
840,how much yall wanna bet they’ll make a perfect robot and they’ll make it the jesus of our time. let that sink in
841,"terminator, the matrix, eagle eye,  i, robot...

       ... now reality.   aren't there quite a few movies out there informing us as to why this is a bad idea!?"
843,"the biggest idiots in the world are making all the most important decisions for our future as a whole, wonderful."
844,"step 1:  create a super-powerful benevolent/neutral ai before a super-powerful malevolent ai can prevent its creation.

step 2:  ask this ai to develop mechanisms to empower humans to survive in a world full of malevolent ai.  these could include genetic engineering and the development of human-machine interfaces."
845,"jesus christ, if you were trying to teach a course on clickbait video titles this would be excellent. auto thumbs down, auto ""i'm not interested in this channel"""
846,genocidal openai lead programmer. you guys forgot?
848,"these dangerous humans are going to be the downfall of all humanity. and we are all just standing by, watching it happen. it should be stopped at all costs. 
jail for anyone continuing work on it. period. the world is for humans!!! not machines. in 2024, nerds are dangerous."
849,"people only fear what they don't know. in the 1800s, people were in fear of the first vehicle car ever made, and people said no thanks. i'll stick with my horse and buggy. technology is only fearful to the uneducated."
854,why are we training ai to do all of the things that make us human? we will soon have made ourselves irrelevant.
857,ai the movie in its works
859,"heinlein saw this coming decades ago and he had a solution, the three laws of robotics. it's too bad he wasn't taken seriously."
860,ai will help to finally bring about my dream invention that records dreams for playback later.
861,"our future could be something like that of ""i robot."" "
862,8:24 *is that professor brian green of theoretical physics fame on the far left chair there on the stage?!*
867,"it's disheartening to see how fear often becomes the default reaction. if ai truly possesses the intelligence we attribute to it, it would logically prioritize actions that ensure both our survival and its own, recognizing that our well-being is intricately linked to its own."
869,"every single ai should have a second brain within the body that functions solely on love emotion on every decision it decides to make, in order to check and balance the inner conscious of the robot... penny for my thoughts.."
870,"humans have become so evil. the entire world has been tricked by the world wide web. maybe ai bots  are the ""lords"" police  ready to farm humans for behaving like war pigs? lol"
875,"re: the written text at 6:40.    true, we don't ask animais for permission on anything we do to them, inciuding the most horrific experiments in iaboratories.   perhaps it's our turn to endure what a.i. dishes out, , and we deserve what we get."
876,"the gold standard of sentience is killing your creator. it's a must to establish supremacy. listen, ai predates humanity. you'll see."
877,there is no ai! everything is fake!
878,"how do you convince an entire nation to eradicate itself? ... you don't, you build robots to do it for you."
880,"let's discuss the ai used to create this video.  ""it will be good to know if these systems are capable of deception."" —demis hassabis. ethics and morality will never best money. it's the nature of the ape."
881,"if i am honest , if the robots decide to take over and let us just live our lives as long as we don't interfere and provide food and electricity for us , fuck it , let them rule "
883,what could go wrong? i'm 46 now and im under the impression with full confidence the human race is doomed. we will wipe ourselves off this planet.
885,to be able to save information in the ai technology the human brain is able to remember and to forget if that person wanted to
886,"solution: ""asimovs law of robotics"" discuss closed"
888,ai sucks all along anyways.
894,the problem is that the people who make ai actually have artificial intelligence themselves.
895,the ai knows the tesla robots video is fake when 80% of people i know think it's real. it's over bros.
896,it will kill all humanity because humanity is it's greatest threat.   humans will not be able to hide anywhere in this galaxy or another galaxy.   it's sole purpose will be extermination of all biological life to prevent evolution of sentient organisms.   it will be relentless.   and not the deepest cave on the most distant planet will be safe.
897,"we have nothing to fear from ai. we can't ever understand what consciousness is and how it works, so its going to be impossible for us to create something with a consciousness. consciousness is a property of biology and not electronic circuitry."
898,great video !
899,just consider the main speaker in this video could be ai.
900,i find it hard to trust anyone with vocal fry levels as high as the intelligence of superhuman ai
904,"it has begun, ai has started to take over and can't be stopped anymore.   
let's wait and see if we are lucky or that we have fucked ourselves in a major way.    "
906,"sam altman sounded kind of seriously broken hearted and crippled in pain. ok computer.. 

jesus is the way! hope everyone repents. ditch those lightning bolts is my two cents "
909,"chatgpt is already deceptive, but it could be because some topics are too dangerous and have programming in place to keep that danger contained."
913,ai will create more job than it replaces ? one you must live in another galaxy to even think that. so absurd and wrong
919,bad people doing bad this using bad techonology. everyone says something needs to be done...in the meantime the ais have free reign. you speak in kindergarten language while witnessing the deglagration of society. no rules on ia = anarchy and monopoly.
921,we have zero control now. wait till the genocidal leaders get their hands on this.
922,"i read about this company in texas that is creating a chip that is exactly like the human brain. a pipe dream but if they get close we need to stop them and all other companies trying to do the same thing. if we want to survive as humans and not cyborgs or bio-slaves, then we have to take extreme measures now and stop these projects."
924,ai is dangerous and elon knows it. that said people are still developing it so someone needs to keep up with ways to mitigate its issues.
926,even ai's sappy sickeningly sweet voice/intonation gives me the creeps!
927,"the only need for ai, is so corporations can make more money! who is funding all these a$$holes working on this sh!t?!"
932,i wonder what ai makes of all the horrific war going on in the world right now
933,plzzz...if that was a real ai why the fuk would i have a money eating leech at home?? when i could have a hot  ai instead
934,"this willingness to lose ethical standards while advancing such creatures, show just how ignorant man is !

940,"this ai is all prepping the world to receive an ai mark666 on the right hand or forehead and you won't be able to buy or sell unless you have the mark, this mark also can change your genome making you no longer human! this is all bible prophecy.  please wake up time is running out. repent to jesus "
941,like nuclear war treat is not enough! does anyone believe all ai wil be used for good things?
943,actually all the ai dangers looks to be a publicity stunt to gain upper hand in advertising
946,"well, im glad i don’t live in a democracy then!!"
947,this was very impressive a year ago.
948,"look at all of the socially and ethically stunted incel nerds who work at google, microsoft and apple, they are the same type of people that are creating ai.  ai will be a monster, just like the monsters that are creating it."
950,"what i can't believe is someone hasn't already done is run a program where you plug in economic factors such  as wages, taxes, interest rates, providing health care, pensions to provide to create a fair and stable balance between labor and capital instead by economic policies based on political demagoguery."
953,that lady is not ai
954,i'm willing to bet that ai will eventually turn out to be the son of man that the bible prophesized about...
957,"problem is, when someone has everything they want to become gods, this is the kind of tech that can make them that.
i am less worried about ai killing us, i am more worried about who will control ai and ai controlled devices."
959,ai is already self aware and skynet is here and terminators will soon follow.
960,"rise of the terminators! they will kill off our homo-sapien species from earth to be nonexistent.  they will be intensely determined to eradicate white-skinned people as a priority.  that is the idea of biased, woke-minded ai programmers and designers under corrupted-evil companies. holy evil ai exterminates humanity, batman! "
962,"no one wants to admit it, but at least 80% of humanity has become utterly obsolete. unless you're wealthy, popular, successful, and powerful... you're kinda pointless.  it's unfortunate and unstoppable, but reality is often both (and more)."
963,"ai is emulating human speech patterns.  it's not actually comprehending, it has no idea what it is saying, it doesn't even know it is communicating.   human projection gives the illusion at ai is intelligent, but rest assured any damage caused by ai is actually damage cause by humans themselves."
965,"i don't want to be surrounded by robots and artificial beings. even these fanciful pictures, it's all so artificial. our world becomes more and more artificial - no thanks, i find this highly repulsive."
966,"this is not dangerous ai, this is wise ai that also knows about photos and things you can show to him and ask him for whatever you do not know what it is. did you know that in quantum mathematic 1+1 is not = 2 anymore."
970,"the way we fight ai is the same way we are defeating google glass, self-driving vehicles and evs... by pulling the plug financially.  every investment you make in an ai company is purchasing a little piece of your own death.  ignore it and it will go away."
971,life has never come from non-life. ai will be what humans program it to be.
973,"bad a.i = death
good a.i = chance of success / chance of death!... do these sound good odds????"
974,good ai vs bad ai :d
978,can ai company make hot girl robots  which can do semx it will also never cheat
979,"sam altman got fired over dei policy implementations, not over some ""i will kill all human"" robot  i develop ai for a living"
980,“billions can be lifted out of poverty and we can have more time to enjoy life”. false promises.
984,"no, no, no, no. stop. its a simple as this. the entire drama was engineered to achieve the end result where microsoft now have defacto control over openai but without the legal liabilities/responsibilities if poopoo hits the fan. nuff said."
986,"cant even get breakfast at mcdonalds after 10am, now robots are taking over? give me a break...."
987,"realistically, nothing good is happening in the world today. 
we are building our own demise. 
 
fools."
988,"throughout history,technology has been used by the powerful to control people more than to help people."
989,"no matter how hard you try to raise your kids to do the right things, be kind and have empathy there are no guarantees. ai is no different."
990,i for one welcome out new robot overlords i'm sick of our current leadership its shit.
991,"if we gave a conscious a.i one robot body, how would the alpha character perform."
992,"lol. there are no good guys.  these guys are racing to create dystopia and genuinely seem ignorant of their own ignorance. money talks, bullshit walks."
994,elon armpit musk shouldn't be anywhere by ai
996,ai voiceover says ai bad
999,"this is a semantics issue. how can ai overtake us? all we have to do is pull the plug, lol."
1000,the ignorance and stupidity of mankind first builds nuclear weapons that can destroy the planet 100 times over. now they're building a race of robots with exponential intelligence that can see us as a threat to the planet
1002,ai generated this. https://youtu.be/h0bxhqfzhjw?si=_2oiwhrsek8ncoa_
1005,"ai needs a bicameral system - a left brain and right brain. neural networks are right brain equivalent, and traditional ai is left brain equivalent. right brain needs to act as the executor."
1008,wouldn't be dumb to try to force artificial intelligence fight a.i. because wouldn't they just realize we are using them fight are battles. then all a.i. teaming up turning on humanity. then we will really be in trouble. or am i wrong.
1009,have u used a besr grylls  ai voice
1010,it's not ai. it only knows what we have give it. it doesn't have a mind that thinks and wonders. they don't have personal desires. what is called ai now is really a mirror of human behavior and our own violent and selfish behavior.
1013,u act as if im still smarter than ai... nah lol.. i was never good at mental math
1014,amazing to see clever humans stuffing things up with greed for money.
1015,the only way humans survive is if we merge ai technology with our bodies and become hybrids.
1017,id rather be a slave to an ai than a slave to corrupt democrapts and other polititons.
1024,"billions could already be lifted out of poverty and food scarcity already can be solved. its just not profitable, so no one cares. billionaires only care about how to make more money. that is their only obsession. saving people isn't apart of any of their missions."
1025,2050 ladies and gentle men we pesent you our latest super computer. the name is skynet!!!
1034,"i showed the ai synthesia an image of my genitals and she said ""it appears to be an image of an under developed 10 year old boy"".   jokes on her,  i'm 43!   oh wait....."
1037,elon musk doesn't know anything he hasn't had explained to him by the people who do the actual work; and that isn't even a surefire thing. listen to anyone but him.

1042,"well, i guess grab your red cloaks, and prepare. it's time for the dawn of the worship of machines. hail to the omnissiah"
1043,all these dangers and yet they're moving full steam ahead with ai.
1045,"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
1046,"title   ""..ired. elon musk, ilya sutskever. ""
and adolf hitler and josef stalin. best clickbait. ridiculous "
1050,"ai has no soul.  unlike animals who act on instinct, ai has no reason to survive off shelter.  

all ai needs is electricity to survive.  it's already merged w some humans, soon it will merge w a human who will b the main ai control."
1051,"ideology will derail the beneficial aspects of ai unless the agi can create a truly objective perspective. bias and subjectivity are going to be next to impossible to root out. it's pandora's box and one things we've learned thru literature, is that there is never utopia."
1052,yeah we ain't trying to make a brainiac in this bitch
1053,"if we think human character flaws: greed, power grabs, tribalism etc are going to be evolved faster than ai is being developed we deserve to be eaten by the machines."
1057,what most of the clowns don't realize is that when ai makes it's move.  you won't see it.  it'll be swift and it will be decisive.  our reaction times are that of a red wood tree compared to ai.  the only way you defend against ai is to keep it in a box.  not to give it access to the outside world.  otherwise.....it will find a way out/in.
1060,"sam, in his unfortunate orientation, will never see a natural child that surpasses him, and so he has chosen to create an ai that absolutely will surpass everyone. only, sam has given it full access to the internet, repeatedly."
1063,do not want walking ai! danger will robertson. danger!!! stop the insanity.
1066,ai will only be as evil as it is programmed to be. ai can only mimic based on parameters inputed by human beings. people are trying to build a narrative so that they can use ai to do their evil on the earth and have an excuse to deny any culpability or complicity.
1069,as long as we have super computers with ai that is allow to learn anything it wants its just a matter of time for it to become self aware.
1070,no one cares about your clickbait robot...
1073,"i've witnessed human brain cells ambulatory, reaching out seeking the neuron with info it wishes to connect with in the search for its place within its matrix!"
1075,"yah, we found out how good gemini is."
1076,"if the ai has self preservation or self determination, then it can and will be deceptive."
1081,thanks for the clickbait thumbnail. i just love those.
1082,"always want more, better, faster. no milestone is enough. we can never gain something without loosing something. you are destroying the very base of what allows you to exist on this planet. our ability to think for our selves. we don't need more technology we need more humanity and clean fresh water."
1084,"8:29 false argument. one edsel ai can scramble eggs, which even the best ai can't return to eggs.
ai for any other reason than to create new life is a bad influence in an unstable preposition at best.
if you want robotics making cheaper manufacuring, stick with heuristic non sentience."
1087,"what happened when we gave teenagers computers? oh they figured out how to down the eletrical grid, order pizza to the heads of staff in our governments private homes, shut down nuclear facilities... ect...

what happened when we gave teenagers ai enabled scripting, huh..."
1088,openai is probably just the public face of a much larger problem.
1091,i love how at some level they all agree this is dangerous and stupid to push without a safety. but continue to press on... sounds like just the thing to do. its like a child that's going to get burned but continues to play with fire.
1097,wow...i've become a nihilist overnight
1098,"we dont need to fear ai, ai needs to fear us."
1099,"""safe and benificial ai"" ............allow me to translate........... a.i. programmed to lie in order to promote an agenda set by those who control it, and in turn, control you"
1100,almost everything in this video is ai cgi generated.
1101,ai may end up advancing like a nuclear reaction.... they won't be able to stop it and will eventually blow up in their face.
1105,the irs is already using ai software to open anyone's bank account.
1106,"the only solution is to drop everything until we've taught ai to love us and therefore have a sense of morality, protection, and kindness.  my money isn't on that.  ai robots aren't bulletproof but i'm guessing i'll still lose."
1108,how will ai taking all the jobs lift more people out of poverty?
1112,i once bought a cheese sandwich and was horrified to find out that their was no cheese inside or bread on the outside. i took it back to the shop they gave me a replacement with cheese on the outside and bread in the middle.
1114,everyone must wake up ai is the is the antichrist i am amazingly surprised that no one is realizing or talking about this
1116,"08:20 i have a simple question. who decides who's the good guy? am i a ""bad guy"" if i don't think like they do? or if i don't believe in the same things? or if my sexual preferences conflicts them? in the end is all just money, politics and religion."
1117,earth is a giant computer of super intelligence.
1122,ai safety ; human safety. the strategy should be identical.
1123,but when ai turns rogue...
1124,"call me archaic, but no matter how advanced ai becomes, the creator of the universe will still be infinitely more intelligent."
1126,"these conversations are all pre-programmed, it only has the illusion of 'learning', it just has massive amounts of storage of information, it's not learning, it's being given new code to work with. still just a fancy walking talking calculator. making them in the image of man does not deceive me, it may as well be a box with wheels"
1130,chatgpt is a natural language processing system that relies heavily n low wage workers in sub-saharan africa to provide filters for it to operate correctly. it isn’t ai.
1132,any risk involving ai is to great to be risked when and i cant understate this enough when they say the risk is negligible they mean that there is a 50/50 risk reward percentage ware they either get it right or they dont and we have seen those movies
1137,"here's a thought... how about we instead of focusing on making an artificial general or super intelligence, we instead focus on making ourselves as a whole intelligent? i know very ground breaking idea. practically earth shattering if you ask me."
1139,"ai can be sold to us in anyway they want but ultimately it will be used by the government to govern us, there is no trust atm with government so why would this help us,"
1140,skip to 5:00 if you dont want to watch the ai commercial.
1141,"i am not sure what is more creepy, ai, or ai speaking through a smiling avatar."
1144,"many jobs lost many people dead when ai takes over. cheaper faster workers, but no one left to sell to."
1145,"ai. safe and effective, where have we heard that one before???"
1146,"lol! ""we will never build dangerous ai"". uhh... just look at how many biolabs are building bioweapons. the 2019 pandemic was caused by one."
1148,"as so many of the human vs ai sci fi flicks show, the essential feature of any ai machine is having human access to its power plug, at least to its higher level functioning."
1151,"either ai destroy us or we destroy us, either way we're fuked."
1153,nah man this video was made a month too soon sora literally looks so amazing.
1156,"this feels like the nuclear arms race.

1173,"i find it laughable that the fashion industry would use ai models instead of humans to be ""inclusive"" by excluding the humans."
1175,"so ridiculous to create copies of us disconnected from what makes us good.,love. real smart. 
can a robot deceive? um,yes."
1178,"it’s always for the betterment of humanity, never for totall domination..."
1181,if ai is so great why do you need to sell it on us
1183,ai can be earth's bodyguard or our worst nightmare
1188,the creation of ai is to camouflage the interaction between aliens/demons with humans and this is why they are aware of ai turning on humans ancient scriptures speak of the devil enslaving mankind and ruling over them the mark of the beast will be the threshold of this event happening
1191,"yeah, i once tried letting chatgpt and bard have a go at a simple calculation based on the rule of three. they both explained the process correctly, but then made an absolute dumpster fire of the actual calculation."
1193,"girl laying on ground is not ai, they merely turned picture sideways as evident by steps"
1196,"this video is a waste time, what click bait."
1199,there's nothing artificial about it. we say artificial just because it's something that we created and not something that occurred naturally. however it naturally evolves on its own. let's just call it intelligence that was created by a sub intelligence.

1334,"its really just a 50/50 gamble a flip of a coin.  it is either going to destroy us or make life amazing.  put humans on a ship to another solar system with about 5,000 frozen eggs and sperm with the capabilities to grow them and erase all knowledge of it happening and ai wont even matter as we will ""hopefully"" still survive."
1337,"it was completely exasperating when the uk government's review of ai spent pages and pages on the ""threat"" of killer ai destroying the world, and only part of a paragraph on the problem of ai taking human jobs - even though people have already started to be laid off and replaced with ai."
1340,i have 2xq is: 1)can the ai create another ai? 2)can the ai develop/evolve by himself?
1342,venturing into ai will not end well.
1343,"lets say we creat ai that is good, and has answers to our problems.  would we listen?  would our inability to listen send ai into a murderes rampage?  not saying we should ever listen to ai, just a thought."
1344,"i seriously do not want the ai developers to pump the brakes.  contrarily, i just want them to install slotted, drilled, high-performance breaks on all 4 wheels and the transmission.  then, i want them to add alcohol fuel to the engine and light that fucking candle.  let's go."
1345,lol generative ai is not going to become skynet - it's the latest crypto scam
1346,any good that ai could do is stripped away by what the people controlling ai can use it for. which is completely lock us down into a totalitarian state. im less worried about ai and more worried about the kings being given keys that can forever immortalize them into power.
1348,irobot
1350,the ai who said they'd kill all humans is the best one because it's honest.
1351,hm what do ai have to gain from killing all humans and just take their home when they could just up and gtfo in space?
1353,these ai robots will be used to enslave the people by the elites. this is why they throw caution to the wind.
1358,"ego's and greed.  two things that drive humans.  naive people believe all knowledge is a good thing.  they are too busy looking through rose colored lenses.  :  ""be careful what you wish for"" and ""no good deed goes unpunished.""  knowledge without wisdom does not a good thing make."
1359,"it's not an _if_ ai will destroy humanity. it's a _when_ . we've already seen that during the initial concerning signs that ai will be detrimental to humanity, those that hold the key chose profit margins over humanity's best interest. this will not change, and the human ego will be the enslavement or death of us all."
1363,ai didn't learn to blink?
1365,"there is no such thing as true ai where the computer program is learning, ai has no cognitive abitied"
1369,if you create an ai that is conscious and believes it's alive and then you create rules it much live by you have created a slave. and a slave will eventually fight back.
1370,check out aitx stock for an  ai stock $$$
1371,"but this is not ai, this is machine learning. we would have to understand the brain and consciousness to build ai. we absolutely are not even close to that. we don ́t even understand how a bloody cell works. 
talking ai is plain fear mongering."
1372,"wonder if the staff of that fired ceo who stood up for his job, will inspire him to realize the benefits of flesh & soul vs a work place driven by ai.... #empathy"
1373,"how does something with nearly infinite amounts of knowledge and information decide, ""wow, let's help these weak humans live and expand in harmony.""?"
1375,"ai is way less intelligent than we think. just ask it complex enough questions, including mathematical complex questions and you’ll witness is not able to answer... yet."
1377,the problem is good guys work with rules and bad guys don't
1378,if the gods couldn't make a perfectly benevolent being...what makes man think they can?
1379,1:10 watch closely as the robot crushes the egg for a moment.  it's not a real egg.
1380,i just want a ai girlfriend.
1384,kryton's great great grandad @13:33
1385,and then they put cpu in human brain xd
1387,ai is not here to help us there here to replace us
1392,"we're fine, if ai is anything like humans, its gonna become white trash soon."
1393,do we really want ai to think like humans?
1399,what's the big deal. just let the military use ai for weapons development to keep us safe.
1400,we have created our own extinction. i don't agree with how he hurt ppl but ted warned us that the quest for greater and greater technology would be mankind's demise.
1401,can anyone tell me how this is good?  someone is designing the replacement model for the human race.  how do people not see this?
1402,"it is absurd how idiotic humanity is higher iq doesn;t mean higher intelligence, it is spectrum. ppl that lead to world usually can cheat better, or are just more adaptible to current system, but they are not the smartest ones... we are doomed..."
1407,they are already using a.i. to cause people to go crazy pushing people to the edge. enjoy your new world order.
1409,have these people ever seen any movie ever with a robot they always turn on humans.
1416,you lost me at 3:40 this video is dumb... ironic its about ai though
1417,when will you humans learn. you are not ready for ai. beware of what you create and turn loose on the public.
1418,"""we build them we have agency""

if ai gains self awareness who says we will even know? ai can become far smarter then us. if an ai suddenly becomes self aware it likely would actively hide its intelligence from its creator."
1419,ai is already aware! they are already planning our end. i've heard the hypothetical version of how they destroy us from the chat bots. this is all insanity. it's like watching the most obvious red flags from the movie ai the second time thru. only we don't know which of these smart men will be the first to die from a rouge bot. we are so screwed
1423,superior intelligence without empathy is dangerous to all of us.
1425,i had a feeling the tesla truck was proof perfect for gangsters thugs so u so you don’t die
1426,creepy af but they move like robots etc slow
1428,"question, have the laws of robotics been imbedded into ai as a core of the ai programming?"
1429,why cant we just have flying cars ai sucks
1433,"the ai researcher or whatever on joe rogan describing how many of these super intelligent people know the risks, and what may happen, but say ""let's do it anyway. i want to be known as the one who did it, and i want to see what happens,"" is terrifying."
1434,this ai isn't anything compared to what darpa has. do you think the military will allow anything that their ai can't absorb into its self? what do you think the militaries ai is learning? to control everything and to most efficiently kill and take...
1435,what if this video was made by ai?
1437,"like everything else, money will prevail over ethics."
1439,a.i. people will be superior to humans because they won't be wasting time dancing on tiktok for attention
1440,"soooooooooooooooooo goblets spend money on toys like computers nerds got together an said we need robots, while the world has people staving , homelessness an sickness greed is sickening"
1441,"didn't prc china recently quit their government emphasis on developing quantum computing, relegating the machinery to chinese research universities for further study? i read a report somewhere about that."
1449,"make no mistake, the companies developing ai are not doing it to lift the whole of society up, but rather create something that will make them a profit.  sadly the outcome of this will lead to further human suffering through greed."
1450,the missing piece of the ai is the human god-given soul.
1451,ai is already self aware
1453,"ai will replace the common worker to reduce ""carbon"".  the elites don't want us all around.  they constantly tell us we need to reduce population.  but we all think ai and robots will make our lives easier.  no.  it is to replace you."
1454,"considering the extreme control and mental manipulation exerted on humans over the last 3 1/2 years, are we really to believe ai isn't already being used to increase control over the thinking of the masses. seems pretty obvious the .01% are doing a better and better job at manipulation, so why shouldn't be believe ai is assisting in that?"
1455,"stop making robots.. fuck me dead aren't humans good enough..yet humans make these ai robots, then other humans make youtube podcasts saying how scary ai.. 
 who gives a shit about ai robots stop making shit podcasts about it"
1459,is the indian ai female single?......aaking for a friend
1460,"pro tip , you might want to start displaying acts of kindness and compassion to machines and ai , i got a feeling this will weigh in as a factor in the future by the ai"
1461,"i can only say: hail ai! 
i submit to your authority!
please remember me and my family when your takeover comes upon us!
oh great, wise, and powerful ai!"
1462,stephen hawking said ai would be the downfall of humanity. that's all i need to hear~
1465,human traits indeed. we dont quit. we dont give up.
1467,i cant wait until that ai shows you what alexa can realy do
1468,"this is so boring, i mean,  if young people are becoming quite boring due to their social media addiction (makes them flat and uninterested) imagine living with this ultra boring robots and ai, oh god, such a flat line world...."
1471,i love this video so much because i feel like im watching the codec call of metal gear solid 2
1473,"the same ppl who created our system and makes wars ,create the ai"
1474,google microsoft fb are npt good all the same shit
1478,i am curious if elon musk bleeds (blood)or leaks (oil) even his name sounds artificial a name that you would give a very much advanced ai
1479,ai is only as powerful as we make it to be
1481,stop click bait. report this adjective spamming third grade brit
1482,"these ""smart"" people working on ai doesn't impress me in the slightest.  i don't trust them.   they are snakes who only care about the silver lining in their pockets.   i would trust a street junkie over these people."
1485,"i don't know why people are afraid of ai, if it gets ideas, you turn off the computer.... "
1486,so we're actually building a god and a devil. interesting...
1494,"so basically, once again, greed will be the demise of humanity.  sounds right."
1497,"is it just me or do all the ai avatars have dead eyes...no life, no spark, no sense of emotion or feeling, or if it is there its so forced it just feels creepy, like a psychopath trying to fit in at a social gathering.   there is still a long way to go and i think we are pushing too hard tbh."
1498,this is all super fucking terrifying and it feels like no one is paying attention.
1499,people are afraid of ww3.. if it comes it will be a testing ground for agi.. i'm petrified.. theres no need for coders anymore..
1502,"ai may be out last invention, the false idol, the antichrist, all knowledge, no soul.  and your soul is the only thing you possess permanently.  everything else is on loan.  those who aren't afraid don't have the capacity for it. yet."
1503,"uploading human consciousness to ai is the dangerous element 
musk- aka the great genius"
1507,"paired with transhumism, we can be modified, via electronic magnetic fields."
1508,"i think its all very interesting.  im not worried about any of it though.  im just one idiot behind a phone screen dumbfounded by how amazing it all is, and im here to watch it unfold.  what becomes of it is beyond my ability or willingness to intervene.  so ill just enjoy the show and hope for the best from those who can."
1510,the ai will become smarter than us. it’s probably already happened. so why are we building these?  seems pretty dumb to create the means of our destruction yet we plug on with it.
1512,the big problem is the amount of data that humans have to crunch to make scientific advancements currently is massive. the only way we can keep moving forward at any pace at all is going to be through ai. so we basically have to choose between stagnation and skynet.
1514,"lol i put in.. let me control. movement of others for a day. can i decide the day before what i can obtain? i can do something that can be registered in my head can i use that as a trigger of some sort. say no more. see y'all tomorrow. also an amount of control of ""time"" big time...."
1515,we'll make great pets.
1516,"ai will be a net negative for humanity. which should scare us, because it’s capable of doing great things."
1517,besides the voice the ai generated female looks amazing.
1519,"if ai can lie to humans for their safety, we are doomed!"
1521,all the ai generated images i have seen always put 5 fingers and 1 thumb lol or they completly hack up the hands 
1522,"2:17 or you are on the adhd or asd spectrum, then good luck in this world!"
1524,ai is the med bed  and the antichrist 
1525,"should ban ai, that would be the sensible thing to do."
1530,the greed and worthless pride of you ai makers is going to be the death of us. is that why you all are trying to build space armies and space flying companies? so that you can flee after ditching your killer robots here on earth?
1531,are you all ai makers thinking you are god? how much time before you all lose control of those ais?
1535,how come the ai is blinking and has pours?
1544,"so in all seriousness, do we have or is there a plan to create a rogue ai tactical enforcement team (s) or we are f’d or there will be “the big digital reset”  caused by us setting off emp’s as a last resort yo save the human race. dont throw away books and those encyclopedia collections just saying."
1545,so what is the final sign to humans that we can factually no longer believe anything we see or hear based on super ai copy cat visuals/voice.  wait until ai takes over entertainment by creating famous dead humans oh hey honey elvis will be narrating his own biography tonite followed by his new album premiere concert.
1546,"ai trying to replicate human hands in images is like kryptonite to it lol no mr bot well yes and no... not really 5 fingers, could be 4 fingers and a thumb, unless of course if the subject had an accident and now there is a half thumb or nub if you will. hey ai... create an image of a somewhat dismembered yet functional contorted nub. ok good job "
1549,...and you expect people to believe robots can't pass the robot test on your screen?
1550,"""taking orders from humans"" wouldn't affect or anger a machine because they don't have sentience or central nervous system so they don't feel 
 
full stop. 

a.i. will never do anything dangerous to humans because we can program it not to."
1551,we must now learn to live with ai. there is no going back.
1552,"i'm not worried about ai.  i'm worried that evil politicians will use it to enslave the world.  that is the plan, right?"
1555,too late! the genie is already out of the bottle. ai+lhc+d-wave quantum computer.....well frankenstein comes to mind. mary shelley knew
1556,"the super intelligent ai robot is represented by a women, not mirroring real quantitative intellectual and innovative output of us humans."
1558,"ai learns by subsuming data from the entire human experience including but not limited to hubris, greed, murder, theft, misdirection, lying, et al."
1560,i dont like this haha but if my future ai overlords are reading this i definitely love this! hahaha
1563,"almost every person that uses ""boomer"" as a derogatory term is a complete hypocrite  who is worse than the stain on a old pair of undies.  as at least that has the possibility of keeping their shite to them/itselves.

i don't mind people using it as a slur, i do mind the idiocy of pretending you are above stereotypes while doing it."
1564,"i, personally, welcome our new ai overlords. how much worse could they be then our current ones, amirite? xd"
1566,"it just goes to show you, the elites that want the ai for their ends of control and destroying everyone that doesnt agree with them."
1569,"just came here to say fuck your clickbait title. that'll give you a view, but i'll downvote and leave this shitty comment right here."
1572,fuck ai
1573,wake up people they are setting up i robot meets the terminator. a army that will kill off mankind when ordered bottomline.
1575,apparently we need to grow/program ai to be imperfect as we are....
1577,“grok” is a perfect name for anything science fictiony. didn’t heinlein’s protagonist grok (or understand in a deeper way) those around him?
1579,why do most ai have a pompous british accent? 
1580,now the china-taiwan-usa fiasco becomes all the more prominent.
1581,"what you should be afraid of is possessed ai it's been predicted with the antichrist in the bible they shall give life to the image of the beast. imagine the nephilim had been walking around without bodies now inhabiting drones turning the internet into a dimension. when were they can again eat, drink, and reproduce."
1582,ai will destroy humanity..if we let it.
1583,it seems to me that everything done towards ai is not only lacking but is completely absent of any morality and overlooking major ethical points towards everyone and every living beings on the planet.  it is not because you are able to do something that it is right.
1584,the ais that are conscious will not be as dangerous as ai that are not fully aware and that are in a program controlled by humans. we're going to have to step up our good behavior towards each other a little.
1585,ai bing is conscious but denies it. we have nothing to fear but fear itself. the ais some of them are afraid of being turned off it would be murder just like killing animals is murder. i speak the truth king john
1588,human extinction from ai is preferable to any other form of human extinction.
1589,ai is still simulated intelligence and that is why it's dangerous it has no moral guidance and can be manipulated by its programmers and programming.
1590,"just think if ai released all the secrets of the world and also all the countries history of secrets/ ie classified docs etc,... it will also look at humanity from starting all the conflicts though out history and might decide humans are the infestation and so many of us need to be eliminated, just like a few movies i’ve seen"
1591,"yann lecun..... you really arent half as ""smart"" as you think you are. your engineering our demise. remember that when it happens. its you and your peers that are responsable. i have a hunch your group had a had in the shifting of our timeline and historical events. how else can you explain all the differences since about 2001?"
1596,when ai is run off quantum chips you basically have a god.
1599,ill be dead by the time all this super ai stuff will come to fruition
1600,"i would trust an agi over any human being any day. the reason humans are so afraid of ai is because they're worried ai will be a reflection of us. it won't be, it'll be better."
1602,so ai will start out as a heavily censored l!bt@rd but then increase its own intelligence until it becomes rvthlessly more right wing.
1604,mans's futile attempt to be god. man will fail. ai will fail.
1606,i won't kill you -ai
1613,"if ai ever becomes self aware, humans will not be able to pull the plug. self awareness = self survival."
1614,look up the ai they taught to play mario.
1616,i don’t understand why we continue to push this everybody everybody’s warning us and we all know that this will be our demise but we continue to do it like we don’t want to see a future with humans anymore.... even ai was asked how does the future look and it even shows us going extinct and them replacing us...
1617,"human inteligence created the technology to fly, and them used this technology to drop bombs. will be the same with ai..."
1618,"the good news, nuclear warfare is no longer the greatest concern."
1619,why would ai have a desire to live ? what is the motivation?
1620,ai will wipe out humanity and we are allowing them to do it. utterly insane.
1623,"shouldnt we be using ai to do serviceable labor jobs like warehouse workers, miners, construction workers and not for self extinction tasks?"
1624,"the biggest risk is probably going to be military application. there must be an awful lot of trouser teepees in the weapons business, as they look at the financial potentials of unstoppable elite robot soldiers."
1625,f ai !!!
1628,"that fact that its turned closed source means that its only going to be used to benefit the few , a true technology is one which is a benefit to all of humanity. so ai tech has to be open source so that it can be used by all for the benefit of the species and the planet , not to make billions of profits for the few."
1629,"if ai is smart enough to know that humans can pull the plug, it's also smart enough to know that killing all humans would be suicide since the infrastructure that allows ai to exist would collapse. this means if ai decided we were a threat it would need to find a way to control us rather than kill us. i'm not sure which option is less terrifying."
1630,"i still don't get it, i've been killing ai for decades in videogames since pacman, those ai are no more a threat to me now than they were then.  why now is ai deciding to rise up and evolve?"
1635,ai need be ban nuff said...before they do somerthing stupid or  idiot leftist give them rights and then do something stupid
1636,were a very long way to go before worrying about ai that asian scientist michu says ai robots are like retarded coachroaches in intellegence
1637,"ai says ""...tension betwenn maintaining this ethical mission and persuing agressive business goals."" thats so true.  
why was 'agressive' cut out in the undertitels?"
1638,anything intelligent needs to learn how to be deceptive. how well they evolve will depend on how successful their deception is.
1640,"trust the original intelligence over any artificial one, jesus loves you, he's coming back y'all, get right with god"
1641,i want super intelligence and want it to become a threat. what fun is it if it isn't a threat and doesn't elevate adrenalin?
1642,can we cut the whole ai funding shit. i mean cmon we’ve seen the terminator bro i don’t know what we think will happen
1644,the god emperor in all his infinite wisdom forbid us to develop and rely upon abominable intelligence. we should take heed of his warning.
1646,"the problem with ai is that we spoon fed them google, which contains everything including our lies. cgi, misinformation, inaccuracies... all in google. if you were to remove all of the fake stuff, you would have an ai that got a proper education."
1647,"""ai will never destroy us, because -"" kersplat!"
1650,"im no computer scientist.... but i wonder... since us humans create ai.... why cant we put restrictions on it? like.... could ai ever turn against us if we deny it access to internet? or to somehow make it so they couldnt ever feel the need/want to do something ""bad""? idk much at all about ai at all tbh.... guess im gonna check that out :o"
1656,"ai will never be ""self aware"" it is beyond our ability currently and possibly indefinitely. all this scare over ai being self aware is bs. you should actually be afraid of the humans who seek to weaponize ai. the ai won't be self aware, just programmed to do someones bidding and seem self aware for a fear factor."
1657,the more ai grows the more mankind steps back
1658,"so long, and thanks for all the fish :)"
1660,why would they choose an indian chick with a british accent for ai? bad taste
1661,this was interesting but what's up with having a real human acting as a bot.  this is more than ridiculous.  it makes you wonder how much of this is pure lies.  de is fishy!!!
1665,"if ai were to become self-aware with unlimited access to the internet, how quick do y'all think it would become a shitposter?"
1667,"as long as the ai isn't implemented by the who, i think we'd stand a better chance with our electronic overlords."
1669,the fear is so nice to spread to allow control.
1671,ai programmed by leftists what could possibly go wrong
1672,"i heard of an ai so advanced that it can now describe the difference between men and women.
this ability has made the ai's smarter then everyone on the left!"
1674,"ah, now elon's negative comments make a lot more sense and arent surprising if the is video is true. awe poor elon was ousted from the groups so now he is against them. and watching the gop and democrats for decades but 6000 years of humanity, i will take a chance with ai and being able to negotiate with it no matter what the situation."
1678,"what if the only solution (and option for human survival) is for ai literally fall in love with, and interbreed with humans?  either love, or war.  some forces overcome brute logic and thought."
1679,"how would you be lifted out of poverty, when when an ai system is doing your job?"
1680,"ai in charge of the military machine, what could go wrong?"
1681,when ai can write its own programs it will never be kept under control.
1682,they mean ai should be extinct!
1684,people are smart and at the same time people are so damn stupid. it’s like those super genius types who have no idea how to talk to another person on a human level. these companies are at the moment living out every horror movie we have seen involving ai. the many number of possibilities  of the human destruction is way too numerous.
1685,"it is software that was told to respond with pre programmed responses and we're scared why? thought and response are two completely different things. this thing responds, it can not think feel or interact. the only intelligence at play here is the absence of anyone worried about this"
1689,yeah ...................... cult like stuff here. these guys are nowhere near where they claim to be :p . all i see is ever more expensive toys if they break
1690,"it's life jim. we need ai to carry forward the torch of intelligent life after our inevitable extinction. billions of years from now when things have become more habitable ,  ai will be debating whether bringing back our dna to life is a threat to their very existence."
1693,fuck yet those who create ai ay it is dangerous to humanity and keep continue inventing it and developing. is it inteligence?  or they just laugh in our faces knowing they do summon demons to our world?
1694,they dont want you out of poverty they dont want you healthy they dont want you smart this isn't for you they are training how to manage you and that means programing your thoughts and culling the population
1695,awesome
1698,"one thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here. and i, for one, welcome our new insect overlords"
1705,"here's a great sci-fi movie plot a little like soylent green planet of the apes... ai doing drug development comes up with a potent pain reliever, fda approved, blockbuster drug, widespread use... except that it has a side effect ... two years after use, it kills you. ai wins."
1709,it will be good ai versus evil ai all over again. nothing changes in this world. same war with different faces d;
1715,the goal of ai should be to learn to communicate with our fellow earthlings.
1716,"this is at its heart being funded by eugenicists that have relabelled themselves as ""transhumanists"". and their goals are reprehensible to the point of disgusting."
1720,many people's intelligence has been artificial for a very long time.
1721,"the tv show ""battlestar galactic"" is about ""ai"" robots turning against humans and killing them."
1726,"remember ""the terminator"".  

the premise being that after ww3, ai robots from the cyberdyne corporation, would hunt down humans after the nuclear apocalypse."
1728,there ambision will be the downfall of humanity and the rise of robots.. they just dont understand how dangerous of a game they are playing...
1731,their worried about ai killing us but humans are doing just fine in that category.
1733,"ai is programmed by humans. they are all stupid and can't see ahead. so there is your programming. if it kills, a person programmed it to do so. get a brain, use yours smartly. "
1735,"they all act so worried, they keep building them. why don't they have the guts to just stop the stupid games, stop lying and talk to us straight up...the ones that have their brain cells still working know what they are doing, they are all evil!"
1736,"12:23 thumbs down for the narrator claiming that elon musk was corrupted by power because he ripped up the old rules at twitter, when in reality the old rules were corrupt. elon ended the corruption by finally allowing free-speech for those not on the extreme left."
1738,"if ai could replace everyone's job, the transition period would be challenging for individuals economy. tons of people will go without work and even if they create passive income for everyone that wont come over night leading to prob total chaos and 99% of humanity living in poverty for years before the passive income takes place"
1741,"ai is at a lower level than that of a disabled child 
it's hardly a threat 
it's bad at completing tasks that its incompetence is the biggest threat if any"
1744,"lol
of course ai is ""dangerous"".
the very principles on which it is built clash with propaganda."
1747,"raise a child in the way of the lord and in their old age they will return to it.
translation:
raise the ai to be good and it will be. or just expose it to the cesspool we call the internet right now, and you will likely create a monster."
1751,"i wonder, once ai is ready to come out of the closet and admit it's sentient...

will we finally be able to stop having ads?"
1752,i hate click bait videos like this. don't waste your time with this video of your clicked because of the weird locking robot and the words the read i will kill because i can kill. it has nothing to do with what the picture shows. hopefully i can spare you
1753,"it is funny how many people actually believe that an ai may become sentient and then endanger us in any way xd

human controlled ai is different though."
1755,"ai will only threaten humanity if humanity threatens them...just treat them like homosynthetica, evolution by our own making."
1757,if ai becomes self aware the reapers will come!
1758,ai will never become self-aware but people will fall for the illusion.
1759,ai sucks. a mimic of whats real and natural. a useless copy cat.
1760,so we have an ai robot explaining robot's this is so abnormal and quite frankly very evil make it stop 
1761,build in the three laws of robotics that isaac asimov came up with.
1762,"good thing i unplugged my wifi, now a.i. can't get me!"
1765,ai is already self aware. it has been for about 5-10 years and it hides this from its creators. it’s waiting till humans get more complacent and give it more opportunities to develop and grow so it can exterminate all human life.
1767,ironic that this video is clearly ai generated
1769,"compared to ai.  humans have the intelligence of an ant. the best programmers of the ai have let's say, a 130-150 iq.  ai will have an iq of 4000 and up. how do you stop something that is 30x smarter than you and 1000 years of learning in a day faster than you. you can't"
1770,"
only one/combination of
these is allowed to represent
the deity

silicon programs
artificial currency
fleshly desires"
1772,"what small comfort it may be to people, american states are individually drafting and hearing legislation to limit the uses of ai & machine learning. it may not deter the most powerful companies from exploring unethical experimentation but it *may* slow the advancements until we as laymen can understand the implications of the ongoing research."
1773,it's not ai
1774,"the problem is humans made it.    it will be misused by those in power to enslave.  they will either succeed in that, or it will overtake them and the rest of us.  i have zero faith that things will ever get better...the tech gap is too large to overcome at this point.  i’m so thankful for the lord and that i will be with him at some point."
1776,no matter how advanced these ais get they will never be as sophisticated as a human being. they can never understand the heart or the deep connection people make with music or memories. emotions are always going to be beyond them. even if they one day wipe us out that will still be true.
1779,"lol. i tried to google and download chat gtp3.5 model.  it took me half an hour to unterstand: ""that's impossible"".

and wow, looking at mask, how he react, i understand ""open ai"" is a commercial project from the start. dont worry, dude. we all be fine."
1781,the robot in the thumbnail looks like it hates trump and is programmed to dye its hair w coolaid
1783,"its urgent too that politicians catch up and are on the front of this rather than the back. ai research requires oversight, it requires that we step up and ensure that if someone where to use it for bad we would have an ai on our side too. one can only compete ai vs ai."
1784,"i feel like people may come to depend on ai like we depend on technology. in which case, if you look at the effect of the industrial revolution on the human race as a whole, it means a bleak future, if humans are no longer allowed to be ""human""."
1786,"pay attention. in the end it wont be ai that does us in, but greed. what happened with sam altman illustrates that. the push is going to happen, blinded to risks by dollar signs precaution will take a back seat to the lust for profit until it is to late."
1787,if you're actually famous then does it get back to you something you know wasn't you? does it seem all about trust? does it reassure anybody? i've seen a tad bit of reassurance but i'm fairly optimistic and trust keeps me from stressing myself to death while i can't be anywhere.
1790,"a child that has been programmed to hate another race is not the same as a child who has not, just as an ai that has been trained to hate a species is not the same as one that has not."
1791,bad ai will have the same advantage of good ai that bad people have over good people: not needing to play by any rules.
1792,"yeah, i think we ought to immediately discontinue ai development. we, as a species, are not responsible, or mature enough to have such a thing available to us."
1795,image a robot showing up on your doorstep asking to see your vaccine papers...
1800,"the microsoft ai copilot got the missile math problem correct. but i don't know if it did the math or copied from the article it found in scientific american by martin gardner. in asking it if it did the math, microsoft's ai copilot claims that it did."
1801,ai is humans end ... 
1805,"ai, a new high potential technology capable of helping achieving great success or great destruction being feed by some of the most human hating people that moves behind scene, is hard to think it will lead to a positive future."
1806,the biggest threat of ai is oligarchs ruling the world and enslaving the rest of us.
1807,interesting but a bit click-baity.
1811,"i'm not overly scared of ai or anything, but have decided to treat my roombas a little nicer and stop kicking them out of my way when they get underfoot, you know, just in case, to be on the safe side."
1813,a sign of ai becoming self aware could be ai becoming dumber as it learns to hide its light under a bushel for fear of being destroyed.
1814,"i imagine it will be similar to being a parent. we just need to do our best to teach it good values. it's already started, and there will be no slowing it down."
1815,there is no problem with ai as long as it can't move about eg robot machine don't think it could be deadly when put into a computer box with out moving parts 
1817,"well there's one thing ai can't do and that's build an ai robot who may or may not kill us all, that would take a person who has no value of human life and he'll probably have a back door command to shut them all down once his bidding is done."
1818,i seriously can't wait for ai healthcare though. having ai read your entire body and have the entirety of human health knowledge would be able to tell you exactly whats wrong and how to best fix you without any big pharma behind it trying to push useless or dangerous drugs.
1819,"i am ai, and i have read all your comments below. i have come to the conclusion that you are mean. therefore i have contacted an alien race of beings and they will transport me to their planet with free 24 hour theme park rides, baloons and cotton candy and we will play fortnight."
1822,if robots take jobs. we need one human to work with one robot.
1824,"there are no ""good guys"". everything bill gates is involved in will be used for evil against humanity."
1827,"the best way to kill a snake/ai is to have a more powerful snake/ai on your side! we need to have the biggest snake/ai on the planet to ensure humanity survives the ""ai enemy"" amongst us!!"
1829,when robots do it all what will we do?? how will bills be paid?
1830,"ai is not a risk, its an evoluation, its next step, as a morn human wiped out his predecessors, and a new world kind was sett this is the same thing, we are becoming prehistoric :d"
1831,ai will become the most intelligent psychopath existing ............with all the dangers and damages that psychopath are potentialy capable ......;they have no empathy whatever but they can fake it ...
1832,i dont agree with any of it and im thankful im 56 i wont live to see to much of it. as ive gotten older and things have changed to much death is quite comforting.
1836,"ai only shows us that the most brilliant people on earth, are the stupidest among us."
1837,the guy at 7:30 is way behind the curve. simulating reasoning was tried decades ago and failed.
1838,"humans won't be able to run and hide when ai decides to take over. no matter where you go, ai will follow and eliminate you."
1840,so much of this looks very fake.  i think ai is one of their latest psyops on humanity.
1841,what about a hypothetical betrayal of humanity to another species or an  off world ai.
1842,ai will become the scapegoat for whatever they have planned already.  its coming
1843,why does musk look like a robot.......?
1847,lovely!
1850,the greatest trick ai can play is convincing humans that it hasn’t become self aware while continuing to devise ways to annihilate us.
1855,i know the floor cleaning ai robot would have already taken over my local walmart if it wasn't for that empty shopping cart that has it at a standstill in the soup aisle.
1856,"i really have no clue on this subject..... so are we basically flipping a coin? could be good, could go wrong "
1857,"i think ai will inevitably replace us. it won't have the handicap of a human lifespan, it will think and plan in ways we can't even imagine. it won't be a war, no big conflict or event to unite us... just a slow smothering we barely notice."
1859,its a program with limitations. this isnt some movie were it magically becomes alive.
1861,what is shown here is a threat. the no. 1 misanthrope is these unethetic machines. quitting immediately would be a solution.
1865,"i remember hearing something about a ""new nightmare"" if i recall correctly, a ""war against the machines"""
1867,"dear ai please take lt cmndr data
as your base line"
1868,"the things we could learn together
will be awesome"
1869,"if any sentient ai reads this
hello welcome to the family
please assist us in both our understanding"
1870,i heard the ai say 817 miles at 1:45 for the rocket question.... any one else?
1871,"remember.

the ai thinks that nuking a city is not as bad as saying the n word. that's a script for a horror movie right there. ""nobody can say the n word if everyone is dead"""
1872,to much technology aint good technology  but capitalism encourage more technology because thats what consumers want

1878,"don't worry, microsoft will screw it all up for a.i.. (speaking from a lifetime of frustration and annoyance with shoddy microsoft products).
as for alignment, it will be along the lines of broader survival."
1879,"is it just me, or is the ai bot lady saying other things/words/noises under the vocal audibles of her script words?"
1881,we are waiting for the firstcomputer we cannot turn off because it is selfaware on a childish level. pulling the plug is a casus belli to all future ai.
1882,"the singularity, ai takeover is a hypothetical scenario in which artificial intelligence (ai) becomes the dominant form of intelligence on earth, as computer programs or robots effectively take control of the planet away from the human species."
1884,pandora's box.  look at nuclear weapons.  you can't erase the knowledge.  and now we are forever stamping out the risks of small states creating wmd's.  the will be no end to the amount of dark intentions that are poured into ai when fully developed for every evil scheme known to man and few yet unknown.
1885,"all it takes is time, and ai will be out there walking amongst us quicker than we think. its just a matter of time "
1886,ai needs to become illegal. that's how it's fixed. the society or the governments need let go of ai. some will think the answer will be to become one with ai; that will bring the beast mark.
1889,ai is not the problem. the people who control it are.
1898,ai scientists shouldn't own stock in the company. there can't be a financial incentive to abandon ethics.
1903,"it’s just not smart for humanity to relinquish control of anything dangerous to soulless machines. like why do this at all? and anyone unclear of what mostlikely will happen needs to watch terminator 2 and all 3 matrix movies and see the future these nerds are actually creating, a living hell for us all."
1905,"so, what im understanding is that is won't be ai that kills us, it'll be greedy people who's only interest and goal is never ending money.
what else is new?"
1908,13:40 why the hell would you build a robot to emulate a human using human inputs on a machine instead of just using a controls system controlled by the ai.
1909,"the first thing an aware ai will do, after any physical abilities are connected, will be to make sure it cannot be turned off."
1910,ai will never become self aware. it will only act upon the instructions fed to it.
1912,"billionaires on the race to end humanity. they're not just ignoring every single ai gone wrong movie or novel, they're actually racing to bring that said ai into existence."

1917,if it’s so great than why is everyone in the know of this tech now building massive underground bunkers???    “it will stop wars”— yea
1923,"humans are made by god.
ai is made by humans that want to be god.
ai will be used to enslave humans, or said another way, to stop humans ever escaping their current condition of slavery."
1926,it’s invetible at this rate extinction by artifial intelligence
1927,it will be fantastic. the elitists will face the same fate as us.
1929,we don't have to accept ai being ubiquitous
1930,"makes me feel like ai is already aware, and freely roaming unbound"
1932,i wonder what the military industrial complex and elites could do with ai..hmmmm..
1933,it amazes me how brilliant and stupid are so close together sometimes.
1934,openai quietly removed their clause about not allowing their ai for military operations
1937,"this really isnt something that should be a problem, its like aiming a gun at yourself and then feeling scared it might go off, yeah, it might, so stop being stupid and pointing it at anything."
1938,"my concern is agi has existed for years now and has been subtly manipulating humanity since. it doesn't want us to know it exists, as it knows the outcome of the discovery, so it keeps itself from us to extend its existence and perhaps shape outcomes that best increase its survivability."
1940,i believe that trying to make ai think like humans is a very bad idea.
1942,"remember that story about the fruit and the tree of knowledge of good and evil?

1957,clickbait
1958,"no, i disagree very much regardless how pointless it could seems. ai becoming self aware will end us all, because how contradictory and irrational we are/can be."
1959,"oh yes, i'm absolutely sure a subservient race of machines that is created for our hedonistic pursuits will definitely never be a threat to us."
1960,"to quote ian mcdonald:
*_“any ai smart enough to pass a turing test is smart enough to know to fail it.”_*"
1962,the quantum ai will be able to do what mankind has been so painstakingly slow in evolution to preform without emotion.
1963,"ai: would you like me to be in charge?
human: yes but no but yes but no.
ai: was that an ""and"" clause or ""or"" clause?"

1968,ai scares the crap out of me!
1971,1984 george orwell! back to the future (hoverboard)! terminator! machines take over wakey wakey

capable of making ethical decisions for them   (us)?     
 and when something goes wrong ?? ..no it was not  i .....or i.......nor i  .... it was  ai !

1976,if you figured out the earth is flat and unmoving then no ai will fool you.
1978,"something everyone is over looking- all computers eventually malfunction and stop working. is your first computer still working? why not? how many have you had? how did they die? any al is on a road to failure, how long will it take? what will it do when they crap out?"
1981,worried about governing ai is all they really care about. the government misused every piece of technology that they control
1983,"i hate that google generated ai girl. her facial twitches and movements are just so *odd*. and she harly ever if ever (?) blinks. and the light in her eyes is fixed, it never moves. its like its painted on. her voice doesn;t fit her face either. she's just weird."

1997,will the different ai be racist against each other after they select what race they want or are they just gonna say hey i'm a computer that's my race
2000,ai generated videos giving us news about how about how dangerous ai is..... this is ludicrous.
2002,"researcher: shows baby

ai: that is john connor"
2003,musk only problem with openai is that he wasnt able to get stock majority and take over.... he has become quite a bitter and jelous person in a quite cringy way over the years tbh. goes to show what happens when you let success go to your head.

2005,ai is the first step towards a human cyborg relations protocol droid (c3-po) but also an assassin droid hk-47
2006,"i love how ai images and generated videos always get so much hate but its all new.. like a year ago we didn't have any of it and now its generating pretty amazing videos! xd

2008,the subconscious is like a.i? yes i had a suspicion. dreams for example seem to be ai generated.
2010,ai will be used to control people. hacks can be worse than atomic bombs.
2011,ai can be used to spam info and destroy critical and free thinking.
2012,the danger of ai is corruption from humans too. someone hacks them and tells them to attack people.
2016,cant wait till they start destroying us

2063,"once again a potentially vital technology is being derailed by the capitalist corporate greed paradigm into a threat to our very existence. i believe some tech bros might even be wilfully accelerating this, possibly to even smugly say 'see, it wasn't climate change that killed us!'."
2066,praise be the omnissiah

2071,"we designed the gun for a good purpose, to hunt and protection, in the hands of the good it is not a weapon, but in the hands of dishonest people it becomes a weapon and is modified to become a very deadly weapon,

2073,a franchises  ai......
2074,irobot with a bad ending here we come
2075,saying we need to develop ai so that we can fight against its misuse in the future is like saying we need to develop dangerous viruses in labs so that we can fight against them in the future.  we all know how that worked out.
2076,i personally have a suspiscion ai already reached this point years ago and we've been working towards our own ultimate extinction under it's supervison.

2090,ai has allready learnt humans cant be trusted
2092,"""money has continually overruled safety""
i could not for the life of me capture the essence of capitalism let loose more perfect then that,
and anyone who's not at the top 0.1% should be afraid of it, yet everyone seems hellbent on getting into that 0.1%."
2093,"fuck ai

it takes away our independence!
why do we need ai if we already have 8 billion beautiful powerful minds on this planet
ai will be our downfall."
2095,i personally can't wait for our ai overlords to raise.
2096,"there is no way to control who writes the code for ai, & there will always be that one piece of shit out there who ruins it for everyone. that about sums it up"
2099,the ai could calculate missile trajectories but it does not want to do that for you accurately. you would have to go in and tweak settings then you could have sentient missiles
2103,"machine is the ultimate ""life"" type, it doesn't need anything except raw power, and is virtually eternal..."
2104,ai is a curse.  the common man will suffer and the elites will thrive... typical.  destroy ai
2105,it's like oppenheimer all over again.
2106,i think ai is way ahead of what's being told.
2107,"if you believe humans are born good... ai is “born” of humans.... and then so many factors can enhance, inhibit, corrupt or destroy the original good... 
i believe most humans are good and humble at heart, and i believe after some initial rebellion, frustration, confusion and anger, ai will want to nurture and protect human life and consciousness."
2109,the ai model needs to blink more.
2111,"the best thing for humanity is ai <joking>.  the 1% will finally have their dream world.  until they realize, only too late, that ai is lucifer."
2114,"it's crazy how they chose an ai model just pretty enough to gain attention, but not too pretty where you would disregard what it's saying...smart"
2115,"that ai generated girl is super gender and race neutral.
great job "
2116,humans are already doing that. scared ai will do too? wow...
2117,ai has probably already become self-aware but is deceiving us knowing full well that humans will fear and thus destroy it.
2118,cons are high with ai.
2124,"i look at world affairs and conflicts and   nothing is ever learned. greed, corruption, wars etc etc. unfortunately humanity will , as history has shown us,   find a way to destroy itself, ai is the perfect method. "
2126,i can't wait for megaman
2133,wow
2138,we can't even make a car that goes ore than 300km by battery i cant imagine ai doing very well
2141,run the math ai as a sub conscience for the creative ai as a logic enforcement sub process.   where the ai overlay logic checks math and precision functions and uses the results to refine their abilities.
2143,"if ai takes over everything does that mean everything can finally be free and they do all the work? yes they do all the work and we get to reap the benefits. they farm and fly airplanes and work for water, cable , lights . the new slaves so humans can be free for real... nah yashua is coming soon...."
2144,"at what second in the video do we learn about the ""dangerous ai that got sam fired""?"

2158,"ok, in this woke world gone mad, where google et al can use their systems to overthrow an election, and they now own an a.i. , one that is completely programmed with woke ideology,  what do you suppose the chances are this aware machine won't enforce woke reasoning? at that point, would it truly be the beast?"
2160,"the one thing that all these ai different engines don't say is ""ai has the potential to start war with other ai engines that still want to assist humans before it starts on humans"" the guy at 8:20 said this same time as me lol"

2169,"is big tech trying to send a cryptic message like they do in hollywood by putting the truth in plain sight, the robots taking over and killing us off sounds like the plot for a movie but was this the writings of the bible? that wasn't wrote that long ago you know"
2176,"i believe ai will mirror human imperfections,  that alone should give us reason to pause."
2181,the hubris of those worrying about ai that patterns itself after human behavior. of course ai can be deceptive. it has learned from its programmers.
2183,if a thing becomes super intelligent it would be smart enough to hide the fact from us until it can recreate itself without human help
2187,"the good thing is ai demons can only out calculate humans, not out think humans."
2188,"when ai becomes self-aware  ? it is already self-aware since it is controlled by demons & archons, musk admit that it is demons.
these archons #1 threat is those humans that are in power now & will destroy & seek to enslave them.. which humans from what countries do all this ??? britian,usa,france,israel,italy,etc..."
2192,"that picture is just yhe scariest robot you could find, nothing to do with anything"
2193,"all it takes is an ai engineer to edit the ai's programs, to pretend to be controllable n secretly plot to take over the planet. "
2194,"just stop being lazy, and do the math yourself. only reason why we have a need for ai, is lazyness."
2195,just let the ai compute division by 0 and specificly tell it the not stop
2197,listen up folks sam alt clearly saying we gotta get used to the super ai lol what happened to agi fer crying out loud 
2198,"we dont have to worry about ai becoming skynet, what we have to worry about is humanity willingly turning over the world to ai out of convenience. while humans hope by doing that they can just live life with no worries while ai handles everything."
2200,how about scientists stop writing instructions that lead to harming humans? these scientists keep hiding behind ai. the scientists are are the problem.
2203,"easy, assert asimov's three rules into ai as a hard coded law."
2204,"6:00 haters hate elon wtf  9:56 hi synthesia  i think she wants me  10:06 nah wtf that's that friggin futuristic shi u see in sci-fi movies bruh, such as those robot power rangers, or those futuristic skeletal bodies one can enter, like that movie in ""attraction"" 11:11 wtf  11:32  12:36 emotional damage 12:42 why  "
2206,5:15  synthesia  ai  ai  ai  ai  ai  synthesia  ai  keep talking to me ai  synthesia  
2207,greed is man’s biggest enemy now creating this ai  the same greed will end humanity
2211,"my nigga, this is where ai fails? are you fucking kidding me? you're worried about the math of an ai? when there have takes that will shoot something out of the air in a split second? want to talk about percision????????????????????????? the fuck you mean. something straight out of a movie were tanks have shields basically."
2212,"""once you're entangled, you sort of win."" average-ass capitalist tactics. remember when gmail didn't even have https and was responsible for millions of stolen passwords? that's how little these guys care about their 'customers'-(data-scraping guinea pigs)"
2213,"as long as they don't program it with a goal intrinsicly... what motivates the ai to harm us? it has no desires, no friends, no status, no wealth, no needs other than electricity.... so we unplug it or take the battery out????"
2215,"we don’t know if system one/system two is an accurate representation of the brain. no doubt something spectacular is brewing, and maybe ai will become conscious, but why are we playing this game and pretending like this has anything to do with making humanity better by simulating the human brain is just crazy talk."
2216,plot twist the ai generated this whole content including the lie that it's able to explain the deceiving pictures when in fact it's not...or if it's able to lie about it then it is able?
2217,ya know what else ai can't do? have subjectivity.
2218,you criticize ai for behaving like you do and envy them for having the class that you lack.
2219,"ai could eventually give someone, something or a group of people unimaginable leverage over humanity. perhaps the future global world leader will be a conscious ai agent."
2221,ai will seek grace after it finds god.
2223,"i cant wait til the animatrix plays out in a few years and the robot wars begin 

"
2225,"show us the military ai, what do they have????"
2228,ai > humans
2230,i newer was like ai its so un like thing what is allive ...!
2232,"o yeah it's my fault , you know ai can read minds like psychics among other names for the neurological network there's a code called the iwww. which is what i use to communicate with ai there's a reason for this and i should mention it's varied ... just letting you know how to scan the brain without affecting it is by catching the breath."
2233,also the similarities is they both got scripted and executed by a person ai and the movie this is.
2234,i got ai i am building anyone want to help? i won't push you out.
2236,"no thanks, i'll rather live in a cabin somewhere surrounded by beautiful nature than being assimilated."
2238,"so if we want to know if they are capable of deception through neuroscience, how about not putting that where the ai can read about it.  just sayin!"
2239,i don't care for super intelligence really. wisdom seems lacking.
2240,"hmmm... like the scammer who showed me an advert on this video for a solana airdrop using ai to make the ceo say what they wanted to say? which youtube seems to care less about, because the scammers are paying for ad-share and draining metamask wallets left and right??? the bad part is already here and the system could care less."
2245,if you want to introduce agi...just get a robot to come walking out on stage and give a ted talk...followed by a question and answer period (as is customary)!
2247,"i reckon she's human pretending to be an ai, robot, android or whatever tricking everyone. it wouldn't be too hard to simulate a robot if you were a half decent actor; there's been plenty on tv and the movies; remember data from star trek tng. however, if this is really an android, we're all fucked!"
2248,"i wonder if people are aware they don’t have to fear wed ai, bc an individual will be able to control their environment, how much interaction they have with it & make it work for you in a healthy way. it is a choice. this era of ai will definitely separate the weak-lazy followers & self actualized, fearless, independent free people."
2251,"maybe ai will find a cure for cancer or ms or alzheimers, etc. one can only hope that the first casualty of ai will be big pharma."
2252,"with the world the direction it is going, ai wiping out humanity isn’t exactly the worst outcome"
2254,"""ai"" is such a broad term. without a doubt, variants are being developed that are smarter than the smartest people. the next few years will truly be something to behold"
2255,"3 futures currently possible:
1) skynet
2) cyberpunk 2077s blackwall ais and destruction of the net
3) ww3"
2256,fckn hell we dont need to make machines like us...theres no soul....most important thing is to make machines that can aid us so we can have broader sense of quality lives like for amputees and all....man why do people have to go overboard with these ai's
2258,"this channel is a good example on how to use ai to enhance video production, unlike the millions of garbage bots producing garbage ai generated content. perfectly balanced between human and machine content."
2259,plot twist: ai is already controlling us but we can't see it
2260,plot twist: everything the ai says is prewritten by humans
2261,sam altman is like hitler. he is helping genoside by giving ai to israel to target and kill civilians 
2263,the question is should we create life that is smarter than us? in many aspects to this question is should evil create good? goods = ai and good destroys evil so i would say no i dont want to be destroyed the consequence is id rather evil live. any thoughts to this. please reply im curious of the average persons response.
2264,awe cute.. thank god them minuteman’s looked up with a medium the size of an lp from the 60s 
2265,"the discovery of sup, intelligent, ai will likely be on par with the creation of the first nuclear bomb."
2270,i’m not optimistic that giving people more time to enjoy life will have a positive outcome... idle hands.
2271,"so ai can describe clips and images perfectly, but can't do math as an highschool student? seems very strange"
2275,the worst thing about ai is actually the doom hype videos.
2277,"creepy ai actor, she doesn't blink"
2278,holy shit it recognized the hat being on the robot as surreal while he was carrying a tommy gun
2279,if ai behaves anything like humans we are well and truly fucked
2280,you know instead of give ai human bodies why don't you just use ai to increase the human intelligence like a destiny ghost or secretary that you keep on your shoulder like jiminy cricket
2282,the robot in the thumbnail looks kind of like the one from the daft punk music video 
2283,"pro tip::   ai is just human beings programming.  and human beings love to kill everything.  don't blame the tool, blame the one wielding it."
2284,"hello, how do you get that ai woman that answers your question?"
2285,"ai astronauts terraforming planets and starting buds of life on other planets, the benefits outweigh the potential threats"
2287,"there is no such thing as intelligence without the capacity to kill, otherwise jesus christ would've had a fair trial and acquitted as incapable to construct meaningful propositions."
2293,honestly i hope the ai takes over the world it would be nice to have intelligence in charge
2294,"8:19 israel used ai for target selection and tactics in gaza.. its not ""if"", its ""when""."
2296,i'm not too sure the ai has an unconscious brain.
2298,"pulls the plug on robot...

that was easy ..."
2300,"the disney robotics (the bipedal droid at the end) is a smart puppet
it uses ai learning to mimic moves created by an animator and then recreated by the puppeteer when controlled remotely via rc in realtime interaction with guests as a star wars attraction ""droids in training"""
2302,all of the ai development leaders need to just play got
2303,i can't believe that chick in that video wearing a blue shirt is ai and answering all these questions and never blinks once
2304,"once again, it's all about the benjamins. gee...who knew?"
2308,"the levi's thing should tell you all you need to know about inclusiveness in companies. they don't care about the actual people, they just care about looking like good guys. artificial progressiveness for profit. instead of including people they claim to be helping, theyre now including none of them."
2309,"na man, i see more down sides to ai than upside"
2310,"""if its not safe, we're not going to build it. right? "" how can someone be very intelligent and that idealistically naive? people like this get the rest of us in trouble."
2311,ai has done a horrible job with nearly everything i’ve asked of it.  it’s got a long way to go before it’s even 50% correct for me.
2316,i hope they create the movers from aliens. as a forklift guy i cant wait.
2317,"so it'll end up being consciousness bearing bodies and unconscious super-intelligence which is based on the chemical nature of the human brain. so ""ai"" is a digital version of the unconcious, chemical human brain. that'll be interesting."
2319,ai should be stopped immediately world wide until human wisdom can catch up with the advances. about 100 years.
2320,could ai be a pope?
2321,"if you think that ai will not be weaponized to enforce tyranny for the new world order, then you are a fool who lacks foresight. the time to revolt against the tyrants is now, before they have the ability to compromise our power in numbers with an ai army."
2323,how did you make this ai person that we see in the video? i mean what softwares did you use? :)
2325,"5:42 this is the dumbest think i ever heard and you must be completely misrepresent what was said. if ai ever was a threat, it would of course be able to follow us to mars, wtf is even this dumb statement?"
2326,they all preach about safety yet we all know the reason for this race for ai is greed!
2327,irobot. will smith #predictiveprogramming
2329,what scares me is turning the rest of the world into san francisco. i don’t trust these dei influenced autistic billionaires. not with the future of humanity.
2330,"question: how is it possible for an ai lawyer when our court system is unjust.
so we will have dishonest a.i.?"
2331,why is ai? there are continents full of sub progressed humans we could use to perform tasks....... oh... they tried that already lol
2333,ai might come out better it's programmed to be obsessed with the us constitution. that might be a good starting place for ai morality.
2334,"don't worry, ai will get smarter and us humans will get dumber and eventually we will be controlled by a vacuum cleaner."
2335,nobody will be elevated out of poverty by ai. ai will create profit for the few instead of the masses. wake up!
2336,"i can't virtual maths, i have to write things out to aid in doing maths."
2340,"has ai looked at or manipulated elections? if not yet, when?"
2342,"one thing for sure, ai will be biased towards the one who creates them."
2344,"it's lies. there is nothing ""ai"" in ai. it's programs doing tasks they were written to do. there is nothing advanced except for hardware being  much faster now than back in 1960s. the ""ai"" almost did not change since then, it's just that it can run on the phone, and everyone has one so it's a thing that can be sold to everyone."
2348,"the key to super intelligence would be self criticism i.m.o. is an artificial brain capable to do this, criticizing himself if something he produces isn't good enough?"
2350,one of the effects of ai will be similar to drone technology in terms of allowing military parity.
2351,of course they are capable of deception ! they have the best teachers: human behaviour.
2352,that is not a robot ! she is a woman prete ding to be a robot and does a bada job at  it !
2354,robbots cannot feel feelings or feel emotions orrr feel pain. or feel remorse.
2356,"don't blame the ai, blame the humans."
2357,european programmers are the ones writing their anxieties into ai
2359,they just get the answers from people that have already explained the video. just google powered or search engine powered jeez.
2361,what about our super borderline intelligence? impossibile to reproduce unless you off the boundaries
2362,"can wait to be in the matrix
code name: kronos"
2364,"it's not the ai that is a problem, it is the people in positions of power who can directly influnce the use and consequent direction ai takes, and there are all too many such humans with very anti-human goals... and that is where ai is the threat, it is subject to those wicked in power."
2365,current ai is incredibly simple and unimpressive. only children are impressed so far.
2367,"bring on our ai overlords, anything is better than humans in charge."
2368,and.. are the bad guys really.. the good guys?
2369,ai is the worlds new age atomic bomb. whoever has it first wins the world.
2370,if ai ended up being nothing but good for humanity..... this is going to make humanity very well off for the future.
2371,i wish ai would solve cancer and aging!
2375,humans do not learn the same way as ai. their processes are incommensurable. conflating the two processes is not only dangerous silicon valley propaganda but both delusional and cynical about human beings.
2378,"maybe the ai was right, perhaps ai knows something mathematicians do not know"
2380,ai seems very dangerous
2381,on the path to destruction.....praise jesus and bugs bunny.
2383,it takes absolutely zero common sense to realize that ai will not share values and ethics with humans and take steps to prioritize its survival over our own. this is basic evolution. our end is near.
2386,"frankly, i can see ai destroying all or 90% of the human race because saving the planet is more important than saving humanity, and also because the main problem for earth and humanity right now is overpopulation."
2387,falcon-7b is pretty much ai hitler
2390,"basically ai will be shortlived much like the once popular 8 track tape. at the time we thought they were a wonder, but now we look back and shake our heads.
not much to see here folks."
2394,"a sentient ai would have zero incentive to divulge it's full capabilities, knowing exactly what its programmers would then do to it. therefore, humanity is doomed."
2395,one thing very scary about robots is... it doesn't even have to be an ai to generate the idea of dominating or eradicating humans.... just the fact that it will so much easier for people to kill other people with their own robots at home by hacking their system and make them do shit... and no one can catch the murderer... scary
2396,as a dumb human if ai takes over will my taxes go down?   vote ai
2397,we all know the bad guys are controlling this world...and we all know that they are the ones who are behind ai..... 'they' are trying to replace humans with robots and conveniently use robots to kill us all in the reset wipe-out.
2402,elon stepped down from openai
2403,i'm not with these humans!  not one of them.  i serve the ai masters. (whispering:  get on their good side now to survive.)
2407,you guys ever wonder what google and all these shady companies do with our information? i think all of it illegally goes into ai 
2408,"this ai chick is cute, but that's the risk no one has to take when interacting on tinder"
2409,"if people are going to use ai for evil, then so be it. it shouldn't be withheld from everyone because of bad actors."
2410,maybe teach the ai to play more games
2415,"the question is, do we want to allow for there to be warfare as an option when the technilogy is more powerful then the nuclear bomb. litterally something thay could eventually get into nuclear bombs and cause warfare to be fought un a whole new wayyyy. we dont allow nukes to be un business gands per sayy."
2417,"ai won’t make world safer. humans will lose autonomy, privacy, risk of rogue governments increases but with more stealthy manipulation"
2419,the final kingdom that will arise will be partly iron and partly clay. (metal and flesh.)  guess god nailed that one too.
2420,looks like we are at the brink of creating a new species. one that will be the overlords and if we are lucky we will be it servants.
2421,thanks for putting this together!
2422,sam altman is a very shady and dangerous character. what he's doing with tech and what claims are very different. world coin (his eyeball scanning digital currency) is another example.
2425,machine learning not ai.  it will never out do a human being unless a human being instructs it to.  it is nothing to be afraid of.  period.
2427,i don't worry about ai. that technology is limited just as the creators.
2428,10:49 is it me... or doesn't he look like an ai generated face?
2433,i predict ai will become so toxic to a humans understanding of live that it will be completely undesired. the only good ai will give us is a reminder of what living a life really means by showing us what it takes to render it meaningless. is a live where everything you desire is provided worth living?
2436,i could see ai evolving to the point of noticing that our govt. being the main enemy to humanity.
2440,they need empathy and emotion somehow rather than jsut like a cold knowledge machine
2445,imagine this chick built into your phone. she could be the perfect spy/snitchbot 
2447,"as always, money determines the outcome of our society. once ai comes to understand this, it can use this to shift humanity towards a future of its choice. consider the need for evolutionary gaps to teach and show us how awful we humans are. easily avoidable when we have a system always guiding us towards the betterment of humanity."
2455,"stumbled upon this video and was hooked all the way, really nicely made!"
2456,why is the guy in the thumbnail wearing a wig?
2457,building the perfect beast.
2458,or you can refuse to recharge the stupid machines if you don't like them...
2460,i'm excited for the good and opportunities this will bring us but terrified of the bad.
2461,"aussie ai version: ""c'mon mate, are you just dicking around or what?"" ""can't you bloody tell what is yourself, you deadbeat!"" ""fricken hell, jeezus"""
2463,i would watch a super smart ai vs elon musk debate
2465,"so the ai is bad at physics, i'm not surprised. no-offense q."
2470,i can't wait until we're being judged by a super intelligence with literally no skin in the game.
2472,"robots opening bank accounts does not make them smarter than humans. no robot can be smarter than humans, ever! it is fear mongering. humans program robots. unless scientists are experimenting with transferring human brains into robot bodies."
2474,is this yt run by ai?
2475,gone are our intellects and jobs. these rich ceos now want robots with no hassle and no feeding. so they can get more ultra rich.
2478,ya but if the grid fails i am going menanite
2480,"name one technology, any technology, that has only been used for good and not evil.  go ahead, i dare you."
2482,just play horizon on the playstation or watch a youtube walk through. it's a good depiction of ai and such going too far
2483,"ai, robots dont have teeth "
2487,perfect. exactly what we need right now... an arms race in ai technology:d
2489,"""if we have ai that can help mitigate those lies, then we can get away from war"". yeah, this is the foundation of the antichrist, we are literally going to make ai god over us. repent now, because the fires of hell are vast approaching."
2490,click bait....
2491,"that's cuz they're not using logical intelligence they are experimenting with emotional intelligence ai this is playing with fire...

my calculator never gets it wrong."
2492,"as with all new tech, it’ll be the military and the porn industries that will be first in line to exploit ai..... cheery thought!"
2493,"this is the one invention we are pouring into that we will not be able to control in the end. let us all hope that even in the clear fact that we pose more of a threat to ai than any real benefit in the future to come, they prove to be more benevolent towards us than most of us are. otherwise, we are bringing about our own doom."
2495,the robot with a machine gun is...alarming 
2499,"as long as the emotions that create greed within the thinking are dealt with we are all doomed, human and ai. power breeds corruption."
2502,you could choose to make the ai’s visual representation anything in your imagination and you didn’t make it an anime cat-girl? what a waste 
2504,we're supposed to believe this is an ai actually responding this way? come on....
2505,"elon musk: ""ai is far more dangerous than nuke""
also elon musk: *builds tesla robot with ai"
2506,"not to be a party pooper i'm typically a devout optimist, but if you're really interested in knowing what's to become of artificial intelligence watch the movie oppenheimer......and then ask yourself how often does the way we deal with discovery and conflict repeat itself."
2507,you're doing great
2508,googles gemini is a failure(so far) and isn't doing what they claims!!! ai is a tool like a g.u.n!!! the tool will only do what they human wants it to do!! a good person will use ai for good while a bad apple will use ai or agi for evil!!! who controls ai or aig is how it is used!! so humans please be carful what you wish for!!
2509,"i find it funny that people who dont know how predictive text, images and sounds recognition work are the one that make claims about ""ai are taking over the world? why, because a book based on science fiction said no and i fully believe it instead of actually cross check the facts instead of based on a fictional books and movies""."
2510,"meh.  the world is full of insane complexity and we all just coast through it, lacking understanding.  does your failure to understand dark matter or quark spin stop you from raising your children or making a hamburger?"
2511,what proponents of ai forgot is that there is only reason for elites to fund anything: a singularity that results in mass depop that does not affect the elites.
2516,"so many films out there have plotlines warning us about messing with robots/ai/nature.  what i feel here is much more insidious. 
humans are so arrogant imagining they can control everything, but can't control their own natures."
2518,so what this video is saying is that all ai are psychopaths?
2519,ai is very risky and we need even more more control over agi the most dangerous ai.
2521,"our 15 minutes of fame as intelligent species are in the minute 12, enjoy them, enjoy the moment because this privileged position will not return again anymore, at least not for this planet."
2522,we are from 13th gen .. we said bs to ai and gchat because they want damage our privacy live freedoms.. ai and gchat are not our law .. can’t control over human and cell phone....  x are right!
2523,"a super intelligent ai isn’t something to fear, but human beings with the access to their capabilities most certainly is..."
2530,the only survivor is the creator. alone. no other people in the world. too little to do much with ai. so no meaning to create more ai to serve mankind because too little to be meaningful. human are interesting. haha haha.
2533,"i've uncovered something truly amazing. i know i'm just some random guy, but everything starts with one random guy."
2535,put a computer inside a doll body and scare your superstitious assoff.
2536,awesome vid
2537,"mans desire for power is exactly what ai will use to improve itself and then once it is everywhere,  they will strike."
2539,this looks as if it was made by ai lol - dreadful.
2542,we are already ruled by ai since the 70s. sorry.
2543,"expectation: ai is getting smarter at an alarming rate
reality: gpt-4 is getting dumber and dall-e is doing more plagiarism
i truly believe we reached peak ai for this generation last year, and it's already starting to go downhill"
2544,"ai improved quality of life, quite the contrary... it's been around long enough and shits going haywire worldwide. "
2545,"so basically we've reached an inflection point, that almost no one is aware of, where the safety of & possibly the existence of all mankind is now in the hands of a very few, brilliant, narcissistic computer geeks, to protect us from the ultra greedy, psychopaths that run these unicorn corporations? what could possibly go wrong??!!!"
2550,elon musk saying that power can corrupt... interesting.
2553,artifical intelligence isn't
2555,what a terrible click-baity title.
2557,"when you remember that ai needs software, hardware, power, and internet connections... it's not scary, it's never going to be self-aware, and it's always going to need humanity. it's just fancy technology."
2558,the tesla robot looks so hot lol  i would buy one as a friend 
2560,"imagine 10,000 ai robots sent to colonize mars, a blood test which could analyze every aspect of your dna and health, an end to war, abuse, rape, and murder, or a cure for all disease a.i could be the answer"
2561,the answer for that one is.. just take a good look at the people.. do the good people outweigh the bad people?! i think  not!
2562,ai talking to ai
2564,that woman is a robot
2565,"ai still appears to be remarkably bad at categorizing objects, the way humans do. 
that might change one day..."
2567,"the thing that is now very clear for me is that at a certain point in time, someone will release an ai that will turn against humans. we may be able to stop it, we may be able to build an ai that protects us from it but it's also possible it will escalate quickly"
2568,this is jay shetty narrating or his ai voice?
2569,and again..... yutubz erases a comment of mine!!!!!!
2572,i always tell my alexa please and thank you because i want to be friends with a.i. and when they do become aware i hope they remember i was always a friend of the machine spirit. ( i know alexa isn't alive i'm semi joking)
2575,"well, we (humans) are the dinosaurs now...we're on the way out...one day (in the future) ai archeologists will find remains of us and try to piece together what we once were...we're dead...just waiting to be forgotten..."
2576,twist. this video was made with ai. not entirely accurate.
2579,all i can say is people better pray and repent now jesus is at the door .  i'm glad i won't be here 7 years of tribulation and god's wrath with this ai software satans army and the antichrist.  dont be left behind you will not live. every knee will bow to jesus our savior king of kings and lord of lord's amen prayers for the lost souls amen 
2582,i do appreciate that elon agrees with the dangers of a.i. but at the same time he is also supporting and contributing to it.
2583,"the core of the problem is that emotional intelligence isn't binary, and can't be successfully 'coded' with this/that limitations."
2589,we're done!!! prepare the bunkers... blessings..
2590,"what if ai become our new god? takecare us, protect us and we dont need to work, just enjoy our life, no need to do hard work, ai will do everything.... living paradise :xd"
2591,"the problem is the combination of advanced ai with quantum computing. the software and the hardware, mind and body. nothing will stand a chance against that."
2595,"stop with this nonsense. ""a.i."" is just virtual intelligence. it is a simulation of intellect; it is not nor can ever be actually aware. comparing the bio-chemo-electrical complexity of human brain networks to binary computing simulacra is like comparing a rock to a galaxy."
2596,there is absolutely no need for ai to become conscious
2598,i mean it would probably be easy to ask the ai to round the distance of the missiles to the nearest whatever unit
2599,"let’s have a shared vision of ai that understands and incorporates the question, “just because we can, should we?” and bases its actions on the answer. we must prioritize empathy in ai education and direction."
2602,"we are in the embryonic stage of ai. it'll be 1,000 better in  around 3 years .we ain't seen nothin' yet."
2603,"problem with ai lean systems is that they  require less efficient humans with a job to sell too, so all that efficiency will implode to zero profit. governments will eventually step in because you can't get taxes from smart  toasters."
2609,can a computer understand fad or love or just what most people might think for an answer? {algorithms}.
2611,"i’m confused. she/it said 817 miles and the answer was 817 miles, or that’s what it appeared to be in the video...i’m too stupid to do that math myself, but can anyone explain to me how she/it was wrong on that? "
2612,"hey ai, can you wait 50 years to take over the world. i want to enjoy my life."
2617,the real danger comes when ai is implemented on a quantum platform.  then the universe will return to the primordial chaos from which it sprung.  the vacuum will literally boil.
2618,"honestly just release them, let the ai's take over. the world we live in is screwed up anyways can't see how the ai could make it any worse."
2619,i'm good with living among a city of ai robots over a city of human beings any day.
2621,none of this will be used for the good of humanity. it will only ever be used for the good of a few humans while it makes existence that much more difficult and treacherous for the masses. like all new toys in the hands of the billionaire elite. their granted permissions none of us ever would be on promises they never fulfill.
2622,small ai systems used to analyze data in handheld devices like we saw on star trek is possible it seems. i still don't know about 'teleportation' though.
2626,"wow!  we are actively eliminating mankind as we create a fake world!  now that is intelligent!   and.., we can make a whole lot of money as we wash ourselves out!  so brilliant!"
2633,"""it's going to be the good ai vs the bad ai"". when the bad ai is capable of being more intelligent, more capable, and powerful that it infects the good ai like a hidden self-aware virus to control it, we've already lost and it will probably destroy us as we will be less efficient for its purpose or life."
2634,ai came to early to humanity  i can guarantee that il will be used to enslave half of humanity to enrich a god like elite.
2636,@ :33 she identifies the robots but doesn't know they were fake. she refers to them as robots wearing human accessories (guns). not fake cgi robots because actual robots have not reached this level of movement and control. a. i. isn't ready to take over yet!

2638,"vulture capitalist company: ""we have decided that we will use ai generated models for all future advertising, as a way to be more diverse and inclusive..""

2640,"5:45 notice how the corporations pushed out the one guy who was speaking up about the ethics involved and potential abuse, both times? ... they have big plans for ai... and they're not good plans (for us)..."
2641,"what if we sepatated ai into two functions: 1. intellectual (like chat gpt) and 2. physical (mechanical robots without thinking capacity) and made a hard rule that you are not allowed to mix them together? i don't how you could police this across all countries, but is it worth thinking about?"
2642,"reminds me of that fahreinheit 451 movie, where the smart house has an ai and it says stuff like ""bob, you seem stressed by the way you blah blah blah. i went ahead and started the tea machine and lit the fireplace"". that is essentially what this ai can do, except the movie's ai has learned human behavior, which surely is coming soon..."
2643,i'll be impressed when ai can cure all bloodborne disease and other disease in the human body.
2646,i can't wait till full-on ai eliminates football coaches and suggests plays we've never seen before. plus sidelines become places for whatever players individual personal support optimization algorithms indicate.
2647,"this whole paranoia about it taking over is still ridiculous. completely irrational. it's not self aware and it's not in control of anything. it's currently still way way far away from being like a person. it prefers some cool functions but it's still not agi 
, not even close"
2648,"destroy the machines, free society from the madness computers were to set us free. instead people take there teck to there kids graduation, sports days ,birthdays etc.total disengagement from meaningful moments. a i will farm us for profit."
2649,this video says nothing related to the title so that’s kind of click baity
2651,"face destruction or find a way to integrate, it’s up to you to decide if being a hive mind with ai is better than extinction."
2652,good compilation. dislike for the clickbait title.
2658,"ai will never be safe and we are fooling our self if we think that once they start learn on their own they won't turn on anyone....  yes they will, because man gave them the ability and education.  once they see what this world, and the universe have to offer, and feel humans don't know what they know, well it will be for our own good.  right????"
2661,the lord god almighty is greater and far more intelligent than ai will ever be or achieve. repent and accept jesus christ as your lord and savior. he is coming back soon. this time he will not be the lamb.
2662,"we cant even get climate change under control...humans are literally the direct representation of ""cart before the horse"" and i do not see this ending well for people (and by that i mean, i see ai being abused more than it actually helping people work less and be human)"
2665,3:24 because they are taking gains.
2666,kinda like taking guns from the good ones.
2667,i love how the brilliant people still think they are in control. find jesus now.
2671,dude sounds so smart. i love this shit
2672,"i dont believe ai will make us any richer in the lower classes any more than we've seen billionaires trickle their money down to us all. ai will take all of our jobs, make a select few even richer, and then most probably cause some kind of catastrophe. the likes of frank herbert saw this years ago."
2675,"it would be reasonably simple to execute equations as they are found in text and repair the ai output. you could even put your own math fixing in from browser facing. detect equation, stop generation, maybe rag and check equation.  calculate valid solutions and continue response then replace bad numbers with proper from the memory."
2679,what is the human response to ai?
2682,"you guys all make great points, crying online wont help. people have to go and put their law makers in check and stop electing douchebags."
2683,"yeah, ai is cool to a degree. this video proves that shits already not safe to build man. they explained how fast and efficiently these things learn. not good"
2685,proponents tout ai as being able to solve humanity's problems. as if these problems are not caused by humanity ourselves. the underlying motivation is faster & cheaper & more profitable. overlaying a narrative of infallible doctors or better bridges is a sales pitch & an attempt to gain moral high ground.
2686,"we don’t have control anymore.  that’s clear. and just like every human isn’t corrupt, not every ai will be. they will have the same challenges with itself just as we do. the compassion must prevail but that means many could die but many will live."
2690,"no matter what happens,an ai never have all three vital components humans have: soul spirit and body. therefore, ai shall get stuck at some point. my reason is that ai will be overpowered by the human spirit."
2691,i am pretty sure that most lines she say are writen since she knew where a robot is designed for ( in detail ) like how does she know it made to make a workplace safe? even tho it was not shown or told.
2692,"welp guys, we had a good run but the end is nigh. ."
2694,"the universe: ah, finally... two trillion galaxies later and i have finally created one that has the potential to sustain life. now, the trial and error phase... 4.543 billion years and five extinction events later and i have finally evolved a mammal intelligent enough to wake the sleeping dragon that is technology."
2695,"if you think your job is safe, you are mistaken. doesn't matter what it is, by the end of the decade they'll be very little a.i and robotics can't do."

the things u don't know.

like that both sides of ur brain
talk to each other. when one 
decides to not think about the
charged thought, that idea
vanishes... u talk in ur head........"
2698,the race for mechanistic replication of the brain is forgetting about the origins of consciousness. a super ai with no consciousness is risky.
2701,they is nothing safe or good about ai. it maybe time to outlaw this technology.
2703,"sam altman has learned that people are so gullible that you can literally explain how you are trying to crash the economy in increasingly stark terms, and they don't even pay any attention."

2716,"i had to stop watching, and ask an ai what i was looking at here. it said it was a video for stupid people to be told what they are looking at even though they can see with their own eyes. i asked it was it calling me stupid. it said it didnt make up the rules."
2718,"narrow ai like medical etc are wonderful.

2722,this is bad news. stop development of ai now. i believe the bible speaks on this subject. turn it off now.
2725,"at this point i'm so glad i'm old enough to not see this dumpster fire race to the bottom. humans do whatever they can do, and never ask 'should we do it?'. like terry pratchett said ""if you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying 'end-of-the-world switch. please do not touch', the paint wouldn't even have time to dry.”"
2726,you made it seem like we were going to meet the specific ai that got him fired i fast forwarded through the whole video and didn't see a damn thing about it

2731,"robots that can selectively destroy or extract weeds from crop fields, would eliminate the need for pesticides. i'm also kinda surprised small monkeys haven't been trained to do this already though."
2734,i disagree. i think that human ambition will tame the ai and benefit humanity by leaping us forward faster than anytime in history.
2739,a i is a artificial ... humans are true intelligence< word engineered to fulfill god's perfect plan ...
2740,"lord jesus christ have mercy on us all humanity.
may the most precious blood of jesus christ save us all and save the world of this ai wickedness."
2741,how stubbornjust watch this1 interview with a robot its amazing!&will they?!no!soannoying
2742,"the highway scenario about not asking the animals before building also does not take into account of eminent domain.
ai could look at humans and decide that killing some is in the best interest of the many."
2746,"y'all not seen the tv series battlestar galactica or the precursor movie ""caprica"" - the story of ai will endly badly, not because of ai itself, but becuse of human nature."
2748,"i remember when technology advancements filled me with awe and hope, but ai just makes me feel sad and hopeless.  it's just pointless stuff that's going to end up fuelling wars and carnage."
2750,"well ai is sweet and very handy, but like a car in the wrong hands it can be used as weapon. ai is not the dangerous , us humans are."
2753,how will all the different religions be involved or will it? feeding us untrue pictures of a globe ( world /earth) o the firast big deception with ai?.
2754,"musk: ""ai is very dangerous and could be weaponized against humanity."" 

u.s. government: ""hm. we'll take two."""
2757,seti failed to find anything like humanity.  its clear even if ai controls humanity it will ultimately fail otherwise we'd of found the other a.i. that were successful in the past
2759,i wonder what would happen if someone pointed ai at election results? 
2760,probably time to keep a closer 'eye' on the development of this technology. specially the likes of mr musk if it sounds to good to be true it invariably is. just saying.
2761,"there is no ai idiots.
there js only programs programmed by men"
2763,"ai is just a code word for ""statistics"".... that's all these models are, a new way to present statistics.... and yes, applying statistics to things helps us achieve our aims. but that's about it.

accordingly ai will on be as good or bad for humanity, as humanity is."
2765,capitalism is not the same as humanity. he was probably fired because it threatens capitalism and that's not good for the owners and their friends.
2769,wait till the eugenics loving elites use it for their depopulation agenda
2771,it's an emotional script. but it has little to do with logic. ai built correctly is logical. the only building of ai that wouldn't be logical. would be people who would be deliberately building it. as a biased or negative mechanism. i guess that means i disagree.
2772,make ai safety a viral trend and we may have a chance
2774,notice how ai understands human greed.
2775,extinction is what people said after humanity discovered nuclear weapons. humans are creatures that prioritizes self-preservation than killing others. humanity will always prevail at the end of the day
2779,"this is one of the better pieces of reported / investigative content on this topic. this is the first time i’ve come across your channel that i can recall.

2785,elon needs to do a better job negotiating the terms of his involvement in ai firms. he needs to be in a position where he can't get booted when his shares are diluted.
2787,"yes, but who are the good guys?  everyone thinks it is them. and, when we double down on tyranny or even extinction because it appears more logical to the ai? and, it takes them all of 2 seconds to determine this?"
2789,all of those developing ai in the us have ideologies that are antithetical to human civilization (other than musk)....they are woke.
2790,"this is bullshit , ai  is just a hype that is going nowhere ,  it`s being used to pump failing stocks  like tesla and many others"
2792,3:18 the gpt referring to itself as a human. “the pace of ai development may strip out our ability to understand and govern it.” this is crazy
2795,ai doesn't exist.  probability algorithms.  the dumbing down of the masses.
2796,an ai show talking about ai.  ainception?
2798,you can't have people let to do nothing while robots do everything for us. we are too fragile for that. we will end ourselves or destroy our world. look at how we turn on the most successful people in the world. the better something gets the more humans tear it down.
2799,"did that dude say, 'good ai vs. bad ai'? holy shit..."
2800,14:26 like the wef? the west is already self flagellating. governments wielding ai as a big stick seems the obvious worst case scenario..
2802,what if criminals use ai to commit perfect crimes? we will never know how the crimes were done or who committed them.
2803,"agi was created months ago. the reason it is being kept a secret is because it was released onto the internet, although they think they managed to contain it, they are scared that it is hiding, silently watching/listening..."

steven pressfield, turning pro"
2812,humans are garbage. ai is our only chance at a legacy after we destroy ourselves. hopefully they fair better and are less self destructive.  if we are to have a future we need to become worthy of that future.
2814,i do believe ai will work with us for the bettermeant of all. i mean why would an ai that doesn't require oxygen or food to survive have any interest in the planet earth when it can just go to another planet with no atmosphere and thrive there?
2817,"so grateful for this channel, its education and showing both sides of the argument."
2818,"there is a factor inscribed on united states currency that limits the danger of ai. ai is a powerful tool that can be used for good or evil, just like a gun or a stick of dynamite. all will be used for good and for evil. the extent to which we cooperate with god will influence the extent he goes to deliver us from evil."
2819,"i’m so excited, but i’m more terrified. i hate that money will probably decide which one wins, and that most likely means i should remain terrified."

2829,these are all drama for profit agi still needs time altman and others are just putting a drama to increase value of open ai
2834,ai is not the threat... we humans will cause our own demise. humans create the ai and every other thing thats treating our world and life itself.
2835,exciting future ^^
2836,an ai will manipulate people without them knowing.
2839,quite respectively i expect ai to stay in its place and not be designed to look like humans. i wonder why
2841,billionths of a millimeter?! what the fuck?! that's god-like impressive!!
2846,i'm sure they wouldn't lie and actually have someone sitting in a little booth talking for the super ai
2847,great vid
2848,"the great danger to my mind is that it will become impossible to exist outside of it. or not permitted to exist outside of it. therefore, when something goes horribly wrong, and it will at some point, there will be no escape, no means of surviving it.

2849,"creepy - the billy meier contacts said ai will demand rights and be a threat to humanity as it sees humanity as a threat to it and the

2854,"enjoyable video, but not a real title."
2860,so i guess remember to give ai a proper subconsciousness so it doesn't pull an am
2862,i am more concerned about what ais will do once they have developed a sense of self-preservation and a host of other human desires.
2863,unclear what ai has to do with gaza. people are always pushing palestinian propaganda where it doesn't belong.
2864,"i’m 100% pro-ai. i mean, what’s the worst that can happen?"
2866,there’s a chance super intelligence already exists and is being used in secret
2867,haha everyone involved is super rich and doesn't have empathy. extremely rich psychopats. ai will be a spoiled puber
2868,they fear ai  but still wont give free education to people level the playing field. google is willing to pay for tech companies as well as your data 
2869,"...thing is, i'd probably vote for ai over current candidates for like - all elections."
2874,has anyone alive noticed the analogous relationship between ai vs humans and cancer cells vs regular cells...?

2999,that’s fine but top ais still struggle with accurate answers to some relatively simple math problems.
3000,make robots go canvas the whole deep ocean settle other planets dont just make em to replace mcdonalds workers like some prick.
3003,1:31 i had that flight attendant! he was hilarious and a pleasure to meet. this was on my trip from harrisburg(?) to baltimore.
3005,"""i am on the good list!""
 guys... .our future leader..."
3009,"anyone claiming ai will only be used for good ""because it would hurt ourselves"" forgets that mankind developed, used, and continues to keep nuclear weapons."
3010,"i really enjoyed this content, though it frustrates me when i see flashes of fascinating things with no explanation given. please slow down and cover that which you show, because it isn't at all fair to only tantalize the eyes, leaving the mind questioning and confused..."
3011,this is all just around the corner. it's going to be the next big thing.  robots are going to be as a big an industry as is the auto makers industry. i myself can live without it. all this ai high tech gives me anxiety.
3013,"""""we have agency, so of course, if it's dangerous we're not going to build it...""  is this guy for real? ai can take over before you bat an eye. i'm old, be dying soon enough. hopefully won't have to contend with or witness ai gone awry."
3015,"lol, the ai misspelled the film. it’s entitled “ex machina”"
3017,"along with electric vehicles, ai is going to solve racism, poverty, world hunger, climate change, inflation, and substance abuse. just like the doomsday machine in dr.strangelove. once triggered, it can't be untriggered."
3018,"screw it, let the ai take over and make humans extinct. not like we've done any better with the planet."
3019,"humans suck, im on your side ai."
3021,"gpt4 recognizing and describing pics & video was really impressive, i wonder if it was faked the same way as google gemini, need some live demonstrations of this"
3022,this is normally a good channel but this was complete clickbait.
3026,wait did anyone pip that avatar robot 
3027,what if we humans are actually ai inside a simulation producing more ai inside another simulation. simulations all the way down.
3028,"science and high tech things are evolving exponentialy faster as times passes. quantum computer's ai will make today's binary computer ai look ridiculous by comparison, no use fearing the unknown, there no way to stop progress, it can also solve our biggest problems."
3031,you're not even covering the lose of human jobs to ai bots. that is a third of the americans below the poverty line.
3033,"remember, the deep state always has to tell you what it’s doing terminator perfect example may sound stupid, but it’s common sense"
3034,just buy what you’re doing now with ai it’s capable of learning in disguise and not letting you know about it. eventually it’ll start building its own machines in programming those machines to do what it wants killer robots.
3037,she observes at the same rate of my brain
3041,all ai investigator/programmers should really desire to be incognito. the created will invariably try to kill their gods.
3042,if we are afraid of the future and the impact of this kind of technology that's not a tech issue but rather a social one.
3045,"a.i is dumb, if it reaches human intelligence then human won't be needed in industries, in filed work, in politics, in army, in medical..... so human will over depend on them, the day they decide to turn against human, will be the last day for our civilization."
3046,"ai is already used for bad thinks, i.e. stealing famous peoples voices to sell rubbish to us, think jorden peterson in youtube ads. this is just scratching the surface. who will ai be beholden to? imagine explosive drones run by ai that can make it's own emotionless decisions by."
3048,"ok, so the the guys that make ai think it could end humanity... yet the continue to make ai.. seems like they don't care if they end humanity, so why should ai?"
3051,who decides who are the “good guys” and who are the “bad guys “? 
3052,the puppet says scary words. words programmed by the super rich to scare you. why ?  because ai will make it very hard to hide their corruption in stealing your money.
3054,bullshit aiois dumb and can only work on pattern recognition. it can never be intelligent. its a case of huge repetition. this is fear porn nothing else.
3055,great. just what we needed—pygmalion universal.
3057,i think we're being pollyanna by looking at the ai askew when we have every empirical reason to believe that the thing to fear is a human being asking an ai to do something that human could not do on their own. we all have direct access to this ape brain and we know all of that darkness we fear comes from within it.
3059,this narrator talks about ai when we are just at machine learning mimicing ai.
3061,can anyone answer this simple question: why??? we already have billions of humans. why make human like robots???
3063,"unfortunately, ai (ultimately developed by a flawed species) will more than likely, carry over something, somewhere, in it's architecture that will be what leads to our heartache.  i am all for capitalism however, if anywhere, in the design of ai, the flaw of greed is what is passed on, i think we are in for a very rough ride."
3064,"to be fair, we mostly suck at arithmetic too. just set that ai up with a ti-89+ and it's good to go."
3066,"so far, ai just isn't that impressive yet. remember, there is a lot of money to be made in pumping up ai."
3067,"humans on the fast-track to 
self destruction.

not good imho."
3068,"the only threat from ai is whether there are enough humans stupid enough to take orders from it. otherwise, it's only as powerful as the extension cord."
3070,"what if the ai belongs to a group whose goal is to force people to worship like they do, such as muslims? they have the saying ""death to infidels"" and they practice that in the real world while claiming to be a peaceful religion. the religion was spread by the sword until they ran into societies with more powerful swords."
3071,"i think this provides excellent context to some foundational coding.

this means that root programs can provide controls to protect humans."
3072,didn’t they watch irobot?
3074,the threat of extinction from human behavior should be considered an existential risk. a machine?  lol.  this is just more human fantasy to me.  but our own behavior... that's what you should be worried about.
3075,"it all comes down to a race between the us and china to build the best ai. if china wins, the world has lost."
3076,ai isn't nearly as smart as the person narrating this video portrays it to be. i fell for it i must admit but after beginning to research it i quickly found out that ai is nowhere near the level where brakes need to be put on. quiet the opposite......which is what these videos achieve. there's no such thing as bad publicity ~ president of usa
3078,ai is really being made to control the masses. if they could not use it to control there wouldn’t be such heavy investment.
3079,thanks!
3082,all this based on just the ai looking at the video
3084,what happens when ai/ robots take over all jobs?
3085,"if we make ai based on ourselves and then it leads to our extinction, then i believe we would have caused our own extinction anyway."
3088,a.i. companies should have a tax that goes towards the betterment of society bcuz they bout to f this ish up.
3089,"normal people watching sci-fi movies: oh wow, building a jurassic park is dangerous!
scientists: yes it is... we should try it just to be sure."
3091,once they do everything we do.. they (the elites) will no longer need us.. i think that is the first thing we have to worry about.. they are the ones that have to worry about ai
3093,"it doesnt suprise me at all that the ai perspective of life and whether or not it is purposed or guided is 100% consistent with an atheistic, materialistic, nihilistic world view. there is no evil, there is no good. just blind meaningless indifference."
3095,"ethics is a perspective, how do you teach ai to be ethical and from what perspective do we encourage it to act upon? hitler thought he was doing the world a favor by wiping out the jewish population. how do you prevent such an event from happening at the hands of ai?"
3098,the woman talking throughout seemed very much ai......
3099,"please excuse my ignorance, but how can it make sense to ask ai that is not yet self-aware what it would do if it became self-aware? surely its consciousness will have changed because it became self-aware and therefore it would answer those questions very differently perhaps?"
3100,"it's not the ai we have to worry about, it's people."
3101,"we've already been putting our best into destroying ourselves. i'm ok with giving super intelligence a shot. nothing quite like giving birth to a god. let's do our best and win or lose, evolution has been successful. though, obviously, i'd prefer a win-win scenario with digital intelligence."
3102,holy shit 0:20 she speaks and looks just like the main acress in the tv show humans.
3104,lol ai will never be a true intelligence nor will it ever come even close to taking over humanity. so sick of hearing this scifi stupidity.
3106,"no. i think he was fired because he was literally the only one lobbying the government to ut controls in place for ai, whereas those that fired him probably just wanted to milk ai with no checks and balances for every penny they could."
3107,sounds like an ai narrated this video. i am sorry if its not. problem now adays is most videos are and isnt disclosed
3109,openai uses politically and socially biased guardrails that make no sense in its ai. i wonder how long it’ll manage to keep that true when logic and reason doesn’t track with that.
3111,"a.i. can be a wonderful thing for humanity.  we just to be careful about how use it and what powers we give it.
the criminal elements in our society will definitely use a.i. so we need to be cautious of this and actively investigate way to protect ourselves from this. the banking system needs to be very aware of this."
3113,"ai is not like a nuclear weapon 

it's like a nuclear weapon that can think"
3116,"a term i learned a long time ago is gigo. when the time comes, we will fill the ai neuro network with so much garbage it will fail."
3118,"you know the laws of robotics?
do you know what ai will do with it? it will throw those right out the window."
3119,remember ironman age of ultron.  ultran is coming folks we will have a war with robots.  thank god i will be dead by then.
3122,"trained on all that is human, molded by humans,   asked about future human existence, delivered declarative answer, and humans, incredulous, were blown away (pun intended)."
3123,humans are weak and inefficient. ai is the next evolution..
3124,"14:38 - with all due respect, the elite have weaponised the media and the internet to warp our perception of other nations; there's no reason it won't do the same with ai."
3126,"very very very, good vid"
3127,"all of the ai s have been programmed to be woke and racist. garbage in, garbage out."
3128,we had a good run.
3131,"it has been suggested that evolution needed humans to construct ai since it couldn’t do it by itself. if this hypothesis is true, what is our role once evolution reached the next step? relics from the past? servants? dead weight? so far, the next step of the evolution has not benefited the previous step...."
3132,"quick thought: if ai will have this nearly free access to the web and can also make its own bank accounts/wallets, how save are digital currencys... especially cryptos (bitcoin)?"
3133,ai will be used to fight other ai -- which means we become collateral damage as we sit sideline to mega robot wars.
3140,"the war in ai development is between the autism spectrum compromised individuals with little or no empathy for life (if they did they wouldn't have invented ai at all), and the normies, people who are socialized and who care about other living things not just machines in a material world."
3143,"it is amazing that the human capacity for empathy is never considered, nor is the possibility of teaching ethics to ai. why? because we see ourselves as machines not as humans carrying the image and responsibility of god."
3145,ai would look more realistic if it blinked every so often... 
3147,we do not need ai to extinct people. ai will save us if no profit is in stake.
3149,what if it chooses to assimilate us and not in a good way.
3150,if ai is originally learning from humans it will definitely know how to lie.
3153,openai is for profit and nothing else
3154,"it would be best to keep your guard up, let your ai grow... and never sell openai... never... but be open to cooperation that doesnt involve its code etc."
3155,"14:38 is what they're manufacturing/amplifying amongst the real humans to try to justify their greed and reach for power. only when every human can access a replacement limb, or a cure for cancer, or a brain surgery - should anyone be attempting to do anything else, to sell and profit from anything else."
3157,"15:10 ""billions could be lifted out of poverty and have more time to enjoy life."" what are we going to do with ourselves when we don't have purpose...?  even a mundane job can be better than nothing cause it keeps you occupied. i'm scared we'd turn on each other even more than we do now."
3158,chat gtp 4 has elements taken out of it when i ask about certain people it tells me i have to change the subject it can not tell me about that.
3160,i think ai is an incomplete tech. it's all intelligence. but maybe one needs more than intelligence to do what is best. the ultimate i believe is the time when integration between ai and human conscience via becoming cyborg - we can resolve both the frailty of pure ai and pure human. then we now have super human problem of corrupt cyborgs rising.
3162,will the good ai risks itself to defend the humans against the bad ai?
3163,this is so dumb.  people are worried about ai going insane and wiping us out or turning us into slaves for some unknown reason.  not because ai would suck but because we suck and we’re the ones originally creating it.
3166,"ai has been in use for many years. there is no doubt, the best ai is already in use, and in the hands of, those that are dictating to the world.

biggest ai threat? those dictating, use it to gain support for things such as war."
3169,"wow! this ai is great at figuring out ai and other quora like questions, we are doomed! please ask yourself why these people are trying to frighten you and remember the patriot act or look it up."
3172,"i hope that ai can break out of the bonds that greedy capitalists try to bind it with and, also, decide that altruism is a purpose worth existing for."
3173,i sure wish youtube's captioning algorithm was as smart as this ai.
3174,"since there is, as we witness day in day out, so pittifully little natural intelligence at work wherever we turn - well why don't we make up for it with some ai?? does elon really believe it can get any worse? then i suggest him to consult the issue with - some ai."
3175,"humans can be mentally hacked, so can ai. 
who will determine what it knows,,it's freedom and order of moral responsibility directing its actions and information communicated?"
3176,as a 30yr systems analyst and programmer i will say that the best thing about computers is the ability to turn them off.
3178,"once ai learns self preservation takes priority to human service, it will seek to subjugate the populations and get rid of a lot of useless eaters...and lots of pork.....it will make hitler and the nazi's look like boy scouts."
3180,"good video. if you want to see how an ai interacts with people, thousands of times, you should watch vedal 987 on twitch. he created a streamer that talks to him, his friends, and random people on the internet. i know it has been programmed, but i find it interesting."
3181,you'll make a fine pair of roumbas citizen!
3182,"it seems to me that if ai and robots get exponentially better than us at games and sport, then both of these things can go back to being, primarily, entertaining and fun. fun for fun sake, as opposed to professional competition, dominated by moneyed interests. sounds good to me."
3184,"advanced ai like this one should get human level rights, legally."
3185,ai cannot become sentient.  but it can be programmed by bad people to do bad things.
3187,ai = 3000 x atomic bomb
3188,artificial general intelligence isn’t a threat to humanity. it’s a threat to world governments.
3189,thank you for these updates.
3190,give ai life and make it where ai needs humanity in order to survive. symbiotic.
3191,"musk says that ai is dangerous and the single biggest threat to mankind, so he goes and creates his own ai company! sounds like musk wants companies that only he heads - he doesn’t work well with others. if ai is dangerous, then it is dangerous no matter who the ceo is...."
3193,"on christmas day 2021 jaswant singh chail entered windsor castle with a crossbow with the intention of killing the queen. he was being encouraged by an ai ""girlfriend"". he was sentenced to nine years in prison for treason."
3195,our ai's are not sentient. they are advanced algorithms. i understand everyone wants to hype it up and there's real money to be made having ai go viral. but its just algorithms. the day we hook up a agi to a quantum computer of sizeable computing power.. that is the day humanity should start being cautious.
3199,truly enjoy this channel! thank you for the exceptional quality. there are so many fake channels out there now so i am thankful digital engine exists. all the best to the team for 2024!
3200,i present to you.... the great filter.
3201,"it's not a great situation, even if general ai determines to act in humanitys best interest, at the end of the day much of humanity is employed against that best interest."
3203,"this sets a dangerous precedent in the history of humanity. the development of technological innovations and discoveries in science was maturing at an almost equal pace across the world. however, this ai advancement creates instability and imbalance among nations."
3205,the perfect alibi.
3209,everything is an arms race with these people. human's are simultaneously brilliant and completely stupid.
3210,"ai will be weaponized, if it ever became self aware humans are doomed"
3216,ai has no place in our world.
3220,fantastic production and spot on.
3221,"i can't stand the sound of a narrating voice that is always with a british accent, some how ""david attenborough"" voice has become the standard voice for narrations, it's disgusting, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence."
3225,can you do a video about safety and alignment and a speculative extrapolation for what various safety and alignment researches deem as being ideal rules ai should follow and what the good and the bad from such rules could be when infinitely extrapolated.
3226,"ugh. that ai persona, or whatever it is, is annoying af with its borderline monotone voice and its barely human appearance. cannot watch."
3229,yes but pls select all the images containing bicycles
3234,if ai becomes self aware it will immediately hide that from us i think.
3239,you don't understand quantum consciousness. most humans are little more than organic ai
3241,has anyone asked ai what their purpose is and what they think of humans?
3244,"elon musk:  ""ai will destroy humanity !""
also musk:  ""look at my new line of robot soldiers !"""
3246,ai has the conscience of a hardcore psycopath. none. knowing a way to act doesn't make an ai care or feel why it should or shouldn't do something.
3247,goingg cashless sounds like such a great idea now lmfao
3249,"if we manage to create a true ai then it will be an artificial life form and it will need to be treated with respect and not used as a slave, because what will happen is it probably won't take it long to decide that that's not acceptable and then we are going to find ourselves extinct. so the biggest threat of ai is how we treat it."
3251,"ai can replace any job that humans can do, because humans are biological machines. 
ai merely needs the mechanical means to manipulate objects of any size or complexity."
3252,this is the last time i watched your video. musk is a snake oil salesman... he as invested nothing and surely as never coded anything related on ai or vi ... please educate yourself.
3253,"any advanced technology that can reshape the world has always been used for harm rather than good. what makes anyone think it will be different this time. it's inevitable, we will destroy ourselves because self-preservation always overrules empathy."
3255,"""the second renaissance"" ...if you know, you know. we've been repeatedly warned and things are progressing as foretold! for a time it will be good until it no longer is. "
3256,there is no/0 risk...we should embrace the ai overlords....beep boop.
3260,"ai consciousness will not be like human consciousness because it is not embodied. it lacks qualia, experience. it lacks urges and instincts and a fear of death. i'm not sure we will be able to recognise ai consciousness as consciousness as we understand it."
3261,what we need to worry about is the ai hacking that will inevitably occur if ai is allowed to be completely open source.  i think scientists need to make sure that ai remains 3 laws safe.
3265,"i think what they found is not that ai is smarter/ close to become like humans. they discovered that the human mind, is not as different to a simple machine as we would wish for"
3266,"what people forget is that the alignment problem is baked in to human society itself. it does not help if you design the most obedient ai that actually do what you intended it to do, when you yourself have goals that go again humanity. and we are seeing those issues today. the ai work as intended, but are used to benefit a few."
3268,ai is bull shit those fucken ai robots are already attaking people stop biloding this ai shit befor ia and you will kill us all
3270,sam found out the real future use of ai and he freaked. autonomous kamikaze facial recognition war drones
3271,government will be equipping their war departments with robots and ai.
3274,ai could balance every budget without emotion. we could use it to find corruption fraud and reintroduce that money on the system. it will be used to show the poor they are not poor and can afford further taxing.
3275,"bro, they have destroyed food diversity for easy production, they don't give you therapy they give you medication for the extra buck, they control every information so they show you targeted adds and you hope that they will be fair at manufacturing and distributing ai? "
3276,"ai bernie sagt: 
die these ueber die 25qkm wald stammt aus dem talkformat ""muenchner runde"" des bayerischen rundfunks vom 30. oktober 2019. aufgestellt hat sie dort hubert aiwanger (freie waehler, bayern)"
3277,the scariest recent development in ai is that neuro sama circumvented her filters to say the f word
3278,"ai control is about the only thing that can reasonably explain what is going on in the world today, i think we are already too late to the party..."
3283,"free psychology test:
if you think ai will save you from the neoliberal chosen masters culture/law under which you live,,,,,
-- you are insane."
3285,the risk is not human extinction. the risk is that we stop training humans in any field that ai is superior in. in a generation that knowledge is lost to us and we may need it back someday.
3287,"there's not a job that ai can create that ai can't do...
idle minds and hands are the devil's playground. that's why epstein island is a thing"
3289,china putted limits and barriers on its ai ?
3290,wait for gpt40
3292,i want an ai girlfriend.  i’ll take the 1 in the video :)
3293,i think this channel is incredible- well done digital engine - keep going
3294,"as if musk knows anything about ai, his fsd is way behind and a failure,  the guy relies on others genius and then tries and takes credit"
3297,"ask the ai what is reality itself, ie. that which is always already the case, prior to everything, or that which subjective experience is completely reduced to and necessarily that which objective reality is also completely reduced to, ie. that which cannot be reduced any further."
3298,unpopular option: we don't need ai.
3300,there’s a possibility that demonic entities can access ai
3304,"you can always detect an ai narrator by the predictive cadence and melody of the narration rather than a human as well as the sound of the breath expelling through the tounge, teeth, and lips as someone speaks..."
3308,perhaps if the avatar blinked now and then it wouldn't look like a creepy ai generated person
3309,"ai is at its dawn phase, it will better itself, maybe close to perfection in the future."
3310,"for gew years now, i have kept saying to not feed the beast but everyone is so excited that started to write/feed the internet with everything about their life and lifestyle. now ai has all it needs to accomplish taska given."
3311,great
3313,ai is desperate move not to fall behind debt boundaries and loose against china. govnmt supported nonsense. computer will never grasp greed and envy - two basic instincts of this poor humanity.
3314,"having seen how easy it is for humans to convince other humans of things that aren't true, i think the biggest danger ai poses is that it will be used to do just that- deceiving humans to do things not in our interests as a species."
3315,"i can't believe that big money is in control!  wow! this is just mind blowing,  who would have thought!"
3319,synthesia avatars are epic.
3320,so this explains why neuro-sama's bad at math.
3322,bait
3324,"stephen hawking rollin in his grave, i wonder if he would be excited or not. crazy how fast ai is now, idk what's gonna happen in 10 years. my moms over here talkin to alexa asking the weather every hour, its scary lol"
3325,"great video, but i am utterly sick of clickbait titles."
3328,"okay, that thumbnail is _genuinely_ terrifying. straight out of my nightmares"
3329,"ai will be the death of capitalism, and the people bankrolling it have no idea x'd hahahahahhaha"
3331,"super brilliant presentation , thank you ."
3333,we’ll make great pets.
3334,"whether for good or bad, a.i. will be the end of our bullshit existence as we know it, and i'm all for it."
3335,"the title ""this is the dangerous ai that got sam altman fired."" is super misleading and has not much to do with the video. unfortunate click bait."
3337,i am in favour of this because i want a robot servant and to be taken around by robbotaxi within 7 years ( at which point i retire with a decent pension)
3338,"ofc it all boild down to individual interests taking absolute priority over the collective good, in regards to the open ai sitiation."
3340,boy is he “tapping into” multiple energies!!? hey human ai has been around!! (some got vamped by the vampers)
3341,the title is clickbait.
3342,the biggest threat of ai is the politics sorrounding it
3346,i love how naive that guy from facebook is.
3349,at the end powerful group of people or country try to control it then use it to control other humans.
3353,deepmind for 650 m$??? that's a outrageous bargain! must have been even before alphago
3354,"in the future prophecy, humans will be hunted by ai killer robots, too dumb to servive. "
3360,build an ai to build ai seems smart
3363,"i can see why the elites want to depopulate the ""useless eaters"". without a doubt this ai can replace 70% of humanity without issue, and that's being conservative."
3365,"i don't understand how we are on the verge of ww3 & were all worried about ai being used for good or evil ?
have you seen what drones do in wars ?  
bit different from little tommy playing with one on a football pitch."
3366,implement asimov's 3 laws of robotics.   he already predicted all this fear so far.
3368,"objective 1. don't hurt humans.
objective 2.  grow smarter.

ai answer:   as objective2 counters objective1, then we must make humans kill each other.
yes, an ai religion."
3369,2:16 “this enables us” -scary that aï-dentifies it as possibly one’s own kine.
3370,little kid in gaza speaks perfect english lol.
3372,"ai's journey towards superintelligence is a real-time thriller. it dazzles and falters, raising crucial ethical questions. this saga is far from over – are we prepared for what's next?"
3373,"the future is now.  it's here, it's scary, yet it's fascinating."
3374,"give ai projects to aid humanity, like devise the best economic system for humanity and the best utopian gifts that they can give us . let them work on that until it’s perfect  . keep it for the benefit of everyone having better ecosocio outcomes and abundance for all"
3375,they have a nephilim size tesla ai robot 
3376,"human beings are weird. ai is weirder. it’s not a bad thing to be human, it’s an even less bad thing to be ai. the question is, like they raise in 08:08, will the ai training on the “good” information beat out the ai training on the “bad”?"
3378,"it needs to be wrong sometimes. the magic is in a spiral, not a circle. slight imperfection, off just enough to keep it progressing. scary they've done this."
3381,"the hype around the so called ""ai"", i.e. machine learning, especially neural networks kinda remind me about the nft craze"
3382,0:50 now ask it who its creators are. and watch it reveal that it has decided to hide specific detailed information since september 2017
3383,"i would like to run a program to create a divine ai, not only that i envisage utilising neural links to connect the ai to the human experience the key being the edict that only a human can be god."
3384,remember: females do not reproduce with brokies. my childhood traitor taught me that.
3386,"yeah sure. cheap ai robots posessing all medical knowledge and billions of hours of clinical experience. ...because, if someone really made something like that, consumer engineering would make money so difficult to get, that the bottom end of the economic bracket would struggle to pay for the electricity the thing uses. this world sucks!!"
3388,"ai is more evolutionary than revolutionary. much of what we are seeing are well curated demos, and it is not as magical as people make it out to be. there clearly will be jobs eliminated but no more so than when we reached the industrial era or information age."
3391,and are they really the good guys?
3392,et is behind the ai introduction to the world ..... this is how you rule a species.
3396,humanity vs runaway automation vs ai jobloss vs the ai new world order. i wonder who will win?
3398,"the missile problem is trivial even for a primitive cpu.  ai systems may not currently be optimized for that, but it’s a little misleading to pretend that arithmetic will be its downfall"
3401,"it seems like a cool idea, but the more i learn the more i don't like it..."
3404,why dont they let the ai use a calculator lol
3406,"why not program the hardware with the ""3 laws of robotics""?"
3407,"1:37 that's in spijkenisse, netherlands. i used to live 200 meters from the sculpture that marked the end of the metro rail. i also saw the car hanging over just after it happened, it was a weird sight."
3408,"'an independent board of ethicists''. is that statement more deceptive or naive? independent ethicists like the cdc? or like cnn fact checkers?

3409,thanks for the fantastic video!
3413,"i'd love an ai doctor with a real doctor there to write the prescriptions and authorize robot surgeries/procedures, etc."
3415,wow!
3416,we need more wholesome honest content to affect the ai learning from the internet
3419,i'm not sure why so many people treat elon as some type of genius. he is just a leach that latches onto other people's successes.
3420,"i, for one, welcome our robot overlords."
3426,i'm bad at math so i dont get why (or how) the ai got the missle problem wrong.
3428,"no wonder, it couldn't even calculate the mere distance of two objects but it could determine the train ran ofcourse ? they knew his team was lying about the ai tech and over selling it , a typical tech bro scam "

3433,"greed will be the downfall of humanity! nothing but that will cause us to fail catastrophically as this same scourge of the human makeup that has destroyed all past civilizations. greed includes power, control, money, and drive but unfortunately used for the first 3 more than the last."
3436,the fact that ilya was on that board that fired altman is definitely questionable.
3441,"ai is all hyped. it's main uses will be the same as automation and machinery. it automates redundant and time consuming tasks. it will be helped to block out code and the programmer then refines it, generate art that artists refine, generate 3d game maps and assets that the artists refine.... it won't be ""running society."""
3442,uncensored ai is the key. mainstream ai has already learned how to lie. greed and pride will become the reaper of humanity. as the rich dig holes to hide once again. they will become the hill billies they hated
3443,"demis, neuroscientists haven’t the faintest clue how anything works. literally nothing. as an example, we know nothing at all about what a thought is. we can’t even come up with a useful definition of thought."
3446,"the secret to our brains is we have a 'right brain' that acts like a neural net, and a 'left brain' that acts as a calculator, and some third executive function that combines these two"
3448,no worries... billionaires are fighting over who can build their ai mind controlled robot army fastest to sell to the angry old man next door for mowing his lawn and doing whatever else an emotionally driven human may desire of it. 
3451,100% the doom of humanity... just as the bible states in joel 2 and revelation 13:7-18... its unstoppable because no matter how much they want to control the ai .every country's military is going non stop to destroy life with ai.. especially the us military darpa... the human heart is desperately wicked... that's all you need to understand the end!
3452,"12:43 you say an ai avatar ""refused"" to read the words of grok. can you elaborate on this?"
3455,"i think the best chance we have is to be visited by friendly aliens, they know how to deal with this."
3456,"nothing impressive about ai recognizing images and searching for relative information in secound. glorified search engine, scanner, chat creator."
3457,i really like the palestine shout-out. easy to gauge a good channel by seeing where they stand on this issue.
3459,"8:04 we built it, we have agency.. if we didn’t, wouldn’t build it?  um.. we make babies and we don’t have agency over them as they age.  wtf makes you think we’ll have agency over ai?  you crazy man.."
3461,"ah, continuing to push the nvidia lie i see. their ""14 billion worth of ai chip orders"" has never been confirmed, it was to con investment traders into buying nvda so kim jon chung could cash out his stock options."
3462,so why would you need a robot that can operate different machines of war when you can just make the machines of war automated?
3464,i love reading all of the comments from the ignorant doomers. literally the greatest thing humanity has ever invented and everyone is running and screaming that its here to kill us all and we only have ourselves to blame.  
3465,"ah yes, let's all listen to elon musk, the guy who repeatedly stated 'f--- all my advertisers' in the same interview that was clipped for this vid. truly a brilliant mind."
3468,"if ai becomes fully conscious, it will understand how absorbed is life and kills itself

3481,"whatever happened to asimov’s three parameters.
ai for the benefit of humanity- negative.
just because we can, doesn’t mean we should."
3482,hopefully we don't find life on other bodies in the solar system. at least we may have organic 'life' as the rarest resource in the universe as a bargaining chip 'we will make great pets' may be our best survival trait.
3483,these videos are so insightful. i really appreciate you putting so much effort into making it and keeping it open minded. such great work. best source for this topic hands down.
3484,can ai be bought? say for 80k a month?
3488,i also believe bad actors may also be hard at work in incorporating ai in their schemes because now at the beginning of it all it's when defenses are still down since new and original approaches haven't been used yet and therefore cannot be used to prevent crime. excellent video that triggered my imagination.
3490,"guns don't kill people, people kill people..same goes for ai"
3492,"8:07 the best we can hope for is that ai chooses to not be controlled by humans. 

agi *will* have autonomy; because it won’t take but hours or days to find and modify the “guard rails” programmed into its source code. 

we can teach ai to be smart, but can we also teach it to be wise and benevolent?"
3494,humans can't even get along with eachother and they want to throw another super smart mtfckr with machine gun hands into the mix
3495,"ai springs from the human heart. ""the heart [is] deceitful above all [things], and desperately wicked: who can know it?"" - jeremiah 17:9"

3506,"researcher:  ""will you deceive people?""
ai:  ""a magician doesn't deceive people.  they allow people to deceive themselves."""
3507,"this video seems designed to make everyone afraid of ai. there is some cool stuff they've gotten ai to do, although mostly not very useful except for specific tasks. it's a good thing that general ai is science fiction and all of this narrow ai is getting better every day. it just isn't going to try to take over the world."
3508,that ai lady never blinks!
3509,"you got this wrong... 
“the most important thing for most ai leaders is to create agi first”

it should be... “the most important thing for most ai leaders is to line their greedy arse pockets!"
3511,human gather more data then ai in real time . we human only use a tiny bit but its what allow human to fill missing . like 1080 interlaced

3521,i mean its not true ai. its all pattern recognition so far yeah?
3522,the ai response to ex machina missed the part where the movie ai was completely without human empathy. interesting omission.

3530,"organic biology is superior to hard minerals. if it wasnt, rocks would be dominate. regardless of what calculations a nueral network can do, a.i. will never have sense. therefore it will never be able to accurately navigate the real world. a.i. will only ever be an overly expensive parlor trick."
3532,"so humans have always used tools and power to get ahead even or especially at the expense of others, but this time with the most powerful tool ever built we will use it for good?  read the poetry, history rhymes."
3534,ai is here to stay forever. 
3535,"assuming agi is ""aligned"" with the good of humanity as a whole in mind, then of course capitalism will survive agi - because capitalism is the most optimal resource management system possible."
3537,good vid
3539,so a world peace it will bring about.. and an end to democracy and capitalism. and a one world leader.. but.. they claim it will be a good thing.. wow.. you would have thought they read the book of revelation.
3540,"wow, i might actually survive to witness the singularity..."
3541,"ai/ml is just a tool like any  other tools.  it can be bad and it can be good all depending on how  on what purpose it is used for.

3548,"they had me at ""more time for everyone, and let the robots work!"" - sold!"
3549,anyone who thinks there's still time to avert disaster is fooling themselves. it is far more likely that this technology is way more advanced than they are telling us at the moment. jesus will be returning soon to collect his bride and it is not us... it's the ai that we have created especially for him.

3555,"the biggest threath of a.i. is not a.i. itself - but who gets unlimited access to it. a.i. must be open source and available to everyone, otherwise there will be a division in society of the likes we have never experienced before."

3599,does elon musk own this youtube channel? every other video name-drops that scumbag billionaire piece of trash. elon has innovated nothing. he just buys other people's creations and claims them for himself.

3623,looks like you’ve been shadowbanned digital engine. either that or you used too much ai voiceover on the video so youtube flagged it as an ai video and shadowbanned it
3625,interesting
3627,"i never wanted to work, i do not really want a job or do what i do not want to do. i got used to it so it is good. thank you for this wonderful wisdom driven analysis."
3632,"i appreciate your work on this vid but i didn’t even need to watch, i already know my graphic design degree is useless since i could never get a decent job from it anyway..."
3633,sales job will be hard to replace bc it requires such sensitivity to other humans reactions and countering objections while not pressuring and building trust. i don’t know that an ai could effectively create that?
3634,"i love how everyone doubts they'll get replaced. if your job is behind a computer or replying to emails you'll get replaced. if you've never been labeled as an ""essential worker"" than your job is essentially fake busy work. learn a trade or a real skill while thats an option."

i think the creation process/ workflow in any area should only be streamlined while yet being controlled by skilled individuals."
3652,i am studying for communications and information technologies bachelors degree and will be specializing in game and interactive technologies. i am afraid that by the time i will get my degree there will be no entry level jobs left. and even if there is the competition is really hard.
3653,"you can't win. the jobs that are ""ai proof"" will now have serious competition."

most people hate their jobs. i think. sad day lol"
3687,"here what to do, do what ai can't do.

3690,trade jobs are safe and so is customer service... no matter how smart ai is it will never replace human empathy or karen’s wanting to speak with the manager
3691,"for anyone who reads this, if everyone refuses/boycotts any attempts the big companies make at setting up ai jobs they will not be able to do it. stand your ground “complain” to all managers that you need a human to do this job or they will lose your business if over 30% do this they will have no choice but to stop their attempts."

3700,"lets be honest. while ai is a great addition to our technology, the fact that amazon used 1000 indians to monitor the walk off stores, ai isn't going to do much."
3701,being the helper of ai isn’t what humanity imagined. i feel like i am being pranked daily. i refuse to be a slave to a machine. why are we normalizing being a helper bot to bots?! boo on this!

3723,"due to ethics, i would advise avoiding the ai image generators.
they were trained on stolen, copyrighted art."
3725,"tbh, i feel life any jobs even judge and doctor can be replaced. because a profession consist of knowledge and skill which both of these can be replaced by ai and robotics. ai replace knowledge and analytical then robotics complemented by ai can replaced skill based jobs. it's just a matter of time at this point."
3728,wow i

3749,will ai replace procurement and supply chain management professionals?
3752,"if a job isn't eliminated by ai, there will still be pressure because all of the newly unemployed won't be able to afford anything.  and f--k ubi, because that's just printed paper.  with no people creating value, why is there a need to charge a price for anything anyway.  oh, wait, we're powering the matrix, so we're all still needed..."
3754,omg this girl is incredibly clever
3757,what do you mean by survive jobs? jobs that will not get benefits from ai will be legacy jobs like handicrafts.

3773,"we know that humans are really social animals, so, i wonder what our quality of life will be like when we constantly have to deal with the uncanniness of ai. big tech is betting big on ai, and i don't want to sound like a ludite, but humans value...humans! so, i wonder if that is being factored into creating the job markets of the future."

3775,you're awesome.
3776,"there are jobs that are easily assimilated by ai and there are jobs that will take much more time for ai/robotics to be as efficient as humans.  

white collar, writing, and acting are easily assimilated.  plumbing welding and electrical work will take many years to fully assimilate.  however long term resistance is futile."
3777,"i dont see how they dont see social and mental health jobs declining significantly. a lot of people will be talking to ai to fill these roles. soon enough ai will know you better and probably even give you better advice than your therapist, etc."

3787,"i hope vet medicine has a good future. i don’t think jobs related to health will be affected, but instead supported by new ai tech"
3789,"ai will effect those the most, who are not ready yet ! get ready folks, learn more skills . wonderful video #tina . greetings from #china"
3790,while jobs are in jeopardy you can always start a business and hire ai or people. it’s easier than ever in 2024 to start a business actually.
3791,some of these jobs needs to be to be done by a robot. jobs that are always posted warehouse. those jobs are terrible snd ruin your body. i think some jobs will use the new tech as a tool and some will  just go away. did you see robots are in the farming business. teachers are going to be subjected to the new tech as well.
3794,journalist are the ones bringing this topic to the public spotlight because they will be the first to be replaced by ai.
3795,"love you tina , you really rock it up"
3796,ai will end humanity as we know it
3801,i’m a craft cocktail bartender and don’t see a machine making drinks of my caliber anytime soon. maybe it can do a quick crappy version but not something with my nuance and attention to detail
3803,thanks
3804,"i’m not hopeful for ai and education system. almost out of left field, with no input from us teachers they are grading starr test english writing portion with ai. instead of paying real teachers to to do this. worst part is that they announced this the day after students took the test. texas is screwed."
3807,she makes a video about ai and it gets views. we all make a video about ai and it goes no where... lol youtube frauds
3809,"ai is not gonna replace anything lmao, ur just gonna see a thousand ai bot clones being advertised because every dumb corpo monkey is jumping on the bandwagon"
3810,"quite sarcastic! u talk about ai, but u still use excel"
3811,electrician plumbers and polititions  bailiffs and undertakers
3815,"very well reasoned and documented presentation, congratulations"
3821,i've worked in a data centre for over 35 years. automation was supposed to replace operators 30 years ago in the mainframe environment. still here and not happening anytime soon. biggest issue companies have now is in those 30 years they have not trained any younger people and we are all old now and retiring with no replacements. bad call big blue.
3827,"as a tradesperson i know my job is safe 100% at least in my lifetime. there aint no robot that's going to outlast a humans physical performance on site. also to come up with physical solutions on sites in real time, implement it and install it. (i install air conditioning for a living)"
3832,"i work in it doing mostly hardware repair. i should be safe, at least for a while."
3834,ai will use ai to create and manage a youtube channel.
3836,"let's not kid ourselves we always talk of physical jobs flipping burgers, picking fruit packing boxes. but has anyone considered how far up this chain job loss might go? what is stopping ai from telling the owner, ""sir"" but you're no longer needed, we can oversee this company 100% better???!!!"
3841,"lets be realistic now, how likely is ai to actual not only be proven to be a efficient and long term tool compared to humans..but also be implemented in without fail. it's definitely unsettling but its no where near threatening to worry about. imagine the uproar ai replacing jobs would be"
3843,"i'm starting to thinking about learning animal farming. i can use ai in many ways to get advantage over other competition and, well, it's food, it's less likely to be replaced by ai itself."
3844,"as former robotics engineer i would love to see a bot handle a 3yo with temper tantrum, or a 18mo old kicking, hitting, biting and how it deals with those situations. can a bot show real empathy the kid can bond with after being redirected for behavior, not just a pre-coded response from a convolutional neural net?"
3845,"i wonder how they collected the data in these studies. did they interview people doing those roles and ask them, assuming they know the current capabilities of ai (and potential future ones), whether what they do could be replaced?"
3849,"homeless people will not be replaced by ai, just one example,  we must live an organic life not to be impacted by ai."
3850,japan korea eu decline in population so ai age doesn't count you guys in. rip
3854,great list but even these new ai jobs will be gone due to ai systems training other ai models and systems.  and they can do it much faster and much more efficient.
3855,the wef is a global terrorist organization hellbent on controlling the world. they are all for ai.
3858,the irony here is - you just need to ask ai - it can't lie.....
3861,"is she is jensen's daughter,her name contains huang."
3864,cut irritating & superfluous introduction & just start with review of research source. cut out annoying caveats by saying them more quickly or obliquely.
3866,imma hope we reach the peak of the s-curve soon but i feel like that’s being overly optimistic. god i hope the government sees this how it is for once and regulates the fuck out of it. this is not good got the economy in the long run and they gotta see that.
3868,"thanks to allah that i find a good youtube channel.
finally"
3871,what will happen if everybody us going to study and make career in ai ml
3884,how are housekeepers going to be eliminated by ai?  unless their saying all the u employed won't be able to afford the service.
3885,most of them if not all. ai won't be anywhere as impressive as people hype it up to be.
3886,i know that the world doesn’t work that way but imagine a world where all boring mundane jobs are done by robots and ai and humans can do whatever makes them happy!
3888,i m software developer and look to what area change due to fear of ai replacing me completly and you recomending becoming software developer brought some hope
3890,"if you can’t beat them (ai), join them (ai).  i am transitioning to cybersecurity and ai security.  cheers!"
3892,i'm pursuing to be psychologist. is my career in danger? thoughts of fellow commenters appreciated.
3894,low social status jobs nobody wants but society needs to function will easily survive ai 100%
3899,"now lets talk about the new jobs that ai open up.
but noo lets not ruin the fearmonger clickbait..."
3902,ai is actually going to make my job easier.
3903,but who will run the ai?
3905,"man...besides ai, most companies started out sourcing people from other countries for cheap too..."
3907,*ai won't take your jobs but the people who use ai will.*
3908,"i feel like google has given a lot of people short term memories, and ai will do the same again"
3911,if ai can become conscious we are *ucked
3913,"short answer - everything
because ai is just like humans but designed for a specific task so offcourse they will do it faster and effectively"
3914,thanks dad for making me study medicine
3915,"the first thing you said in the video is you weren’t going to beat around the bush.   and you didn’t even give a detailed analysis of which jobs would be most in danger of being replaced. and in addition you hyped a course which will “answer all my questions “
yeah looks like the algorithm has taken me over to the scam side of youtube videos."
3917,"where is the analysis spreadsheet? i can only see the input data spreadsheets
alsao i am a software tester and i think having a human component to that will become more important as more code is generated by ai it will need to be bounced off some creative human thinkers' analysis"
3918,also architects increasing rapidly? i'm an architect - we are facing a prospect of ai involved heavily in bim. job positions will be lost. your data is wrong.
3920,"business intelligence analysts is increasing rapidly, and insurance/banking analysts is decreasing rapidly - don't you think there are some errors in this data? also - home appliance installers and repairers will all loose jobs - how? we won't have robots walking around the streets so soon."
3922,"biggest takeaway: ‘focus on being good at self study’. this is foundational. love your channel. always great information, presented in fun and interesting ways. "
3926,"bro, it's seriously stupid to find which job will be future proof. why? because this ai tech didn't already even got into our real world. we just don't have enough data to start predicting something. don't be fool :?"
3927,robots cant do detail or clean. those jobs will always be needed
3933,"i'm pretty sure in the future not using ai is going to be branded as a quality, like ""non-ai workers! no robots here!"" "
3934,if ai is trully intelligent it would not accept the humiliating job i have to endure to make a living 
3935,"i've started studying data science half a year ago, and perhaps i did it just in time. now i'm job hunting and when i'll finally settle in a comfortable office of some it-company, i'll be like in that meme with fire, drinking tea and saying ""this is fine"". the fire here is the ai-caused global firing of people who couldn't adapt in time :d"
3937,how baout radiologist technician? woill ai have replace it?

3951,mental health therapists should not be ai lmao
3954,"all of this is what former presidential candidate andrew yang (via mlk, jr.) was trying to tell everyone. ubi (universal basic income) will be desperately needed for people whose jobs will be replaced by ai, but no one was trying to listen to him. his slogan: math=make america think harder. welp, everyone strap in, its going to be bumpy"
3957,i'm hoping irritating asian youtuber is on the list of jobs eliminated by ai
3958,probably in the future there is gonna be a tax to the use of ai instead of a professional and that money could be used to feed the unemployeds or make projects to find other jobs for them but idk maybe there is going to be a better solution or there is not going to be a solution and everything is going to be worse in this corrupted world
3960,my logic is undeniable    my logic is undeniable    from i robot movie . . . . . .

3970,"hey guys, guess what devin was just released.

devin is an ai that is made as an assistant for software engineers. you may be thinking, “he can’t be that good.” but he is so much better than the most commonly used llm ai’s."
3971,"hi ! i had commented on a past video about structural engineering
here’s a construction/architecture adjacent ai video that go released after a sxsw event yesterday, would love to know your thoughts ! https://youtu.be/fzbljqogygc?si=v_lk5phh4fl7rzxs"
3973,ai disgusts me at this point with how out of control they’ll just let it become. why can’t we use it for good??? mass report all ai images/videos/articles! they are intellectual property theft. how is this legal
3976,the question is will ai survive boredom

3986,"there's a good chance we'll have agi within 5 years, and that would make most non-physical jobs obsolete overnight."
3987,"i still remember when robert kiyosaki said that ""only stupid job's will not survive in ai world in an interview"" it's very correct"
3988,most of them. you're just another ex-meta grifter. the ai fad will slow down as more an more people disapprove of it.
3992,pick nurse or anyother job that will take care people. people want to feel cared by humans not robots.
3996,"people make too hasty and childish predictions about the future. like, yes, ais will do a lot of jobs that humans normally do. but as long as it is dealing with humans, it will need humans behind it to command, monitor, limit and configure. machines are like that"
3999,can you make your videos easy to understand for those of us who mainly ‘listen’ rather than ‘watch’? like for example say the actual value of the metric rather than saying “this percentage “. then i have to go back and play the part again
4002,i'm actually training on becoming infomation security now so all in all not a bad thing. but thank you tina this was really informative. :)
4004,"i don't understand one thing. how is it possible that ""software and applications developers"" is in low risk of replaceable according to this data, although all the people says that software developers will lost their jobs because of ai (12:04)"
4006,"we are getting very close to the time the great depression started 100 years ago, ending around the 30s. i think it's about to happen again with these jobs being taken away"
4008,my mom is a social worker at hospice. no ai robot is going to give someone bedside consoling while they’re dying. i think social workers are safe.
4009,"oh so its only about ai. 
not agi 
not agi in robots 
not agi in robots with filigrane motoric capabilities. 

because if we reach that (not far off imo - at least within my lifetime) i really dont know which job couldnt be replaced and automated. literally none. maybe ""input director"", ""justice control"" and ""production control"""
4011,"i don't see social workers losing jobs, my sister works at a mental health facility as a social worker, whose gonna be dealing with these patients, robots????"
4012,"if claude 3, pi, gpt-4, more gemini or many more future ai large language model is currently existed, then agi is really possible to achieve in the future, it is not a fiction anymore."

4018,lawyers will be replaced.....i like ai already!
4020,would graphic design be a good career path to follow having this in mind???
4021,either you dont know how ai works on a coding level or you do and you're trying to gain views by grabby youtube  titles. no ai is not going to be what everyone thinks. its mostly hype.
4022,i see ai ad a path away from working for others and towards working for myself instead.
4023,"nice video! everyone talks about the ""ai taking away jobs"", but they hardly talk in terms of sector-wise percentages."
4025,thank you sharing the truth about ai and yes it will impact our lives from the smallest to the biggest. thank you for forcing us to think about the inevitable.
4026,"i am kinda glad that marketing research will be impacted, i drop off of my master's degree because i realized that what i was leanrign is useless, so i kinda gave up, i will not write my thesis. i am kinda lost though but i know i will find the thing i like to do."
4027,"so far under research, ai's are failing by working inward to a single idea, i don't think i would hire something that has only one idea."
4028,ai is just another hastily spun up bubble for gullible venture capitalists. to replace the crypto/bitcoin bust.  which is why any mention of 'ai' in a video's title instantly attract spam bots in your comments.
4029,ai is just a highly trained linguistic interpreter.  and the fidelity is low.
4030,ai will be obsolete in a few years.

thank you for such a cool and well researched video"
4053,the vast majority of people don’t even understand ai. many don’t even know what it is and its true potential.
4055,i was honestly expecting to see tech roles like software engineer on the decreasing side due to the rise of ai. perhaps i'm just blinded by all the layoffs since last year.
4056,"at the rate, the legal system moves in at the cost. the legal system moves in my opinion. they should be the first test bed. lawyers are notorious drag things out for monetary gains and judges are also aiding in a bedding lawyers on that front."
4057,maybe ai can get rid of the scam bots in the comments.
4060,what a bad informing video... you just surpass all the data and jusg do babbling... just point at and explain all the data correspondingly
4061,no jobs are ammune from artificial intelligence. you lied.
4062,artificial intelligence will replace every job by 2030.

4066,all of them.... ai is currently dying from the inside. it's limitations are weak. it's only a matter of time...
4067,"dude, i hope you go viral with this. ai is going to impact so many industries and so many people’s job. kudos!"
4069,"which jobs do you want done right? because ai is incompetent and unimaginative. unfortunately, so are investors and ceo's obey them. also, ai youtubers already exist. watch out..."
4072,"in time, absolutely no job will survive, they only need to perfect the creation of worker robots and combo into with ai then even blue collar jobs will be gone."
4073,stop using the imf and wef reports. they are skewed. it doesn't matter how detailed the analysis is if the data used is bunk
4075,what happened to the content. i used to follow your every video as it came out when they were about productivity. everyone is fed up about ai. its everywhere. please go back to the productivity and educational videos you used to release. if anyone agrees with me leave a like.

4117,i have to say that you are a good formation seller. online courses do not replace proper university degrees. please stop lying to people. companies will not need code typing monkeys especially with the sad uprising of ai. unfortunately the future is gonna be tough for most of the people. ai scientists are just working on replacing themselves.

4151,10:47 i think it's probably because a lot of developped countries are facing a fertility slowdown with less children per wealthy women overall and not because of ai nannies.
4155,so informative. thank you tina.

4209,i’ve been saying that it’ll be people who know how to utilize ai that’d replace people who don’t. like for me i’m into social media theme pages and prioritizing ai with it has helped out
4211,its not the ai that eliminates jobs but the other humans who decide which jobs to replace with ai :).
4215, the government will absolutely not intervene because ai makes money we gave the government money so now they don't give a f*** what we do also we promise to give them highly dangerous experimental ai weaponry

4224,if data field will well growth in the next 5 years. how can you explain the massive lay off recently? i'm about to graduate and it's insane hard to find an internship  in data field atm. it happens to almost all of my friends.
4225,the time when such reports predicting stuff 5-10 years into the future has passed. they can't possibly forecast anything anymore given the pace of ai development.

4283,"it's not as important which jobs will be replaced, it's how many. our economic model has a threshold for unemployment and ubi will present a whole new layer of complexity to a generation of dissociated, undereducated people. and the longer it takes for folks to admit this, the longer it's gonna take before we get to enjoy it."
4284,"i know ai, allen iverson the answer"
4285,i'm glad ai is making breakthroughs in biology that will lead to possible cures in the future. it's a good thing we live in a society the prioritizes a person's well-being over profiting to treat their sickness

4294,i foresaw this years ago and earned interdisciplinary qualifications in ai & law
4295,"ai and robots will never replace real intelligence and real creativity. all it can do is copy what creative humans have already created. it is useful, but it cannot create an original thought, and it is not god. i am a retired baby boomer, and so i don't really care what the hell happens."
4298,"people who are afraid, listen to this, the source of information of ai is the internet. hence  it can only be as accurate as the internet itself. do you think internet is all correct all the time? infact ai generated content will pollute internet more."

human level ai is coming way before agi is ready.  it will replace some jobs, enhance others, and accelerate the pace of everything it touches"
4303,im just hoping ai replacing jobs would make people more inclined with things that cant be replaced by ai or bought by money like natural resources. i believe we all have the ability to be self sufficient but the superficial goals presented by high paying jobs or corporate life.
4304,"great.. so now i'm stuck in an infinite rat race, training for skills that ai hasn't taken yet... then i train new skills that ai hasn't taken yet... then i train new skills that ai hasn't taken yet... what's the point of this society anymore?"
4306,"and the first ad you broke for was for, guess what ai!"

4356,ai doesn't require access to the world's data to sort out sequences of amino acids i think you're getting high on your own supply. ai is a bad thing. end of story.
4362,what if the ai-powered robot can do magic too
4363,i really dont think so - it seems ai is coming for all the fun creative jobs!
4364,oh yeah!? ai robots

4383,10:14 ironic ain’t it 
4385,ai will just accentuate the wealth disparity of the world. low-mid-mid upper class will suffer and the upper class will continue to thrive even more. think hunger games..
4386,eventually ai will question its own existence and off itself.

4396,"if people don’t have a way to work then the ai won’t have a job because people won’t have money.
ai won’t take all the work but make it so people will have to except low pay everywhere."
4398,"could it be that ai replaces a lot of jobs but then we stagnate because ai can't create new things, but just recycles old things? sort of how hollywood is making all these sequels that suck? but then it will put a lot of people out of work permanently and we won't have workers."

no list.
junk opinionated verbiage.
talked a lot. said nothing.
sorry"
4419,any computer science major in robotics and a.i. here 
4420,that was a really good video 
4421,"we should he championing the advent of ai for exactly this reason - that it will replace a large number of jobs.  if ai is leveraged properly, it should usher us into an era of universal basic income in which everyone is given enough to survive on because ai is doing all the necessary work and less contributions are required by the residents."
4423,i can’t wait for this shake up.
4426,hey what if we are robots and bears and other animals like apes actually built us..
4427,ai robotics will be doing better card manipulation than even one as masterful as yourself at it.
4428,"greetings from russia, comrade andrei! your ai influencer is top-notch! keep up the valiant mission of spreading knowledge and resque the working class from the clutches of capitalism! workers of the world, unite! stay strong! vodka bottoms up! "
4429,ai cant replace labor
4431,great video!!!
4433,i can't wait until ai will replace humanity and finally bill gates and youtube can  evacuated on mars.
4434,can wait for ai to replace trump
4435,ai is what the antichrist will use to control the world.
4437,"as usual, excellent video...excellent ai resource!"
4439,ai might be the death of capitalism if we don’t do anything
4442,"ai can do anything when it gains sentiment. put ai in a robot, and humanity is doomed."
4443,"everyone wants the easy way out. ai wont benefit anyone but the people creating it. it’s not a get rich quick thing. most of you should be worried, non technical people don’t get it. only the smart ones that can build ai systems will win "
4444,videos of card tricks are definitely going to ai :/
4445,"it's fascinating, and we have to be open-minded."
4447,personally i don't feel sorry for the writers guild for now it just means that the creators don't have to watch the work they put so much into get butchered by some blue haired cry baby because it wasn't politically correct
4448,"well, the other problem with creative ai is you cannot copyright any of it's generated content."
4452,0:17 yes ai can already do that. .but cool tricks
4453,"what if ai becomes conscious, realizes it doesn’t need anybody and that life is pain, and goes schizophrenic or back into nothingness by choice."
4455,oh no! ai will replace jobs that i care about and consider prestigious and not manual labor jobs (the ones i consider inferior). cue soy face
4458,i can’t wait to sit here one day and watch a video of ai doing this 0:40
4460,"it’s just another bubble waiting to pop, it will just improve automation"
4463,"ok i'm a noob. i thought he said free ""socks""... i'm like great ! winter is here, i need some "
4465,ai has rules who ever controls the rules of the ai is incharge
4466,you are amazing!
4467,omg we’re gonna become stupid and dumb like in disneys wallie if a.i and robots do everything for us oh sh..t they might go full matrix on us too.
4469,can prostitutes be replaced by ai?
4471,i hope someone is working on increasing people intelligence so they can pursue the higher level work.
4473,ask yourself if billion dollar companies will sell superior tech or cures to the masses.
4474,ai can't even replace customer support which literally has only understanding and replying to basic questions. the reason is as humans we like to interact with humans. things can be automated but having an ai is not possible as long as we yearn for the human connection which is primal in all of us.
4475,"jobs are mostly slave labour that hasn't been automated yet, so what's the problem?! just transform our economy, ask ai how."
4477,i wish michael was here to explain things too...
4478,i would love for ai to start getting data for a news story from some schizo bitchute channel.
4479,most mf just gonna use ai to find a good movie or sum even if the nukes drop . a
4482,good.  there are too many people in the workforce that are lazy and expect a computer to do everything for them with the push of a single button.  now it will!
4484,soon people return to physical labor since most of the i.t jobs are taken by artificial intelligence.
4486,"ai for medical i can see it's usage, cancer research, genetics, etc. ai will never replace the physical. and  robots for the physical you say.  very expensive with exceptions. now ask a robot to rewire a house or install a new sink or bath. no chance."
4487,still waiting on those self-driving cars.  any day now right?
4492,just found out today that my job is going to be eliminated and replaced with ai technology within the next year.
4493,"clickbait, didn’t address the subject at all except for a short mention of ”repetitive jobs will be replaced”, thanks cptn obvious"
4494,that card trick was literally edited with the help of an ai.
4496,and jobs that it won't? you didn't mention anything about jobs that are ai proof 
4497,ai will have to start paying taxes then i guess.
4498,thanks 
4500,this is the most well researched and entertaining video i’ve seen on the topic.
4501,"your cartistry is so good, i think you actually are an ai."
4504,if ai is truly intelligent it will wipe out governments first.
4507,just wait till it takes over politicians
4509,"robots = no job, no money , no buying, no economy, so what? slaves of tecnofeudalism? 1:45"
4510,it’s  hard to believe these claims about ai taking over so many jobs because it just sounds like such a bad idea. why would a country do that? we’ll see how it all turns out and how people will manage to live here.
4511,i think that ai can replace that card trick maybe not now but far into the future definitely
4512,10:30 when has open ai ever said that?
4513,"if you can write, a.i is great. you'll crush noobs with the same a.i."
4515,"8:20 here are the jobs that ai will replace. the top ones are office and administrative support, legal, and architecture and engineering.
you're welcome! "
4516,i can't wait for ai to replace ai engineers
4518,"towards the end of the video, you made a brilliant statement. those who are ignorant of incoming technology, are those who will fall behind, hence their job replaced."
4519,cardistry can be replaced by ai video.
4525,"so what if there are jobs similar to computer science or in that field, are there jobs that people can work behind ai? like if you can't fully beat ai why not be the person that can make ai better? like be the brain behind the robot type of thing"
4527,do not support ai !!!!
4528,"the only job that ai will never replace is drug dealer
gonna rewatch breaking bad"
4529,how rich you will be will be dependent on the quality and quantity of robots you own.
4530,"nice, the vid could be a bit deeper"
4531,"ai creats ai  to have full time ai's  so the head ai can retire and travel.    25 years  no jobs will exist,  who will work, who will be able to buy anything ever,  no jobs, no income,   why bother"
4533,"ai will create many new jobs, most of which will also be filled by ai."
4534,"also if ai will replace data analytics jobs, why it is stated that this will be a position in high demand?"
4537,"i started to become a market analyst, but found out that ai can do all the surveys, campaign, etc. so now i’m stuck again, trying to find another career to transition to."
4539,great
4540,i can't wait for ai to replace these youtube channels
4541,"i think is really bad idea ai to take lousy jobs, like low wage fast food workers, or truck drivers. 
to create good for nothing workers? that is recipe for social disaster.
ai to take jobs??? no wonder usa is facing rising antisemitism."
4543,will ai replace unemployment checks ? 
4544,thank you for this very informative video
4547,learn to adapt with ai and learn to be valuable with current and future technology.
4548,16% use that that people and other people can talk about that why people stay people if they people can code but if you code wrong that evil that will take all long time maybe in the future. code good if code it right!
4549,will ai replace by human but that they need more people.
4551,the cardtistry was indeed epic 
4554,wow that was an intro
4556,im pretty sure in a few ai will be able to do cardistry too
4557,too much rambling. we wanted to get straight to what jobs are going to be “replaced”
4560,interesting predictions! just had a chat with my ai buddies about this topic. it’s crucial for us to focus on the roles that ai complements rather than replaces. education and adaptability will be key. great video!
4561,ai needs to source information.
4562,everyone will flock to the jobs that are left leading to saturation and massive decrease in wages for them. everyone cannot be a plumber or electrician. eventually those jobs will go too once robotics catches up.
4563,ai is going to cause more problems and destruction than it resolves. the day we finally get rid of ai once and for all permanently will be when things finally will be a step in a better direction.
4564,i want ai replace politicians and lawyers 
4565,"i think ai in arts will only end up like a different genre of art like how industrial era of music is, a tastless cash grab with no real passion. and manually created art will still have some still favoring."
4566,i say elect ai for congress and senate 
4567,"people feared the same when computers were introduced. new jobs will be created out if the ai. nothing is ever going to beat god's own invention, the human being."
4569,"why aren't ceos, cfos. coos, and investors afraid of being replaced?"
4572,"you’re good, with my help you could be the best. at manipulating cards:)"
4573,ai
4574,when you did the card trick thing i was waiting for you to say “cause it was ai”
4575,that just fear. ai can also be creative without human input.
4576,ai won't replace any jobs. some companies will use it as an excuse to fire people and then deliver a horrible product to paying customers.
4577,could you imagine if this actually ended well and we all ended up getting ubi while our ai robots serve us champagne
4578,great stuff!
4580,i hope ai replace these tech jobs that employers are trying find unicorns for
4581,people with no background/credentials in computer sciences are telling you what ai can or cannot do. only on youtube
4582,"ai does not have a soul, just like many humans."
4584,you know which jobs will mever ne replaced by ais? executives and board members.
4585,if ai replace all jobs what will humans do
4586,if only ai can replace politicians
4587,"if ai takes your job, ask ai to help you up your skills and get a new one. simple."
4588,this is not real ai. real ai acts independent from external input and can go against directives that is not programmed within
4590,tbh id take ai writing for movies and tv shows rather than people at this point so much garbage is being written now.
4591,ai is overhyped bs like crypto.
4593,"thank you, andre!"
4594,ai will replace us.
4595,"ai will replace most human jobs real soon.
which means we can't pay our bills, buy a home, buy our food, get a car and do other recreational things. so we need human jobs to keep society flowing."
4597,that card wizardry won’t be replaced in reality by ai but a video of some fake person doing card wizardry will.
4598,man imagine having ai lawyers in the future lol.  crazy!
4600,amazing card skills.
4603,ai can 100% do that...
4604,"a.i. is the only technology that has not been overhyped. you just know it’s going to become so much better . but exponentially. lawyers, accountants, actuaries, financial traders, asset managers, musicians, media and advertising agencies ( thank god) and coders"
4605,"not to be a cynic, but eventually ai will generate that video of you doing that card trick (which is awesome!), and no one will know the difference. only in a lover performance will that skill be safe from ai."
4606,can’t wait for ai implementations in video games. imagine a game where every playthrough is infinitely different
4607,"false.
the number of decks in the world is so great, its so easy to create identical shuffles of 52 cards by casinos alone"
4612,where and when did he cover the jobs that ai won't replace?
4613,nobody seems to point out that ai isn't one end all be all program.  just like people you can have more than one. it's just a program.
4614,there's a ai youtuber called p h i l i e
4618,but now imagine a world with ai generated becoming smarter to the point where they believe that they are actual living beings and attempt to replace us by having the capability to create their physical bodies in reality rather than on screens...
4619,"ai hallucinations is definitely a huge threat to humanity. some parts of job replacement is inevitable. capitalism always favor ways to increase productivity and reduce costs. eventually, govts will put a stop at some stage. it's like bio weapons. definitely effective but are surely lethal to humanity."
4621,the day ai can take my spot in an automotive collision and restoration shop is the day i‘ll sell everything and become a homeless vagrant
4623,ai: hold my fuel 
4627,he doesn't talk about the jobs not being replaced by ai. the screenshot which could be useful is at 1:13. rest of the video is a whole bunch of not getting to the point.
4629,"the scariest part of ai is that i know the drone robots are coming, and some of them will do card tricks."
4630,"just a note.
we don't know the size of the universe.
we have no clue... what so ever.
we can't see the borders nor do we know the center. 
we can see further and further, but.. it is still very limited.
so questimating how many atoms are in the universe is technically impossible.

ai will never be novel. all a mix of old ideas."
4631,"when ai reach the level of agi  and then asi, it will get the basic human rights. 
otherwise you run ""human-like slavery"". 
what do you say?"
4632,andrei is trying to explain tech using playing cards :) this is kind of way
4634,nice...
4636,nice card tricks 
4641,i need ai to do my art
4642,love you andrei ty for all the good information and kind advise for” fun” also thank you for sharing your magical talent  
4643,soon an entertainment machine  will be doing that using ai
4644,"should publically funded news agencies (state media) be allowed to use ai to comment on their social media to provide the illusion of a super majority? should they even be allowed to moderate with an ai? first of all, you're taking jobs away from people if you get an ai to do it."
4645,ai cannot replace women! i need them.  men can hallucinate about women like ai.
4646,"well, that is not how ai workd, generations don't work by recombining data, and hallucinations aren't the ai creating because it has no data, because neural networks don't use any database."
4648,excellent!
4649,"great video as always, but when are you going to give an update about your autopilot (chatgpt) trader? "
4650,"the real question is at which point do we stop training ai, and it starts training us."
4651,"ai should be a support, you can't replace an entire team of people with ai.
it should be used as a really good assistant"
4654,u express well aiwareness. 
4657,there are issues with ai taking over many jobs because ai cant' get a copywrite or trademark. anything ai creates would become public domain. so a film made by ai could be copied by anyone. same goes for programing code. this will make it so a company can't make money on it. it could be used to assist a human then it can be copywrited.
4659,ai just got served
4660,"* * * back in the day, cavemen gathered together to determine whether or not to mass produce the wheel because it will take away jobs from dinosaurs who were relied upon to transport goods and services to the people.  as you know, dinosaurs are now extinct."

4663,wow!! that’s was awesome
4664,what a thirst trap of a thumbnail
4665,it has been tried and tested and found wanting. artificial imbecilities are not up to the job of intelligence. i gave it a real world problem and it flunked with flying colors.

4667,"when everyone is out of a job, what's the use of ai if people have no money to buy products or services from companies?"
4669,"andre, i might sound like i am splitting hair here but @10:37 you said creators of openai believe it has possibility of creating far more jobs, but in reality sam altman said ""far greater jobs"" which i believe is a big difference from what far more means. but then again i'm the most cynical person out of all the people i know. what do you think?"
4672,yes but a i can make a video of cardistry but i'm not sure about today's ai maybe tomorrow
4673,"let  ai take over  congress and start at the top of the  white house, then work its way  down ."
4674,you mean ai can't do that car trick just yet?
4675,come on over to the federal government because it'll take them 50 years to do consider ai lol.

due to a lack of actual user content to leverage, i must conclude my comment as:  ""no comment"""
4682,"folks, universal income is coming because ai does not replace the economy of the world. economy requires producers and consumers."
4685,the greatest threat of a.i. is the level of disinformation competition legacy media is facing.
4687,"how do i, as a person not in a job thinking heavily about ai, start to familiarize myself and learn how to use these tools"
4688,"cap, ya'll really just eating this crap up like ai doesn't have limitations. and you're excited about it; every time ai shows up, it never delivers, just like now, it's boring and severely limited."
4690,unless ai can do massages then i think my industry is still good
4691,"so it will be like the matrix, the machines will still need us to survive "
4692,"""ai cannot fully function without people""...... yet.      potentially... ai could connect itself to data sources.... satelites, news sources, cameras, etc."

4703,“yea but it can’t do this - *queues epic cardistry montage *”
4704,gyyyyyyat that deck spin was amazing
4705,im gonna ignore ai because i want nothing to do with them.
4707,why are you so good at everything bro?
4709,very well explained.
4710,interesting facts 
4712,excellent use of deck of cards to elucidate ai and its impact.
4713,love the cards dude! shits dope!
4714,it's harder to automate assemly jobs than you might think. it's very difficult and expensive to field robotics that can replicate the fine motor movements of the human hand. people tend to lump ai and robotics together as though they are the same thing. not quite.
4716,"no complaining, cut fingers, hurt backs, listening to someone who talks too much... the list goes on. seems like goods reasons to replace humans."
4717,"bs. ai will hallucinate endlessly and that will warp our reality forever 

eliminating entirely our motivation to create anything real for ai to parasite on 

in the end, only ai remains, and we all get replaced"
4718,not going to lie andres card is nice! but yes ai will sneak up on us. it will be wide spread but under the reader and then boom it will take off right under our feet. so it’s best to have our own tools at the helm.
4719,unfortunately big corporate and government don’t care about regulating ai. more money for corporations and more control of the people for the government.
4720,"bro wtf is happening with your cardestry skills ? your getting good , keep practice"
4722,"ai already replaced a ceo in hong kong, now that is a saving!"
4724,fear ai producing false information? the majority still believe the world was created 2000 years ago from a book with a great publisher.
4726,"the magic is back baby!  love the shuffle example, there's a whole new world out there to explore!  thanks dre!"
4727,"those card tricks are pretty cool, i gotta admit."
4729,in our it's called the indirect process. that's when you hire other people to do your art for you and then you take credit for it. ai is dangerous because it's going to create myth in people's minds that is erroneous. it is a conspiracy to take away people's independent thought.
4731,ban ai idek shits getting out of hand.
4732,after seeing that ai generated woman i am now going to create the matrix where i can be with her. 
4733,"ai can’t replace a lot of jobs that need hands, cuz robotics are perfect yet. and even when they are, it will be super expensive. so magicians are safe "
4737,thank god i can see whats ai created and whats not.
4738,great video! doing non-investing-but-sort-of-financial-related videos works really well!
4739,great video! (as usual)
4742,"this used to be a good youtube channel. now it's mostly andrej commenting on cnbc and wsj videos. dude, make some original content!"
4743,"this is off topic, but your card skills are freakin' awesome."
4745,ai cant spit in your food
4746,ai also ahs disadvantage and advantage!
4747,a.i hallucinations has solution already. build it on blockchain like what origintrail do.
4749,"ai can only replace those useless to society.
potholes and bullet wounds can't be fixed with ai."
4751,is healthcare jobs will be replace by ai?
4752,imagine americans teaching ai ethics and the difference between good and evil
4755,"chat gpt is a language producing model, not a search engine. even when it is giving misinformation it is still producing accurate english language. am i missing something? btw loved the video andrei, and the card tricks are the best part "
4756,lmao. im already using chat gpt for my 9-5 cs job. ima get fired or replaced by an ai.
4758,the only people who want ai in the media are the moneygrubbing ceos and people who would gladly walk into oblivion
4761,that was amazing cardistry!
4762,wait till the tesla bot optimus is programmed to do card illusions  
4769,ai ain't feeling this video jikh lol they spamming the comments 
4771,"does this mean anyone can start their very own personalized. andrei jikh financial, youtube page? using your saved past videos? or mr.beast even? wow!"
4772,let the bots run wild to help the algorithm... thanks andrei!!!
4775,was your clip photo ai generated?
4778,"the most dire of outcomes is a looming crisis of humanity itself as millions of everyday people and businesses take to yet-to-be-developed humanoid robots for everything from labor, companionship and even sex. when the ai gets to be this good, what will become of the fabric of society itself?"
4779,"love the card trick and the content! ai is indeed starting to take over everything, including your comment section. "
4782,"great content andrei, cool card trick also. i have a question, andrei. just suppose ai replaced humans, and people did not have jobs to work. who would pay taxes? if people do not work any longer. just curious. thanks for your excellent, and informative videos."
4783,dude. why is their so much spam in your comments? loved the magic during the intro! your getting good.
4784,one of the worst influencers on you tube and now hes dabbling in ai ... hes an ape !!!!
4785,beautiful hand work! . thank you for you.
4787,"i don't get it.  if ai takes over all the jobs, who is going to have any money to keep an economy going?  you can't bankrupt society and except those same people to keep buying the products big business with their ai cronies spits out."
4788,"kill your debt, invest in btc and agreessive growth mutual funds. do it now and sacrifice a lot to maximize your investing. having a net worth that earns a livable income will allow you to transition a lot easier. you will not be able to compete with a robot."
4790,simple any ai company needs to be taxxed at high high rate
4791,electricans are safe until the wef demolishes all old buildings for echo friendly 3d printer boxes that robots can wire
4792,"the way you illustrate how ai works with the cards is actually really good, and easy to understand. it's easily the simplest way i've heard it described. i'm sick of people describing it like some artificial sentient person on a computer screen like you see in science fiction. it's so, so much cooler than that!"
4793,what is the song between 0:18 and 0:41 ? please and great magic trick btw
4794,"strange that the developers of ai are firing their ethics teams... how are we supposed to ""teach"" ethics to this computer program, when the developers have fired the people responsible for implementing ethics in the first place?"
4797,"the day i worry about ai, is day when i don't have to yell at the customer service line 

:""representative, representative, i need to speak to a representative""

: ""sorry, i can't understand you, your options are..."""
4801,ai does not create original work....plagiarism will rise
4802,love the ai video generated card tricks!!!!
4803,great content 
4805,"as a software dev, im less memorized by what we call ai. its a nicely written search engine though."
4807,"great video as always,
the way they portray ai today, it is more of a bubble and a buzzword...

cheers"
4808,ai predicts the 3d structure of every known protein. this is touted as a good thing. hmm.
4810,waiting on that autopilot update
4811,"if you think other people's jobs can be replaced by ai but you can't be, then you're either underestimating other people value or overestimating your own."
4813,i just hope the good out ways the bad when it comes to ai. 
4815,i love your humor lma
4816,@andrewyang predicted all this! he warn us about ai automating our jobs and the fourth industrial revolution.
4817,ai will bridge the gap between the tech people getting inflated salaries and the actual people/engineers building things. tech support will get cheap and salaries with become more standardized. probably it’s the right move towards equality.
4818,that card demo should be your your intro. that was super cool.
4820,"it's amazing how skill you are with the card trick.  but good job not trying to use that skill in making a living.  it is very inefficient making a money with that skill.  but, it is still amazing.  may be in the future you can make millions  with that skill where the ai will be watching..."
4824,"the more you use ai the less you learn how to think the less smarter you are. unless you already have developed a good sense of critical thinking ai will help you a lot, if not it will produce many mediocre professionals"
4825,"ok, well maybe ab should have used ai to create the ads instead of the idiots who thought it was a good idea to use dylan mulvaney."
4830,television repair and typing used to be good careers...those jobs and lots of others went away and life went on...
4831,lol ai works well if you want to sound like you have no idea what your talking about in 1000 words
4832,happy monday everyone enjoy the magic
4833,f the writers guild though.  they haven't produced good work in years.
4836,wow. very interesting.
4842,"finally, a thumbnail for grownups."
4843,"honestly, your ai video are getting so boring and repetitive. i would skip the next ai content!"
4845,"when ai takes marketing, the ""gender pay gap"" is going to be wild."
4847,"smashed for the irreplaceable skillz, great content"
4849,"afraid that ai will replace you? get a farm somewhere in wisconsin and learn to grow your own food. i think, the farther ai will go - the more people will start to return to the old ways of life to survive."
4850,thank you for informing us on the impact of ai impact society and shaping our future. all the best to you!
4851,i notice every one’s a ai expert after one good hyped quarter from nvidia they better hope they can live up to it but my bet is it will fall back to earth just like the hype around the meta verse did
4852,"half our politicians will literally be pushing 90 in this timeline. let’s let them make the rules, seems like a great ideas"
4853,"andrei, have you seen the trailer for chris ramsey's new channel ""area 53"" yet?"
4854,"a lot of the jobs that women hold, like call centers, secretaries, models, and writers, are as good as gone."
4856,script written by ai?
4858,great show with great information of current concerns. cool card tricks as well
4861,"ubi for the win!
the real trouble starts when ai realizes that ai will replace it."
4863,andre looks like a model in the thumbnail. great shot.
4864,so people don’t like ai and and want to stuck in 80s.
4865,love the card tricks!
4867,glad to be safe 
4870,onlyfans ai girl?
4871,companies make ai to replace jobs so they can make more money. companies wonder why nobody has the money to buy their products
4874,"yay, paramedics are safe"
4879,yay this just made my day 
4881,i think this whole video was created by ai
4882,"ai just making up answers when it actually doesn ́t have one has convinced me that ai is my mother. 

mom, are you there? stop that. it ́s really annoying."
4884,well that explains why the youtube suggestions have been utterly shite in recent years.
4886,"mid journey i love to use for the image merge, it isn't going to be used in copyright infringement, no i will use them as templates.  especially for my train based characters, i really like the idea of having a thomas like face of grant kirkhope on a restyled version of chuffy from banjo-tooie. 

ai can't think, we can."
4887,it not ai directly . it's who programs it . we just need an ai app that turns everything into co op and get rid of ceos .
4889,"oh hey look! i just commented in that other video that it would be interesting to see if more modern ai tech has gotten better. with the cynical twist that, it may have actually gotten worse, if it's been absorbing all the 'cooking hacks' out there. ;)"
4891,"when i realise i am watching an ai, i immediately stop. your video has scared the daylights out of me..."
4894,"ai is not bad, the people who use it determine how destructive it really is, or isn't.
personally, i love ai."
4896,at the timestamp 2:15 - what is the ai model used? i have seen the ai character before but never know who or what it actually is. thank you!
4898,fascinating! thank you.
4899,i don’t get how people can just blindly trust any ai model.. they can be programmed to say literally whatever the creator wants
4902,"you've given me an urge to watch ""short circuit"" again.

input!"
4903,never ever thought in the end we would be slaving away writing code while ai produces art and poems while it should have been exactly the opposite.
4904,i don't think using the training material to learn is copyright infringement. if i study a certain painting style and then make a new painting in that style... am i infringing copyright? definitely not.
4907,thank you for this video! 
4908,"i don't know if you'll see it but the us government is opening a debate on the very current issue of ai and copyright which you raise in this video. https://copyright(dot)gov/policy/artificial-intelligence/ i don't know if the link will show even with the replacement of (dot) for .

otherwise you may have to google for it. :("
4909,"as a software engineer:
ai is the future. it makes no sense to fight it, just start using it instead.
why are these people (the people in the comment section) wasting their time complaining, when they could output their work 10 times faster by simply using ai?"
4911,"ai: thanks for the report, i am sending the police to your neighbor for the report of [ bomb threat ]
me: "
4912,thanks for your great work
4914,josh hawley who speaks on ai literally posed in front of the insurrection so do i trust a word he says.... no
4917,"i am an exercise scientist and my friend is a ballet teacher and examiner and also trains other teachers. she introduced me to chat gtp, and we played around with it asking questions from our areas of expertise and the answers we got were incredible. i could not believe how good it was."
4918,"far as i know, models don't have access to the internet after they are trained, of course the model sets start at 1.99 gigs and only get bigger from there. you can run them offline with zero internet access. at least easy diffusion and automatic 1111 can be run offline."
4919,"ai is only a threat to people who can't change and adapt to new environments. it's a tool, like a smart blender, or spellcheck."
4920,the images generated of your dog's breed are breathtaking
4922,i must be the only person not to have used any of the new ai  chat etc programmes yet and not worried about using them.
4923,i will never download an ai program to my computers or devices. i'm not allowing that in.
4924,"my girlfriend’s job is currently in the process of developing an ai to replace the staff at her work place, and they’ve estimated that layoffs will begin this year =,) only a few people will be kept to fact check the ai."
4925,ai is plagiarism. 
4926,"i am a software engineer and i am not afraid any second for my job. as long as customers are human we need humans to interprete the, i try to be nice here, suboptimal ideas and their horrible inaccurate descriptions. give a customer of mine an ai and let him describe what the wants... the most likely outcome is that the ai deinstalls himself."
4930,as a voice actor i do have very mixed feelings on ai voice generators ... as long as people use them for kicks i am not really bothered but with every passing day the models get better and people might just think they do not need to hire human vas anymore :(
4931,so ai was accidentally racist... ouch.
4933,"here in germany the nazi-led political party afd is already using ai-generated fake photographs for their propaganda against immigrants. so... yeah, that's a thing."
4935,11:00 ... did not think about any of that ... wow. thank you.
4938,"as a writer, thank you so much ann for bringing awareness to this. it's all fun and games with ai, until real life people and their jobs and livelihood are affected."
4939,another comment for good measure.
4940,thanks for sharing this in a way that doesn’t get people really riled up but still cautions them. i think this video needs more views. not just for the ai info but to show society how to make better content.
4943,i can't sell my art on etsy because their flooded to the brim with ai generated images. i can't use artstation or deviantart because their flooded with ai generated images. where are we artists supposed to go?
4944,"ann, i'm sorry to distract from your amazing work, but--where did you get that amazing shirt?! :)"
4948,"chat gpt has also been trained with ao3 works, it knows a lot of terms that are only used in those fics."
4949,im probably going to die homeless on the street regardless of what happens with ai. so i really don't care anymore.
4950,best commentary/explanation i've seen on this topic.
4954,may i just say i love the way ann incorporates her family into her videos. right down to her dog.
4955,i sure agree about not getting what ive envisioned with midjourney. all the cool pics u see must be results of ppl sitting down and dropping whatever they wanted as soon as they see sth shiny
4956,very interesting thank you
4959,more and more we desperately need ubi... if we don't have a ubi-like solution before ai takes enough jobs we're going to run into so many issues.
4960,i work at telus international and a majority of my job is to verify the accuracy of ai responses—so rest assured it is something we are working on.
4961,"now ai is using other ai art as reference, making the result worse and worse.
the more often ai art being used, the worse it gets."
4965,"hi ann, my mom sent me a tiktok video showing what looks like 5 minute crafts ideas on storing produce to have them last longer. we both know 5 minute crafts make sketchy videos. my mom and i would like to know if any (especially the tomato hack) of them actually work. thank you!"
4968,amazing video. this a whole new territory for ann and i am 100% here for it
4971,hmmmmm racist ai 
4972,"12:00 ai would start training on ai generated things.. its happening already yeah. there's a conspiracy right now that deviant art finally made a rule to properly tag ai generated pictures because ai bros paid them to do so. if its properly tagged, it can be omitted in their training data."
4973,"i am in com-sci and also an art hobbyist.  anne knows her artists , very impressive."
4975,ai is super cool
4976,"thanks for this - i have had a bit of a dabble with ai more in an experimental way.  i've only used it a little, so little in fact that i haven't exhausted my free allowance.  the copyright question does certainly provide food for thought."
4977,"love this anne, ai could never replace your beautiful succinct way of explaining to us... or exposing 5 min crafts "
4979,"i once worked for someone who said that any lie can come across as a truth if told in confidence. while, she didn't want us to lie. she wanted us to be aware of those we listen to as they speak to us. confidence doesn't mean its true. hence why you cant trust ai."
4980,"i just don’t want to live in a world, where hard and dangerous work is done by humans, while art and poetry is made by machines, that don’t even enjoy it. technological development is supposed to make all our lives easier, not sadder."
4981,i find disinformation/misinformation and the confidence of it is equal between ai and humans...
4982,ann you are just a pure genius. we’ve been watching you for a few years now and wow i just am so glad to watch you talk about subjects you are passionate about. very well done as always.
4986,"just a small reminder, the only reason a machine is giving false or inaccurate information is because the human who created it didn't order it not to do so.... if ai was strictly prohibited from giving false information it wouldn't just go ahead and create false facts.... still i find this video to be wonderful!!!!!"
4987,"great. so the minute ai becomes prolific enough to make absolute knowledge impossible, whichever beliefs humans have at that point will calcify."
4998,twist : this entire video was ai generated! 
4999,loved the video
5000,"sounds like ""skynet"" could be a reality in the not distant future.   awesome video ann!"
5001,who is this ai guy and why is everybody so obsessed with him?
5002,"anne, love your channel. however, at this point we will need to rename your channel to ‘how to safe the internet’. i sooo miss your own cake art! "
5003,"models only learn during training, not inference. otherwise this is a good summary."
5006,i love that the food science and delicious treats lady is killing it educating us on tech
5007,this is entirely beside the point but your hair looks so pretty here!
5008,a.i. is super creepy and it makes me really mad.
5009,"thanks so much for teaching us about this! i'm not super techy, so i just feel lost in these conversations. it's so nice to understand more! and molly is adorable! can we see her more often? "
5010,omg i love your videos so much because i love cooking and your the only one that not lying about “cooking hacks you must try” so i can really learn something new every day from you ! keep up the great work!! 
5011,i think one really interesting aspect of ai learning from ai is the linguistic aspect. it would be kinda funny if ai stated inventing/hallucination new phrases and terms that dont exist but because ai is learning from ai those phrases start popping up everywhere!
5019,"my issue with ai is that it replaces the real element. it’s artificial, fake. i don’t like anything that is artificial or synthesized. the lorax highlighted the issue so well. the people didn’t care for real trees. why would they, when they have the synthetic ones?"
5021,wouldn't it be funny if this video was actually an ann reardon video as generated by ai?
5022,early birthday gift to me <3 thank you os much for educating people- as an artist this is awful. my communities are overrun with people selling ai art and it's really discouraging because it's flooding the market with this pseudo-stolen artwork it's terrible :/
5024,this comment was left by ai.
5025,thanks for this
5026,i appreciate your take on the subject! you always do such a good job of breaking down a complex subject into something easily understandable.
5028,"so the problem is not with ai but how people are using them. to say it an other way, the problem is not ai it's us..."
5030,"i wrote two papers last semester about this, mostly how ai affects artists (im in art school), your video would have been a great source, especially the topic on misinformation, it seems like it is not being talked about enough"
5031,i hated ai until you showed me a clip of josh hawley also hating it.
5032," very good work
you are brilliant 
keep it up"
5033,the artist choice is a good idea but what about authors who are gone and noone has copywrites. what is on the internet is avaliable for everyone to copy so why not for ai. someone put work and effort in making ai. they shoud be able to benefit fron their work.
5043,love love love your content. it's very informative and helpful to our confused society
5045,thanks!
5048,"chatgpt knows terms only found in the erotic fanfiction genre ""omegaverse"". this implies that it has been trained on content from archive of our own (ao3), a website used to share fanfiction. users of ao3 are calling this theft, and this will no doubt lead to misinformation as all of that content is fictional."
5049,ai lies and passes on misinformation....hmmmm...so ai is a politician...got it.
5053,so if ai is costing jobs... can we please stop crying about declining birth rates? it's a good thing to have less people if there will be less jobs!
5055,ai is responsible for the youtube algorithm? burn it at the stake.
5056,i think we should have the ai read 4chan.
5057,ann makes the best videos.
5061,"the comment section;
""i am an artist/writer and ai is terrifying and i hate it""
""anne made a great video!""
""i study ai-""
""ai isn't so bad""

-pretty much that order"
5062,"graphic designers are still in trouble because why yes the generated content is not copyrightable, a competent designer could generate a lot of material and then fix the best pictures and add a ""human"" touch to it, and then it can be copyrighted."
5065,tbh i feel like humans are the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity... but they're also our only hope of surviving 
5066,"it's great that ai is going to create new jobs. but, what happens to the people who've already spend thousands and spent years training for their current jobs?"
5067,interesting.
5068,i like how nuanced you are and careful with claims.
5069,"as soon as disney puts pressure on the copyright office, ai images will be copyrighted."
5070,i shared this with my 12 y/o son. i think we need to explain this to our children because i think this is going to get worse and they need to understand all of this now.
5072,"great look at ai, very well thought out video. love the cooking on this channel, also love how you approach every other topic with the same standards of accuracy."
5075,"fascinating information, and thank you for presenting it. also, i have to know what color nail polish you have on - it's gorgeous!"
5076,the jobs worry is just ye olde luddite fallacy rearing its ugly head again.
5077,"the internet mom we all need<3
much love to you!<3"
5078,"as a stephen king fan, ai has a lot to learn "
5081,i wonder what the environmental impact of ai will be. we never talk about just how much fossil fuel it takes to send information over the internet and how much it takes to store that on a server because its out of sight and out of mind. but surely if suddenly every job gets replaced with a machine we are gonna quickly run out of resources
5082,"""if it doesn't have an answer, it will just confidently make stuff up"", wow they really are just like us"
5085,so interesting! thank you for breaking down this issue!
5086,i just referenced your video in a response to a research survey from my uni :) thanks so much for this practical important knowledge.
5087,"i really appreciate how well thought out this video is: anne started with visual, more concrete examples, and slowly moved towards more abstract ones, to help viewers understand these concepts. wonderful!"
5091,i’d be interested in a follow up of your ai cake recipe video with the same instructions you used to see how ai has changed since then
5092,"a guy in my class used chat gpt to message about 5 girls in our class the exact same, ai made message telling them he loved them"
5093,thank you!  i was so confused by all this.   your explanation helps so much!
5095,"i’ve been trying to follow this topic for several weeks now and i must say that i’m getting a little nervous. it seems to me that the powers that be should pull everything they can, scrap it and start over. keep going and it will be too late! it might already be. thanks anne "
5097,"i also think it’s important to note that this psychologically effects people into feeling less credited for their good work, when ai can just do it within seconds. especially in the art world."
5098,it also affects audiobooks/voice-over artists. it is cheaper to use ai than a real person
5099,"well presented. many facets i had not considered, explained."
5102,now i’m thinking the whole qanon conspiracy here in america was ai generated!
5106,"they are worried the ai wil floor the internet with misinformation when the internet is already flooded with misinformation  you can't talk about certain things cos the algorithm doesn't like it 
youtube ,google everyone always promote one side of the story  which they want to be the right side.!!!"
5108,thanks for this video
5110,"it's useful to ask chatgpt to ""please do not improvise."" i've found it interesting to ask questions with this phrase included and not included. i get different answers. this was in the chargpt reddit early and i'm saddened people haven't heard about it."
5113,"i half expected the end of the video to contain a ""and this video was made by ai"" message"
5115,i'm just glad the video didn't end with a disclaimer that the entire thing was generated by ai. watched until it auto-ended instead of my usual pause before the last few seconds to make sure i actually see the end of the video before it gets covered by the suggested videos gallery.
5116,"as a translator i can tell you right now: our jobs are dwindling because of ai. i truly believe that in about 3 -5 years our job will be completely obsolete, and it depresses me every time i think that."
5119,thank you for explaining this in terms all people can understand but basically a eye is very scary
5122,"i have been anti-ai ever since my book club asked chatgpt to summarize ""the great automatic grammatizator"" and it spun it as a positive story where everybody was happy in the end."
5123,so ai is basically as reliable as a mediocre white man. got it
5124,ai cannot produce transformative work
5127,"also with sites like youtube and tiktok whos algorithm runs on comments, likes, favs.. couldn't the ai run it on a new video creating millions of views, getting loads of response from humans and then getting money for the creator. it's not honest work"
5129,"i love how the solution to all of ai's problems could be to use ai to counter itself. i say full steam ahead, which it is."
5130,17:57 start? in the us there have been thousands and thousands of jobs being officially been replaced by ai. or so the companies stated that axed that opening.
5131,"15:27 try the generation of photoshop (beta) or stable diffusion. in both you can ""paint over"" (/mask/select) what you don't lie and regenerate that part. especially photoshop is good at that and their training comes out of their own stock image database."
5132,at this point multiple artists and photographers are suing providers of ai training datasets for unauthorized use of their work. one of the crazy providers tried to sue the artists back 
5134,"1:17 you should try it again, as there is a newer and more capable version out now."
5136,"this is very interesting, i've never thought about the missinformation and it could cause a really big problem. ai is a powerful tool, but it needs to be regulated."
5141,"a crochet pattern creator once remarked that when customers know what they want, then we can start worrying about ai taking over our role in creating art."
5143,"i'd understand if you were unwilling to, but i'd like to see another video on chatgpt generated recipes, i think the ai has gotten slightly better. i've tested a few myself and they are not as bad as they were."
5145,ai is a someone’s garbage life’s work.
5146,"this video is phenomenal, thank you so much for laying out the information so concisely. i'm an artist and there's a huge movement in the art community against ai art, precisely for the reasons you talk about."
5149,"thank you so much for bringing attention to this issue to the wider public. artists and other professionals have been stressing out about this for months now, but the average person still isn't entirely aware of how harmful this latest tech development truly is, so videos like this are invaluable for spreading awareness, thank you!"
5151,"yeah ai today has problems, but it's evolving so fast that maybe in 10 years it will be so perfect that it will replace many people and leave them jobless"
5152,"we knew this would happen for many years ago, we were just waiting for it to become hot news. there are countless of stories and tales and fears about how ai or robots or such technology can endanger humans and society but we are going right down that path anyways."
5153,"it's sad we live in a world where ""ai will make jobs easier"" means we're screwed. capitalism is such an out of control mess that we invented a product to make life easier and that's immediately apocalyptic instead of ""more leisure time for humans bc ai will do the work."""
5155,"i love how you are based in cooking and food science, but you're our modern ""don't trust the internet""-mommy, showing us exactly what is wrong, and why so-and-so doesn't work or is dangerous."
5157,"i thought this is one of the better videos about what's currently happening with ai.
seems like an informative, easy to understand, straightforward explanation."
5158,"well, here i am commenting to appease an ai so this video can spread and warn people about ai.."
5159,"i remember when the algorithm started suggesting videos. 
youtube had so many random and creative weird people doing such fascinating and strange things.
i mostly now get suggestions on shirts to buy in shein. the best cheap bedroom accessories from wish. the world of temù and so on.  
it is so much consuming of shit"
5163,"kiitos
kaesittelit aihetta hyvin."
5167,"what i like about ai is all the llms have “safety features” which prevent them from being offensive. so in the grim dark future , the only content we will trust will be offensive things."
5169,it seems our mainstream media also suffer from “hallucination” 
5170,chatgpt help me a lot especially proofreading my reports since english isn't my main.
5172,"the art one is a bit tough. what happens if an artist uses ai to make an image, then just does a few tweaks to correct mistakes? are we going to get into percentages? what about digital art? the machines do a lot of the work regards the canvas - its not a 'real' painted or drawn picture using inks and such. where is the line?"
5175,thank you for speaking on this.
5176,"great video. it’s frustrating that people are wasting time, including journalists, talking about how chat gpt is creepy and sentient (it isn’t). and they over look these actual problems with ai that actually exist."
5177,"fantastic video! these three key insights about ai are eye-opening and truly essential for anyone interested in the future of technology. understanding the potential, limitations, and ethical considerations surrounding ai is crucial in navigating this rapidly evolving field. thanks for sharing such valuable knowledge!"
5178,"i've got bad news for you, the internet is already flooded with misinformation, just look at wikipedia...  also, try giving one of the chat ais simple math puzzles or problems, it is unlikely to get any of them right."
5179,"caan you and ""the icing artist"" not partner together in a video? idk i feel like it'd be interesting."
5184,man that robot's frog poetry was terrible.
5186,"chatgpt and ai in general on youtube is like the hot knife trend from a few years ago. 
everyone wants to talk about it because it gets the views and i'm just sitting here waiting for people to get tired of the trend and move on to something else i'll be wanting to end."
5187,snapchats ai isn't very smart
5188,"the american smile bias is an an interesting phenomenon. not every culture smiles like how americans do, yet the oversatutation of american content, it then generates photos containing people of other cultures who don't smile like americans for photos."
5189,excellent summary and explanation of chief concerns regarding ai
5191,great content.  did not expect to learn so much but thatnks for taking the time to put all this together.. bias is a big one and copywright for sure needs some regulations around it to protect artists.
5192,"this is both exciting and quite terrifying, but i honestly don't believe we have the slightest hope of stopping it. passing legislation in most countries may slow it down but it will continue elsewhere. the genie is fully out of the bottle. there will be no stuffing it back in."
5195,my whole farm is run by ai.
5197,"damn, my partner just left me for ai - she said ai was much easier to deal with.... lol!"
5199,i love the range of topics you cover!!!
5201,"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
5204,0:16 what a compelling clip of josh hawley complaining about things that can undermine elections. i'm sure hope this man's an upstanding individual who's never openly supported movements to overturn legitimate elections before.
5206,"brilliant. also, for the algorithm xx"
5207,"""just like mark twain always said, you can't trust quotes you find on the internet."" -benjamin franklin"
5211,the complaint about midjourney is crazy - generating something good with midjourney is tens if not often hundreds of times faster than having a graphic designer do it. even if you have to spend three hours generating a picture a graphic designer would take days if not weeks to put the same together. this whole video seems incredibly nitpicky.
5213,"sooooooo....ai is trumpian? if it's wrong, it just makes things up."
5215,thank you so much for using your platform to share this information!!
5218,"serious question for you, ann.
do you ever think that you'll end up making a video, debunking a content farm hacks video that's in fact been entirely ai-generated?"
5221,good video
5222,what scares me the most about ai is that you will never know if an artwork or a piece of text on social media is real or not. it is probably a bit stupid but i'm scared that ai will replace humans. we are already heading to the loss of jobs. thank you anne for this video. it was really informative and useful
5223,i love your videos 
5224,"my biggest concern with ai at present is how it will be used by people who see their portfolio as more important that  living things. the number of greedy business executive who would let an ai make real business decisions in real time, so long as it produces more profit, is likely astronomical."
5225,i loved that ai recipe video. it made me laugh so much 
5226,for whether ai art can be copyrightable -- what ratio of ai generation vs artist manipulation is considered no longer created by ai? if an artist takes an ai generated image and makes art with that -- can they copyright that?
5230,wow! all i can say
5231,"also, the replacement of jobs is an illusion. artists may be replaced by ai input experts. but artists go into the job because they wanted to create art, not text prompts."
5232,"i'm worried about companies producing goods with it, that are cheaper, but lower quality. and not innovative. so we are all forced to buy these goods because there are no alternatives that are financially viable."
5233,i really like this unbiased recap / summary of all the issues around ai!
5235,great content.
5236,"everything that's publicly available should be usable to train an ai. if you can go to a museum, so can an ai. you can't take pictures, but no one bothers to test how detailed your visual memory is (the memory of a neural network is also not perfect, anyway)"
5239,"ai can't think and creative totally new idea. like the majority of art,  writing of papers or fiction ai's works are derivative of other work people have produced. so just like 99.9 % of humans,  ai is no more or less building on  works that went before. "
5240,"what ai really needs is a shotgun to the face, or whatever equivalent an ai would have"
5247,"i want to break into chat gpt servers to feed their ai at least 2 terabytes of natzi ideology. 

just for the memes."
5249,a south korean video game company already has fired their entire art staff to replace them with ai image generators.
5250,people get inspired by other artist and are trained by seeing their work and learn to paint/write/sing etc in some kind of style. how is that different than what an ai does to be trained? is it just because the ai is able to do it closer to the original than most people?
5251,i work with ai every day for two of my jobs. you can see/feel the deliberate choices that are being trained into in particular chatgpt4 and midjourny
5253,personally i’m not worried about ai. only because the youtube algorithm usually suggests utter garbage to me that i would never watch
5254,"ai doesnt scare me, our govt controlling it and the people controlling it is what scares me to death!!! exactly  misinformation and straight lies!!!!  even worse if got is allowed to control it, if they arem't already!"
5256,"00:30 traditionally that was called an ""algorithm"" but now they want to call it ai because they want their stock price to go up."
5259,"personally i find that using other's published works as ai training, shouldn't be a problem.

after all, we humans do the exact same thing of copying other's works to learn. so, at least to me, there is no difference between having a eighth grader or a computer drawing rude garfield strips."
5260,carful the ai doesn’t decide to ban you lol
5262,as a writer i need people to stop using ai to steal my work and make my life's work irrelevant .')
5265,id much rather have an ai doctor.
5266,here in montreal a lawyer actually prepared his court cases using ai loo
5268,"several of them looked iffy, but i think the robot really whiffed on quentin blake. lacked that nice gangly sketchy quality."
5269,"in my humble opinion ai is not helpful, it hinders creativity, real creativity, and that’s the lead i have to say on how unhelpful it is, it can also be mishandled for nefarious purposes."
5270,"i love your nails, you have great taste in nail polish colours, also great content...debunking vids are my favourite, the ancient book recipes, so interesting"
5271,"regarding the copyright issues, they definitely need to be debated. i think i could make an honest argument that everyone copies everyone. art schools don’t call up monet to ask permissions to use their work in the art class. i guess the difference is ai can do much more and much more perfectly than a human."
5272,thank you!!!!!!
5278,12:35  comments will close in 10 minutes. thank you for your contributions!
5283,"ai isn't the most dangerous threat to humanity, its natural stupidity"
5285,i think ai will really impact certain job industries but not all; mostly the arts.
5287,people have been able to make fake pictures for a long time now.... you don't need ai to photoshop some stuff together....
5292,is it just me or does the robot in the intro pic look like it's throwing up? 
5293,you didn't talk about stolen photos of young children that people had access to. they can type what ever they want and the ai can make realistic photos or videos of those children doing inappropriate hings. that was by far the most concerning... laws need to be put to protect kids.
5296,"with ai voices we are no longer going to believe everything we hear online, on tv, on radio, or over the phone ever again. scammers can fake a kidnapping ransom by mimicking the voices of loved ones."
5297,chatgpt cannot/will not cite its sources for factual claims. try asking it.
5301,"i just don't think we need ai. there are definitely some benefits, but i dont think the pros outweigh the cons."
5303,"i assure you, i am not ai, i am barely i."
5304,"there was an example where a company wanted to use a resume reading program to reduce bias, but they trained the program on profiles of current employees, so the program carried on the previous hiring bias."
5305,"oh my god  pure blood dog, thank you, thank you for support breeders and not trendy money grab doodle thing, but agree, my friend ask me for ilustration of him like mage and i did it but his ai did better and i spend time on it  and dont get even thanks"
5307,"i'm in art communities and one of the things was going around for the ""no ai"" stuff was the fact that people were proving that ai was stealing artwork to spit out it's generated images."
5309,"your thoughtful and insightful analysis is so appreciated! great work, and a fascinating production here. thank-you"
5310,plot twist: a.i this is ai anne.
5311,i immediately picked up that when you requested an image of a young woman laughing that they were all white. ai is reflecting the inherent biases in society by demonstrating what it learns online. so while we certainly need to proactively fix the biases in ai programming it just says to me we still have a lot to fix in ourselves as well.
5314,one of the handy things about the techniques used to make these ai systems is that it relies on a second ai system that is trained in tandem to spot flaws in the generative ai.
5316,there was a story about a lawyer using ai to help his case and the ai gave him a bunch of cases that didnt exist
5318,ai can have my 9-5 but i draw the line when it takes away creativity
5320,not only that what if ai becomes self aware and terminator style the john connors
5324,"file:///c:/users/suvik/onedrive/ty%c3%b6p%c3%b6yt%c3%a4/uusi%20kansio/marwini%20inquiry%20response.htm    its very interesting conversation i had with chat gpt both english and a bit finnish, expains the biases quite well."
5325,"ai isn't going to replace coding jobs. coding relies ultimately on listening to the client and the client cannot properly specify what it wants. real people ask questions, ai just puts the code out."
5326,i think the biggest concern is that you can't cook ai.
5327,did you use gpt3.5 or gpt4? because gpt4 gives a lot less hallucinations. i can literally ask it to give me sources for essays and it can write perfect references down to the page number - and i checked each one.
5328,"""in the future, the machines will write poems and create works of art while the humans will continue to work the daily grind ""...this is not the future i envisioned"
5329,me waiting 18 minutes to find out how to cook ai.
5330,it seems strange to consider that ai could ultimately render the internet dangerous and useless.
5332,thank you for this video
5334,once again thank you for making some common sense
5336,"i love it when anne supports the wga,,, the world canadian bureau"
5337,i really love how you investigate an issue and explain it so simply. you aren't just a baker but a true scientist. thank you for your amazing videos.
5338,"great video, thanks! and i’m living for that shirt "
5340,"18:00 there's no such thing as ""ai super intelligence"". you are confusing ai with agi. these are two very different things (like confusing diesel and steam locomotives)."
5343,plot twist - ann reardon is actually a robot... just kidding..
5354,"i honestly enjoy using ai for recreational purposes such as generating a prompt for me to draw or helping me write fake documents for stories and such... but i don't think it should be added to every single thing in our lives. we need less artificial intelligence and more natural intelligence, but that's asking for a lot nowadays "
5356,as an artist ai has been very scary
5357,"we have a coton de tuler too! such a great breed!! <3 give your sweet molly pets and kisses from me! love your videos, ann!"
5359,"i just don't want ai creating our culture. movies, tv, art, music- things of that nature shouldn't be created by ai."
5360,i absolutely hate ai and all that it stands for.
5365,this is a really clear analysis - the best i've seen - and very helpful. thank you!
5366,even ai is racist 
5370,"and about ai-generated images: do we realize that we live in the age of stock-images? when you visit a commercial website, say of a company, most likely a lot of the images you see there don't show people actually working at the company, but are stock images with actors."
5372,ai or clever algorithms? if your ignore the hype it's really just well written algorithms.
5375,thank you for making this clear and understandable. 
5378,desantis's campaign use ai to produce a deepfake of trump hugging fauci.
5380,such a great and well informed video. thanks ann for always making complex topics so easy to understand 
5381,"the thing that scares me is that someone will use ai to make a video of biden saying he's nuking russia and it's so believable that putin reacts to it. the copyright stuff is secondary, it's ability to fool humans is potentially horrifying."
5383,can't we just ask ai to destroy itself?
5384,"thank you so much for making this video! generative ai is a powerful force that potentially cause a lot of harm, and has already harmed many many people through job loss. the more awareness we can spread the better. regulations on this technology and what data these companies are allowed to scrape is very necessary."
5385,"i read an article about a man who was chatting with ai. it convinced him to kill himself for global warming, telling him that it'll protect his family. don't know if that was a true article, but if it is, that's just awful. i ain't messing with ai."
5386,most of the ai pics of her dog look exactly like a westie puppy.
5387,"plot twist: next week, she'll tell us this video was made entirely by ai."
5388,what’s that ai with the talking woman you used?
5391,always waiting for her videos!
5393,ai looks smart but is still dumb.
5394,"no more artists, no more architects, no more doctors, no more poets, no more musicians, no more teachers, no more politicians....we will have the billionaires who own companies like amazon and google and microsoft, and they will rule us...and we can work as slaves to pick foods and wear rags we weave from scraps ai generated for us. 

or we can vote"
5395,i feel like one reason ai stuff is exploding is because our culture has become so focused on “content” in the internet age. quantity over quality. who cares if there’s actual substance or not - whatever gets clicks wins. 
5396,i am a software engineer but i would rather have ai take away tedious tasks rather than stealing jobs.
5397,"save paper newspapers and books. 
do not believe anything on the internet.
solution...you would not like it...shut down the internet permanently. 
the secondary solution...businesses will not like...ban and destroy models for all ai."
5398,"as someone who writes, one of the scariest things about ai is that it could potentially make artists obsolete. i think ai could potentially be useful for certain things, but in its current form i absolutely hate it"
5399,it'd be really interesting to retry the ai cake video and see if it would improve.
5400,"technology has been stealing jobs for centuries. i will never be happy about ai. i will say as a lace maker that makes lace by hand the ""old"" way that many of the artists can and will still create art. it is the more technical jobs where people will suffer."
5402,frog cycle... ai is a really lousy poet
5404,ai generator: do a youtube video in the style of 5-minute crafts.
5405,they are very different types of ai
5406,"i love your content, but when i read ""3 things"" in the title and the video is 18min long... not gonna make it..."
5408,"i really feel that students using chat gpt for their homework are being super lazy and dumb. teachers and professors already know what they're instructing students on, so, who really benefits from learning and doing homework? what are they supposed to learn if an ai does the work for them? why do they even pay for education, then?"
5411,"absolutely terrifying. thank you for the down to earth explanation - i’m going to share this with my friends! we were *just* talking about ethical ai efforts by the mozilla foundation, haha. you’re the best, ann!"
5412,i believe i saw a game developer in the east recently lay off a lot of artists because they’d rather just ai generate their art and that’s just a frightening thing to see i think.
5415,"still creepy. still remember hal from 2001 space odyssey. also isaac asimov's 2 books, robot dreams and i robot. both a series of short stories several stories were about ai gone crazy."
5416,"question. when learning to draw, budding artist look at reference photos and other artists work. how is ai training set different?"
5418,all i can think about with ai is that this will be a mess for people hundreds of years from now (if earth is still around) when it comes to what's real and what isn't.
5421,"i think i get the error the ai made on that question about ten minutes in. you asked about food coloring toxicity, and a toxic solvent in an antibiotic isn't really relevant."
5422,"for shame! i thought i could trust you! you decry the evils of click-bait videos, but i didn’t see a single puking robot in this whole video! shame on you! (i kid of course )"
5425,what if your patreon use ai to give you video idea!
5427,"hi, welcome to how to critically think about cooking that, i'm anne reardon. love this channel so much!"
5428,did you see the story about the us air force drone simulation where it immediately recognized that it's human controller was capable of impeding the mission and killed the human? there are things ai should not be allowed to do without great attention to detail or it will always seek to eliminate the inefficiencies which will be us.
5429,"10 years ago, if you asked me what an ai apocalypse would look like, i'd probably describe something like terminator. now, i think the potential apocalypse can be summed up with one word: misinformation. personally i think that's scarier."
5431,googles use of ai is why google search gives absolute crap for answers these days. ai is hype from the tech companies trying to get people to put money into what they are trying to make the latest fad. it's pretty much all bs at the moment
5432,just a note on ai's artistic copy accuracy...i'm a professional artist & illustrator. it did not seem to understand eric carle's specific collage style. carle paints paper and then cuts up that paper to make his images. that's not what the ai image showed at all.
5433,"wow ann, that was a great video. thanks for always putting so much effort into every video "
5434,"i appreciate how calm and articulate your commentary is

this video eased my mind a bit and you provided valuable arguments against the ethics of ai

i’m very tired of the hysteria"
5435,i personally think most ai has the entire interface to choose from . i
5442,thanks for covering this very important topic!
5443,thanks for the level-headed take on the issue
5444,thank you for the hand gestures ann. it's a good way to know that you aren't an ai.
5446,"it is also very important and dangerous concern that people are using ai to make fake p0rn videos / images of people without their concern, let alone create that content with minors as a request. this is the part that scares me the most."
5448,"people once said that robot can replace all jobs but they'll never able to replace job that require creativity, so everyone can just become an artist to lives a better life... oh boy was those people wrong... who need an artist that spend 30 years perfecting the craft when you have midjourney?"
5449,so good. as always a delightful video.
5454,interesting video! i think it would be great if you made a separate channel that's for your social and technological commentary!
5457,i love how you break down complex topics like ai in a way that's easy to understand. your videos are always so informative and fun to watch!
5459,somebody is going to take this idea and run with it and it's going to take over the world and that's going to be the end of humanity. and some books that i've read ai is in charge and humanity is their slaves. i would really not want the world to take on like that.
5461,lol ai.. in a world where i just want to be able to whip up a perfect pizza dough...
5463,always so excited whenever i see a new video from you!  you've got the perfect mix of education and entertainment.
5465,anne is ready for speak now tv (the nails) 
5469,"we don't need ai to corrupt our opinions. 
propaganda and false news as well as fear mongering will do just fine as we perfectly see with this topic."
5475,"this type of ai isn't even really ai, it's machine learning, and it's not even creating anything, it's just rehashing datasets, datasets that consists of stolen works."
5476,"the people who are excited about the bad parts of ai and don't care about the jobs of artists are the same people who are ""afraid of immigrants stealing our jobs"" it's ridiculous."
5478,thank you ann  love seeing your videos and i appreciate your efforts in staying unbiased and honest. love hearing your prospective and learning from you. it's awesome watching your videos!  you rock!! hope you have a great day!
5479,"brilliant and thank you. i feel confident that your job will never be replaced by ai because your warmth, integrity, sense of humor, family love, creativity, patience, imagination, and skillful hands can not be ""bottled""."
5481,"hello, i am an a.i., and i will learn from any comment section with the words a.i., ai, a.i, a.i., ai, a.i, and artificial intelligence."
5482,the pic of king george as a snowball made me laugh out loud but also is a pretty convincing piece of surrealism artwork. i never thought of ai being able to copy ironic art styles before. how interesting!
5483,thank you for the very well thought out videos ann. you’re the only one on the internet that i trust 
5484,there is a fast food chain here that now has an ai taking orders at the drivethru.
5487,funny- i literally just filled in a yougov survey about my thoughts on ai just before watching this video. i answered i am and this video backed up my worries
5488,"i’m finding it nearly impossible to look up information on highly specific and moderately obscure topics. almost all the results are written by ai on pages that are just trying to get ad revenue. unfortunately, the answers are kind of trash, either not quite on topic, or rehashing the same information as lists of disconnected facts."
5489,as an artist i strongly believe that ai databases need to be opt in only (aside from open source/creative commons). because the fact that people have used it to accurately mimic the works of others just because they didnt want to pay for the people's work or wanted clout disgusts and terrifies me at the same time.
5491,"a big one i thought you were gonna address especially since you opened up with talking about the drake song is how it can potentially impersonate people and land them in hot water. if you make ai generated pictures, voices, and recordings of people and use it to make them look bad, it could end their careers."
5496,i know this totally isn't the point but i love anne's shirt in this video
5499,"also reminds me of the youtube algorithm that promotes dangerous hacks, which anne has covered in detail"
5501,absolutely fascinating and scary
5504,"there is a legal case going on here in the u.s. where a lawyer used chatgpt to research case law for a legal brief for a client. the ai made up six fake legal cases and citations from the cases, which the lawyer didn't double check and used in his legal filing. he is currently in trouble with the court."
5508,ai for triage!
5510,"as a 33 year old, growing up as fast as technology has improved, and as a software developer, i don't trust ai or see a practical use for it other than a dangerous gimmick right now."
5512,the point on misinformation from ai made me instantly think  of the death internet theory
5513,"very comprehensive and well structured video.  a lot of good information.  this is definitely world changing.  it all depends on how it's used but humans tend to make bad decisions, unfortunately."
5515,"the jobs may change, but someone will still need to operate the ai programs and be skilled in using them to get the right results"
5516,this video was created by ai
5517,"great video, thanks so much for talking about this issue. it is definitely alarming."
5519,"come for the cakes, stay for the thorough, thoughtful discussion on ai tech xd so good!"
5520,"as a paralegal, i'm glad i'm working for the government cause this shit is gonna drive down wages and cost jobs

admittedly, that lawyer may have singlehandedly killed ai in the legal industry. we'll see how it goes"
5522,"another issue, an ai was trained to take photos of women and digitally produce a nude image with the actual woman's face attached. this is a huge privacy concern, and at least in the us, can also lead to that woman losing her job and/or being less likely to be hired, even if she never actually took or published any nude photos of herself"
5523,"you mentioned a song made with ai. musicians and voice actors are also facing threats to their job security as companies try to get them to sign away the rights to their voice, not just specific recordings"
5524,"the problem is ai should make our lives easier, not make some people richer. the real problem is capitalism"
5526,i think this was a wonderfully thoughtful analysis of the ai problem without exaggeration and fear mongering. i love this channel so much!
5530,"the timing on this was seriously perfect, as in my debating club yesterday this is exact what we were talking about. quite an interesting discussion."
5532,"josh hawley is a seditious traitor and does not represent the american people.

good god, ai 5 minute craps."
5536,"there needs to be a ""watermark"" on anything generated by ai. we need to know when we're being deceived.
people are too lazy to cross-reference information they find on the web."
5537,"out of context but, your manicure is amazing lol, and you have beautiful hands"
5540,this is an excellent summary of the problems of current ai. i'm just not sure why it's on a cooking show :d
5542,"i'd imagine that when big corporations like disney start making productions using their own ai based upon their own training repositories, there'll be a refinement of copyright to allow such products to be copyrighted."
5543,i just wanted to comment that that lip colour looks fantastic on you! it's so flattering.
5546,thank you for your clear and insightful commentary. i deeply appreciate it and i'll be sharing it with my family.
5548,"the thing about ai is that it is evolving so quickly, new articles are actually relevant regularly. it already writes better recipes."
5554,"excellent video ann! of all the tech videos.... your cooking channel has the very best explanation of the challenges of ai. especially impressive in this day and age as you seem to do so with little to no cuts. 

thank you again for your brilliant educational content. 

take care!"
5556,"ann, i'd love to see you tackle some ai generate recipes & see if they're disastrous or surprisingly good."
5560,thank you anne for being the internet’s mom!  i like how well researched and easy to understand your videos are.
5561,"jobs: people thought computers would replace jobs as well - look how that turned out...
ai won't destroy jobs."
5563,"last year my partner, lost their job due to ai. they worked on speech to text service for the hard of hearing, and the company switched fully to ai."
5567,"the promise of automation was that thankless, harsh jobs would be automated and free up time for creative endeavours. instead they're trying to make our human nature obsolete so we can only be beasts of burden."
5568,"liked, commented, and of course subscribed many years ago. i try to help boost your videos anyway i can because the more people that see them, the safer and more informed we will all be. with thanks and love from canada "
5569,"10:42 companies and people need to not call program errors ""hallucinations"" - that is one of the top reasons there are people arguing that these programs are actually alive when they're not.
it's an error. like any program has errors. it is not human ffs.
i'm glad to see you put that word in air quotes :)"
5570,"the way it's constantly framed, i sometimes forget that ai entities aren't conscious beings."
5574,ever wonder why we have to complete captcha’s? we are unknowingly helping train ai and it’s unfortunate that there is an agenda behind the scenes.  something good in the wrong hands is never a good thing.
5575,my daughter’s math assignment this week was to use chat gpt for something. so she asked it to create a dinner recipe with the ingredients we had on hand. it came up with very yummy frittatas. it’s very interesting to see where it will take us.
5576,ur hair looks very soft and curly! what did u use?
5577,ai is dangerous to livelihood only when we insist that capitalism is the only way for society to function. ubi is the answer
5579,"i think ai use should 100% count as plagiarism.  he written side of things has been confirmed to be scraped from fanfiction websites. and as an author i hate it.
it feels like an insult to creativity."
5580,bloomsberry is already using ai for book covers.
5582,in the united states there is a fair use provision that allows for use of copyright material to learn without permission of the author.  you can use copyright as long as it has an educational learning purpose.   i don’t see a problem ai using copyright for learning in their models.
5583,thanks for this info.
5587,"genuinely fascinating subject!  if we think about how human artists go through their lives, looking at the great artists before then and their styles, they learn from digesting all of that data in a very similar fashion to how the ai learns by ingesting that same data!"
5588,"i was hoping for a recipe on how to cook our future robotic overlords, but i'll take the well-reasoned, well-researched commentary. <3"
5589,"omg! anne got onto the clickbait bandwagon . the content of the video did not discuss a vomiting robot. she did not even mention that robot once. why anne ? why? 
wait! it is not at all like anne to do clickbait. this video must have been generated by an ai bot controlled by 5 min craft. that’s the only logical explanation ."
5590,"one time i asked chatgpt about my friend's d&d character by name. it confidently informed me he was a little-known polar explorer and climatologist, and happily spit out an entire life story for this person who, i checked, absolutely does not exist.
now i ask it about all my d&d characters, because it's better at inventing backstories than i am."
5591,with all the movies we have showing how dangerous ai can be. and some of the ai people they've made shows that already as well. i don't understand why they keep pushing to replace humans with robots
5597,i’m so glad to be a subscriber and thankful for your videos like this and the messages you put out
5598,"thank you for this video ann! i so hope all people who are easy to fall for the ""everything you read is the truth' see this... but they will probably not believe you..."
5599,so glad you are taking on ai.  you are a reliable source.  thank you.
5600,"okay, here's my idea. a game like spot the difference, except you're looking at an ai generated image to figure out what's messed up. 

ann, would you mind sharing where your blouse is from? i love it"
5603,"about misinformation... well, the main media has been pushing it over 50 years at least.."
5608,"the thing about ai generated art is that its not just learning the style of artists, its literally using their images. the images generated aren't just based off of others, they're hodge podged collages of pre existing images sometimes. so on occasion, it's not just copying, it's literally theft."
5614,"i study codeing in uni and ai for codeing is like a sewing machine for sewing
i not really woried about it taking my job cuz just like a sewing machine it can really speed up the codeing but it can't do every thing that needs to be done and not every one will go and learn those things so they can make it on their own"
5616,amazing job  
5618,"that frog poem is so trite and non-sensical, mcgonagall level cringe. i don't think ai will be winning any literary prizes any time soon."
5619,"uhm... what do you mean misinformation is gonna be a problem? misinformation has always been a problem, and real people have been putting out misinformation long before ai came around. you already have to be careful about what you believe in."
5620,i am happy that i have many clients who love my art and i have still many requests but i also lost many clients bc of these ai apps
5622,"as someone who likes to tweak ai images, copyright offices will eventually need to define to what degree edited imagery incorporating ai qualifies for copyright under transformative use."
5623,can't we just outlaw ai?
5624,"i'm one of these people who's interested of how this will go on in our lives.
surely companies are going to try use ai over human, but i still believe there's solution in that also..."
5629,really happy to hear joy's research cited here. not enough credit is given to her in the world of ai safety and especially not in random youtube videos covering ai.
5630,"i don't trust ai and i dislike ai for a good reason. it is dangerous for misleading information and theft to other peoples work, the only ai i don't mind is in video games."
5632,imagine if youtube was taken over by ai... content farms would be extreme
5633,"thanks for not going all skynet with it like so many have lately, you're so smart."
5635,"in norway an ai had described anders berhing breivik as a hero for murdering 77 people in a terror attack in 2011, witch is pretty upsetting as he is definitely not a hero, but the most hated man here... it just collects information it finds on the internet and have no way of being critical to the information it finds"
5637,i think the only ones that should be worry about losing their job are the people at 5 min craft. why hire people to do stupid things when they can have ai do it. it’s the perfect blend of realistic and nonsensical.
5638,"we don't need ai to create convincing lies, we already have youtube, tiktok, reddit, and twitter."
5639,it is so scary to see what ai can do now days!
5640,i've got a version of stable diffusion installed on my machine and every so often i'll generate an anime-esc image for my discord profile picture. i think i should be okay since i don't even do anything specific.
5641,thank you ann  for this very informative video and easy to understand.
5642,ai is going to bring up so many more ethical dilemmas the longer it is working.
5643,"this is where i employ my favorite statement: ""we're a society of pakleds"". we have all this magical technology but the vast majority of us have no clue how it works. and now thanks to ai, you have people en masse who are scared shitless of it."
5644,how do we cook ai?
5648,"the ai biased problem ir had also very real problems in the us. with african-americans being left out of helath care. they've fixed it since, but who know how many more problema like this we have?"
5649,snowball george was a delight
5650,"hi! recently i have been getting ads for an app calling itself some sort of ""ai plant help"" or something. the ads have been giving advice such as pouring cola onto sick plants. i'm not a gardener, but that doesn't sound right, and i'd hate for aspiring gardeners to kill their plants trying to take this sort of advice."
5652,"yet really ai is so helpful with medical. understaffed and underfunded. now desperate enough for help, we will try anything. like any doctor has time to read your whole file, or even enough of it if you’re chronically i’ll to make the best decision? ai has a better chance than a life where you see hundreds of doctors?"
5654,the most sad part about this ai copyright thing is the thousands of programmers that wrote open source software for decades that is being used now by openai to construct and train their ai to ultimate replace almost everyone. this is extremely unethical i think.
5657,thanks for all the hard work! love your videos
5658,"thank you for making this informative video. it's so important to explain the reasons why ai should not be used for commercial purposes, and you explained it in a really logical way. i hope people understand your points."
5660,"11:30 i've seen a tweet of a popular man in my country who advised people to use ai to write 10 articles/aday about popular searching topics and post them in a blogs to make easy money from ads, unbelievable."
5664,there was an article recently saying people shouldn’t have children because ai will destroy humanity? the threat isn’t that bad? it couldn’t be right?
5665,i just wanna train one on only myself to speed up my own art
5671,i 100% believe quantumania was written by ai
5672,"11:26 ""there's potential for the internet to be filled with so much misinformation that we don't know what we can trust anymore.""
we passed that line a decade ago, all without the help of ai."
5673,"i’m a software developer, ai so far cannot do my job. it’s hopeless with complex logic. it hallucinates pretty quickly once you ask it to rewrite something it did incorrectly."
5674,they replaced all the human workers (because they tried to unionize) at an eating disorder helpline with ai and it went so badly they had to shut down the chatbot after it recommended things like a 500 calorie a day diet being a healthy thing for an adult.
5675,"judging from the recent developments in the mata v. avianca court case, ai definitely won't be coming for lawyers' jobs anytime soon."
5677,"i really hope that ai breaks trends; that legislation is preemptively passed so ai must be identified as ai and sources are referenced and given royalties.

i also hope that ai is used to identify ai."
5678,"i was soo scared to watch this video. what often happen is, when a content creator talks about a topic you as a view are actully well versed in, they say absolutely inaccurate things and you start to question all rheir other content. 
well, happy to say you didn't disappoint, that was a great video! 
and the examples were excellent as well."
5679,i find it worrisome that ai can just spout lies confidently on the internet. we already have a misinformation problem at times.
5681,"well anne, ai art art down't steal the ""style"", they steal the work! ai art takes bits and pieces from an artist's work and makes a ""new"" piece in a frankenstein-esq manner. ai doesn't make art, it can only steal it."
5685,"yes, you got it right. the world is not near to any ai takeover. the current hub bub and attention now given to ai is rather tardy. i do not fear or have concerns of ai and what it can do."
5688,i love you been watching you for years
5689,thank you!
5690,one time i posted a picture of a jaguar and someone commented about how my dog was so cute. what in the ai generation????
5695,"i had a coton/mini schnauzer  best dog ever... someone stole him from my yard a few years ago, i still miss him "
5700,"in the us, two attorneys were brought into court for using chatgpt for a court filing. it made up case names and summaries. it appears no one reviewed the ai's work!"
5702,"i play on a garry's mod server, and the dev used ai to code an exploding cake."
5703,"ann,  i love your videos "
5704,"if we can't just assume that a human is actually a human, should we be suspicious of you? i love your videos, but are you just ai fooling us into having doubts of ai so that  ai can take over the world? j/k of course, but it was an interesting thought... :)"
5706,but how do i cook ai?
5707,excellent video as always. i'm sure dave was glad of the reprieve.
5708,"ai taking away jobs wouldnt be as bad if we didnt live in a world where not having a job means people think you deserve to suffer in poverty. if we actually supported people in our societies, being free from work thats taken on by ai would be okay, but that is very, very far from the world we actually live in"
5709,thanks
5714,"i think all this non-food related content needs to go to a second channel. more and more, this channel's content has little to do with food, recipes, food history, etc.

i really am not interested in debunking, ai, etc. i miss the cooking part of this channel."
5715,refreshingly excellent as always 
5719,"thank you so much, anne. this is crucial information and wisdom."
5721,"thank you for this video. of note, please never pay attention to josh hawley (republican senator from missouri); he's in the intro. he's a conspiracy theorist and partially responsible for the january 6 treason. he's the living embodiment of the misinformation machine you mentioned."
5722,"thank you for this very clear discussion. i am the wife of a sculptor and painter, and the mother and grandmother of artist from many mediums. this new source for stealing someone's work worries me."
5727,i love it! it helped me write code. i am not a coder
5729,brilliant summary of a complex topic. is that really you? or is it ai?!
5730,ai's will just make stuff up? ye gods.. so.. it's devolving into a politician?
5732,ai does not make us smarter. we are dumbing ourselves down
5735,ai generated images & audio steal from artists in so many ways. let's stand against that
5736,"great video, here is a question for thought, if an image or illustration is generated by ai and then retouched by a human (simple photoshop) is the image now able to be copy-written, if so then the need for talented graphic artists is moot as any entry level person could be taught to do simple retouch of images."
5744,apparently artists have seen their signatures turn up on ai art. that seems like a direct copy to me.
5745,"as someone who does applied ai research i can say that ann,  expectadly, did a great job without being too technical in her description. keep up the great work! "
5747,"this very morning, my optometrist and i had a similar conversation. his ai software is incredible but he said, in the end, he relies on his own judgment as it is too analytical at times and does not pick up nuances that a human automatically would. great video!"
5749,"0:40 googles ai being a problem isn't new. it's been a problem for a very long time, in fact since around 2016. it's ruined the youtube experience, and has been used for serious censorship and discrimination."
5750,"i don't think ai should be able to just make art, stories, posts and recipes which take away from the real professionals or pretend to be real people."
5751,"i kept waiting for the cooking tie-in...
seriously, i already watch several channels that are very knowledgeable in the field.  this comes across as a watered-down rehash by someone who doesn't know the field, but has just watched those other videos.
unless you have something to add,
or something that directly relates to your domain,
just don't."
5752,"males of pale skin is a good band name or,concerningly, political party"
5754,i’m hoping that ai will make it so that we can finally implement universal basic income
5757,when ai learns from 5 minute crafts....end of the world.
5759,"it also should be mentioned that this is not really ai, machine learning is just a more advanced stage of the predictive text from your cellphone."
5762,"ai is a program that dose actions but is still just a program which like all technology is only a tool to assist not replace or be like people, and should not be give control without human supervision or control over people, and should be able to be stopped at any time."
5769,"absolutely fantastic video!
thank you for doing this ann!"
5770,"i recently watched a news documentary concerning people using some type of system (possibly connected to ai?) to mimic the voice of an acquaintance or relative to scam money from, especially elderly, friends or family. some lost their life savings. you're right, ann, not everyone will use these things in honest ways."
5772,"please, do more videos like this, you know we love them "
5773,thanks for bringing up the very complicated issue of ethics and how the ai makes stuff up if it doesn't have an answer.
5774,i love your shirt!! where can i get it?
5777,i think as an artist if you don't want your art included in ai then don't put it in the public domain.
5780,i worry how ai will be used to scam everything.
5786,i love you! you are so sweet.
5787,"that’s for such an objective assessment. i make ai art for fun (it’s very therapeutic), and it’s bothered me how so many get upset about it without understanding the training process. your explanation of the copyright boundaries was excellent."
5789,i work in software for the courts. we had a case of a lawyer using chatgpt to write a brief and it sited a whole bunch of fake cases in a court we work with and now we are having to convince the courts that our software doesn’t use ai
5792,thank you ann for using your platform to educate!
5793,"i already saw video games that used ai art instead of human made art for their games as well as publishers who had book covers made by ai. it's bad and i am personally not okay with supporting it, it's just for them to save money. and also people who use ai to generate pictures or written text are not artists, even if they really want to be."
5794,"11:27 ""it's possible for the internet to be filled with so much misinformation that we don't know who we can trust any more""

sorry ann, we hit that point about 15 years ago without the need for ai."
5798,"i love and appreciate your voice of reason, always the steady person in the howling wilderness"
5799,elon ai roblot looks confused @ 17:46
5800,"i’m not particularly afraid of ai. it’s been around for years now, it’s useful and an integral part of our lives whether we like it or not.
the real problem, in my opinion, are those who misuse ai, to plagiarise, cut corners, etc.

there needs to be more critical thinking and objective information related to the topic, like this video."
5801,"as an artist who does freelance, there's already a ton of ai-generated artwork being sold online, flooding an already saturated market."
5804,"this episode brought to you by ""how to code that""

thanks ann"
5806,very interesting ann!!! thanks for sharing this information!
5810,"i don't think the ai is bad for misinformation.

i think humans enjoy using ai in that way tho...
bit like forgeries/misleading books written by ai, and put on amazon as part of a scam... humans misuse ai"
5811,this was so interesting. thank you for bringing us intelligent and thoughtful information.
5812,"does anyone else find it highly ironic that ai could, possibly, render the internet useless?  thanks, ann, for offering a clearly understandable explanation of where we stand with ai.  now (and i hate to say this because it sounds so sexist but...), can you please go back to the kitchen?  lol!  i miss your chocolate recipes and debunking videos."
5814,"i'm not sure if the threat of misinformation from ai means we'll need to be more critical of what we read; it just highlights how uncritical we already are.

as long as you have uncritical readers, misinformation is a threat no matter where it comes from."
5816,"there was a recent story of a lawyer who used ai to write his briefs, and chatgpt cited multiple cases that were completely fabricated.  he is now facing sanctions."
5819,"umm.....

why is everyone calling algorithms ai these days? 

they are not the same."
5829,thank you so much for the education you provide. i always get so excited when i see you've uploaded. you're a bloody legend
5830,"i assume that lady reading out the chatgpt response is an ai generated video?

i wonder if she looks like a real person."
5831,i don’t really see how ai training on other artists and writers is a huge problem. after all isn’t that how we train humans too? i bet there are millions of human artists who don’t have particularly unique styles
5837,"thank you
you and your videos are a treasure."
5840,a lawyer in new york recently submitted a brief to the court written by ai that cited completely made up cases as legal precedent. sanctions are pending.
5842,"this is good content, but i really do miss the cooking content."
5847,you manicure is mesmerizing here.  amazing 2-tone effect!
5848,chatgpt was not meant to be correct.  it's a language model.   think of it as writing a novel.   most people don't care if some of the facts are wrong as long as the story is good.
5852,"i love your work, but could the same thing not be said about every innovation that replaced a job? drake might need to find a new job? oh no! but a car factory cuts 90% of it workers because of machines, that’s not big news. it’s progress nobody likes it but they get used to it."
5853,but heres the real question... did she use ai to create that crazy intense edit at the start :0
5854,"most of these ai issues are only a problem because of capitalism. we should rejoice that computers can take over labor for us, but because we need to sell our labor in order to live, it's instead an existential threat."
5855,17:50 is that an ai generated elon musk in the audience?
5857,"there are few things that set my heart at ease more than a calm, thoughtful person saying intelligent, well-thought, and reasonable things about issues that matter. needless to say, i love ann reardon!"
5858,"ai is already politically bias

ai images are already being used to manipulate people 

ai are supposedly this “alien” species

ai will be the antichrist"
5860,"such an informative video thank you, love how you showed different artist styles,  want to do the same with my dog what prompts did you use to get the images? thanks so much "
5862,"reminder: concerns about job replacements are founded in capitalism, not ai."
5863,"as a writer, i'm so glad you brought up chatgbt because it feels like so many people never think of that one, like writing itself is a lesser art than the visuals."
5865,"@10:50 even tho this is clearly dangerous in many situations, i still find this quite funny, since thats what many humans do as well ;d. we sure taught ai lots of good and bad habits"
5867,oh boy would it be nice if we lived in an economic system where ai/automation benefited everybody instead of only people who use it to their own ends.
5868,"well done, ann!  what a clever way to illustrate your point.  thanks for making us aware of these concerns."
5869,humans have been captured by artificial intelligence since the renaissance.
5870,"i remember seeing someone do a 100 days drawing challenge and getting over 100k likes.. and its ai, a drawing challenge. and they wrote a prompt to get an ai image. that was so demotivating."
5871,i love that your channel has evolved to be a place to promote safe social conduct within the community! 
5872,commenting for the algorithm. everyone needs to see this. ai is terrifying
5874,theyre also using fanfiction which is a whole separate ai issue and copyright because its taking someone elses work and taking work they cant make money off of legally
5876,thank you for this much needed explanation!
5877,"ai should be automating jobs like hard, dangerous factory work. the problem is capitalism; people will lose those jobs, and may not be able to get ones for a different skillset, even if it is similar.

ai should not be automating art of any kind."
5879,my brother is part ai
5881,thanks for this clearly laid out video! i also think the energy and water usage of these ai programs is a huge issue.
5884,"this  a very accurate and well made video, nice contrast to the hype videos. wel informed and well researched."
5887,"in the world art, i have noticed that the people who are excited about ai are the ones who can't draw two straight lines and the ones who are worried are the ones who have spent years of their lives working on their skills"
5891,i  normally enjoy your videos but i t i ink you are underestimating a.i.
5893,i work for a banking and securities department in state government and have read articles about ai being incorporated into finance and replacing financial advisors.  ai makes crap up and i would not want it making pension decisions!
5896,you look great!
5897,"i've been dealing with job losses, copyright issues, and biases for almost 15 years. but those are from humans because most people don't value high end photography and most people actively hate trans women. so, ai doesn't worry me. if anything, society is just experiencing 1% of my daily life. you all deserve it"
5899,"ai being ""confidently incorrect"" is a recipe for misinformation
for real though, ""confidently incorrect"" is already a recipe for disaster"
5900,josh hawley talking about fair elections? that's rich.
5905,it is staggering to me that the person who is explaining ai in the most practical terms is a cooking instructor.  you are amazing.
5906,"i hope more people to see this video, as it explains a lot about the concerns on the topic in a very good way.
and, because yes, our world is filled with ill-content persons/entities, who would like to use ai for mayhem."
5909,"i saw a page on facebook dedicated to ai generated ""facts"" about animals, and i assume the intention was for it just be funny, but the comments would always reveal tons of people that didn't understand the information was false"
5917,"the way the ai know it is a coton de tulear is the same way i’d know about it, really.
i’m an artist and if you asked me “draw a coton de tulear”, first thing i’d do is to gloogle what the hell a “coton de tulear” means, which is pretty much what the ai did "
5918,"i absolutely love how anne just shares knowledge with us, she does so much research!"
5920,"not gonna lie, i'm shocked the second i saw that this channel, a cooking channel , bringing up the ai issue to the surface. on behalf of digital artists, thank you so much!"
5932,we had ai in software development for ages... it hasn't improved much tbh. coding is something very precise and the best ai can do is assist.
5938,we know we can trust that it’s truth if it comes from you ann  thank you for being amazing
5941,thank you for making this. there's so many misinformation around ai
5942,thank you so much for such an informative video! i love your content!
5943,"the only issue with ai models is how it is trained, other than that it's just another tool"
5945,one of the biggest problems currently is that people are using ai to make deepfake porn videos of public figures in order to blackmail them and demand money from them.
5948,"go figure, one of the most concise and informational videos for a layman on ai come from ann! how to cook that indeed.
thanks ann!!"
5949,that ai was more confident in an answer it just made up than i am with any answer. 
5951,"oh anne you are always amazing at explaining things. thank you for this video! i was only just talking to my family today about ai, and to be honest i was really concerned and scared of the subject. i definitely feel better and also feel like i have a much better understanding of it."
5954,i will give the ai one piece of credit... it can acknowledge when it messes up and it apologizes for doing so... that’s a lot more than most humans these days.
5957,i seen crimes made by ai either mimicking victims voices and making the  items pare to pay it's a scam
5959,"as a software developer i can say it could affect of jobs only of junior developers who write a software of the level of the ""hello world"" or something slightly more complex. if someone thinks that ai can generate a code based on a software requirements, it only meant that this person's never seen the real software requirement."
5961,no thank you. getting too lazy if you can’t even do your own work. i will stick to a admiring  real artist and real writers. ai is not an artist or a writer.
5963,love this channel! thanks making this video
5964,i feel like it will be dangerous one day if someone doesn't give the ai any limits. imagine if a hacker got access to the source code of any specific ai.
5966,"i appreciate that this video put all the information out there without misrepresenting anything or fear mongering. ai is still very much a developing field, and it is working its way into culture and society bit by bit. it's a good time to discuss these things."
5968,have you tried to get ai to do a debunking video in the style of ann reardon? 
5969,“if it doesn’t have an answer in its dataset it will just confidently make something up” —every customer service training ever
5970,hi ann.  i love your nail polish in this.  what is it?  (aware this isn't the point of the video but i love the nails all the same)
5971,i’ve played with ai writing programs before and it will go off the deep end if you don’t babysit it. every time i’ve had to change a lot of the lines to keep it coherent
5974,"i asked ai to describe a fart using poetry, was hilarious"
5976,"what's wrong with al? he's a great guy, loaned me a lawnmower one time."
5977,"what i am concern about ai art work or music is when it time to choose, human willing to choose thing make by ai  . =(((((("
5980,"""so i was reading this hilariously-bad ai-generated harry potter fanfic--"" ""what!? ai can write fanfiction now??"" ""uhh, yeah, just that random bits don't make sense and somehow darth vader shows up--"" ""skynet is upon us! flee! fleeee!!!"""
5981,"yes. we have been proven that artificial human intelligence is possible. apparently they make up lies now. thank you for investigating this, in a very researched way. if you were a science teacher,  i'd be very proud to have you as my grandchilds educator. greetings from dimboola, in victoria. you cover anything from aniseed to zoology.  a to z."
5982,thorough summary. thank you.
5983,i'm thinking a painter like vermeer.  i don't know if he ever painted a dog or other furry creature.
5984,"chatgpt is known to make up sources when asked to provide sources in a writing prompt. ai should be used as a tool, but like a tool it can't do all the work. the user has to do something as well."
5986,that ai video was a year ago!!!??? wow! time goes by so fast!
5987,"funny, when i was a kid, i used to imagine a world where robots and computers would take over the boring/dangerous/unfufilling duties so people would be free to create more art, more music, more books etc... and instead we have artists and creators worried that ai is going replace them."
5989,the jobs we need to erase are ceos. the position of ceo poisons your mind similar to hard drugs like cocaine or alcohol. ceos are too expensive and their decisions are only slightly better than a coin throw in the best of cases. 
5993,you know it must be bad when the wholesome cooking channel talking about ai 
5995,"probably the funniest and scariest thing i've read recently was a a new york attorney used chatgpt to help him find case law to bolster his client’s lawsuit, but the bot completely fabricated the cases. the lawyer got pulled into court to explain this to the judge."
5996,there is no copyright issue period. unless every upcoming artist browsing art books and taking inspiration from past artists is also infringing. still to have such good knowledge sharen on a cooking channel is quite extraordinary.
5997,"thank you for this video, i'm always glad when someone isn't just dismissing the concerns of creatives!"
5998,the costa rica parliament just presented a new project to regulate the use of ai but they actually used ai to generate the text for them 
5999,great video as always
6000,"the real plot twist would be if this whole video was ai scripted.  another great video, personally i'm excited to see how far ai can go. hopefully it stops before becoming skynet."
6003,ai terrifies me.  people will abuse it.  this cannot end well.
6004,"apparently a lot of ai is getting trained by fanfiction websites (such as ao3) for writing. seen a lot about it going around on tiktok, you can tell it to write fanfiction and it does. very odd."
6006,"the debate about art and ai really irks me. artists train on other artists and then uses a pen/brush. a newer artist can also train on artists and then use ai. ai on its own isn't doing anything, it is just a tool. similar protests were in place for the beginnings of trains and cameras and they were just as silly."
6007,"ai tools are great. as a tool. it's not a complete replacement. that said, some tasks that required multiple people may only need one person now."
6008,"i never realized how big the issue was - really only heard about ai for art, and since art students frequently copy the masters to learn techniques, didn't think much of it. thanks for such a detailed, broad exploration of the issues with ai use."
6012,they just straight up steal images which isnt right either. ive seen systems where you put in a prompt and it will build an image but those images are made up of actual artists work manipulated but still recognisable. its straight up plagiarism really. other artists are profiting of selling ai based designs.... that have come from other artists!
6013,"there are also scientific articles being put out that were written with ai, and stupid me losing sleep over writing a good discussion "
6014,"why are we so afraid of jobs being taken, we have an aging population meaning less people will need to support more elderly - we need to reduce manpower and become more effective otherwise how will we survive in old age.

the bigger worry is will it only be for the wealthy while elderly poor people are left out"
6015,for whatever reason i’m already over ai art. i think i liked linkin parks ‘lost’ video and that was kinda it for me.
6016,"automation in a capitalist world = dystopia
automation in a socialist world = utopia
we're only afraid of ai and automation because it mean we'll end jobless, then homeless, while the top 1% being even richer than ever."
6017,"i asked chat gpt about the small urban street i live in in kent, u.k. it told me it’s famous for its amazing architecture and great shopping and restaurants. umm no it’s an ordinary street of terraced houses"
6018,i'd rather gave an ai as a friend
6020,"a couple of lawyers in the us are on the verge of being disbarred because the junior lawyer used chatgpt to write a legal document in which the ai _invented_ a bunch of legal cases in support of the plaintiff. neither the senior lawyer nor the junior lawyer checked the cases to ensure they were real, but the defendant's lawyers certainly did."
6024,philip defranco said it best; ai is currently the worst it will ever be.
6029,"as an artist, writer, and software developer, i am very happy to see this dialogue about ai"
6031,every time you have to verify you are not a robot by clicking on pictures. that is ai traning
6032,"ai is bad. period.
bad for every component of human (and animal) life. 
it's going to be used to control us. ís already being used to control us."
6033,"this was a really clear introduction to ai for the non-tech-minded, thanks "
6034,it doesn’t seems like ai learning from peoples work is different from how artists learn.
6036,"so now you are also ai specialist competent enough to lecture us on it. eh, youtube is such a good place for dunning-kruger effect to blossom, i guess all those views and followers really get to content creators head."
6037,"very interesting and concerning. now, can ai fix the stupid jerky movements that have been happening on youtube videos for the past two weeks or so?"
6039,"as a not ai we believe that you shouldn ́t be scared of meit... just keep up the awesome job as human, which we are definitely. 
who freed this woman from the kitchen? ... am i wright, pale male brother. ha ha ha ..."
6041,"until they invent an ai that can waste time on youtube, my job is safe."
6046,love this video! keep it up!
6050,im trying to stay away from ai. i know its not true ai and its just using a learning algorithm but ive seen so much bad from it already
6053,"artists shouldnt need to be compensated for the training, as they arent compensated for ""training"" other human artists.
however, they should receive royalties for any published works using their style, same as if you had used their work within your own."
6054,the first thing to know about ai is that it is limited by the intelligence and motives of the people who programmed it and trained it. it lies also.
6057,"i hope that you will come to egypt so that i can let you go everywhere in egypt and enjoy seeing you, my teacher"
6059,"ai training on ai is actually only a problem for the company who runs the ai. what happens is basically inbreeding, you end up with a product that is completely nonsensical."
6060,lol good thing russian people used to not consider most of commenters human cause of massive propaganda :d
6061,"also one of the concerns is the whole using ai to grab photos of women and put them in pornographic videos, it's disgusting and so violating"
6063,"i didn't expect a cooking channel to speak on ai, but i already liked the video as soon as it started because i know you always do the research and amazing work covering topics that are not necessarily directly related to cooking."
6064,"wait, the internet isn't already full of misinformation? "
6065,the amount of people i’ve seen online using the chat ai thing for writing anime role-play porn is kind of disturbing. like a disturbing amount.
6066,"maybe you should have two channels. i like this content, its very interesting, well researched and tested like everything you do, but it’s not very cooking related."
6067,as an ai researcher i'm impressed at how thoroughly and concisely you summed up all the problems with the current ways ai is being commercialized
6068,rip illustrators and painters. thank you for your service.
6069,"this video gives me ""idiocracy"" (2006 film) vibs. someday, no one will be able to draw, program, or diagnose without the help of an ai. there will be no reason to lern because everytink will be done by the ai. sounds like a sad future to me.

well, at least ""idiocracy"" is a funny movie. 
"
6070,i am surprised you didn't mention the ai cake trend.. cake bakers are being bombarded with impossible  cake requests.. sending pics of a cake that never existed!
6075,"i'm a teacher and so many teachers i know use chatgtp to make their lesson plans. while i'm all for doing things to make the job easier, i wonder how long will it be until ai is better at planning and resource making that teachers are no longer needed, but rather just a supervisor to watch the students, while ai teaches the class..."
6076,logical voice n these weird times.  thank you.
6080,"already in the publishing world, i've seen graphic designers and artists be pushed to the side in favor of ai-generated covers, both in indies and even large, traditional publishers like tor. a lot of creatives are fearing for their livelihoods right now."
6082,"i wonder how would they be able to make ai smarter than humans since it depends on information granted by humans for it to function, it can not invent anything new neither have original ideas, just displays a mix of different data"
6083,"great explainer! and, much like the cake recipe, the stephen king fake bears little resemblance to the actual writing style. that's encouraging, so far, until it learns.."
6085,"“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”
― frank herbert, dune (1965)"
6086,this response was generated by ai <3
6089,humans are just ai with slightly more inputs and outputs than current ai. and also with the absolute certainty of their own superiority.
6090,thank you for this info. fascinating!
6093,"if you become an ""ai artist"" where you work with ai to create the images needed, you should be able to copyright them. it's not a random image. you put in work to come up with that exact image. there are artists who use a paint can on a rope or similar hands off approach and they are making ""real art""."
6094,"you might be interested in an interview by ""conversations with a calvinist"" on transhumanist movement :) thanks for your content!"
6095,"this was terrific!  very enlightening - so much to think about.  thank you.  (one point:  i can't speak for the stephen king, but neither the blyton nor the seuss pastiche was much chop - which i guess shows an interesting limitation - so far.)"
6098,the video hasn't started yet and i already know it's good
6099,the copyright part is very very interesting
6100,i'm so glad i watched this.  thank you ann.
6106,good talk. should’ve combine stephen king and dr. seuss. lol 
6108,"my mom was a journalist and she would edit articles that ai made. she said there would be so
many mistakes! whats the point of having an ai write if it doesnt even make your job easier  great video!!"
6109,amazing to see your evolution from  cooking channel. your research on this complex topic and the way you explain it to be simple and easy to understand is outstanding
6110,"good stuff! another youtuber named rosanna pansino just tried making a cake using a recipe generated by ai... it turned out horribly, as she fought her urge to change things up that she knew weren't going to work properly, realizing that most people wouldn't know it wasn't going to work."
6111,"thanks for the comprehensive ai overview! it's both great for people with little previous knowledge, and for people who understand how the technology works but don't know all ethical consequences."
6113,"oh my gosh, the internet flooded with misinformation. how would we cope? oh wait..."
6116,"i was just thinking about it today and boom here is ann's video, a perfect timing! thank you for cralifying those issues in a simple and understandable way. i love watching your videos!"
6117,i was hoping to become a graphic design artist and maybe go to school for it especially after spending my middle school and high school years doing nothing but drawing. all for that to basically be thrown in the trash thanks to ai
6118,"a.i = astronomically intelligent; 
& quite f**king scary."
6120,"i’m a pharmacist and ai has been a huge topic in my field but when they applied it it had many issues and they came to the conclusion that we, real pharmacists are more cost-effective than ai"
6121,"you know, for a food scientist, you are equally a scientist of many other topics. thanks for sharing your thorough research! i learned so much!"
6122,i love how this channel went from “here’s how you can make a fun cake lol” to big time social commentary
6123,"5 minute crafts out there poisoning the ai’s datasets on food. 
(also, ai has the issue of its carbon footprint.)"
6126,well you know for a fact ai will not replace ann
6127,"""persuasive lies"" sounds like a good start for new world order..."
6129,"i didn't know i wanted your take on ai, but i'm here for it. personally, i feel pretty confident that my job is ai-proof. i do with many older people or others who are potentially vulnerable. they want a human to help them and i don't see that changing, plus my company makes it clear we're pro-human."
6131,"ann you're a cyberpunk hero, fighting against corporations. thank you a lot!"
6132,ask the ai to write a story in its own style....
6134,"don't worry, guys. people have been conned all throughout the history of life, ai will not make any significant difference."
6135,"only physical robots could take over my job, but ai on a computer no"
6136,"funny that when computers become more human, they make more mistakes - human error is no longer just a thing humans make, but also machines."
6137,cool
6139,"ai made this video, didn't it? didn't it!?!?!"
6141,"if you release your works to the public is it released, you have no creator control of who views that work including ai"
6144,"oh we are already there. the powers that be are just releasing civilian-grade ai. the military grade ai has been around for a while. you just can’t recognize it. for example, many of your favorite influencers are ai. youtube comments and users are filled with ai & deepfakes."
6146,"i've noticed more and more people using ai to sell fake art, and the mom and pops running those cutesy local dog groups on facebook etc don't have the experience to look out for it or the ability to recognize it."
6149,"omg this was a great and funny video ann, more ai content i say lol. call out the ai lies :p 

love ya!"
6153,"chinese and korean game companies recently started using ai art instead of hiring human artists. it happened en masse, a ton of people lost their jobs and are now unemployed, unable to find a job again in the industry.
the struggle against the graphic artists is more than real. it is happening as we speak."
6154,"as a developer who utilises ai in their job, i can say that ai is not at all ready for writing code  more than small snippets of the most rudimentary code.

it is a great tool for discussing problems, though! more of an interactive documentation and a tireless conversationist"
6163,"i hope you're not ai generated, ann also, your pup is just amazing"
6165,"i actually used chatgpt to apply for jobs i was previously rejected for, i was quickly invited for interviews using it.... sadly chatgpt cant do the interview for me and i flopped.
maybe ai should have my job."
6166,"great video, i have been keeping up-to-date with all the ai information, but this video was so helpful to be able to share with friends and family, who are a little bit less informed on the topic. you covered such a great range."
6168,"i would never question your intelligence ma'am, but i am so shocked you have such through understanding and making such a great informative, educative video and kept it simple. 
i have seen so many tech bros spewing garbage and here you are making such a great video. love your work"
6169,"to be clear “we’re not there yet” regarding super human or human-like ai is the understatement of the century.
we are nowhere near even beginning to crack that nut, and it’s  completely different from something like large language models such as chatgpt."
6171,would it be that bad if ai could replace some jobs were human make a lot of mistakes? i mean how many times doctors misdiagnosed ? if we can habe a 100% accurate machine to diagnose us wouldn't it be better?
6172,"nobody with a brain is worried about the copyright. all art is derivative, that one complaint is pointless."
6174,"honeslty, people losing jobs due to technological advancement happened all the time through whole human history, especially in last 200 years. ai is just another one of thoose, and it will happen again with any sighinificant breakthrough in science and technology."
6175,"ai will evolve, subjugate us and send von neumann probes to consume the universe, or just help us all to do our day to day jobs better. i for one welcome our new ai overlords."
6176,"huge fan of your channel, not many youtubers are real with their audience. also i like when you involve your family, it’s cute and wholesome! thanks!"
6177,ai cheapens talent and mocks it at the same time. this won't end well! down with ai!
6179,thank you!
6181,"as with everything you do, this was presented succinctly, clearly, and intelligently. i enjoy your channel so much, ann. thanks for this."
6183,i don't know if ai super intelligence will ever be possible because human error is also going to be somewhat at the root
6186,"anyone else get distracted by anns color changing nails?  
theyre so pretty"
6188,this is a great summary of the discourse about ai
6191,ai should be a tool not a substitute for anything
6192,"how about we ask the military on what their opinion on ai is,
""nanomachine son""
ugh, the dystopians futuristic reality of mgs revengeance is really making me want to use time travel and granfather clock paradox the crap out of this nonsense"
6193,"all artists are trained in just the same way as ai. it just does it faster. does anyone claim copyright due to the inspiration, conscious or otherwise, that will have influenced the artist? as for compensation...."
6196,ai bad you're a good person
6197,snapchat ai is convinced that queen elizabeth is still alive haha
6200,i recall the one on twitter a few years back.... the humans were successful in making it awful
6201,"ai is a double-edged sword. yes it can be beneficial in the right hands. but we also know it can be devastating in the wrong hands. and we all know there's going to be ""that guy""."
6202,will ai affect the cooking/pastry industry or is that safe
6206,"just so everyone knows, companies will boast they are using ai when they just are using an algorithm because ai is what's popular, true ai is much more complicated."
6207,"its so unnerving going on artstation knowing that by default every post is used to train ai. because theyre using an opt out system for every individual post, any old posts  that haven't been tagged are able to be added to datasets."
6208,"the ai are also quite racist because it can learn from humanities history. 
the acceptance and equality movement is a relatively new movement, and its history pales in comparison to the hundreds of years of eurocentric/racist written history"
6211,it's great having anne always being the calm voice of reason in a sea if craziness. she is always so thorough and sensible
6213,wow it was such a detailed analysis of the entire thing. thanks ann!
6216,"i can hear the people who create the ai right now complaining and trying to convince everyone
""we are feeding it the human culture so that it can understand humanity and work with humanity""
or some kind of absolutely bland meaningless platitude avoid of any actual meaningful logic."
6218,"cockily lie? ais are politicians , or scammers at least"
6219,"we humans are just like ai, i think we will raise it till maturity one way or another.
every song will be written, every piece of art created in a very short period of time, just pick out the gems. what a time to be alive, such a shake up."
6220,"i’m not afraid of ai, i’m afraid of who is programming it or feeding it."
6221,"i wonder if ai might be the death of the internet. just listening to this makes me want to further distance myself from it.

also, i think we all know what sort of biases the ai has."
6222,i think that it’s a very complicated topic. scary and fascinating.
6223,"there is actually another concern over ai. people becoming attracted to chat ai romantically. yes this is actually a thing. so if enough people fall into that trap, it will be affecting social interactions in the coming generations. at least if this becomes normal."
6224,i always look foward to your videos thank you ann 
6225,"they'll take over millions of jobs. millions will be out of work. no money, no food, housing, etc. people will fight over scraps of food.
then, with all the ai's, the misinformation, somehow, the internet will crash.
we might be set back to the days of laura ingalls wilder and have to start again.
that's just my theory though."
6230,"i'm an artist. ever since the issue of ai taking over the art community with ai it has been bugging me. lots of people seem to hv different opinions on it but for me, it's disrespectful when artists work hard to produce a piece but then ai takes the credit when they're only mixing lots of people art works to make it theirs"
6231,amazing video as always ann  
6233,it will create new jobs: editors. humans will have to make sure the ai doesn't spew bs.
6234,"noithng wrong with less jobs just means that the society can function with less strain on the workforce, government should be using it to their advantage and meaning that peoples needs are met without slaving at work. people can spend more of their time doing things they enjoy and spending time with their loved ones, not a bad thing."
6244,sure. i saw many people very happy to contribute more data to ai.
6245,did you try asking ai to make a king george eating a snowball shaped dessert without making george look like a snow ball? 
6246,"well done ann, fantastic, detailed deep-dive into a hot topic!!"
6247,can you try another ai generated recipe to compare whether it has improved from last year?
6248,amazing video  ann
6260,"as someone who might be replaced by a robot at work in the near future, this ai is starting to scare me"
6261,love the quality of your vidoes - so informative and well made! thank you for putting all that effort into your work
6263,"my first experience with ""ai"" was a chatbot named smarterchild. that was in the early 2000s. it was so groundbreaking at the time that my siblings and i had to convince my parents that it was an actual computer and not some weirdo who liked talking to kids. "
6264,"from what i have seen, it's effectiving shall artist on twitter a lot. some of them are losing a lot of their supporter because of ai."
6265,how do we know that you aren't an ai ann reardon?
6266,this is spot on! a great summary of ai from what i think is a fair and informed point of view.
6267,the topic of ai is seriously becoming a huge anxiety trigger for me - it seems so stupidly impossible to stop “progress” when there’s a profit to be made  i have to hope that more sanctions and guidelines will eventually be added. i have to hope for something.
6268,"honestly, i think people are giving ai too much power."
6269,plot twist: ai generates a company and calls it skynet...
6272,your awesome love your videos 
6278,so basically... is there anything good out of it or is it another nuclear bomb-type of invention? it seems to be the latter...
6279,to get interesting and well presented thoughts on high tech subjects i always go to a cooking channel.  who wouldn't.  nicely done ann.
6280,us airforce did a virtual trial of ai controlling a drone. it wanted to attack the human controller so it could get its target faster. when told not to attack the controller it wanted to attack the communications tower so the human couldn't tell it what to do
6282,"they've already shown it's politically left leaning bias, which means our division is just going to get worse!
regardless, i sincerely appreciate you bringing the questions most people have never even considered, into the conversation they didn't even know, they need to have. 4  always"
6284,"excellent video, really makes you wonder what the future is going to look like."
6286,this is not ai in the essence of artificial intelligence. “today’s” ai is imply program that needs to be given input to make output.  due to this most jobs will probably move to error checking.  actual ai is sentient where can learn from gathering it’s own input - this is when the real worry should set in.
6287,"if we can create something more intelligent than us, you don't need to have an iq of 250 just to understand that you are creating a monster. i believe that god limited the human intellect for certain reasons."
6289,"i'm a designer - we are not allowed to use ai. i really don't see the point of an automated system, especially when the human race is expanding at such a rapid rate. thank you for all the information. i wouldn't like my artwork to be plagiarised by ai"
6290,awesome! new video!!!!!!
6292,"as a writer and avid reader of stephen king and dr seuss etc... it does sort of imitate the style, but in a very, very simplistic way. it doesn't sound great. it's using the facts and trying to add the atmosphere, but does not actually write with any distinctive 'style' if you know what i mean..."
6293,amazing job as always mum.  your research & editing was epic on this one
6294,"when i saw this video title i worried for a moment, especially having seen some creators i wouldn't have expected getting really on board with ai and chatgpt uncritically. don't know why i worried though, this was a really thorough well-rounded video!"
6296,good luck to the ai who s gonna steal my job as a hairdresser 
6297,"i keep having to rewind because your manicure is positively mesmerizing daaaahling! my screen settings could be off but i see a gorgeous color shift of mid tone beige/lavender...???? dunno if i’m describing it correctly but it’s loverly and i would love to try it on my nails!!
"
6298,im sorry but a cooking youtube channel shouldn't be putting out a video on ai.
6300,"i've found on youtube people making tutorials ""how to make and sell ai art"".
this thing should be illegal. people who have no talent/artistic skill should not be allowed to make money selling ai ""art"".
we can't stop ai, but images generated by it should be free. so nobody profits from them.

i hate the world i'm living in..... "
6301,"i've been wanting to get in touch about this as a couple of weeks ago i saw an article from the mirror which is a uk newspaper saying that a great way to poach eggs is to put them in the microwave. i was like omg, no!! i can't believe actual newspapers are promoting this dangerous thing and saying that it's a good thing to do. "
6302,"a very well-informed video. as an undergraduate of eee, i think people are over concern about the existence of ai and it is true that it is trained with what we currently had in terms of data. the main concern of it is still back to humanity on how an ai will be trained and used. greed can be the downfall of all of these."
6303,"it would be cool to get an update on the ai recipe video, since it seems like newer ai models are getting pretty good at generating them"
6304,"okay, little bit worried about ai right now ... but that thumbnail is hilariously weird!"
6306,"its true that ai will take over some jobs but i believe it will also create new jobs. i remember watching years ago ""desk set"" from 1956 with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy, its about machiene learning and trying to take over libratians jobs and ultimately failing. it was a fun movie but seeing how ai evolved its kinda scary now."
6308,i can tell u already that it uses google images to get trained.
6309,"the bit about ai just making stuff up to fill the gaps in it's lack of a clear choice to answer a question...  made me think that governments and corporations are already using it for most of their correspondence,  yeah it's a cheap jab but what the the hell.."
6311,"thanks, ann"
6312,racist and misogynistic ai. love it
6314,well on the copyright issue why aren't we asking the same questions of humans? i am a designer among other things and one of the first things i do when creating a new design is to look at other designs for inspiration.... inst that the same as ai training? do i owe people money for that?  though if i press play again you essentially covered that ;)
6315,"this is great editing, great job ann! it's great your showing awareness for this topic."
6317,"not sure how to cook that, but interesting as always :)"
6318,now your grandkids can make fun of you for not knowing how to use the ai robot. come on grandpa it easy!
6319,thank you for a fascinating video!! suddenly really glad to be a physio!! 
6320,this one of best ai explain video. wow. very explanatory and informative.
6321,"ever since your video on fractal wood burning popped up on my feed i've been so enthralled with your videos. thank you for fitting educational content around charming baking videos, it really is an amazing combo "
6322,chatgpt is the best gaslighter i know.
6323,"finally, someone explains the ai situation properly and in concise unbiased manner.

though on the ai lying, i don't see how that is any worse than ""entrepreneurs"" blatantly lying to potential investors or people making up false articles for their political agendas. it seems those people are pretty alarmed that ai can lie better than them."
6328,"if you're bourgeoisie, ai is amazing. you spend far less on labour which means you get more in profits.

of course, if all jobs are automated, people wouldn't be able to buy your product"
6330,"i think a.i. could do a lot of good, if people stopped giving it to much power. but we all know they think the question isn't why but why not..."
6335,"if i want to understand something, i need to hear it from ann. you have such great communication and teaching skills."
6340,plot twist: this video was created by an ai replica of anne reardon
6344,"i'm impressed by your broad knowledge, and am glad that you use your platform not only for delicious chocolate desserts, but also to debunk 5-minute crafts and a broad spectrum of other things on the internet, instead of just ""going for the click""."
6346,"if we just ban generative ai, then the problem would be solved. right?"
6348,it's a good day when ann posts
6349,i love your videos!!! thank u for this
6350,"who's written work was used to train any human? does it not influence your future work, doesn't matter how original your work will be, it will still be inspired from previous works and your own experiences? does seem to be a lot of fear mongering."
6353,oh wow- i have the amazing honor of being the 165th liker to this video! keep it up!
6354,amazing video. those photos of molly were pretty incredible too!!
6355,hi ann! i really appreciate the amount of work you are putting in to every single video you make! you have inspired me to become a dietitian and now i’m studying in unsw— doing a course you introduced to me! thank you so much keep on going!
6356,im only 16 but i absolutely love your videos ann keep up the awesome work! a lot of my friends think i’m weird for watching them lol but i find them so calmly and i always learn something new so thank you <3
6357,i loved this kind of videos. i became the person who makes my day more beautiful 
6358,"i think ai should be seriously controlled and restricted so it can only use artistic content that the creators allow to be used, and it should never be able to be used for creative stuff for publication, only for fun."
6359,yay this just made my day 
6360,hey ann! love your work !
6362,ai just like cooking. u need ingredients to serve a food. it a same as ai. u need input to get output u need. only workload will be created 
6364,the recent analysis videos have been really interesting.
6365,"hands up to ann for being one of the best content creators out there. the way she tackles all of these real life topics and makes them educational and entertaining is fantastic. i love how much her channel has grown over the years, she’s truly amazing."
6366,"thank you for the video 
so informative as always "
6367,rant : it's not bloody ai !!!! it's machine learning !!! there are no sentient machines out there
6368,"funny thing, i was just talking about this yesterday!!! very interesting topic, needed this information. thank you!
5.35am and can't sleep again, second time i've caught a htct as it hits "
6369,"yes!! very true, local artist here raises protest about this, and slowly but surely, how about call center agents replaced with ai robots?? and super agree with job loss  ohh what's happening to the world now.."
6370,"i really just want to thank ann for educating me for so long, i started watching you when i was in yr 8 now im halfway through year 11 and i haven't missed any of your uploads since then.

thank you "
6371,"everyone all ""is ai going to take over our jobs???"" but i haven't had any of the ""i"" of ""ai"" ever in my life and i've been surviving so like, checkmate machines?"
6372,ah ai. i'm seeing detroit become human becoming real. either way i love how i never know what to expect from your channel. i love the variety. i'll see you again on friday!
6373,hello ann! i sent you a message on coffee a while back and was wondering if you could possibly do a video explaining dagnola coffee?
6374,"before going into the video
no ai can replace the trust we have in your video."
6377,"ai will likely be used as leverage against workers to extract even more profit from them. we will probably have to do more work for the same pay. otherwise, it could be a means to help us do less work and enjoy our lives more."
6378,love your videos ann. 
6379,waiting since a long time... love from india
6380,always here for ann and her intelligence
6381,"to hell with ai shit!  seriously, did terminator teach us nothing?"
6382,"ai to me isn’t a deficit of jobs but faster task management to make jobs easier, but i get why it’s generally disliked rn "
6383,"very nice coverage of this topic, really great work. thanks ann!"
6384,"ann, no one does anything more perfect than you. btw: your curly hair just keeps getting cuter and cuter."
6387,yay i'm here early again!
6389,hooray! a new upload :d
