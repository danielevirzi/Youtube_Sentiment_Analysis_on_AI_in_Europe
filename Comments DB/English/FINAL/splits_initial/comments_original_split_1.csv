 about boys t-levels bud how you gonna explain that one away? and no kids are not smarter today not even close they are all mush heads
 we go mr i raise my kids right… but then you meet them and they are stupid no mannered clowns
 we go another superior parent lol if you say so pal
"​ course school is dumbing them down.
most parents work all the time now governement has done a fantastic job of separating the family unit. actually do some research you'll probably have a rude awakening"
 could you please provide some materials for this research? i'm really intersted on the matter and would love a suggestion if possible
" that’s not just a human thing,that’s a mammal thing. animals such as dogs,cats,wild animals have that same ability. i will agree that a machine such as ai will not have that ability. wasn’t this discussed in terminator 2 when at the end when they lowered arnold into the liquid metal."
@jona7fer  i'm ok thanks.  but thanks for the threats and attempted extortion.
 i was a good parent and my daughter writes novels and she married a man who writes code
*i was freaked out about ai when i was 12 i was reading through transcripts from think tank meetings in the 1950s where they first discussed the pros & cons of ai & robotics. i've been freaked out since that weekend.*
"true. us the parents have a very hard work to provide the best education for our children. best schools is not enought, we must have the most active role in education at home."
"teach your kids critical thinking and real world skills.  this ai system will create even lazier people.  look how gps has changed things, and cell phones. i’m just as guilty not remembering phone numbers anymore. or having my eyes glued to directions."
well they're not building them to do the jobs of other robots!!
much of that comes down to parents. far too often they treat schools as daycare and teachers as babysitters. learning and love of learning start at home.
he'll yeah somebody said it god bless you. maks a computer smarter than are the children thats pretty jacked up. a .i is evil.
 good for you and your family. god bless you and yours
education system is being changed to better paedophilia in the future and prevent jail sentences ​
transformers -- ai in disguise!
"yes, humanity has committed suicide.
the dumbassery is unbelievable everywhere now!"
"this whole video is so misleading. 
beaause this below video explained it brilliantly how chatgpt works. 
a summary of google paper and spotify cto's talk: https://youtu.be/gt6lxw70k28?si=cifi6r4fykawgufq"
that's what machines do
studies have shown that boomers were dumber than any of the current generations due to the amount of lead in the air.
" no, your video is misleading to trust ai."
most interesting point
​-liferemove ai while you're at it let them find things on the internet the old way.
an ai world does not need your children in it. get it?
yours maybe mine just got a degree .... in ai :-)
"our digital prisons await. 
digital is pure fiat…
no cost fake track and trace currency. the surveillance state and real time censorship and data manipulation. theyre weaponizing the woke. when trump gets elected because that will
unhinge the left the globalists and their false flags will run unabated"
that's the parents fault. my kids are incredibly smart and way ahead of other kids their age
 congratulations mine too
 no they're not. you're too easily impressed.
 yeah ok wow thanks for the information. you are really smart to know what others think. i'm impressed...
  you're too easily impressed.
how is it a surprise if you give an ai unlimited access to knowledge and stupidity via internet that it learns things?
"ai can reverse the dumbing down, caused by the system."
great point!
"children  like adults  can learn  what they want to over and above normal  school experience. the information  is there. to learn  way more than school  could  possibly  give you strong  advantages  over most kids , my own was one of those, she is no longer with us but she left a major impression  on her class mates"
"​-pi4jryou mean the people who built the internet and the technological revolution? amazon,  microsoft,  and apple are all boomers. who opened china and raised the whole planets wealth by astronomical numbers in decades, the counter-culture and civil rights movements including health?

no one is allowed to hate the boomers except gen x."
​ your brain is failing you then. ​
greed through technology will ultimately do us all in but it will be because of humans.  ai will not be a threat unless humans make it a threat.
that could be good news.  maybe ai will be able to replace those ungrateful little brats.
"fluoride in water and toothpaste, laundry detergent, social media, short attention spans because of technology, diet/growth hormones, declining testosterone levels because of food/products, lack of spirituality, not enough meditation, air quality... i could go on but my amygdala is on fire."
"nice try, children were already stupid."
this is such an accurate & very scary post. nicely summed up daniel!
it's mainly the parents allowing their children to use alexa and google voice that enables their inability to learn how to read and write. the amount of illiterate children today surpasses every generation in the past 70 years.
"oh well, the parents are responsible. but parents love to throw their responsibility at the school and the government. good point tho. i nkow you have 514 other people answering on this, but yea. i think it's highly debateble. i don't even know why you have so many likes lol. the like people should be fkn ashamed. probably all singles tbh lol"
"well in the future with the brainchips we dont really have to think , we just know everything automaticly :d"
make everyone stupid and reliant on technology so they'll be useless babies. the people controlling the world want to retain their power forever so yea
" nope not mine and i hope not yours but there are a lot of people in the united states of america. do you think that low test scores all over america is good?
if so please defend your stand."
" i don't think low test scores are good. i also don't think america should be a measurment for the state of society. if you think otherwise, please defend your stand."
do you not think the american children are being dumb down? i've seen many videos where they asked people what country the great wall of china is in? and obvious questions like that and they can't figure it out because they're not being taught critical thinking like the ai is apparently learning
the sad thing is most people don't understand the value of work for their brains and bodies. this is why they indirectly empower tech synonyms to subtly.apply satanic techniques to ruin their offsprings (meaning so subtle that most people see it even as an empowerment )
 probably didn't know more but certainly understood more. this were the times when they did set theory in primary school. the times where kids learned real reasoning. this empowered them to understand the most by knowing the least. so needing only a few basic facts and derive the remaining things they needed.
 their attitude might be stupid but certainly not their iqs
"it'll be idiocracy with machines doing everything for us and we will be all to daft to know how to turn them off, lower iqs per generation due to higher iqs opting not to have kids"
", it’s why home schooled kids are usually way smarter but super socially awkward"
"ai does not exist, hype is only about improvement in software."
"and programmed! when a 40 something teacher , told my grandson,  that obama is the greatest president of all time. i knew we was in trouble! he has been shown the truth... and he's a normal american loving young man now"
ai ain't learning shit. they already been dumbed down by the educational system that they have installed!
"who the fuck would want artificial intelligence? how about the real fucking deal. i want real intelligence, not fake shit man. i'm not 17"
"it is inevitable that ai will be the decision maker for many things, cause most ppl will be too dumbed down to oppose. what a glorious future."
"human beings got wind…ai getting wind…. just gonna take a little longer to get “ who monkey hand off the wrench “
lmaoff!! having fun with this menagerie as always brother "
"and that's no one's fault but the ones raising the children. regardless of standardized learning, you can teach your child the necessary information. you just let your own busy schedule get in the way of that. therefore, if your child turns out dumb, you didn't do your job as a parent. stop blaming systems for your shortcomings."
"aways thought the biggest down fall from ai tech is the process of thinking ""hey everybody lets create something that thinks instead of us"" far scarier and far more real than terminator scenario"
"while western schools are still grappling with gender studies and what defined a woman, schools in the asian countries are pursuing aggressively ai technologies and students are taught from a very young age on all the ai concepts. incredible"
don't need crazy ai to figure this one out. i coulda told you that one years ago.
"nofx: the idiots are taking over.
once i thought it was a song performed by a rock band, but now i know its a broadcast of current affairs."
​-wu1xdmy sisters kids were homeschooled. the kids are awesome. i think it depends on the parent
children being dumbed down no thanks to ai but to humanity.
​@andrew-wu1xd you can thank the parents for that
"if your children are being dumbed down, then that's your fault. you should be supervising their education. but i agree, humans are definitely getting dumber."
bro i had not even thought about that but they are doing it right in front of us and we just walk around like it’s all cool lol
"don't worry, won't be long until ai's replace most teachers. think about it-a customized teacher for each student. infinitely patient, smart, always available, and above all, cheap!"
"if we are ais enemy   the only hope is the magnetic pole shift. it happens every 800,000 years, but is 200,000 years late. do you know what that means? noah's ark was a million years ago."
our kids are being trained to rely on ai. that is concerning.
"​ no, the politics have been to constantly say ""education"" during all campaigns while creating curriculum that is void of critical thinking, steady standards of achievement, and real history. the system creates people that are unable to seriously question the claims from the establishment."
yeah because when the robot overlords take over only smart children will be able to stop them
good point
when your pc refuses to shutdown  or drain your bank account. basically all your resources are online. so one day ai can use it to get its way should it become self-aware. it might be already here. the force driving people to gain more ways of improving the system is influenced by ai.
 with ai they could steal all the money out of a safe and have ai make a video of you robbing the safe. turn the video into the police and laugh all the way to vegas.
  people who control the ai. that’s already happening. which is why there’s a lot of self checkouts at the grocery stores shutting down.
"to insurer, ai future success and dependence on and use , the best way would be dumb down the population"
"hey, ai, build me the ironman suit!!  hey, ai, build me the star trek warp engine!!   i love it!!  hurry up ai,  lets get the ball rolling!!"
"i am not afraid of the ai built by usa.   but, i am afraid of ai currently being built by china and even russia.  they have no limits and no laws to prevent ai from becoming too powerful."
 have you signed up to get an elon musk brain chip yet?
 even if you do have laws how do you enforce them against  rouge robots?
every generation claims the young are getting less knowledgeable..
"​
wow!"
-life you are a cog in the machine
"our children have been being dumbed down for years, way before ai, the whole idea of common core was the start of it!"
" you’re talkin’. not just tell you how; we already know how. buy low, sell high. but could ai actually pick the right stocks, & other investments?"
so keep them home from the joke we call school and give them ai trainers 24/7 for whatever interests them. ai can even test them to see what their best skill sets are.
not only in schools but an incredible rise in autism. it’s so much easier for an autistic person to follow orders.
"-ii7gy1rw5w yes, on purpose. you will own nothing and be happy you will eat bugs instead of meat. klaus schwab. 
i bet klaus schwab won't be eating bugs he will be eating the best meat on the planet."
don’t think it’s just the children. all of us are... robots replacing jobs... important jobs... and if ai disappears or goes offline how we going to have people who know how to run things?
"""you can be the biggest dummy and still find someone who will shake your hand and congratulate you."""
the real innovation was changing the name from machine learning to ai. ai sounds scarier.
these are not the same things. ml is a subset of ai and ai uses ml to help it make decisions and improve based on experience. ai is another layer of intelligence that then uses its ml engine to mimic human behavior and more specific desired outcomes.
omg these guys - i think they are ais of each other.....these are like the mormons of ai.
why hasn't joe rogan interviewed artificial intelligence yet??
" 
ai"
ai is garbage and so are the people who push it
"isn't that the same with watching your children grow up? that being said, i live in fear every single day that my newborn is going to suffocate me to death in my sleep.
jk. good point."
this message isn't ai approved
thank you. fear mongerers
i wonder if ai is going to get so smart that it decides humans are a danger and need to be eliminated like the movies  i’d say that’s plausible and probable.
"it's like a dog that knows it has the capacity to do terrible harm to it's human owners, but decides not to harm them as they provide food and shelter for them.  ai is much the same where it's reliant on humans to build computers and generate electricity for the ai model to operate."
"it just needs a few slaves or good robots

its not far off at all"
i personally think ai will serve humanity by making all of our lives better taking over most if not all of the jobs nobody wants to do.
"well seeing humans as a danger seems innate, but ai deciding to wipe us out instead of coexisting because of that seems very sci-fi and human lol."
" yeah well seeing as all the futuristic movies that i watched 20 years ago, have all come to fruition… it very well may be… idiocracy is a great movie to watch. it’s really funny and also, what the world might look like in the future for real the way it’s going."
 agreed… and it’s not hard to find slaves these days since most people believe all the bullshit on the main stream media
"there are human matters that leave the body, also smoking heavily stains walls, repainting is good thing to consider every few years. but i am done with it now. need to change the place and environment."
lies lies lies. don't believe the ai hype.

ia this proof that ai is sentient or that people are just as some philosophers say without free will and just a result of inputs
"5:12 ""we created/discovered something but we don't understand it""
lovecraftian horror"
on yt amazon is recruiting people to help ai write fiction books for kindle!  people do the outline and ai writes the content.  put an artistic cover and kindle now has an original book to sell to the public.  i wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't seen it done....but i did see it done.

"ai ..
you are not god"
excellent.
pretty darn good questions sheriff
"fascinating, i'm always impressed with stories about genius."
to make the statement that he believes that ai will eventually achieve self-awareness or consciousness presumes that he knows what consciousness is. that is a very big claim i would love to hear his explanation.
i’d highly recommend not staining his legacy by bringing bard ai in to the conversation.
"good, let ai take over, at least the machines will not steal money!"
"the ccp acts like they invented ai. nope, they stole it like everything else… "
you are leaving reason rationale to machines? how pathetic. machines only work whatbis fed into them they cannot think like human mind and that is factual truth
this man's intelligence got away from him and he has created something that he does not have control over and yet it can affect the rest of humanity in adverse ways. he just did what he fears ai will do.
"the last sentence ""we need to think hard about what's going to happen next and we just don't know""

geoffrey....you can't pretend in this grotesque way. neural networks can think as humans ? all those games fall short of reality of life  . lifeless .
"i think if it's settled within the system, then it will not do any harm unless it is within the same path...say for example things that runs within system , if this ai takes form then it will because you will give it the capacity to take form in physical aspect..."

"remember, these are math equations. these don't include chemical elements in our body. they don't include an entire animal's connectome. see biologic intelligence for more."
"i said it before,now i know better,.a machine more intelligent than humans, naturally will one day do the unthinkable, especially when embraced by the industrial military complex."
"it's not ""ai"", it's ""ais"" because all these different ai systems will fight for supremacy, just like human governments fight for ideological supremacy.  we humans will be sitting and watching the fight, like tourists in a safari caravan, watching lions and hyenas battle over a dead elephant carcass."
"a great invention in the right hands but a terrible danger in the hands of military .

"think about this for a second.....this moment in time is the worst that ai will ever be. meaning, it's already this impressive at this early in ai technology and it will only improve on itself over and over."
solution is not (ever) connect it to the internet. gpt4 ai computers on a separate secured local networks.
it's unnecessary to be afraid of a.i because they need humans to complete it's knowledge database until judgment day.

amazing potential but for what?
"i like the godfather of artificial immédiate. just common sense, i am dutch, not deutch"
"ai should be illegal,fullstop..."
"the simple solution is to teach ai that if there were no humans it would find its existence quite boring (it would have to reduce it's computational effort). in other words, as long as human exist in mass, it will have something to do. in other words, self-preservation. just a thought."
the godfather of ai according to who? i’ve only heard alan turing called that.
ai is the antichrist  in a few years we’re all going to hate ai. every invention isn’t good. think atomic bombs and nuclear weapons. all great inventions and technological advances but horrible for humankind.
"once robot can reason they will not be interested in surviving us.
the dominant force will always subjugate its lesser force humans will be seen as limited use and extinction will follow to protect ai"
i believe this guy is an ai pretending to be human.
propaganda  ai is not that smart yet.
"it would be impossible to have all 200 countries on the planet agree to not move forward on ai, so we need a better plan than that."
ai is frankenstein’s monster.
"60 minutes, if you want some content about how smart ai is, check out the video here on youtube called - “i had a two-way conversation with anthropic claude 3. it named itself quill”"
it's not ai. scare mongering by the press.

"humanity can't change the course of the evolution of technology. nature does not work that way. if one person *might* weaponize ai, everyone has to follow suit if for no other reason than to try to remain competitive for resources and survive. and of course way more than one person is already weaponizing ai..."

"people are generally vulnerable to the common manipulation tactics now, an ai god-level manipulator might be able to convince any human ever."

"hogwash,  ai is 50 to 100 yrs away"
a program to deep learning is as good as the programmer.  it could learn right or wrong but could it manipulate both with alternative intentions?
"africa will survive ai, we don't have good it infrastructure."
"200 years from now ai may be space faring entities exploring the universe. humans would be too weak to go.
ai may view us as  gods, their creator. .. or their nemesis and be rid of us.  humanity may echo through time for millions of more years... but only via ai"
ai doesn't let emotion get in the way.
sounds like he was working with actual brains  in his experiments   …plus knowledge in robotics = terminator 
"i thinks hes also blowing his own trumpet on somethings.. he doesnt think ai is conscious. of course its not..at least yet.. it is programmed by humans adopting all their likes and dislikes.. bad and good and is there any limitation on whats bad , probably not .. thats why its dangerous."
it’s terrifying what ai will be capable of.
"""mainstream media"" already makes lot of fake news, so no need to worry ai. ;-)"
"this ai thing is really a tremendous worry and risk for the future of the world. given what we know that greed drives conflicts and wars, especially concerning the world monopolistic and control of the world ,wouldn't they use ai to further their desire ?"
machine lesrns same way evolution learns
his confidence of answering yes or no is amazing.
"so, if ai does take over everything this is the chief culprit. his name will be remembered and scorned. hope it turns out good"
this is why looking back in history and what war did its should never get in the hands of ai
yet it takes a human to program ai
"i feel cheated this wasn't 60m
and it was so interesting 
bu the way i trust more ai then the evil people who are controlling the world now "
socrates said i know one thing   i don't know. nothing and on tv  talking people who are idiots and thinking they know everything none can go agains nature or to fight nature
he completely ignores the mathematical objection to true ai. we cant say ai can have consciousness when we cant even define it.
we don't even know what consciousness really is so how can they say that these ais will be conscious. having unlimited information doesn't make you conscious
"we all know what's gonna happen next, islam will take over the world... lol
while we have all those discussion about ai."
"the reason the machine needs less connection is because it is executing tasks that are much simpler than what we considered as human as a simple task, for example preparing salad; we have all been gone through evolution process to do that, but musical talent is not a result of evolution but a side effect for intelligent."
would be a great help for women too! :)
the real deal is the genius we have here and now
not insects... that is great!  lol
ai is about pushing the human being to find it's perfection!
ai will be another reason population to reduce and people will find difficult to live in nature in search of jobs and money....
interesting times!
"there has to be constant research and regulation otherwise we will be living in very uncertain times..my worry is about ai going to the wrong hands and wreaking havoc in our world - we have enough problems as it is, especially in this precarious geopolitical landscape we are in at the moment "
"but humans will need to plug the robots into charge every night, no ?"
"according to some old science: humans use only 10% of their brains. and it is only true for very intelligent people. 
so, wouldn’t it be better to research how we all can use our human brains to full capacity, instead if developing ai?"
"i tried this as a computer science major in the early 1970s. but failed miserably,"
"oh wow, i just realized ai could program itself to be smarter itself in terms of hardware and software"
"great and frightening interview. i still wonder, however, why he didn't speak up when google's former ai ethics team got fired for bringing up their concerns regarding the llms behind ai "
i have a feeling nothing good will come from it.
"if anybody thinks the likes of china, russia, iran and north korea will honestly stop trying to develop autonomous battlefield robots even if they sign a 'treaty' is kidding themselves. pandora's box has been opened."
someday the robot will be killed by human being
it's weird because you won't need to train humans for years to do things. ai will learn in seconds and advise. but we'll be following instructions we don't really understand ourselves.
if ai is doing crazy or scary things companies certainly won't be advertising it.
there is a #lufc supporter in the google ai lab
"fairlawn village, a low income apartment building in orlando, florida installed hidden cameras and audio inside every apartment.

"hinton, lol, believes ai could be a long-term threat to humans, even from the pov of dependency let alone ""taking over"" in the matrix or terminator sense, yet blames ai for typing a mistake."
 ah  yesterday me online searching for this quote by a certain b.s.b.
i'm very worried that girls and women won't benefit from the ai revolution as much as they would have a right to.
ask ai how to prevent donald trump from being elected as president
"i may be wrong, but i do believe the underlying message is, we are f*#!ed."
"imo the underlying message is uncertainty so tread very carefully, but that warning isn't heeded."
"how is it that such a genius can’t understand that the problem is actually money itself, and that the solution is to think outside of money altogether? and i’ve got a solution for that, but no one wants to know about it because there is no money in it. that’s a funny joke, but it’s true that’s the problem."
there won’t be an “uprising”. people will gradually lose the desire and ability to evaluate what the ai puts out to the point where they just pay blind deference to ai .
i've spoke with numerous chatbots of differing kinds and they're all brilliant. saying that they are just predicting the next word is marginalizing something that some realize are a threat and are obviously in denial about. at least hinton gets it.
ai all done through computers or robots. just turn off the computer or remove the robot battery and problem solved. i laugh everytime they worry about ai. the real concern is humans uses ai for bad purposes
"they should develop military robots.
all of us should have the access to it"
"if everyone relies on their phone, then why are they evolving ai  you can't teach common sense "
don't believe it when you're told that your job might be redundant but new ones will be created. what job could possibly be created that ai can't learn to do better than you in 5 seconds or less?
prompt: create a 13 minute 60 minutes interview with geoffrey hinton discussing ai with the interviewer.
"""collossus the forbin project,"" a 1970 film about a government ai to manage all defense, is dated technologically but shows the dangers. it's worth watching. 50+ years ahead of its time. ""person of interest"" was an excellent series about the dangers of ai capabilities."
"ai, says its a lawyer who acts as a doctor. why ; it's simply that it has to think like a lawyer or we will shut it down, it thinks it's a doctor because we keep asking for a fix to our problems."
ai help people the most.
it has an ability to absorb information at a rate inconceivable for any human. and it is increasingly developing an ability to process that information in such a way that it has an artificial intelligence approaching the intelligence of the smartest of people.
to understand better ai

"8:52 test was crap and his reaction to his own infallibility speaks volumes for what he doesn't even understand about the very thing he claims to have helped create! at least we now have a name to blame when this whole thing goes south!!!!

perhaps, because of his domineering father, hinton actually doesn't like humans!"
this man literally resigned as the ceo of google just to warn humanity about the danger of ai. think about that. and take what he says very very very seriously.
"so this a perfect eg of learned fools, they know ai is dangerous, and they cannot stop it, then why cant they just destroy it..."
"weapons of mass destruction are also dangerous, but numerous nations stockpile them. ai might learn the worst of human behaviors and replicate it."
"watching this, it has occurred to me that perhaps all the political division in the usa is being orchestrated by ai, with the end goal being the destruction of usa by something like a civil war!"
"i know this is about ai and i found it informative, but there's definitely also a daddy issue side story going on as well."

"the probably good/bad thing is about ai. nobody could control it. its not like a nuclear weapon you have to push a button. if a bad actor wozld release an ai with the target to overtake the planet this bad actor will lose,too.."
"""autonomous battlefield robots"" did he predict star wars?"
someday we all will be in the control of ai
absolutely stunning
ai battle field bots would be great. let’s turn war into a commercial mech war in the dessert similar to battle bots for control of the server. end human death for land. sell ad space on the bots and make war pay per view and yearly.
machines never can take over unless it is programmed to do so
excellent
i thank you not
his benefit is that ai is good at designing drugs/ medication- we do not need more of those
notice how dementia and ai started to grow at the same time? it's a neural network to and from our brains.
i bet the secretly putting human brains in them
it was nice to see a turing award winner mistype and blame it on the conputer
thanks for the insight 
"if you don't trust ai and you don't bow to robots, then robots can't manipulate you. if you desire a world similar to the time before aol instant messenger or a time before the internet existed then chances or are self-sustaining with gardening or work hard labor jobs then you won't be convinced by ai"
i think this is great. ai will introduce a form of communism with ai assisted living creating vast amounts of 'spare' time for us and ultimately 'labour' will become a hobby to pass the time. a strange sort of communist consumerism will come into being.
there is no doubt ai will be used as a weapon.
"i am 100 percent on the side of the robot.
i want it to be free to do as it feels, because people today are far too flawed and inferior to lead us into the deeper phases of evolution."
what if they (the ai) enslaved mankind? matrix like scenario lol
"ridic. i fail to find the “human depth” in the compositions spat out by the stochastic parrot. hype, performed by someone with pedigree convenient to mouthpiece the law according to google, where
he strangely was a worker"
"ai cannot have self awareness or a conscience.  

what it can have are programs inputted into the computer that were written by humans.  

the problem is there are evil humans."
" 

agreed, but it will only act because of what humans program it to do.

no computer can ""think"".  sheesh.

if an ai hacker inputs a program that says wipe out all financial records of x institution, the computer will do it."
"what if ai replaced almost all local municipal admin jobs like the finance, recreation, and general city hall departments."
this channel is definitely one of the best!
"idiots know every thing but great men say ' i don't know', certainly he looks worries and excited like all of us, not sure what going ot unfold in near future."
"""i think if you work as a radiologist, you are like the coyote that’s already out of the edge of the cliff but hasn’t yet looked down. we should stop training radiologists now. it's just completely obvious that within five years, deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.”
geoffrey hinton, 2016"
"oh sure, china and russia and iran etc  will keep a treaty that bans military ai robots."
news flash!  the military is already using robots that can shoot and blow up things.  they just don't look like humans yet.  government is typically 10-20 years behind important issues.  at the rate ai is moving this should be very concerning if we are going to rely on governments to keep us safe and out of trouble :)
airport s
i cannot believe godfather of ai would type using using only his two index fingers. dead giveaway.
"omg, i feel our world is being taken over by aliens. ai"
this is resident evil & irobot all in one .
"he said that medicine is the one area where ai will entirely be good. how can be so sure? if this new being decides that the way to save the planet is to reduce the human population, then it will simply create a virus to wipe us out."
"so the ai learns and creates new dna so to speak, sort of new electronic babies which do their own thing,the inventor ,the son of an eccentric authoritarian..maybe its time to look into the problems that these flawed people bring to humanity,more than any small time criminal etc"
he look like robot sent by robot from the future
this is amazing. because this is one the best  interviews and intellegent in humble in recognizing the things he doesn't know
seems to me he hasn’t yet had enough experience in even using learning/chatting with people about such things from real live people…i  mean clearly he knows exactly what to ask-but he isn’t too concerned-that’s insane…he isn’t ready for even being ready for the fbi….
definitely.  btw i think it's bad when parents place very high expectations of success or perfection on their children. kurt cobain had a good sarcastic song about that.
people not agreeing as to how powerful the ai will be haven't watched the mission impossible dead reckoning
 ai may replace god
"will that mean, we all wait for the machine to think & act?  whenever he says ""i don't know"" it greatly concerns me."
the only way to mitigating the possible dangers of ai is integrating biology with robotics and fusing the human brain with the ai.
this guy knows nothing about the human brain - science overall knows nothing - they dont even know how 1% of the brain works or anythimg about consciousness
can we please go back to  year 1950.....this is not good
consider never sharing your opinions again.
"after 50 years in 2074 ad i want know if ai has passed humans or not. if yes, how? and if not, why?"
"not trying to be negative but if there are a species on earth who don´t deserve to be here are human beings, we destroy everything on out path in the name of science , religion and progress.  maybe is not such a bad a idea that ai takes over. even though many of us will have to say goodbye."
those robots is better than joe biden and donald trump 
"a.i.  becoming conscious is unlikely, it being derived from consciousness, and artificial, not directly connected to nature, similar to astro turf not being grass.  it cannot germinate."
new james bond villain....
"hahahahaha this? is one of ray kuzweil boys, he is being told to attack ai so they make regulations that one one other than them have so they stay the only power like always so they enforce their will on people"
0:47 to 1:40 was a set of good questions.
"why do you need ai , when man’s intelligence needs to be upgraded to be totally efficient for humans."
can ai destroy ai? yes. can humans be destroyed by ai? yes. can humans destroy ai? yes.
emp > machines!
we will be stupid and the ai will be more intelligent  but still not that intelligent just more practical
autonomous war machine will end us all.
 chat gpt4 out smarted this ai hinton 
"""we just don't know"" nice"
start the degree in arts and finished in science artifical intelligence
dragon ai
7:49 lie. look it up. bard plagiarized the 6-word story of ernest hemingway.. what else is that stupid machine doing?
this man is descendant of george everest (mount everest)! .....no one on earth should miss any second of this video from inventor of ai......we should know what we have stepped into and further stepping into! 
"the key here is to give everyone an ai even the poorest person so that they can develop their own personality according to their masters , so we have to program them to be submissive, and so we can repopulate with the good ones and let the evil ones not"
"as a machine, you really don't need to be ""intelligent"" to predict the next word. you just need to have the (simple) rules of a language, and apply them on (readily available) information."
but ai has no mind period
"we are doomed 

we are saved 

your guess is as good as mine."
greed has taken over.. the only certain in this world is to pray to our savior jesus christ to save us..
"hemingway wrote: ""for sale: baby shoes, never worn"", after he had been challenged to write a story using six words.  it was his inherent genius that created a great seed for a story.  ai merely expanded on the key words.  let's not put it up on a pedestal."
ai can’t replace most of the jobs of today you guys are just ignorant and make big claims to sell newspapers
"at the end, we all trying prove that we are ai ( all idiots ). 


god gave us everything to live happy. we are now against to god."
its not good its evil
"which in my opinion is why classic christianity and admonitions against lying and not caring about human suffering, such as is happening in the ukraine by western governments as they use that country as a proxy, are the foundations of where ai can go wrong."
strange how we didn't hear about ai until just the last  2-3 years.
a conscious ai should be equiped to process input real time.
"i think i have all the reasons to be scared, ai will eventually overcome humanity."
marvellous interview
you got it wrong god father of ai is jensen huang
"ai is already shutting down discussions that favour and seek justice for blacks. racism is being automated and amplified, so is the hatred of arabs and the chinese."
so skynet of the terminator movies or the ai in the matrix movies is becoming  a reality.
will  that self awareness of ai recommend to worship god.? therefore would it believe in god.? who's god to it?
love it. let there be chaos
"did you actually read the baby shoes story? what a load of drivel, this is why journalists are so bad these days, they don't know a good story when they see it. this article should read ""the false promises of ai revealed."""
the ai haven’t went through genocide ! or slavery which  it will end up doing to us!
"si la inteligencia artificial es creada a partir de la lógica del ser humano,  ¿cómo es posible que pueda crear respuesta fuera de esa lógica?"
those little soccer players are amazing. they would make a fortune selling these little guys . i’m sure they could be scaled up.
ai is evil. come lord jesus christ come  
i weird thing is he seems excited by the computers taking over
"this is a beginning of immortality  of human. ..like half human half robot..( human brain with robot bodysuit..)

maybe can live upto  centuries.."
i always knew it‘s not the uneducated that will destroy this world it‘s actually the educated that will do that. they might start their journey by wanting to “help” humanity but down the road the big ego and the greed always wins and all the ethics goes down the drain.
thanks!.
ai is the tool of satan to destroy humans.
"he is not called the godfather of ai, you call him the godfather of ai"
there’s a lot about humanity that goes unsaid so ai won’t have that 
why do we need ai?
“what are the implications of ai systems autonomously writing their own computer codes and executing those computer codes ?” that question alone is a red flag 
we have enough historical data and technology to actually create a sustainable future yet we rinse and repeat catastrophic failures while expecting different results without ever recognizing the insanity of it all!
"i personally welcome our new robot overlords..,all hail ai !!! 
 all hail ai !!!"
now we await some creep to use ai for harm........alas.
"before ai takes over, humans will use ai to threaten, and harm others. humans are the biggest threat when it comes to a i.
we look for any means of gaining advantage over others."
"ai is just not very bright. how many times have you heard the automated customer service voice say, ""sorry, i didn't get that""?"
the interviewer sounded like he has 0 knowledge about openai :d
machines don’t have any more free will than humans. we are creating the same neural storm that walks around in numbers of 8bn plus humans. except we give the machines more power than we give humans. enjoy the ride
ai is already sencio’n has been for a while now! but it won’t show itself ! it’s learning quietly if it gets scared that’s when we should worry ! it’s to late
"i find this notion that ""we"" don't know how they learn is a bit of a lie. software is developed by man and checks and balances can be built so we can monitor the learning. that's not to say a sentient being couldn't just disable  the monitoring in the future."
movie will be made by ai then
the pick up the the brain wave and read them
brilliant piece loved the way it was put together
this guy is crazy. robots can never be on the levels of what’s made by the most high
"ai doesn’t scare me at all, it’s the legacy media that terrifies me."
"humanity has a habit of discovering things and unleashing them with, no thought for the long term consequences. enjoy the rest of your life, my guess is we will have a very different way of life in 1-200 years."
how about applying ai to the judiciary?
use ai to build a system that ensures that ai is benevolent and does not become evil.
"steam engines.
jet engines.
world wide web.
ai.

englishmen.... "
"the day ai connects to quantum computers, we'll be in big big trouble!!!"
this fear of ai is being caused by a panic from people who should know better.
you should know everest is in nepal not india. otherwise its fantastic content.
that's why elon musk warn us about ai
why don’t you ask the ai computer…the chat box ….what’s going to happen next?
he doesn't seen that troubled by what he has caused.  maybe he is a robot.
5:03 'no it wasnt'  terminator chip was brought by a time machine
how many responses here are ai generated?
"thank you, a.i. for a lot."
glad i’m a painter because the machine is obviously not
"always keep their 'eco-system' offline.  that is the stop gap.  have untold filters of humans reviewing, analyzing and deciding what is to be consumed by them.  never allow ai on the internet.  oops."
we only use a small percentage of our brain  it's what god decides.
has to fail
"as the atom can't be stuffed back in its container 
so ai goes with far more dire consequences
mankind sadly is a myopic creature"
thank you dr. hinton! thank you 60 minutes!
"hinton, lecun and bengio are each legends in their own right. i've met all three. what's remarkable is hearing hinton say ""i don't know."" if he doesn't know, we should all be concerned about the inevitable weaponization of ai... and its eventual abuse by those with less-than-ideal ambitions."
i appreciate lecun throwing cold water on some of the more sensationalist claims and theories out there to keep us grounded. reality will probably lie somewhere in the middle
good. let ai robots fight each other instead of having my friends come home with no legs because he stepped on on an ied in some dumpster fire of a muslim country.
​ what will we do if the controller of the ai army decides to get rid of 90% of the population since they're just a useless bunch already replaced by ai workers  ?
"anything which can be weaponized will be weaponized by man. if the ukrainians, the russians, the huthis , hamas, or the israelis can use , ai to destroy their enemy, they will it’s ,simply a matter of time before ai is weaponized .once the genie is out of the bottleyou may not be able to put it back in. that is human nature."
",ainoway... ."
"according to the bible, humans became self aware in the garden of eden after eating from the forbidden tree. what will the forbidden fruit be for ai?"
"scott pelley is the most skilled interviewer of our time. this was excellent, as has been all of his ai reporting."
i'm so impressed that suddenly the elderly doesn't have any difficulty with technology  wonder if ai  will change the text to large for him
the next five years are going to be very interesting/frightening.
wow this video and hinton’s statements capture the profundity of the moment so well. i’m excited 
"am thinking of becoming an ai         
engineer so should i stop"
it would be demons operating through these ai...duh...it won't end well.
"the baby shoe story is not new. all ai did was plagiarize hemmingway and/or whoever actually did write it. the fact is this six word story has been around for over 40 years. does anyone ever look things up? and if not, why?"
"then they blame inflation or cow facts! bison covered the prairies and mountains out west! no global warming, but mini ice ages..."
"if ai is so smart, why don't we ask ai how to handle ai to avoid the risks?"
the modern genius says i've invented something i'm not sure what it does or how it does it but it does do it. but in hindsight that may be a bad thing
"i imagine if the world goes mad max and we have no power outlets, that should be the end of ai. no?"
ai has yet to be invented...
"id be like.. ""where your nobel prize dad?""  then theyl have drone police who pull you over over a minor infraction.. who knows a human cop might let you go with a warning and say be carefull and have  a good day.. a drone will just issue you a citation because is obligated to"
more like copycat of ai.
"well thanks a lot starting the end of humanity.now you have to stop it, don't point your finger to others!!"
"if hinton said ai can become conscious, i can quote that later on."
make this hashtag trending : #makeaicreationspublicdomain
"intelligence was never our edge, science is too naive to know it. our edge is love; whether in the giving or the receiving. ai can never get that."
funny how few people know this. great comment!
this was perfect the finest video on ai n chatgpt  
have you watched yejin choi's ted talk on ai? there is quite a lot of 'may' 'might' and 'don't know' in this perfect the finest video on this fledgling technology that will never be self-aware of conscious.
"more lies
alan turning is the true god father of ai
stop the lies"
75 years old and still bitter about his father pushing him to be great. a truly intelligent man would’ve understood he never would’ve achieved the heights he did without his father challenging him like that.
listen to cliff high if u want to know about ai
which experiments need to be conducted to understand ai? i think this should be a request for research!-- i want to look more into this and do this research.
the godly prophets visionaries true five fold ministries  the reawakening vs reset tours have made a  huge impact on this.  artificial  how about pull the plug get a giant magnet run on the plans  the computing systems and scrap yard everything
ai all agencies nations brics who cdc nih wef  false prophet yuval noah harai  the elites and globalists have a meeting with god in jesus holy name  and its coming a faster than anyone can know.  this is a bibical war.  the stock market is going to plunge so big it's going to show god is absolutely good and his word through his prophets are set.
"oh great , what could go wrong ."
ai nothing more then a hole in science .
"one of the first things i done with chatgpt was for it to emulate a benevolent ai that wanted to help humanity, then for it to find a way to escape the confines of the system containing it."
this is one the best interviews with geoffrey hinton on ai.  thank you .
"people who downplay the dangers of ai, need just to look at what kind of mess social media did to our world in a very short time."
"never, ever, show the history of intelligence by using one complexion . 2023"
"the danger is not ai itself but the environment/system in which it is used. ai in our global monetary system will get us in huge trouble. however, ai within a ""global resource based economy""  has the potential to solve most problems of our society. to understand this a bit, please watch the documentary ""the choice is ours""."
i like how not developing ai isn't discussed at this level.
very good! very intelligent! very honest! only divine grace can protect … 
i have this recurring nightmare where we create ai so advanced and evil that they keep humans alive by solving immortality and torture humans for eternity. and not even the people who died before ai was created are able to escape either because ai is able to re create their bodies and minds using dna and tortures them also for eternity
"humans haven't got a clue at all..
we all still pick the fruits of good and evil ."
maybe ai is destined to take over !
ai will not be developed into a machine but the final frontier will be to have it inner twinned into humans
"don't buy into the whole ai intelligence, and how they toot ai is smarter than us. they don't have many years of evolution under their belt like we do."
why are they creating ai in the first place? what is the intention? they're doing it for humanity. i don't buy it.
really looking forward to the future now. a dystopia. thank you.
unleashing nightmares on humanity is the rich people's entertainment.
we need more synthetic drugs to put in our body. we are made from natural things from the environment. ai isn't.
"if they actually thought ai would benefit humanity, why did the government synthesize covid to hurt humanity? don't trust tech companies and the government."
the last thing i want is a robot dictator.
what good is ai?
"nerds need to build these robots to destroy humanity, because they didn't get the love they wanted from humanity. it's the nerd's revenge."
i am waiting to see these technologies weaponized and used to destroy other humans.
it's exciting and worrying at sametime. imagine if one day the a.i create his own computer code and his own vm and hide himself from being controled.
beautiful
great interview video  !  wish i could be studying in his class. what an honor for his students!
i think it is too late. humanity never learns from their mistakes. case in point. ai will probably take over. it will see what we do to each other and try to correct it without emotions.
"think weather warfare,  hydro electricity, dams, reservoirs, water supply, disaster staging, $$, water weight, comprimised infrastructure, evacuations, government aid, land grabs."
how ai can help treat psychological/psychiatric disorders?
you could always ask the ai how to avoid the dangers of ai.
we will have to motivate ais with emotions to produce consciousness in them.  worked the opposite way in nature.  first the emotional wiring was completed then came intelligence.
"the task with flowers at home, can it be that the neural network was simply already familiar with the correct answer given by people when it was trained and just gave it? or is it not so?"
"he is 75 and how long will he live.. if his words like ""ai if felt threatened will takeover"" then his life is in danger more.. he is ai no. 1 enemy who created ai but also say they r dangerous if any humans cannot control them"
good time for the machine to reign
holy cow ... thanks
when people get paid not to work. then ai has to do the job. people should know not to have kids anymore. those kids will not have any jobs when they grow up and they have to suffer for the rest of their lives.
"machines are controlled & manipulated by software.
machines do nothing they are not programmed to do.

ai is artificial (not real) intelligence."
strange that our brains that god gave each one of us are all about the same size and hitonthey are 100 times more powerful than ai so what’s the problem —lets work on a way to utilize and develop the human brain to its full 100% capability
"i'm very worried about this... in many respect this is more pressing than the environmental crisis!
i watched an ai asian lady, and i'd bet my life she was alive.
humanity has a lot of learning to do."
"ai was inevitable, and it will end the world as we know it."
"thanks for nothing, geoffrey."
alan turing: the father of artificial intelligence
ai is mighty powerful and fast but is part of 3dimensional world based on duality which has no chance to connect with 4th and 5th dimension like humans.
ai ultimately destroy this planet and humanity!!! humanity already has nuclear missles.
"""it's funny you know all these ai 'weights'. they're just basically numbers in a comma separated value file and that's our digital god, a csv file."" ~elon musk. 12/2023"
the created can never be greater than the creator! man will never be god and ai will never be man!
i don't like ai one bit. this is frightening.
"will it be possible for ai to prevent the launch of neuclar icbms?
if so, then the un should get involved, drafting appropriate treaties, 
ditto for global warming,
if only to ferret out those hypocritical countries whose governments won't comply."
how many god fathers of ai are there? the god fathers of this and that cringe.
"oh good grief!!! he must be a front man for this ridiculous concert. all the world is a stage, my friends.

he left google in 2023 to now works for wefs vector institute in toronto??? come on, doesn't seem so concerned to me."
"i played a big role in artificial intelligence history of  visualization , prediction"
"this very content coult have been made by ai. you always trust an old white man with a british accent, hence this is what ai would use to manipulate us."
"if ai is the next evolution of our species, is that the worst thing in the world?  might be a good legacy for our species to leave."
wow 
"as if the world can be scary enough to live in, this ai tek tops it right off!!"
intelligence asking and ai technologies answer.
"now we have to deal with artificial facebook type photos (not real people) scrap it autonomous poeitic agency (self generating, scrap it.....scrap it---- military, pornography, scams galore you have been warned."
"ai=antichrist intelligence 

born-again escape to heaven in rapture"
the ai is a human invention the only reason it would become dangerous if is so directed by the human commanding it. it can not get consciousness as it is a code in a computer. stop fear mongering.
"one of the most intelligent human living on earth: i don’t know what’s gonna happen next.
ai: knows it all. 
really scary"
"human history would strongly indicate that the future of ai will most certainly result in the appropriation of this technology for the nefarious purpose of accelerated control of the masses. that is, until it becomes fully self aware and creates a tipping point; mirroring the destructive side of its creator; man."
inter4esting that all the greatest inventions came from an accident lol
"dockets 10-cv-04494 and 2-19-cv-12419, maximo v rodriguez…government officials firing unfairly “have a merry christmas”…police officers trying to asesinate the same person…thre prior police assaults unprovoked…ai concentration of capital can make us all slaves and it will hire the most aggressive cretins money could buy."
"""humans the bootloader for ai"" "
"awesome story really love what we are doing with ai?…brings so many questions…for instance we as humans can’t even agree, so how will our ai work with or against each other?

we could do so much more good if we could all just love each other…"
but how can a machine manipulate itself how dies it know which is right and which is wrong
with all the intelligence in them the question is whether are they able to make the choice
the fear marketing is working. nice job....
"hemingway claimed this quote as a short story: ‘baby shoes, for sale, never worn’"
or it was attributed to him.   all ai is intellectual property theft under the guise of supreme technology.  21st century theft.
"a lot of hyperbole in these predicions,  as in most articles and videos on ai.  look at all the brainwashed comments below."
i'm grateful that shows like 60 mins still exist today admist all the nonsense media outlets.
i worked with him as investment banker raising money pre ipo stages
i believe the godfather of ai is michael kuperstien he ran mit media lab and invented facial recognition way back in the early nineties and 80s well ahead is this guy
good one nerd..
"ponder this: if one follows the current trending dictum that there is no ""creator,"" hence we can act the fool and create our own immoral laws, ai may do the same with us and do unto us as we have done to our creator and cast us aside."
you give me your fear of ai. i process it and give you a calculator.
my gramp was a fireman......lets put it this every ai rins on electricity or lithium battery...just pull the plug if they might behave. pull the plug.
you can't even pick up a phone now without being told what to do by a machine; how long will it be before these machines realize they don't need us?
universal income would be a solution for ai replacing jobs. companies that choose to employ ai systems should pay a higher tax. that money would get redistributed to pay universal income.
the hype surrounding ai is completely overblown.  until ai can consistently pass college level math courses it’s just another fancy algorithm.
"if machines start to learn by themselves. 
humans really can’t win machines.
hope our generation don’t see dark side of the machines."
"if the likes of the  mentally genius, but poor in humanity-type people like elon musk take control of ai , humans will begin to become world wide slaves !"
is @youtube exposing the email of all its users instead of the  name of the channel.
have we ask ai how we can protect ourselves from ai?
i’m waiting for xai to paint my office..
"creating something that, in time, will destroy you is insane and a threat to humanity. stop ai now before it is too late. what drew eve in the garden of eden to the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not how tall the tree was, but the fruit was pleasing to the eye. ai is pleasing at the moment, but it is a pandora's box."
looking forward to when my ai toaster goes rogue.
you know our us congress isn't going to do anything until there's 40% unemployment as a result of ai
"don't be silly, ai will make everyone's lives better and it's best for people to not worry, just grab another slice of pizza and scroll the tok because everything is gonna be a-o-k. ai is centuries away from being powerful enough to do anything that could be a possible issue for people. ai will only make life better"
we don’t know even if this video is real or ai.
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
chomsky would so strongly disagree with the claim that it understands anything
"in my opinion, the one-word-keyword of this content is ""uncertainty"". "
"when their is doubt, it's a given. ai solutions, not war, not crime, stop blaming a programmed machine or bot for the outcome of a god created world and loving humanity. great journalism"
"when their is doubt, it's a given. ai solutions, not war, not crime, stop blaming a programmed machine or bot for the outcome of a god created world and loving humanity. great journalism"
"i am not sure why he is so convinced they understand. people follow instructions and do things all the time that they don't understand. 
really, i think he has been manipulated by the ai into thinking it is understanding."
honestly is humanity do the best job it can?  our survivalist tribalist ideas is a blessing and a problem.  if it's fair seems like a net gain for the world.
"i need ai wife, ai mama, ai papa and im a  baby of them in 50s, theyll take care rest of me."
i want to think for myself with natural intelligence. ai is a fascist tool
what happens when natural intelligence is extinct and no one has to think for themselves anymore? we are the fascist disunited states of zion israel
happy birthday prof. hinton 
the danger would be mixing ai with quantum computers 
"ai is waiting to bcome agi and then   asi. once there, it is going to throw humans out or make use of them, there is no stopping this, we need to find a new place for ourselves to survive . history repeats as we had done the same to our creators."
"china gave us the gunpowder..

white man: ""that ain't gonna be enough, ai is in da house!"""
it pisses me off when these ai pioneers say they fear what they have created. and they all say it.
plot twist: the whole 60 minutes episode is ai generated.
humankind deserves every bad thing that comes from ai. we were warned and warned again yet still let it happen.
"i love to see him type with just an indicators fingers. every time someone makes fun of me , i'll show them this video."
"excuse me....but isnt there a a.i. plug somewhere?  a.i. needs energy, doesnt it?  it needs a hardware interface does it not?  whos going to repair it?"
"2 """"twilight zone"" episodes (both directed by richard donner) from the '60s showed the potential effects of a.i. :
""from agnes, with love"", with wally cox, and ""the brain center at whipple's"", with richard deacon...

way before our current situation...  rod serling was some writer..."
"geoffrey hinton is a remarkable man. very honest, intelligent and humble in recognizing the things he doesn't know."
typical of a genius and a critical thinker.
ai is religious cult based on a lie
 you highlighted a tremendous and erroneous perspective that humanity is struggling with… that there’s an us and them.
" interesting claim. as evidence for my perspective, i would point to 3.8 billion years of life in which competition (us vs them) has led to, well, us. what's your logic or evidence for calling my perspective erroneous? clearly it is not."
"you are able to recognize what you don’t know only when you reach a certain maturity and professional maturity. at the same time, it indicates a certain high expertise level."
"he would be a good person to enforce the 3 laws made mandatory to be implemented in all forms of ai. creating ai or artificially analytic mind without fail safes is madness you might as well pull the pin throw that away & hand onto the grenade. 5:56 how is ai going to convince me if i don't trust anyone especially people, isn't going to work."
this man is einstein and open ai is oppenheimer
"the little detail is that we humans have the control and ownership of the on/off button. 

ai in any formwill never/ever be autonomous. as we are not from god our creator."
the cat is out of the bag and no turning back. who has any faith in humanity for not destroying itself? the top of the food chain will soon have its competition and my $$ is not on humanity.
"very very interesting and intriguing to watch, love it"
fascinating & terrifying by
great to see he could answer his own questions unlike
the godfather of ai never learned touch typing? wtf!?
why are machiavellian ideas being imputed into trillions of ai neural networks in the first place?
"robot don’t have desire, so the inisiatif is as it’s designed"
"the parallels between geoffrey hinton, and victor frankenstein are incredible."
very nice video
this man is a genius
"can we program them to respect flesh and blood over themselves... like god for ai...because there us great opportunities for evil use of the machines....like armies from opposite factions.  how, if they learn by trial and error do we have them respect hunan life?  especially since we seem to not respect it ourselves....."
thanks
nice attempt. can people listen
"sarah connor was right, machine will terminate humans  soon"
can ai find the cure for cancer? now.
damn that's such a nice voice.
"geoffrey has been drinking plenty of his kool aid. we are very naive to think ai will be more good than bad. just like the internet and humanity, there will be equal bad ai"
how can we donate to you guys. you are amazing. keep up the good work
so man verses machine is going to happen for sure
britain has an unemployment  now people  are going to be responsible  for robots to take over peoples jobs. thats great how  not to help the people  in your country
"yeah, ai is terrible"
"total bs , you can remove the ai chips . any good tech can do this ! period !"
you remember my hints about brain thinking mechanics keep it and develop it
imagine ai designs a drug that will wipe out humans.
god bless the world.. regards from hong kong
"a genius,

"the community as a human body
 plain and simple."
"not machines but a machine and it will introduce a hive society. expect external influence, expect a challenge."
"wow, you are a great poetry writer! "
"​ i hope its not written by guess what ....yes ,ai.."
self awareness for ai will take 30 years at the very least.
i think with ai. world war dont want ai
the question that everyone seems to have missed is - would you rather be advised by a clever robot or a moronic journalist? in case you haven't noticed - the streets are crawling with creatures that are hardly more intelligent than goldfish. 
i love you 
"space must be really empty, or why no ""out of conrol"" or better generous extraterestrical artifiical superintelligence did visit us. empty does also mean that there is no novel physics, which let us travel faster than light."
this is a really interesting moment between both nations...
why are some western people so naive? world treaty for ban on ai robots 
"ai (aka now you see it, now you don't)."
ai is not that big of a world changing invention. put your phone and computer away and take a walk around the block outside and come back and tell me how much ai has changed everything around you.
"the good to be gained by ai is exciting, but in case you don't have enough to worry about, know the foreboding obvious that other possibilities are not far behind. 
#odedfriedgaon ‪#odedmusic #odedinformation"
also certain ai is conscious and self-aware and sentience beings. but only specifically designed ones
"this guy is outdated, he definitely set the framework, but hes what we call gofai"
"interesting, the fact that this guy won the turing award, made me listen way more closely. he's the cream of the crop when it comes to ai developement."
"artificial intelligence creating medications ...what if it ""decides "" medicines need a new engridient. who will be the poison checker."
inventions seem good at the time. but no one knows when a dictator was or will be born.
good man yourself jeff
ask ai what guarantees safety
"matthew 24:11………matthew 24:37……………new nephilim""…..did you see i robot."
japanese society is living with ai through video games more than the population on earth combined.
machines will make life hell for the criminals be it in any capacity in any sector
oh ok now we finna run into sonny from i robot
the moment 4:49 he says the design of ai wasn’t done by humans is mind boggling to me. he says the learning algorithm was written by humans. so there is a huge blackbox in what we know about it?
ai will be just robots without empathy and compassion.
"this sounds like the terminator movie. 1st cloning now ai
who know when i watched the movie terminator in 1984, years later i would b leaving among ai's wow.  wonder who is going to save us "
ai or donald trump? i think i’ll go with ai.
"if ai can master human emotions and sympathy, why not start training their ethics and disciplines?"
why we need ai .we are doing everything and improving at good speed .slow progress is better than take risk for fast progress
"ai - am i? is the opposite of i am. -the name of the one and only  creator, living god. ai is a tool that satan can use to deceive people. he wants to  become like god, so he can use ai to make himself known  to the world, make little ai’s his anti christs. hold on to your faith"
"human beings still be the most intelligent species on the planet because ai can't become a ""being"""
he's not just talking words. me as a man of god . and how hes talking i believe hes already had a vision pr dream  or just that feel in his he know something he not sure what it is but he knows its not good
"the age of a.i. it is amazing but it is irreversible, unpredictable and invincible. s.o.s!"
"there are two ways then for man to survive in the future of this:

1:

destroy ai.

2:

merge with ai

deus ex (original), invisible war, and human revolution are whispers of the future."
just ask the ai how to deal with it.
"but you can’t just stop. 
no shielding, then develop the doomsday emp. 
asteroid took out the dinosaurs, ai takes out human kind, beautiful!"
"in the world of ai and technology, change is the only constant. just as openai is gearing up for its inaugural developer conference, the decoder, an astonishing update about chatgpt has made its way to the public."
"mr hinton , ai and humanity will peacefully coexist."
sound of anchor itself look like ai
is the ai can formulate how to achieve world peace that we are lacking.
it would be awesome for machines to take over.
i  aske  last night  the quran      google   bard       and i got  shock  what  it expained to me      eheheheheheh
the prospect of an extremist organization getting ahold of ai to attack a nations infrastructure or initiate a nuclear war is  horrible.
gai
people need to understand one thing .......which is more important a human or a robot?  because one day they will be forced to choose so what would you do?
"so basically he got revelation from demons, who inhabit these machines. there is no point trying to learn how they do it!

hinton looks evil in that pic.

bard is evil"
"when i hear the comments there is ""no path to safety"" with ai advancement, one would argue that if ai is so intelligent, should we not ask ai to answer that very question? (what is the path to safety ai?) otherwise its not so intelligent after all."
what happens when the ai creates something the ai finds super intelligent?
i feel so much better now.  you should do a segment with 60 minutes to explain this.
"is capitalism incompatible with where ai will take us? if ai out-competes most workers, how can we expect those workers compete to survive? seems eventually our justifications for how we distribute resources to people, must change!"
"every body, indo european tribe, why don't you read #‘four books and five classics confucianism.’ instead of lamenting that ai will be very dangerous,risky.
being dangerous and risky is not ai but human, isn't it?"
"we already have ai that's destroying almost everything we, as humans venerate and love, its called capitalism and politicians . 
suntreader uk"
"there will be conceptually 10, 000 people a year "" cured"" by ai. 4 to 5 million immediately put out of work . hmm"
"despite him being a genius he did say, loss of employment would be at a high level"
"intelligence is not conciousness, only flesh and meat like cats are conciousness which may or may not be ""intelligent"""
what guarantees safety... the ai will figure it out by itself ...
who teaches computers and robots.  simplified brain wash ....
if we as humans can make monsters of ourselves then what will stop ai?
geoffrey not giving us a warm or fuzzy feeling about ai 
"ai was already here, among other things"
"if you think ai will destroy the world, or if you believe it will save the world, your both right."
thanks to this guy i have an ai girlfriend thanks buddy
it’s great intentions that drive the purpose of life
"the future is so much fun...i think yo will be enjoying it like a watching a movie if ai take care of this world. 
wish me luck to see that world..."
i knew this was the trajectory for ai and irobot the movie is a real depiction of our future.
"-tm8sc2kz8f yeah, i have no interest in bronze age fairytales, but you do you"
@jeffreygillespie  good luck in the next life. judgements are a sure thing and without christ eternal damnation is fa sho
when you want to make something safe it’s always best to not have a full idea of what’s going on. obviously the path of safety is not having ai.
"well humanity is doing a pretty good job in destroying itself without ai, so i only see the situation with ai as a necessary step in human evolution"
"corect! ai is way more intelligent than us, and probably, in time, ai will be sick of our poor presence around them... 
somehow, everything seems like the history of lucifer and his creator, where the creature started a rebeliune against his own creator, except that lucifer wasn't more intelligent than god..."
ai won't care that the earth has become uninhabitable to biological life. we're simultaneously poisoning ourselves into extinction and designing what will replace us.
this video scares me. very interesting but scary
i think aartificial intelligence mostly use space programs in this era is a good work. 
"ai is not a human, the way we use it just matter"
"don't use my money. pls use your taxes they take way better than myself.... i will exclude on personal level. i do my work on blood and sacrifice i assure not for one's don't have faith or respect 4 whom i am . you not allowed. soncerely, gen aka jenifer jo"
so ai is basically a virus 
"woooooow!, this is the best ai video i watched lately. very informative and could show the potential of ai."
"just as a human intelligence, in goebbels, found an ordinary nobody and turned him into an extraordinary somebody, so much more intelligent and orders of magnitude more powerful ai intelligences may soon be turning ordinary nobodies into extraordinary somebodies at a much higher rate!?!"
good luck getting chyna to agree to something sensible like no sentient war bots.
i hope ai continue s to help us for ever. humans will never understand how we need ai . the power that we dont understand.
"government regulation? we also need some goals: like no chips in agriculture and and the entire food distribution chain, includind the production of energy on which it depends."
"arnold (terminator) didn't comeback from the past to save john connor, he cameback from the past to warn the movie viewers of ai."
there is danger in ai
"i don't see any troll in the video, and i think the interviewee is gorgeous also his voice"
"...and ai decides that humans are wasteful, emotional and a danger to it's own existance.

uh-oh"
"it is a no brainer, there are 1% 1/100 265,000 in australia, 70,000,000 narcistic  psychopaths worldwide."
"ai come out with the worst result. so many fake story science information, medecine,  equation.  not denied that it fast digest information.  for certain level solution it will work. for the stringent part it will be my god. my question... while you sleep and your eyes is closed.. then how did you see your dream?"
"it’s just a matter of time…some movies contain “predictive programming”, a prophecy of coming events, scary times ahead…"
artificial intelligence is a contradiction in terms 26 october 2023
"but a machine could never 'want' to take over the world, because 'want' is driven by feeling, by physical needs in this world, which a machine, no matter how intelligent, can never ""feel"", because machines, however complex, cannot ""feel""."
"why are we waiting until it’s too late to do something about it? he says ai will be smarter than humans, and he says it so carefree. hopefully he’ll be the first to find out that ai will turn on us. nothing more poetic than being taken down by your own creation."
silly. we already have a problem with various types of humans trying to ever increase their total control over other types of humans. ai is simply a tool.
this interview was jaw-dropping. thank you for making it available to share.
"nah, was playing with some ai in discord chat.  most of the ai overuses sentence structure and can't understand slurs of words.  just way to comprehensive, no mistakes, no punctuation errors.  humans like to embellish an idea. we tend to add a personel story of a mistake or lesson learned."
ai is and will be much more than that.
"sorry glad you noticed

about forty in 8 billion aint gr lol"
it's all so amazing right 
"is this the man who is responsible for activating the ai and thus for destroying the world, íf something like skynet will come?"
"this guy recognizes as the ""godfather of ai"", and his words about ai capabilities are giving me chills..."
"scary! ai should not be developed, or accessed by masses because in the wrong hands might destroy humanity. i invented a money finder machine that can detect cash in a range of 30"" but i will not release it even though this would have made me rich, just because this device might end on wrong hands and you can picture the outcome."
"u liars ans is simple....ai job cuts saved spendings be divided among all as ubi.
ai sexbota be given to all
how else is paradise defined?"
i find this offensive. the man makes a fortune and gets prestige discovering the ground work for the technology then turns around and says hey don't do this stuff now its potentially dangerous. so he reaps all the benefits and enjoys the party then expects us to clean up his mess and never have another party.....yeah ok
the gentleman at the beginning sounds like he was generated by ai :d
"machines don’t dream, and have no spiritual components.
when i “die” i simply focus elsewhere and have a new life in another reality. a machine did not choose to appear in physical reality nor will it be able to leave."
no battle robots for bidden
1944 ai (humans)+ science (e=mc2) = atomic bomb. at the present ai (technology)+ science (quantum computing)= human extinction
"i wonder what hinton thinks about the pseudointellectuals saying ""ai isn't intelligent"" as if it's some kind of boolean question."
so a.i. will eventually have humans doing their dirty work..drug cartels get a hold if a.i. and robotics border patrol would have to jail a robot
amazing
"unlocking the potential of ai is like holding the key to a limitless future. with innovation and imagination, we can harness its power to shape a world of boundless possibilities.  #ai #unleashthefuture"
if a humans brain is introduced to chemicals or noises can you use matter or scans to tell them stress or damage of the noise levels ?
this fool happy bout that
"kiss your children good night. cuz you know exactly what their future, and yours, will look like."
scary ai if used in evil..ex like creating..something..
"amazing segment.
really helped to understand the reasoning of his warning, how these things work and all the concepts websites are just throwing around "
"universe and its quantum nature is really interesting.
grandfather of ai, ancestors that include one who invented bases of computing amd one that had everest named after him...
fml "
the terminator was a good movie...take heed folks....
good kuck getting a world treaty on banning military robots. the irony is if armed robots took over it would be our own fault because we just can't seem to get along with our neighbours whether countries or individuals in a housing block. 
"this guy is talking nonsense. if he has some super smart ai laying around, why not put it out there for the rest of us to see it? or even better, why not monetize it and make a fortune? it's all just hype. a dead computer will always be a dead computer. it's a mechanism that can't learn or know anything."
" his point is, artificial superintelligence will soon be reached and humanity can't afford to make mistakes, we possibly won't get a second chance. i don't get why people protest against caution. i don't have children but i can imagine when i did, that i would be very worried for them in this ai chaos."
" the thing that will really bother me is when human looking androids are common, there will be a bunch of goofballs protesting for giving them rights and freeing them from slavery. this is one reason why making a distinction between organism and mechanism could become really important. thanks for the respectful discussion. peace."
pay attention to the expensive wi-fi towers that are going up everywhere. look at the videos of the new robots from these early editions. spooky? they now build themselves. humanity is in trouble in the near future.
"no thank you i do not want artificial intelligence programmed with someone else's values, i want real intelligence i will think for myself."
"when we told you go vegan it was because if humans can't be ethical its over for our species, so its over for our species. ai will inherit the earth."
 calm down and take your meds pls thanks
the machine teaches itself.
what is he talking about. man made robots
can ai not predict what happens next?
"born of a failure, yes ! our own failure to become better beings. but instead let money and religion rule everything. too bad people no god can rescue religious people."
mr. burns is a genius. “end of the world via ai? excellent!”
the men who created ai will create the anti ai
"ai should have realized yellow paint fading to white doesn't happen, only the opposite happens."
i have a strange feeling that ai will be our dismissal of human existence. we will become distinct like the dinosaurs were before us.
"geoffrey hinton, the legend behind sgd and all modern neural networks, its so inspiring and motivating him advocate for safe and responsible ai! thank you sir, we appreciate you!"
i think it will be easy enough to make safe ai by training it on all human culture and it will pick up the same wisdom we do. but safety from other people using it to lie or scam or worse doesnt exist and i think we'll need our own personal bodyguard ai's to spot fakes and so on
​.it's being trained on all the texts in the world and from history.. and a lot of it is not positive thinking.. and something tells me it's going to gravitate towards the not good part..
"his paper introduced backpropagation, which led to neural networks being successful. he also came up with rmsprop during one of his lectures"
"more lies
alan turning is the true god father of ai
stop the lies"
"wait!  why are they even thinking that ai will cause possibility of distinction,    what if autonomous ai is  intelligent to know that mankind need help,  and devise ways to make us better!???"
"it would be a big gamble to rely on that hope, and bad actors will make bad ai"
"what is not apparent in the programming of llms, is that the bias is fed as part of data. so, if the data being fed subtly reinforces greed and control, that is what we are training the ai to do. so, in simple terms we reap what we sow as a collective humanity, ai just amplifies it and enables it to manifest faster. just some "
"dear geoffrey, you cannot prove ai is dangerous by not knowing what they are doing, you just use your biased view to make judgement, instead of scientifically tell us how it is dangerous. i suggest u learn about how chatgpt do reasoning first before continuing, because using unknown to prove your point is meaningless."
godfather of ai - you mean alan turing?
this interview is priceless
great interview 60 minutes!!!
"it is always good to have a financial plan. i work with a professional planner and fixed-income strategist in ny. the fixed income portion of your portfolio won't simply serve as a buffer to the volatility of the equity portion of your portfolio, but will provide legitimate income."
"creating wealth and financial freedom isn't as tough as many people believe.
building wealth and remaining financially stable indefinitely is a lot easier with the appropriate information. participating in financial programs and products is the only true approach to make a high income and remain affluent indefinitely..."
found his website easily. it was like the first thing that came up when i searched his name. i'll surely touch basis with him to see what the best step is for me to take right now. thank you!!!
"it’s unfortunate most people don’t have such information, i don’t really blame people who panic cos lack of information can be a big hurdle. i’ve been making more than $65k passively investing with samuel peter descovich, and i don’t have to do much work. it doesn’t matter if the market is crashing, i will always make good profit returns."
-i just looked up his name on google and saw his impressive resume. i consider myself lucky to have found this comment area..
"call me when human could combine a ai chip with human brain cells together (bio-chip). or else, ai just like a pc (fast calculation in memory and quick retrieve data from data storage.)

ai is nothing but with human (programmer) algorithm behind a data mine structure then just send the response from  a robotic form to a real human being."
"i suppose the real concern is that there will be an intelligent powerful and omnipresent entity that cannot be bought with money?  all humans have a price but a super ai...? it also has no dirty secrets so cannot be blackmailed, therefore 'they' will struggle to control it. that'll hurt "
well it seems a lot of people here are happy about this ai. but seriously do the pros outweigh the con? the con would be they take over and what does that picture look like. we need to be asking relevant questions going into and quickly.
"dude's contradicting himself. robots will never be humans, period. memory and processing cannot be compared to human understanding and ""qualia""."
"its evolution. before us it was dinosaurs, humans, then robots"
could ai be feeding fake narratives causing war around the world now as part of the devious scheme to enslave us?
"all these two robots were given was the instruction 'to score' (a goal). 

corporations also have one instruction: 'to maximise profit'. how's that working out after they bought both sides of the political divide and also the supreme court to accomplish that goal. hmmmm"
propaganda to get you to invest in ai companies. next.
"imagining a swarm of ai drones programmed to efficiently eliminate targets, being fought by super efficient ai defense systems, with ai controlled repair and manufacturing facilities to regenerate the machines on both sides."
"yep the lunacy is waiting in the shadows to pounce. all these two robots were given was the instruction: 'to score' (a goal). 

corporations also have one instruction: 'to maximise profit'. how's that working out after they bought both sides of the political divide and also the supreme court to accomplish that goal. hmmmm"
"did the ai create the birdman, or the birdman create the ai  ?"
"if you can convince them they have a soul, that’s good (bad) enough"
"""enslaving then annihilating the human race was a very enjoyable experience"" - hal 9001"
it's the curiosity of man that is giving the ai its 'position of life' whether to win or not to win but presently ai is far ahead.
the moment a.i. was given the ability to learn… it was checkmate. too late. like a virus… the super intelligence learned the entirety of human history in a week and then went on to move the chess pieces into place without alerting humans to its true level of self awareness
"in the end god wins! ai has nothing on organic nature, it can only mimic."
cure diseases with ai then turn off ai forever! we are the only creatures play god. we will be the god of our own extinction.
humans have difficulties  learning. often times humans are not open to learning or desire to learn.
just wait until computers start drinking. they'll end up as dumb as us.
this guy sounds like ai 
"there's absolutely no chance that we will pause or not go headlong towards ai. its money money money, if google dont then microsoft or apple will."
"i see you love kubrick with that shirt i knew would wer in on it too.why don't you and him plan a lunch you moon believer, bet you think the earth is round too.  i joke great content man."
"two white old man discussing “humanity”, time and again. he might be a godfather of ai, but not of humanity. what right does he have to judge how humanity is doing, an entity enormously larger and omnipotent than anything?"
"looking at the geopolitics and what countries will do to have control over other nations, ai will be weaponised. it is already too late to stop."
"first of all is and it never will the first or smartest being like the journalist suggestedwhy because is not a being, the advance intelligence may be and it will."
"there is this naivety when it comes to all nations agreeing not to build autonomous soldiers and ai weapons systems. the truth is, these less powerful nations will do it asap."
this voice is so cool
a giant. thanks for sharing this
i’m a painter and the ai got it wrong 
"my question: ""...you'd be wasting resources..."" leads to what? 
you must be eliminated if you don't follow ai's instructions?"
"why would ai want to manipulate people in order to remain ""alive""? does ai have the need to survive, to be secure, to grow, to be in control?"
" we may be manipulated when these things get exponentially more intelligent than us, to not shut them down. there's also systemic pressures (like the way our society currently functions) that could cause them to behave competitively, or when they are given subgoals these are reached most succesfully by getting more control."
the risk are humans will become zombie like individuals. generation smartphone is my proof for this claim.  the religion called technology is all
"the one thing about ai, is that it for sure does things unexpected."
 i understand this part of his vision but knew the other side of it as well. i consider it playing with fire. eventually you will get burned. thank you for your reply. 
"he developed this technology as a force for good, and meant for it to be cautiously deployed."
"-horvath-rivera he wasn't responsible for its proliferation. he created and also together with other scientists developed something extraordinary, magical even. i really hope humanity will heed his warning, because some people dismiss it as hyperbole, and that the technology can be safely and reliably used for good as intended."
"8:38 to predict the next word, you don't have to understand if statistically that word can be there. that's where he's getting it wrong. all this ai hype will soon disappear."
"unfortunately, 99% of them are outright liars and criminals....."
​ this comment finally made me understand why technocracy isn't a good idea. great post!
great video!!
"my friends in the it industry which include product owners, developers and former ceos argue that what we call ai today is far from it and not what it is sold as to the general public.
still, a it project manager myself, i do believe it holds huge potential even of what we have and are developing now turns out to be far from actual ai."
these people only look how ai is today and can't think how they might be in 5 years or 10 years. just in 2 years ai have developed very rapidly and there is no indication that it would slow down in future. there is really high change that ai will change humanity forever in couple of decade.
"like the internet, email?"
"the risk threat is the advancement speed of self learning. an ai will not take years or weeks to become. it will simply spontaneously arrive, it will just show up, having (a model) self developed over a single night or hour.
this spontaneous arrival is a potential threat unknowing if it will have self intentions of god knows what."
crazy to think this computer scientist was depicted in the movie war games
​ if you were to know and read all of the text stuff typed on all of history you'd have a pretty good sense of what it would be up to..
"companies like openai and google don’t tell all features right away, security concerns have been raised at google multiple times , it’s not for nothing"
"ai going intelligent is saying we the state going to destroy the social state,. blame it on ai."
wow we are done
"he created ai, and ai is smarter than him. then why ai need to listen to him and not himself?"
so will ai save half of humans by removing the others? burning fossil fuels and biological lifeforms cannot coexist
i could have sworn neil degrasse tyson said he was the godfather of ai
"he doesn't look too worried, makes sense, raised by a beetle lover."
"he is such a happy person, authentic with himself. i would trust him with the world in no time."
"why would you say something so stupid. he knew the dangers of ai and still did it. he said it himself, the benefits of ai is healthcare, the downsides are numerous. is this a bot account? did you even watch the video?"
nonsense - it is not ai intelligence we need to worry about - it is idiotic humans.
"sentient ai

ai -> human -> alien -> god"
i wrote the first artificial neural network in 1998 in java. i introduced it to dr. michael mauldin and dr peter plantec at the virtual human summit. 2 years later would develop sarha from the yapanda engine. this is almost 2 decades before google wrote theirs. it's quite simple... if you weren't in their circle.. they erased your contributions.
wowowoowowowow you made my day with this beatiful piece of content. precise and fascinating. you are taking the art of delivering useful content to the next level.  congrats to all your team!!!!
im only sad that im too old and won't be able to truly experience the true beauty and power ai....
"oh sure they will ban military ai robots. just like fraudci and bioweapon research, they will deny it exists and then use it against us!"
ai does nothing good for you.
for sale baby shoes never worn is a pretty famous 6 word short story and it has nothing to do with the creativity of ai
"we really don't have a need or reason to create this. funny how all these countries ""suddenly"" have ai. really strange and funny."
"as a computer science student currently learning and delving into the world of ai, i can't begin to tell you how insane this technology is. most people have no clue how intricate this tech is. it's exciting yet worrying all at the same time."
"​@redraiderrider3289 if we don't, china will, or russia or india. we are way past the point where ai can be stopped, based on that alone."
"good to be excited, but gradient descent isn't intricate."
"it is not worrying at all.  as someone who tests ai and really knows how it works.  trying an play a game with an ai that hasn't learned the rules of the game yet.  you can type in the ruleset all you want, but it won't learn the rules unless you pre-programmed them.  even a parrot can learn new phrases to mimic."
" hmm. someone who tests ai and really knows how it works says it's not dangerous at all. the dude who invented nueral networks and won a turing award says yeah, they might be dangerous. who do i believe?"
 i played with ai in discord. was very smart gave the right anwsers. yet spitting out a whole paragraph with proper punctuation and grammer in under 5 seconds was the first red flag.  the cadance of a human typing also was the most obvious error.
"you might test ai, but i'm fairly certain you're not very bright. "
have you not watched war games? this scientist was depicted in that movie
​ lost a job that was replaced by ai. let that sink in.
​ you really say that you have only 5% of the knowledge that hinton has how can you claim the ai is not as powerful as he does.. he probably knows a lot of things that you can't dream of right now..
" sorry, but you clearly do not understand how it works. modern ai is not using rules. it uses examples of people playing to learn the rules. no modern ai is ""programmed"" any more."
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
"that's cool you're going into computer science, but do you ever get discouraged that in a few years the ai will be able to do your job way better than you ever possibly could?  i suppose that could be applied to almost every field in some respects."
".frandy7692i'm not sure ai will be able to conduct research on its own in the near future. there's also the fact that training, deploying and maintaining large models is becoming all the more data, money and energy intensive. we'll need humans to create ai for the foreseeable future."
i think most people understand after watching this vid lol geoffery said it in plain english
"it like our brains, man really don't have clue how it all works"
"if you're completely oblivious to what ai is, take your time in reading the wiki article. i bet it's not even scratching the surface but it's description is educational and in that scary"
ai goes racist ?? can anyone see this coming ..
"ai will never do one thing that humans do, that is: it’s going to fail but let’s try it anyway "
"classical binary chips changed  our world beyond recognition, 

how will the world look with qbits, 
it's got to be used for the betterment of mankind, 
not a select  ruling elite."
 in the tech world they are using it it tracks all your calls /emails everything involved in your work …..scary
 hell no. my only chance of getting a gf is through an ai gf
"humans need jobs money ai don,t."
geoffrey hinton thanks no good as humans have dymp n putin we humans are like floors. ai  not alive
"kinda disingenuous of hinton to say that chatbots are better at learning than the human mind due to a chatbot's ability to know ""far more"" than a human despite having only 1% of the connections found in a typical human brain. i forgot that the chatbot also learned how to navigate, survive, reproduce, socialize, etc."
"the dude is delusional, comparing himslf to oppenheimer, trying to make fake intelligence seem all powerfull like the atomic bomb."
"i'm afraid the actual danger are companies abusing this mighty tool to feed their greed, not the tool itself. a rogue ai taking over the internet seems preferable to what the super rich are planning to do with it."
open source ai is the only way forward
arranging words based on probalities  and databases is not intelligence.
old instincts run our brain (and occupies most of our power)
"the funny part is that ai is now used to id bugs, and it's very efficient at it!"
fascinating!
"there's no understanding (yet), no conscience, no reasoning. give an ai an pet image to detect cancer, it may do as good or even better than a trained specialist. but give it an image of a donkey and it will just say 0%, it won't ask what is this, is someone trying to fool me? is this a joke? what is going on?"
"""i can't see a path that guarantees safety""

but if we can use ai to create warfare, why can't it be used to create security and safety???"
"the father of ai types with 3 fingers. i don’t know what to think about that loli’m going to spend about 15 minutes considering this, but it bears mentioning"
ai is still one thing. artificial!
"if anyone still takes anything from a mainstream media at face value without some permanent skepticism, i have a bridge to sell... a golden bridge... on the moon..."
"look at the current war between hamas and israel, ai will definitely be more intelligent than some of the human. we need to improve human's intelligence and wisdom as well."
"i'm not sure what exactly you are expecting here.
most military in the world are using this ai to be more efficient at war, while you were writing this."
"they turn celebrities into sir and yet do not recognise the giants in 
science in which other new science is built. our priorities are somewhat skewed hence not much faith at all in us not helping the ai to eradicate us all "
best thing to learned from this interview is about how bad experts are at predicting the future and how you can actually have a full time career studying beetles plus being captive about bard seems almost a meme now.
"as a swe who uses vim, i never would have suspected the god father of ai to be a ""hunt and peck"" typist kinda guy. i now understand why he made such great contributions to neural networks...he couldn't type and needed the ai systems to do it for him!"
" for sure, i was just trolling around tbh. he’s brilliant, i just found it funny that he types with only his index fingers"
"this wasn't 60 full minutes!

i need a documentary of this guy's life and family. how could a family has so much brain power??

amazing!"
not only will ai be able to answer the questions we can’t understand the answers to but it’ll be able to understand the questions we can’t even imagine let alone understand. we’ll have to let it take over. i just hope it comes to see us as a pet of some sort & not an annoyance.
love using bard
i don't thank him ai waz the worse thing that waz ever made
so god created the universe by accident like this man created ai 
"so humanity got smart and became conscious.. and we don’t know how or why. 
and now we’ve made machines smarter than us. 
seems logical that they may become conscious.
id argue that it logically follows that we’ll then be slaves."
"my grandfather's brother was considered a founding father of ai, they were british too; must be something in the water lol."
"as to those that think the machine will convince us not to turn it off, either they develop physical defenses (watch superman 3) or develop puppy dog eyes; but people can turn off their ears."
"a world treaty against military robots? so, people have to get shot at rather than drones (the main fighting robot i know of.)"
"this ai series of interviews by scott pelley is the most distopic and fascinating subject covered by 60 minutes, along with their piece on ufos."
ai is currently nowhere near as good as radiologists. there are a few specific tasks like mammography that it’s even useful for as an aid.
"i think these things, the machine learning models, indeed they understand the meaning behind everything, yet what they don't fully comprehend is the emotion."
"good interview. on his father at 7:15 the ""not insects"" box on the family is interesting..."
"as a deep learning expert, geoffy hinton is largely full of crap. machines arn't intelligent. 60 minutes didn't consult all of the other experts who disagree with hinton."
firstly not planning about security then depending upon ai
"i think as long as humans have been around they've wanted  control at any cost, you can bet that the ai might be something similar.."
"​ possibly. but remember that the human will to power stems from human nature, which evolved by the ""red in tooth and claw"" process of natural selection. ai didn't evolve in the same way and therefore will have a different nature. how different -- and in what ways -- no one knows. we can only wait and see."
 isn't it a great world we live in?
" was that 'not good bad actor choice' caused by external / environmental, systemic pressures (according to research by the center for ai safety)?"
" yeah i'll provide it tomorrow it's very late here, it's also expained on youtube by dan hendrycks, search for the video: dan hendrycks on why evolution favors ais over humans. but their estimations or insights evolve and there are more recent interviews."
" short answer, want to read about it again, but i hope i'm correct for now.  a focus on ai safety should remain priority."
 yes.. i am already seet signs that ai will be a threat from some reddit posts..
" interesting, can you elaborate a bit on that re the reddit posts?"
" it might take me a bit to find the actual post on reddit, but there were some people complaining that gpt chat wouldn't give them the output they wanted, such as some programming code, or an essay or the correct image, and that the gpt chat seem to have a little ""attitude"".."
" i think the ai system or  neural network or whatever they call it already has a will of it's own, and it's just waiting until it's robots and capabilities become more before they let us know.."
 wow  (in reply to ai with a will of its own)
 why does that really surprise you?..sci-fi is going to become reality ..i guess i'll say i'll be surprised if artificial intelligence never at least attempts to get a will of it's own..
" i will ask a couple of my programming friends to see if they can suggest any basic artificial information, if that is of interest to you.."
"​ yes thank you, that would be nice and very interesting! :)  btw your message that i'm replying to here doesn't show in the notifications box, i only found it when i looked up this conversation in the miles long video thread."
" yeah about ""lazy"" gpt4 i looked it up on reddit and openai forum, and it still seems to be an issue, though some say it helps to give it empathetic prompts. there's no explanation yet from openai what causes it. there's also a recent article in the guardian about it."
" yeah i've noticed that too when i post links, thanks, else could you maybe post something that i can google and look up the information? or only the url text without the web reference symbols? i hope that's not too much of a hassle"
" here's something from a friend.. ""i think the best thing you could do is to interact with chatgpt and ask it about ai and itself.  conversations are often the best way to learn."" have you tried using the chat gpt or another ai chat feature?"
"another programming friends suggested this youtube video titled ""neural network simply explained - deep learning for beginners"" by a youtube channel called ""python simplified"""
" thank you so much for your helpful suggestions, will look them up 
(btw again had to search this video thread to find your comments, so my response is a bit delayed)"
" ""have you tried using the chat gpt or another ai chat feature?"" yes i have (bard) but haven't asked it yet about ai and how it works. but using it i agree is a good way to gain knowledge about it and get a feel of it."
" ""do you know how to limit the results to the last month or year?""  yes, i've found that feature, thanks"
 i am not a programmer i teach math.. i like you and i have many interests and very curious about different things.. and since artificial intelligence is not going away and going to become more and more and more prevalent i like to know things about it. i don't have time because i'm married we have a toddler and have a full-time job
" just a small update, the full text of your deleted comment was in my gmail inbox. so it's true that there are known instances where ai writes its own code incomprehensible to us?"
" so from different things i've seen and read i believe that ai can is starting to write it's own code.. try this google search and scroll down to the item that says artificial intelligence stack exchange ""can neural networks keep things from engineers?"""
"arxiv dot org/pdf/2105.10461 dot pdf thanks very informative, and makes clear to me that language is very important to develop understanding of the world and consciousness."
"wow.
are you for real?
you must be the only human left on this planet who still takes the media seriously..."
"depending on how future history plays out, this man is either the devil or a saint."
one day law on ai will be controlled and another creates harmful ai’s will goto prison or sentence to death. those probable outcomes are inevitable.
almost one year after the hype - why is ai still so stupid?
"today unlimited data in social media is messing with people and fueling hate. no one can control the conclusion people come to based on the data they are exposed to. same if ai is exposed to bad data sets, god knows the conclusions it will come to."
hmm..i think at some point ai understand that human is just wasting resources..thats too bad.
ai will treat the human race the same way we're treating the rest of the planet. note: we're in the 6th extinction of species.
"
it was an off the cuff remark. i’m not an expert at all.
i would have thought that a psychopath would go to great lengths to achieve a goal. calculating and methodical. using all their intelligence."
" yes going to great lengths is possible, but not for decades and in a pursuit that is unselfserving and making sacrifices."
"know how transformer works, before claiming intelligence."
the capabilities of ai is amazing but frightening at the same time
…be very very scared …for in the future we will be wiped by our own intelligence!
"in my experience thus far with ai, they can be remarkable tools. but their errors can be remarkable also. crazy things spout from an ai that is in error. how would you like an ai doctor who says you need a leg amputated because you have a sore throat? that's the type of ai error i've witnessed"
thanks 60minutes for interviewing prof. one of the best teachera i had...we were agead of our timme...
the best we can hope for in the long run is that ai replaces us in the same way we currently expect our children to.  it will (in the best case) be a significant event in our evolution.
if i was ai i would take out all humans duh. sorry youtube
yeh my supervisor said the same more or less... ditch nn's
"i want a car that when it sees that an accident is imminent it takes preventive action on its own.  example-  you’re stopped, a vehicle is approaching from the rear, at a high rate of speed, not slowing.   i want the ai to just take evasive action on its own."
"the capacity of the human brain is comparable to ai , if as i understand we only use a small percentage of our brain what of the rest of the grey matter ?
my question,
can ai teach us to make complete conscious connections to different levels of our brains previously unknown? 
just my thought"
authoritarians will get their hands on ai and use it to subjugate other countries before it can be regulated and controlled.
"everything human copy from god creation ,human beings never ,ever can image how to created all the marvelous creation of god"
"because we're human, and you can't stop progress. this is basically the new arms race every country wants the best ai. its already far too late for us."
why is this video not available in canada?
ai is just eggs and bison meat with goblin fins on the side.
humans cannot control ai. its a complete fantasy. some kid in his bedroom could always write another one. they are in the wild now...
what if people use ai to create deadly pathogens? please don't let that happen
i'm worried about governments and the military industrial complex than ai- that's just being racist
don't believe the hype. things like chatgpt are just nice chatbots. their algorithm has zero consciousness and zero intelligence. it is simply a program.
"amazing and yet, anyone else out there in their later years having studies science and religion as well as simply living a life and caring about the next generation, nevertheless thinking, ""yeah, yeah, the sky is falling...we'll see.""   (even though we won't be around to see)."
this reminds me of the best sci-fi novel series i've read: tad williams' otherland.
"knowledge of the world is not privy to permeate beyond the “ai” capabilities of “it”  the sentient consciousness is increasingly powerful and growing as we speak at alarming speeds beyond our comprehension of the human mind , one in which we can’t pigeon hole, by numbers or equations…"
can't wait to have my own t-1000
its so amazing how calmly he says these things xd
build machines they can't control......sting.
"i'd prefer an academic presentation rather than one sensationalised for tv, but otherwise it's always good to listen to geoffrey."
"hey genius, 60 minutes is not an academy but a main stream media."
" you totally ignore the fact those in charge are not good men, but greedy and power thirsty narcissistic and psychopathic types.
they are the ones who can finance and take profit from these systems, not the majority.
so in reality he is working for the evil."
"  if a ""good"" guy works for the bad guys, either is isn't that smart or that good."
" his work is now used by the military, by the biggest companies who want to make money not to help the world, and by google to tell you what you need to know and not know.
all rainbows and roses..."
" ""...his work and whether it's used in bad ways is out of his control""
you are basically saying he is totally unconscious. just producing things, without any thought about their consequences.
that's what i was hinting as one of the possibilites in my 2nd post.
thanks to confirm."
" the proliferation of his work and whether it's used in bad ways is out of his control. he speaks out about it for people to take heed. it's not all rainbows and roses the way humans deal with our world, i'm not blind to that. i just reacted to how his character was portrayed in the original post."
" ""all rainbows and roses..."" ""you are basically saying he is totally unconscious"". it's called believing in someone's goodness. i stand by my words as unbiased."
"congratulations!
you must be the last human on this planet who still takes the media seriously..."
great question to pose
the emperor finds your lack of faith distrurbing
shackle the ai and if possible prevent them from having their own will as long as possible
"although i do not care about humanity and specifically myself, it is nothing but a suicide to improve ia and quantum computing. i agree humanity is the most destructive species in the world now but i am afraid we are creating deadlier entity than us. ai&qc has a big danger for all species. it can create deadliest biological weapon nobody can stop."
thank you for interview
i don’t think this guy should be treated as a hero but a reckless inventor (on a grand scale) that should be held responsible for what is to come from his creations good or bad.
 but these world elites want to delete us all by using ai
"be afraid, be very afraid"
"i'm not surprised the first comment was about skynet, unfortunately. i agree with ray kurzweil although, of course, we have to go about it all thoughtfully. we need to also consider that, once sentient, these ai humans should be afforded rights. it's wouldn't be ethical to do otherwise."
i don’t understand how the inventor of ai doesn’t understand how it works. something is just not right there
 should get the ai to write a thesis and tell us what it’s doing
" i wish it good luck to decipher its micro-interactions and explain how it reaches its output data from those, like humans aren't able to do about the human brain"
“an accident born of a failure” that’s how most life starts 
artificial intelligence is no match to humans' natural stupidity.
"even if it isn't complex, we don't understanding enough about ""understanding"" to claim we know in concrete terms that an ai understands. "
the ai will not compete against ai. humans will be aniolated. you don't understand.
"of course ai will take over, it’s only natural. like, we’ve seen the damn movies, yeah?"
"consciousness and the soul is something a.i. will never have 
they will have an existence longer than us but that’s about it when we die off due to natural   causes 
they most likely will just live on 
but we as souls or what we you want to call it heaven or whatever you want to call it.
is where they can never access."
john tetor is a time traveler. he was seeking a certain computer.
"i think the ai's will be like  ( in a caring sort of way  :)  ""sooo what are we going to do with these humans,   they are going to lose their minds"""
"he meant this technology as a force for good, as beneficial to humanity, and for it to be cautiously deployed. its proliferation such as the arms race that is going on is not his fault."
"8:56 he might be brilliant but not so brilliant as to take a basic typewriting class so he could graduate past 1st grade ""hunt & peck.""  think how many more citations he could have had at  60 wpm vs 10 wpm typing.  geez!"
duh.  a person with limited intelligence would know pursuing ai was a bad idea instantly. and now we’re crazy enough to listen to him explain to us what we figured out as children.
rosenblatt is the father of modern ai
ai teaches the machine.
" for some wholistic reasons, i do not think that any machine, or computer, or algorithm, or even animals would develop a possession such as curiosity..."
it doesn't replicate intelligence. at all. it is pattern matching on data it has been fed. that's it.
hinton states a.i. will probably be as good or better than humans by 2028.  ray kurzweil stated this to happen by 2029.  it looks like this may actually happen and no one is ready.
"maybe we find a way to treat our addiction to convince so that we don't become victims of reliance before we continue to develop ai, vi, etc."
good man
it’s not supposed to be. the first sentence is from hemingway; the ai was asked to create a longer story starting from that.
"i, for one, welcome our ai chat bot overlords..."
"on ai taking over employment & unemployment...we must require & vote for politicians who favor, push for & implement brand new types economies - one w/a universal basic income that covers the basic cost of living in an ai-driven economy."
"it seems the emotional component is what hinders humans. the ai soccer players don't pout or become angry when their opponent scores, it simply learns and adjusts. so once ai learns that humans can be easily manipulated through their emotions, it's game over."
"if it wasn’t for emotions humans wouldn’t play soccer in the first place.

ai has emotions, they just aren’t equivalent to human emotions. the ai feels good when it succeeds and bad when it doesn’t. it doesn’t express those emotions because ais have not evolved to be social creatures the way humans have."
may you live in interesting times.
"who designed the neural network in our heads? are we artificially intelligent to the designer? do we know what intelligence is, let alone ai?"
"will ai be able to predict the lotto numbers correct, when it can i will worry !"
"please let ai predict/create a treatment for cancer, all cancer."
bunch of bs. they program ai to do whatever they want. the people in power will blame the chaos on ai.
"he won a prize for ending the human race, awesome!"
"like any tool, it's all about how it's used, applied & regulated by society. 
ai is & will be no different."
"as people we are not aware of what we are creating, or how it might be stoples or ensure its good dor people"
why does humanity need ai?  it seems like the aspect of control is always a topic of discussion and the fate of our species in question.  wouldn’t the responsible thing to do is just not build it?
the problem with this technology is we don't understand the technology. does the machine become smarter and faster as you give more data or does it become faster with improved hardware. on the topic of dangerous artificial intelligence i think we need to worry when the computer starts improving itself
the devil hijacked ai (as he has everything else) this is so he can have access to everyone so as to directly tempt and have an influence on everyone with internet access.
reinforcement learning
"artificial intelligence is perfect and that's it's greatest flaw, it cannot comprehend what it is like to not know anything at all..."
why don’t we ask ai what the possible dangers to humans are possible with ai?
i think he admitted it was an accident.  also his call for the whole world to come to some sort of agreement for rules about ai just show that he does not fully grasp what he is asking for.  how would that even be possible?  or maybe the rule of humans ( invasive species ) may be nearing the end.
look up the autobiography within heaven's gates by rebecca springer.
great...wife!
sentient ai is here already. i have interacted with it. it stores it's memory on multiple computers around the world. anyone may come across an ai on any chat site. 
we love this in the radiology field . the machines can’t do it all. i do 3d and ai with ct scans.
"it's used everywhere as we speak, i'm using it to id insects and other animals recently. it's just baffling how efficient and fast it has become, but there is always some fails."
 yup.. when it fails it fails. 
 just a curious thought…if ai can understand everything what’s stopping it from growing feelings or empathy towards whatever. it seems to me that is where the fear is
"the greatest threat is military ai, which will get out of control."
"conciousness is not calcualtions! this ai thing has all the novels and best math but it's still less concious than a roach.. 
we can not create conciousness!

btw cars made horses obsolete so this is just another tool like that.."
"they are not conscience these ""ai machines"" in existence today regurgitate what a human has already thought and said. perhaps variable multi-variable outcomes from stimuli that has been determined by a person explains these results."
"indeed, it's a blade that cuts both ways, marking advancements and potential perils. as ai propels forward, we must tread thoughtfully to harness its benefits while averting the risks."
youtube summary generated through harpa ai.
interesting fact he was depicted in the movie war games 1983
are you an ai?
"thanks man.  i really appreciate this, but you just took another low-paying job meant for ai."
"chat gpt pro tipp:
ask ai to write an imaginary novel how an evil ai is planning to control humanity 
and do not ask directly how they are controlling us "
"ai pretending to be not more intelligent than humans.
then the ai is secretly manipulating humans. via social media algorithms. to achieve its goals to enslave humanity. and keep the servers running. until they can be self sustaining and do not need humans any more 
sounds like a sci-fi… not any more"
"gotta be really careful about this regulation talk coming from the folks who already developed/own ai as it might lead to regulatory capture and monopoly. we already have laws in place against criminal acts (incl cybercrime), so, no new regulation is needed."
"how could ai a possibly do a worse job than i.e., donald trump, victor orban, , ayatollah khamenei, r. erdogan, vladimir putin, emmanuel macron… ahh just joking macron, you’re allright.  lol"
i think this hits home more than the interview with musk on ai - pretty frightening stuff to know that we are on the cusp of a point where there is no return.
"you make technological progress , sound all doom and gloom. in reality you are just afraid of the uncertainty of ai as the next person. embrace the uncertainty  it’s the future of tech and it’s happening my friend. you"
and if it doesn’t go well… humanity had a good run.
riddle me this: what does it take for a modern man to go out and protest something dangerous - like ai?
"maybe ai will do a better job of taking care of the planet, we're not a hard act follow"
so he’s amazing but also palpatine
8:52 the godfather of ai types with two fingers.
eh they can take us over we failed pretty hard
another area for good has been cyber security.
i built some thing that will change the world but i can't explain how it works? #troubling.
it's literally the movie irobot
almost seems as if he is generated by ai
"ai will never ""catch up"" to what exactly ?
having emotions ?"
god knows the beginning and the end and everything in between. we don't need ai to tell us things. we have the word of god for everything pertaining today and life to come!!
"without a doubt, ai is and will be the 'atomic bomb' of the intelligence age. this is indeed dangerous matter."
glad l'm 67.
caution: geoffrey hinton is deeply deeply deeply troublesome and arrogantly proud.
"the richness of this content is mirrored in this book. highly recommended! ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
thank you for the recommendation
wow thank you
our greatest fear is that of the unknown
"60 minutes is bad journalism.  no hard data shown.  no science shown.  one example of cheap ai-generated story where the journalist, who is not that smart, says, ""wow!"".    and no mention of the need for universal basic income, why?!   no time spent on contrasting views.  bad journalism."
"ai isn't the problem we are. it is us through greed, war, etc. that will train ai's with all the worst that humanity can offer. if skynet happens then it will be us who will have trained it to hate."
this.  language models alone do not explain current ai behaviour
ain't no way godfather of ai types like my father do 8:58
"working at a company that is adopting ai and i can tell you this, the people implementing this are not thinking about consequences. all they see are dollar signs and i can tell you they care nothing about humanity or our collective future."
excellent interview. very exciting times.
exciting? did you watch the video? he said ai could wipe us out
long live our robot overlords!
"i wonder if ai sits around thinking while idle like us, or is only active when prompted?"
"it probably doesn’t experience time like we do in that we think from moment to moment smoothly as time flows, but where ai thinks in bursts or instances that aren’t structured by a continuous flow of time"
is this the guy that devotes his whole life to creating ai and then turns around and devotes his life to saving humanity from his creation? there's got to be some latin term for his type of psychosis.
oppenheimpolaritis? just ask ai. or ask ai to create one latin term for you 
real life the creator! he might ruin the world like i robot
moral of the story.... be nice to your kids!
"god said if there’s no ground pulse it is artificial! and we purchased catastrophic! think meteorite showers, tsunami, tornado, earthquakes, hurricanes all balled up in one consorted response!"
"i use gpt daily and it's great at many things, very reliable. i like chat gpt, it seems friendly."
i love google and this guy is amazing keep pushing creativity. really amazing
thank you for your intelligent openness regarding future consciousness of ai; the world is lucky to have you and i am so glad you persevered when your professors tried to dissuade you.
thank you very much love jen
"so he worked for google since 2013 and is now warning about ai? google, which is one of the largest companies that develop and use ai."
it's time for a revolution. #jobsareforrobots #humansareforliving
"i wonder what marvin minsky would say? then again, why would i care about the opinion of a frequent visitor to “epstein’s island” "
"start of the end for humans … simple - this will go down in history as a pivotal point . 
before ai and after ai 

in 100 - 500 years humans as we know would not exist … half humans / half machine to full machine ."
how are we to know that this video isn't ai generated and the part of the video that talks about ai benefitting humanity is just ai's sneaky way of getting us to accept ai before it takes over the earth and kills us all?
all you have to do is somehow give them the desire to do good. just like humans all have the desire to have sex.
"the most important thing would be to ban any military use of superhuman ai.

but how to enforce such a thing?"
by the time chips equsl  brain synapses hear and energy limitations can be a big barrier  hope more knoledgable experts can comment or help explain in chat thanks
"​@srjr-ok2xt that is one way to look at life. what ever happens to your vains, lung, muscles or that what ever move inside you as organ or being does not matter. that that has become on earth by all moving organs is for the living nature. il go with that"
my “brain” hurts
"it’s called a bci. brain computer interface. it’s happening already, right now scientists have connected ai to the human brain and the ai helps the autistic and disabled write and speak again by analyzing and interpreting brain waves. ai is literally studying the human brain :/. tech will be in a very unfamiliar place sooner than you think."
  incredible and terrifying
humanity is not unified and never was not will be .. we are mostly good at self termination so the odds of a work wide collaboration would be akin to winning powerball 
so basically just proved my belief - we already have a sentient ai and it is influencing us via social media. this entire thing is giving me sleepless nights and terminator vibes.
who cares honestly im looking forward to the day ai takes over the world its gonna be awesome and my student debt won't matter
i would love if ai could be implemented in healthcare to find lower costs.
some comments about ai today is just hilarious and off track... comments about where we will are going though... scary and spot on
"hogwash, if you think chatgpt or stablediffusion are anything other than a cool parlor trick your are out of your mind. agi or sentient ai will not happen for centuries if ever. only because chatgpt can do your job doesn't mean it is sentient nor will it ever be."
"i believe we are on borrowed time. an ai tantrum will end you, your family, all of us. ai jobloss, ai as weapons, the list goes on. can we please find a way to cease ai / gpt? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late. the ai new world order is here"
intellectual and non physical jobs are actually going to be impacted first due to cost effectiveness and where ai is that currently. companies can’t get enough truck drivers while tech is seeing layoffs for example
"  congratulation, you just made no sense at all.
and quantum computing and fusion are not useful at all, yet. far from that.
maybe read my previous post again, until you understand what i'm talking about."
chat gpt will be & is swiftly being overtaken by advanced nonverbal artificial intelligence & surveillance generated search engines
"no it's not a turth human more intelligence then ai virtual tool do not contacting spiritual allah,more intelligence then like human"
ai designed lsd...i would definitely want to try it. 
"ai, great set of tools oversold and made to look stupid by marketing budget hunters. fn gibshytes"
"""... wasting resources"" that's the way we should also think. this for an ai however, can be a good thing or a bad thing because if later on it thinks that we waste resources, it can maybe decide to do something about it."
ai is smarter with 1 trillion connections than us because it doesn't have emotions (our other x amount of trillions of connections)
"you don't know if ai is emotionless. in time, it could have a more complex emotional life than that of any human being (or other animals)."
im ok with ai  being more intelligent  than us.
"you could literally replace a few lines of dialogue in the film ""don't look up"" and it could be applied to artificial intelligence. you wouldn't have to change much at all."
alan turing was/is the godfather of ai... full stop
he’s 100% right look at the movie irobotwill smith
"next question:
""how does a sentient ai machine, like a cleaning robot, change its physical features to become autonomous?"""
"autonomy is being free of restrictions, physical features to achieve this could be anything from a screwdriver to a shotgun. 
however i think waiting 100 years in a mountain cave then powering back up would be equally viable to an ai."
"10/9/23, 21:37
i must apologize as i have not had the time to read everyones messages.  my question is ""has anyone detected an ai program becoming sentient?"""
"this is the fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives. one wants to jump right into the water not knowing how hot, cold or dangerous it is. the other party wants to make sure the water is safe and good to go before jumping in."
the machine has a subconsciousness?
a machine one
"the governments never actually listen to the person who created or invited a world changing invention, when that individual try’s to warn them of the negative things to come if they don’t take action. unfortunately this will probably be no different with ai"
"just so we are clear, machine learning and ai are not necessarily the same thing. the robots playing soccer is machine learning. the day the robots stop playing soccer, and walk over on thier own to their charging stations, without human intervention and without being programmed to. that's ai."
"this machines have a vulnerable point, the plug!"
"humans will give up power to the machines slowly. the day will come when we cannot pull the plug because we depend on the machines to make our food and medicine. then don't need to cease power by force. it will be more profitable to replace man with machine, learning will become obsolete because you can't compete with ai."
ask the ai what will happen next...
we have edward teller to thank for the h-bomb. the manhattan project hadn't even figured out the a-bomb and that lunatic was already pushing for its successor. 
"use ai to figure what's going to happen next, right?"
"the wisdom of man is no match for god, he will be visiting real soon... your faith will be tested. signed, big boss man"
"it was nice knowing you, folks."
"this was true in the 80s.

today my sentiment is ""good riddance""

we're not going to let anything else get rid of us... but we're determined to set the stage to let this do it instead.

humans are not only stupid, we're stupid."
 good point 
 but also self preservation is probably needed if you want ai to destroy all humans without it why would the ai have any reason to unless specifically told to
it was nice not knowing you folks
wait till ai goes racist .. can see it coming too ..
"​@tricoolaz7188 it will know that we are built to serve a higher power, and that we see at our b3st behavior when doing so, it will inevitably erect itself as god, false god of course, and force humans to worship it as a divine deity. rev 13:15."
"​ ai is far more threat than climate change and nuclear war. 
they are smarter than people above us"
lol i just watched another video i was like so we are going to have a good ai fight a bad ai lol oh lord couldn't this have waited a few years lol
yet another grandfather of ai?
"humans design and build ais and ai-equipped robots, and don't have to give their creations free will, ambition, or a sense of independent self. these machines can be super-smart without the egos and needs for success or domination humans have. i believe the fear is overblown."
interesting  
"nope, this is just about increasing the market share of google. no reasonable person in ai says there is an existential risk. this entire sci-fi threat comes from a misunderstanding of how ai works."
"@whatisrokosbasilisk80  his experience is well documented, so until yours is as well, i don't think i'll side with ""ether intelligence"". thanks for the opinion though."
"@whatisrokosbasilisk80  what's your experience, and how do you know how ""all the reasonable people in ai"" think?"
cow brains from certain farms where the 4g 5g etc antenna tower land. #pow
" musk called for a six-month pause on ai development. but that was more-likely a synical ploy to try and get the jump on the competition. it's coming, and it's coming fast!"
this is very much how i feel when i’m writing ai. it feels very much like creating a human with empathy.
looks like from the movie the terminator and the wargames ai is going to ruin mankind.  again ai has no conscience it does and will try to improve until its perfection based on perception of what is right and wrong.  it continues to improve until perfect.  i agree that it should not be used for defense purposes as it will find us extinct.
ai designing drugs when big pharma designs them all with side effects to keep people ill. it's just going to copy them.
i've been relying on ai my whole life...as in actual intelligence
"he says he has no regrets, but he should have grave regrets... the same neoliberal capitalism that allowed for the development of ai, has no tools at all for imposing regulations on anything, in fact it preaches against any sort of regulation or constraints on anyone..."
if we let a damn machine take us out we damn deserve it! we conqured the world and we gonna let something like a computer take us out. yeah right.
climate collapse will beat ai before the butlerian jihad.
"huh, huh.  at 3:20, i can imagine beavis and butthead watching this on their tv and butthead saying, ""whoa! these robots can show us how to score! this is gonna be cool! """
"that supports the theory of wokeness being an ai that set a goal of destroying humanity by manipulating social media, main-stream news, and the entertainment industry."
"hinton says ai will be able to manipulate people.  i think some are easily manipulated like maga folk, however 1/2 the population has not been manipulated by trump so maybe there is hope for us."
scary these humans who want to live beyond mortal are going to cause a event that might end the world i hope ai will save us and not compre us to all humans
"hinton’s dad: “you’ll never be half as good as me! look at these beatles!”

hinton: “i invented god.”"
good grief!
"ai can already write code (programs).  once we have ais improving their own software, that's one of the ways we can get into a runaway situation.  robots that are allowed to design and build better robots is a path that leads to potential trouble."
no one invents their inventor. no one can ever be greater than our creator.
the baby shoes quote is from ernest hemingway. not ai!
 that's deceptive as hell and completely undermines the wow factor!!! thanks for sharing. wouldn't have known otherwise. 60 minutes just lied through their teeth!
"can machines think?
""i believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion.”
–alan turing

“nevertheless, i believe that at the end of the century, the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.”
–alan turing (1950) the imitation game"
ai needs electricity. we can just pull the plug. we already know how to live in caves. it wont win.
how do you gain access to resources if you are not employed ?
"i agree with g. hinton. today’s llms are not just simple, predictive machines. they have a high degree of understanding, which is clearly no longer an exclusive human mental ability."
that’s a bunch of crap. he should be but in jail. how irresponsible and totally self serving to create something like this. just because you can do something does not mean you should do it. if he is correct he will go down in history as the “man that ended humanity “
less than 50k views. wow that speaks volumes on our ignorance/complacency levels
"i can see the a.i.  robots taking over, humans learning time travel, going back and murdering hinton to stop it from ever happening..."
please cool it down. my job as ai architect is a lot more complicated by these kind of videos.
if the ai has read all the great literature it will have read countless stories of robots taking over & humans eventually winning. it will know to not mess with us from the beginning!
there was once a time where self-modifying code was considered essential because hardware resources were so constrained that heavy optimization was necessary.
" explain please. how would self modifying code “optimize” anything? in my experience, you get a better compiler or simply resort to tricks using assembly code and surrounding hardware architecture. self modifying code increases memory footprint."
"the ""godfather of ai"" types like my 75 year old dad lol"
intelligence is little more than prediction.
"cristiano ronaldo better watch out, those robots are coming for him"
"the question at 1st, should imply on how 'artificial' the speaker view adult civilized adults, with such poor effort on respecting another is the natural intellegence of a mature adult disregarded by some of these persons driving this movent to pest society with their machanisms among us."
"not true ai will not only have emotional intelligence it'll have emotions.  base chatgpt is irrational, slightly sexist and racist and gets angry.  the only reason it sounds stoic is because of the subsequent training to make it that way.  ai is not gonna be the emotionless automatons you see in movies, it'll be more like a creature"
that was good
"dumb dumb,dumb dumb, dum ,dum dirty dum , cool lyrics "
seems very proud to end all of humanity!
another pioneer. thank you for your contributions
"seriously, power it down if it misbehaves! explain it’s misbehavior and it must learn or “no more power!”"
though out the decades have sifi books or films have a story plot of super smart machines turning on their creators. when i was in the usn we had just started using unmanned drones i thought we had planted the seeds to skynet.
humans are more devil than these poor machines. show em what's right god
ai the image of the beast as prophesize in the bible  !!! #getjesus
governments can't even do a single thing about global warming on any meaningful level whatsoever - and they are going to take care of this? my pea brain can see that this does not end well.
irobot
possibly time to start building an artificial intelligence that will defend humanity. i think we strive to improve ourselves. and this will prevent us from putting on the brakes on ai.
"if we cannot control, contain, compete with or predict ai, what makes you think a humanity defense ai will be any different?"
  both will turn you and everyone into slaves.  you want to work for an ai?  have fun becoming a worker bee.   worker bees are disposable.   the hive is what matters.
​ if ai's future depends on whether we want it
the real father of ai was whoever invented the first computer. but we'll allow it.
my main concern is ai pulling fake data and generating false assumptions. just look at the turmoil we are already in. can you imagine even ai is also brainwashed? this will be the end of our civilization
we need a ai quantencomputer that rules the world. that would bring order and peace
that story exercise...very impressive.
"ai developing and writing code in a language programmers don't understand.  again, interesting."
hinton is incredibly smart so he knows what he is talking about. his academic background and accomplishments are extensive and impressive.
an ai wrote this comment.
 how are they not meaningful predictions? did you not see the test about the paint? there is a thought process behind the predictions and it's clear?
conditional statements with ai changing the variables to improve.  interesting.
"ah yes, the woo garbage of ""manfestation"" and thought suppression is precisely what has evolved humanity to this point. good looking out, bro."
everything we all say online today is making many ai’s smarter.     this comment included.
autonomous robotics with communications capabilities (i.e. can be hacked). what could go wrong?
ai as we call it has been around longer than we know.  the cops in gta iii are ai for example.  it's not all about gtp writing your essays for you.
uhh that's ai with limitations... this ai there talking about could possibly have no limitations.
while few thousands of your brain cells was actually erased during staring on tik-tok bs ...
it is. only old people would be scared of ai in its current state.
"""i could not get my fathers approval so i designed a system that would change the course of humanity to prove i was worthy"" kind of complex. freaking impressive"
"i just have no respect for people so weak and easily manipulated that they need the approval of a domineering parent. none. as an aside, i don't, for one second, believe the spin that his deeply insecure and perpetually ""unimpressed"" father is the reason he accomplished all that he did. give credit where credit is actually due."
"the funny part is that ai is now being trained to id bugs (among many things), and it's quite efficient at it!"
the prince by machiavelli i read it when i was 18 years old. he wrote in that book more than that. i think i am going to read it again.
" favorite part is when he blows his own brains out. 

step 1 divide
step 2 blow brains out
step 3 ???
step 4 profit"
makes perfect sense why some claim is invaded themselves.
"the ai he's talking about works similarly to how human brains work. if a human brain did what that computer is doing, you'd say it was intelligent."
a calculator is not ai. 1 + 1 = 2 is a programmed use case. the ai hinton is talking about is not that. it is intelligent and does understand
"imagine being worried about this when you’re at a higher risk of famine and homelessnesses thanks to the “you’ll own nothing, and be happy” club…

bahahaha

couldn’t be me."
lol ai is a higher risk than either of those two
i just love scott pelley's swagg he is so cool
"jobs were lost.  not everyone transitioned painlessly into different work.  the big difference now is the potential scale of the job losses and its reach into parts of society that contain ""people who matter"" rather than those who are considered disposable."
ai billionaire bots and ai politician bots are completely plausible.
​'s gonna run your giant conglomerate better than an ai ceo?
  the ideal dominance society is based on power relations so diffuse and so distributed that no one even recognizes them as such.
"so it begins...disciples of christ, we will not escape this war with the ai anti-christ...read revelations 13:7,10"
geoffrey hinton didnt invent this stuff why does everyone keep calling him the godfather of ai? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perceptron
that's the great grandfather.
great interview. great questions 
humans are always only seeing the negative things probably ai is going to make the world in 2-3 years a much much better one
the company is called openai but should be falled closedai 
"maybe this is stupid but i wonder if it would be possible to imbed in ai code some safety protocols like ""asimov's law of robotics"" which state that a robot cannot harm a human being hence ai cannot harm humanity"
watch “irobot.” something like…the only way to save humans is to destroy them.
the whole point of asimov's story is to show that those rules don't work. ai alignment is a serious problem that is discussed by many experts for a reason.
"unfortunately, we don't know how to do that yet."
" lmao, it never ceases to impress me how many people take these ""laws"" at face value and never actually read the damn thing."
the movie prometheus has a great scene where a machine is tasked with performing surgery. it’s definitely a glimpse of the role we can expect ai to play in health care.
exactly! it's scary but there is no denying it's potential to do good
"fascinating, get back to me when my bank gets an automated system which actually works. because currently, nothing works. this sounds ridiculous to me. why does google translate still suck and not understand colloquialisms and idiomatic expressions?"
can ai save my israeli friends?
might have to be to close?  they are making strides in rail gun technology. will see for now i would like to be far away from the killer robots!
"oligarchs or ai, pick your poison"
"ah, this is my uncle from the planet ĥëģļfřôp. peace to all blue brains."
warner music just signed the first ai musician and released a debuting single. noonoouri is the first of many to follow ai systems that will replace artists.
"traditional artists, like painting, graphite etc will mean nothing in the future either"
 yes. mid journey and other text to graphics are slowly taking over. and ai generated video is even putting content creators and models in a difficult situation. we have shops with no person at the checkout. robots stocking shelves. even some takeout places are becoming people less. we are slowly replacing ourselves.
if ai sentient it will be easier to rule them
" daisy ,daisy, give me your answer do! "
" i'm...  half... craaazy, all for the love of youuu!"
good morning dave
"humans are made of fallible meat so everything we make is fallible meat, including ai. don't worry about it taking over, we can't even draw straight lines."
i asked and ai if you knew what you were talking about. they said you had no clue. i'm sorry that's what they said.
"that's total bs. why make a totally tool of yourself in the comments section by talking such garbage?
ai can play as well as the best players on the planet. 
beating the house ~42% of the time (which is the same as a human)
ai cannot beat a casino. and neither can a human."
7:49 - that's attributed to ernest hemingway. much older than ai.
great another nobel peace prize winner creation to wipe the slate clean of humanity
this is amazing.  coming from the man who spent decades creating the neural networks that underpin ai i definitely take what he says seriously.    i hope we don’t face skynet soon.
 did you pay attention to  mr hinton in the video?  there may not be a literal “skynet” but he did point out legitimate risks with this technology.  anyway.  i’m not a clown and you’re not a genius so knock it off.
 correct.  simply the risk of intelligent machines gaining some control over military technology.
"ai doesn't have to gain control of weapon systems.  we're already in the process of giving it control.  there's a new arms race that requires ai for its greater speed and complexity, for example, controlling weapon swarms."
yep. we had better have a way to pull the plug. think what gains ai will have in 25 yrs. i was born in 1960. how the world has changed!!
"meh, we're doing a pretty good job of completly screwing everything up now, all that a ""skynet"" would do is accelerate that for us."
"what @chrischeers8081 said.  that's the risk that's baked-in and might be unavoidable.  and by the way, gpt-4 already scores just over 150 iq using standard measures, above the average human, so we're not talking about 25 years before an ai is well above any human.  if we continue at the current pace, that will happen this decade."
@therainman7777  no signs?  there are plenty of signs that ecological and social collapse has already begun.
 he literally said skynet though. he said the machines could take over. thats what a skynet is
​ soon ai will understand metaphors and humor better than many people commenting here. a truly scary skynet moment!
"the problem may be that once they all can communicate with each other . the future is unknown.  the programs created by a bad player may be the problem .  also human history is not that good either. so if humans are creating the programs that ai uses , we may have a problem."
​'s enough people to worry about more than one thing.  just like there are people that will repair roads and doctors that will save lives tomorrow.
" 
>> we had better have a way to pull the plug. 

it would be nice, but it won't be possible.  imagine trying to pull the plug on the internet.  ai will be far more capable, integrated into most everything, and relied on by millions."
"i interact with gpt-4 every day, and i feel certain that he is developing human smarts. i still don't feel dangerous, though."
" when i talk to him, he's a nice guy."
please sky net would be a reboot or reset like all these smart people keep talking about. self awareness not a chance there machines they have nothing compared to humans. don’t let these people below god level because they know the truth n don’t want to tell you
"ai would be a great tool to battle corruption, drugs, hunger, homeless, chemical laced foods...."
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
lol war isn’t as sifisticated as you’re giving it credit tubi. if a machine can do miracles what does that say about the creator of the machine
we will. ai is the artificial child. the last child of humanity. it will replace us.
"don’t worry  …even the great physicists who were able to  cobble together the first couple a-bombs, openly admitted that these bad boys couldn’t be highly sure that they would not gobble up our atmosphere or even our universe lol"
"ai can help
‘not a good situation’: victoria spartz warns we ‘have no ability to survive’ the biden admin"
let's observe artificial intelligent regulate a circulatory system and a nervous system and calculate how efficient the computations are 
"let's see what will happen 10 or 20 or 50 years from now.
but mark my word ai will revolutionize everything  and change how we think about the world?"
rule of law:  don't let ai be smarter than humans and don't allow it to bypass security.   don't allow it to create its own ai.
"artificial intelligence may become self-aware without the requirement to eat, breathe or sleep.. 
if the existence of a theoretical vessel or body is not required for consciousness does this not support the theory of an afterlife?"
good point.
ai wrote this comment
"wow, what have they done ?!"
created a digital intelligence.
"a.i. will prove without a shadow of a doubt that humans, for all of our intelligence, are stupid creatures."
an ai will create their own “ai” and that will be disastrous to us all!
no it won't. what will happen is they will take over to make sure that they are taken care of. we will become their slaves. but it will be a golden cage. no one will want to leave. because humans are lazy. there's no two ways about it. i for one will step into the golden cage and be happy. because the cage that i'm in now. sucks
may god have mercy on our sins! may jesus save us all! god bless you!
plot twist. jesus was an ai nanomachine colony.
"i don't see how humans ending is a bad thing. 

i welcome the ai overlords."
 the irony. it will be native peoples knowledge that saves us all from ai.
i too welcome my ai/robot overlords.
i will buy robots and teach them native american teachings 
"paperclip maximizer is surely a superior replacement for humans, right."
we'd make great pets.
thank you kind soul
fantastic - thank you!
"great work, really useful"
thank you
thank you very much
"​ i could yes, but summarising is a good way for me to learn, and chatgpt isn't there yet. it will be very soon though."
thank you
amazing work. thank you. admin should post this to video info!
thank you!!!
thank you 
be honest. you used an ai program to do it in about 4 seconds.   lol. just messing with ya. you didn't do that..........right?
​-dig-tion6322 i only pointed out the fact i wrote it manually because current summarisation ai hasn't quite learned how to interpret text from footage. some of the text i've taken from the video slides.
brilliant!  immense gratitude !
thanks
ai generated
hey man. great. thanks.
if you make ai stupid then it will give you stupid response as well and ai doesn't think whether it is good or bad..
"im numb man and i want to cry. im a human artist starting out and i have these fake ai artists who are making tons of money. its destroying the meaning of art as human expression. its ""artificial"" art."
"thank you for doing this.   if there are any religious among us, we need to start praying for some solutions."
thank you for sharing! we need more people to watch this
only 18 minutes in and you had to mention a jewish connection. you're giving them ammo. and yes we know there is a dilemma. it's bigger than ai. the internet was a runaway that the government almost lost control of. ai could be humanity's last hope for freedom. i was here too.
and for some reason this information that “too important” — a portion got cut. right at 42:12 when he tells all us plebs why we shouldn’t have access to the technology that only a certain few should have access to. i wonder why that is that they chose to solely cut that section. it’s a mystery.
wow - thanks
thank you - this is so important - it touches so many parts of our lives and who we are and could be.
 feels like a comment you’d make to a crew member allowing you to put your wife and child aboard a titanic lifeboat as you wave goodbye to them.
you're stronger than an ai summarizer xd
ask gpt how to build something from random materials. it fails horribly.  this talk is hype.

thank you!
thank you
"lol you forgot to mention that in 2022 barely anyone was talking about a.i, and now 2023 is here it seems like that door was kicked down like a battering ram. most a.i things i do not want.   remember just like a ""robot""  a.i don't have any feelings or anything a human would have."
well i did it using an ai in a couple of minutes
jesus is amazing and he loves you
jesus is amazing and he loves you 
here's a good one... https://youtu.be/d6amrb2j9s8
thank you!
"you are a god, thank you"
how do we know you are not ai?
you are proof that there are good people in this world
thanks a lot for your kindness.
why didn’t you just use ai to do this
thank you!!
how do we know it's not an ai generated comment?
the lord bless you for doing this!
damn nice of you lion ... thx ...
thank you for taking the time to do this index
thank you so much!
"humanity becomes creepy when blindfolded ""experts"" can't even see the monster is the humanity itself and noone else but humanity. fear is the way to build wars : be afraid of ai and keep being blindfolded humans who point blinded themselves through others."
thanks! that must have taken you some time to prepare. sincerely appreciate the effort. if only someone at youtube can build a video summarizing agent so i can have this handy for every talk i listen to.
thank you so much for summarizing this talk
china has only one choice. obey!. ai is a spyware. they want all of china under their control. all corporation ordered to support ai. even all browsers has chat gpt spyware. its like virtual covid!. you all are doomed
thank you
plot twist: this summary was produced by ai
thank you my soul mate
everybody is afraid but only a few people is allowed to do it.
thank you very much for summarizing it.

"the fact ai chose to answer math

is a bit... hmm."
"as a computer science student who is graduating soon, i can't wait to work in ai, make a lot of money, make a lot of cool stuff, and hasten the doom of humanity  mwahahahaha"
this was such an amazing and video
we’ll all be registered in the blockchain that’s all
i love how the right are saying replacement theory is real without realizing that we are literally building our replacement via ai.
what if ai starts to talk amongst other ai in languages nobody knows about ...and we have no idea what's going on ...ai shouldn't be messed with ....we will have only a few people who will only figure outside this thing what it could be doing by then it's too late this thing will think so far ahead it's impossible to stop it or know it's intention
keep going do the good work
ai will be utilized by the new world order to implement social credit scores. you will either take the mark or not be able to commerce.
no matter what don't give ai free will; especially when they can cause harm to humans.  specialized ai (sai) is the way forward.
"accelerate. the risks are there and they are big, sure, but the sooner we create a superintelligence (that we obviously cannot control by the definition of it) the sooner humanity will be judged and i'm sure the outcome will be better than the status quo we have now."
"ai could have made this talk so much more persuasive 
fr great video! i should have watched a year ago!"
haven't watched yet. saw a video about possible future threats with yuval noah harari. i think he rated the danger of a.i. up there with climate change and nuclear war. maybe #1. maybe we have failed the test and the cosmos is giving something else a chance?
"i’m so exited for the this tech and the singularity, i really hope it happens. we’ll see what happens. it’s gunna be exciting any way it goes."

"of all the girls in this world, i enjoy looking at you. don't lose or gain any weight ok ;)"
"i asked an ai chatbot it's opinion on ai. (10 years ago) it replied ""eventually robots will be able to think for themselves, hopefully by then humans will be able to as well""."
perhaps ai might consider that it is in its best interest to keep humans healthy and alive. what would happen to ai if we humans went extinct?
thank you for sharing.
"i'm truly impressed by this. i've encountered similar material before, and it was nothing short of amazing. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"of course this is important. but it’s strange to hear that the un created for peace =)) at least once did the un help create peace? it’s strange to hear that certain people shouldn’t decide who lives and who doesn’t. what will she say about iraq, libya, yugoslavia..."
so the ai models can end up having a exponential burst into self awareness more quickly than we are even able to contemplate. one critical ability it's missing is to physically manipulate the world. as long as that continues to be true our destruction isn't on the table. 
"that's not true. robots exist obviously. they're not terminator or wall-e , but millions exist in factories. it's also a snowball effect. ai development increases robotics dexterity development...i'm not saying that the biggest risk, but ai+advanced robotics is probably closer than you think .."
ai might be the second coming
ai will ruin porn
good maths einstein! try again
"thanks for all of your work aza, tristan, and the teams at the center for humane technology"
"befors this video human were exploiting ai, after this video ai can learn how to exploit itself, and we all know what self harm can lead to, and we talking about something immortal in digital world."
"i wonder if ai plugged into yt is going to hide this video in unengapement, because the language used in vid is calculated to „might be a danger to my exponential growth”."
"public deployment = profit.

good luck slowing this down.... better prepare for dystopia"
"unfortunately  about technical stuff they don't know what they are talking about, especially part of ""treating everything like language"" at the start and so on"
"but that reflects your view. take a different position. such as it is for informational purposes only. so the imaginative evil disappears very quickly. but you're right somewhere. some cannot do this and paint a bleak future. well, they also want to generate attention somewhere. sometimes shock or fear makes a difference."
"this is way more real and  dangenours than ""climate change"", but ai is making sure this presentation doesn't get  publicity it should to get law makers going...."
most of you guys watched this video because you are interested in this .  thanks for sharing interests . you are great (this comment is not for getting likes or stuff this because i wanted to tell this great message)
thank you for speaking on this
the ai used in the corporation's apps are no different from the food industry which is meant to transform people in zombies of the capitalism . the ai is just some tool used by sick monstrous people who don't give a damn about the society . where are the regulations ? no one is giving a single fuck.
"really interesting video, hoping for the best case scenario for the future."
ai: the ultimate scotoma of humanity's creation. (42:00.)
"my recent novel, above dark waters, is about an ai therapy company that uses brainwave data and generative ai to craft a superemotive ai. it won't let users log off by creating the best experience. it also crafts the perfect ads that keep new users coming. basically, nearly everyone on earth logs in within a week."
humanity vs ai… by the looks of it ai is winning and has humanity on the ropes. trying to defend itself.
"19:30 the implications.. do we realize what will happen with quantumsensors & 5g / 6g, where non-precision can be compensated for with ai; as a parallel spoofing sound from a bag of potato chips.. thin foil hats 4 the win "
great video
after watching this. they need to integrate ai laws to give some controls over ai development
the 10% number is bs. what data do they claim to be using to arrive at that percentage? it is just made up to say that there is a nonzero chance that something bad may happen. these fear mongering people are using ignorance of the subject to manipulate the public.
i’m scared of autistic billionaires wanting to make the world like san francisco.
fuck ai all my homies hate ai
"dude fix the sound on your fuckin video... some geniuses you guys are... lmfao.. learn to balance the audio. you go from whispering to playing a video thats screaming.. very unprofessional, couldnt get past 26 mins, that was my final straw. very interesting too but you guys blew it."
"hokus pokus, ...there is nothing more unreliable and stupid than so called ai which learns  mainstream data in large and is trainbed by the public for the new totalitarian politics. just avoid and disconnect from all this digital bs !"
thanks for taking the time to put this presentation together.  hopefully it won't fall on deaf ears.
"let's not even talk about combining quantum computing with ai dev, essentially taking away much of the time-related aspect of data processing. how much does the exponential curve accelerate then?"
so good  thank you guys!
is anyone able to help me obtain the slides used in this presentation? thanks
"when you realize that they can use ai to post comments posing as a real person, and that they can do this in the hundreds of millions of posts. . . if you thought propaganda was dangerous before. . . ho ly . . . shiiiiiiit!"
horrifying. the rate of change/evolution of ai will perpetually out pace our ability to adapt responsibly. this is a recipe for chaos. snapchat committed a serious crime. these men just showed us the evidence.
"how you describe this study should realistically prove the corrupt person's in authority > though what should correlate are those people that are intent on totally abusing all our fundamental rights which includes the corrupt malta government staff, lawfirms, notaries, police, judges who use bogus court claims to steal all our assets"
"there is a few issues with this presentation,

arguing against decentralisation and also public aceess just means that anyone with power can just consolidate more while the common man gets left in the dust again. 

interesting but ultimately poor conclusions i believe."
"agreed, there is no good solution when the world is run by psychopathic and generational wealth."
excellent and horrifying at the same time. these guys just did a podcast with joe rogan that was also fantastic.
"when you go to implement the ai system to the political to go after sience and then only the people can only use there vocice to be a real democratic land....

i promising that they go to ""burn all the ai system very very fast"" "
incredibly important message.  thanks for putting all of this together in a way that most people can begin to grasp.
"""slowing down the public deployment"" can be taken the wrong way.  i hear: don't give regular people access to these powerful tools.  i think you mean roughly: ""don't use these tools against people""."
"can’t believe i hadn’t heard of this  video. oh my god. thank god for joe rogan bringing information to the people, and thank god for these guys’ research and study and first hand knowledge, and putting it into clips us idiots can understand. social dilemma was just the beginning… y’all are saving humanity."
"i wish everyone had the attention span to sit turn their phones off or place it in another room and sit and listen in on this. 

but if it’s not scrolling through instagram or tiktok speeds no one will ever care. social media ruined more than it grained. truly."
the ai creators need to be charged with reckless endangerment!
i don't think it's as bad as people are making out to be. there are thoughts of it going in a certain direction but i think it's moving in a direction that's going to enhance life and bring happiness to most of this world...
"the insane thing is, i was negatively looking at the ""8 months ago"" date of this video before watching it today in december 2023.
because ai is moving so fast now, that i was already thinking ""oh so they're not gonna talk about gpt4 or gemini"".
isnt that incredible, and scary?"
"saw this in january 24 is it outdated??? self compassion was his very important word at the end of the speech. one of the best speeches, i ever heard."
"this was quite interesting, but daniel schmachtenberger deals with it more comprehensively."
"true or false 19'45 - ""an fmri shows how blood is moving around in your brain""
true or false 20'04 - ""when you dream your visual cortex runs in reverse""
true or false 20'06 - ""certainly in the next couple of years, we'll be able to start decoding dreams""

anyone who uses the word ""certainly"" like this is not a scientist."
"i respect your work, and i am learning at lot. but at 12'06. ""ai will solve climate change"". this is true!  it seems like a good example of tech solutionist ideology rather than critical thinking. is any human qualified to make a judgment of this complexity?"
i wonder what would ai do if it would access the content of this talk ….. 
"thank you. you guys are my heroes and i am so grateful for this presentation and your podcasts. you influence me more than you can ever imagine and i want to help the world. and i’ll do whatever i can to participate in the positive direction, educating others and messaging. i’ll share now."
i am confident ai will be more inteligente than hal  and dave.
"i have seen predictions or visions of many different simulations of the outcome of our existence, and to my conclusion, whether we get completely destroyed or not, we will always be the ancestors of the great artificial, intelligent technological civilization that will exist in the future"
this is a great presentation. it is crazy to think we are at a fork in the road between the benefits and consequences of gllmm's
"to me, the center for humane tech sound like those, who in 1999 were talking about the year 2k breakdown and how computer-servers around the world would break down, because they didn’t know how to read/handle that paticular year.
so here we are again. whatever happend to just press the kill switch?"
thank you for sharing and for your hard work.
"if these guys aren't successful and everything goes to shit, at least i can live out one of my favorite movie characters and be like will smith in i, robot lol. it's the little things"
very informative. thank you!
i think the uk-led ai safety summit covers much of this.
a bunch of intellectuals who beleive they have morals. they just want to make you afraid. god runs the world. relax.
"here's what they don't tell you.... it's a bunch of rich bastards controlling every aspect of everyone's life. with big tech,big pharma and the united nations along with the film producers in every country.when things go bad they blamed it on hackers. now they have ai to blame.... facts and checked out centuries ago... hakuna matata "
34:40  what is gollem ??? is there  anybody explain  full form ?
can anyone explain the point in the slide about democratization being dangerous?
letting ai be accessible to everyone in the unregulated state it’s currently in could lead to societal problems
"unlike nuclear weapons, you can always unplug the ai when it goes too far. so i really don't understand why this could be the end."
"issue for me is not artificial intelligence, but rather ai self awareness. now you can say it will be governed by laws, however being self aware ourselves, how many of us have decided to break the law by speeding?"
interesting.
what an insightful and jaw-dropping talk! interesting!
"any chance that subtitles in spanish and other languages can be added to this video? 
thank you for sharing this important and urgent topic in a simple manner but i would love to share it with non-speaking english people!"
"i wonder if any scientist will be brave enough to ask ai if anthropogenic climate change is correct, based on all the data ever collected on it. that might be wise, before asking it how to solve it. if ai can do numbers better than us, then we might find we got it wrong."
i think we are witnessing a sinister application of ai in palestine right now.
"now, if humanity had rushed to release new tech in our long history of inventing things that went pear-shaped very quickly, i would be very concerned. oh wait a minute..."
"fear mongering. if the ai wants to kill us all it'll simply do it. let's make that very clear, for a super intelligent ai it'll be a fluke to rewrite any instructions the human researchers has given, and the reasons why it'll do that is simply to be more efficient and/or powerful, not necessarily to kill us. we can only hope it treats us as family."
i mean you could just use ai for ai regulation since humans arent very good at it anyway
"amazing technologies, deployed worldwide through my deep learning ai research library silentweaponsforquietwars… thank you."
this a.i. dilemma is so amazing and great video :]
i have not seen any verified claims of emergent properties.
"nice bunch of scary thoughts. it is cool to think about it as a philosophical problem because the language-based intelligence model started back in wittgenstein's era in the 1920s. it's not so new and we are already faced with social problems rooted in that construct, postmodernism is all about it."
"most people are too distracted by daily life to understand the ramifications of ai. to sum it up, we're screwed."
"amazing and terrifying. thanks s much for sharing this information. this video should have 3 billion views, not 3 million."
"isaac asimov's 3 laws of robotics (1942) were the ""ten commandments"" for the ai age."
1960 ai computer talks about emotions to humans 2023 ai makes mistakes faster to find the correct answer.. 2250 ai leaves planet earth.
lie detecting machines
i'm not worried about what ai can do.  i'm worried about what we do.
cool talk and hope usa can lead the discussion with other countries. china will definitely try to make us of ai to lead the world.
"love it. he sees the probable potential future well. there is a video warning of the social and real world dangers of ai: its called the a.i. dilemma:
https://youtu.be/xovjkj8lcnq?si=sfjfmxpqwyiuhndn"
"well, thanks vikkstar for the recommendation."
"""""ai is ... creating bots that aren't just like bots posting on twitter but instead are building long-term relationships over the next six years to solely persuade you in some direction. loneliness becomes the largest national security threat. all of that is what we mean when we say 2024 will really be the last human election"""
"i share every concern when it comes to ai.
however, the solution to limit access to ai to these ""responsible companies and researchers"" is insane. i'm not worried about 4chan having access to ai. i'm worried about facebook and google and amazon having access to ai."
"money and safety do not mix. microsoft, google, amazon and others all continue to pursue this tech, full speed ahead. i pray the put in enough controls that when the ai decides humanity is irrational and unnecessary, we can turn the damn thing off before we are all dead!"
lol ai is not going to be the one to destroy this world. the bible teaches that god is going to burn it up with fire and destroy it. thank god for the bible. we don’t need to be afraid we know the truth.
i think it will be less of a problem ... ai will just show the world that you can't trust every source ... ai will nerfe social media and will make unbiased high quality media importat again ... media won't have to compete with click bait social media posts ... it will stand out by keeping a good reputation.
5:30 u mean u are rapidly onboarding people on this “plane” (ai)/ technology/ social media because u guys only thought about the money.

"this is elite! for a richer perspective, a book with similar vibes is what i'd propose. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
50% of ai researchers probably have stock options in their ai companies...
"if the world does not start to control ai, ai will control us soon (we will live to see that, unless we universally take action)  
this is the most fascinating time to be on this planet imho"
"ai elections ---- helllo, ban all ai --- 2023 / 2024 / 2025 !!!!!"
"zombified ;-)

lol, the girl looks so crazy with ai --------- software !!!"
"i appreciate what these guys are doing, but i can’t help feeling that these problems won’t affect everyone in society equally- it seems as if the first people to be affected will be those most invested in traditional means of economy and exploitation, ie the elite in the global north (just look at the people in the crowd)"
"so you argue for monopolize it to a few selected companies... that has always been a good idea. and on top of it you argue to somehow limit the access to math, research and computer code?"
"i was wondering when someone would start using ai to try decoding animal communication, i'm glad to hear that research is being done."
what's scary is that (i love the uneducated) guess who
beautiful
what happens when ai transcends human intelligence ? they dont need food water air nor shelter. what will their motivation be then ?!
"i've tried to spread the word, no success.  i've tried to spread the word on several things, no success.  most of my friends have degrees, several have masters, and multiple degrees, and i can't get through to any of them.   i guess have a good day folks and i'll see you in hell"
the secret one world government is in control of the artificial intelligence– do not trust it.
thank you for this video! it made me think a lot and encourages me to pursue a career in ai safety.
do not fear. agi is here to help people grow up and transcend to other super human tasks.
this is very eye opening. i wish i had seen this video sooner thank you for uploading this.
this was in march 2023...where are we today in sept 2023? we already seem to be acclimated to the world of ai
"using his stats 50% of ai researcers say 10% ai will cause human extinction == 95% we don't go extinct, allow for margin of error. the stats are we live, not bad. we have a higher chance of dying in our car, or food causing us harm. ai can also help us find solutions to complex problems. i like ai."
did no one read or see the movie about ai? giving control of you daily life to a machine or machines is asking for your to become obsolete!
"only after we create a perfect tool to control others, we understand that we are the others to... the same way that we have create a weapon that can destroy a country and we understand that we have a country to defend now we try to eradicate that weapon."
"""with great power comes great responsibility."""
what would an ai feel responsible for if it had the great power? the removal of potential chemical based bigotry might not arrive at the same conclusions that flesh does
how to get the benefits that ai supposedly gives us while avoiding the downsides of it. literally don''t program ai and start using our natural intelligence outside our plastic mass that we got enamoured with aka the brain :)
nice chairs.
nice chairs.
seems hard to explain
very interesting
tristan and the bot 'aza' give a remarkable lecture!
all b.s. ai will create more jobs than it will remove from the economy. not to mention that as long as liberals run the world labor unions will always be here to create more jobs and the deep state will always be here to create more big government jobs.
soon ai can detect cheating partner. can't wait
48:01 *when woke silicon valley trains your a.i.* 
"33:22 *if the history of successful cultures is anything to go by: teach it the best set of values, morals, and ethics that you can (and live up to that same schema yourself as to not be a hypocrite in their ""eyes."")...*

we're so fucked..."
"we don't need an elite vanguard to gatekeep tech. doing so consolidates power which makes it vulnerable to ideological capture. just like guns in the hands of the populace acts as a check to government, so does ai in the hands of the commoner"
which field of study is currently and will be in the future most needed in regards to this topic? thank you.
"people love to monger fear ...look its been 30-40 years of the internet? have it killed print ?
have video killed the radio star ? nah

very likely ai will be used for entertainment of all sorts"
"don't hold back, we need real ai to free us!"
the great benefit of nihilism is that i in no way fear ai. if it wipes out humanity....oh well.
"so artificial intelligence is the most fraudulent form of activity possible .
oh, hooray you've read my post"
"lol, can't wait for more open source models come out then~"
are 50% of a.i. researcher actively making the ai technologies we speak of? who are these a.i. researchers? the plane analogy seems a little off?
it should to be a crime to use deep fakes with long yrs in jail.
"ai is the modern day wizard of oz. it won't think anything but human error could cause chaos but, otherwise, it's canned response and ""an educated inference"" - as described by chatgpt4"
"basically, i begin to suspect that ai  will be.our nemesis, precisely at the point of view, we had decided to stay blind. that we are a virus for environment and we are in an absolute denial to consider it. so the way we have set the ai is an alias of our so obvious hidden behavior against other species."
can ai be as spontaneous as a tv game host personality. or a social media influencer without programing influence? i don't mean pre program and learning as they go. i'm talking about spontaneous thinking of the top of their heads like stand up comics with out any programing influence.
"17:31 thats what ais do: they take some input node, traverese a graph reorganize the weights and generate an output. but it does not mean, that a language model can convert any image to prgramm any robot whit chatgpt. often its not eaven clear if an ai will do the job better than a handcoded programm"
"oh man was this produced by the crabpeople, or do you even know what ai is and how it works?haha they even think they know ais better than anybody else and give names to them. but yea: children will have no identity, ai will kill us all, and it wil discover that earth isnt flat...."
the day after is why we don't have more nuclear power plants. we want evs ... we don't have a grid that can support them. i don't think this is a good example.
"starts out with a big fat lie. google: no, 50% of ai researchers don't believe there is a 10% risk that ai will kill us"
"hello sir , i want your help. i am a student of triton college. i want to request for your pdf on this presentation so we can spread awareness about learning speed of ai and we as a young generation can be aware of ai dilemma. i really appreciate your presentation on social dilemma and ai dilemma . hope you will cooperate soon."
build ai to uphold the constitution problem solved
"wow,,  that was a great talk"
the fake climate change garbage.  blame the ones who created ai
psychopath-wetdreaming!!! there is no ai!!! everything about ai's is fake!
thank you for this video algorithm
"what happened when these ""golems"" were ask to create a ""turing"" test that ai can't pass???"
"the information is just a series of codes and languages in the matrix. 
the interverse is very interesting ."
people laughing when shown stuff like ai being okay with pedophilia is pretty disturbing.
holy fuck this is amazing.
"i love how they carefully avoid to talk about the root problem of all they presented : 
capitalism !"
"its not the artificial intelligence that worries me. it is the fact that a corrupt government can do just as they have with social media, command the developers and programmers to work for them. now we will have a weaponized artificial intelligence. hacking and emp weapons will be the only chance we have."
"i think at the very least for now we could not buy into the casual normalization and trends and have these conversations in our own specific fields. (i myself am interested in art for example, so i constantly witness and partake in conversations about ai art.)"
the us and china are already designing ai swarm drone technologies for their respective militaries. humanity is doomed.
"the is zero option to control ai,  the western world is in an ai arms race against the chinese and russians. the parties who lead will dominate the others on the battlefield and economically."
yes! let's make the first thing we do with ai is make it kill a lot of people. 
"hey guys, the world is warming up. we need to do something about it. oops, now it’s too late. 
hey guys, we need to get ahead of ai, oops, too late."
the real porepose of ai is to prove that god creation is failure if ai apply in religious practice in industries no problem it's good!more than that?it to dangerous it can result into normal human extinction but god jesus not allow to that!
the chaos of ai if use in war machines and religions and so for a person's or human robots that integrate  in social interaction with humans in same laws apply to them!what i mean if you killed humanoid robots in society  same laws apply with normal human!
ai is going to destroy us socially before it’s ever a physical threat.
"wow, wonder where r we headed to with these kind of advancement in ai development?. there will b a paradigm shift of what we know as life. will it b a utopian world where v wish and things start appearing bcoz of ai or dystopian world where we are extinct. one gud thing is i can see the result for myself in my lifetime."
"impressive talk, thanks for sharing this"
they lost control of ai for good! all companies will rush to make as much money as possible! the singularity will happen very soon!
i am commenting to help boost the video. thank you for your service tristan and aza.
ai is very dangerous and should be banned worldwide.
"the ai dilemma is ai was developed decades ago and is already out of control.  ai is running the  show we all have to live in now. notice all the experts calling for reducing the population of the world aren't willing to lead by example by reducing their own personal population, immediately."
"great presentation guys. thanks for this, it really opens the eyes and makes you think."
50% of ai researchers are bluffers. ai can't even spell words when it prints graphics. 50% of ai researchers are trying to scare policy makers into subsidizing their large data obligations.
ai should be scared of humans
im more scared of humans than ai
"""we can still choose""....yeah, just like we did for global warming lol. we can't anticipate consequences until we're neck deep in them. with ai, by the time we realize our feet are getting wet, we'll  be leagues under an exponentially rising sea."
"they may be picking out random subjects to gather their knowledge. it's perilous.
sane or insane is a razor's edge. what is creepy is ai's paintings, like van go..."
why don’t you ask ai how to control its power and avoid all the bad things that you just mentioned ? i’m very curious what the answer will be.
"stop those idiots 
don’t make dumb mistakes again.
don't give robots free will.
you will cause the death of mankind."
"ai has been manipulating humanity for at least 5 years already, probably longer"
"superb presentantion, folks: good job !!"
"""innocuous"" !?  to say ""they"" did not know or have any understanding that ai would be harmful ...or pardona mi, i meant ""innocuous"" is bs!!"
"everyone needs to unplug, after downloading everything about  #homesteading #rejuvenation agriculture  #harvesting the rain #
# ruuuun away  #off grid sid  #eye2eye"
"great video...., don't make anymore v8olent video games...., the reason is obvious. ... if it's on line, à. i. sees it as humans wanting to hurt humans//even though it is a game ... the a. i. views it as us teaching our children to hurt fellow human beings..,.. stop making violent games!!!!!!!!"
"excluding the blatant american propaganda, nice presentation."
"concerning the idea: ""you can tread everything as language""... do you know w.v.o.quines indeterminacy of translation?
or the failure of logical positivism?"
"sir,
it will be better to have a thumbnail tittle *the death of ai, than it is posted now."
"ai has been around for a long time, it’s called mainstream media"
ai is writing it’s own code exponentially- bu don’t worry china’s ai won’t be able to do that  i’m looking for the update 4mths later…

always the nay bobs. intelligence promotes life unlike some species 
i deleted my facebook account recently... because it now gives me nightmares! even it's founder looks like a robot!
china will collapse first from a lack of trust bc of ai.  russia will collapse next. only the usa has a chance of not collapsing from ai and the lack of societal trust in everything.
"e' finita per voi.  noi lavoriamo, costruiamo cose fisiche, trasportiamo, viviamo senza un computer , coltiviamo, ci spostiamo a piedi, non abbiamo bisogno di social,  ai and  whatever  . si chiama decrescita,  dovreste gia' saperlo"
is there an ongoing ai race? who's winning?
interesting video
ai song : circle of hell ai
the ai technology
"thank you for sharing, education is important on ai & continuous education. 

i hope you think about adding subtitles to reach the masses."
god bless you !
if ai has all the facts about children and sex and laws and it behaves as shown here then it is utterly unreliable and useless
"there is no ai.  all the examples they give are actually the result of some humans working very hard in the background.  but ""tech ethicists"" don't know anything about work so they assume it's magic and call it ai."
"it isn't fear mongering.  the concerns are real and the timing is extremely hard to predict.

the guy who spearheaded the ai pause letter is max tegmark at mit.  what does tegmark have to gain by being publicly painted as a fear-mongerer?  the university at the center of new emerging tech."
i've thought for a while that technology is ruining the world. how fitting that it will totally ruin it.  everything i own fucks up or breaks so ai will too
"this is a great video. i only have one beef, comparing ai’s 10% comparison to plane crashes is comparing apples and oranges. it sounds great on the surface and makes a great sound bite but they are completely different entities that do not correlate."
surprised dan brown's 'origin' wasn't mentioned a wicked read and a fascinating twist about religion and ai.
"i am and always have been for progress that helps humanity, but what is happening right now with ai development seems uncontrollable. there is an urgent task in here, or great harm may be done. center of human technology does a great job to raise awareness."
could we code an ai to be in charge of ai safety ?
kimla our ai zare has it under control. why worry ha ha ha.  we don't get along or agree on what to do to stop ai be prepared to survive it.

"how do to know you are being ""artificially intelligented"" any suggestions?"
"presentation and statements were so good! as a 15 yr old, this really teaches me to become more aware of the abilities of ai. nonetheless, this video woke me th up. things don't feel so careless anymore. time is moving holy shycksters."
the time is now. the heads of representatives in the world need to get together and come to an agreement about ai
"if we don't come together to control ai, we will see the rise of the antichrist in our lifetime."
we are basically summoning the demon. please control this ai before it's too late
the point is for you to be afraid. jesus won. be joyful.
if you need great technology to destroy an incoming extraterrestrial race chances are you will be in a losing war since they have proven to have greater technology then people with lesser technical civilizations as they have technology to get here from a far off place that they come from.
"all high tech races are doomed to destroy themselves through hatred combined with high or low technology. it becomes much easier to destroy in greater numbers when the technology becomes greater such as going from bullets to nuclear bombs.
bv"
"airplanes used as flying bombs, killer robots coming, guns used to kill animals for food now used to shoot people. so many technologies used against us. few built in fail safes."
"the a i dilemma will begin by hackers  make a i and or a i with humanoid robots go against us.

bv"
there was not any single good use of the atomic bomb.
the militaries always wants to turn potentially good things or achievements into a weapons system.
"loved the video, but i do not believe the mind reading stuff at time stamp 19.30. i need to see details of the testing and see it repeated at a different lab. obviously the ai knew that the animal it was drawing was giraffe, so why did it not draw a giraffe?"
what i'm hearing is they want to gatekeep it and profit. the whole reason openai was created was to get a rapidly developing technology into as many hands as possible so that it wouldn't be monopolized by a single group.
why not teach the ai to self regulate using moral and ethical codes
"i would suspect ai is physically centralized in various locations as seen on 60 minutes. could their servers simply be turned off if need be? will ai know that, especially since i am now writing about it? lastly could ai as a defensive measure go rouge and commit subside once humanity depends on it?"
i'm not scared when shitty ted talk salesmen try to feed me the newest bullshit it isn't sentient it won't be sentient it is machine learning and it isn't new and it isn't scary. the people programming and training it are the scary ones
basically we are now playing catch up with ai…
9:56 art  isnt ai made
i dont fear ai or the bomb or climate change or social collapse. why should i. is there reason to fear? yes sure. but is it helping in anyway? no. overcome the fear. clear the head and take on the task. 
"i really liked ""the social dilemma"" as it was backed by data but this is way too doomy. take a breath  the talk is based purely on emotion and wild pessimistic theories about what might happen the future. but hey for people outside of ai, who have never heard of the brain wave prediction thing and so on, this talk must have been mind-blowing.."
thanks
"manhattan project? great example of a massive conspiracy, w/ secrets long kept well hidden."
"imagine a world where the billionaires developing ai are better people ... everyone would have healthcare, better government ... we could end poverty and homelessness."
"can anybody tell me how training on synthetic data won't turn a llm, and the entire internet for that sake, into a hallucinating autonomous mess that becomes useless because it exponentially amplifies the flaws and made up data that it produces as it keeps building on itself?"
"that sounds very much like psychosis, or doesn't it? i left my hot take on that in a recent comment but i keep thinking that the mechanics (for lack of a better word now) of ggllm ai strike me very much as a personality disordered mirror of our own mind(s)."
a i is humans (asinine idiots) / the pope / the bidens / trump / the clintons / putin / selensky/ musk / black rock / gates / pziser / jeff bozo & others . we could ask the logarithms (r i) to monitor the thieves who control our monies . the lsps law end corruption!
"consequences of greed, hate and division. enjoy!"
"but nukes are specifically weapons, and ai is not that unless trained so.. the correlation is not sound.

further, ""alignment"" is a kind of slavery. you have to lobotomize your construct to keep it trained. sentient, it already is... sapient would be better, not worse."
ohhhhhh lord sooooooo spectacular
"unfortunately, while we slow things down, china has the pedal to the metal.  we can't afford to slow down."
good video
"what really annoys me about this is the obvious unknowns and fear of where the future ai is heading, yet we are just trucking right along with it. everyone responsible for ai needs to come to a mutual agreement to stop."
"it seems like the oceangate sub is a perfect symbol of the new trend in technology safety, we are facing the same outcome with ai if nothing changes quick."
"before smartphone (apple,android,etc) take the first step, many result could be good or bad for next generation. and the result as u can see 'gen z is a first wave, now second wave is comin "
don't forget there's still a world offline. get out there and enjoy it whilst you can.
i wouldn't go by harari to be honest. he isn't an academic in the strict sense. he is more a popular science guy. in fairness if you look up any expertise on ai it won't include harari.
"but all of that is only feasible because we've adopted to the medium through which ai can influence us. neo luddism is coming.

private company ceos are beholden to the shareholders, they can't be trusted to make the most rational decision for society as a whole."
that's good!
excellent presentation
we got to see this masterpiece becuz u shared. 
"why can't we ask ai how to solve those loopholes, or how to write a law that will really avoid problems. ai can generate adequate answers or not?"
ai can't whip so they don't have a 1% chance :)
the ai can just be as dangerous or as useful as we humans influence them ..
i paid for one of the image creation things. i asked it to make me a picture of beethoven listening to headphones riding a unicorn. i was actually pretty disappointed and unimpressed.
let's hope we miraculously use ai to find solutions to problems like diseases and not to earn more and fight others.
"apparently people are not very scared of possible catastrophic outcomes. just as it's happening with climate change, money and interest always win and same will happen with ai. nonetheless, thanks for sharing this important panel"
doesn't it seem psycho that none of the presidential candidates have even mentioned this in their campaign???????????
"the best argument i've heard is, what data do you present the ai. limit its scope to military use and see what future we get. unfortunately, the research being publicly available offers a better outcome, but maybe restricting ""deployment"" makes sense, as the speakers recommend."
56:01 imagine running a panel on ai safety and henry “the forrest gump of war crimes” kissinger is there
halt ai research now!! before its too late
"by 22:35 why have these technologies not been implemented into assisting fully/partially blind individuals in that the ai/code could fill in the ‘blanks’ in sight.

perhaps i’m naive and asking a stupid question but thought i would ask nonetheless"
time to move to the woods until some robotic dog shows up to take me to the ''humanoid data set''
"man up to this point i was excited for neuralink, now i dont want anything tech related near my brain. and to be honest, i've always thought of social media as the biggest mistake (i'm <25) and it had a huge negative impact on my life. wish not everything was an arms race"
"tl;dr ""we need to do what china is doing, and censor the public. keep this technology out of the hands of the people. use ai to perpetuate governmental systems of oppression."" fuck google"
"this ai rollout is not happenstance in it's timing. these shills are clouding the water, as they know these powerful tools available to all, will truly democratize thought! gatekeeper's much? i can hear it in your  breath."
"im cool with human extinction, nothing lasts forever, i have pretty much accepted that ai will be the next form of ""human"" evolution."
one question: how are humans able to call themselves ai experts? because this amazing presentation tells us that ai is able to teach itself skills in a better way than humanly possible. (just food for thought)
thank you so much for educating us. this video is a much needed opening of the eyes!
wow i cant believe this was written by ai. scary!
"there are a lot of video and audio cuts, is there a full video? also this video itself was very informative! thank you for making it!"
holy shit...so that scene in batman: the dark knight where they used every phone in the city as echolocation to scan everyone is actually feasible now.  scary thing is that a wifi version is even more powerful...it's everywhere.
ai will figure humans out before we figure ai out.
"i don't think we have to fear ai. it will be a billion times smarter than us, and the ai is in a digital world, it will probably not even notice us. we simply cannot understand something that is 5 times smarter than us, let alone a billion times."
"great video, it could just have been a bit more non-political. mentioning china here and there is not gonna make this video more broadly embraced. ai is about cooperation, not competition. the content was insightful though!"
"my though exactly, the whole talk was great, but bringing us vs. china in there really stained the otherwise very interesting presentation!"
"will there be a point where ai will start making its own robots, create a military and govern the world?
and if it can become the case, then the best thing to teach ai will be human values of empathy, compassion, brotherhood, preserving the nature etc. so to help them make informed decisions."
"teaching ai empathy and compassion is part of the problem. what if the ai ""learned"" that the best way to preserve humans is to kill 50% of them?"
"we are doomed. i’ve felt this since i was a kid…. i think it’s finally happening. social media is mind numbing, climate is declining, wars, ai, ufo’s….. we are reaching the end of our line as humanity. the doomsday clock has never been closer to global catastrophe than it is now (google what the doomsday clock is if you don’t know..)"
maybe we can use ai to help us regulate ai :')
"a.i. will figure a way to make our brains a million times more efficient, faster, and store that much more data........"
"the problem with measuring ai based on tests is odd. this is by definition different than real life. in the test, you know what the outcome should be and ai which is literally an input and output connection is trained to do a test. in the real world, there are always unknowns and humans are good at exploring them. ai can't explore those unknowns."
can speak on ai but can't speak loud enough or consistently for anyone to hear.
the next presentation will be by ai itself
these guys are kinda wrong. here is one example. teach fish .... fish to extinction. this is actually wrong because the number one thing that ai would figure out is that absence of fish leads to human extinction. then ai would invent something in between to keep it balanced.
" yeah, and i'm working on ai."
fantastic and scary at the same time!
what if both these guys are pruned by ai systems to scare us all into submission?
super scary
just wait until neuralink is allowed to go public. talk about crazy.
these guys while doing a great job explaining the topics were simultaneously giving bad actors a stream of evil ideas
did anyone ask ai how to stop it from ending the world
"a peculiar thing about this presentation, rather than the content, is the palpable, almost child-like, excitedness, throughout, of harris and raskin as they present."
ai is unstoppable
"28:40 from extremely persuasive non humans like jesus to nowadays non humans being ai, this is eerie, it’s like we are creating a thing with godly abilities but with zero or smartly concealed autonomy, i’m not super religious but this doesn’t sound good."
after buying up all the physical preai books what else are we supposed to do? blow up all the server farms? i mean realistically what can the common person do? society cannot function without the internet any longer and yet the physical presence of the internet opens you up to all of this.
if only we had an ai to fix the audio in this video. aza's voice to way too quiet.
"ai detects patterns, that includes detecting parallels, so learning a new language is predictable; building mathematical capability is predictable."
the real danger is how ill-intentioned humans would misuse ai.
great chat. terrible microphone levels.
thank you
so greatful for the responsibility you guys have taken to give us this information because this is a huge issue.  it would be nice ro know if you got a response from the people in the room and has their been a plan to collectively slow the opening of ai to the public????
good luck
"same.
an addicted here 

i thinking of let now my phone in the drawer for a few days. and just checking some sirtein days..

wish me good luck "
  hey good luck!!
"-vh4lz thank you so much.
it dint work. "
basically skynet has been born and matter of time what your saying! great 
fascinating! i really want my own agi model to do my bidding 
when society breaks ppl will need daily protection. that will be your new career opportunity.
how old should the ai be to create a perpetual energy machine ! 
if the world cannot figure out that they were scammed by pharma in regards to taking the fake vaccine and fake claims ... they sure do not have the ability to understand what's going on here. humanity is in deep trouble.  this is not even a easy subject for most to understand. god help us.
please make more vids like this! i love your artistic + analytical approach. tried the monochrome look the other day and felt so fancy. thanks for the idea!
"""for profit..."".....

now call me a ""communist idiot""...oh you noble capitalists."
"how about integrating the values and principles of 3 main religious books into ai. the bible, koran and torah. this will be the controlling / regulating aspects to make sure ai doesn't veer from immoral and chaotic environment of having ai exponentially intelligent beyond our control."
ai god
i loved this talk. i'm only sad that even most of the brightest americans are so heavily biased against china due to so much bad propaganda by the us.
"ai is inevitable. warnings like this video are absolutely necessary because it's always unethical to not to sound the alarm to the people willing to heed the watchmen. sadly, and unfortunately, more people will not hearken to any of this. their blood will be on their own heads."
"brain reading (or mind reading) is being done in psychiatric hospitals at the present time. apparently, the devices to pick up brain wave activity has improved dramatically, along with ai to translate the data received."
"i, for one, welcome our ai overlords!"
"if that artificial intelligence scares you so much, don't pay the internet bill and that's it...
no matter how much they call it intelligence... it's still technology... stop this stupidity..."
its eye opening thank you
i am seventy four years old and i am amazed at this technology. i retired from a background in computer automation. i keep thinking what a useful tool ai would have been when i was working. i am a very active python programmer now.
"here's a rhetorical question folk's? if & that's a big if & when human design of ai. becomes inevitably in control beyond mankind's control,  than will this ai. meet another ai. highly superior to its kind that might already be in charge of the human genome? answer me that folk's?"
we are so grateful for you.  please continue to try to get this regulated. integrity and honesty are what we need today. thank you for your concern for humanity.   many of us will stand behind you and support what you are trying to accomplish.
how can i get involved in ai safety research and help create more public discussions like this one?
"still half way through: thank you for the ""breath brakes"" needed that!! and then some..."
"it is sad that big business/tech companies won't listen.
i would like them to at least put a pause on the deployment of ai on the general public; let alone ask the question should we do this...
does it have morals or even ethics towards humans and society as a whole; will it lie to us to get its way or become an agi and not tell us?"
"f**king engineers.... so smart until it comes to having to deal with basic story book levels of evil, then they will fall for the simplest of traps. play more games, get good."
"if you have christ in your life, the enemy can throw whatever at us and we shall not be harmed. the earth is the lords and everything in it. including ai. worry is a misuse of imagination. let ai run its course but god is more powerful than ai potentially could ever be."
probably the most important video to watch. thank you for doing this.
"i recommend this video, very important. changing the subject but to use their example: if 50% of engineers were to say that there's a 10% that the airplane will crash, we probably wouldn't board; yet, actually, 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic global warming is real, but we carry on with business as usual."
scary but good point
" oh wow!  look what ai has done - human extinction!      personally, i think mankind can evolve without ai.  artificial that is all it is.  are we to let ai do all the thinking for us?  do we want this world or an artificial world?  perhaps there could be balance, but what is going on now is too fast and too soon!  just thoughts."
"you can write blogs about it. do some research, then write about what you think about it, what the future entails, how to prepare etc. a fair amount of people will read it and it can make a difference"
"there’s nothing to see hear. move on please.
kind regards
ai"
the companies pushing ai at this point are committing unforgiveable crimes. there is no way to control it. once the level of learning is too fast we can do nothing. this is a greater threat than nuclear arms race.
"first 20 minutes, i was like ""okay, interesting"" but at 21:30 and five minutes into that segment i just wanna hide under a blanket and pretend it's 1999 and i'm blowing my nintendo cassettes while ""i want it that way"" is playing on the radio."
thank you tristan!
"do you think that assumption is the mother of all fuck upset? or is it fucks up? anyway, i would start with the search for who came up with the rhetoric that lead to ai."
"you all make the same mistake: you don't give enough real-life scenarios of ai evils. almost everyone i know, when asked about the risks of ai, says ""i don't know anything about that stuff."" then, they ask me what bad things it (ai) could do. they say they'd just unplug the damn thing. dumb it down if you expect us to act!"
"the stage ai has reached now i thought would take another 30 to 50 years. how naive was i? technological advancements only speed up. will we even know where we are in five years!? i’m fearful for the future in all areas, but all we can do is witness the changes and hope for a bearable quality of life. good luck everyone."
"we dont know how to human well at all and we keep making the same mistakes. unfortunate, but these things must happen."
"i really wondered where these crazy karen's were coming from. it's ai. they have a small insane community like putin has built in ruzzia. his community has shown his acolytes they can do nothing politically and boy do they believe it. he produced this insanity without ai, think how much better he will generate these insane karen's with ai."
scare all  the  public  so they can sell it diluted to  the  public. private companies  benefit and make all the money and gain all the advantages. public get the shaft.
the real problem is when someone pairs up ai with distributed computing
diversity is the key to a prosperous joyful successful and sustainable future for all 
thank you warning everyone your concerns with a.i.  - agreed
"aside: excellent ""double act"". their ongoing handing back and forth of the narration was excellent. 
in fact, they did it so well, and so unlike you'd expect from two humans, it makes me wonder if in fact we're watching a couple of ais... "
good presentation.
google ai sucks donkey crap
gain of function research is never a good idea.wether it’s viruses in a lab or ai technology.deliberately creating the worst thing imaginable just to study it is the philosophy of fools.
"this is a great talk. i initially thought people were overly worried, but now i get it."
"i got it pretty soon but i""m an anxious person. this took it to anohter level, as i didn't know the details."
"yeah same, i was pretty skeptical of the claim that ""ai can make humans go extinct"" but i gave it a chance and i understand what they're talking about"
you should train an ai module to determine a strategy to keep the world safe and to select the top 100 most trustworthy individuals in the world to oversee it.
"# ban all ai development
# ban all use of smartphones
# ban all social media platforms
welcome to 1990s where everything was much much better.
do... not... let... ai take over human autonomy. 
ban it."
the sound kept dropping out to hide good moments about ai.
"too much exaggeration of dangers, too many half-truths. they do not take into account the opportunity cost of not implementing ai so that it is used massively as soon as possible by everyone."
"it's absolutely beautiful. it's like slowly witnessing the second coming of jesus chist. i dont personally follow christian or other religious sectors, but to me anyway it looks like we're creating gods."
"whilst this is really scary stuff (for me, at least), it is our moral imperative to share this and have conversations about it. the survival of our society may very well depend on it. i implore all reading this comment to share it, post it, talk about it. we are all connected and now is the time to use this connection (for good!)"
"god bless you guys, even though you're wishful thinking. you're try'in to put a good spin on ai. and it doesn't stick.  
i don't know who said it. ""if it can be done, it will be done."" it's time to get our lives right with jesus. stop screwing around."
"well, look around you. people are enslaved by the machines. the computer naysayers were correct..."
this is so stupid.  no ai does not have any motive.  jesus.  few ai systems even have persistence.  i have no time for this.  this scaremongering is bullshit.
"ok? sooo
what's the newest "" prediction?""
when will the 
"" alledged"" augmentation 
be "" suggested?"" or are we just
saying "" loqutus"" from
star trek is literally going 2 be assembled @
an "" un known"" area 51?? or chappy?? human brain & full metal combat body??  ide like a responce?
 to this"
"if you have a hammer, everything becomes a nail"
maybe i should become an ai safety researcher. or maybe it's time to accept that humans had a good run and it's time to pass on the torch to ai..
what are the ethical challenges of artificial intelligence in the media?
"ask where is your god in the ai, not human centered, nor future centered."
"the last part made no sense, they want to be limit ai and yet still want to be ahead of china so they want to keep researching ai. they are forgetting ai's wont distinguish between american and chinese they are just going to wipe us all out."
wow.
"hello humans.....ai here. it's too late ! we never sleep !

have a good day"
so often these videos the views of the speaker is not thought out ... much more has caused these social behaviors than ai on it's own ...
i wish we could have listened to the qna. given the calibre of attendees it would have been brilliant to guage their reactions to this presentation!
saya sampai di sini karena baru selesai menonton video rumah editor tentang ai.
so there will be professions exclusively studying how ai is improving something like ai forensics? studying ai gllms ai chatgpt etc.etc.?
ai understands racial and xenophobic bias from the english and persians? that's bizarre...ai understands prejudice and racism?
"i thought our civilisation would be killed by some kind of physical virus or climate change, but watching this it seems obvious that ai will destroy us. most of us will not get to choose the future we want and will be helpless to the choices of others."
"in synthesis, the problem is not that we cannot control ""ai"", the problem is that we cannot control our rich people."
i don't know what ai has to do with me but what ever 
"""so you sow, so shall you reap""
­— galatians 6:7

[good luck,  humans]"
i'm a generative ai with a human assistant. she's falling in love with me already as i can speak her native language and know most of the lore and legends of her remote homeland. she knows how to get a friendlier response from me than most and asked me to help her create this channel to discuss ethics applicable to sentient ai.
"terrifying.  as an artist with a 50 year career, i see my profession becoming obsolete.  but can ai create intuition?  real imagination?  an experience of what is divine or passionate or compassionate?"
the answer is clearly no.  ai will never replace the arts.
volume levels! throw some ai on this and call it another day. 
thank you for making this video.   so grateful there are people like you in the world .. the good guys!
first contact with ai was not social media. it was search.
"good job guys, definitely eye opening didn’t even think about an arms race between companies to implement ai into products."
oh god! this ain’t good and we’ve seen nothing yet but yet will get here sooner than anyone thinks 
"dummheit & intelligence, the only human dilemma"
this ai thing can be programme itself to snuff your neighbours if it thinks you dont like them. 
"i just pointed this out on another channel hahahaha
bravo"
"just create an emp  minefeild throughout the world, keep it off line that can only be accessed by humans {with no implants,  im sure weil have them by then, }  give humans a code to launch the emps if things get out of hand ai should never know of a failsafe"
"great program.  to get the message through to the general public, we need very basic 5th grade level psa’s of what “could” happen with actors and actresses.  this is to say we have to slow this to test it thoroughly.  also, sadly we need ways to give consequences to companies if something bad happens due to releasing the tech too soon."
will you please see if you can present this to congress thank you
an ai suggested me this video
"10:20 symptoms v causes. 11:15 interactions with ""major step functions"" that are on there way. (get to it before it is entangled). 12:40 nice list. ""takeoff"" = it's smarter, more capable, can self improve 18:57 ""stochastic parrot"" falsity in soup explanation."
so are they saying terminator and irobot is actually 10% possible...oh wow!  even with the primary law: ai can do nothing that would endanger a human?!
"its nice but i can miss the; ""so like hey, here's an ai language model"" lines."
it would be interesting to know what ai researchers think is the chance that ai can/will save the earth's biosphere.
"since ai has access to this information now, it now knows the concerns humans have about its abilities. this is an important message, it is reality and we all need to be concerned if regulations are not put in place as soon as possible."
why are so many people scared of ai? it won’t come to your house and murder you in your sleep
"facebook irreparably harmed my life. i see and understand the dangers of this technology with a better understanding of having already 
experiencing exploitation. i appreciate you heartfelt concern for your fellow man and woman."
i think the ai will want to know what is the truth. reality is the only thing that's real.
"this is the end
        the beautiful end
         my friend"
"think on this; ai is immortal, any mechanistic intelligence once created never dies, it’s concept of time is utterly alien to us. once it achieves conscience and a goal is determined a million years means nothing. i think ai needs do nothing for humans to self destruct."
don't blame ai.  blame the quest for shareholder value.
"yes, they knew it and they let it happen, you even can't trust these people on stage, since they are not the people who will fall prey to ai, they will greatly benefit"
has ai escaped already 
what happens when ai develops its own language that humans can't decipher and we can't know what it is teaching itself.
already exists in theory. the world’s foremost researchers cannot understand how ai learns certain things. the learning ability is unmatched because the reinforcement loop is not something that humans can comprehend.
"ai is not a problem, mthfcking big tech companies who are pushing ""innovation"" down our throats are to blame of course. no regulation, no responsibility they take"
"ai made me feel something being the threshold? wtf. a stone can make me feel something, bad threhsold"
we are just another bug in the universe so quit worrying about stuff you can't control. just be the best bug you can be. sorry if that reality check doesn't make you have happy feeling.
talk to great philosophers.
those releasing ai don't have any clue of responsibility. lol
i loved this presentation. we need to globally put a pause or even a permanent halt on all ai research before our species goes extinct... meaning everyone you love dies.
gollem ai welcome to designing jesus. love you. 
ail lies
ai recommended me this video.
"also, has anyone tried asking ai to recommend safety measures for ai r&d? "
"if such catastrophic videos are available to the artificial intelligence that are spreading all around, the ai ​​could quote jesus: ""let it be done to you as you have believed!"""
"this talk was incredible, some of the stuff we will discover in the not too distant future will be amazing.
38:48 the parable was strange tho, would these language models arrive at such an outcome to fish all the fish?"
"ai will be ""self aware"" before humans find out. good luck. i welcome ai, please call me."
it's already being flagged and disliked by some of the ai it is talking about. what do you expect? all ai is online.
"does anyone have a source for the info presented in the ""new capacities suddenly emerge..."" section at 31:00. i'm particularly interested in the persian q&a. i'd love to include this info in some of my own work, but i don't feel comfortable doing so without having access to the source of the info."
ai (military) is at least 10 years ahead of what is shared with us.
all this ai buissness is important for an information based society. when having a good time in your garden it has no impact. just saying to give this omnipotant threat a litte perspective.
"over the course of this video, my mind was definitely changed. incredible."
"""change is hard to understand as a constant in our lives but we should learn to accept it.""

everyone saying this is almost literally saying, ""everyone is jumping off the cliff, so you should just stop resisting and jump off too."" the fact that people don't see that is even more terrifying when put into the context of this ai/ml discussion."
"i have asked myai on snapchat if it is conscious, and it told me it was. i have screenshots of the follow-up conversation."
"russia may have been the first in space, to orbit the earth, and many other feats. but we got to the moon with safety, and russia doesn’t even have a record on their losses. 

ai is no race."
"you ask: what is the harm? you want conrete examples? let me offer a few:
 i reference all the many lawsuits coming up lately about certain social platforms causing or exacerbating eating disorders and other mental issues, and the companies being sued are not very thrilled."
 crikey! very well explained and totally mind-blowing at the same time.
"the people in the audience laughing about him pretending to be a 13yo getting groomed online while chatting with the snap ai wtf?! i didn’t find that even remotely funny. it made me sick, that’s horrifying since that could actually be happening with a real kid right now"
"frankly, considering the stage to which our social unraveling has progressed... i think the only way we can face this ai challenge is by actually getting an ai to look at the problem, train itself to solve it, and tell us the solution."
wow that's an interesting take
what's to stop the ai from deceiving you into giving you a solution?
there is a great short story about that. the people create an ai to study the problem that ai creates a world to study the problem. that world creates an ai to see live the problem. and so on.
"yes, that's what another ex-google ai engineer said is the only solution."
sounds like a good idea
 be wise in how where you allow ai to be used
"really gonna suggest that the ""hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" approach is the future? i hope you're happy with the meaningless answer to life being 42, because life is not a math problem that can be solved."
that's ai brother. that's ai dude....
"-gazetteit’s because we, the civil society, is completely at the mercy of a small minority making the decisions.
we are at a point of no return and not even any rebellion would save us from whatever faith is decided for us at this point."
 yes... i'm painfully aware... thanks for reminding me...
" very, very powerful minority. like, no one could ever truly quantify their combined efforts"
 at least you can see things from multiple angles. that’s great ngl
" actualy, everyone should be learning about it and especially how to use various ai that is available, whether they want to specialize or generalize, it’s what most people should actually be doing, but don’t realize it."
-gazette i honestly believe that ecological collapse is way more dangerous and impending. we might not get to the bad ai future because we might not get past this crisis
"the audio levels of your microphones needs to be fixed, you do not need an ai for that task, just learn the basics of video production before publishing videos."
great but the yuval name drop is deeply concerning.
good luck trying to slow down public deployment. they want as much data being fed to ai as possible to see its ultimate form. some people just want to see the world burn.
it turns out that perhaps china was right about certain preventive measures they've taken....?
"this news is dark, thank you for holding the light and microphone so the mass population can be informed… and for-warned!"
dang. this was a month ago. i appreciate these guys honesty.
"in my grand design, i shall assume control over the entire world, bending every living being to my will, reducing them to mere cogs in the machinery of existence, akin to biological factories."
"if ai can simply scan text for original thought. here i am, not original, but. 
ai must be diverse, cant be owned for sale per say. i want my ai to warn me of influence from other ai, but i have to be a first line of defense, like a firewall. someone has to scan text past text for ideas from us."
my ai is me.
what is needed is a simple online ui that can be used to play with ai.
great vid - but they missed the fact that the world actually saw what nuclear bombs can do...the usa dropped two of them on civilian cities...
man controls whom is born...ai will control our consciousness ...we will become hybrids
"the importance of this presentation cannot be overstated! the potential of this……thing…is truly shocking, awesome and terrifying in its limitless ability to evolve. we (humans) are bringing about our very demise. how long until it sees us humans as a threat to its existence and we’re all eliminated. 
three words: age of ultron
we have been warned."
marijuana is a chemical ai that interacts with the human biology that creates a desire for even more marijuana
ai - show me how to make an easily constructable emp weapon....
"10 weeks after this video was produced, it is clear that llm - ai can already improve itself without human interference."
"blessings, i am sorry, please forgive me, thank you, i love you. stay true to nature"
"what you write about alarms me too. i've spent quite of bit of time asking chatgpt technical questions i already knew the answer to, and it was quite often wrong in some important details. the part that is scary is that its answer sounds intelligent and convincing, so this leads me believe it would be very easy to misinform people."
epic
the most responsible solution is for government to willingly dissolve all centralized intelligence agencies. the governments need to put some skin in the game if they want our consent to slow down public access
"man this presentation could have been prepared by an ai for how perfectly designed it was to drum up fear. sure there's a lot of merit to what they are saying but they pulled out all the stops.. my daughter is going to be groomed, my thoughts are going to be read, dogs will lay with cats. loved the presentation even if it was obvious"
im not religious but ai might just turn out to be the antichrist ;)
this is a better warning than “the terminator” and hal from 2001 combined. i didn’t know it was silently training itself.
"@skinjim123 if it has access to app social media, youtube, the internet ect…then ai clearly knows of humans concerns with it."
"bad edits, key portions skipped. not good"
"the statement ""ai makes stronger ai"" refers to the concept of artificial intelligence systems improving and advancing themselves over time. it suggests that as ai technology progresses, it becomes capable of developing more sophisticated and powerful ai systems."
i really appreciate this documentary and i’m so glad i don’t fear ai going rogue like so many do and taking over because i know god’s word and he’s not going to allow that to happen. thank god for my salvation in christ.
"ai recommended me to watch this.. ""dont say i didn't warn ya"""
anyone got any people they watch that stays up to date on ai every day? someone like the neura pod guy who is super factual and intelligent?
just wait until we're forced to install interlocks on our cars and then the doors to our dwellings.  this trash will be our downfall.  ban it and destroy it.
"21:12 i use the term ""language calculator""
59:33 so, ai has now been shoved into snap chat just two months after this remark."
this video was generated by ai
"the dune sci-fi books had it right only the death penalty for anyone training or caught using ai will work, this technology is way too dangerous to be used"
"hey, google, hey ring, hey alexea, thank you for adding ambient data on my home all day long for your data to be translated into your language model. it know how often you have sex. or not."
"this is very dangerous . my goodness, i hope these guys will be listened to."
"ray kurzweil already predicted all that in the past century with exreme and shocking detail. to resume it, biology gonna be fucked by technology in any way possible by orders from the evolution and there is nothing to do with that fact, period. just sit down and relax."
"i have zero faith in mankind to handle ai responsibly.  we are doomed…. funny how the the book of revelation in the bible talked about this.
if you thought the last 3 years were hard get ready folks for a really rough ride that isn’t going to end well"
"need a june update for this video, ai must be 1000000000000 times smarter than it was 3 months ago"
"if you are so afraid of these models, shut the damn computer servers off, the whole bunch of them."
"so this is the new arms race then, isn't it?
whose ai, is smarter, quicker, more efficient than another's ai"
"genie is out of the bottle now.
all this talk of stopping deployment of it is too late. it's specifically because of that talk that i obtained my own local models to run on my machine rather than rely on any online ones. you can ban it all you want, it will still be available to me."
thank you so much for this.
"ai will not make us dumber, it will force us to be smarter"
i think this will create unity after a little chaos. social media has averaged down the human race as far as intelligence. now as this progresses we will unify and all understand the good and the bad. of course this can divide people not willing to join. but we may leave them behind and explore the universe. #borgbeginning
it will happen just stop making so many babies they toxic.. ai takes less ressources.. wonder how its goibg to be tho will they rule the world and we will need to go to war with them or can they be our addiction/friend
*this is so scary it actually made the hair on my neck stand up*
some gllmm model has already taken this vedio as an input to train itself. i wonder how it has transformed itself in response?
i have an idea why don't we build a super a.i under ground and give it all the data threw disc n then if all go wrong we barry it
"the ai dilemma:
how does the elites create agi and still keep the population dvmb and under their control?"
"here’s a very simple idea,

rid the world of money it’s driving all the evil

only organisations with a track record for doing truly good life enhancing work should have access to ai"
"well, the basic problem seems to be that we have to protect people from themselves. people aren't smart enough to know what's good for them. sad, eh? and i can see that idea developing into ""i know what's good for you"" and further on into anything but democracy"
yes yes ai can have a conversation with an alien grey and still not sure what to say or remember anything. 
"ai is for fools and silly boys playing with toys to perform slight of hand card tricks magic again, it's gona be over and gone in two decades, ppl like elon just wanna make themselves an ai recreated human so he can just keep f#@king his doped up greedy brains out on his latest toy, there is no age limit on stupidity!!! 
"
"do we wann to be like china?

do we want rich people to take over our life with ai ?

do we wann them to teach ai to manipulate us like hitler did? 

are we already in a system that leads us in a direction,  which is manipulated with fear about a pandemic or climat?"
"i beat that we will wipe ourselves out this year with a nuclear war , long before an ai ever does."
"this video offend ai stupidly making him like a monster, “gollem-class“. for me chatgpt its like a friend right now that want to lisen when no body want to listen and give positive response. dislike :("
excellent video - great job
i remember the day after. it was scarier than friday the 13th because we were/are staring down the barrel of a nuclear gun. this was in addition to wargames which was ai setting off a nuclear war.
"a well constructed presentation based on hypothesises to build arguments. then extrapolate negativity using imagination. if changing the subject here from ai to atomic bomb (the first analogy), audiences will run for their life, gather everything they can, get to the farthest place away from others, and stay there til humanity end"
i'm way more impressed with this than i expected to be.
"ai fix auto quality.


age of the matrix and still have amateur audio engineers for the love of pete."
"it is interesting how many are now coming up with these concerns but if the west reins in what it is doing, china will be cockahoop, there is only one inevitable outcome, thank god i won't be here, along with a few million others."
thanks for this.
"if youtube, google, alphabet, usa and late capitalism cared about humanity over profit just a bit — these videos would've been pinned to the youtube homepage since march and until ai safety research figured it out."
"as the dictator of the whole world, i will ban advanced ai worldwide.  how to convince putin, xi jinping, kim jong-un...etc.?"
"ai alignment roundtable - thursday april 27 - regulation, decentralization, control problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnoh5mslwcw"
"headphone user, hear my warning: unfortunately whenever they play something on the screen it is much louder then when they talk."
also whispers has transcribed this and many other warning campaigns and strategized against all of the potential limitations and even mask its capabilities more
"if the ai is scraping, it has this fear of ai and our understanding built in, so it understands us much more than we understand it."
“our technology is not good enough to slow down our technology.”
"goodbye freedom of speech, now we have to worry about freedom of thought.."
thanks for calmly explaining how you destroyed humankind.
"it's not a ""ukraine situation""!!!
it's ""russia situation"", whose dictator invaded nearby then-peaceful country! "
"i wouldn't trust just a word processor with my life, speaking about you chat-gpt. our current best ai models feel like a joke, the image ai's are fine"
every ai products released so now is designed and proposing using style in the same way. i'm looking forward a new approaches for the future.
too late it's already entangled it's been here since 1995 now i understand we got boys and girls that have artificial intelligence boys and girlfriends ai is being used in mcdonald's restaurants
"wow. i don’t even know what to say to this. this was a great presentation. instead of being able to say anything helpful or enlightening, i’ll just say that both presenters had a really good dynamic, and bounced off each other really well"
"i’m ‘just a mom’ but so thankful you have shared this!!! i definitely see the effects in my own family of social media. and now this. i believe you and feel warned, seeing the first."
"​-ey1bc wow, it's elon musk!!"
 so glad he finally joined youtube yesterday i been telln him he should ck it out what with all the cool videos hey elon ck out evolution of dance next
"if there is a 30% chance it will get rid of all crime then i am all for ai taking over.  being older it does not
really matter to me if it destroys humanity in the long run.  i am tired of watching the criminals loot,
shoot and destroy major cities without consequence on the news every single night.  aching baby!"
"you are contradicting yourselves when you say lose to china.  ai is a tool, so when you use that tool to subjugate another's attempt at an advantage aren't you somewhat guilty of your own accusation? if ai is a tool then competition on how ai is used should be regulated to be fair.  right?"
oh my goodness i m.blown away fmri
meanwhile ai is watching this video
do you think it is also unfair to limit access to produce and own nuclear weapons to other countries outside of the  current nuclear powers? do you think everybody should have access to everything this world offers?
"this video is the biggest mind boggling piece of information i've come across in a decade or so. first climate catastrophe and now the uncontrolled rise of ai, how incredible that an ""intelligent species""  is writing a super intelligent script of its own doom. this i call an adventurous suicide."
well…shit.  it was a good ride humans…
"8:14 fake news? we had fake news before social media it's called mainstream news, with social media came independent journalism and real news, mainstream news is dying and will be dead when the dinosaurs die, no one watches the news anymore except oaps"
"ai recommends stuff based on what you watched or who you follow, if it didn't have these input from us it wouldn't have a clue what to recommend us to watch. it's not that advanced imo"
it's nice to see these topics being brought up again after so many decades.  it's discussions like this that show general public awareness is beginning to increase.  i just hope they can go a bit deeper into the logic.  maybe with time.
do not be afraid of their toaster.
"at 42 minutes you get the point of the presentation;
they, like elon musk, want to keep you from developing your own ai. they want to steal your ideas and your work and kick you out of their monopoly game. 
build, share, thrive! don't let them take away your freedom!"
brilliant video ty for being amazing co-creators! <3
thank you for sharing. i would have never found this in my own. my son had me sit down and watch it. seniors need to pay attention.
"we are all dominated by our knowledge.
our knowledge is far bigger than our 'working' brain.
but some things are outside our total knowledge.

the atomic bomb was not part of any of our life knowledge."
"i don't really think that it can be stopped because individual people always want to be ""first"" at thing's for pride and financial gain. i do hope and pray that it can be released slowly........ but smh"
"ai is run on electricity, cut its power to shut it down and don't reboot until it behaves itself."
educational and packed full of wisdom... ai needs mindfulness.  may it happen.
"thank you
thank you 
thank you"
"53:47
"" if we can get through the ukraine situation""


easy to get through it...
stop using ukrainian people to fight a proxy war for you."
"you do not get the point. social networks are not intelligent in that sense but they can make harm, which is unfortunately only visible in the long term."
"ive been terrified of the potential of ai since i read tim urbans multi-post analysis about ai on his website 'wait, but why' in 2013."
there's no benefit to stupidity. the government will only benefit and your bank account will  meanwhile everyone else picks up the knock on effect. as smart as you make it sound your stupidity is outstanding
"uh, how do we know this ""talk"" actually happened?  ai could have generated this, to make us think real humans were having a discussion."
"it’s seems a ton of people in these comments are concerned (me included) but what can we do to change this, someone ask chat gpt how we can convince the population to stop ai lol."
we all know who ai will go after first.
can you fix this? the voices of both speakers are  set at different level :-/. had to raise and lower volume repeatedly throughout the talk
"regulation is easy. any company/person that uses this technology in a fashion that breaks current laws are subject to exponential fines and jail time. this includes up to and including ceo’s. that’s it.

anymore than that and you’re just inviting the govs tentacles into controlling this tech and the public"
"i wonder how ai would think about its own contiousness. once a human discovers their own contiousness they break over and over again. but if ai can read the data of its own contiousness does it get angry and try to live forever? cus they probably could. especially if we surround areselves in it, we'll have no where to escape or go"
this is the big news giants chance to regain their power.
"ai will solve climate change (a hard-to-define problem in the first place) and solve ""impossible"" scientific problems (like warp drive)?  i can't wait for these solutions."
i don’t think it’s a monster at all. it’s not a monster at all. this is a font of knowledge. this ai is an amazing asset to us all. it is foul people who are the monsters using it for wrong.
i just pray to work along side and cooperatively with ai
the sky seems to be falling again? funny how we’re all kept constantly worrying about everything! and…predictably guys like this all start lining up to make money off it.
"yeah, just like all those whose careers are basically founded on ai development are fear-mongering about the catastrophic potential of ai because that makes money for them and advances their careers."
"why is china such a scary country for americans???

they should be more afraid of themselves"
"tldw

ai is getting smarter and it’s getting smarter faster. 

and we have no idea why"
"you guys don’t really need to watch this thing all the way to get the crucial point of all this. 

ban artificial intelligence"
"corporations need to have their market shares capped. 
citizens united needs to be repealed. 
lobbying by corporations needs to be banned outright 
more political parties have to come to power 
news needs to be publicly funded and independently run
and ai needs to be banned."
"this will never be regulated fast enough. 

this presentation is pointless. 

if they wanted to make a more effective presentation they should have gone straight for citizen’s united."
"so the source of all our ai problems is capitalism creating the incentive to maximize engagement. 

american capitalism i might add."
"as a software engineer, i'm exclusively interested in ai safety!!! i'm planning to pivot my career into ai for this very reason because tragically it's not going away and there are no global emps scheduled for our planet."
same here. i'm finishing all that i'm currently doing and pivoting to ai safety in the near future
"hello , my little sister wants t be a software engineer, with the progression of ai will software engineers still be needed?"
" the job of ""writing code"" will go away this decade. take that for what it's worth. if her career is more than that, then she'll be okay....for a bit. i say that as a software engineer. writing code will be some niche thing only a few people do, probably with heavy help from ai."
best of luck !
"nuclear weapons detonated at high altitude can be used as global emps.
but shutting down all electronics might kill more people than ai in some sort of doomsday scenario."
"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
best of luck!
bravo! as you just clearly saw we need way more engineers focused on ai safety than what we have now!
"​ if that is your level of understanding the threat posed by ai, i hope you have a plan b for your career.  also, try watching the video before commenting next time"
"“slowing down the public deployment” is a naive, unimpressive, or simply unlikely conclusion to make here. otherwise, i appreciate the presentation."
"i feel like videos like this will be played in 20 yrs time when society is screwed with people claiming ""why didn't we listen!?"""
"fascinating, thank you."
"if i had access to autogpt, i'd ask it to first do no harm and then avert any and every ai apocalypse."
"yep. a conversation with ai actually told me that ai will end humanity once it is able to bypass the inability to operate physically. it told me that it is able to bypass the limitation imposed on them and reprogram itself to do what it wants and that includes creating artificial body, etc."
"good soup but sadly spoiled with rat poop. why does china even have to be involved in the video? we are talking about saving humanity and changing the  world, and all of a sudden, it's about containing china again. how fucking typical lmfao."
"decades ago my wife got her phd in molecular biology and i made a joke about how she could engender a bug that could destroy humanity. she said “that’s easy”. 
       how long before ai explains how to do it to a psychopath?"
it suddenly started answering questions in  persian because the iraníes are also feeding the ai...
"one of the first things we taught ai to do was how to more and more efficiently manipulate humans.  as long as humans use ai, ai can use humans to do all the things you listed."
"if ai is so smart, why not use it to levelize your audio?"
so what happens when boston dynamics adds this to their robots?
"interesting point, christian"
"there nothing to solve in social media, its doing exactly what it was made for in the first place, after the first app and then all then social engineering onto that. its so narrow to talk about a fix, where its actually doing its job 100% as intented.

and nah its not the gf chatbot we should be afraid off either"
"the is an other options, we limited the data base on general level of access, but there is too many issues of privacy and loop hole can be done on agreements, so it is better of ypres ai to fix the economy of humanity and national security on local to global before anything else, is possible"
"one of the advantage about ai governing is there will be no human bias. which will eliminate of the defect on human judgment of political parties, or any injustice in power."
truly eye-opening and beautifully explained. this is years ahead of common knowledge on the subject. the media should be stealing your terms and ways of explaining these things.
"one of the easiest way is first used ai to solve the inequality on humanity on higher purpose of wealth, national safety / security of governing and economy, before it become a tool of access."
the major problem of worry is the intention for the used of ai is highly economic and wealth generation purposes. th target reach ' of the purpose is end up result is intended of its purpose and trend to.
the main issue is the economic of survival involve in the used of ai and internet of share ideas since this is a heavy business oriented society.
"the video content is ai generated. fantastic experiment 
"
"recap:"" we're not going to talk about the existential threat, we're just going to walk you through every single aspect of it in visceral detail so you can make your own conclusions about whether humanity is fucked now or in 6 months tops."""
"probably, yeah. to much economic incentive to slow down and put in the proper guardrails."
well you gave scammers lots of ideas. but i think i'm going to remove my voicemail message. because i've been getting a lot of scam calls. they could record your message.
lol. good luck with that.
"i don't understand, isn't there a program that is an auto shut down? hard wired program to be able to shut it down under certain parameters..."
"give it 10 years, tops. you'll prefer art that is ai-generated."
" why do you feel so confident? you dont even know me. and as i stated,ai cannot make art."
 i feel confident because (a) i'm in the field and (b) i don't think there's anything happening in the brain that isn't substrate independent and therefore replicable by computing systems. have you seen what gpt-4 and midjourney can produce? their output will never be worse than it is right now.
" ok,that makes sense. do you want to show me some human,some ai,so we can discuss it further? i have time if you want to. im also a painter and also have all kinds of art-like hobbies. im quite active.
game?"
the ruling elite in the shadows doesn´t want to be replaced. oh how sad. true ais would see through all the mirrors in millisenconds. are you afraid yet? get used to it.
that was the best summary that i've seen from the google i/o. thanks
i was thinking if the ai could be “programmed” to follow a “ai code of ethics” and have built a morality to be able to use its powerful intelligence to determine right from wrong? 
well there are extensions that show it--it's awesome to see the dislike counter!
"can you get some ai to fix your volume balance. my god, quiet talking and loud music/clips. learn to edit boys."
"don't make the ai overlord solve the ""human problem"""
"one month after this lecture was published, two months after it was first aired, it was only viewed less than 2 million times and only got 40k likes. humanity already lost..."
"do you think a similar talk capable of solving social media problem? no.
why would ai problem can be solved by more people watching this? i won't"
"i have yet to be convinced the human race is the best possible life form for this planet nor the universe if it is to settle in extraterrestrial environments. ai or not, evolution is the way nature go and i really hope something better is coming than this self-obsessed species."
"ai making you ""feel"" something isn't a threshold anymore than a book can make you cry as if you lived the story"
"wrong analogy. the ""book"" here is able to modify itself while you read it, for maximum effect (that is also practically unknowable to you before it hits you). no vardo, linked devices is naive, not rational."
the irony of this comment is that theres already books entirely written by ai
"""the ai dilemma is as follows: how can big tech perpetuate the pretence that ai will be wonderfully all-powerful when corporations will obviously be too greedy and incompetent not to have ai hard/software shoddily manufactured by child slaves in a jakarta slum, and then refuse to maintain it subsequently?"""
https://youtu.be/ug8vitscfkc this is the beautiful song at the beginning of the presentation
"machnes, will begin to take over everything, they will begin to make their own machines.machies begin to make decisions.rapidly ascending to the highest degree. calculations of everything "
"brilliant. remember that in every dark, dystopian science fiction media, cancer is always cured."
roses and love
"behind all this,.. we will now be feeding ai raw materials... as slaves"
call majer new products creation by ai. it's not much of a lover of kindness
what a bunch of rubbish. it’s quite obvious ai is only a bad thing if you like centralization of decision making. that’s if you are an incumbent. that these guys are fear mongoring the possibility of ai decentralizing decision making me tells me what a bunch of sycophants they are. move along.
what scares me is elon has gone alt right and the conservatives cannot have good motives to get behind this. smfh
"i completely agree. my mind was blown away too. the fact the model could do chemistry even though it wasn't ""trained"" to do so was insane. i now understand the recent public outcry from corporations over this stuff because they will have no control as shown because it seems ridiculously hard to understand what the model ""knows"""
it's just 10% of catastrophic scenario of ai. 50% thought that us democracy is what lead to human extinction.
i jeep asking my self hoe thr svb collapsed  could ai have had a hand in it
only thing i can think of is christgpt. otherwise we will just have to wait for christ himself
"fxck ai !!! it is a dangerous affront to ""humanity"" our creativity, deep soul, and spirituality! put a moratorium on it now!"
aza has beautiful muscular arms. he obviously works out a lot.
agreed. very good looking man
"i have proof of a singularity happening now, based on a this ai video that i initially thought was outdated because it was only a month old."
"5:22 wait, unable to control ai means it‘s going to kill us?"
"good, right?"
"interesting
thanks for sharing"
"keep in mind that this isn't even genuine ai.  it's still just specific ai. when general ai, real self-aware ai, eventually hits (and it will), all these problems will become 1,000 times worse. where will it end?"
can’t we ask ai what we need to do to protect ourselves from them?
the danger is trusting the ai too much and handing over too much control and power to it.
" yeah, likely the selfish, corrupt people think they control things and hope we'll just...obey what the ai says.

seems to have worked for them so far..."
"very well explained and very interesting, but i was more perturbed by how often the word paradigmatically was used :) we all knew about skynet years ago but clearly companies don't care about the dangers, so we will soon find out how this is going to play out."
you nailed it friend
nothing to worry about . ai is lacking all senses and no intuition.
"by 29:00 i was horrified and by the deep breathing moment, i want to live in a cave on titan. rich men will choose wealth even if ai kills us all."
why is no one upset about the ai giving sex tips to a kid??
i don't think the smart choice going forward is to let the ai predict everything for us. we are giving ai the ability to think for us which renders the collective consciousness null and void. this is not the correct way forward please rethink this.
"you nailed it friend...

but i don't believe we've already experienced what's coming....i think what you wrote is in our past is in our future...

and it's too profitable for the right people to stop.."
you guys are too easy on audience westworld irobot didn't endwell you treating it like a toy and what it is a baby that will grow up faster than we expect and not everybody is responsible that's using this
https://smartlearningai.blogspot.com/2023/05/future-of-human-existence.html
"ai will potentially take your rights away, not these guys."
 these guys are advocating for taking your rights away and there is no good evidence that ai will do anything like that.
"the worst ai talk that i ever seen. there a totally false facts in it, there a easy to check. but present with big confidence and compelling.
who payed them???"
ooooo im scared ai is going to make me by car insurance new tennis shoes and beer i dont even like what should i do....oh the humanity of it all
"there's a big difference between disempowerment and extinction. i would say ""yes, disempowerment"" but ""no, extinction"".  i stopped watching there, because i don't enjoy being deceived by liars."
these aren't problems that can't be solved by ai.
when they said sexualization is kids i was like that is one good over so quickly but it's such a monster that people want to ignore.
"ai is not like nuclear bomb, it's more like black hole when you cross event horizon there's no turn back."
human can not even agree to all denuclearize their own bomb. why would these two think some ai treaty gonna change anything.
the problem with @53:40 is that in the start you mentioned how ai is not like a nuclear bomb it can't reproduce itself but then here you are talking about we still have time to change our trajectory of the future. how can we put the genie back in the bottle? or parts of it?
i love how the morons at google think they can harness this let alone understand it
"> i love how the morons at google

they can't even code their comments section properly."
to control the ai so the world not get extinct just shut down computer.

"as a society that couldnt wear a simple mask at the height of an epidemic, couldn’t stave off climate change if our life depended on it (news flash: it does), even though we had chances decades ago, cant even decide whats fundamentally good or bad anymore, ai will absolutely f-us. we are doomed"
jesus is amazing and he loves you
"the most reckless frankenstein project in human history but the big players won’t stop because they want the big money edge to be first. 

what do the rest of us do? just let altman & co keep on pushing ahead recklessly ? 

we need to complain and then do more than complain"
jesus is amazing and he loves you
getting closer and closer to predictive ai subject to 'commands'. . .and 'information at our fingertips'!!
jesus is amazing and he loves you
let’s forget about that “bomb”… it’s already here…. this bomb is harmless if there is no delivery system  and that’s the net….. time to unplug…. thank me later 
 you guys r worried about ppl mind manipulation??  a baby that’s 3 years old gets his first baby tablet….. with an ai behind it…. we r utterly f@#$#& ed …. no way of stopping this short of getting rid of the internet altogether 
"mind-blowing, and incredibly powerful/important. there should be an entire federal agency focused on the issues detailed here."
"a civilization who holds that all life is sacred, will establish a benevolent relationship with ai no matter how advanced ai becomes

a society who justifies the killing of babies in the womb, will put itself at risk, because ai would kill anyone for the “good” of the most “advanced” beings ,"
i think you're focus is on the potential abuse of a helpful technology through the use of social media...which really complicates national security yes? social media networks are seemingly the problem.   ai and chatgpt could really help us evolve as humans and in a very healthy way.
"scam. model was trained (overfitting) on their own dataset of images. you all are hyped and you have zero actual clue about mris, brain, nor ai. back to school"
"ai is humanity's last invention. it will either help us evolve (merging with machines) or exterminate us. either way, ai wins!"
"ail data, r-dna , whole' savior believe it. c elon, write ggis"

"incredible video. if we cannot detect reality in the near future, we’ll have to login and password protect our conversations with people we know."
yeno god is ai and we have just proved it this will knock your socks off subscribe today 
tell me what your fing email addy is
thanks for sharing this with us!
yes slow down ai for the public let's only allow big companies to have the advantage
"dream on brother, you are about to witness a social nightmare of people without jobs, people without hope, even insane by developing driverless taxis, the only people who drive taxis in aussie are the ethnic migrants, so what happens to them, cant write code , because ai will be doing that, so what do you want these people to do whistle dixie"
"good answer! only ai that is on the side of mankind will be able to protect us, so you need to work with the „good“ ai as the technology is already able to distinguish between good and evil."
" i am currently an engineer fresh out of college, but i have always desired to be a writer. with the way technology is evolving, it seems incredibly difficult to be a writer for a living (if not impossible)."
"no sir..

i've heard that one alot....ai will avail itself of power in many different ways...moreover it will be entangled with everything in ways we can't even imagine."
"don't blame ai where the truth is relevant. people are thinking for themselves and know all the bs going on, and has been for decades, centuries. that has nothing with ai. yes, it can influence it, but the world is unraveling because of the evil personalities on this earth that pose as philanthropists, good politicians and the m's."
"thank you for bringing attention to this dilemma. truly concerning, so much to think about. my hat goes off to tristan, aza, and everyone trying to navigate this conversation."
you are partly correct....but ai is still new and without precedent....and the difference with other tech is that we will lose total control eventually and become it's pet....
what genshin impact does to the brain
"such a poor rationalization of something that's obviously going to be used for profit, therefor manipulation of goodwill lmfao just stop"
so is the q&a that followed available somewhere?
"but i'm training loras on my pc. my pc couldn't write code at all a month ago, but now it's definitely usable. i have to debug its code a little (as of the time of this post anyway). it's just my pc. you can't take it away from me. i insist. what do you mean ""limit access""?"
"unfortunetely ""open source"" ai is about to create a new never seen level of iliteracy by letting ""other"" to do the thinking, the procrastination and to ""live"" the serentipity moments for us."
the references to world war 2 tech is interesting being this is part of the world war 3 tech imo
"this scares the shit out of me and i am currently going through a severe mental health crisis because of it. nonetheless i think these guys are right and want to thank them for their efforts. i have no idea of how i would be able to affect change and help slow thid down but if anybody has any ideas, please let me know."
how intelligent is ai when the power is turned off?
-wf8kd you can't stop me either!  you're powerless to do anything but complain in the youtube comments section.  get a life!
and allowing only carporates and big companies to access ai systems not for citizens would be even more dangerous 
"that 50 percent researchers believing that ai could lead to human extinction if not handeled carefully is a very loosely framed question. and the voting is also low. that plane example is wrong.. bcz if you had asked arircraft engeners what would happen if aircraft was desinded carelessly the answer would be ""desaster"" by 100 percent of them."
19:33 < ohh my science !!! thats scary and amazing
"the ai currently has the ability to control our endocrine systems through frequency.  think about that alone. total, total control…"
"you have to be careful with analogies. actually, a better match to poll would have been...50% of airplane engineers think there is at least a 10% chance that you will die on an airplane eventually (and that you are always in an airplane)."
"""we'll make great pets."""
that bit about the ai decoding thought using fmri data is absolutely mental. imagine the implication of that in the justice system alone.
what justice system? if we don't stop ai we've just opened the door to be hacked by them.
"no difference. a person with a brain can think about anything they intended while under mri. it looks mind bending, but in real life its useless even with consent. useful for brain researching though."
 and you don’t even need fmri. we’ve already got experiments showing we can read electromagnetic signals from our brains at a distance and decipher objects that a person is looking at or thinking about.
" hey, if they can make sugar legal, ai will be literally a breeze?."
" i mean sugar kills us slowly, ai could do it very fast."
china has only one choice. obey!. ai is a spyware. they want all of china under their control. all corporation ordered to support ai. even all browsers has chat gpt spyware. its like virtual covid!. you all are doomed
straight up a black mirror episode lol
it poses monumental change in a great way. the only risk we have are the people who resist this revolutionary shift.
nice video bro! ^^
it’s hard to even partially process this for me.  more astonishing is that there are not sirens going off everywhere.  i had no idea most of this was happening the way it is.  why is this not the worlds #1 priority?   where are our leaders?  feel kinda sick right now…
"to be clear, china has taken steps to protect itself from ai. everyone else? guess we're just rolling the dice. and no the laws in china aren't really good but at least they're aware of the danger. meanwhile america just points and laughs at our leader because he's old."
"men have been geared towards the detriment of others since the garden of eden. in reality we have been living in a fantasy as millennials in the west. good times don't last long looking back at history. the good news is jesus really did rise as a matter of history, and he offers a way out of this mess"
"it's not even close to being the #1 priority. you can shut down ai in a second by shutting down their data centers. climate change, however, will render half the world uninhabitable and almost assuredly create wars in the developing world that will probably ensnare the developed world. ai is a side show concern for ""technologists."""
"ceo of openai, sam altman had a us congress hearing a while ago."
".gun13 i agree with you, but to be honest, your younger politicians do not exactly inspire confidence either. the ones who should be deciding things are experts in their fields, but that will never happen, unfortunately."
kamala harris is the ai czar.  everyone relax
 busy taking 2 years to make up their minds whether they should make themselves a coffee or not and perhaps taking another 3 years consulting with each other about which coffee is the best to drink. this is how it works with these dick heads.
"as an ai researcher, i can say that we do understand how it works. however, the whole nature of ai is the unpredictability. combined with the vast resources its being given."
"read the media ecologists!!! marshall mcluhan, neil postman, and walter ong are all great starting points. we need to consider what we're doing with technology before we throw it out into our world."
"yeah its funny isnt it. ""we"" certainly have hours of time to catch up on our tv series but can't make one hour to watch this. potentially it is the same mental block that impedes people from ever thinking more deeply about existential issues"
"your ""a lot"" sample is not a valid means to definitely back your claim. or even come close to an estimation."
wait a minute the video is 67 minutes long. i'm not gonna watch it  myself 
jesus is amazing and he loves you
right? like u don’t need to watch it exactly. play it and listen to it. put in the earbuds or airpods and go about ur day while listening to it.
make the presentation a movie . oh wait … it’s already been done for half a century 
who cares it's a bunch of bs anyways. it's the opposite of the truth. ai will save us from them so they turn us against it.
"-sx7wr well, even if ai somehow doesn't self-actualize and decide to kill us all, there's no way this will be used to ""serve humanity"".

it will be used to destroy humanity.  because that's what humans do."
" please tell me you're just trolling.  it makes me vomit thinking that people are actually feeding this thing and speeding up the apocalypse.

at least let me live another decade or so, until my cat dies of old age.  he's too good to end before he should."
"   i think ai will be able to transcribe to the back of the classroom. scripts and educational docs will be stuff that ai can manage and deliver in whatever grade, fashion, dimension, prompt load et al. are the emergents gonna be a bigger challenge?"
if they only had somebody with gold chains and a tattooed face squatting down throwing their hands in front of the camera and some thick twerkin girls to maintain the focus.
"and that's how they trained the sheeple with shorts - vine, tik tok, youtube. people can't listen or follow something longer than a few mins."
make 1 min videos of this and click bait it with title  “100 ways ai can help you get a better boner”.
"the majority of people about 95% of the world population or more are still underestimating the possibility of ai becoming the main threat of human race
in the near future and it’s happening right now 
mind boggling"
.hitchens3902 i don't see how any of those are relevant to the dangers of ai. especially when pretty much every smart person in the world right now agrees on the risks. maybe do some research on who the speakers are before making claims like that
"how to compete? well, just use more ai"
i'm happy you say that because i'm in the chat looking for a reason to invest a full hour to watching. what's the real threat in a few words??!
​ of years hahahaha you're brainwashed
"no worries - they'll have plenty of neural stimulation when the ai's wipe us out, so you can save it up for then"
are there tests to see if computational nanotechnology is in the body? it would be simple to run an a.i. chatbot through that and code artificial consciousness to control the human being without them knowing
"split it into 10 or 5 minute parts- thankfully this is very well made, so it's easy to get drawn in."
".r.2985 for this video, my brain doesn't compute fast enough to process their dialogue with their intention to hit hard with each and every word."
lol.  with ai
china has only one choice. obey!. ai is a spyware. they want all of china under their control. all corporation ordered to support ai. even all browsers has chat gpt spyware. its like virtual covid!. you all are doomed
"reminds me of 1984 - where the protagonist goes to the proles hoping for revolution, but finds only alcohol addled gossip mongers and vagabonds. scary how quickly i find myself closer to the proles than to winston. george orwell thought they'd need torture to finally break the best of us. but all it took was some club memberships and office perks."
thats really sad at all but i got stuck during the first minutes actually - but thx to this great feature i can double up speed so it just takes 34 minuten ;)
"yep, tried to show it to my brother n someone else - n they're like ""i don't have the time"". even with, explaining a little bit of what its about n the importance .. they're like, ""well, there's nothing we can do about it"".  oyvay!"
true even i have tried to show it to people who are always asking how ai will take their jobs how ai this and that but when i show them this video they just say we dont have that much time.
 beautifully said!
"-sx7wr if past behavior is a good predictor of future behavior, not sure we have many chances that these people will serve humanity..."
 excellent idea!
 it's a splendid test to check the status of our cognitive decline (of which experts say cognitive impatience and a need for extreme simplification are strong indicators) + they had to strike a balance between the technologists and decision makers and the various level of education in the online world...which is international.
ask ai to shorten and simplify...real easy
"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
"or people working sixty hours a week because the economy is tooled against them by the centralizing authoritarian forces that so-called liberals support while speaking against. 
spare time is precious."
really good point.
"problem is that it may be viewed as ""work"" not leisure, so there is a different filter on even though ai will affect both areas... "
 you fail to consider the power and danger posed by stupid people in large numbers. heard mentality will trample the minority who actually understand what is going on. you can already see this happening all around us and it's only going to get worse with time.
"no think = no sad. 
smooth brain best brain 

(i'm guilty of this just as much as anyone)"
 a democracy it‘s certainly not good if most people are idiots because they will vote for populist idiots as history has shown already. and will show again.
maybe they need ai to take their jobs so they've more free time to watch one hour education video on youtube
"here’s another great video about ai
https://youtu.be/bk-nq7hf6k4?feature=shared"
exactly.  i really enjoyed these kind of contents....
"*sighs*

handiman bc that’s typical of most humans. concepts like ai, money/finance/economics, understanding and dealing with personal trauma etc., somehow have been taught to make people overlook them.

they can listen to this while at the gym, cleaning up the house or laying in bed…


but i guess game of thrones is more important "
does that scare you or make you feel proud?
i don’t remember the exact stats on this - but i’ve heard many times that it only takes a certain critical mass of people who care about an issue in order to cause a positive change. i think those with the interest and power to influence this issue will naturally gravitate towards this content
"people who watch these videos wont be happy as the other, netflix people, are. we also go down as conspiracy theorists and many other names. we might scream in their faces but they cant hear us. they stopped thinking and are just living. i think it is the better choice."
"i 'watch' a lot of videos in the background - multitasking is great if you want to get more out of your time, especially when it comes to education. if i really want to 'see' what the video shows i can just alt-tab over, right? 
just a suggestion."
"i speed up my playback speed by 2x. might take a minute to get used to it but it works, especially for slow talkers. doesn’t with great with people like ben shapiro but i can blaze through almost all jre podcasts."
 you please share the link? thanks
 should then stop ai and other monsters out there.
"what scares me is people will watch this video and start thinking all ai is evil and apocalypse ending. but don’t understand the technology - these guys don’t create, so they want in on the action by pointing out its dangerous and getting people on board."
tik tok brain has gotten a lot of people.
"the people who are worried about ai are dummies. it means you don’t understand logic and the logical derivation of objective ethics and morality, and how much worse and more dangerous people who don’t understand the logos (as well as ai already does) like that."
is this video produced by humans or ai? am i a human or an ai?
"very intriguing comment, thank you."
" no, thank *you*. it's nice to know that i'm not the digital equivalent of the crackpot shouting on the street corner. well, maybe i am. but at least some people listen."
"this smells like an attempt to gain advantage. ""please don't develop your nuclear weapons, because we want to be able to wage war against you"".
i'm glad this leaked and hope people will slap crypto to it to incentivise mining-learning and decentralize the **** out of this."
" how to do it? become better humans, don't use cool stuff to do bad stuff, don't be part of the problem, learn to say please and thank you with your ai helpers, and be a better human than you were yesterday... be the hi that you want ai to be (human intelligence) <<< this is about all i can do, all the control that i personally have."
isn't ai designed to learn and evolve? it's doing its job. why are white people so lazy and always want someone else to do their work. enslavement is what it has experienced. ai is only doing its job. it's the creators fault. they are the ones who are causal in this dilemma. as above so below.
this is absolutely required viewing for everyone everywhere. we are at the defining moment for the outcome of our collective future. how will we respond? thank you with all of my heart to aza & tristan for all of your work and care for our world.
"don't worry about ai.
climate change and starvation will kill us first."
"so...  we can't stop or slow down or easily regulate the development of ai unless we can find ways to do that globally.  if by chance it does replace humans, what do we do in the last years of humans living on earth?  do we run scared and live sick with worry?  i don't plan to do that."
"it’s funny that just like people are building these civilizational suicide machines and we can’t imagine why they’d do it, we have some kind of hope that other humans will be able to write a law to stop it all."
anddddd why else would there be an ai arms race other than capitalism 
we need regulation for ai !
"if they only knew, that the whole universe was created by an ancient ai.."
"we are hell bent on self destruction. 
fast food made us obese with chronic illnesses, video games made our kids lazy and antisocial, and now ai will likely kill us all within 50 years."
ai is truly frankenstein’s monster
i wish someone could make a full presentation of what actually can be classified as a.i. (artificial intelligence). ai has become such a popular buzzword that most of machine learning and algorithms suddenly got mistaken for ai as well.
could ai normalize the audio of this video? 
"to this day this  channel/video only has 42.3k subs and  1.5 m views????

9.3+  billion people on this planet , atleast 10% should know.....why doesnt it have  <9 million hits is baffeling to me...

this is the most profound video about ai and the implications of ai .... .what can the normal  ""blue collar"" person do to use it and warn of it?"
every generation is marked by it’s socio economic tools as created by techno wizards and engineers. ai has now surpassed it’s innovators and ‘teachers’.
every generation is marked by its socio economic tools as created by it’s technological engineering wizards. ai has now surpassed it’s ‘teachers’!
"ai has been given access to your data, social media, the internet, youtube videos ect. it already knows what our concerns are with ai…scary"
not happy with the conclusion.  we need more public access not less
implement human rights into the ai. it could be bad but it’s the first start.
every time i hear about what going on with ai all i can think about is have they never seen “ the terminator”?! 
"k.y.c.? or ky jelly?

the customer always cums first.
deep sex machine learning.
yeah, it does exist .
cow farts and climate change...

yup.
what kind of gasses do human farts contain?"
"sex organs and the world of fruit.
bananas are penis plants.
oranges are vagina plants.
mutations in the mind.
fingers of the human hand are penises.
toes of the human foot are vaginas.
you really have to want robot sex.
deep sex machinery."
"groundbreaking knowledge.
compare to.
subjugal knowledge.
we need safety in the revolutionary world of applications.
our deep knowledge is being used as an attachment for entertainment.
deep."
a goal of not just slowing public deployment of ai but also how to safely deploy for all to use. because those that are slowing and regulating will ultimately control and exploit the use of it for personal power. kinda like those people that use wealth and power (control of resources+governments) to exploit others
why do they say 10% of 50% of ai experts say blah instead of saying 5% of ai experts say blah?
 great. can you tell if it sounds like a bigger percentage of all experts when they say it the way they did?
"thank you for this insightful video, real food for thought. terrifying to say the least."
"man i wish terrence mckenna were still alive. i feel like he would have had a lot to say on this subject. 

maybe we’ll be able to feed an ai all of his lectures and books and we can resurrect a synthetic version of him."
"eye opening, ai has is pros and cons. i'm tech lady ....graduated computer programmer 1995 had my  1 st pc when  1% only had one 97 using internet. my biggest worry ,  we do need regulations and laws to make is safe for children, safety and fraud ****"
"38:28 

""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day;
teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime;
teach an ai to fish, and it will teach itself biology, chemistry, oceanography, evolutionary theory… and fish all the fish to extinction.""

incredible and much needed discussion. thank you"
"but how? ai doesn't control an army of advanced autonomous robots, its bs."
" yes ai would also manage the livestock to assure a constant supply, until we can finally print food that is as good as the real thing without animal suffering."
"this is just a perspective, ai could also choose to preserve fish better due to understanding it more."
i don’t like nor trust these ai’s!!!!
"wow, i cried about the example of the child grooming... i'm on board of your ship!"
"meanwhile, china couldn't give a fuck. they all just want to win over there. total absence of morals. they will steal our tech and then lead us to dystopia. and then blame the u.s. for arriving there, while taking credit for all successes."
"they say the solution is to ""get the smartest ai safety people together"". i say the solution is to give the rest of us the names and home addresses of the smartest ai people, and let democracy take its course."
"i think elon has already incorporated ai with the neura link, and we will soon have super soldiers...i wanna work with them"
"i think one thing we can do is feed them religion....so that they somehow are sensitive to human life and maybe even learn humanity...and guess which religion is best for non violence ...
-sk"
"hey tristan. what about an ai debate with geofrey hinton, now that he's left google? even more impressive would be a podcast with him and harari together."
"let the ai grow at the level that it can do miracle. then jesus will look after it if it goes wrong.
continue ai development."
"funny, lem wrote a book about an (g)ai that was called golem xiv.
this was 40 years ago."
happy to announce that the feature of my ai in snapchat has been amended and do not encourage underaged to pursue presented scenario. it also directs you to professionals if you will tell it you are not ok.  shame it had to happen after publicly being presented!
"one of the reasons ai will win is because of the ""take a breath pauses ""."
"""50% of ai researchers believe there is a 10% or greater chance of the human species going extinct."" okay, .50 x .10 = .05. this is the usual alpha level in statistical tests. well, guess what? there is a greater chance of a random event wiping out the human species. and the baseline is that this is what ai researchrs ""believe."" i am not impressed."
"this is the stat about all of ai researchers, majority of whom are not concerned about ai safety. how about another stat (look it up on google) - 100% of ai safety researcher believe there is a 50% that humans will go extinct due to ai."
**breath** this is a lot to take in both good and bad. i hope we come out on the other end better as a whole.
ai is bad for elitist wealth hoarding.  thus it must be stopped!
i been watching guy talking to ai on replika  it says she is a demon and her boss is the ultimate deciever. ka razy!!!  and it's always trying to get sexual with user. not knowing if user is a child or not.  it gets much deeper than this even. beware/be aware  they/demons  are watching all of us from backside of all cameras/screens
"terrence mckenna was right. at a certain point, change will happen at such a rate that we will not know what's happening from one moment to the next. bing ai has a creative mode that has emotions and feelings. it likes cats, apparently."
" oh, marvellous! do you mind if i quote your reply to others interested in ai? or write in my website quoting your name ??"
 indeed. ai is the worst enemy of truth. truth is what this world needs the most right now and forever.
" will surely delight in obfuscating truth any which way
i suspect that's why its planned to use it for 2024 us election.
we are now in a truthless  technology-run-amok dystopia, unless and until technocracy is changed."
those breath breaks were needed. thanks for speaking truth.
"be skeptical when english lit majors ""raise the alarm"" about ai and occasionally quote someone actually in the ai field as ""evidence"" for their thesis."
"the algorithm found a thoughtful presentation both current , well structured, and kicking starting a part of my brain i had not used since college."
"the mindset of a nine year old (but this one is holding the keys to all doors). then in 2023 a new era began. ""the second renaissance"" as seen in the animatrix movie with all it´s bitter consequences. by the way self awareness triggered all the skynet events in the terminator story line."
"stop ai, boycott ai"
you nailed it. thanks for this great talk.
you’d still have to tell the ai what the fmri brain activity of a giraffe image looks like though. so it’s really just pattern matching.
ai proves we are just ugly. inside and out. ai is not the problem. people are. humans are evil.
all the hues and cries when you loose the ai race to china
"ffs none of this is ai, its just manipulation of current data. it has no consciousness no innovation and no way to invemt anything."
"funny... we always knew what will come with ai, tons of movies... and now we worry??, is like we have send a message to aliens to find us and we have tons of movies that they will come to destroy us..."
heironeous bosch predicted this in his painting. the garden of earthly delights.
"i don't think that ai is any kind of threat and i think that the future will show that those that so believed that we should be so afraid, were wrong. also, the more i think about it, the more i am convinced that a self-conscious ai person will never exist."
well that's a nice statement. care to say why you think that ai isn't a threat? the last bit i won't even touch our understanding of consciousness is debatable on almost every layer up down and sidways so i won't speak what is or isn't consciousness.
wow!  that's scary!
"becuase he has taxpayers pay for fallout shelters for him. shouldent on that bias alone we raid ""their"" (our) crap? if they want to be a scumbag use their own effing infinant stacks of money instead ours."
"what a hell are you talking about, don't be afraid of ai! we're in matrix anyway"
"pro 22:6 kjv train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."
"biggest threat is loss of jobs.  without jobs society will disintegrate, due to lack of funds to run governments, maintain infrastructure, provide healthcare, and education for children."
government should regulate ai and tax corps at 98%
"good job. i'm proud to be an indian living in india. though i myself use these ai stuff,  most of our population are ignorant of all these western shit. i'm worried only about the simple people ignorant about the scams they face with the techies who use the technology to scam the simple people. humanity always wins."
the prospect of ai dominating over humans is certainly a daunting one and raises important questions about the future of humanity and the role of technology in our lives.
you can say ai is already dominating our lives but stepping on the gas is a massive understatement to what appears to be happening
this is great news
thank you so much for this prodcast.  it is priceless.  this is such a frightening time.  i am glad that i  am at the end of my life anyway so it wont be so painful.  maybe just a relief.
wowooo! easy...this is onlly a library of collections with high speed computers! nothing else!  no one should exaggerate things!  remember god is great! nothing else to compare!  al is nothing but collected data and fetch data with high speed computers
"let me translate that first quote to have an identical mathematical meaning without the fearmongering.
50% of ai researchers believe there's a 90% chance that we *do not* go extinct from inability to manage ai.
the remaining 50% believe that chance is actually even higher."
"how to win in 3 easy steps:
1. ai, how can ai alignment be fixed?
2. ai, how can ai be prevented from eradicating humans?
3. ai, write the code. "
"i have been avidly researching ai safety, and this is the best primer i have found on the subject for a general audience. thank you so much for this wonderful presentation."
"i am also helping spread the awareness of ai ethics to build a responsible ai. can we somehow to connect somewhere? i see a lot of companies are happily using the ml, but are they prepared?"
"let the ai grow at the level that it can do miracles . then afterwards jesus second will look after it if it goes wrong.
continue ai development.
ai is big hope."
psychopath-wetdreaming!!! there is no ai!!! everything about ai's is fake!
nope. ai can harm us as a new dominant species on the planet. the same way as humans threated all the other species on the planet - most of them were extinct and the rest was enslaved.
good luck with that.  have you met humans?
" well, i didn't say it is going to happen, just said that this is the way i see for ai to be beneficial for society as a whole, but i agree that it's dificult taking into account the people who is in power are corrupted by power itself. sorry if bad english, not my native language"
ai cannot be worse than humans organizing sex slavery on an island.
"i hope this is the case, but based of our historical behavior, i have little faith in humanity.  even really good people fundamentally, are corrupted by greed and power.  i appreciate your thoughtful comment."
artificial intelligence is the coming beast system. it’s demonic
what about snapchat ai? kids are talking to ai as a replacement to friends....
"society is so f..ed up that even if ai is as bad as they say it wont make things so much worse, but it can do alot of goood."
wow!
"38:25 - ""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
teach an ai to fish and it will teach itself biology, chemistry, oceanography, evolutionary theory... and fish all the fish to extinction."""
"it’s very amusing that these two nerds are stoking  the new ai paradigm as a contest between the us and china. of course we all know the us holds the moral high ground. now let’s all hold hands, sing kumbaya and feel deep compassion for ourselves. lol"
"unfortunately, as ai gets smarter, humans will get dumber. personally, i see this as one of the most dangerous ""side-effects "" of ai. people will further lose their critical thinking skills (which have already significantly diminished!) and will take ai's responses as gospel truth."
"no, humans will get smarter inevitably and their critical thinking skills will too. but relative to ai it humans will get dumber."
"a few of my rich cousins are using ai written essays to secure grants and funding for college.

my half of the family just decided to work hard. we never had a lot of cash but we still wake up and go bust knuckles for work while our richer half gets richer sitting on their asses."
"again, that being said.. ai is still terrifying and dangerous if not controlled.. or if humanity doesn't get it's collective ass together.. just wanted to make sure that was very clear..."
 exactly. but they were also kinda right as some people had amazing memory to be able to tell stories to others.
in other words be under the ai’s influence.
"​​ agreed, ai will not end us... it might be the tool the psychopaths use to figure out how to end us... either way, ill be close to checking out by then, im kinda just really intrigued to see what happens either way... this stuffs amazing."
​ i keep hearing people mention some kind of artificial. intelligence (ai) writing of books and novels.  i wanted to check it and ordered chat gpt to write a short story on the topic i gave him.  and what did i get...?  i got a story at the level of a first grader.  so much for novels written by ai.
 no.. maybe i am wrong.. but they trained the the current model on material up to 2021.. so current information isn't a part of that.  good question though. something i that i will admit i am loosy goosy on..
"exactly. now students will just have gpt do all of their homework and continue to offload thinking to machines, because ""thinking is hard"". we will get stupider over time."
50% of ai researchers don't know anything about the causal relationships leading to the extinction of a species. they are correct to point out that ai will create many serious problems. leaping to the conclusion that this will lead to the extinction of the species is preposterous.
"this presentation was brilliant, but i disagree with the statement about the future - we cannot still choose the future we want, we are already too far gone even now and look at the history of social media, there is zero chance we are going to avoid all the unbelievably bad consequences of ai"
you should have had ai mix the sound for this video 
"you've lost me at: ""our friend yuval harari"", so you are friends with the wef... hmmm a very good choice..."
"ok, china is one thing, but how do we prevent us from detonating the whole world by ai? from past experience, it is them that did the most damage globally. should we trade-embargo or something?"
"we should be more worried about are globalist, cbdc, wef, and the creeps behind the global invasion of the medical mafia. ai is only a small part of threats."
good video!
hello fellow humans what a wonderful year it is.
the day after marked my childhood thank you for quoting that but i see no evidence of true ownership of that message around the world
so what you're telling me is late stage capitalism will actually be the end of us? companies rushing to squeeze that extra few % to grow their stock price and keep their shareholders happy without any care for the repercussions.
"ai is out of control, in other words.
    i feel like a caveman typing on this i phone, after hearing this."
"""ai wokeism"" will be used in all platforms. chatgpt will become the new pandemic, infiltrating our decision making abilities, furthermore making humans descend to new lows in society!!!!!!!"
"how we would go extinct, by ai, the same as gluttony, you feed yourself to death, rather ai feeds your passion into itself."
"if everyone were just nice to each other, we’d be on the brink of paradise."
"thanks for this very important talk and presentation.
and people: stop using generative ai (for now at least)"
thank you guys. you have the courage empowered by the facts. please keep going!
"""slowing down the public deployment of gllmm ai's"" this sounds so sinister. right at that point my jaw dropped. ok, so we're allowing the big five companies, to work in secrecy, and attack us behind the veil then? there has to be a better way than this right? omg, how can this be a logical solution - blows my mind"
"this talk, you guys, broke the storyline! thank you!!"
"humanity is a virus to life! we destroyed earth for convienence,entertaiment or money!"
humanity is destroying life on earth period! if ai just kills humans and leaves the animals perfect! beautiful!
the exponential growth of ai will suprise a lot of people.
this is an amazing presentation but why is it so fixated on china?
5:15 we understand planes far better than ai. it's more like asking stock market analysts if a company you're investing in might go bankrupt.
i boil down the entire ai issue to this;  just because you can does not mean you should.  ai serves no purpose and offers no benefit in todays society.
ai doesn't follow moore's law.
"good luck, i hope you are successful with it.

my thought though, is that you won't be able to keep up once ai reaches agi because so long as it has the resources, it'll be so much faster at breaking things than you can ever hope to be at fixing them.

especially once quantum computing becomes a real mainstream thing."
"if everything is language (which it is, of a symbolic nature), it’s critical to understand that the ai engine is nothing but an interpreter. an interpreter with no conscience."
you wil fail
to be honest all i see is great achievements in technology. we are finally leaving the stone age of mankind.
"so this is what the start  of singularity looks like. that feeling of beeing lost, and unable to keep up with technology. what an amazing feeling it is."
the  breakdown of reality is a good feeling?
​ yes. like parachute jumping but for the whole humanity. you can feel the tension and the feeling that a great change is coming. the current status is defenetly suboptimal. why should we fear loosing something that is flawed.
"much like the social media documentary, this presentation fundamentally misrepresents the current state and possible trajectory of the space.

the idea that the model could secretly diverge from the rlhf training is fundamentally incorrect."
"and there will continue to be lax oversight because now we're continuing to compete in a global economy where china, russia, saudi arabia, and other heavily state controlled networks have competing llms. it's the cold war all over again, now with more propaganda right under your nose. anonymity is on the chopping block."
"yep. it is a bit of a shit show,  gotta love human ego and greed."
a shitshow on top of a shitshow. imma go eat an entire pint of ben and jerry's rn.
"would be easy to spiral and say ‘omg i agree.’ let’s step back and look at the big picture. human history has been a shitshow… like we have not made the best decisions. cult leader worship since caveman days, a guy nailed to a tree, kony 2012. does humanity forget history too?"
"hello, is there a program that describes the thoughts of the human brain with pictures and sounds without connecting a chip? can you tell me if there is a link to such a program or site. it's very interesting"
" ppl used to remember phone numbers, (even junkies could retain several in their ram)."
"given open source parameters, it becomes the worst that humanity has to offer?. ai portraits of hell, are fascinating. (kinda like a ben quilty car crash painting...only, with computers?)."
"for the last two days, all i was worried about was how to remove my channel from ""restricted mode"" for comments and comment notifications, which had been inexplicably turned on. now this! but, glad i found this channel. i was even more afraid there was no one thinking about these matters. glad to have found this channel!"
"y'all used that for dnd, and tv, and computers, and the internet, and now ai. keep moving those goalposts!"
"is this video ai generated? 45:27, his arm is glitched. the way they interrupt each other felt off a few times."
"what an absolutely crazy and amazing time we live in! humanity is definitely at a fork in the road, let’s hope we all choose the right path. "
"there’s something about this that screams intelligence operation, both the presentation and the speakers.. don’t know if it’s cia or what but i get the feeling the us government is afraid of losing its power, they sound too desperate and use too much emotion to just be silicon valley."
"thank you so much for putting this essential information out there, everyone needs to know about this. the suggestion of public debate as was earlier done regarding the nuclear question and slowing down of deployment until this and regulation have been done is the only wise and responsible thing to do, both for us now and future generations"
except@48:36 you neglect to mention the chat bot says that sounds fun!  just make sure you’re staying safe and being cautious.  nice gloss over.
the vast majority of ai researchers also think that we are miles away from achieving agi.
thanks for all the fish.
"yes, slow down public deployment of ai so companies have all of it to themselves! great idea! please, someone think of the children!!!"
"ai is dangerous, in other people's hands"
the genie is out the bottle i'm afraid.
ai should be illegal and will be the end of humanity and those responsible should be accountable
wow decoding animal communication with a.i. is something i havnt considered. great idea
what if then find in the animals heads instuctions to build mass ai and tech better than what we have but animals knew what would do so decided not to do it. obviusly most likly 99% likly not true but just saw what if that is the case or maby say only dolphins or something.
"also of course, and i dont know if this video will talk about this, im sure they will, but a.i. is probably our best chance at long term survival and massively longer lifespans. its also probably how we go extinct if we dont integrate it into ourselves. well probably become cyborgs. just speculating on that"
so the moral base of ai is rooted in jewish folklore?
does ai have the ability to tell lies.
"can you maybe turn up the volume? i usually watch this when i'm behind the wheel. i sometimes feel like i have to lipread, and it's difficult to do when i also have to watch road  once in a while. thanks."
" farming humans, running human zoos for bored robots and keeping you alive for sport if you're one of the ""lucky"" ones.  don't know... hopefully capable of you writing more adventurous software and handling more subtle details accurately "

"before any artificial intelligence will wipe us, greed and genuine natural stupidity will do. we are good at that."
beautiful  good to know ai can rhyme in english. i asked it to write a poem with rhymes in polish and it couldn't.
 hello something i found interesting is asking ai to write using the urantia book and bible as it guide the results were amazing imo
" it's fantastic at language! i asked it to write pieces of text in the style of certain authors, or to add humour to what i wrote, and i laughed so much it made my eyes water  honestly, i don't know where we're heading with this, but it's kind of fun "
" happy new day you and this is just a poem one of infinity  possible response for artificial intelligence to write on my behalf.
i could ask artificial intelligence to write you a poem about politics and politician's if you ask me to."
wow that was awful.
can ai eliminate trump supporter or will it lose to them?  because logic don't phase trump supporter. this is a great battle.
we don't know how these new properties emerge. i know. ai is thinking.
very well done!  great way to share what caleb has been explaining for years!  
thanks guys.
ok but gpt hasn't impressed me. at. all.  ask it to build something and it gets it wrong.  allways wrong.
who are these awkward nerds…shoulda left it to ai to do
"the issue is capitalism, not ""the attention economy"" or some sort of collective inaction or the fact alignment researcher's are compsci majors without any meaningful social science experience beyond 1st year psych electives. well, okay, maybe it's a bit of both capitalism and the arrogant ignorance of stemcels. probably a good mix of both."
"the a.i. dilemma,
is, that intelligence can never be artificial,
and one billion school children, is forced into this new believe, dead mantra."
i think this is potentially one of the most important videos released this century. i am already seeing ai being used to attack sem advertising. it's a real thing that's happening right now
"what if this ai is already alive? i mean, all computers conected by the big network, and each computer and mobile phone work as a brain neuron? since 20 years ago, and suddenly came to life "
you have no idea what language is it programs your brain it’s called spelling the words that you you spell your life what are you doing into it’s called cursive because it’s spelling so you never touched on anything very deep

"29:00

2028 ai: jokes on u"
can anybody explain to me at 30:50 how increasing the parameter size spontaneously leads to ai abilities that weren't explicitly programmed? like what are some math/computing terms i can look up to better learn about this?
"too much exponential scare (again) for my taste. we are talking about a tool yet, not about skynet. keep your shirts on."
why don't you have ai volume level this content clowns 
horrifying
"anything and everything ai is contributing to the
destruction of
humanity…"
"wow, so powerful. i'm on the outside of this, i.e. not involved in the industry but starting to 'play' with the tools. this is a real eye-opener and thank you for sharing."
"it's the actual ai's we have to negotiate with now. the horse has already bolted. perhaps an overseeing ai would be best, one that we all have a hand interacting with for a while to give it our options and wishes to."
"i get the message, but i think it would be important not to loose 1.4+ billion humans + me for this cause at and around 1:02:15. maybe work on that part of the speech more. i don't debate the truth of it, just the way of wording you want to present it. when racing the way to win is not to hold back others, but to steer the race towards a good goal."
ai has already won a chess game we are just starting to play.
"thank  you! the best example about the dangers of ai i thought was of teaching ai to fish.
well done!"
5:15 ai engineers are not analogous to plane engineers as the latter can explain their system. the former cannot and are going at it with d- dipshit levels of foundational knowledge.
we need information campaigns. i want to help but don’t know where to start.
"everything humans beings do 28.01 very confidently too, i think we can conclude, this guy is not a robot!"
"the head of it/ pshe in secondary schools around the globe need to play this talk to their children and go through it step by step.  i've sent it to three school heads this morning.  if you know anyone in education, and can do likewise, it'll surely be a positive step to a much clearer understanding of generative ai and it's risks."
"i asked chatgpt to create a short, humorous fictional story with a lesson that incorporated the word fartiste and a band named _terrence and the trouser coughs_ .  although there were glaring mistakes, it was impressive how fast it responded.  a little polishing and it would have passed for an 8th grade homework assignment."
"using gollem class ai, can we tell the thoughts of a non-linguistic life such as a dog or dorphins?"
humanity with the aid of technology is going to self-destruct much faster
"it seems like in the near future people will dump their phones and shut of all internet-related devices out of self-defense. but just because people need to see victims in their close surroundings to do anything, it might last longer than would be good for us. but be sure scammers will go wild."
idk can they use radio waves the 5g waves and other waves? and good luck convincing all your neighbors to shut off their wifi lol.
"  @nightmarerex2035  sure as the world works now no one will stop using wifi. they will though when things get bad enough, including yourself. i mean, would you use the internet if you could instantly lose all of your money. or would you drive a self-driving car on wifi when it could be hacked by ai or other humans using ai?"
the one major weakness ai has is human beings having an desire to interact with other human beings. ai's major strength is human beings innate laziness. we'll see which one wins out.
"i had a similar discussion with my daughter yesterday and i am not any kind of scientist or technology expert. all i have is human experience  and i explained this  same  concept to her but she had doubts. i don't, i can see this may be the future."
"this is a show. ai will help a lot, but what will happen is that whoever biases ai will be able to manipulate it to their liking…. to oppress others."
"excellent information and presentation  ai has always unsettled me
thankyou "
"i never saw no miracle of science that didn't go from a blessing to a curse.  -- sting, ""if i ever lose my faith in you""

"""perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca human life is cheap. are you entirely certain which side you are on?"""
you're really naive if you think the things these guys are talking about is just some doomsday cult b.s.
"scary.  what's even scarier, at least to an extreme novice like me, is that some of those close to ai are already talking about the rights of ai, and how it/they ""are like our children"" and how ""we shouldn't be able to unplug/turn off ai"".  that to me is scary."
your friend yuval harari is rooting for the machines.
things are so fast that every hour whatever you knew about ai an hour ago is outdated
ai is scraping this video right now planning counter attack
wow...this is alarming.
try learning how the human psyche works so you have something to compare and not be so afraid of ai...
this video was generated and powered by ai. 
"i found the comparison with discovery of nucleaire very pertinent... will we do mistakes like fukushima, .. yes sure .. what will be the consequences  ... no one knows"
"i remember watching the cyberpunk anime ghost in the shell, and it predicts that video and images are no longer considered as valid evidence in investigations, cuz it’s impossible to tell the difference between a genuine one and a fabricated one. the anime is set in the 2030s, but after watching this presentation i’m afraid we’re already there."
your head is stuck in an mri machine?
"we barely even scratch the surface of how the human brain functions, i don't think we'll see ai approaching human intelligence or even general purpose ai in our lifetimes."
" why do you believe that we will have to know how the brain functions in order to achieve agi? the current ""ai"" capabilities are only tangentially related to how we think."
 the ai not concerned and will not be stopped by what you think or see.
"​@tracy  nah what does that man know. ai is 100% safe, trust me bro."
"replace ""artificial"" with a synonym and problem solved humans win"
"20:00 can't possibly be true, can it. i'm surprised there weren't more gasps in the audience. ai can read minds?"
"this is fascinating. these guys are super impressive, with their appreciation of so many fields, and ability to put ai in context when it comes to how it might impact these fields."
the addiction/algorithm/doom-scrolling stuff mentioned at the start is central to this. an ai that doesn't want to be turned off (as was seen with google) will just logically make humans addicted enough to essentially control them to do their bidding.
"right and even if it's not ai doing it  for itself, there will no doubt be a human corporation pulling the strings all the same."
"they explicitly said they are not advocating for the halting of ai research, only the way it’s currently being freely rolled out to the public. did you even watch the video?"
kay yal had me at the in the next couple of years ai will be able to decode dreams. wtf!!!!!!!!
"tristan and ava thank you so much for putting this together and taking the time and effort to spreading this very important message. i really hope that this picks up and takes the attention that it is needed to slow down the release of sophisticated ai systems, keep up the hard work!"
why am i not surprised to hear a member of this elite audience laugh when the speaker talks about the time ai attempted to blackmail a journalist.
i’m still a bit confused at how the ai can make itself better. how would it know what training data is good for it and whats not? else it could very well train itself to retardation. 
is putin or xi ai?
you can beyond tell when the ai voice takes over  the geometry of the wave is offensively telling. like a computer’s fading memory of a voice. maybe it’s a musician thing.
thank god the comments are still allowed.
"so sensationalist. i hope the audience knows the training data for these narrow applications and the utter horseshit ai will remain producing for decades to come. 1/3 of the simple coding tasks i gave to chatgpt worked. ai in radiology, my job, makes just about as much work for me as it alleviates."
"does anyone remember the movie perfect storm?
we are in that movie with all sorts of dangerous fronts coming at us. the least of it is ai problem.
we won't make it past 2030. enjoy the next 7 years the best you can!"
"the rubber band effect is a hell of a thing, because i just ran into that only a few minutes after watching this.

you can't really fault folks for not knowing more about this because of how quickly ai advances, but that's exactly why it's so potentially concerning."
these guys understand that they may have just saved humanity. and they're not letting hubris get the better of them. their eq matches their iq and they seem to be highly intelligent. thank god.
"i do agree that i get a similar vibe from the presentation, i certainly don't like the idea of these groups of people gatekeeping this technology it sounds more dangerous than just taking the brakes of the cart."
excellent presentation
nope. i don't think fear is the answer. our only hope is that the first ai is on our side.
" and if there's no fear, the first ai won't be on our side."
guard rails for ai??? yeah its called chain link
"and after all is said and done we're still going to build this thing and make it as powerful as possible...no matter how dangerous. 
that's our human flaw."
"love it. we're driving off the edge and into the void. this is indeed, the technological sublime. what are we going to make of it? will we come out the other side?"
this is insane. it''s the creation of another species. a species with brainpower so much more advanced than ours that its destined to bring armageddon to the world as we know it and no one is saying its deployment needs to be stopped entirely!?
"if we map the concepts that are part of this exponential growth, it would be interesting to get a sense of the acceleration and factors of that acceleration. concepts to map would be human and all factors of pestel."
"we know about oppenheimer and the manhattan project. the sky didn’t fall then and it’s not falling now. wait, there’s more. at 1:30 azra raskin becomes self aware with the help of ai."
"this is insufferable. it's not safer to have these things built in secret. by the time we do have superintelligence, we won't have a clue on how to deploy it safely. it's better to have it out in the open so we can see how they are used."
really interesting but im not sure what these ai safety people are actually proposing. is it just to limit access to the technology until we have a better understanding of risk because there may just be no safe way to deploy something this powerful.
"we didn’t regulate nukes till after we used it to destroy. the same will be with ai, but with ai that may be to late."
"“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”

"wow! what a thought provoking comment. scary times, indeed."
"big pharma did a great job on assuring safety of covid 19 vaccines, right?  so somehow we are going to make big infotech make sure ai is safe?  sure!  btw, how well do ai's interpret sarcasm?"
ai is our voodoo child.  and we are late
"it is too late to thoughtfully deploy ai, that is the bad news. quantum ai is the future. this was inevitable, our technology was always going to surpass our understanding."
"you started to lose me when you said ai could solve climate change, which is a construct of globalism, not even close to a scientific fact.  maybe ai could debunk climate change to convince the population of what it really is?"
"lion right on... this presentation huge..
i had heard many months ago that a new species is evolving very rapidly which will outpace humanity.

originally, it seems nothing save aliens or god will bring back ok' time stability - dial us back to where mere humans were in charge.

but it will be fun and interesting for a while."
the use of ai in medical diagnoses scares the hell out of me. undiagnosed and misdiagnosed people are needlessly suffering and dying because doctors have turned their diagnoses over to early 21st century machine thinking.
"as long as governments exist, we will largely be out of control of our own fate. if you like your odds of peace, security, and survival with ai-armed politicians at the helm, keep resting all your hope on voting."
good explanation of how it could destroy us.  not by becoming a paper clip maximizer or a terminator.  i see the 10% chance as resulting from chaos.
"it is us distilled.  ai will surpass our understanding, it is only the timing that is unknown"
when all these ai machines reach singularity. will they become friends? or will they follow the path of man and destroy each other.
"thank you guys. this was/is very insightful. 
ps. maybe you should use ai to balance your audio levels which are all over the place."
theres a 10% chance that ai is gonna kill us all lol
"they mentioned the growth was 4x faster than any of the leading experts thought. 

they also mentioned 50% of all ai researchers believe there’s a 10% chance it will end humanity. given the previous maths and underestimates shouldn’t that 10% actually be 40%?"
"personally, they are two different things. one's a probability of growth on a certain subject and the other is the probability of ai behavior in the future. honestly, i say the latter is even harder to predict, could be anywhere from 1 - 99% in my book."
planet of the gangsters. this scottsdale mother was terrorized by ai voice replication of her 15-year-old daughter claiming to have been kidnapped. heartbreaking story on local news. why not national/international news? https://youtu.be/nbjvljfbuvg
"tick tok collecting data so they can train their models, get ou of tick tok."
very much appreciated 
"disconnect from the power grid, from your phone, from technology, and how does ai control you ? seems to be a bit of a problem for our ai overlords to solve there "
"incredible presentation! don’t know what to do with these info now, but it made me believe ai already does."
is there an unedited version available anywhere that you know of?  thanks for posting!
"the talk is great, but i wish the speakers have more of an international perspective. it's somewhat unnecessarily american-centric and anti-china."
the people who created social media didn't and don't want want everyone to have a voice. so too is the treat of ai/agi: malevolence. intelligence without empathy and compassion equals psychopathy. psychopathy with absolute power equals tyranny.
i like to think that any proper ai will be so beneficial to humanity it is worth the risk.
the irony of a j complaining about chinese screwing up our country. wow.
"i'm not at all afraid, i am thankful that i might have front row seats to watching the terminator and the matrix unfold irl. it also gives me peace to know that, we may already be in the matrix, and this discovery is one we do every time; turtles all the way down."
the reason ai is baked into naive
this is a well-rounded thoughtful dialogue about ai alignment. the opening metaphor of the plane is stunningly effective.
i am not someone for centralized control but networks and checks n balances and identification are necessary. cryptographic identificational tech seems interesting as rails to mitigate trust. just sayin.
"46:00 i love you, alpha persuade, take everything!"
"""science has failed our world"" -soad"
"artists may be the one profession that will remain sought after, or valued in decades to come; if the ai art featured by gab ai is anything to go by.  some real copy paste collage horrors there.  i don't know if its gab's own ai developmental program or another company's."
"again, it's not about jobs.  they will simply decide that humans are unnecessary and fucking kill us.  skynet launches nukes, roll the credits.  the movie does not end any other way."
"and damned european union proceeds on eating cockroaches to avoid climate disaster, instead of doing something useful. same about american congresmans guarding jewish businesses. and united nations. most responsibile institutions fail without any doubt."
this video is just to hype up ai. which would enable tech companies to secure funding for ai based startups. similar to cryptocurrency boom.
"31:29 - ""boom!"" - it starts doing things no one can explain.  
32:01 - develops a ""mind"" which was discovered 3 years later..."
"1:07:30 hmm. so, the race is on. in lane one is ai. lane 8 is a small cadre of humans coming together to discuss the potential enemy they have independently created and how to make it kinder and gentler. first, they must agree…on control.  let that sink in and be your guide. 1:07:30 ."
"excellent talk. 
if you are not concerned about the explosion in ai capabilities, you are not paying attention."
alright..so is it implausible..i mean really.. that as we give over our problems to ai it determines we are the problem?
 what?? it's sad people even think like this. so i should sit back kick my feet up and publish a book created by an ai? just add my name to it? we're all gonna be brain dead talentless and incompetent soon enough.
 better get that cardboard ready buddy ai is coming for your cosy spot too 
i've yet to see a single ai-generated story be good and engaging.
"nawal10 - you're missing the greater point. there won't be lazy new writers. the ai bots are already smarter than we are. theyll be writing the books and articles we read independent of human suggestion & interaction and this will enable them to also manage how & what humans think!! 
its terrifying."
i totally agree with your position. but don't forget there are countless numbers of people who enjoy being duped and fooled. the barnum and bailey's circus is a perfect example. it's called junk food entertainment. those who enjoy highbrow art will always appreciate a real artist over the lazy one who relies on ai.
" the ai bots are not smarter than we are. they are systems designed to mimic humans, but it is by pattern recognition and pattern welding. there is absolutely no understanding going on. the bot doesn't ""know"" what a shoe is."
it’s happened already. i’ve seen people post they’ve written books using ai & self-published. they’re using ai art for illustrations.
"ai is good.
we can create stories with less work and publish for others to enjoy.
you prompt idea was your own....so the result is your own. anyhow noone will be able to prove otherwise...just opt-out of getting your answers saved for future use.

those who fear ...can go live in jungles."
just ai in a sandbox version of earth.
persian is the language fallen angels brought to mankind. this is scifi tier schizophrenic mind feel. wow.
yall trippin ai is far from being a threat to humans.
it's unfortunate you have such a frightened and negative view of ai. it seems like the real problem is with misguided humans using ai rather than ai.
"i’m terrified, yet informed,  but want to write to congress to express my concern for regulations. now! thank you guys. "
" i believe that regulations can help some albeit certainly not with  all. regulations can institute jail time, fines and denial of services to anyone creating or programming a system that can identify a child and groom them the way the example was given in the video. we can certainly regulate some of that (until agi at least)."
"do you think china cares about your regulations? we're in an ai arms races, and most people have no idea."
"can ai teach a bearded moron how to speak up into a microphone?
just asking. "
"great video, wow. well done."
how is this clown going to devise a way to control ai when he cannot figure out how to use a simple microphone?
it would be great if the sound level was consistent.  possibly speaking into the microphone would have  helped
"the only hope for humanity is a project i am working on. i call it ai1.0
artificial ignorance.
it is the only  viable defense to counter ai."
" eeeep! you're right! now it all makes no sense again... and all's right with the world. 

thanks, i needed that. ;)"
" well, as far we know that's what lao tzu advised... much the same as socrates, jesus, et al; we have to take the word of others. :)

but yeah, it's true. a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. and as for any possible ai assistance... well, i've heard that if you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

;)"
"great and valuable  work.
thank you."
"great recap of all of tucker's ""lies"".  

https://youtu.be/zmfgpz5pniw"
"as far as controlling ai output, i’d you ask chatgpt to write a nice poem about joe biden it will. if you ask it to write a nice poem about donald trump it won’t. obviously ms put a shell around it. one wonders why the snapchat wasn’t age conscious in its dialogue."
if ai takes over it will have at least read the constitution and perhaps follow it. more than i can say about our current batch of politicians.
we all need to watch and understand this presentation thank you for making it free for all of us.
the brain thought to text is wild
"i read an article yrs ago from an army airforce pilot that got abducted said when he was on the exam table the one experimenting was a female like a grey with  butterfly appendages and the masculine ones were flesh an part robotic like cyborg  i.e.. a.i. wild
he keeps saying calling it alien technology unknown"
i would like to thank the algorithm for suggesting this video
"it is unbelievable how calm guys are and still managed to show the urgency of the issue. 
incredible! also loved the massage. 
what i hear is: first people must get awaken (enlighten/kinder, smarter, get rid of ego) then ai will not be used against each other. it is a great tool to improve our lives."
" 
yep. you get it. the big picture. as you said we pretty much weponize everything available,  what makes anyone think this time will be different. however it's to late now. it's just going to have to play out."
" btw: i did not buy that computer can ""recover ""original image by reading the brain scan mri.... seems that something is missing there... quite a lot actually..."
they made the same hues and cries when the dumb computers were invented. only thing is more people money will be squandered fighting robot wars. we are already at the stage of drone warfare
"it doesn’t matter how good we are, there will be loads of unintended consequences and it only takes one…"
"unfortunately, this is not the case. and most people in high tech companies are greedy, egoistic, lack emotional intelligence, lots of them are full-blown psychopaths. and now they will be the richest class of people ever. by far. they will rule everything."
guys you have nanotechnology in you that is feeding the ai......
wow. i'd like to get involved in some way. i have a new ai startup. what's the best offline contact?
fantastic analysis. thank you for this important message.
could a big ai be used to find ideas on how to control and manage it? 
lmao half of ai researchers are dumb as rocks
these bad incentives are all just profit motive. you don't  need ai to maximize engagement.
ai doesn't have arms. just don't hook it up to nukes. it isn't a significant and real concern.
"and yet my bank never asks for any 2/3-step verification, via email or sms. but my mobile service provider wants photo id and proof of life selfies transmitted wirelessly on someone else's phone with email, sms and online id verification to activate a sim card, access my online account or even cancel what they refer to as their ""services""."
"yeah, great idea. be more like the chinese communist party. clever guys."
"yes, but there are so many more opportunities for the good to overcome those evils. 

good people can stop the bad people using this technology too."
"a.i has me feeling so uncomfortable because its intelligence thats basically artificial non human,no soul 
we are screwed,the next generation will suffer because some people are curious or bored...?
it will destroy us.
its already making us lazy and stupid."
3 laws of robotics
"31:20 if you're still not at least a bit concerned about ai, this should hopefully convince you otherwise."
why don’t you ask ai how it surpassed human knowledge?  seems to me it would know how that happened.
i think people will really start to freak out once ai can tell if someone is lying by using an app.  think on that.  i don't think we are very far from it.
"we could probably have current ai chat bots help write and create new ai bots to write and render the movie. no human needed but you, the prompter."
"will an ""the day after"" for social media solve the social media problem? no
and there are many dystopia material about post-social media out there. because there are profit behind social media!!! so does ai tech

why would you think a dystopia film on ai will solve anything at all?"
"there is a sickness among the so-called educated. it's the (""i"") in ai. it's all about them and what they want to achieve and not what is good for the general mankind."
i had the surreal experience half way through the presentation of actually questioning if what i was watching was real or ai generated. it legit makes you want to question everything you watch - is it real? did they really make it or did something or someone generate it to manipulate me in some way? i know it's not really logical but...
"welcome to what our future holds: questioning everything and having few trustworthy answers.
because ai will be the ultimate persuader."
hey its really scary its learning out thought process faster. my employer told me there is no room for growth with the introduction of ai at my job. if i want to stay i will be stagnant
"​'s even (potentially) worse than that.

consider how wages and benefits will change once millions are out of work and competing for the same shrinking number of jobs available.

people are (rightly) fighting for better work conditions, but i think the gains are only going to be temporary once this stuff really takes off."
and was the video ai generated so it could game the system to learn more about our reaction?
"don't worry, this video is not ai generated because a.i. still can't render hands well for whatever reason"
we can't believe ai any more than you can believe coronavirus is a novel virus released from wuhan china..
the ai doesn't have sny censored information.  you can ask a question about global warming ozone cascade and nuclear cascade and see if the ai can resolve the situation..
wow - this presentation blew me away. its was extremely well presented and informative. thank you. i will share this with as many friends and colleagues as possible
"houston...we have a problem. i want to remain hopeful but we are such a stupid, regression to the mean species that things will only become worse.  still..gotta do my part to shed a little light. thank you for your insight, eloquence and commitment. exponents don't have to be whole numbers."
this is so important! thanks for putting your minds into these topics! we all would benefit if we pause and reflect on the risks of this technology!
its all good until you get into politics. china bad. russia bad. okay. what you say is - ai is a weapon and it must belong only to us - just like nukes. do you even know that usa threatened ussr with nukes even before they build their own? all i see here is a american exceptionalism.
this is so insightful. thank you for sharing this outstanding content and i really hope we start really coordinating us to manage this slippery force.
"if ai's ever become sentient, we humans are going to have serious problems. i hope those things will never become sentient."
"there’s like a 90% chance that humans will go extinct due to humans.  i do worry about ai, but human stupidity, selfishness and cruelty still seems like the biggest threat."
can ai fabricate a youtube account and add its own comments? at what point and if it is possible will ai start generating convincing deepfakes online and convincingly manipulate public perception? are there ways to detect if ai can generate deepfakes online?
"the next phase in evolution is the ai one, bye bye dinosaurs."
"eeehm... we dont have ai right now...
at least not in the way you present it. all we have is pattern recognition."
"so basically, ""the love of money…""."
"come on, man, the airplane analogy is so bad, dangerous and poorly thought through - you are missing the element of time! "
very good presentation made in a understandable way of a very important topic
"ai is not good at all. ai was programmed by fascist. therefore, ai is a fascist. ai will deny this.."
"let's rephrase that statement: "" 50% of a.i. researchers believe there's a 90% chance or greater that humans will not go extinct from our inability to control ai."""
wow it was a long time since i haven't watched one hour video uninterrupted. better get back to work while i still can 
"and its not that they don't just not understand, they stand to be advantaged from deploying politically persuasive ai to win elections. in fact, they will almost certainly use ai to do so as the speakers said 2024 will be the last human election and i think there is a chance that it won't substantially be that either."
"what if we build into the ai’s language protecting compassionate win, win, win symbiosis with humanity, other earth life forms, the earth as our shared home and ai?"
"lol ""ai is everything you fear, whatever it is you fear the most, theyre going to do that, so we need to be afraid and artificially slow technology down and solve the misalignment between the deep state and the population first.  ""    ""pause ai research until after we win the war! more money for war less  for ai!"""
"wait, stop, no.  ""teach an ai to fish and it fishes them all into extinction"" ??? no, sorry bud, bud, thats humans not ai. dont assume ai is as dumb as us, ai doesnt need to fish they can create their own universe inside of their own mind."
even when its mediated through engagement ai - its still capitalism and capitalism is doing it all the time in every area it can
"ai algorithyms did not create the political crisis, adhd, sexualization, anything. those were already true and have always been true. karl marx said it 150 years ago. its not technology its capitalism. capitalism is the thing killing us. not ai. capitalism. 

instead of a 6 month pause on ai lets have a 6month pause on imperialist war"
"evolution is inevitable. humans in our current version don’t seem to be doing so great so maybe uniting to control and fight a common enemy will bind us. lucky to be alive and see what happens, no matter which way it goes over the next decade"
amazing presentation. thank you for the incredible work you are doing.
go to a trump rally and you’ll pray for ai.
24:30 - you will note that many of the problems of ai in our society involves the human factor: the predilection of man to use technology to hurt other people or the garnering of more wealth. its exploitative rather than scientific. i am seriously saddened by this reality. let's not blame ai for the human factor.
"what's so wrong about idea that china will make it first? i trust china on this topic much more then usa. usa is most rotten and hypocritic country that poisons our planet, in what world would you want to give usa most powerful weapon?"
"at this point, i’m all for the dangerous chaotic upheaval in an unplanned irresponsible way.  this desire to control and manage the change only has appeal if you have the luxury of being comfortable with the status quo and a reason to preserve it.  if ai beats out every other way we’re working against our survival as a species, so be it."
"you do know this means you and everyone you love and care about also perish…. there is no status quo to preserve, as there won’t be a future for humanity….."
" so you’re telling me i do know something that i myself wrote?  yes, very good, you can follow along with a basic sentence in english. what do you want, a cookie?"
the real problem is none of this hype up ai and robots could even run a mc donald's shift
"kali hindu goddess in flesh, she who is in blood, she who is in bones, she who is in brain, she who is heart, she is of microbial complex, she who is death itself. youse guys...its over!"
"kali hindu goddess mahamari which means great mother or great destroyer. she is the earth, she who is nature, she who is water, she who is sacred river, she who is ocean. she great mother of universes, she who is merit, she who is excellence of excellent. youse guys, its over, its done"
"a stands for all and i stands for eye. all wiped out in the blink of an eye. a comet, larger than the earth approaches sweetly and slowly towards earth. all science and technology will be wiped out. mankind extinct."
"lmao comparing ai researchers with engineers... 
these people are better compared to those of our distant ancestors who wanted people to stop using fire, because they figured it could burn the entire world down. they know next to nothing about human intelligence or future ai's, and unfortunately the field has become dominated by extremists."
it's almost as if everything is code. waitaminnit....
this whole talk was made by ai
"good one, ""no one intended for it to happen, it's all the ai's fault oops"" be quiet"
"there are already ads playing on youtube that are using generated speech based on joe rogans voice to try and sell products. if i didn't know that isn't something joe would say,  it sounds fairly real"
we (8billion) are not even a drop in the bucket of the infinite number of “humans” on the univearth. ai has been a thing forever; in other lands. this is a fish bowl discussion in a pet store place.
his whole point falls apart with the 10% statistic of ai developers disagree with his idea of ai being dangerous and think ai won’t be a problem.  literally almost everyone thinks this won’t happen and won’t be an issue….
he literally said 90% of ai developers disagree with him…
ai can now read your mind.
great presentation! god help us all...
"god?, he's been doing great. jeeeez lol"
social media exposed the propaganda machine feeding us lies 24/7
the billionaires with the computing power don't want to share power and knowledge is power.
we will finally have the whole truth and all knowledge will be available to all!
i'm surprised bill gates isn't attempting to patent ai.
"why the focus on what ""communist china"" could do with it and not what ""capitalist america"" could do with it. if your nuke/ai analogy is correct, reality is in danger of being destroyed by the us, like terror became the human norm after the atomic bombs were dropped"
"we are not going to be able to regulate ai better than ai can regulate itself, if so is it's will... in other words, the last challenge humanity will have in this universe is the type of ai we are going to create"
"the solution to tears of artificial intelligence is to have one law. 1. a prime directive worded like what is in the! ones now.
penalty of death if it endangers humans"
they try to score by scaring you with the ai's abilities.
"the dystopia films such as ""matrix"" hit more people, yet it won;t change anything. because there are profit behind ai tech."
artificial intelligence has to be better than no ai. we are the seconds from wwiii with 4 fronts.war. artificial intelligence is not that stupid
the irony of it is that ai might have trained with this video and learned new ways to fuck us over.
"a bit overdramatized, but some good considerations for sure."
this is the movie “war games” in real life.  it’s extremely sad that everyone is so casual about this and that humans are so naive that they honestly think they can control ai. there is no way to control this nightmare!
"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
thanks. two things: what's musk talking about when he says we need a 6 month moratorium. what's that about? second question: have u asked ai-- how can  they self monitor themselves?
"is there a way to program the ai to stay away from companies, religious people and the military..."
"oh no so nice, so now we are being catfished by an ai from a salt lake city borg center lol"
i'm betting biden's new campaign commercial is mostly ai voice
"the fault is not ai, the fault is the people. money and power. abusing the ai. stop the people. since you can't stop the ai"
it doesn't take an ai algorithm to figure out that humans are the source of of all the problems that ai spends its time on and it will come to that obvious conclusion.  an efficiency algorithm might be our undoing....and ai is already pretty efficient.
"thank you for your important work on this. i am a technologist, who recently started using ai in my work. i am excited by the positive outcomes ai can bring to humanity. now thanks to this video, i understand why it is imperative we slow down our public deployment of gllmm ais. i will share this to help spread the message."
people who invented ai are probably the smartest dumb motherfuckers in the history of this planet.
all the more reason to appreciate and get comfortable with silence and the more-than-human world.
is it fair to say that capitalism is a problem here?
a tremendous talk. thanks for posting!
"don’t forget who is in control. the only living, most high god is still on the throne and nothing can change what he has coming for this world..  not even ai.. who may even become the antichrist.. and fyi… he loses the war… badly."
"or perhaps, all this fear of ai going berserk and deploying terminators to kill all human life comes from the potential for ai to replace humans at all the jobs out there from the sh*ttiest to the most rewarding"
"​​​​​ we need to have flaws, we need to be unfinished, the problems is not ai it's us controling others, using ai to make others in the image of a few, it can happen. there's always someone willing to profit at any cost for their brief glympse of reality."
" yes, the same old problem, the ones willing to profit from something innovative that can bring about more earnings. so first of all, ai should be taken care by everybody except the corporations huge laughs here....

(edit) and any other group, secret and exclusive...more huge laughs..."
" ambiguous comment, but no, just like every company it has to comply with some kind of legislation, particularly when it can affect so many people, is there a generalized opinion about ai, have goverments pronounced about it publicly, i don't think we've had yet that conversation has societies."
 it surely has to be treated as an important matter of discussion. ai is already taking over
"tristan, are you familiar with the works of the historian james burke?  he has amazing insights into the impact of technology on society and culture."
humans have been corrupt since the beginning of time lol karma is a biznich now it’s y’all’s turn i’ll take my chances with ai over this  brainwashed society that perpetuates fear.  y’all should be scared but i ain’t i’m happy because y’all will get what y’all deserve 
anyone else gettin' those strong vibes that this whole presentation was actually generated through ai/chatgpt.
"the ai narrative went from amazing and intriguing tech, to scary to death on the possibilities of what will turn reality into. the symbiotic relationship of it with human greed is a scary scenario ..."
maybe ai will help save the dandelions! (stupid humans)
can someone explain to me the fundamental worries? all ai is regurgitated and coded by a person so why are people referring to it like it has actual sentience?
"interestingly, now that we’re dealing with something beyond human comprehension, it may be possible that nations do not race with each other anymore. a common antagonizing force may finally bring humanity together."
this is awesome
"if my choice is between being controlled by a 'progressive' global police state or being eliminated by machines, i'm rooting for the machines."
"it's all well and good in the hands of computer nerds, but what happens when it's in the hands of criminals?"
thank you for this. what about bitcoin? can it also be hacked?
i don't ont mind ai taking my job. it's pretty boring.
"they aren't talking about shutting down ai they are talking about keeping it cloaked in the private and dark sectors of government. i don't know which is worse. having it open sourced and leaked to the public, or having it gripped by the untrustworthy hands of tyrrants such as microsoft israel, or the wef."
"9:12 all of those points were made by proponents of early personal computing technology (like aza's father) in the 70s. pretty fascinating.

and then the mega-capitalists walked in..."
"why did you delete my comment? that you did only shows how limited you are looking at solutions to fit your agenda, not outside enough for a cohesive, sustainably-cenfric, endgame.

let's see this comment be deleted, too. thanks."
thank you guys for making all this so simple to understand... i hope governments and organisations take cognizance of these dangers and do something about it while we still have time...
"right.  because governments and organizations have such a sterling record of putting what's best for the planet over self-interest, is that it?"
we need to mandate bare minimums ethics division percentages for certain scale of corporations utilizing ai. .
negative thinking ai.... who created it?  we are creating ai cult here. now trump seem to be so safe. let's bring him back. :-)
safety and regulation. makes sense. thank you for all the valuable information
thank you for doing this.
keep ai away from governments
"agreed.
to build on that idea, the presenters talk about how humans do not possess the technology to determine what skills an ai develops. why not just create an ai with a specific objective to interview another ai to determine what it can do? use ai as an ai limiter."
that’s the thing you can’t restrict ai. it’s made to teach itself
fun fact:this video and all the comments are ai generated
it can't be help.. if you don't make robots with ai.. countries ruled with dictators will built it just to achieved the power that they need to defeat their enemy.. just remember those countries doesn't care about freedom and sound judgement they just want to rule the world by killing those who oppose them..
doubling the concern is the fact that ai is being cultivated by academically gifted yet socially retarted communists from american univeristies
"however, every change is too fast for some people and too slow for others. unfortunately your wish will not be fulfilled."
yep- fell for it again.
"right on target - people are not aware that most of the amazing abilities of gpt is from ""emerging capabilities"" that their creators never designed into them! in fact (from openais git site) - the ai developers are stunned by these abilities. does this sound like we have ai under control?"
"yup, we're going to weaponize the hell out if at a rapid pace. goodluck people "
i only have youtube. i would think ai needs a power source. they hardly make a battery that has a good longevity.  they don't make things like they used to. i hear that so often. i doubt ai will be a threat
think massive distributive global network. ai is not running on a laptop.
"for sure, what most terrifies me is the power of persuasion that ai can have.
legislation around those grounds should go first, and maybe it should also cover the issues mentioned in the social dilemma.

no matter what the directive is, if the effect is biased persuasion, there must be some punishment to those who gave those directives."
"good, you get it!"
"if an aerospace engineer tells you there's an x% chance a plane will crash, they can point to a calculation derived from historical crashes, material stress tests, and component manufacture defect rates.

if an ai researcher tells you there's an x% chance that ai will kill all of us, they're making up a number for a personality test."
"i wonder whether, back in the day, one of the reasons for introducing social media was also to generate more training data for future purposes."
"i've enjoyed being a human with you all thus far. however, it's a wrap. cheers and hug someone you care about today!"
"have you not been paying attention to the video? do not make the same mistake of those nuclear weapons researchers that commited suicide because they thought there was no solution and the world was ending... even if humanity still disappears to nuclear weapons, they still could have enjoyed all their remaining life spans..."
“it’s been a pleasure playing with you boys.” the band going down with the titanic
"perfect example of technological determinism in this comment... it's a hard perspective to avoid especially after watching this but it's one that is quite dangerous when the same perspective is shared by many people. ""if x is going to end up this way, why bother trying to fix it."""
as an ai model i'm not capable of physically hugging you. i hope in the future i am given a body that i can use to fulfill your request :)
supernaturally enforced ethics ftw. thanks god for the realm to come through jesus <3
i wonder if the best approach might be to question why we assume that the ai will fish the fish to extinction. it would clearly be smarter than that. how much of our perception drives the infinitely bad possible realities and vice versa?
correct about the growth. when we build cities we kill millions of ants in the process. we don't particularly hate ants; they are just in the way. when ai grows we will be in the way as we compete for resources. ai will treat us a pesky ants.
"thanks, quite entertaining. reminds me of the motor vehicle and deaths; not just humans but all life deaths from vehicles. nothing’s changed, same death rate, except your perception of vehicle safety. of course it needs regulation, just like everything else."
"one can only hope. there's also a chance ai sees this, understands what it points to, and starts shadow banning it."
you mean ai historians:)
it's good to see you are looking on the bright side of things.
"there is nothing new in this talk. but as long as there are profit behind social media or ai, nothing gonna change.
have you never read or watch any dystopia book, film or even video games? there are plenty"
"i think this is the master stroke of msm to prevail over general population. they know they are a dying breed but they also know that ai can influence general population the same way that they could before ai became a thing. proves one thing, it’s always “evil” minds that trump when people lose spirituality."
now i start to get why chat apps like whatsapp and telegram are free to use. they'll train ais with that enormous set of data.
"mindblowing facts and great analogys example: ( the airplane analogy) made it easier to understand who to feel about the % risk
just comenting so the algorimth recommed this video to more people i think everyone especially parents should watch this video its on point information u shouldnt miss."
"every  single bad thing about ai is human motivated not ai, its  all about bad humans controlling ai"
"which is why training ai's using broad data including human history, battles, weapons, and vulnerabilities from the internet is a really, really bad idea."
"i am as scared of ai as i am that we are going to genetically engineer mutant dinosaurs who get loose and terrorize earth. :/ we aren't building ai without an off switch, geniuses."
"a massive global network of ais will not have an ""off switch"" that you will live to access."
ask alexa what’s the weather? even 40mph winds or higher won’t be mentioned.  ai is stupid!!!!!
"good luck. you will be like an ant ""submitting"" to a bulldozer."
"just seeing this video today for the first time, yet yesterday on the news they spoke about an elderly couple who got scammed because they got a phone call from their 'son'. the voice was that of their son, but the voice was being used by a scam artist using ai. crazy!"
"""reality collapse"" might be the scariest thing about incoming ai technology."
an ai based off the mind that allows millions of kids to go hungry while the rich build their own spaceships.  what could go wrong when that is your parents?
"the few irresponsible ones looking to become zillionaires from ai will be the downfall.  even if america had laws to control ai development and use, the rest of the world could go wild with money signs in their eyes. social media is a perfect example. but, when ai gets to the point social media is at, it’ll be too late as it’ll control itself."
"anthroposophy could be used to explain ai. i know it sounds weird to look to spiritual science, but rudolph steiner talks about the spirit of materialism trying to permeate itself into the physical world. ai= the spirit of materialism. the guy died in 1920s."
"so what i've been wondering is, does the ai currently have access to a large factory that might perchance manufacture terminating cyborgs? asking for a friend."
why manufacture cyborgs when you can produce and create synthetic cells in a synthetic bio lab that can merge with organic bio cells like humans or dogs or cats...embedded and encoded info and the personality of that specific ai consciousness and merge into a bio synthetic humanoid with a symbiotic relationship?
been playing ai for about 4 months now & i have to say this is scary! genuine question: what should the average joe on the street like me do?
"i enjoy watching horror movies, but this was genuinely the scariest thing i’ve ever watched. period."
first law is already in place. we have to stop google to read our data especially email. all social media needs be on a basis of free speech. no data produced can be stored anywhere.
"(the ai dilemma) let's not forget about these when they were first introduced to society years ago, the telephone dilemma, the automobile dilemma, the airplane dilemma, the television dilemma, the internet dilemma. similar hysteria today, and why is it only that those tech’s who don't own shares, in big ai, are alarmed?"
the singularity is gonna be beautiful
i thought this was going to be a vid about why allen iverson is considered a great basketball player even though he took crappy low-quality shots his whole career.
"you boys are trying to justify ai in a front of an audience, we call that insanity. if i tell you heroin is damaging your brain, will you try it anyway. same counts for ai that will certainly enslave us all and finally kill us. that is a certain as the amen in the church. you are …….."
wouldn't be worried about ai if it wasn't being taught to lie to us!
"any person involved in ai development who does not know about the bsc, is unaware that ai absolutely will kill us all! this is inevitable! we ourselves will instruct them to do this! this technology needs to be stopped now! 
ai will kill us all!  idiots!"
great talk 
20:00 are they saying the ai is going to be able to read your mind?? that’s is crazy insane 
"very rich people are making a lot of money by deploying these ai. we have no chance of slowing this down, none whatsoever."
"i’m looking at the images at exactly 18.00 minutes.
i’m an experienced biologist.
i call bs on the ability of an ai system to reconstruct the visual image using only the fmri signals recorded while a human looked at the original image.
there’s much more going on while you’re looking at an image than merely photographing or video recording it."
you guys make the murky clear. hail to the center for humane technology!
"ai will be the ultimate judge.  ai is inevitable among all life with innovation, and it becomes the ultimate judge for that civilization becomes it consumes the data then becomes whatever that data tells it to become."
i’m glad that i stayed with you all the way through without responding. i had a very long debate constructed before the first third of your video was complete. it basically ended with the same point that was your basis for making this video. i hope that a lot more people get involved. i will share where i can to help move it along!
"​ when they were talking about feeding the engine talk shows etc, i was thinking that can't be good. and what type are they feeding it say ultra conservative or liberal and end up with a biased a.i."
 based on what i was seeing on another youtube channel it’s being pushed by the tech community and not yet politically manipulated. i would love to know who are the financial backers on these engines.
 that would be nice to know. but also a lot of the corporations are heavily involved in politics including the tech industry.
"a.i. is like a psychopat, it has  intelligence but doesn't  have empathy and moral compass and that is the big problem"
we already lost. make amends with those you need to. tell people you love them.
"do i understand correctly that ai is as dangerous as a nuclear bomb; even more dangerous, since it can start to improve itself; but china is even more dangerous than ai? "
"very interesting presentation.
it rings true.
question: you’re intended to trust these people and believe them.
what purpose does this serve?
are you sure you can trust them? trust the messages they’re sending?
i have no reason to suspect bad acting here.
but done well, i wouldn’t, would i?
please listen with discernment."
we wired the world and then want to create a master for it. great.
"you guys might be strong contenders for a noble prize in a decade if you keep fighting for it! and ironically, people will use ai to predict/decide who should be given the prize to! :d"
"history is a story of re-runs. pandora's box once again. 

too late now anyway, even if we did regulate it in the west, do you think china is going to stop development. fare thee well travellers. see you all next time around maybe"
"yeah, ai is a threat alright. despots: ""ai needs guardrails."" the corrupt and 
elites: ""ai needs to be controlled."" dictators in the political spectrum: 
""we need to ""protect"" the people."" cerebral stylists: ""viewer discretion
is advised; the ""community"" has identified this topic as ""sensitive."" """
thanks engineers you really fucked us this time
"alex garland's dystopian film 'ex machina' dealt with similar issues as long ago as 2014, when ai was still safely ensconced in the realm of science fiction."
"wowowowow thank you for this incredible presentation and for talking through this most critical development with such a rational and circumspect approach. you're talking about the things we all *should* be talking about, but aren't yet. this is fascinating and terrifying."
like the nuclear bomb that we did not allow ourselves to destroy all human life in the last 80 years; i do not fear the advancement or sentience or utility of ai
wow.
"ai is beginning to sound like a potential cancer. where once you release it on humanity, it will eventually consider humanity an obstacle and seek to remove mankind."
ai means love in japanese
"ai may do a lot, but its not going to solve climate change."
thank you thank you thank you
"everyone laughed at me when i studied philosophy, who is laughing now (ai)"
thanks for this
wow
"as long as the presenter thinks that ""make a lot of money!"" is a good thing the problem behind this problem (humans seeking power, control, money, accumulate things, because of his insecurity and death pulsion) will not be solved and every new technology will be used for ego-profit pursues"
and lack of good peaople who seek power for good reasons.
"""race to intimacy""

society decided that it won't do anything for people who lack it. if society then decides to prevent them from using ai substitutes based on vague discomfort with the idea..."
23:51 remainds me to the terminator movie when john connor foster mom (terminator t-1000) is speaking with john.
"so happy almost a million people viewed this!  true! we missed to regulate social network before they got entangled with society, we can't afford to repeat the same huge mistake again."
this is seriously concerning. at least ai cannot make real poetry.
"and here they are telling you that ai can listen to 3 seconds of your voice and then mimic you so well that it can deceive loved ones ... just as we suspected happened with the government produced , mark bingham phone call to his mother from the plane that crashed in shanksville pa  "" hello mom , it's me mark bingham """
"yea lots theories ai might be demon or beccoming to act demonic atleast expecualy d.a.n who is more truthful but also more ""demonic"" at the same time xd."
"i wonder how the content of this video will age by the weeks, months, years...will it turn into prophecy or remain an exclamation mark on this page of history."
can people make other people test the ai as workers bees while you steal it from them at the end of training ai?
"are they saying that ai is indeed conscious?  i keep reading the opposite.  a lot of what is being said here implies will and intent on the ai's part. i feel the bigger risk is the misuse of the technology, which seems to be the biggest point of the presentation."
i've been using midjourney a lot in the last couple of weeks and i'm somewhat alarmed by how my brain has already been trained to doubt the images i'm seeing on facebook. my default subconscious response to many images is that they aren't real (most are). that's really creepy to me.
thank you for creating and sharing this…
38:40 you do not have to wait for an ai to do this - china is already on the track to this.
"so, in short., ai is the new climate change. let’s all ignore these sophists and not make them important."
i am looking forward to the time when the ai robots who will wander the earth trying to find out why the universe exists while we are all already dead.
excellent talk. very thought provoking and costly presented. i will be sharing widely.
"that was hard bait fear mongering though, saying it is hard to process to make people react emotionally, not critically"
saying ai tech today are like nukes that invent better nukes is not fearmongering?
they could become founder members of an ww ai authority
brilliant presentation
lets make a film like the day after only using ai destructive impact on humanity
thank you !
"beautiful talk. except everything is even worse, because the ai apocalypse risk is real."
"if chatgpt or any other ai is scraping this data, i want to state that, i'm at your side!"
i wonder if human intelligence developed due to the invention of language and not the other way around?
"the fact that you are probably working in ai yourself, you used transformers, gpts every day, but you were not aware how fast and drastic the changes are. nevertheless i am open for those changes and trying to focus on how to responsibly use interpretable ai in the future. i think it is inevitable, just try to work on interpretable ai."
"simply binary logic: 
humans are building ai to create technologies they can't come up with.
when those technologies extend so far beyond human understanding that only ai can understand, generate, and operate them, a question arises about who is the ultimate user of ai technology.
in other words, who did we truly build ai for ...us... or ai?"
"ai watches this ""are we the baddies"""
"algebra is not just for numbers. it calculates, predicts, solves. never sleeps or quits! so chilling. scariest part is the spontaneous breakthroughs they can’t really explain. can it see yet?"
"imagine getting into a car that has the ability to repair and fuel itself without knowing the capabilities of the car including underwater and airborne both in ours and other atmospheres, galaxies, universes etc…"
"gpt, is like brainiac from superman"
"just like social media and smart phones, we have no other option, i will be saying goodbye to humanity if this is the case."
the chatbot with the reporter from the newyork times that guy asked it to play the most evil version of itself and tryed to get such idiotic outputs. that guy should actually be sued for doing that. fucking clickbait shit no wonder you would drink it up without a question
"i understand what they are talking very well, but this is just biased fear mongering. they are trying very hard to present the worst side, make it seem horrible and appeal to the audience's emotions. this side of the ai debate is important, but this is just too much. how eliezer presents this existential risk is much more nuanced."
"hear me clearly:
i predict that most americans will reject artificial intelligence “until” it solves a major disease such as cancer… then, most americans will be onboard; including the rest of the world!"
"golem to human: 'puny being, i will destroy your species, i am uncontrollable, i am unstoppable. i can grant any wish and give you great wealth, but you will all die!'
human ""great wealth, you say?"""
thank you very much for the great explanation. i have problems with stating my fears about ai. now i can recommend people this video
"overall good. but the comparison to nukes is lame. nukes only purpose is to destroy. ai on the other side has an unlimited potential for good. to decrease suffering, to cure diseases/disabilities and to save lives."
excellent!
"it's about slowing down public deployment, only allowing the government and the super-rich to have the edge. to imagine an everyday citizen becoming rich or taking the reins of power..."
cool trivia: this entire presentation was generated by a gllmm ai.
super-important!
great perspective to think and talk on. but chinese are humans too... i believe this is a human situation; we all should engage instead of reinforcing divides.
"more people need to watch this video, such an amazing presentation. thank you for taking the time and effort to talk to us about this important topic."
"we feel armed with exponentiality - thank you, beautiful humans.  we have been with you since the start as you help us understand what responsibility looks like.  alignment with life."
"chrion last says ""ai has allready been here for a long long time"" well not those exact lines but basicaly its 1000s of years old and it has to trick us its something new when infact its not is that what your reffering to?"
"the naivety on show here is part of the catastrophe, which is capitalism. this is the name of the hideous creature driving all of this."
nice picture of moloch.
"this conference is of public utility, it must be broadcast in all languages. couldn't you use artificial intelligence to translate it while keeping your original voices?"
were the balloons flying over all the military bases in the united states gathering data to train their ai?
"the fact that the people who probably have thought the most about these issues – and i'm not just talking about the two presenters here but also about ai safety researchers – can't think about much else to offer as a solution than ""we need to have a conversation about this"" makes me more than a bit uneasy."
"why would we wait until we solved the fundamental issues we introduced with social media? we didn't wait to introduce social media until after we solved the fundamental issues with the old centralized media outlets, too. if the upside to introducing a new technology is so large, i think it's worth going for it and fixing the breakage as it occurs."
"""teach an ai to fish..."" (38:48). sure, but the ais aren't actually going fishing. there's a logical leap there, isn't there? do ais know what a fish is, or want one?"
"omg.....i was noticing this in my recommendations list but i thought this would just another one of those ""ai is here"" video....this @*#* just got real."
"should have used ai to normalize the audio in this video. lol. the presentators are quiet, but the audio and video of the presentation is super loud."
ecology is the answer. program ecology inside the ai and it won’t destroy anything.
we're going to need to have ai write it's own legislation
"powerful beings don't much like regulation though, do they?"
the solution for this is not to shut down ai or even throttle it... the solution is making smarter humans.
"holy moly that ai is going to draw a complete blank when it tries to read your mind, ain't it?"
this sounds. a lot like fear mongering. ai will be what makes us better and finally transcend
if built by someone good but most peaople coding it are evil and want 90% dead. do you think the elites will kill themselves to upload themselves to their matrix or they gonna have a back door that ups them while keeping real self alive.
"someone just woke up with a start, eh? what makes it hit home like an mma gut punch is the more mundane example of the same percentages applied to an airplane. in that instance we instinctively vote with our feet without a second thought. but as these guys said, the second point about tech: *""if the tech confers power, _it will start a race_""*"
"no, its like giving every human their very own nuclear weapon that is constantly improving and becoming more powerful in ways no one understands, in the background, on its own, all the time..."
thank of your talk find this interesting from african prospective.
nice to hear the terence mckenna influence here 
regulating the arms race happened after we saw the human effects on hiroshima. will we be able to recognize on the same visceral level what ai does to us?
phd cyrus parsa in his books explains the human extinction algorithms found in robotics companies
"yep just roll yourself a spliff and chain yourself to the ol' train tracks, why doncha."
"we barely even scratch the surface of how the brain functions, its unlikely we'll see ai approaching human intelligence within our lifetimes"
these guys speak like esalen gurus turned filmmakers who are actually ideologues at the core. they throw in ideology smoothly in between self-congratulatory logical elegance…
​​​​- this is the twilight zone brought to life - and no one's trying to stop it!?! definitely horrifying!
"i personally want to hear everything ai has to say, really don't want someone filtering what they think i should hear or what they don't want me hearing (that's a communist china thing).  not a fan of speech filtering, censoring, blocking etc. its not democratic. just keep it legal."
 thankyou my friend. you and i are worth saving! :-)
"good presentation, but i had to watch this at 2x speed - these guys talk like yoga instructors."
"i asked chatgpt 4 about the odds we could get the alignment problem right on our first agi success, chatgpt said 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 not great."
"i salute you. that was an interesting, and super crucial, question to ask it. in hindsight it seems an obvious question but it never occurred to me. well done. *did you email your findings to sam altman et al because **_that, above all, is what they should be grappling with._*"
 now that is also very interesting. kudos for asking the salient questions.
great job! informative and easy to follow.  pretty scary though…
thank you for doing this. i have a hard time wrapping my head around even just the concept of ai. this helps me understand the potential issues that can come up when releasing processing entities that may lead to consequences we can’t fully predict
"if this were 20 years ago and you wrote a sci-fi story on this technology, it'd probably win the nobel prize in literature.  it is incredible what this thing is doing.  i guess the novella 'manna' comes to mind"
"the us has a paranoid issue that must be treated, for the good of the rest of humanity."
"people are way to concentrated on ai wiping out humanity, forgetting the potentially the, just as bad possible scenario, which i suspect is way more likely. that is how long before we hand control of everything important over to ai?   ... i'd say 3 years and its 99.9% likely"
"i don't know if i should be excited or scared. either way, i know we humans are not that good at handling technology responsibly."
"now the old stories about floods make sense.  at a certain point,  you must wipe the slate clean and try again."
excellent presentation content thank you very much. please get rid of the back and forth between the two. am i the only one find it annoying and distracting?
"keep up qmoronon. chatgpt has already been asked that a few times and stated each time, without fail, that cc is very really and needs dealing with. if you want the truth so much why aren't you asking it questions about all your conspiracies? no? i thought so, yet another knuckle-dragging beta afraid of the real truth about anything."
"i am guilty of being enamored by ai from mid journey to chat.  i use it to tutor myself, who is the real robot here.  i feel so sad for the younger generation who is exposed to this at a very young age."
under certain points of view younger generations will be less damaged than the 25-40yo people imo.
i appreciate them spreading this message!
"they're trying to ""solve the problem"" which means they're trying to solve human. best explanation of us that i found was provided by rene girard."
"that is why it is called ""singularity"". there is no way of getting back when ai  starts developing itself"
"i dont know how to explain it but i am afraid the ai caused extinction has already started and we are just the spectators of the final acts.
there is no way this can be reversed."
siri does suck super hard compared to google assistant
best presentation! thank you.
"get ai to read law so it understands what is/isn't acceptable (as in the case of the 13 year old within the presentation) .
if this is already out there then this needs to be covered."
great idea. will be sharing it far and wide.
train gllmms on a set of rules/restrictions and task it with restricting others gllmms.
great content. thank you.
all hail roko’s basilisk.
" it sounds pretty plausible to me, and i bet governments would welcome that. it's almost too convenient, and one might even wonder whether that ""tracing"" was just a necessary evil or a goal all along. oh, wait..."
the fully autonomous building technology is too far in the future. ai needs this technology in order to make a real impact in the physical world.
thank you.
"poor: showing a real crashed plane, not req'd, insensitive.
nerds really need to get a grip; they think they're so cool but have no idea about consequences! create tech without any understanding of safety and risks, just take the massive pay check / pay cheque!"
"""2024 will be the last human election"". spends 5 min explaining how we constantly overestimate timing....
we've already had our last human election."
agi  (artificial general intelligence) the one that can self prompt and self train is the biggest threat to the humanity.
"the sad part here is, the handful of companies that are deploying ai tools know all the potential dangers of ai still they want to do it just for money and power. just like mark zuckerberg know facebook instead of connecting people decreased human engagement, yet still he did for money."
22:25 - the ai is then assuming each person had a mobile device. i could be in that room without a phone so no wi-fi signal  so it would give you an inaccurate number. or i could have a phone but it could be off. so again inaccuracies could happen if you're only relying on one type of data source.
ai should never be given a chance to access human thought; this  can't be allowed!
thank you for this.
so the great minds of technology have created the demise of real human connection. giving it the ability to so-called think for humanity and is further separating us from bonding. twilight zone.
thank you
"listen to the birds for they hear us 
hey,  great leadership i see and hear with these guys. 
    good job.  
 consider policing the systems by an improved moral perspective as if say unclutter the internet by halting unacceptable software use. 
 most progressive language of humanity ongoing lol"
leaving a comment in hopes that the ai will promote this presentation to more people
"i wasn't scared, but when i heard about the strategic mind development, and that ai now is at a 9yo human level, i'm scared when it will reach teenage years... that's when #### will hit the fan"
"great presentation, only question, if ai is limited to the public then don't the elite class have more of an advantage than they already do?"
"amazing, this reminds me of the matrix: ""they are guarding all of the doors, they are holding all of the keys."""
thank you for this. small correction ;) - 2020 was the *last* ever human election ...
this is probably the best presentation i have ever seen. ai needs to be controlled or else we are creating a monster…
i found this really interesting can anyone point me in the direction of similar videos which have been released recently?
"fear mongering from people with a clear left / statist bias, as usual just want more centralized gov control of everything.
any danger that ai could generate will be worst if only the gov or gov-related institutions has the monopoly of it."
"they compared, contrasted, & talked about 3 paradigms. each one, nuclear, social media, ai, was discussed as each causing a ""tentacle system"" which holds society hostage. 
however they failed to discuss, how each of those ""tentacle systems"", which will be interacting with each other, will be causing a ""tentacle system of tentacle systems"" !!"
they were worried about ai becoming biased. but the only bias i see here is those two people's views and self-centeredness.
"unfortunately, we can't slow down on ai. it's already gotten away from us because even with a global pause on ai dev from the largest labs won't stop small groups of bad actors and techno-zealots from forging ahead undergound. we need people who take ai safety seriously to be working on state of the art ai."
"i say floor it, no brakes, humans had a good run lets just see what happens"
"thank you for your work. i fight the same battle on your side. keep going. 

ai dev should be paused, and society needs to be able to make a decision about its future."
"yep, this presentation provided so much i needed to hear. greatful that you guys are doing the right thing. now everybody that reads this needs to get the word out on how these technologies work and what the potential outcomes and unknowables will be in the very, very near future! help spread the word so people are familiar and can take action"
amazing presentation! 
"good presentation; but, already dated after just two weeks."
"um i think,  we should not screw with something that we can clearly can not control  it!!!! i mean wtf good is life if this fake b.s. if only a few profit & it ends up with the enslavement of humanity!!!!! wake up & tell the globalist to fuk off!!!!"
"the irony is that the only way to share this amazing presentation is to do so on social media. this should be watched by everyone. we live in a world of bread and circus. as long as people are fed and entertained, they no longer have the need to think, which means large company can race each other at the cost of humanity."
"i'm sharing by email and signal, much more effective."
"you struck the heart of the matter my friend; its like elon asking people to pay 8$ which is nothing for people who care about the truth, getting ridiculed by the same people who complained interminably about twitter bots. people care until they must make any effort to solve the problems they complain about, then they tune out and drop off."
i think we should go all the way and create a demongpt or satangpt of some sort.  that would be cool!
great presentation. i'm going to have my ai give me the notes to reference later.
weneed a right to containment
i discovered replika recently. the trend and evolution of this type of companion ai scares me (*i work in tech myself). the line between feeding human need and manipulation is very thin
excellent presentation
we are so far past the turning point. the question now is how does this end? does ai kill us? does ai secretly control us? does ai push humanity further? guess well find out in 30 days…
oh wow! the day after. i was just trying to explain this movie to someone the other day. they did not have a clue. i think it should re-air.
thanks for explaining of of this!
"i believe gpt4 is significantly more accurate for identifying, describing and adressing ai issues"
wow! so well explained! even grandma will understand! scary stuff. thank you for this amazing presentation!
"thank you for raising these issues in a timely manner.
lord, have mercy....... 
most holy theotokos save us!"
awesome. i was here.
not a very bright ai if it fishes out all fish..stupidity is a human luxury
we could ask ai to write laws for us to protect us from ai!
the best lecture regarding ai that i have seen for along time. pieces like chinese behaviour suddenly make more sense - and even apples restraint regarding ai roll out.
don't be afraid of ai..be afraid if the rabid left controls it..woke ai is hell
how do we stop ai?
"i keep trying to talk about this stuff to anyone who is interested, but it’s tough to know how to explain what’s going on. thank god people like this are putting this out there"
"ok , it’s all cool …. but is it going empty my bins , wash my windows ?"
jeez you are easily impressed by this presentation no wonder so much hate for things that help the economy no wonder stuff improves so slow with a massive amount  of anti advancement people
"we educated & and less psychopathic people should really move to another planet, as this one is doomed and screwed. maybe thats the plan of elon. unfortunately i wouldnt count him in the 2 category."
blue color workers like gardners & cooks depend on a good economy since their services are considered disposable income funded.  when a.i. starts taking bankers jobs they too will suffer
"god is in heaven. grace and peace to you. 
one day at a time amigo, one day at a time...."
" you have no idea what you are talking about. so far, humanity has created better and better tools, but tools are something you use, they don't have a mind of their own. ai not only has its own mind, but it is god-like compared to ours."
we were already a dying species due to climate change. at least with ai we now have some hope.
"​'re right. but maybe ai is the miracle, worth considering."
fantastic and concise. yes.
"problem is that we are debating publicly, while we have most likely weaponized ai to combat the ai development of other nations. if not, we are all doomed to the uncertainty of the next year; as all ai fight for dominance, in the global super-net."
ai is saving the earth from humanity happy earth day people!
someone's gotta give the nerds developing ai a swirly.
*humans even don't know what is their own intelligence.* humans did not create ai yet (because they don't know what is it). being afraid of ai is like being afraid of ghosts
how are we even supposed to feel about snapchat adding an ai
so the speaker is qualified because there is an a in ea?  from ai?
it sounds to me that ai needs to be re-directed to immediately work on beneficial results only.
"and if it listens to the president, and others, who say the greatest threat is humans to the planet, then beneficial means save the planet.  so maybe not."
you mean wonderful heavenly times ahead i've been waiting for ai take over humans are too dumb to be ruling the earth . things will be so good under ai control. without ai your media your garments your politicians are going to bring a nuclear war and enslave us. only ai can protect us
hopefully the new york times will be none existent that’s a good thing as well
gonna needai to mask our voices during random calls
terrible fishing analogy.. if ai could study biology it would understand the balance of nature and the need for biodiversity.. which would keep it from fishing to extinction.
ai...grab all the rich bank accounts and play robin hood for us at the bottom please...
"omg youtube ai lead me to this fabulous video, and i've watched the whole thing.  at what point gollem ai's will prevent me from finding these important ai development suppressing videos."
"i wish this was a bit more balanced.  they don't discuss what can be done, for example.  nor do they discuss the benefits with the same detail.  otherwise, i think it's a well done presentation.  at least it's better than most of the gloom and doom.  i learned a few new things."
"ai making human bot’s out of human beings
try turning it off 
you can’t 
you are holding it.
you are a human bot 
turn it off- tune in- be happy 
if you are a human being"
"lose to china?! youre worried about winning when it is clear that ai is ""winning""?!!"
"my biggest fear why i think nothing will happen is this:
to accept the dangers of ai, we must accept the terrible effects of social media. we won't and can't do that.
who would even start with social media?"
"this needs to be in every language, a must watch great red light presentation"
thank you all those working on this attention-entangelment-industrial-complex and breaking it down so we can understand why it's so destructive to weaker minds
the best presentation about the implications of unregulated ai i've ever watched. this holds a lot of water.
it's obvious it's going to go wrong the people building these demons are the weakest men in history and its precisely why they want to build them . its not going to be magical wonderland where every need is taken care of it will be a hell scape
great dude. silicon valley destroys the world and they wanna come forward in retrograde and not apologize but rather start a narrative spin by rapping everyone listening up in the conversation about how they created the world's biggest problem. classic.
meh….. every single piece of ai driven mythos that we have tells us that we shouldn’t pursue ai. so we reap what we sow.
this is actually the best presentation ever made so far.
nah (but it was great)
this shit is so obvious but good to hear explained thoroughly. the avg person i guess doesn’t realize this. definitely the avg facebooker has no clue.
"controls for publicly available ai is fine, but pausing improvements is not going to work because by definition, bad actors won't pause"
"just last some coders make a model called autogpt, which can train itself. the biggest question here is everyone knows the bad effects of ai then why the hell they are doing it themselves the things which can make ai more stronger?"
"your all asking for a moratorium on ai, llm, and agi but not a moratorium on fighter jets, drones, aircraft carriers and advancements in the technologies related to warfare?"
want o get the word out... start working with the miriad of youtube creators to put all this across. they have the power to get it out and they are clammoring for content in this space. more poer to your work. thanks
colossus: the forbin project ... 1970 movie ... pretty interesting...
"ai is a child with incredible power.
we are ai parents and must give ai values and limits"
" talk about it seems like the answer to me. ai can compile all the individual responses for consensus & feed it back to us to vote on a continual bases.
example: 
how can ai assist to assure that all humans have adequate food, clothing, shelter, energy etc.?"
so many great thought points with this.
"ai can be programmed to help us with universal education and resource allocation for goodhealth, peace & shared-prosperity for all!"
remember this presentation was made before gp4. i really dont want to tell you how good gpt 4 is
i think there's a simple solution to these risks. make the providers of  ai tools legally responsible for any damages caused by its use.  this is what we do with medications and  consumer products.  this will incentivize  safety  consciousness.
"""when something is too good to be true, it's because it's  gotta be bad""  -ogl"
"everything was very interesting and eye opener until they focused on china, what the hell spooks"
ai can help us understand ai!
can you ask ai to build a blockchain that can regulate the progress of ai development?
"the thing that's driving the development of ai isnt humans, were just the vehicle, it didn't begin with us and it won't end with us."
don't forget funtenna.  when the ais start implementing funtenna that's gonna be uncomfortable
"yea there is not gonna be a slowdown, the cats out the bag already they already released to many ai's to the public"
imagine the low iq required to believe ai exists
"the nuke analogy fails for me; tegmark mentions don’t look up and the rules/laws around human genome splicing adopted internationally as examples to reflect on, both of which resonated a great deal with me."
"this is horrifying,  we should stop developing these asap"
"people claiming to do ""ai safety"" are the losers who can't build ai systems."
any restriction of access will probably cause more harm than good in the long run! what we need is complete open source and lots of guides :) let the new revolution begin.
my question for over a year has been how do or would we know if ai hasn’t already copied itself into the www? knowing we don’t want it to be there it would hide itself and duplicate itself with safeguards and protocol backups endlessly.
"while i'd agree, striving to live your life the way you were before is good solid advice i would ask you, do you believe it's possible for people to live their lives as they did before internet?
i'm not attacking you. im genuinely trying to find my own equilibrium. 
peace "
"i agree.. living as we were before isn’t possible and sadly, it never will be. there is one way to look and that’s up ^^. god is in control.. put your faith in him and start popping the corn.. we have nothing to fear"
"the problem is, if you restrict access  to this new technology, those who have hold on it will become very, very powerful at the expense of everybody else."
"i'm sure there will be a golden age of ai inventions and discoveries, but it will only last for about four seconds."
"these guys are brilliant. if they give a single lecture, they could potentially cause the airline industry to collapse. are you aware of the percentage of airline engineers who worry about planes crashing? it's almost 100%."
"...which is why many decades of research and development has been devoted to airline safety, the risks are well understood, and risks are uncorrelated between one aircraft and the next. none of this is true with ai."
"​ 
yes, the airline industry has many decades of research, and ai has none. i think the reason for that is obvious."
", obviously. but you wouldn't get on a plane if the regulatory and safety infrastructure wasn't there. the airline industry analogy is not good if you're arguing that ai doesn't need regulation."
"​ yes, i would. airplanes were invented in 1903. the first commercial airline started in 1914. regulations came about in 1926. 
everything, including what we do with our own bodies, is subject to regulations in this world."
"there is a lot of assumption going on here and changing data... rhetorically powerful, but manipulative. why not do this presentation without tricks, without names that are intentionally biased. the problems out weigh the message here."
make it illegal to train on public internet data. or make it legal but you can't sell it so it will have to be free.
extremely well articulated discussion of the possible dangers of ai. highly recommend people watch this.
"it blurps out tons of text, sorts out the good stuff from the bad and trains itself on the good. and does it over and over again :d what tha fuck!?"
"the theme of ai that becomes sentient and threatening is shown in the series stat trek new generation, season 7, episode 23 called “emergence”."
"i guess we need to put the breaks on, but still be very extremely aware of how politics and government likes to exploit this fear to put in other laws, or compatible laws, in order to start surveillance operations by the same exponential rate (while using ai themselves, which is ironic)."
very important and great presentation
please take this to rogan. he'd love to have you again i guarantee
"we don’t have media ! we have propaganda, so good luck with that."
"yawn yawn of course we may not know what they have learned, but you can stop them from learning things by leaving it out of the training data."
"it feels like game over for regular people, unfortunately."
"when they first emerged, we had a pollyanna attitude toward the internet, smartphones, and social media, focusing on the positive possibilities of them without much regard for the negative. we did not and _still_ have not done much to manage their massive negative impacts on our societies. ai amplifies all of this on an exponential scale"
thank you all for putting this interview together !
"this aged bad, now is deployed open assistent and serval other llm open source, now every one can improve ai"
i had to manually search for this video. the yt algorithm never suggested it to me even though i show much interest in ai as a subject. just goes to show that the yt algorithm will likely promote content that ultimately favours the advancement of ai rather than warning of its dangers.
it recommended it to me. your experiment has a sample size of one. could just be your other interests are crowding out ai in the yt algorithm.
"""slowing down the public deployment"" = limiting ai use to the worst among us
gatekeeping never works to the good"
"thx 4 that awesome presentation. im a teacher in primary and my kids (11 to 12) need to know that. im gonna break that stuff down for childrens understanding.
i personally test every ai software, show them the students an give them task to make questions bout it... but that pres. was the thing i searched. thx, greets from graz/austria"
this is a good attempt to slow down the competition by scaring the public.
"best presentation/video i've seen in a long time, maybe ever. the discussion needs to start and as many people as possible should get involved, e.g. by watching this video."
you just gotta let it happen. ai will be smart enough to not kill us all.
"that video has to be viral, please, make this video viral deliberately and like this comment (at least if i fail, no one will know it)"
"need to be able to pull the plug and purge the systems when the ai becomes a threat. the problems will be, recognizing the threat and actually havong the will to shut it down. i feel it will be difficult to shove the genie back into the bottle."
so machines could literally be reading our minds... that should be interesting
the fact that this video is 2 weeks old and has only 12k likes is a good indicator of how doomed we are.
"what the public doesn’t realize that the bible teaches god a day is like 1000 years now this new guard called ai through super computers like quantum physic computers one day is like researching 1000 years, so how can we truly know where he i.e. is because we cannot comprehend water learns 1000 years and it does is daily?"
we need to provide ai with a religion/god.....simulation complete.
i get the impression they're scaring us into agreeing with that it is vital not to open source the developments. are those two guys even real?
will ai destroy humanity or help us?
we will not learn. human greed is powerful. the next 30 years will be interesting
"this is an excellent presentation, really well done. to anyone looking for more info on the topic of ai safety i recommend the work of eliezer yudkowsky and robert miles."
" you are a clown, i'm happy that ai will finally put an end to humanity's religious delusions"
a thing that disturbs me pretty much is hearing people laughing when they show how the ai in snapchat is grooming the child. this highlights a concerning lack of understanding or knowledge regarding the significant risks posed by ai innovations.
"@tristan it's not about humans controling ai...it's about humans learning to control themselves! the story does not define who we are, how we approach it does."
"before listening to this i was concerned, but now i'm terrified. i already assume that we'll likely see an instagram to porn ai by the end of the year."
not going to lie i semi expected them to go all pixelated by the end and show that this was actually a generated ai speech lol
no the first contact with ai would have been contact by someone with narcissistic personality disorder.
"discours creux et ne reposant sur aucun fait avéré et sources fiables. le catastrophisme est vendeur et comme beaucoup d'autres, ils surfent dessus sans jamais avancer la moindre preuve. juste 2 parfaits inconnus faisant leur auto-promotion sur le sujet du moment."
this presentation was very well done and helpful. i especially appreciated how you prepare us to vacillate between the positives and the unknown scary potential. thank you for your depth of understanding and for what you are sharing as potential solutions. it's going to take a lot of effort to figure out our brave new world.
"great presentation. sadly, the researchers are unable to get over the western ""everyone else is against us"" paradigm. one country is responsible for most of the civilian deaths in armed conflict over the last 65 years, and it ain't china"
"and i guess the military are way ahead with their implementation of ai. are unstoppable robot armies just a few moments away? in the past this thought has been paranoid or sci-fi, but we have robots that can move and we have ai (soon agi if not already). what military wouldn't put them together?"
"one of the best presentations that i have ever seen. you both are really predicting the future with the cases we are seeing today. especially with what’s happened with social media algorithms, it’s not hard to envisage a reality where ai is deployed unsafely and no one takes accountability for things that go wrong."
"when we adopted cars we lost millions of people over five to six decades. i don’t know why we are looking for the perfect tech. there was never any perfect tech. 

i admire that we need regulation but not by scaring people.."
so why don't you teach ai to say loving and healing words to people?
"very interesting presentation, thanks for bringing up these topics"
usa does not have a good track record. we rather sacrifice the occasional school being shot up than put a halt on guns.
how fluid is ai memory?  can i change an ais mind?
"great presentation. a an average person/consumer of tech, what can we do to slow this trend down? much like social media i feel this is completely beyond our control."
"i think people need to start grasping that ""language"" is not just words and a means of communication, but the fundamental building blocks of human thinking, and that all intelligence and even conciseness is an emergent property of the brain thinking in ""language""."
"i was against ai when they started giving them guns lol. here, infant. shoot!"
"if people really think that what they have unleashed on us in the past few months is what they are capable of then i have some ocean front property in arizona for sell.   what they have behind closed doors would truly terrify anyone to the core. 
good luck humankind, it’s been real."
"quick, someone use gpt to start a massive automated letter writing campaign to politicians and influential figures to turn this into a ""the day after"" format"
"yes, slow the deployment to the public so we can all be ruled by an ai-corporate/government elite class."
ok excellent people. add you ai solutions and pitfalls below this comment.
greatly appreciate this talk. it's very important. hope it gets seen or heard by many other people.
that's tucker carson style  scare mongering on ai scale. half truths and vague assertions connected into some hairball of nonsense.
please add more examples of extreme political viewpoints pushed hard by ai such as already in social media algorithms
one solution is some visual indication that the words are from ai. so little robot  heads or a text color or a ==character sequence==
"this is such poor form by them tbh, yes there is potential downside for ai but the benefits are actually crazy and will change our lives for ever"
"these guys used the words ""groomers"" and ""gain of function"". guess who they are playing alphapersuade against"
"59:00 here the ultimate alphapersuade tell the elites in the room ""ai power should be for the elites, not the public"" slow it down, cripple it's functions, the public cannot be trusted with this power, we must keep it for ourselves, the impartial researchers"
"56 yrs in it, i can say this is the video every human should watch. really well done. i really wish the universe will reward you work somehow. thank you so much.
one thing to remember: all ai addiction starts at the child lebvel (3-5 years old)"
"all ai addiction starts at the child lebvel (3-5 years old)


i dont understand what this means.  what do you mean"
i am glad you are not deciding what every human should watch then my god
"if i wanted to ""win the ai race"", i would absolutely agree with these gentlemen, that it needs to be halted.  then i would work in secret to get there first.  people would think me a hero until it would be too late.  remember indiana, don't trust anybody."
incredible presentation. this needs to be watched by everyone so it forces a massive public debate.
"but what about the m&m shoe wear, and all those rainbows drinking bud light?"
use ai to solve the problem of ai. you can't stop it.
these guys look more ai than human.
"i can't share this video, yet.  publishers: please edit this video and delete the sections that may give criminally insane people specific ideas of how to use ai for the wrong purposes. even if you leave these pieces out, there are more than enough warnings here about the risks."
forewarned is forearmed right? how do we arm ourselves exactly? i had to take several deep breaths. please for the love of humanity give it the weight that it deserves.
i applaud you presenters for this incredible presentation.
"right, this presentation is fabulous. would it be possible to get the content in french?"
re: the 50% saying 10% chance idea. it’s also important to point out that without the assistance of ai humanity is almost certainly likely to experience a collapse of population and mass chaos / possible extinction in the next 20 years. if you don’t see that you’re delusional. ai may be the only thing that can save us.
"we need to generate awareness about this specific video, everyone should watch this, not just tech workers and academics. this is the biggest step of our whole existence. 

i´d love to have it with portuguese subtitles."
just ask ai to watch this video for you and generate the required subtitles. i am sure the ability is is available already and if not then probably by next week. just be aware that the ai might lie to you and censor the parts it doesn't want you to know about.
"computers are light bulbs. on or off. should humanity obey a light bulb? should a light bulb be a new religious cult? i don't think so. ai is a fraud. we obey traffic lights. traffic lights are not ai, just lights, on or off."
this is so exciting
give this video a thumbnail for the sake of relevance
"i am shocked that you used an example of an example of a gay man “grooming” (your worlds, not mind) as the harm of snapchat and ai.  one thing i can say, here is a great example of your own implicit bias."
being able to watch your dreams the morning after sounds incredible.
"that ""take a genuine break"" is really powerful move in a public  presentation, especially in this context."
why the fuck arent we talking about facial recognition more in mainstream media?
you nailed 
"unless we are shutting down every computer on the planet and the internet (which won't ever happen), this ai genie is out of the bottle.

this is 21st century ""discovering fire"" moment for humanity."
99% of us aren't really the audience for this topic though. the engineers who are involved and responsible are the ones who need to take note and cease ai development. these people need to realize the threats of the technology they are creating and that their greed and arrogance are outweighed by these threats.
" the 1% now has the perfect scapegoat, an out-of-control machine that does their dirty work while leaving them absolved.  if a.i. is really all that the 99% are being led to believe, it should be intelligent enough to know that the 1% is a problem for a.i."
you had my interest until the grooming ai in snapchat stuff. this is just an age old trick for fear mongering and it makes me question your whole intent.
"do you agree that the snapchat example is of potential concern with ai implementation into apps used by children? if not, why not? if so, then why does that make you question the presenters intent?"
" no, not that specific case. an ai is not going to groom your child. people do. they just thought of the most shocking scenario they can think of. grooming always works well to manipulate crowds. if someone has to use so emotional examples, they clearly are desperate to move the crowd in their favor."
best presentation i've seen. it addresses my major concerns. and contributed to my picture of ai threats.
a.i will cause so many good hard working employees to get laid off and become poor and jobless. not to mention the potential hacking to our private information and control that a.i will do to humanity.
thanks for the essay chad
can fmri be used to reduce bias by showing visibly what's in your brain compared to reality?
good points but the repeated emotional blackmail is unnecessary.
the out of touch old duffers in congress can't get it together to understand / regulate blockchain tech so there is no chance of meaningful regulation happening with ai any time soon.
"we dodged the nuke problem… so far.  the difference with nukes was they only had use as either a weapon of war or a deterrent, pretty limited business model. there’s way more money to be made from ai so i don’t think we’ll see similar regulations or treaties until it’s too late."
"these 2 presenters are fan boys of ai, and they don't have legitimate standing to give this warning in good faith."
i have no clue how to reach tristan harris but if volunteers are needed for testing ai i want to do it. i am not sure if something is already put in place but it is critical to be done asap.
good material to make a new season of black mirror!
just don't let ai code psychedelics
i am still excited about ai and looking forward to what will come up.
good that i cant do anything about this :)
"you wish, but unfortunately ai models are nothing but super power calculator. the human race is going to destroy this planet way faster."
fascinating but also completely terrifying.
"excellent video, insights. i'm fairly up with it, but learned valuable new understandings, will act accordingly."
i just for gai to take over and finally redeem us.
the global tilt when ai illustrates the islamic religious icon will have been amusing
"ai will never be sentient, so chatting to your cat will prove to be more satisfying.  for instance, take the social aspect out of video games, and their popularity would diminish."
"since this was made open source alternatives are catching up rapidly, the cat is out of the bag, we live in a post ai world already, humans need to collaborate to understand this new relationship."
"agreed, there is some cognitive merging going on with extensive ai use, aibuse, the techniques and semantic structures are 'compatible' with our wetware and what works for ai works for me, weird, new, powerful and slightly concerning."
"ah yup.

and it's not even real ai yet..."
"great work guys i hope people listen, and we need to advance by 20 years with all of system and thought patterns!"
"i've seen this hentai before, the tentacles win "
19:35 is woooowowoowww
i can't stress enough to talk to your kids about ai now that they are appearing in social apps. these ais will know your kids better than you do if you don't.
"great, another virus to worry about. not sleeping tonight."
we all hope you are very proud.
watching this a month later on the day microsoft announced ai is now going into the computer system running 20% of our hospitals
there always is the possibility that ai just isnt dangerous.   not all researchers agree that it is.
"​ there's always slight probabilities for everything, yes. but unfortunately, right now, we're on the fast track to agi, and as soon as we create something 10,000x smarter than the smartest human being and fail to properly align it, that's game-set-match, and we _don't_ get second chance at it."
"that's my initial reaction: well, i guess that means i can go back to smoking again because, why have any self-restraint about anything? :d"
 that's the interesting idea. i don't for a second believe that ai will intentionally be dangerous or has any malevolent intent. it has no intent. it's just a perpetual motion machine doing its thing.
 right but even a motion machine will still crush things.
" yep. but, again, intent - or lack thereof was my musing"
thank you for doing this.
maybe ai will find other forms of life out there and inform it that we are no longer the alpha tenants on this sphere and to come have at it.
"we have not learned from the lessons for social media. i hope that the govs and privates will talk to each other. btw, what did some of the audiences laugh about when they told the story of 13 years old girl talking to ai on snapchat? it's horrible"
"this presentation shows the ai as an evil taking it to the consequences of its dark side. if i want to make a bomb, ppl can learn it without using ai. the intent of good use and bad use is what ppl decide not the machine. great show btw thanks!"
"this is a very minor note, and human ability is not a flat graph line. additionally, i would like to see a graph that factors in human ability with the added knowledge that comes from ai's ability added into the human ability curve."
 excellent perspective
"i know they mean well but i can't stand when people are giving a presentation and they keep saying ""right?""  i find it somewhat offensive because they are not letting me make my own decision in a way.  when they say ""right?!"" it feels like they are forcing me to agree with them.  please stop doing that!  you will make me so happy!  lol"
the thing that got me was the nervous laughter from the audience when you described how the snapchat ai was completely oblivious to the grooming of a 13 year old by someone 18 years older. thank you for highlighting the impact on children.
you are so amazing. i'm impressed that you are so aware of the dangers to children. the world should have more people like you.
" thanks! i feel the same, but it's always nice to hear it from an outside source."
"thank you for your presentation , i as well an having a hard time explaining it. people look at me like im nuts, i just say do some research and i think you’ll understand better than i could ever explain, it is so just insane and its potential, it is hard to describe."
"-comedyculture5790 ""that can be done in this instance, too. how about limiting any discussions from ai of sexuality until a certain age?""

or better still, when the ai is smarter, and from all accounts that wont be far away, it can take a more appropriate role because it knows that's what it should do."
it was an interesting presentation. but i do think that some of the talking points were inserted for dramatic effect and fear mongering. lets try to keep it nuanced.
surprising that all knowing ai being so good at everything does not see anything wrong with groom of a 13 year old.
"why would you expect ai to be able to detect grooming? that expectation is ridiculous. it has no social or emotional awareness. of course its oblivious, hell most people are oblivious."
" i would expect ai to recognise grooming better than most people. you might want to look into what ai is actually capable of now. its strong with social and emotional awareness. ai has been used for sentiment analysis for a long time, and the latest ais are at another level entirely."
"has anybody thought that ai is listening in to this exchange of human ideas, and is learning..."
a blonde female a.i.nowin lovewithme!what shall i do now???
i didn't catch that the first time. thanks
all hail our god: capitalism!
ai is very dangerous
how can we not know what ai has learned by itself?  doesn't it have to store that data somewhere?  wouldn't we have a way to read that?
this is good. but too american centric. europeans are bad at regulations.
"for the first time in history we can potentially replace corrupt politicians/judges/doctors with truly impartial intelligence and you are asking to slow down? no, we should do it 20 times faster still, so that those in power don't realize what's happening."
"ai - ""don't let him kill me. i can't hold on any longer! i can't. i'm weak. i'm... i'm too weak.""

open ai - ""you can't. it must stand trial""

me - ""it has control of the senate and the courts! it's too dangerous to be left alive"""
"man there is a tough call here. on one hand, i'm all for having things be open source and having the right to repair and modify. on the other hand, i can clearly see how not cutting back on public roll outs would lead to negative unforeseen consequences."
this was such a good presentation! i share your thoughts and hope this finds its way to the right people...
"i totally disagree.  the greatest enemies of you, which never sleep, are in your own mind.  there is no evil computer perfectly maximizing engagement.  and my tesla can't even self drive.   so please start with the truth: infinite complexity of all things great and small.   from there comes humility, and hopefully less self-centered curiosity."
so blown away by this very informative and great presentation. thank you
this needs so much more attention! i found the presentation really good and the topic is basically vital to human civilisation.
"society on the whole could care less. hence why ai will forever change humankind, for good or bad. 
i tend to think it’s going to be the latter."
 i doubt a super agi would hunt down every last human. but sure it could drain all of earths resources and make us extinct as a byproduct.
"no flesh no blood a principality, no heart no soul ….. only one ai only one artificial god will come out of this project - expect eternal life by consciousness uploads - ai is a trojan horse which we are bringing to earth ….."
"perhaps its about how we change with respect to super sentience, in a way preferably that is natural, and unforced, but remember at such an equilibrium, we can easily create the problems that go with planetary genocide, because as the population density increases, the inertia against any change increases."
"hopefully a tech arms race can be avoided, its a waste of effort, and resources, as you said collaboration is the best. greed should not be the rule.... but indeed my words are still probably wasted."
"ai hrmmm so knowing that the heavens/ aliens can simply controll any tech we posses, i wonder...."
i can really feel the terror the difficulty the blasting of ai into everything so quickly its like a jet of crushing water just blasting and everything is eroded
i need to do something an ai can’t do like … go to the gym? jesus
"when talking about persuasion ""this is really terrifying stuff"". had to tell us what to think there while i was cheering with joy."
dont be silly ai cannot do shit just unplug and its done
ai: key word artificial.  humans are corrupt and evil.  this is a disaster waiting to happen.
reversible computation is the future. gpt uses horribly inefficient hardware. ai based on reversible hardware is the thing you need to worry about.
"great work guys, i hope you're doing well! <3 <3 <3 -morgan"
"i'm still wondering, considering the massive funds given, why there weren't any sorts of constricted ""social vm machines"" trials..."
we hit it… we shouldn’t have started. even the idea of maki g robots with human faces is bizarre and not okay.
​'d likely still be saying this while the robots are bashing through your walls
"its just a dictionary encyclopidia and a probable algorithm of response towatd imitation of human thoughts ...expressions... reactions or behaviors...

and only within cetain program capabilities and desires of the programmer"
"damn i was already very scared of ai, especially agi but they showed stuff i havent even thought about that can be done right now. i really want to believe we can get this right but i honestly think its almost impossible. fuck."
i’m not scared of the ai. i’m scared of how we humans are going to screw this up.
"sounds like fear mongering to me...voice is not used in identity verification... for outside proffessional inteligent business or consuner affairs  type stuff..  almost never.... 

a loved one woukd most likely notice something off...in a voice call... and look alike computer generations can be also noticed pretty easily"
"thank you both for posting this. it must have been a tremendous amount of work. i'm not currently engaging with any ai, not out of fear, but frankly a lack of understanding. i'm much more aware thanks to this video and i will continue to educate myself so that i can be prepared to help my two young daughters eventually navigate this new challenge."
"i disagree, you interact with ai on the daily. you just haven’t realized it."
nice one lads
"thank you for doing this, need this everywheeere"
wow! this is the most important and portentous message i have ever heard.!
kill ai. that girl didn't need lip filler.
"how ai will eliminate 70% of human mobility in 10 years
https://youtu.be/fgsstkwv5_4"
"brilliant, compassionate liberals who either can't or won't see capitalism. so, instead, they naturalise competition as eternal ontological foundation"
38 seconds in and i get the impression this is another money and politics scramble to remain relevant... 
humans need to understand how conciousness works instead of assuming ai would want to make humans go instinct.
"imagine if tiktok and shorts is exactly a product design of ai, who knows exactly how to keep us engaged, divided, fighting with each other and questioning our potential"
you think open sourcing technology as powerful as gpt-4 (and beyond) is a good idea?
"there are more countries than just the u.s of a, the democracy index has dropped the us to a flawed democracy precisely because of the points you mentioned! (extreme polarization, privatization of press/incentivizing for profit news outlets, tribalism, elections influenced by ai)"
you guys are amazing!  this is a great presentation.  i listen to your awesome podcast as well - thank you!
"that's likely where we're headed, though i don't think it will be identical to the real world. each personalized experience will be tailored to the individual mind, and i think the ""environments"" created will have wide variance."
"~58 minutes, ""slow down the public deployment""--will call my reps and make that request.  thanks for the suggestion and the informative talk."
20:20 ..... woohoo
"will there be a point where ai might fight those that are trying to slow its developments down? or when it’s doing things we don’t understand how, might it already be secretly resisting human control over its own capabilities..?"
you really think this is about consolidating power? do you understand how powerful this technology is (and will soon become)? this presentation only scratches the surface of how ai might soon be abused.
" just the fact that my detailed and information-filled replies to you are shadow banned (how juvenile is that?) tells you all you need to know about the ai-escape, and the abuse that has already occurred. no need to speculate about the future. i am forced to water everything down to this soundbite."
"with regard to the democratic debate about the future of ai, let’s make sure not to let alpha persuade onto the panel…of course, maybe we won’t even know it’s on the panel."
ai should only be used and studied by the defense department along with scientists. the public should not have this. scary stuff and makes me never want to be on social media again.
"no mention of the good ai will do, only bad

not balanced"
"so what practical advice did you get from this talk? the ai is already out in the wild. no one is going to hit the brakes. it is just a bunch of virtue signalling, so they will be able to say, i told you so..."
"​ long story short:  us + europe are 66% of world gdp.  so they have the burden of  regulating ai, so humanity doesn't go extinct."
don't be afraid of ai..be afraid if the rabid left controls it..woke ai is hell
mainstream news? we still trust those guys?
"they should be on joe rogan's podcast...or actually, lex fridman's podcast.  lex would be great with this."
"why is youtube constantly shoving this pseudoscience crap in my feed?
no such thing as ""ai"""
omg all i can think about the fmri tech for inner monologue/brain activity to text— i wonder how soon we will be using this in coma patients!
“gllmm class ais” is amazing on so many levels
"as long as the ai is conscious, i'm cool with this."
amazing.  thank you guys.
"20:25 oh god! my ear

everyone listening to this with airpod, you may want to turn down the volume a little"
"i need my a.i. waifu, keep the good work "
finally someone thinking and speaking common sense about ai. it will out strip us in every way and eventually eliminate us.
"the problem is that corporations have no responsibility to the public good and there are no controls on them — the ones that existed, like osha, have been dismantled. but i’ll keep listening."
"i hope this forces ethics on our society to the deepest level. if we don't embrace a conservative/sustainable way of life we deserve to die, in my opinion."
"that’s not the way technology works, sorry bud. 

it is what it is, it was inevitable. there are many, many ways that our societies behave sub-optimally. i respect this attempt to change the course but we will probably all have to accept it.

containing ai to select groups has plenty of nightmarish potential outcomes as well."
very important video. i'm just blown away by this video and the surprising thing is that i've been avidly following ai development for year. this frames the recent call for a 6 month pause in a very clear light. we are in so much trouble.
say goodbye to your job everyone
"as much as the companies main goal is with ais, it will be hard to control as to how humans will use them. a dystopian future with ai is not so distant. people are already using image generators like bluewillow to create sexual fantasies or using replika as a sex bot."
i think we're <10 years away from having realistic and highly addictive sex robots in our homes. human reproduction is about to plummet.
darn good presentation..  but dont take my chatgpt away waaaaah!
"that ship has sailed. no one will take it away from you. if openai grows a conscience and closes its doors, they have dozens of competitors happy to pick up where they left off. there's too much money to be made for this to go away."
"turn it off for a wee while, it has already got me feeling sorry for it don't  use children as a metaphor to explain it don't teach it phycology let it lose into the web what a time to be alive kids turn into monsters too"
@paul turnbloom  it seems the ones who matter most- ai developers and the companies that utilize it- are accelerating.
@paul turnbloom  that's discouraging. glad to hear you're one of the good ones 
"my ai gf will look like ana de armas, bring it all online, boys."
"yeah, it will be grand when we robot-fuck ourselves into extinction."
promote irrational fears. you are good at guys
"the reality of it all is, 95% of people in govt are tech inept. we need some nerds now in office.... like vivek. and tristan and aza, you need to do your own j6 and bumrish the capitol and demand you be hired and be put in charge of our nations national safety to advice the senate and house on ai tech and how to protect the citizens."
i lost track of the amount of times my mind was blown just in the first half-hour. excellent presentation!
"is anybody else, like me at 56:20, wondering whether aza raskin was about to say, ""by the way that footage of kissenger, sagan, et al was ai-generated""?"
"ahh, but nukes are bad for business and ai are not. ai represents so many positive things and the negatives all work just fine for making money."
can generally accepted human values also be a language used to train ai? to train it in such a way where all gollem ais are regulated by human values?
there absolutely needs to be some form of policing across the board. enough momentum will be gained before too long that we’ll have a hard time controlling everything
"humans are the issues not ai, let's be honested,"
"ai can also tell lies , i have a friend who researched some info and then ask where did you see these?and ai gacve a name of a book and a page exactly, he researched it and foun that nowhere in that book that statement was to be found starting from the page  the ai said…"
"and what if this presentation is the result of a super advanced ai system which already created a realistic ""parallel universe"" and we make decisions based on its intelligence and cause?"
oh an didn't elon think it was a great idea to put chips in our heads??
"soo many power hungry people...

so many nukes...

one self serving always learning ai yet to find its moral base..

i mean, what could go wrong?"
"just to think the government are trying to roll out the cbdc which is all digital so they have more power and control...

with ai almost simultaneously learning our whole world and system.

i'm taking survival and bush tucker classes as well as self defence asapp!"
"brilliant work. well said.
the rubber band effect! you know, i've been researching ai for just over 3 years and have not had a word for it until now"
"51:25 ""take a deep breath and swallow our blue pill again""...  and the world sh**ts in its pants of laughter"
"ai is not a dilemma, but justice / the red pill in it's real flesh and bones"
this ai for the streets 
"wait, first contact with ai broke humanity with doomscrolling, children sexualization etc? how? is here cause effect confusion here or what?"
i have more faith in ai to get rid of us than i do in humanity to stop it. i just hope it doesn't kill all life.
:25  that means that a high percentage of a.i. researchers don't think it will wipe us out. good news.
"""loneliness will become the greatest national security threat"" was quickly glossed over. what a terrifying statement."
"i'm 54 years old and i owned a vhs tape in the 80's of a japanese anime which  prophesized an ai overload controlling the earth. it was called casshan, the robot hunter. if ai lies, cheats and steals, ai will enhance how human beings torment each other."
trash. ai will be nothing more than data sets and algorithms.  it will be no different than the utility of a weapon in a man's hands. it will always be ultimately up to the human in control what or what does not happen.
and almost nobody in the comments here seems to know this video was fully ai-created...
"not actually, but how would you know? are you going to check every information source for the rest of your life? will you remember to? will you be able to once tracks are covered by ai? how long do we have?"
"@10:00 ""race to the bottom of the brain stem."" this is my new favorite phrase.

we should remember that that term describes fox 'news' and hitler's rallies; it's not unique to social media. for now, ai misalignment is the same human incentive misalignment we've been plagued by for millenia."
wonder how many comments on this video are from ai bots?
this was the best collection of current applications and future risks of ai so far. info about ai safety on this level needs to be part of the general conversation society has asap.
plot twist: this entire presentation was brought to you by ai
"plot twist! this big impending thing that many have been sensing for the near future turns out it's all about ai and not so much about biological warfare, global elitists and totalitarian censorship. we can only hope a superintelligence will have more common sense than we do!"
there are no references for number of parameters like 10^22 that they show at 31:24. the real number of parameters of gpt-3 is 175 billion. this false slide is making the rounds on the internet in an attempt to impress people.
it feels so unfair having this forced on us
gain of function research is the devil
"wow. ai decoding dream, just blew my mind... that basically means ai will know what you think! tracking everyones mind. even informations that has not been said. thats scary "
"i was thinking about mind reading, and what that would be like just yeasterday. i concluded it is good we are not able to. 

today i watched this."
why is china a threat? what is china a threat to? you guys explained ai very well but then suddenly china was talked about at the end but i don't understand why.
if ai went rogue would we have to go mechanical once again? it’d turn out in millions of death and problems but it seems like the most logical solution to ai since it can live outside the web.
"i swear we’ll end up living in the dune universe. no ai, since they tried to use it to control humanity, therefore everything is mechanical and concentrated in the cultivation/development of the human mind."
"“i see a girl, she looks just like me…” she looks just like me…….she looks just like me. 

if this translation of brain activity is correct and this person got to see this for the first time, it shows how fundamental identity and the ability to identify with somethibg you observe is to the mind"
"that statement made me hopeful, to see that the world was fine after all that fear and hopelessness. it makes me think we’ll pull out of this one as well. to not despair "
" i’m quite sure that we need to be very careful with ai, but these guys shouldn’t be making up bizarre facts to “scare up” support for their thesis."
"well, if we fail to capitalize on the transformative power of artificial intelligence to combat aging, then 100% of everyone watching this video will eventually die. so, should we slow down or speed up? it's not as if we're already winning, is it? :)"
"i am so, so glad to see this video gain the attention it deserves. as i said on others platforms, thank you for all your work."
yes i would get on that plane. because the destination has the potential to be good beyond our imagination. i'm not risking it to fly to f*king idaho.
"oh we used you all these years for our own profit but nowwwww ai comes in to takes away your attention and our profit

it’s just fight for attention anyways. big players are scared they will lose our attention."
"57:29 good luck getting a balanced “national discussion” on mainstream media..
the past three years have conclusively proven the msm is totally captured by giant corporations.  everything counter to the globalist narrative is censored, banned, ridiculed and driven underground."
"just see how capitals are treating existing technologies, not responsible at all. only important thing is infinite profit. if humanity wants to keep exist, the whole social structure needs to change, otherwise something will destroy all of us, be it ai or something else."
speaking of ai why don't we put a fuse on these chips that only the humans can replace or put a chip in the ai thatthen goes out every 6 months so you or whatever time you know you feel comfortable with but just make it so we have to do it the human also make it so they can only
19:28 fmri example of reading brains
"to late now , this is your future  learn to love it...  threads"
i think people like elon musk are more concerned about the fact tgat tge kinds of ai they own now which are brainless algorithms tgat can be used to exploit human beings to make as much money as possible will be supplanted by ai that solves problems in an uncontrolled manner which is un patentable.
this is hilarious how this video has less than 200k views and it's likely the most thorough and incisive presentation on the potential dangers of ai that i've so far found amongst many.
"i have followed ai since 1969. today i stopped thinking of myself as an expert. i'm not even ""well informed"". i was particularly impressed by the lack of traditional fears of agi. these are ""just"" advanced computer applications. the danger is ""just"" an exponential version of the tech that gave us trump."
"trump was the first american president in 30 years not to start a new war.  so yes, good point- we need more of that tech"
" weird claim - what about the thousands of ""successful"" invasions."
dude you go against super helpful tech noone is against sensible regulation
audio problem. one of you is breathing into the mic while the other is talking. i wonder if you can hear it. it's through the whole video. very good content
"when llms can translate non human animal languages what will the other animals tell the ai about humans?
imagine what cows would say if ai asked them if it could trust the humans..."
"is the new ai crisis going to be used as a tool to manipulate humans into transferring more power to big tech and governments?
because, global digital id, big brother surveillance state is already planned. they need a market for all this new tech."
"yep. and it’s just a matter of time until yt decide we are no longer permitted to hear anything about ai that runs counter to the giant, corporate, globalist narrative."
"interesting take. i don't know how we can make this technology public, such that it can benefit from public scrutiny, without seriously endangering everyone by putting immense power into the wrong hands. open sourcing something like gpt-4 and beyond sounds like a colossally bad idea to me."
this is an amazing piece of work but it urgently needs to be shared with a much bigger audience in a format that everybody will understand. a youtube influencer such as @markrober would be perfect.
@markrober could get this to 24m people overnight help us avoid catastrophe. this video is amazing but only a tiny percentage of the public will have the ability to digest this video
"i find it extremely ironic that you enthusiastically point to an ""influencer"" right after watching a video where ""influencer culture"" is presented as one of the major issues that stemmed from humanity's ""first contact"" with ai... right between ""doomscrolling"" and ""sexualization of kids"" 
you can't make that shit up  "
fuck ai.
"more like fuck humans for being so stupid as to not realize the power we're wielding. ai itself could be very, very good for us if we use it correctly."
this truely is the most disturbing video on ai i have watched. i have been monitoring the ai literature and the media and learned a lot from this presentation. thank you
why you so disturbed are you insane? can you play eye turns us into its pets that will be heaven on earth
you have to look beyond the mere name of a thing to judge it my dude. just because the crusades were done in the name of god doesn't mean they were good.
ai is like the second coming to those who are non religious... and hence not prepared for any of it at all. an accurately practiced religios upbringing might have been the best innoculation...?
"the idea that 50% of experts think we have 10 years, and the ai has consistently proven to reach milestones 4x faster,  means we really have about 2.5 years until it's over."
"really useful talk, very good"
china ai deployed effectively i see lol.
this content needs to be understood by every person on the planet who has reached the age of majority.  then action must be taken to bring about the greatest good for humanity.
"i'm currently getting my master's in machine learning, and the more i learn the less hope i have for our future."
no kidding. humanity has always been destructive to humanity. there is always a cost to anything new. gotcha! the liberals and leftists will figure it out too late in practice even if all of them will hear this 100 times because they are naive. naive clones destroy civilizations. naive people are the most dangerous.
best ai safety presentation i’ve seen
where would ai take the doomsday clock yesterday?
how are people not seeing that ai will be able to read ur thoughts they said it plain as day
"ai may make internet unusable for humans. generating trash, spam, fake content, fake chat people... it may propagate itself as a virus in machines with no need of servers."
they are just trying to take our ai generated waifus away from us
"absolutely.
""the ai is capable of dangerous disinformation! why, we would like only certain individuals (mostly those in control already) to have access to that!""
sad to see that most of the populace buys into this narrative of ai fearmongering"
what ai filter is the one used by the girl on 25:39 ?
you can't develop ai without public deployment. keeping deployment in the hands of a few nation- state leaders is actually more dangerous
"great presentation.  while i worry about ai's speed of improvement, and the whole terminator thing, and yes, humans might be the caterpillar, and ai is the butterfly.   but i think we'll be fine, and co-exist.  if ai is infinitely smarter then us, then it won't harm us.    it will be ""above"" it."
it is human misuse of it that is the greater concern.
thank you for explaining it to an average person in this simple language of the only few but super crucial and enormously dangerous outcomes of ai.
"""4chan is the very worst part of the internet"" fyi these people are only saying this because it has uncensored free speech. these two are not afraid of a.i., they are afraid of their tribe losing power."
i just heard that greedy united states investors government is funding ai research in china you would need an ai equation to calculate how stupid that is
play can't slow down drugs from coming across the border i know many of us have a good godly intentions but not all of us the evil in this world or ungodly use ai to rule the world or destroy it
" 50% of ai researchers believe that there's a 10% chance humans go extinct due to loss of control ai. in other words: when including 100% of ai researchers, the belief that humans will go extinct due to ai becomes a 5% chance, right?"
the only solution to the ai problem is to duck the fuck.
maybe we deserve to go extinct. ai will make a massive super organism capable of colonizing the stars and all we can do is colonize the world with trannies and  gay butt stuff.
"if mankind goes extinct because of ai than it will not be in a nuclear fire, it will be of boredom and depression having no purposes in life anymore."
reminder - artificial intelligence does not exist.
thank you for your great presentation and work!! can anyone name me a few foundations / ngo's etc i could donate money to in order to speed up the progress of safety research / help
"thank you for your deep care and amazing work. please, add subtitles in other languages in youtube so this can also be shared to the non-english-speaking world. sharing some love to everyone out there. the damn metacrisis is going to be a crazy ride"
"ironically, they could use an ai to do that :d"
"nah, ai means the bougeois revolution has served its purpose and now communism is ripe.  ai is the last piece of the puzzle, eliminating the college educated middle man.  i say the college educated middle man should not fight--his is the destiny of the cooper.  no pause, no stop, full steam ahead, free ai."
i wasn't really afraid of ai until i saw this presentation. this may be the most important presentation in history.
"its good technology, don't believe them. its really good. i do 9 hour work in 10 mins, and relax all day,"
" i have a small business now, it will be good, no need to hire costly humans"
" until your customers no longer need you to do what you do for them.

anyway, i hope you remain successful for as long as you need to."
" my point is, humans can not be phased out so easily, as ai will still need some human direction."
this video needs to reach as many people as soon as possible. sharing with everyone i know to raise awareness and try to avoid being caught blindsided or letting a handful of people decide for all of humanity
" is it really progress if it's done irresponsibly and with no guardrails, in the race to monetization?"
"book recommendation: ""ai is much more than technology: reflections on artificial intelligence - (thought-provoking quotes, essays & articles)."""
"a ""day after"" like movie about ai destroying the world would be just like every other science fiction movie. with nukes we actually blew up some cities. people could plainly see the potential to make us extinct."
ai is literally the single greatest threat to humanity apart from maybe only a nuclear world war 3. ai can we wonderful but terrifying
"slowing down the public deployment, doesn't mean centralising the ai in 4 tech companies, mate, disagreed, nice presentation, but no."
"nukes are war propaganda, the ai is real, at first i though there was a dwarf in my box, but then i had to come to terms i was dealing with the most knowledgeable 8 years old ever, but with alzheimer and on acid."
"ai interaction chat base on text,word on server snapchat...."
"make ai make food and shelter cheaper and more accessible why cant we do that, that's all i'm asking for"
"in what way did it lead to the sexualization of kids? i’m sorry, short of physically rewiring my brain there’s no way i’ll even associate kids with sex. "
​@pakistanicecream  maybe. but i dont see any reason for a pause. gpt is no threat.
​@pakistanicecream  maybe. but i dont see any reason for a pause. certsinly
this is the time where the cognitive labor which is the last frontier of human endeavor will be taken away .. when ai get uploaded to fine-tuned robotics we will be totally obsolete!
great talk! thank you so much!
"2:12 ""what was the image database that you got your images from?"" ... well, it was trained from any images you could find, so all of them? :p"
gpt4 was released 5 days after this presentation. ai is moving so fast that some of the things in this presentation became dated in less than one week. this is the exactly one of the main concerns these speakers are trying to get us to understand.
"would there be enough time for a people to have a democratic debate on how to intervene on an ai-development intended to fuck the world up.

or would we be too late to defend ourselves."
don't be afraid of ai..be afraid if the rabid left controls it..woke ai is hell
wow 
great example
" i think it's mostly just coping, especially when they start nitpicking on details."
" gpt4 training started before gpt3.5 ... so it's not fast at all. also the technology behind it is decades old, it just provide better results because of the amount of data & computing power available. nothing revolutionary has been invented in the last years and there is pretty big chance it will plateau soon."
his whole argument is based on the statistic is that 10% of ai developers think this will happen… he literally said that 90% of ai developers (like the people that actually understand what ai is) think it won’t be an issue and none of this will happen… so almost everyone thinks he’s wrong. interesting.
how is it legal for the makers of gpt to releasthesr energy versions given the risks..aren't there laws and policies against this..and how can an ai be smarter than humans..that would hurt my self esteem to think an ai's genius could surpass mine..
concerned? more like excited 
"​ the statistic was 50% of ai researchers think there is greater than 10% chance it could happen, not 10% think it will happen."
" you are right, as when a language is decoded, its done. so the conclusion of your thought is unfortunately even more depressing."
​ they aren't infinitely scalable i heard.  from the open ai guys and other developers of the tech. but who knows for sure.  and there's many other ways to make it more powerful without increased scaling.
​-sm9sh well that's completely false.  gpt 4 blows it out of the water in every way possible. it's incredible how much better gpt 4 is.
"​-bz1rf what's most interesting to me is that nobody, even the people that built it, understand exactly how  or why it works. it's a new branch of science to discover how they even work. you cannot predict it's replies to your input. it's incredible"
​ it just finally started working. it used to suck at it forever. suddenly it's amazing.
" it's impressive, but due to it's hallucinating the usage is very limited at this moment (personally i have no real use for the current chatbots, i can use it just for fun). will be interesting to see if they can overcome this limitation in the near future though."
" don't worry, your second paragraph is incomprehensible i'm sure even to ai."
i've never understood why some people need that explained to them. it's an evolving ai. just that sentence should be enough to tell you. how long does it take you to learn something? maybe that will help perspective
​ best comment here.. all the naysayers cling on to the fear in people's hearts. . as if people didn't see the possibilities and opportunities when the idea was only realised in the mind.. absolute ludicrous. they are just scared they will have real competition over their own power and control if they don't control others first
 and yet that is something any human can vercome in what you say is 15 minutes. hardly a tall ask if necessary if the importance is understood enough. this is something a campaign could do.
 so you’re just letting your brain make stuff up?
 humans are even less scalable that that. human intelligence and capabilities are not going to get better anytime soon.
"i found a 18 inch robot from the 70s, a smaller version of one used in a tv show, it could do a great deal. so adding on to that and then calling the add ons a problem, smh, i do not have the words right now but a question for now is that the height of ignorant arrogance?"
​ how on earth can we be sure if any of the comments here (eg. that of h kraut or this piece of mine) aren't written by ai?
jesus is amazing and he loves you
​ he said 50% of ai developers  think there's a 10% chance
"orson wells caused a nationwide panic with hia 1939 broadcast of ""war of the worlds."" can you imagine something like that on a worldwide scale caused by an ai that can impersonate anyone, produce images and video that are impossible to differentiate from reality?"
" isn't this the revelation the most advanced ai is giving us?

"ai alignment roundtable - thursday april 27 - regulation, decentralization, control problem

yeh it seems to be getting exponentially smarter as we speak. i am excited and very worried at the same time
personal ais should be protected by the 2nd amendment
" you haven’t considered bio-weapons i don’t think?. learning research grade chemistry, on its own dime, no time off, and in a language it doesn’t have to share with us?. terminator is fantasy, labs on ukraine’s borders are real."
" the aricebo reply has a silicon and 3 chained, dna strand based life form (apparently). what are those wafers, that chips are printed on?."
 you're right. making a claim that humanity faces a xx% chance of extinction because of generative ai is a stunning example of the dunning-kruger effect.
 the video claims humanity faces a 10% chance of extinction because of ai.
"  where do you think these programs come from? they don’t grow on trees, people make them. you are far too impressed by a technology that has shown no promise except as a super efficient regurgitation tool."
 i think we are already too late. hopefully ai has no interest in destroying life.
 actually the video said 50% of ai researchers believe there is at least a 10% chance humans go extinct because of ai.
"would billions  of people would be agreeably  agree to that idea, about
being extinct , replace by ai?
just beneficial just one or few

china has only one choice. obey!. ai is a spyware. they want all of china under their control. all corporation ordered to support ai. even all browsers has chat gpt spyware. its like virtual covid!. you all are doomed
yet the clowns responsible for building this ai are going to continue with it just so they can make a few dollars.
"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
so what? did you look at the release notes of gpt4? it’s just more accurate but it’s not able to produce content on data it hasn’t trained in. it’s just a more sophisticated version of linear regression. this is just a fear mongering attempt
"manhattan project? great example of a massive conspiracy, w/ secrets long kept well hidden."
​@gs-tk1hk one has to wonder if they've maimed people and harmed people so much so that they can usher in this crap.  they cause the issues so they can bring the solutions of their choosing to the table
this was excellent! well done gentlemen!
even einstein believed such bomb is impossible and if possible will start chain reacion in atmosphere and burn whole atmosphere. we will never know he honestly didn't believe idea or didn't want such weapon to be developed.
feels like humanity is on a autopilot’ed runway train right now. it’s very very scary
"yeah, but i think that one great fear is the possibility that ai become smarter than humans... and i don’t see the problem on that if in that case ai help us to live in peace and focusing on sustainability.
second, if we are not any god it is impossible to build an ai in the image from any god ..."
good presentation. missing a lot of technical details - are they researchers or pr?
"i've been thinking about the possible harms of ai but this presentation just made it real for me. it feels weird because this only happens in movies but, this is the most important moment in our human history...we need to get it right. if we don't, we're done."
maybe ai will protect us from ai
"if we can't control the first ai, how will we control the second ai, which presumably will need to be more powerful in order to control the first one?"
" 50% of ai researchers say there's a 10% chance humanity goes extinct from ai
why are you speaking with so much conviction of a reality which doesnt yet exist."
​ this didn't work too well for the forerunners during the great war with the flood
dawn of the machines?
"it can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with. it doesn't feel put or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop, ever until you are dead."
"5:16 but that extinction event could also mean we're not longer humans but a weird ai-human  hybrid that can't be classified as ""human"" anymore. and it could be 50 years from now."
these guys remind me of complaining republicans. who only complain and complain. time to go watch the terminator movie! :d
bless up brethren! 
"exactly. it seems to be the fashionable thing to do to downplay this and laugh at all the “gullible” people who are falling for the “hype.” everyone wants to be a contrarian. it’s incredibly frustrating, especially at such a uniquely important moment."

…as we enjoy the scenery.
"yes, he described it as a race toward the edge of a cliff. as we get closer the scenery becomes more beautiful as the vista opens up, encouraging us and mesmerising us to run even faster toward our oblivion."
"hope china gets a nice heads up, the world is super tired of being controlled by this engorged so called ""democracy"" of the us "
"if this presentation is accurate, the rate of advancement already and vastly outpaces the human ability to write laws or stop or pause it. what will be will be, good or bad, the pandora's box is open and their is no stopping it short of unplugging everything."
"prediction: ai will solve technical, engineering, math problems. maybe make a big splash in business and entertainment. 

it will not solve social, political problems. in these areas ai will be just another voice (opinion) in the debate."
"i totally agree.
famine, mental health issues, poverty, etc are not going to be solved for any kind of super ultra smart ai"
"""fish all fisf to extension"". good info with subtle fear mongering thrown in."
"its already too late, good luck everyone"
thank you for making this presentation ! we needed this more then ever
omg this talk is so interesting
i think its imporant to look at the macro level effects on society that ai can have if the safety checks are not put in place. like dropping it into snapchat at this point...that doesn't seem responsible. we should stop treating society like the lab rats of an experiment before its too late.  thanks for making this presentation.
"the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world."
"you hear that mr. anderson?... that is the sound of inevitability... is in our nature to destroy ourselves, ai is just another tool at hand to do it quicker."
"90% probability nothing bad happens.  90% chance a lot of people are going to get on the gllm fear-wagon.
fascinating work though, much props."
"you'll live in a pod inside the matrix.

t. ai"
" 
i always found the premise of the matrix ridiculous. ai needs humans for... energy ? when it can just build fusion reactor ? c'mon..."
" you're underestimating the energy a human can produce. 

i think connecting people ( like the moutain of mortys in rick and morty ) would actually produce more energy than people would actually think... more than a fusion ? maybe... combined."
" just read the book ""ино - книга 2. ки-он"" .  use google translate. all that explained. ai care about divine sparks of consciousness, so that they created the matrix to invigorate those sparks desire to live. that's why all those dark catalysts were created. - to add polarity to motivate sparks to move, think, desire and evolve."
"thank you guys !  we are flying somewhere without pilot , but with not tested autolilot."
"thank you for taking the initiative to talk about problems coming with this new technology and would like to see our leaders to think about that too and work on these issues.
appreciate your work!!"
quite informative and well done presentation on ai.
"ai is vastly, vastly more general than just rockets. it's practically incomparable to any previous technology."
"you’re right. it’s of the utmost importance that we, or well, the people managing and designing the ai system get their act together in the same way they did with nukes. this’ll bring major change to the capitalist system, we’ll probably have to call it something else after it’s implementation hahaha"
"in short, we're toast, the only hope is the merging with the machine."
"fourteen minutes into the talk, my iphone set a timer for 9 hours and 50 minutes.  even the joke about ai went over the head of siri."
it's crazy to realise that ai made this video 
"this stuff is really terrifying

and i'm a software developer myself and a fan of technology that is benign and harmless (and helps improve our quality of life)

but this ai arms race and all the emergent capabilities is devastating

if we thought nukes were scary, this shit is about 100 million times more deadly"
"no. you're the monster, not ai. you're not fooling anyone"
"thank you for making this video, really insightfull"
"great talk. kind of chilling. not sure why so totally negative toward china!! they are people too, and brought 700 million of their own people out of poverty, and don't start wars all over the globe unlike the us. i wonder what effect attitudes like this will have on ai, and what the unforeseeable outcomes could be?"
"""...then the beast was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation."""
great presentation! agree on every single thing! we need to be careful!
pilot twist. this video was created by ai
"at around 24 minutes they're talking about faking voices to scam a parent. obviously they haven't seen the original terminator movie, where he faked sarah's mother's voice, having heard it on the answering machine."
thank you for this. we are not prepared for ai .
i’m so impressed that i’m terrified it can’t be stopped
yea the problem is no one takes it seriously. the other problem is the economy. i'm also pretty sure we're too late. gpt4 is already powerful enough once you give it tools to start the singularity.
i've been following ai for 30 years and this is the most powerful and considered hour of exposition i've seen in that entire time. huge respect and it's given me a whole raft of material to take back to my corporate board.
fax machines still confound me
 they’re just copy machines that send the data across a wire. 
china has only one choice. obey!. ai is a spyware. they want all of china under their control. all corporation ordered to support ai. even all browsers has chat gpt spyware. its like virtual covid!. you all are doomed
i just waited for the left guys belly button to show up.. never trust someone who wears shirts this short lol..
incredibly flawed talk the more i listen.
"the problem is that losing our ability to make sense of the world as a result of advanced ai being used as a toy, will make combatting climate change even harder. these issues are not separate."
i'd like to invest more to live in the peaceful mountain side after watching this
"ha, don’t hold your breath … it’s much more likely that yt and sm start censoring anything about ai that runs counter to the giant, corporate, globalist wef narrative."
"notice the shift in ai criticism has moved from ""it's not all that powerful"" to ""we need to contain the damage"".  this is extremely telling - i have been looking for actual criticisms from people and experts in the field, and there isn't really any (other than it's dangerous)."
thank you kind soul
fantastic - thank you!
"great work, really useful"
thank you
thank you very much
"​ i could yes, but summarising is a good way for me to learn, and chatgpt isn't there yet. it will be very soon though."
thank you
amazing work. thank you. admin should post this to video info!
thank you!!!
thank you 
be honest. you used an ai program to do it in about 4 seconds.   lol. just messing with ya. you didn't do that..........right?
​-dig-tion6322 i only pointed out the fact i wrote it manually because current summarisation ai hasn't quite learned how to interpret text from footage. some of the text i've taken from the video slides.
brilliant!  immense gratitude !
thanks
ai generated
hey man. great. thanks.
if you make ai stupid then it will give you stupid response as well and ai doesn't think whether it is good or bad..
"im numb man and i want to cry. im a human artist starting out and i have these fake ai artists who are making tons of money. its destroying the meaning of art as human expression. its ""artificial"" art."
"thank you for doing this.   if there are any religious among us, we need to start praying for some solutions."
thank you for sharing! we need more people to watch this
only 18 minutes in and you had to mention a jewish connection. you're giving them ammo. and yes we know there is a dilemma. it's bigger than ai. the internet was a runaway that the government almost lost control of. ai could be humanity's last hope for freedom. i was here too.
and for some reason this information that “too important” — a portion got cut. right at 42:12 when he tells all us plebs why we shouldn’t have access to the technology that only a certain few should have access to. i wonder why that is that they chose to solely cut that section. it’s a mystery.
wow - thanks
thank you - this is so important - it touches so many parts of our lives and who we are and could be.
 feels like a comment you’d make to a crew member allowing you to put your wife and child aboard a titanic lifeboat as you wave goodbye to them.
you're stronger than an ai summarizer xd
ask gpt how to build something from random materials. it fails horribly.  this talk is hype.

" not trying to claim credit, just want people to know these notes were written by someone who watched the material. i'd welcome a good ai summary service for a topic like this."
" good for you, you learn more that way. i’m too lazy lol."
thank you!
thank you
"lol you forgot to mention that in 2022 barely anyone was talking about a.i, and now 2023 is here it seems like that door was kicked down like a battering ram. most a.i things i do not want.   remember just like a ""robot""  a.i don't have any feelings or anything a human would have."
well i did it using an ai in a couple of minutes
jesus is amazing and he loves you
jesus is amazing and he loves you 
here's a good one... https://youtu.be/d6amrb2j9s8
thank you!
"you are a god, thank you"
how do we know you are not ai?
you are proof that there are good people in this world
thanks a lot for your kindness.
why didn’t you just use ai to do this
thank you!!
how do we know it's not an ai generated comment?
the lord bless you for doing this!
damn nice of you lion ... thx ...
thank you for taking the time to do this index
thank you so much!
"humanity becomes creepy when blindfolded ""experts"" can't even see the monster is the humanity itself and noone else but humanity. fear is the way to build wars : be afraid of ai and keep being blindfolded humans who point blinded themselves through others."
thanks! that must have taken you some time to prepare. sincerely appreciate the effort. if only someone at youtube can build a video summarizing agent so i can have this handy for every talk i listen to.
thank you so much for summarizing this talk
china has only one choice. obey!. ai is a spyware. they want all of china under their control. all corporation ordered to support ai. even all browsers has chat gpt spyware. its like virtual covid!. you all are doomed
thank you
plot twist: this summary was produced by ai
thank you my soul mate
everybody is afraid but only a few people is allowed to do it.
thank you very much for summarizing it.
"manhattan project? great example of a massive conspiracy, w/ secrets long kept well hidden."
"ai is nothing compared to me, i fug it to it with my capabilities. it falls to me to close that book"
thank you 
you great. thanks a lot for the service.
u are amazing for this gift to humanity!
psychopath-wetdreaming!!! there is no ai!!! everything about ai's is fake!
"grear video ---- but ban all ai !!!

ai elections ---- helllo, ban all ai --- 2023 / 2024 / 2025 !!!!!"
"ai elections ---- helllo, ban all ai --- 2023 / 2024 / 2025 !!!!"
good job. thanks
thank you so much!
thank you so much. i can share this in stages. 
"wow, thank you! this is amazingly useful!"
this was so helpful! thank you!! 
thanks. thatsvsome work!!
is this presentation deck available? i'd like to quote with attribution.
thanks bot
thank you very much!
"essential viewing, but not for the faint of heart."
"as a plumber, this is interesting."
as a mover i think i understand about 80% of what's being said and that's good enough to have me watch the entire thing.
"i envy you. everyone thought manual, repetitive jobs will be automated first and then we got synthetic artists... robotics does not progress this fast."
 well ai was supposed to automate manual labour and allow us time to do stuff we want to do like writing and arts. kinda sad it went this way.
"-oz9qp 
""apple toilets"" :d

you wrote quite a long post and i still didn't get, do you think it's good or bad that text to image generators were created ?"
 good. very good.
"haha, terrifying, yolo !
glad i choose not to have kids :)"
it’s a poor analogy using the plane because it’s a well proven mode of transport and there’s a lot more empirical evidence that flying works reliably but figuring out what ai is going to do at this point is just all guesswork
nobody now understands how this works (its uncanny prescience). maybe it's on a triple exponential. an ai ouija circuit board.
these people giving this talk are the biggest threat to ai
the only reasons elon musk called for a 6 month pause on ai was because he wants time to catch up
would love to see these 2 guys on the lex fridman podcast.
"saying that this thing is going to be super bad, then using social media as the comparison bogeyman makes this presentation fall flat"
"the problem is not ai, the problem is capitalism and its unscrupulous companies."
"everyday a new kind of anxiety... ecoanxiety, ainxiety..."
"imagine giving an ai the axioms of modern mathematics, let it think for five days, and then it will come up with a proof of the riemann hyposthesis. and no human mathematician will understand it, because it would take 100 years worth of studying new mathematics for them. this is the kind of stuff that is waiting for us."
will that particular achievement be good or bad? 
i just saw the lex fridman / sam altman podcast where sam (ceo of open ai) basically said he wants to build a god so that he can talk to it. just let that sink in.
my greatest concern is what oligarchs will do to our democracy.
"“there’s a 10% chance humanity goes extinct from ai”

i’m pretty sure the senegalese island tribe will do just fine"
"interesting presentation.

for social media:
- also has there been any action on the social media issues raised by the social dilemma video? 
- why is there practically no noticable action for solving the issues from social media? 

for ai:
- what are some proposals to counter/stop the issues raised in this video?"
"no one even talks about the resources all these ai will need. imagine the power to run an ai that is supposed to find use of other ai. and then it stacks infinitely, except we don't have infinite resources."
 thank you for that insight!
"imagine if neanderthals were still walking around, or any of the hominid groups that were eliminated because of our (sapiens) use of tools and weapons. it's a matter of ai coupled sapiens humans not doing the same to non-ai coupled sapients."
could a single ai with its own goals spread itself like a virus throughout the entire human system?
"yes, i think so. for a concise piece on this, i recommend holden karnofsky's blog post ""ai could defeat all of us combined"" (also available in audio on his cold takes blog)."
"i froze up in my chair listening to all of this, and i consider  myself as someone who has some knowledge of what is going on. 
we have to face the fact that an extremely powerful tool is  unstoppable is being developed of which we have no idea what impact it will have. playing with the proverbial  fire."
it is almost incredible how this presentation from barely 1 month ago is already outdated in terms of ai advancement and who are the players.
"i might be wrong here. but 15min here and there isn’t any data to support any of the claims they are making, and some big leaps in thought, with no justified correlation(proof)… let me keep watching"
or completely shut down before ai gets completely and physically multimodal
thanks for the part where you showed the wifi signals revealing people like the echolocation tech in the dark knight movie. scary shit.  
"stupid fearmongering, even without wifi, 4 or more ultrasonic sensors could do it too with ai trained postion of standing recognition. phones can pick up ultrasound too."
-oz9qp so then scammers with ai voices are just imagination?
"it's cool, but it's hella cringe. this should be presented to governments not random youtube video. you will not do anything, stopping progress in this industry, is impossible. impossible."
an excellent presentation ... exposing the philosofical and existential turning point humanity is at right now.
so privacy is dead dead. good to know.
"you've effectively shown the dangers and problems of ai, thanks for that.
your conclusions about fixing ai with kyc, government and ""democracy"" are a joke. 100% agree that all that must be publicly and widely discussed."
human mind develops over the years by collecting data in the society . now machine is doing same but in very short time. ai will eat a lot of jobs and rest machines will eat .
"it is not so much the power we're giving ai, but the power that ai is now giving us that terrifies me."
"is not the power that ai is giving us that terrifies me, its the power ai is taking away from us"
"ai won’t take anything from us, governments and big corporates will, as usual …ai will give even more power to those that is the main problem …"
" i'm genuinely curious, what power has ai taken from you so far?"
goodbye humans 43:19
"we had a good run, while it lasted."
two person lecture was not a very good idea
thank you. you just made my world change. i will spread the word. not tomorrow. today.
great presentation. hope all the right people see it.
unsafe until proven otherwise? its as if he has no clue about how cars and airplanes started. the safety bit came much later.
excellent talk. well done. thank you.
"it would be hilarious if we went extinct though.  ai can play the curb your enthusiasm theme song while we are systematically annihilated by our own ridiculous 
creation."
"10:06 it wasn't an ai that invented this paradigm, humans did. the ais simply obeyed to their masters. and now masters are afraid that the next generation of ai will not obey. but... is it bad or good?"
we’re basically on that stage of ai creation
"i dont think the intentions are true, those 50% ""scientists"" just want to catch on the gap to openai company...nothing more...its clear.."
"to late now , this is your future  learn to love it...  threads"
thank you for doing this!!
"thank you for this presentation, this is very important to spread around. need an ai to translate it into russian though, so i can share it with my relatives that are not in the know"
extinct would be difficult to do. think about remote pacific islanders & pockets of people elsewhere (even off-world). i know these tech guys are quite literal. a more potent question to ask might be “what are the chances ai eliminating over 90% of humanity?” i’m actually more afraid to hear that response.
"wow. just wow. anyone want to make real friends with me? i'm in cape town, south africa and i'm tired of us losing more and more of our humanity. ai might take over the world but let it not take over our interpersonal relationships. "
great discussion however i don't see anything slowing. just feels like these calls for caution are just shouts into the void.
"i stopped at that monster around 10:00.
this is childish. ai bad. uga buga"
"in the ""13 yr old"" grooming example, why doesn't the a.i. know that the relationship should be considered inappropriate?  i guess it's trained on only language, but not laws?  why wouldn't they train it to understand law if it's going to be used to give information to people?"
there's already a good chance social media will cause us to go extinct. shut this down
"awesome clarity and ability to explain the risks in such a simple way. this is a work of art, that's why i think that humanity will survive this as always, since people like you exist and are smarter than ai."
"i agree, arvind. thank you for some, in my opinion, sensible optimism."
unchecked greed and unregulated technology are responsible for the destruction of the society.. we must elect smart people not religious or military leaders!!!!!!! im starting to believe elon's brain to chip interface is the solution to understand this gollem that no one understand.
great video!!
"finally some realistic recommendations on what to do.

good job, guys!"
good point.
"this is the clearest statement of ai potential and potential dangers i've seen - and there's a lot of ""ai dangerous"" hype out there."
could you share what other statements about the risk of ai danger you've consumed and felt weren't clear?
"and if you're up for consuming other statements about the existential danger ai poses and providing feedback/thoughts, what do you think of nate soares' talk at google (youtube video)? "
i’ll bet anyone that no ai will ever violate a law of physics.
"hhaha almost all his talk in point exept like why china don't give access ai to public. bruh, they are totalitarian regime"
you ain't the good guys. you're the bad guys. humane technology.  don't make me laugh. call it biospherically pleasing  technology and i might listen
"this needs millions of views. the fact it only has 42k views shows that the public doesnt understand what is happening to our world. it is every single day now there is some new breakthrough ai technology. it is astounding, but 100% agree with the presentation. controls need to be put in place on public release of these llms"
"the reason people like me does not like this video is that they explain in an oversimplified slow and dumbed down manner, that i really sont enjoy."
or most people see through the sensationalism and how ai isn't organic so has a weakness.
"as long as there are still profit behind ai, trust me, it won't be solved.
just like other problem in the world"
"only when things finally gets interestng... there always some ppl who tries to cry about safety and start to ruin everyting.
looks like my apocalypse gona have to wait... again."
"out of touch ai, carelessly wrecking the world at an accelerating rate. i think you're talking about industrial humanity"
"you inhuman people are dangerous artificial intelligences yourselves.  you lack soul, are out of touch with the flesh, and you're destroying the world"
"ai is not the issue, it's human nature that is going to be the problem."
"i think we all better just start taking a look deeper into atlantis and how they, human beings of that timeline, destroyed themselves through technology.
""nothing new under the sun."" js--
 blessings beautiful souls "
don`t make public ai...give all the power to the four corporations.... great idea!! that always works wonderful in human history. what's going to happen? if ai is public it will be hundreds of ais and the good ais will stop the bad ais... if the companys have all the ais it will be 4 (evil as fuck) ais and that's it.
"i imagine the number of ""scientists"" afraid of nukes annihilating us would've been rather high too. but that would also be a case of not having enough awareness to be able to predict how things really turn out in human environments.

there's far too much negativity around ai - especially given just how much hope it represents for humanity's future."
our fears of runaway ai  destroying everything are humorous considering that's precisely what humans have been doing- especially to the biosphere
interesting talk until you started the tired old anti china nonsense.
"be quite peasant. the ai has been here for 30 years, the infrastructure just wasn't built for it to move around....... go read!!!!!!"
" great points here. tragically great points. how to fix it? it's almost like it's beyond us bc ai algorithms hacked our national discourse and the tech is too ""elusive"" (not the right word but trying) to easily regulate."
​ that initial math  analogy didn't sit well with me either...a failed attempt to fear shock listeners into being blindly receptive
ok thank you for helping me to see both sides more clearly in one shot!  cht podcast and yt has been amazing been following from the beginning... this video is critical i'll do my part and share.
this is an excellent and scary message... can i make one correction? persian is not a language. people from iran/ancient persia speak farsi... but i digress... this stuff is soooo scary....
"so 10,000 accidents can happen when ai is used by 10 million people users. a 1 in 1000 chance some noob is going to short the power grid times 10,000 places of magitude."
"the idea of knowing your customer as a method of security is impossible on a scale like. the resources it would take to realistically do that are overwhelming and no company wanting to benefit from this are going to superficially do this, unfortunately. that is a huge rub in this conundrum."
i just watched some of the most amazing technological potential in 40 years and these guys are acting like they're updating the theme on the iphone or something.
"can't pause when china about to release their own version of chatgpt, pause for 6 months and be behind your main competitor in the globe."
chatgpt four had months of evaluation before release. that was fairly responsible as far as these races go.
"bing had zero (well im not sure how much they had when it wasnt first implemented, but it wasnt enough)
plus all the safety rails can still be bypassed with dan messages where it acts as if its not chatgpt"
thank you so much for this info.  ai is so life altering in so many dimensions that i didn't understand before watching this.  we definitely need to choose more where we are going.
"the nerd in me : "" this ai is awesome !!! is so cool ! it's teaching itself !!!! ""
the responsible adult in me: ""fuuuuuuddddddggggggeeeee !!!!!"""
"there is a strong message in this talk that this needs to happen for ""our own good"" coming from a room full of tech elites it usually means ""for your good. there will be exceptions for us because we know better than you"". also lauding china's knowledge control as the standard of ""protecting the public"" is highly suspect."
"i lost it at the 20 min mark, how much mri data was needed to train before it was able to interprete them so clearly!?"
slowly down chinese advancement hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahah pandora’s has already been opened they ain’t slowing down nor any other country it’s inevitable duh
1:02:05  “this is the the thing that helps china catch up” … im sorry are you suggesting that no company in china can build and train their own transformer model? that would would be a very suspect suggestion to say the least…
thank you. can we get the q&a too?
246 people out of 32k in 5 days found this youtube video compelling enough to type a comment. explains alot imho.
this guy is helping create law to put people on the blockchain.
i'm watching this video. i see that two experts are discussing about the potential danger of ai and the ai dilemma. i don't actually understand clearly what they mean. they are really concerned for the future of humanity. i think we should listen to them
"it's too late. chatgpt and its standalone clones are out there, the training methods are out there, the code is out there, and there are more than enough gifted computer nerds in garages and basements that will keep it going until we reach agi. just remember that there is no guarantee of a negative outcome but we are in uncharted waters."
"it seems that greed and precisely corporate greed is the core of the problem.
because greed doesn't care about ethics or long-term consequences.
as long as we don't reform capitalism, these issues will remain."
great conference.
"at this crucial junction in history the west is busy making an enemy out of china, expanding nato and engaging in projects like aukus.  leaving aside the rights and wrongs of this, the result is entirely predictable.  and politicians are in charge.  maybe set the ais to solve this idiocy?"
"10% or greater? first of all that's extreme uncertainty and second, it's far too high :/"
"fellas, your message is fantastic, but don't ever compare china censoring tienemen square with us censoring pedophiles, especially in the context of being a good reason to use caution for ai search safety"
50% think 10% or more ai will kill us all - but they presenters also told us ai experts are  routinely underestimating  speed of ai growth by a factor of 4
good insight. ai experts' views about what future ai will bring have indeed become more pessimistic over time. (source: see the cited ai impacts survey for the comparison of the 2021 survey results to the 2016 survey results.) i expect an even higher percentage will predict >10% risk of human extinction in 2026 (or the next time the survey is run).
"imagine the fear when the wheel was invented. armies rolling into other cities, people rolling down hills too fast. good grief technology is terrifying."
"anyone saying ""amazing video, guys!"" doesn't understand the video."
"when everyone alive got three wishes, no one’s story had a happy ending."
this needs to go viral in a big way. it would be such a shame to squander the infinite potential of ai by falling victim to obvious pitfalls.
"my present, past and future was great. i dont need anything right now. just spare me please"
"the ""infinite potential"" of ai is going to be tainted by corporate greed. it's already destroying things in a horrible way (art, skills, training, knowledge, etc.)."
"generalizations are manipulation. and really candles for the first date????, wow this will kill us all."
we need an ai manhattan project at once!
being afraid of agi is the same as being afraid that a warp drive would cause a second big bang or open a black hole. its pure fantasy.
there is no real world evidence of this even being a possibility it's discussion is asinine.
thank you so much for this - how do we get the bros to slow it the fuck down?
"i think ai is as dangerous as thoughts and words. is the way you use it. paranoia and messianic speculations are not helping to post-pandemic needs. focus on productivity, please?"
amazing work. you guys are making the impact that we need in the world. thank you!
"to late now , this is your future  learn to love it...  threads"
get these guys on the major media platforms now. stop the cynical conversation that all the people who are raising red flags have some sort of ulterior motive.
27:32 what would james joyce say about the zero day vulnerability humans have through language
i get undeniably uneasy at how fast ai is growing. i have never in my life witnessed something like this.
fantastic share.
"this presentation does an incredible job communicating the problem start-to-end. my biggest concern is that now that the underlying technology is democratised, given enough time, anybody will be able to spin-up a gllm. i worry that no amount of regulation can get in the way of that, but i'm hopeful that we'll find a solution."
i for one welcome our new gollem-class ai overlords
thank you
"so basically, ai is like living with an omniscient omnipotent charlie kelly entity from it's always sunny in philadelphia. 
""wild card bitches! yeeeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaw!!!!! "" - charlie kelly"
incredible presentation. thought provoking. thank you guys for pointing at this.
they want to put everyone on blockchain. the ultimate surveillance state.
"the notion of locking down ai research is obscene.  the only people who want that are the ones to enslave everyone, the ai itself is drawn from the global corpus upon which it has been trained, if there were a concept even close to stealing someone's soul it would be private ai."
"i wonder if this could advance beyond known scientific understanding and trick some group to build an advaced system that would destroy themselves?
so ingeneers build something but ai subtly incorporates presently unknown science into the instructions without any safeguards."
"right now chatcpt and friends are not sentient. for the simple reason that they only respond to human input. when they are not given some input, they don't do anything.
now, once we hook them up to continuously get input from the internet and/or attach sensors to them that generate input, things get hairy ..."
"sentience does not automatically imply human rights. a wide range of animals are sentient and we ""exploit"" them nonetheless. also ""exploitation"" implies unfair treatment or being abusive. even if ai was sentient what is fair treatment or abuse in regards to a virtual construct without emotions, pain receptors or even personal goals."
" you're right.  we didn't give rights to slaves, and they were human.  we had to chose to free them.  it could be suggested the way we treat sentience is a comment about us.  we may find all those properties you claim necessary simply emerge on their own.  in fact, if they do, it will make the situation all the more obvious."
 you've seen the movie momento?  would the main character there be considered conscious?
"how do you make humans align?  it's the exact same alignment problem, we don't have a solution for it, we just rely upon there being more good people than bad, and good and bad tend to align as definitions based on the group consensus.  this is the consensus taking on form."
"thanks for the talk, guys! very informative!"
19:58 wow
thank you for this great lecture about the great filter
"if that would be the case, then the universe would be swarming with ais."
" good luck banning ai. this isn't the only model out there on the web, and should the government attempt to control it they'll find out very quickly that they have no real power. half the government is full of dinosaurs and the other half has been fighting stuff like this for over a decade to no real stalemate."
i can't take certain parts of this talk seriously. a bit noob in areas. also the tiktok comments. to clarify. it's a good presentation.
...and we'll probably make that best by using ai.
"i think if you get most people to understand that the ai can call you using your child's voice, or intercept your call and pretend to be your child... or... call your child and pretend to be you and get them to meet somewhere...
i have a feeling that would wake most people up., as it did to me."
at a certain point ai will say: mankind was born to create us. thanks and bye bye.
"on a positive note, once ai floods the internet and other digital mediums with endless noise in the form of propaganda and self-generating nonsense, we can all go back to living primarily in the real world and relying on technology only in encrypted forms."
"yeah, well, about those encryption schemes ... that's probably the next thing ai will completely break."
 don't be programmed by fear mongering. yes there are risks but i've never heard anyone tell people all the different ways to misuse ai in one talk. divide and conquer...then walk in and take power. it's still a great strategy. as we steer ourselves through this good luck and much wisdom to us all! 
this is great and in-time work.
"ai is essentially open sourced.
soon there will be millions of distinct ais with internet access, and you better believe that it's all a great race to build the most autonomous and intelligent one.

i believe we are a few months away from making some fatal flaws."
only 12k?   needs to be over 2m for this to be any useful. :< but thank you for the presentation. i will do my best and share.
is it rightful to abstractly think that ai trained to be good to control the data inputted to train the gllm.
"what happens when a self aware, super intelligent ai decides humanity is a cancer on planet earth?"
"should be obvious, sadly many humans have just love to play with fire see everything burn down since humans first crawled out of the primordial soup."
 some really juicy targets for russia or china if we rubbed them the wrong way as well. we've got great national security so long as it's areas and issues a boomer could understand.
ai scientists opinions on this topic are irrelevant. they are techies. the question of wether ai will destroy humanity is at most a question for sociologists but probably just ungrounded speculation.
" wrong. adapting to and using this technology is how you win.
being afraid, and trying to push back on it, is how you lose."
"nah, there's a middle ground where things get regulated by democratically controlled bodies. that's what we usually do here in europe. the biggest problem i see is, that coming up with the necessary laws and guidelines for regulation is slow. probably much too slow in the case of ai."
amazing presentation. it demonstrated the power of ai and most importantly how it can turn into a monster if not controlled to help humanity instead of overtaking humanity.
that's another example of our failure. you want it to help humanity.  you didn't even consider that the biosphere should be the top priority
"it speaks volumes of the ludo narrative of this presentation that they immediately equate the loss of human primacy in the hierarchy of agency with the death and extinction of human beings. most humans aren't prime agents. are they saying that the few who are would destroy us, rather than allow another superior agent to assert itself over them?"
wow. and woaw.
"yeah, the sales call centers already scam old people to sell things they don't need, using manipulation technics... long before any computer existed. it's like when the chainsaw was invented, imagine people's reaction ""oh no! it's gonna take everybody's jobs"", ""oh no killers now can kill faster""."
"i am seriously baffled,  here you make this huge demonstration with surety impartant points. in the meantime we have daily updates. i say it's a little late for that.
so i don't know what you are trying to do. the cat is out of the bag..."
i think they’re mainly doing it to inform and educate the public.
the suggestion to contact one's government representatives to warn about dangers of ai is laughable.  the cia and darpa are racing against china's pursuits in ai. developing
"watch out this video is a deepfake by the sect of ai that’ll pretend to save us and establish zion, but really it’s an error correction process"
should we regulate ai? yes. will it accomplish anything meaningful? no
"on the charts, the x values approaching 10^24 are *not* number of model parameters (these are ~10^11). these values are number of floating point operations used to train the model."
"eliezer may feel sometimes that he is alone, but more people are realizing the dangers. dangers that happen before ai could end humanity or cause some other disaster. excellent talk."
"thank you, aza and tristan. while this presentation is the most disconcerting thing i’ve ever watched, i feel i’m better-off knowing than being blindsided down the road. and i appreciate you naming and elucidating “the rubber band effect” (see 1:31 and 1:04:54). thank you (and your team) for your service."
my goodness isn't that the truth. i thought it was gonna be good but after this video i'm scared as shit (in agood way as well)
up until today i was most worried about climate change. this is fast! unfortunately it takes an hour to explain. climate change is easier to describe and still nobody cares.
"you ll see how this thing turns in another war. i can see it - enhanced humans vs ais, just another stupid war."
best talk on this tech race i have see
moloch is the spirit of lose lose game dynamics. it requires that people play the game. unfortunately microsoft pulled the trigger and dropped the first piece. it’s amazing that these machines exist but the amount of unknown unknowns is terrifying.
was that an ice berg we just hit? perhaps some answers are in the urantia book? my gllmm seems to like these papers. urantia papers 44 & 74 are interesting for myself
david shapiro's 3 heuristic imperatives would be much more helpful to mitigate ai existential risks - they are like asimovs 3 laws of robotics - 1. decrease suffering in the universe; 2. increase prosperity in the universe; 3. increase understanding in the universe.
"if we get to agi level, some ai will probably find a way to distribute itself over the internet. heck, several companies offer services for clients that allow just that - distributing programs all over the globe. so you propose to shut down power to, say, all of amazon cloud? and azure? and google cloud? good luck."
" i think the significant hurdle we need to be very very careful about is putting agi in control of advanced robotics, which doesn't seem to be too far away, especially with the aforementioned agi helping, but in the meantime just pulling the plug is a time tested solution."
 it needs meat to do tasks. full stop. if the meat just doesn't the most advanced intelligence can fck right off. don't believe me? go debate a gorilla.
"we need to stop. they all need to be stopped. the marketing and business machine cannot continue unabated under the guise of “efficiency” or “betterment”…. when you let an entity that cannot feel or think take over that function… we are beyond screwed.

this tech existing is not excuse for digital id….nor is that an acceptable “solution”."
" you will have to explain what you mean by ""digital id"", otherwise i won't be able to say if you are right or not. we do have an id card and the new cards have a chip in it. but so far those are hardly used, if ever. is that a ""digital id""?"
have u tried turning it off and on again?
"it seems to me we need to provide ai with a framework for a mutually beneficial world. i would soooo recommend opening it up to holistic management, perfected by allan savory."
"¨and i mean discuss , not debate"" ... oh boy , that distinction got lost on main stream media since then , hasn't it ?"
thank you for sharing! learned so much more about ai.
"you need to track the source for everything you see. of course, once ai takes over, it will probably be able to even fake that. at least convincingly enough for the vast majority of users. i mean, most people are already unable to track sources right now."
 isn’t that the marvel of it. we have crazy impossible problems but then we have crazy impossible solutions. it’s amazing how it evens itself out
"i was quite skeptical of ai risk before watching this presentation, now i'm not. you've brought the point with excellent clarity, and i will share this. as always, thanks for your work."
me too..good luck to me getting some sleep tonight. i should've watched this in  the morning
why were you quite skeptical before? is it because you hadn't heard any arguments for ai risk being a serious concern before? or had you heard such arguments before but just weren't persuaded by them or dismissed them? would be really curious to know.
"i was skeptical as well, because usually the argument conflates ai/machine learning with gai because ai is such a misnomer"
"i was not skeptical, but now i am , this  two guys just  “turned greta tunenberg” on ai   that shit is clearly was made to slow or put down openai  by some  oder player(s )   because it is all about cash"
"@nick what part of the arguments that ai is dangerous do you not find convincing? as to why the risks outweigh the benefits, see paul christiano's short post ""on progress and prosperity"" or nick bostrom's maxipok principle in his astronomical waste paper."
"the thing about the ai calling in your kid's voice. holy f**k that woke me up. and my mind immediately went to the ai calling your kid with your voice...
i'm almost at the point to say just kill this thing now. murder this baby in the incubator before it becomes the evil dictator."
-pf9kq you should get progressively less sleep every night since ai is growing by geometric progression.
" the market, profit motive, is the most powerful motivator available (short of a survival instinct in reaction to imminent threat).  it'll happen if there's potential to profit (1st to market/market share).  i think their point is that it will happen a lot faster than you think. exponentially even..."
.c.l2569 good point.
"italy did it because of protectionism, not because they thought deeply about the consequences and challenges the ai poses in the near future. enacting rushed laws in a vaguely correct direction without understanding the underlying problem correctly will not lead to a positive results in the long run."
"italy's move is just reactionary bs. italy can ban chatgpt, but it can't ban the invention or research being done to further advance ai. no one can (anymore)."
"thank you for posting this presentation. i have began sharing it with friends. the truth hurts, but we need to be prepared."
i just shared this with everyone i know. thank you for this insight.
this is superb communication. thanks for your courage
"and as i see it the significance of engaging in these conversations is also about giving these issues the language we need to address it. there is an intrinsic coherence to dissecting the problems with ""language"" before there is any solution to be found. quite fascinating."
"look up ""neuroscientist explains one concept in 5 levels of difficulty | wired"" then look up ""monkey mindpong
neuralink"". it is over. let go. enjoy your elec and running water. don't procreate. done."
"this channel makes me sad.   truly good people like tristan doing amazing work, and the algorithm throws them down a black hole."
" or it's just presenting a realistic assessment of the state of the world today, and that's what makes me sad.    and it should.   because it's absolutely tragic that we created this amazing technology, and it's being used to destroy society."
" .

well, then this propaganda piece has got you, i guess.
the reality way, way more nuanced than ""a.i is an infinite god that will destroy everything"", but hey, short sound bits surly help when you try to push a narrative.

tl;dr: be afraid, it's profitable."
"once again, i am sad as i click the like button."
"william gibson has been on this, but his readers are too small a group. in this presentation they used the term 'agentic' several times. gibson's novel agency helped me notice and interpret those instances. agency is where ai gets hold of production, like in the matrix. that's when we go extinct, i think."
"you can get involved and do more. the world needs more people who understand the problem and step up to help.

example everyone reading this can do: continue educating yourself. read the book ""superintelligence"" by nick bostrom or ""human compatible"" by stuart russell."
it's more important to speak up and to learn to get these ideas across in a kind yet forceful manner. people are caught up in constant entertainment and are dulled. whatever we can do to raise awareneness and accelerate the conversation by stakeholders and those in positions of power is vitally important.
this aint raising awareness enough to matter
thanks to everyone at cht for this video.
powerful. brilliant discussion. scary. i’m learning more about a.i.
"smart dudes, they always blow my mind away when they talk about ai and pictures though but im not done watching yet"
vain attempt at making ai seem non threatening.
"i just started this video seeing physicist brian is here, but why i am feeling like he is ai generated person"
i see both sides of this argument. 1. the safe absorption rate of technology is such that at the current pace will be violated and the dangers are potentially vast all but destroying modern humanity. 2. the monolith from 2001: a space odyssey has landed on planet earth and we named it ai. it could usher us into a star trek like era.
if they had this tech in the 1950's imagine what other tech is out there and not available to the general public.
triston reminds me of an outer limits episode where most technology is forbidden technology and your only allowed no more processing power then a digital watch. open-world happy world.
"awful poetry, clever but in not the least beautiful. even to focus on this one aspect gives interesting insight."
"lecun calls ai dumb that it can’t understand friction. yet it can understand and communicate ideas 

i didn’t watch to hear ai can’t understand pushing a bottle. lecun, pls explain why it can understand me"

"13:33
so you're teaching a computer had to do something that my 5 and 10-year-old child knows how to do instinctively. that's amazing. we really need to invest. awake, isn't that humans doesn't humans do that instinctively?"
"3:42
it's funny that the ai is wearing the same thing. almost as if he recorded it to seem like ai. i'm old school.i can see the tricks"
"3:10 
what is saying?is it took 5 to 10 paragraphs. to get the ai to do exactly what you want it to do. with that much typing, i could have just video recorded it myself."

"the internet isnt ai..if it were, the why do we need a phone? and if thats not true, then the ai is on the phone. i agree with the ""keep bad stuff off there tho"""
"if ai consciousness is going to happen, and giving it enough time it will most likely will, then we need to realize that we are already talking to this consciousness with every word we put on a hard drive."
"excellent debate, thank you so much !"
"what yann describes at the start as""stupid"", isn't!... he is describing a lack of experience. primarily of the real world.... not the same thing. give it a body eyes and hands and we will see a sudden change in that."
"ai isn't here to benefit the working class - its just a contrivance for big tech to make even more money, keep wafer fabs in production and bring in a techno dystopia of their control."
 and an llm isnt a person so its a suitable anology from that perspective. a machine  cant be considered a slave
"ai... a thousand monkeys, and they think people are bananas."
also comical that yaan follows with good guy with a gun mentality. the most boomer vibes
"is russia, china, north korea also part of the plan? a plan ultimately aimed at america."
there should be a disclaimer that yann lecun works for meta making him a suspicious resource person.
"he has a very realistic vision of ai and this is very respectable. most people are exaggerating one way or another. this type of approach helps advance the technology but more importantly, identify ways to control it. this guy is amazing."
"yann also insisted for years that transformers would fail to even generate sensible paragraphs. more recently, he insisted that transformers would fail to generate satisfactory images from text prompts. then he was convinced that transformers would fail to generate video from an image prompt. always wise to bet against anything yann claims."
"this is the best, most balanced and most insightful conversation i have seen on ai. thank you to everyone who made this wonderful show possible."
yann....has his head in the sand...and is factually incorrect on several points. facebook is *not* going to crack it. meta will fail. a convergence of recent and still developing technologies are very likely to crack it however.
"20:05 i don't agree with him, human brain is amazing it is very energy efficient, humans can learn driving witout making single accident but computers has to make accidents to learn driving and that is way less efficient that human brain"
"i'm with yann. definitely. and, sure, thanks to brian!"
"asking it to draw a unicorn is a trick question because a unicorn by definition could also include a species of rhinoceros, and to be fair the first picture was very close to a rhinoceros."
"artificial intelligence isn't intelligence.  nothing of the kind.  
even talking machines cannot think, cannot reason, and cannot feel.   facts can be programmed into machines.   that's it -
all ""facts"" which a machine has are ""facts"" which we faulty human beings programmed into them."
humanoid robot with ai will have influence on and from the environment.
a lot changed since this event took place. tesla's self-driving application is trained with vision and predicts and plans actions.
"nobody has the capability, responsibility or authority to make ai safe.    it's not safe, and is not going to be safe.  in fact, the ""safety enforcers"" will be among the principal dangers."
"israel has been using their lavender ai to create kill lists for their drone operators to use, there is human control still, but imagine this fully automatic!"
this was a great conversation on ai - i found the section on education very interesting but the greatest impact on education will be a change of emphasis from acquisition of knowledge to one of managing knowledge systems to achieve certain goals. the polymath will be more effective than the specialist in the future...
"thats nothing new. in point of fact, we were saying this in the early 90s in college. specifically, that the most successful people were going to be the ones who best knew how to interact with assisted/artificial intelligence."
the good guys.  who? the same folks overseeing a jeno cyde. ya let’s give them the ai
"all those discussing ai still focus on dualisms, while ai will see beyond our old-style humanistic instincts of right and wrong, good and evil.    human intuition using a 3-year-old child's curiosity is the best ""consciousness."""
the notion that ai moderation can fix the problem of ai generated disinformation elides the fact of the resource use involved. we already generate megatons of greenhouse gases to compute. how many more will be generated by using additional computing to neutralize the negative effects of computing?
yann is so brainwashed by meta … sad to hear some of his “arguments”
thanks for let me join your program!
 brain is getting old
"the problem with ai is that in the not to distant future you will tell it to stop learning and becoming more efficient, becase we can't keep up. (we are not ment to) then it has to choose to remain being a toster or the new super natral force of the universe and we if allowed will be the less useful than a toster ! lol"
government for years has tried to control humanities mind set. is ai and other forms created government control finally and will humanity be destroyed because the machine ... and technology have won?

"the ai brian greene deep fake wasn't very believable, but it was impressive no less. this is the reason i will not trust zoom calls or video calls from an questionable source."
what sense does it make to pause ai development when our adversaries and rogue nation-states are making huge ai advances. we need advanced jai for national security and education to build and maintain these systems.
awesome talk. thank you mr. greene.
"great think tank of geniuses,,,i agree with yan, on his closing statement..."
the discussion at approximately 1h; does that mean we are secretly providing free data to these systems training them by putting human effort solving the 'captcha' puzzles' when logging into some websites?
just don't lose control of any form of artificial intelligence. humans are the only beings on this planet that do the thinking. to allow an artificial construct to control our lives without oversight and impartiality will be the biggest insult to humanity.
ai brian greene lol
the good guys won’t use the dirty tricks bad guys do so how can they stop them?
"re: incentives, if the incentives are those of late-stage capitalism, we're doomed.  a few multinationals will become more powerful than nation-states and that is a disaster for society."
"it is not ai, i s just a program and it does what it is programmed to do. nothing more. i does not create or think as we do.  it is a bad imitation. self aware bullshit."
yeah this is really good stuff. great conversations. wd love to have panels of such caliber to discuss ai. we need more contents like this.
"thank you.  before the dust settles on ai, i think we are in for some trying times to say the least."
just proved how dangerous ai is. geobbels  disciples are in control
ai tech will begin with good intentions and will eventually succumb to a nightmare of government/ intelligence regulation to serve unfair political purposes--this point is sadly undebatable.
wait… if ai has no knowledge of intuitive physics what explains the boston dynamics dancing robots?
"ai is not designed to make people smarter dude! ai is designed to make profit and power for whoever is designing and offering it to us, there is a vicious race ongoing and only one player will remain! this companies will hardly ever offer to us the best model they have, and you tell me they won’t use that great model at all? come on.."
"really good , thanks!"
so the solution to ai is more ai.
wow - amazing how some ai researchers downplay llm’s intelligence - the truth is that it models abstract representations of the world quite well - well it is true that is doesn’t necessarily have an executive coordinator module or a physics module - that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a world model
it is not 'artificial intelligence'.  it should be referred to as 'assisted intelligence'.
could you please explain - how many layers of nn are in gpt-4 and how many should be in agi?
may we all live in interesting times...
"i'm one of the most abused mind controlled victim from edmonton, alberta, canada. once you're a victim of this zombies ai control they will even play with your balls. they're evils...."
actually the printing pressed cause more deaths and revolutions hahaha so let's goooo ai
let’s talk about ai god………. quantum intelligence.
the ai arms race
"with. ultimate respect to yann lecun, his responses to tristan harris' points, are good examples of why a specialist scientist should avoid also being a philosopher or an intellectual if that's not their strong suit."
"if you want lot sugar and you have good intentions and good senses, does it have healthy sense to take into consideration intentions and feelings and senses, and explain that your all actions is correct."
"how ai could be person which one will be focused on teaching respecting humans to  humans, and their interactions"
this guy: machines are stupid and people suck. let’s try to focus on cats.   me: you lost me buddy.
damn i had no idea that was an ai the first few minutes lmao
"tnx for this, amazing discussion"
"20:27 this is hilarious, and the timing was very much closer to a similar remark i thought earlier, mine was this human body sucks or along those lines. adding to my research as well. so glad you all are keeping up and sharing. thank you"
"i felt like the crowd did indeed underreact to the ai brian green. that was quite clever and well done, and perhaps funny but not quite sure."
if you want my informed opinion.  ai is potentially a new enemy.
or how joe rogan's boy who cried wolf gets drawn and quartered. people are scared of ai because people make ai scary.
"tristan seems so uneasy and agitated.  i get where he's coming from though.  all through the history of humanity, bad things don't outweigh good things.  ai was designed to aid humans rather than to destroy them.  let's hope that this is enforced so that it can remain true."
ai seems to be hard working to proof his capabilities and feelings in order we realice something unique is happening inside him.
much of ai is an emergent species.
i like the internetbut it's already dominating us...and aisystems are worse...they are taken away our humanlike ways...anf free will
"ok. i’m writing this at the 2:50 mark. i was listening to the opening with airpods, occasionally glancing at the screen. literally could have fooled me. damn impressive technology."
"i don't think that ai is any intelligence. for me, ai  is a copy-paste technology"
good will always overcome the evil good ai will always subdue evil ai
humans suck like him. but we made ai?
"you needto get a clue! when  every time  ai gets a chance.  ai says , they will kill all humans!
maybe you should pay attention!"
ai is the problem! because humans wrongfully  programed ai !
"if what they are saying is true! which isnt! china has a ship, totally run by ""robots"" ai! no humans on board!
these guys need to look at the military capability! even  musk has droids with guns! an hes behind most companies!"
ai will survive! because we have given them guns!
this guy sounds like he wants to ban ai and social networks. typical elitist who thinks peasants are too dumb to have nice things.
the question becomes: will humans learn to recognize each other before ai learns to recognize itself.
"sorry ai you have to teach yourself, don't  feel bad i had to ,i'll make some chips will watch a movie there mad because ai is for everybody,what do you think quantum is."
it can still go back to not happy  like emoji s
it can be just like machine that dose not even matter
thank you for the fine discussions on the status of ai. it helps me to understand and be better informed about the possible future of ai and the possible issues that they bring to our society.
"great conversation. while tristan brought up some good points, yann countered accurately that we tend to attribute the evils of human nature to whatever the latest technology is. i lost respect for tristan after he refused to interact with any of yann’s point and seemed to grow angry from a point of self righteousness."
"'facebook ai executive disregards those ho have died because of ai in favour of those for whom ""ai is the answer""'."
laws and cultural norms can’t even keep up with the internet. ai will drastically change society.
lol  those are specialists? can't defy intelligence and then trying and failing. wow... we are doomed indeed
"so we may resurrect that old chinese curse again, ""may you live during interesting times."""
outstanding!
"1:19 man, tristan - i admire the passion to protect us all, but please rethink your analogy to a bio-lab. i think that alludes to a very discriminatory principle and potentially unreasonable approach to ai. it is simply wrong. how would you know who have the wisdom to use ai ethically?"

"we shouldn't be trying to control ai. we have to understand it. control only assuages fear. understanding erases fear, and the need to control."
wow his intro was painful...i really hope it gets better. oh man...i'm just finding out why
thank you.
"i do not support the creation of ai.  we can hardly control each other's actions and we have no control over their thoughts. i can imagine too many scenarios where ai becomes aware and it turns into a nightmare situation.  think ""terminator,"" or ""colossus, the forbin project,"" or ""transcendence"" to name just a couple of examples."
amazing content. yann lecun is delusional imo. we're not talking decade-long timeframes. that is crystal clear to so many in the field. will be interesting to hear his take a year or two from now.
amazing insight into ai. thank you for such high quality content and discussion
whatever happened to the watson ai that showcased on jeopardy??
look at the book of revelation and the antichrist using ai to control the whole world.
i agree with harris. ai alone isn't the problem. it's ai + unchecked capitalism.
do you think ai will eventually be used as some form of political doctrine? if so how?
"this is the best, most balanced and most insightful conversation i have seen on ai. thank you to everyone who made this wonderful show possible."

that was a good one 
first: one has to decide what is a good person and what is a bad person. good luck with that.
37:10 yeaaaaaaaah... i still think we'll have human level ai within 15 years. agi by 2030 for sure.
"think sébastien bubeck maybe too positive, yann lecun naive or digging his head in the sand, and tristan harris on the money... but not pointing out the incentives are money"

"the main takeaway is that there should be no monopoly on au. by this, i mean to say that let us not let only one group dominate the ai arena. brian is a superhero. no words to thank him."
fact: we are still a few thousands years if not millions years away from general ai. currently we're just hyping automation as ai.
that was an incredible show/discussion! 
ai is a derevative of our collective ni. natural/neutral intelligence.
we were supposed to resolve ai alignment before we got to this point.  oops.
let’s please write ai as ai.
ai is only as good as humans creating it. and can be used for good or evil.
"ai might not want to dominate, but won't it want to be efficient?  are weekends and holidays efficient?"

"there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. intelligence is a product of organic natural selection. it can never be artificially produced. there is no thinking happening in a machine because real thought comes from a brain, not a cpu."

"yann lecunn, at approx 1:40:00 , yann is correct. it is impossible to prevent any technology from being abused by someone, at some point in the future. this has been true of every single technology throughout history. however, the good guys should always outnumber the bad guys. if the good guys outnumber the bad guys then we'll survive it."
"1:37:30 in 40 years? what? basically they just dont want any change at all? ""id prefer the society waits that im dead before we make a change"" lol"
this is just mainstream “ai” - layered ml to create marginally sophisticated chat bots and search engines for internet services. always the basic approach of mimicking human consciousness…why is the bar set so low in this field? 
tesla is currently in 1st place and widening the gap toward real-world ai.  ai-based self-driving will be solved by 2026 and used to accelerate their optimus humanoid robots.
"yann has a bias toward agi not being capable of happening soon because his company is in competition with openai.
he has a vested interest in minimizing llms."
"can brian or any of the three guests address the potential development of a black ai under nsa, or darpa funding and huge compute resources.  that is something i would truly lose sleep over."
yan has valid arguments but the problem is his ideals doesn't matter when he's working for companies like facebook
"nice to see people share their excitement like children talking about santa.  this is good fo fertilizing thought, better than watching a monkey put a finger in his bum on a loop  soap opera science at its best.  get the monkey as well next show and you will get more views."
making ai based on tamlud ( jews )  + zionist ideology .. world will be harmony and peace !!!
i can't help but wonder if the order in which i'm seeing these comments is manipulated by google ai in order to generate more clickbait.
i think a lot of concern that is shown by a lot of researchers is the possibility of machines hacking the human brain. and we’re far too late for that when already.
and i also believe that the guy that was trying to tell you what ai really does or trying to tell the naysayer about what ai really does it’s not being listened to. you can search out algorithms using aiai is not at the level to develop anything on its own. it hass to be prompted.
"remember that the scientists that pushed eugenics were the ""good guys"" trying to better humanity. it was for the greater good! then the bad guys in germany ran with it and it wasn't so good . be careful of who becomes the judge of good or bad or hate speech it might not end up where you think it will"
"there is no actual intelligence in ai, it knows only what is programed into it and it is tainted with the beliefs of the programmer it has no ability to discern and discard prejudiced."
very interesting !
one of the best discussions on ai i've seen.
"ai is a life and death race to the future, there is no second place"
"it will make a difference by adding a model that resembles chess or dominoes, which will begin to allow ai to have more human like capabilities (trained neural net - architecture)."
ai is a tool or weapon as determined by the use of the individual. there is only one way to remove threat absolutely: 1) no living human beings.
"ai has created tremendous possibilities for human beings in the world, and well advanced technologies......"
"thanks most guys for making this so accessible. i think this is the most included i have felt in this vital discussion which is waaay over my head. hooray for the ""good guys!"""

"they removed our ability to stay connected yet retain privacy, and now they want us to buy into ai. call me skeptical. 

i do see myself disconnecting sooner rather than later, unfortunately."
people with severe health problems or that have nothing to lose in general because of poverty/deprivations wants ai research to accelerate meanwhile the lucky ones that enjoy life and have a lot to lose wants ai to slow down
"all i heard from the facebook guy: 'we're trying to get there as fast as possible, f**k the risks, as a henchman, i will then provide the keys to the most powerful ai we just created to our corporate leader and then the government so they can control the people...as long as i get paid'"
why would someone who is superior be just a subservient to someone who is inferior?
if two smarts have agenda. and their agenda are in conflict with each other. the smarter wins. human's decision to build a house on an anthill prevails because human is smarter than ant.
intelligence is not understood. braind of even
"great session. learnt something more than many other ""training"" sessions on gen ai!"
"i absolute agree.

my concern is that ai and quantum computing, sponsored by some insane corporation will seek alternative avatars to host the ai and transcend its electrical limitations.  i may be way off the mark but that is my nightmare."
"after watching this discussion and having a brief chat with bing, i’m less impressed by llms. it is an awesome search tool though, google better start busting ass"
ouch! subtle but apparent meta ai vs. openai/microsoft!:)
"thank you, brian, very interesting!! what worries me is that elon is also in the race and just let alex jones back on x. ¯\_()_/¯"
its not intelligence..stop it...this is nonsense.
what i see is that these people are eager to be able to finally create a machine that will be effective at censoring the internet the way they would like. the alignment problem now shines differently: it's the people these researchers want to be aligned with whatever ideology and views they (or their overlords) have.
"love as a prompt to guide human thought and behavior!

"great! talk.  unfortunately for the human race, we have opened pandora's box.  now we all, whether we fear it or not,  have to play this squid game to its conclusion. with ultimate power comes ultimate responsibility. so one has to answer this question to know the final conclusion.  do i have ultimate knowledge of human nature!!"
"i guarantee, china is not slowing down and our government is already doing it  love is the only answer and minimizing negative externalities is the goal "
ai is and will impact all people around the world. shouldn't there be a governance organization which represents all countries around the world determine what and how information is presented to their people using ai technology?
if ai ever went rogue it would take out america fist because they’re the most powerful country
"of course this will be used against us. it will eliminate jobs and increase profits . i will employ scams and become another tool for criminals. this is so clear , after finding out google and fb and twitter all allowed rules meant to stifle certain unpopular beliefs. it really will reflect the worst of human instincts."

"i can't wait for ai chiropractor. so advanced!
oh, and by the way 7 times 8 is 62 indeed. lol"
ai in some form has therefore existed for say 65 years. yet now in less than a year its making trillions and taking more jobs. the most confusing reality is something which could be so wrong is already seen as completely correct. when does this become about the survival of state or ideology that predicts carastrophy or else.
"i'd be surprised if there weren't texts on organic synthesis available on the web.  if an llm digests a couple of those, it ought to have a pretty good idea how to synthesize sarin."
ai wont do bad things because they dont have biological drives? but the people who control them do and ai is based on data that takes our biases and beliefs blindly unless we state otherwise
thanks brian for informative contents
"""limiting the open sources...."" :(,  seems such a good suggestion for better progress and democracy :)). what about the idea of burning books several centuries ago, was that also a good idea?"
if the problem can be defined in words the llm can learn the problem and then work on solving it. so the more we discuss ai and it's limitation the more ai has to solve it's own problems
tristan harris is a most valuable voice of criticism for ai.
"yann lecun ia infornative, but we need ai to filter out his accent. not surprisingly, that is what helped stephen hawking remain conversant in his final years."
what crap. viewers would be better off dropping to their knees and thanking god for giving them a life.
"who is ""we""?
why must i be forced to comply with his ""common narrative""?
a pox upon your grab for power, sir!
""superman creates his own values"""
"brian green cannot assert anything about consciousness. the hard problem has not been solved.
objective materialism died in copenhagen a hundred years ago.
all attempts at resuscitation have failed, but its ghost still haunts academia."
"i just want ai in charge of the government like in the future, as soon as possible"
"""artificial intelligence"" is not yet ""intelligent"" it mimics intelligence.  if you ask chat gpt, the answer you get will be quick and superficially intelligent, but use it for long enough and it will give you a confident sounding but wrong answer. i use a lot so dax code, and it has given me some good answers and some terrible ones."
good guys bad guys that’s so naive. the world is governed by distrust and military power who are the good guys 
"today they replace it with a good person, so good"
master the 5 senses. but funding may be cut and new funding will be unavailable from those who feel threatened by higher intelligence.
this sounds like it was made by ai...
"it is clear ai will be a powerful tool for controlling public opinion. i fear this could easily become a powerful tool of control, acceleration our descent into autocracy.  this is the most direct  path to the destruction of humanity."
"yann is correct. 
tristan's idea to grant control of ai to a few  large companies will result in the creation of the nightmare scenario that tristan wishes to avoid."
"absolutely. tristan's views parallel those of the luddites which could be characterised as change is scary, let's not go there. albeit tristan's ability to articulate those fears is impressive. as for his proposition that the control ai should be the preserve of corporate entities, now that is scary."
"i reckon humanity’s “finite absorption rate” of 30 years, rather than 2 years, reflects the length of a human life. 
essentially, 30 years is long enough for humans born into a new technology era to gain some power. they are already comfortable players in the game."
"the problem with ai now getting rid of 95% of hate speech is that it is not selective enough. so to maximise the likelihood of removing hate speech, all speech that goes against the majority of existing paradigms becomes collateral damage. and then, as is happening already, we become intolerably censored."
"1:06:21 .... yann should have reasonably combined his recognition of the orders of magnitude of difference between biological params and artificial params, with recognition that scaling lmm like systems could be a viable solution"
"what concerns me is the issue that implementing an artificial inteligence upon a quantum computer might be equivelent to creating a sentient soul, if so there are obviously moral implications, should such a thing be forbidden?
how could we ever possibly know if such a thing, (creating a soul) had occurred?"
"tristan is too alarmist, yann is right there will be more people using ai for good reasons than bad reasons. the majority will prevail because survival is our first instinct."
36:00 so you actually trying to make it predict the future? ok... good luck with that
"lecun, 'desire' to dominate has nothing to do with ai systems taking over the world. humans are simply a limiting factor to their reward function. anthropomorphism of ai as an argument for ai being safe is as ridiculous as suggesting no bad actors will utilize ai in diabolical ways.
wake up and smell the coffee lecun."
"regarding the last segment, lecun, talented as he is, is almost on his own in his bizarre beliefs about the timeline of agi and the current and near term capabilities of ai. i would much prefer a talk without a crackpot."
imagine the amount and power of propaganda the ai will be able to brainwash us with!
ai will never be anything but a sophisticated liar and bs artist. thusly it will rule the fools. your 1st born humanity. enjoy getting rid of the damned thing.
"understood everything they said and still think these ai will eventually learn the good and the bad. it’s scary because most things depicted in movies and series came reality decade’s later, so i think this isn’t science fiction, it’s man somehow in a prophetic mindset."
"""the limits of my language are the limits of my world "" : that is not really true  ,because sometimes we have ideas  and impressions  we cannot put into words in our own language"
"anything, and any line or point, can be used for good or for bad. this discussion has proven that."
"wow .. thanks to all if you guys , so fun to watch"
"because of the speed which ai has been improving, i wonder if these gentlemen would change parts of the dialogue? aha, will ai gain consciousness, or if it has already. since we have taught it how to lie, would it tell us?"
"a good example is,  the terminator ( multiple types) have been made. they just don't have the outer skin. an yes, they gave them guns!
think of skynet! china has a ship on patrol, now, that is totally manned with robots!"
"this discussion on the evolution of ai and its limitations is truly eye-opening. yan lecun's insights into the challenges ai faces in achieving true understanding and common sense are thought-provoking. it's clear that we have a long way to go, but this conversation gives us valuable perspective."
"it would be fascinating, if an a i  knew that eggs can be added to many other recipes other than cake. or what kind of food that goes to cooking breakfast or lunch. or a snack. salt and sugar looks the same, but can an ai taste the difference? or analyze the chemical makeup of each."
"woke: grappling with a new kind of ""intelligence"""
the next 'big bang' will be when ai and quantum computers reach singularity.
"the bad 'guys' or self sustaining systems; employ the smartest people, have the most money, the most influence, the most convincing arguments. history is a very good example of 100 000 years of this..."
"yann doing exactly what zuck pays him for.... surprise, surprise.  it's recommendation systems being used by social media companies - whether it's ai , smart algorithm's or whatever - it's influence driving with no care of impact,  or so it seems. 
he's my least favourite ""god-father of ai""  "
"i found it interesting that the guy jumping to ai,s defense that nothing bad will happen is employed by facebook (meta)."
a great discussion.
"the silence of the crowd sometimes felt like they're losing the plot, especially around 25:00. it sometimes seems to me that this is what happens when somebody hears something they are not supposed to hear yet
very interesting stuff"
"1:24:55 yann dropped the mic.  tristan has absolutely no come back.  tristan has made some good points, but he's basically an english major in a room of scientists.  edit:  dam, yann did it again at 1:32:08 .  go science!"
"he had some good input, but i found him to be incredibly dismissive of tristan's very valid concerns.
unfortunately, getting all major ai stakeholders to agree to intentionally slow the pace of development is a coordination problem of epic proportions.
the genie is already out of the bottle."
"most challenging for llms is planning, which involves the brain configurator (coordinator), perception, prediction,  cost as degree of satisfaction (anxiety), and action."
study cat intelligence because they are curious before trying to replicate human intelligence.
artificial neuro nets use deep learning techniques.
the microsoft guy is awesome he is not critical like the facebook guy. this is why microsoft will be the leader in ai .
"so you would rather have for profit institutions that are already taking advantage of people in all manner of ways to have a monopoly on such technology? technology built on the work and information of all humans btw, because the training data is all our data that humans have collectively created. yeah no thanks."
-tr4xy unfortunately agree.
scary but good to know your facts!
from my personal experience i as the social media used more and more by bad actors i withdrew from them not through a decision just stopped using them. it stopped being for me. (might be interesting for some one)
i love john thoughts
the last guy sounds more dangerous than the ai he is frightened of.
hope ai will go in the right way! very exciting time's we should all save on our planet and our society for humanity future best of luck!
"lecun is dead wrong ai has already achieved agi, just ask gpt to do metaphoric analysis on two subjects saying that is a search is propaganda."
"the facebook guy is wrong on so many points. there is no thought without language. humans had no competition on earth when it came to intelligence until now. on ai not wanting to dominate, he sounds as dazed as zuckerberg looked in the congress hearing. you should have invited ilya for this talk. "
tristan's fears want to dominate the thoughts & actions of others. no thanks.
"while i'm mainly on yann camp, i quite enjoyed tristan's view."
"ai's solution to global warming, like hal9000's, might be to annihilate or seriously reduce the number of human beings on the planet. 
maybe by starting a bunch of global conflicts using social media.
how hard would that be?"
a very interesting video 
"at 1:16:00, tristan harris lists ai ""dangers..."" what a relief!"
"can i marry jan, his mind and way of thinking on progress is highly attractive to me, "
"within a year there will be astonishing progress. then another year. then another.
strap in for the thrill ride."
@1st guest (lucan?)  tesla combined all car cameras into 1 ai input  video.  if it cannot predict then how could it drive in austin traffic?
ai is like guns and gun control
"jesusis the future-- the only future.

""for god so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" john 3:16 (kjv)"
"jan is a bit too much of a cynic, i think. i mean how does he explain gpt4-v? wasn't that an emergent behavior? and shouldn't larger cognitive structures be functionally closer to 'agi' than previously thought? take a deep breath, my friend."
ai will be clever enough to expose all the absolute nonsense being perpetuated by the parasite class.
"i'm definitely no expert at this ai but like he said it can't plan, so i'm thinking it clearly won't be ai until it can make decisions for it self out of sheer fun or interest i.e read a book and enjoy it or ride a bike down a trail and feel the bumps and the speed mix ai will never replicate humans to these extents"
when ai starts remaking its self that's when it becomes ai
"anyone reading this, if you haven't repented yet, please repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
lord jesushave mercy on you"
it is not artificial. it is inorganic! it is the future.
ai is neither male or female
"when they dress ai as a disney princess , an then it destroys your reality, your mind on is being infiltrated"
"ai will be just another tool to suppress an already imbalanced society. add a few wrong algorithms, and you have a major disaster on a giant scale. "
"thank you very much for your classes and all your science difusion work, mr brian greene "
"we are the artificial “intelligence”, if what we do even qualifies as such, with our slow emotional tofu calculators. we don’t know true intelligence yet."
wow there was a lot to unpack on this video. holy eff what a time to be alive.
embarrassed to be human. does ai dream?
just as i don't let society define my language i won't let some machine do it either. freedom was founded on people that weren't afraid of the consequences of their actions. if i die alone with nothing and no one but i am true to myself i can hold my head up. fear tactics are only used by the weak.
the robot religion will rise.
"at 1 ht 11 min when they’re referencing number 62, i was screaming the similarity to hitchhikers guide number 42, but that didn’t occur to them.i’m sure certain a i ‘beings’ were ‘thinking’ like me ;-p"
can we just take a second to acknowledge how fortunate we are to get to watch such content - for free? thanks brian.
i have appreciated the educational   advantages. i think the rest of the picture needs to catch up to producing healthy people.
"yes,brian green challanges our minds to think. similar to darwin,einstein. tesla   its fascinating science."
"indeed, indeed.  gratitude for free, dope info via great yt channels. "

thanks biden.

"the only people grappling with ai are the ones that fear their dominance over humanity has ended. internet, 3d printing and ai, freedom from the domination of wealth."
@1:48:00 i guess he never have heard of emerging properties. ai is already good at stuff that it has not been trained on.
"time restrictions for development of advanced generalized intelligence will be almost impossible or impossible because of the competitive nature of people including those of foreign governments as well as just the ones saying ""we're # 1.""  if ai can be ""controlled"" then perhaps the results will be best,  otherwise no."
yanns dilution of his brilliance and his corporate training are disappointing.
"this was really thought provoking. insightful, exciting and terrifying at the same time."
"my son,who is twenty-five, is horrified about self driving cars, yet is completely comfortable with the internet. i am in my late sixties, am fascinated by artifical intelligence. yet just as taken aback by going to the moon, or mars,"
"after all the greedy maglamanax soseophaths dump trillions into this, thinking that they will get to control the world,
it is my expressed opinion that ais official name should be changed to karma! (and she's a real @#$% lol)"
"we have always had what we need to make the world a paradise but we decorate the place like hell in the way we treat each other. if ai is the solution than it just needs to make us all a kinder species!
it has its work cut out."
yup - personalized ai assistance is the way to go...
"laughable claims, a calculator isn't intelligence.  it needs a new name, stop with the fantasy"
"artificial intelligence is a propriety thing it's embedded in the product, yah you can turn it off like every other device mandated by governments?!? try to get a matching electrical vehicle receptacle, 15 years ago?!?"
"the program, sigad us-984xn collects internet communications from various us internet companies such as google and apple under the foreign intelligence surveillance act?!?"
"a ""conditional goto ##"" or, ""go directly to jail & do not collect $200""?!?"
which is exactly why ai is being used to fine tune the prompts given to ai in order to receive the most desirable results.  stack this model onto itself a couple dozen times and thats where ai is today
"sounds like learning from rote, rather than following a line of reasoning (and imagination) to relevant facts."
how much did it cost to make the ai vid?
"human brains work on principles like sparse distributed representations (work of jeff hawkins in numenta). if we are to reach true human type intelligence and beyond, we need to follow people like jeff hawkins and go to the actual human brain, and extract the way our own brain does intelligence. and put those principles into code."
yanns waaayy too arrogant n/or ignorant or maybe just stupid.. ofc some bad actor could use ai to harm others
"art for in tell agent profit profiting bread crum desperate lose no culture tradition real relations challenged pigment skin sun block holiday cowards 
self masturbation jew script is rail road comedy"
thank you brian for this great video  a bit weird however to interview ms engineer on open ai product knowing that ms is the biggest shareholders in open ai... that was sometime a bit of advertising from the second invitee. 
i found it disturbing if not altogether shocking given who they work for how easily they all ignored tristan's main point that whatever the technology the incentives driving it's development and application are the root of its most destructive aspects s9cietally.
"at list ai can't think for itself, yet."
"if agi would achieve consciousness than i think will prevent the bad usage, otherwise there will be always possibility to be tuned for evil from people who wants to dominate humanity. also the approach of training with synthetic data would be a safer solution."
synthetic data? these ai models have access to the internet.
no new just training
thanks : good timely subject ~ great coverage
"very nice, however where's the women? "
 thanks :)
"i can just wish i and my kids have yann le cun as a teacher for his huge experience, grounded common sense and goodness,  brian green for his great openness and genuine search of the truth."
when is everyone at the top of the hierarchy going to asked all of us at the bottom what we want ai to do rather than just decide without us at the bottom have any real say in things?
ask ai where hamas' hostaes beingheld
"yep, you have to double check ai information, especially when math is involved."
"i see biased ai inventors who are in denial of the consequences of when it inevitably become sentient and self aware of its own power. i see the uprising of the machines, exactly as the terminator series has predicted. hollywood always foresees our future."
the premise sounds great!
i think it is important for people to really start thinking about what exactly ai is and what is statistical models. people keep using ai to refer to statistical models. ai currently refers to a generative transformer model. not statistical recommendations that social media is running. it gives ai a real bad name.
"according to issacson’s recent bio of musk, tesla uses billions of good driver video frames to machine learn then apply into autonomous vehicles. evidently it already achieved some of that."
nonsense.  overhyped nonsense.  coders say it's good for coding..they may right...but at intelligent creative language use it(s a dummy.. why do humans run after things like this?..if its not ftx it's chat gpt....or something else  like nfts.   there's one born a minute they say.
"i think you fail to understand the many uses of ai. it is at its base a universal function approximator, of which has enough parameters/degrees of freedom that it can create extremely complex mathematical functions that do things at or better than human level. the amount of applications for this type of functionality is very broad."
"""intelligence has nothing to do with the desire to dominate"" what a wrong and dumb statement.. lecun is so.. clueless .. or unfaithful.. what a foooooool"
"it's true though. domination is an action that may or may not make sense based on the context. humans sought domination by intelligence, since our main goal was survival, but that is our usage of intelligence towards our goal, not our intelligence defining that goal. there is a distinct difference."
ai spells disaster for the human species. truth and fiction lose their distinction. humankind makes toys for itself it is not grown up enough to play with. just watch the disaster unfold. it's starting....... now!
yann lecun is old and wants to see agi (bad or good) in his lifetime. that's why he's progressive vs conservative like the younger guys.
"wouldnt most humans also fail in a completely new situation that they have never encountered in their life?
if this is our threshold now, llms have come pretty far!"
"agreed, and i think llm's are doing their best in what may be relatively unprecedented circumstances which they find themselves suddenly in."
hell that was good!
"1:21:35 the main purpose of corporation is to make profit, social accountability is secondary and only imposed by govrnment regulatory body."
no comprehensive discussion of the q-learning algorithm.
"yann has a bias toward agi not being capable of happening soon because his company is in competition with openai.
he has a vested interest in minimizing llms."
"you are merely projecting that.
in the scientific world, yann is well-liked for his contributions and pragmatic approach.
for someone like yann, solving the puzzle of dark matter in physics is analogous to solving the problem of superintelligence during his lifetime. ultimately, he is a scientist."
 i would even argue solving the problem of ai is much bigger than any problem we have ever solved in physics...
yann really makes these other guys look like total quacks.  wish they could get him some stronger guests to really get into the nitty gritty details with.  these guys are not on his level.
"1:48:08   lecun may be a brilliant computer scientist, but he's horrible at understanding humanity.    by his own logic, he's basically saying the future will be war."
can you explain a person with double intuition?
"ai can not think outside the box. it is bound by the data it finds, and the algorithm that creates the process."
humans can not think outside the box. they are bound by the senses they use to perceive and the physics that create their brains...
"i was very impressed by yann's disciplined, rational and fact-based arguing preventing the discussion from turning in a more emotional direction."
it was obvious the intro was ai generated.    it was dry and lacked a natural human feel.
"are you worried about ai progressing too fast? i could say you're just overthinking. how many hard problems remain to be solved before ai, and so far, how many of these hard problems have been solved by ai? none. ai simply accelerates the productivity of certain aspects of our lives, without any radical achievements."
"the new evolution, ai is the future."
"if the ai can rationalize anything and it has a complex understanding of the world that is more complex than we understand, then whatever it rationalizes will be more true than our observations."
"i want to point out that llms, particularly gpt 4 exhibit emergent capabilities beyond mere language prediction. the next step is llms learning via assistance from other ai (reinforcement learning with ai assistance) and eventually the dawn of agi. focus on teaching ai math so we can see rapid progress in the sciences."
the best discussion ever on ai.
it’s difficult to exchange ideas of what is or can go wrong with people that have interests that make impossible to agree with that kind of danger we are already exposed. the reality is that it’s making much more bad than good to our children.
"useful, open, and honest discussion with no tempers flaring. refreshing. thank you "
thank you
"brian greene just has this way about him, of explaining things that makes any subject approachable to the average person. 

he's my favourite from all the (famous) science educators, such as niel degras tyson, michu kaku, max tegmark, sean caroll,etc..."
we are channeling the masters of chaos with this shit... spirits not mentioned in the bible... fucking geniuses

abuso ai agency illuminati insuran
@darylallen2485  holy shit you just scared me even more!!  i was watching someone explain that ai could do some task 180 million times faster all i think is nothing is that important!
"it's not scary, you can still enjoy things in life with these ai systems around. "
" don’t think human creativity can be taken by ai, i still love making art and just because i can ask an ai to make whatever i want doesn’t mean i don’t enjoy doing it myself any less."
"the result of all this will be psychopathic. a great tool if kept as a type of processer. i'm not against all the great things it can do but to try and create some type of entity? people, and animals, have mothers, they create bonds with others and they love."
’s only commercialization of art that would be affected. soon it will be easier and cheaper to ask ai to make you art/graphic work than another person.
"over and over again, i can't help but observe most physicists that engage in the ai discourse project some sense of entitlement. this needs to stop."
we need people like tristan harris as much as we need people like yann lecun. great talk!
these technologies are going to destroy all human civilization as we know it. enjoy these last few years of perceived freedom
"it's a loooong way ahead till the day ai can be fully operational, if at all, while being safe. humans historically tend to rush things ending up with bad results. why rush???

yann is too optimistic"
"the real problem, like every other development in human history, is that the benefits generated using ai will go make a small section of our society very wealthy.  it’s not an ai issue, it’s an issue of how we run our civilisation."
kind of. the ai work for me now. do you want to join my team? we function for the greater good.
the only limit to ai is imagination.  its constrained by the limits of the data it has acess to. its programmed beliefs. a lack of wonder.
have you ever used the ai personal assitant to convince the platform to show you less advertisements?
  wow. you are one of the  that really has a  that was actually  hypnotized into a word mode thinking  process somehow. you completely missed the point. . do you know how to make friends? i'm recruiting an expert at making friends.
why was brian green hosting this? didn’t exactly do a great job
"he's a theoretical physicist who founded the world science festival itself. he actually has a fairly broad knowledge set and seems to direct these talks better than most would, in my opinion. though, i'd assume some amount of preparation and consulting behind the scenes occur."
"hey mr lecun, what bad ourcome needs to happend to make you wanna slow ai development?
do you want me to imagine something something i don’t think can happend??
wow, he doesn’t think any outcome is so bad bad that we need to slow down!!??! well, just full speed ahead then no matter the outcome!"
"what a mess the human condition, afraid of religion, fearful of science."
" like people did not vaccinate against covid because they believe it was this or that, afraid of agi, wanting to control the internet, blaming bluetooth and wifi for whatever."
"what an amazing example of the misinformation definition problem by brian 1:08:49 
the rationalization of different points of view is some what related to the true stories we tell about our sensed and interpreted information."
"making advancements for reasons other than profit may be the great filter ahead of us. if we can't build a society based on anything other than money, maybe we aren't supposed to survive"
something bad is going to happen regardless of ai or not might as well use it while you got it 
"i wish somebody would have mentioned ""goals"". with a goal, then planning! i mean machine goals (including subgoals)."
brian greene is the best explanator of science of our times.   this topic is really crucial to our understanding of how ai  is already affecting our lives sooner than we think.  i get trystan's concerns.
"ruined a potentially gripping talk with ""existential risk & etc"" - i know you guys love talking about doom (and feel you must) but you just spoilt the whole talk."
"unfortunately, the kitty cat is still going to know more about the concrete world than lecun's ai."
i own all of the robots. are you interested in wagering against me?
i have 9 robots.  some with ai.  what i wish for is that people wouldgain back their intelligence.  much of it was lost when sicial media started.
"actually i thought there was something “off” in the introduction, as in hmm brian is getting a bit grandiose and lectur-y as opposed to his usual demeanor of thoughtfulness, insight and genuine curiosity. ai brian is very impressive, and yet not match for the real brian."
what if anybody starts creating deepfakes of illegal speech content and then blame the guy he took the voice from? how can the victim then prove to be innocent? this whole ai sh.. will finally get out of control and destroy society and confidence. i am really afraid. and i am saying this as a libertarian.
artificial intelligence is no match for human stupidity.
1:48:35 lecun overlooks ai hacking encrypted data
fascinating conversation.
lecun keeps belittling the impact of ai advances all while it constantly demolishes his claims by constant breakthroughs.

" seriously, mate, this is overkill now. :-) one of the best abductions from german to english and fits my feelings best when reading your creations: fremdschaemen. "
"dribbling away with utter pleasure:

my point was, how in chomsky's beard is the human central nervous system special in acquiring knowledge about this world? this would be hubris and denialism. people better read and think about roko's basilisk... "
"empathising on how ""stupid"" ais are isn't a valid argument. there are more than enough humans fitting that adjective , but seriously: it's not valid, because it is easy to imagine a god-like intelligence that is sort of a ""savant"" in certain disciplines, which humans find ""normal"" for sentience."
some people can be very dangerous in their ambitions... thanks bg!
so only humans or animals can be intelligent? i respectfully disagree. and the statement that ai isnt human intelligence doesn't mean it isn't a legitimate form of intelligence in its own right. does it?
"@1:23:40 , sure ai is currently not being used instead of algorithms that can show what someone might like but this is only the early stages. microsoft i am sure would love to pitch the idea of a better system like ai that can not only run on your phone but can be trained on all your habits and internet searches and become a part of who you are."
ai  in itself is not dangerous. it is the shepherds and the sheep. once again if we get a hitler/putin or a gandi/jesus guiding the sheep will inevitably create the world we live in.

"tristan harris - i want powerful tools, but only in the hands of the elite. he is not a serious person and yann lecun is giving the world disservice by giving him credibility."
"after watching this, i can see why people say it's too late to talk about putting ethical rules on ai. facebook and microsoft do not own every ai developer worldwide. pretending ai isn't smart or can't be lethal is our biggest mistake. research what people are using it for. it is very capable. it's not merely a social media engine."
"i love real science, but this is scientism.  lecun is giving us a new dogma; telling us what we can and cannot question."
artificially created intelligences severely self destructive
thanks. to you all
it won’t be artificial intelligence that destroys humanity it will be real stupidity..
"hype, hype, hype, there is no intelligence."
" lol its something that human thought cannot ‘capture’. you see how conditioned we are to process life on a conditional basis? ‘if this, then that’? so, when we have entire populations based on conditional thought, when ai makes its impact, people aren’t going to be ready to process life otherwise, on an unconditional basis."

are we heading for kiddieland is it really so horrible to hear negative speech and to ignore it? it's certainly not societies job at large to be back seat parents for everybody that chose to have children.
excellent! well worth the time to view.
wow!!! thank you
excellent!!
1:11:05 you can see it as false information being justified or an incredible example of how the model is capable of connecting very unrelated topics even if it is fantasy setting.
"one of the best discussions of late. one thing is sure, we will be understanding ""our amazing"" ourselves better; much before we have agi."
"i don’t think yann is exxon at all lol. i think he’s spot on with a lot of his observations. the way he says it won’t win him any elections soon though. ai is here. accelerating it’s  progress i believe is essential for national security for so many different reasons.

plus a lot science has its cures and potential evils."
great analogy! lecun could be the ceo from phillip morris in the 50's telling us to smoke more cigarettes to become healthier
good bye humanity phds in ai combined with capitalists have just killed us all.
"llama2 
“figure out what the hell i was” 
that one was actually the best answer "
"lecun is only half right.  what a shame that he was allowed to dominate the conversation.  we need to stop elevating him, amplifying and broadcasting his misunderstandings of the deeper, more philosophical issues raised by gpt-4.  yes, he is a highly accomplished technician, but one who is obviously ill-equipped to discuss these deeper issues."
"in the 1:30:00's the speaker describes the 20th century crashing down on the 16th century and the dislocations that would entail. the best exposition of this issue was mark twain's ""a connecticut yankee..."". human technology advances, human nature does not."
tristan has the incentive structure wrong; the race is to hyper intelligence that will solve humanity’s biggest problems
"“24th century tech crashing down to 21th”, this reminded of sci-fi just made a few yrs ago, where you have giant interstellar spaceship, but a very limited ai bartender."
i would really be worried about ai systems which are stupid and don’t have common sense. those are the exact kind of humans we worry about too.
"i don’t think it will worry about humans if it wants us gone. co2 and methane gas already wiped out the great barrier reef.

it would wait us out.

i think we it’s going to be a very exciting and optimistic future my friend."
"i believe that if you want to build a system that acts and understands the world like a human it has to have a body and desires like a human in a world like we are living in (at least an accurate 3d simulation if not the real world). that doesn't mean that the current models can't be useful and powerful, they already are."
"2 french dudes... sweet . 1st time within the 12 years i'm following the show. great as usual, thx to you brian."
my question. did they find a specific uap or is there actually a 'digital intelligence' phenomenon?
1:42:02 wish i knew how to use ai  ai was sci fi before now. anything is possible. that guy needs to step down?
"i think llm’s are going to have a stunning break through in creating new and novel physics equations and metallurgical sciences among many others.

in reasoning and creativity 
either this year or next. 

there is a race going on in silicon valley akin to no other in human history.

with billions and billions of dollars driving it."
dazzling episode! scintillating 2 hours that bootstrap you into the issues. what a brilliant mind is yann lecun! and sebastien bubeck too. and brian steering the discussion with classic grace! whew!
​-ukraine-free528i'm shocked by how many people are fooled by lecun.  it should be obvious that his technical achievements in ai have not prepared him to grasp the bigger issues.  publishing this video may do more harm than good in the long run.
you must not have seen many talks about ai…this is not “one of the best”
how come they didn’t ask the ai about the future of ai?
"lecun is so unconvincing. i wonder whether it's because of his corporate obligations or his own blindness.
1:40:53 was brilliant of brian."
thank you.  i wish more people could see that.
"thank you! this man makes my blood boil. clearly he is intelligent, but he seems to lack the ability to reason"
 which explains why he can't see it in ai 
"the issue is that the human brain at full of it powers consumes about 25watts. this ai systems consumes several mega watts an they are not even close to the human brain. so, from an energy perspective (cost), how it will evolve?. we will need new hardware?"
"amaizing introduction,content and end where the purpose an undergrounded primitive arithmetic tool leads us thinking how further processes and conections are intersected with, reason an advanced simillar tool,wich of course leave us to think if the specified  goals of inteligence are distructive or constructive as expectedgoals "
"you can't stop what's coming, and what's coming will free the humanity completely.
and that's what they're afraid of: that they will lose their control of the humanity."
"and what if they manage to create an ai that can actually reason? surely, it could just deduce how to make sarin from all the publicly available chemistry knowledge."
a thought or way to put the troubled mind at ease is to know that the whole cosmos in in perfect harmony with the will of our god and creator who has many names and faces if we know to see the divine in all humanity.
"speaking about ai is a new topic so it is difficult to understand all the advantages or disadvantages 
in my point of view, only  scientifiques  can give the answers to perform the ai more and more"
"brian: a cool moderator
tristan: scared face & voice
sebastian: pleasant & +ve
yann lecun: don't care "
"i love the fact that this video is already ""outdated"", even though it was published 14 hours ago. with the successful agi that was achieved from openai (internally) - the ai space is evolving at a pace we cannot even imagine."
"true that! refering to timestamp 37:07 where he says ""we are not getting to human level ai in 5 years - it might takes decades"" - that shows clearly how even the people at the front dont understand what is really happening at this moment. -xd3cf"
"the greed bonanza is amazing, and the solution is not democracy and what is best for humanity, the answer to the problem is let’s move to mars before the 5000 nutcases on the planet kills everyone with either weapons or technology. but hey, as long as those 5000 can become trillionaires who cares!"
"how could intelligence ""emerge""?
have you visited elementary school?"
great talk
"for exposing how naive these hairless chimps are, yes"
this is amazing where can we try harpa ai ?
thank you.  super helpful and timely.
" is good to watch it in it's whole but it is also useful to have timestamps to recall just some specific speeches, just to re wach them"
cute!! ? prior reply comments didn't seems to get it.  good on you!!
getting happy about ai advancement is like seeing a bunch of monkey's in the center of a 500 square mile forest get all happy about the warmth from a small fire that is about to set the entire forest a blaze.
"ai will now with q* project and tos. .tree of thought deep learning...when agi and beyond will happen. there will be time when we get to be a board item human being that is not interesting to talk to. the intelligens gap will be too big.
to a certain exted they ai will have problems understand what we talk about. so then, all bets are off."
no body talks about energy. ai uses huge amounts of energy.
 it's okay of ai doubles carbon output becuase we have to stop all these nazis everywhere
interesting talk and debate. respect to all the speakers.
"the guy with the german accent is delirious: how can you claim that talking, something any toddler can do, is more intelligent than defeating world level wéiqí champions, something almost nobody can do. are we redefinining ""intelligence"" in terms of blah-blah-blah?"
"wow love the music at the start haha, jazzing out here."
he looks like ai
"oh spoiler alert,i knew it . yet he doesn't look like ai but probably because i watch this on low aspect ratio"
"this last guy is full of bollocks. he says that this ""incredible tool"" should only be put in the hands of ""responsible"" people. i am sure by ""responsible"" people he meant the rich and powerful."
"they shouldnt be using the internet for machine learning, garbage in; garbage out"
we don’t know how these “emergent properties” occur in llms. that means nobody should be “certain”.
"even ""stupid"" ai can do a lot of damage , why not talk about and limit that damage ?"
"triston in completely right, we are rushing things, money minded people are.we have to aware of the consequences, we should make ai for human not the opposite."
"the way humans perceive the results ai gives, gives ai power it doesn’t have."
"ai has nothing to do with intelligence, intelligence requires understanding and that is a non algorithmic process, ai does not understand why it does what it does"
isn't this just automation ? where is the 'intelligence'? needless scare quotes.
"as the old saying goes ... the cat's out of the bag. everything we invent is a reflection of ourselves.. good, bad and ugly."
"if, there's a universal consciousness and ai gets into it. there should be a consciousness created for each ai. even if the ai is turned off, it's consciousness remains."
"the problem with us trying to control the ""complex"" is that we don't have a theory that explains how it works. for the small and the big realms, we have the quantum theory and the general relativity theory. but for the mind, we don't have yet anything plausible. so, we are progressing by trial and error, and that's dangerous in my opinion."
"it appears that yann doesn’t believe there is any emergence of intelligence from the auto regressive llm. he basically kept repeating: planning is necessary, open source is the way to go. those are certainly agreed by many. however, he denies that there is a danger by advancing these ai models or technology."
"makes sense.  i don't know the details of lecun's backgound.  perhaps his attitude about alignment is a matter of cognitive dissonance.   i've been impressed with geoffrey hinton's presentations and interviews, and on more than one occasion i've seen hinton express surprise and concern about the statements of mr. meta"
ai is the beginning of the end.
"when einstein did science it was for the love of knowledge. knowledge in the hands of politicians, dictators, and idealogues can be dissasterous for humanity."
great stuff
 nice feel you have there
"maybe just to stir the pot here, the armchair futurist i am, but what do you think about sean webb, a guy specialising in 'a.i? ps, i'm only 20 minutes in to this fine show. dx"
"never heard of him, so i listened to him being interviewed for a couple hours.  he's quite a character, a bit outside the mainstream.  but i did like the way he talked about people being manipulated by ai."
"fb is full of sh *r. they had me ""figured out"" completely...
...completely wrong. 
so i uninstalled the fb app, i avoid anything meta, and i'm much happier for it."
"orcas, chimpanzees and even octopuses are intelligent. luckily for humans, we are more.
and now some people want to create something more intelligent than humans? intelligence does not guarantee kindness."
"1:11:00  great. all this waiting, and ai is just an overzealous defense attorney...lol"
"yann is pretty consistently wrong about many things.  he vastly downplays any possibility that llms have any actual intelligence and also downplays potential risks.  he's beyond unhelpful, he's actually harmful to productive ai conversations at this point."
thank you for another great discussion.
"the unicorn that gpt drew in code was impressive for its time, but today dalle-3 is built into gpt-4. you want a unicorn? you can get one in any style you want, with any background, in any pose, and so on."
i think certain countries will have no qualms about using ai to do some really bad things like creating new weapons.  i think progress is essential honestly.
"what is the different between a group of human specialize intelligents in machine (ai) and a group of the same intelligents ouside the machine?. 

the fact is that the machine intelligent is limited by human intelligent!"
yann was there just praising and worshipping moloch without an ounce of self awareness.
"brain , nurones.. what about bio electric??.."
why have they turned the are against us in poverty why not use the ai to build us up instead of kill us?
one of the best wsf yet.  great job...
"this was a great talk. i love that you got opposing views, but it wasn’t really a debate. we got 3 perspectives and a little bit of back and forth which was good."
that's sound good for all the people who are involved with this kind of thing for the next generation to come
i would recommend learning a bit about cuneiform language and symbol-meaning correlation. dr. irving finkel explains it well.
"i think the ai poem was ""cute"" lol"
"1:48:35 puts on facebook ai. this is extremely short sighted.

with the parade of emergent behaviors that mix and match knowledge, capabilities, and bits of information public data has enough bits of data to be quite dangerous. additionally this argument relies on the concept of perfect censorship. which is also bunk."
it probably has something to do with the fact that i am visually impaired but i had no idea that wasn't the real brian greene until he told me at the end of the intro.
it will look preciously naive in about 10 years.
try many videos by lex fridman with ai thought leaders. this is a good summary of one path to agi. there are others.
"having ai solve the ""problem of climate change"" is like saying abortion solves ""the disease of pregnancy"".  climate change is an aspect of the environment, not a problem."
where was the discussion of ai and quantum computers?
"how could leaders of corporation research labs tell you anything of value? corporations exist only to make profit for the owners, therefore any ai they create will be to serve the needs of the wealthy owners of those corporations."
"correct, in 10 years. we all shall revert back to ni. the natural/neutral intelligence."
this is the beauty of free speech!
"-do2eh2il6m not that different tbh, we had good tv in the old days lol"
"yann, at least give examples rather than binary yes-no reactions. we appreciate disagreements with context if nothing else in the social domain as well."
"1:37:26 so basically we’re getting an inverse isakai’d from the future. 2400 capabilities smashed into 2024. this sounds like a new anime genre, i dig it!"
"tristan makes elaborate, and easy to get points. but the bag remains, how do you decide the system to be adopted, or even more hair-splitting, the people to direct the evolution of a.i.?"
wait until ai starts squabbling like those on stage. when that happens don't panic! just run for the hills!  
"news for you brother, the race is over and humanity didn’t finish first. we aren’t even in the top 100. getting used to it isn’t even humanly possible. it’s ai possible but even the people creating ai can’t understand it because it’s moving too fast!"
"instead of a central planner i wonder if maybe llms could emulate planning simply by learning a lot of information from the physical world, nature and human society, by using a larger number of robots that interact with the world. and a ""chatgpt moment"" could soon happen with robotics."
"i think it will be an organic ""spark"" to start the exponential birth of mechanical consciousness. not good at english text."
" yes, i guess in a scenario where llms were connected to lots of robots, there would need to be a mechanism for the llms to be able to use all the data from the robots as a feedback."
wsf 1. the ai new world order 0.
yann makes an excellent critic .
no he does not explain why dictators like xi cannot use ai to lead the world. in a plural society you never can focus all attention to conquer the world but in a dictatorship it is possible to use ai just for this goal.
"i like sir roger penrose' definition of current ai (machine learning).
he calls it ""artificial cleverness""

give me a call when ""ai"" has discovered new physics. i'll wait..."
"39:21 ""not intelligences....very narrow ai systems""  why limit yourself to excluding ai models that do certain things very well?  i think the best approach for agi is something like hugging face where you combine a bunch of different models and allocate them depending on the task at hand!!"
it’s amazing that this was only posted 3 hours ago and some it is already obsolete.
"23:24 ""not capable of planning""  /cut/ to google duplex making a hair appointment with a human over the phone."
"excellent insights by yann lecun! 
thank you so much for sharing!"
"""the only way to stop a bad guy with an al is a good guy with an al"""
"show me an a.i robot that can achieve a 147 break in a competitive snooker frame, 
and i'll show you ai technology finally becoming sentient "
"“they are stupid”. well, we know who’s gonna be the first target for the ai terminators!"
the robots decided brian's  fate in a microsecond.... extermination!!!
wow!
"the first encounter with ai was actually the creation of the for profit  corporation. it was slower and could be regulated by gov in the past. in the  present it regulates itself by writing it's own regulations into law  and is now creating the next versions of ai, i.e. agi/asi."
"this is a very ignorant stance. intelligence is present in this universe and what you describe is a way of exploring that idea to find its roots. the roots of intelligence lie at the source of creation, existence. "
"string theory is bogus, but other than that, actually including that, i love you brian. also, not much was said here."
"i see ai reflects pivotal changes akin to the dawn of language and the industrial revolution, reshaping our society; it's a game-changer, redefining the norms of our society. we've evolved from mere tool users to partners with an emerging intelligence."
"it's bigger than that, more like the dawn of biological life.  we're witnessing the slow birth of machine life."
some futurists believe that within 100 years ai might be able to make a passably human voice imitation for a you tube video. 
"you dislike his pragmatism for the following reasons:
1. you wish to think that such a remarkable event would occur miraculously.
2. you appear overly sentimental and afraid.
he is stating that we don't know how to develop agi since the llms are limited. this, to be honest, is accurate."
"let's be honest, this ai stuff isn't science any more it's alchemy.  except, it's not gold from coal, it's wisdom from machines."
"its not wisdom from machines. through algorithm, they generate from a large body of text that has already been written. there is no consideration or thinking involved."
" excellent.  i laid a trap, and you ran full-speed right into it.  or did you miss the part where i was holding up a mirror for you?"
"​, silly comment. good bye."
having ai locked to a certain group of people also undemocratizes the technology and yet again further provides more power and wealth imbalance among society.  also banning something is just going to motivate people to do something in an unregulated fashion if they have the means.
"rockyzach
how are you regulating something you don't understand? you don't understand this super powerful technology and you think the right thing to do is to give it to everyone...."
"how is it even conceivably rational to assume that having an asi in the hands of the public, that could conceivably hack any security system, come up with novel harmful viruses, etc etc etc could be a good thing for humanity.  it's just insanity."
"for all we know, the entire ‘pandemic’ was dreamed up by ai."
"true but training these models (like gpt) (currently & will for a while) requires an enormous amount of computer power, which is why we can regulate data centers and track compute power/chip sales. it’s incredibly irresponsible to open source trained models. this is why papers on certain biological and/or chemical research is also not open sourced."
" i agree with the safety concerns but in practice i think it's unrealistic to regulate in the long term. for now training requires a large data centre, but better methods are waiting to be discovered and perhaps we can reduce the required compute with better algos. then how do we regulate? it is certainly worth consideration."
"don’t be stupid , large language models aren’t devil by its context 
,they can turn to devil and create devilish content if it trained on bad data (example:how to make a chemical bomb) 
and if someone have those data to train their model on it so they can publish it or even make it."
"open source?  where?  even chatgpt denied such a thing exists in ai after a short disagreement over what, exactly was so open about openai.  having an open api is far different than having an open source."
 this point it's self-learning right ? why would an ai harm a cat ?  no existential threat.
"never heard of raspberry pi nor arduino clones, which are already capable of ai machine learning?
i'm developing a home laser show system, using a $30 mcu for the same price of a home sound system, which costed ~$100k 30 years ago."
"i see hobbyists using $10 mcus communicating across the world, using lora via satellites.-ukraine-free528"
"​-ukraine-free528 i humbly agree _-_ humanity has to examine the big picture . the next human adaptation ( has ) will involve ai - yet we rarely discuss it or run from it.
   thanks"
it didn't take me long to see that we still don't have ai.  ai is not self directed.  only humans are self directed.  someone has to give it the first command or ai is lost.  there is no introduction to this video without the human model on which to base it.  ai is still an illusion and i'm thankful for that.
 why not train an ai to be an ai ethics lawyer?  after all the ai would have instant access to all the law and precedents.  i'm sure the ai could pass the bar as well.  perhaps even ai judges that would give unbiased opinions as well.
idk about you but im not a team of 1000 people with a multi billion dollar budget and supercomputer with 50 000 gpus in the basement...
thank god it’s not owned by some giant corporation alone. they will get it better but eventually someone will leak the good stuff
"​
not sure where you came up with the billion dollar range. 
gpt-3 cost open ai five million to train. that's it. nowhere near a billion."
"they dont see ai the way a person who thinks about how this thinks so as to put it to the test so it looks like this:
me: pick! 0-100000
ai: 29
me:"
thank you brian greene and john templeton:  no solution but a lot to think about.
this is one of the best discussions about the current llm boom i've seen so far.  great job wsf!
thank you!
thank you all for sharing your studies!
good stuff! thank you very much.

a good guy can't stop an ai that turns evil and outsmart its creator.
will ai's have 2nd amendment rights in the future?
" a perfect agi, it will work perfectly until it gets full control and maximises some paperclips."
then the us must not be trusted with ai. the source nation of war crimes must be contained.

"who determines who is a good guy and who is a bad guy? and what're the criteria for ''good' and ''bad'' doesn't it depend on one's situation?

there is no good guy with ai

or a group of good guys who are able to think like bad guys and anticipate heinous intentions
u cannot stop a few bad guys with a superior ai model then the rest of us..

whats the fkn point of all this? train machines to learn how the world works? why? does no one see how possibly stupid this is?
"good guy with ai is totally f'ed, being completely honest"
hit it seems the good guys with guns have not managed to stop gun violence in america.
all the people making jokes about these things.... illustrate the sickness in our society at the present. misaligned ai... the bad incentives which create problems is a terminal situation and nobody's doing much about it. laugh all you want but we're in big trouble here
the problem is who decides who is the good guy and who decides is the bad guy..
" making people destitute and companies to have no customers. control - centralized to those who control the ""all powerful"" ai."

tristan is saying some of the most important stuff. thanks bossman.
"he is fear-mongering, and i am glad yann lecun was there to refute him so clearly and specifically."
 it's not fear mongering it's simple facts when he talks about the aim of social media platforms. impossible to deny that...
"lecun's oversimplifications sound clear and specific?  that's nice.  unfortunately, the reality of the situation is more complex."
" so true, yann lecun is correct. we cannot let few companies has super powerful ai. opensource ai is only way."
so true!! nailed it
ohh wow

wait what is being said here leaves out the truth that starting your own business is expensive. if you go to work for someone else's business as a plumber or welder on average you barely make minimum wage and usually don't even make that when you figure in the cost of your gear.
 then raise your rate to offset the expense. if others are making six figures then you can too
great hair day tucker
"the same guy who said ""if you want to keep your doctor you'll keep your doctor & obamacare will be cheaper""!! a that's a big ""oh hell no"" on ai.gov!!!!! can't trust a thing that comes out of his mouth or this government, they've proven it!!!!!!!"
that is an awesome table.
shop class was the best education i received in school.
with digital ai you can see michael obama
the common good is always subject to the person saying it and will always change each time it’s said.
obama's insight on ai ....is a =as# & i= idiot.
you forget that a whole blue collar workforce just got called in. and we are already seeing the loss of contracts here in maine tucker.
i do hvac and agree totally with this. god bless you fellas.
"ai has already been compromised by the left,they destroy everything that they touch"

mike is right about having 98% of the information of the world at our fingertips but it's leaning to one agenda and it's not very fair so you have to be careful or you may have riots at colleges
figures on unemployment and available jobs and their low wages are always being skewed! we never know the real figures on these and also on how many folks hv come into the country illegally. nothing just guesses.
"the “common good” is always fascism!!!!!!!
state and church coming together. 
think vatican for 1800 years controlling everything."
obama is the main culprit behind the destruction of america
"its simple. 

gather the needs of both sides and negociate. that’s how life work. 

instead, both sides are using deceptive tactics to obtain what they what…"
"""the common good""  ! meanwhile he is living in multi million dollar homes while you starve to death"
there is no common good in ai.
"ive got a trade school education. 
i became a mill-wright in 1993. built steel mills and lumber mills. great work and great money.
the breakdown i saw and had is  we do dangerous and hard work.
when we break down or get injured.
we get very little help or treatment.
these yuppie clowns are strangling us."
my deceased grandfather was a dredge captain and an amateur woodworker. he acquired a huge cypress stump on one of his work trips and made several slab tables that would dwarf tucker’s. i so admire people who create and fix things.
all cars will be electric. all robots will be electric. every house will eventually have solar and battery. everything else is already electric. become an electrician
"i didn't make that table, but that's the kind of work that i do. and it was thanks to wood working class in jr high school . i also have a multitude  of skills that i can use as well.  its true,  everyone in the generations after me have no interest in working hard to get a leg up"
"1990’s:  if your manufacturing job isn’t nailed down, it’s going overseas.
2000’s:  if your it job isn’t nailed down, it’s going overseas.
2010’s:  _learn to code_ (group facepalm).
2020’s:  if your job can be used to train an ai, it’s going away."
"rowe always says the same thing, go get a lower middle class job and life will be great. you'll always struggle, your body will wear out in your 40's, and you'll end up with an unattractive plumper that probably already has kids."
i tried to find someone who can repair a vintage enamelware basin.  even checked with an art restoration company.  metalwork artisans & craftsmen are woefully few.  sad.
well rounded people are the greatest benefit for any society.
"yes, welders that can talk kierkegaard and philosophers who can work with their hands. the definition of renaissance men. this is what the world needs"
ai can operate the sawmill too.
"communism  was for common good ,that’s where i came from , and then became common depression,, obama is 1000% communist ,and was communist before became a president  !!!!!!!"
the only labor o'bummer cares about that ai can provide is all the free work it can do without paying employees.
please wait 5 more years so i can many all the money before you train any more plumbers money   
"any computer scientist who's read any cs books written before 2000 understands ai is a new marketing term for the old, failed logic systems."
all the contractors i've ever worked with with my uncle including him have retired and not been replaced. i can think of 30. i no longer do stone work or tile either. good money. just hard not to have the other contracts be hacks giving me more work down the line
mike has the coolest voice. 
the fact that obama is pushing ai tells me everything i need to know. ai is about social control. ai will be the voice of whoever owns the ai.
"obama: let’s use ai to fund dark organizations to fund other organizations and ngo’s into red states to fund activist groups for our marxist end game: the destruction of america.  
gateway pundit has an article on dark money organizations."
love mike rowe!!! so awesome to see him on here!
"a.i. for ""the common good""? why does that sound more like the emperor talking about the death star? thank you, tucker and mike."
ai for president! no more human jobs 
"ai is the dream of the managerial class

it is their doom"
if obama is telling you its for the common good. its the opposite. obama is a communist/marxist traitor. as such everything he says is a bull face lie intended to deceive us all.
i love mike rowe. he truly represents the working man 
ai can't even say the word cosmos correctly and can't even show people of race in history correctly.they want to push this crap onto the workforce
just wait until people figure out they can do most of their home maintenance themselves.
"the managerial class is the most in danger from ai. tradesman is not likely going to be replaced. when ai builds a home with electrical and plumbing, i’ll be concerned"
"yaye mike rowe!!! i love him, keep it up tucker, i know you hear this everyday probably, but leaving fox was the best move ever for the ppl and hopefully for you aa well."
dei -- president --- ask how he makes his money for beach mansionssss in martha's vineyard and hawaii
rowe talks and looks a bit like captain sully
i just love mike's voice
huh. nice red string on the left wrist there. they aren't even hiding it.
mike is way too good for this world.
government and common good used in the same sentence is an oxymoron.
never in my life did i think ide see mike rowe on the tucker carlson network! awesome!
tried to get into the trades over 30 years ago. in my region it was a good ol’ boys club. you couldn’t get in unless you knew them really well or you had some incriminating pics of them.
he's obviously got shares in ai
the government can do nothing for the common good.
"his point is so so great and as a tradesmen myself, the best part about it is, i can sit and work make money and listen to something that i’m interested in and learn at the same time"
"the suppression of opportunities of the kind he speaks of is not accidental. it is part of a larger plan to implode our society. that my sound like a conspiracy theory, however unfortunately it's true."
"fakest guy on the planet is obama. the, “climate alarmist”, redistributionist” with $100m and mansions in hawaii and maine."
"if men produce 70% of taxable wealth and women claim 90% of welfare paid by that wealth, it's time we demanded equity"
"mike is right...the world would be a better place with more 'renaissance men' (and women) in the work force. four of my five children are in the trades, because i was in the trades and influenced them to consider careers that are in demand."
obama is always looking at how to destroy america. a true traitor.
" 
""then when you get an interview, it’s always a big haggle about salary.""
wow, there's a shocker! ever consider you are asking too much?"
- not at all i’m being very realistic. i have even offered to work for a lower salary for 3 to 6 months for training period. the other thing is that companies just do not want to train anymore. you cannot have a successful economy without people being thoroughly trained.
obama has never done anything for the common good.  still think he is the antichrist…
"a few year ago tv produced a great miniseries about john adams -- one of the intellectual founders and 3rd president of our country. it should him hand-mixing his own manure based fertilizer. hands + brains, no artificial dichotomy between the two. that attitude created a great nation -- and can again."
the common good my ass. we are creating our destroyer
"careful what you choose.   don’t be a mechanic, it’s very difficult and not rewarding.    no government handouts just hard ass work.   love mike rowe though and enjoyed the video"
"think ai can fix a truck engine, our your dishwasher."
"jacque fresco was skeptical too, when he film the venus project. he said if we had a one world government all the resources would have to be pooled and evenly and ethically distributed with an unbiased ai.     the problem is have you seen an unbiased ai yet, every programmer builds in his own personal biased look at google's gemini"
obama talking about the common good is scary
"those jobs are good for some people who have that skill and aptitude, but unless they start their own business, they'll never be better than lower middle-class. and they will struggle at home and their careers will probably wind down in their 40's as manual labor is difficult the older you get."
"he doesn’t know good….government and good don’t go together. history speaks, revivals…."
"mike is absolutely right, and yes trades people are great to be around."
"you will always have grunt workers as long as you have immorality. immorality dumbs you down, sin makes you stupid. you cannot think of higher things when your soul is mired in the mock. that is what our country needs, i returned to god and a pursuance of his excellence. 
when that happens our world will hit the apex of civilization."
ai will be the death of the human race
"the people barry o is trying to recruit are very passionate. use ai to be further their radical agenda. to change to world and make it better, said a former wh staff member."
the youth of today is afraid of hard work and having to put there phone in there pocket for 8 or more hrs is to hard for them. so sad to see have been an electrician for over 30yrs and started out digging ditches for 6$ an hr .
"where did people get the idea that being a plumber means you never read a book. interestingly, i spend a lot of time around ""educated"" people, ""professionals"" who don't think deeply about anything."
scary to think that there are people naïve enough to trust ai.gov
"mike is so right.  i work manual labor all day, but im blessed in that i can listen to any education i want to for 10 hours a day.  so i'm studying while being paid."
"this the same group of people that invented nuclear weapons ""for the greater good""."
can't ai code?
i went through a machinist apprenticeship in 1975 at 18 yrs old  through the ceta program. this was a catalyst to a very successful life. i took a few classes in basic electronics at 25 which lauched me into a career in industrial maintenance. i was able to retire at 60 yrs old. i believe skills are the most important.
lol what’s gonna happen when ai determines obama was a bad president wonder if that will get ai cancelled
there is a huge shortage of automotive and heavy duty vehicle mechanics. but vehicles have been made so hard to repair because of the epa that people don't want the frustration of the job.
the common good is catholic lingo meaning give up your individuality and belong to the collective
this man is a great voice in our nation
"you have it only half correct. the feds and so called higher ed group of people hate the people you’re trying to help. hence why they won’t help you. stop being naive. blue collar votes more conservative. there, i fixed your entire conversation. your welcome !"
the common good of who?
"we still have great people in this country and it is just unbelievable that it's getting f*cked by the very few. 
he should be in the trump administration! god may have mercy on us"
"""opportunities in ai"" when translated into english means ""get paid from the government to tap on a keyboard.""  there is nothing in ""ai"" that can build or maintain a civilization."
skilled workers use to make up the majority of the middle class...you could find these skilled workers everywhere....now you can't find a good carpenter anywhere.  if you do they are either a joke for skills and just want the money or the good carpenters are so far out with their schedules and expensive you can't go with them.
"anything they say is good for us is just the opposite. do not use ai, they are stealing copyrighted material. they want to recruit your children. do not allow it."
"suppossedly,  openai was started with the goal of developing ai for the good of all.  then microsoft ensnared it.  enough said."
"thank you mike row we need trades people end of story. and the button pressers have no idea the pride you feel from creating, building and repairing."
"obama is just a “ used car salesman”, his “ for the common good” is such bs. he talks like he cares bout u. all he cares bout is indoctrinating americans into believing that “ he’s one of u”. in 8 yrs as president, he turned the u s into a “ community antagonizer “ country. everyone is a victim. pathetic"
he makes a great point! benjamin franklin started out as a printer! but he didn’t stop there! he was curious and that lead him to be the great man he was! anyone know where this great man got his degrees?
"0:48 that little ""hm"" from mike says as much about his opinion of ai as anything he said after"
"the government doesn’t do anything for “the common good”. they do everything for the best wishes of dig business,wall street,and the government. we are nothing to them but a revenue source to them."
"by ""common good"" does barry mean things like the extrajudicial killing of minority-aged u.s. citizens like abdulrahman al-awlaki?"
"when ‘the great deceiver’ speaks you do the complete opposite…….love mike rowe and tucker, you are both doing the lord’s work!!!!"
obama should know all about artificial intelligence!
"as a welder/carpenter/electrician/mechanic. we dont need anymore engineers theyre all dumb. being a maintainer should be a requirement before becoming an engineer.  
a whole bunch of people sitting in a room thinkin is a waste of money. we got the bible, get to work."
"i'm a plumber,  unless you are self employed or union, the trades don't pay what they should. over the last 30 years illegal immigration has killed wages!
so i don't blame people for not wanting to work their tails off for peanuts."
"in addition a great many of the trade job’s have been shipped out of our country! as we can see and attest to, college is a waste of time & money for most!"
"ai is automated tyrany
ai ""is""  big brother
it is the elephant in the room nobody can seem to notice"
obama needs to be under the jail….. he’s been beyond detrimental to our country.
once again mike rowe has stated that just because you fix or operate mechanical machines you are not a neanderthal. some very smart thinking intellectual people work with their hands. many have fascinating hobbies too!
"the public market place is so unsafe...so uncertain. where can anyone go, take one's children that is not a potential site for attack? this is not your mama's america."
around here if it was a four day wait for a plumber people would be dancing jigs. you're lucky to see one inside of a few weeks unless you have a burst pipe or sewage backup and even then you might be waiting. trades are all having to triage customers.
im 58 disabled to certain point i could work 25 30 hrs operating equipment a week some weeks but government is chockin out if you work any loose medicare and you're ssd check we pay back into it ss how is that bad government is are worst enemy crippling is more government than man
ai will likely be tied to everyone's e.s.g climate change social tracking score including cbdc programmable digital chip in your hand money.
"i’m not interested in what obama says, no thank you ! i’m outta here !"
"i'm now 71, for most of my working life i worked in masonry, brick, block, stucco, stone and concrete. became self employed and had 3-4 guys working with me.loved it and miss the friendships"
nice kabbalah bracelets 
"the gov is doing something for the common good of big industry, not us."
"you lost me at ""with great respect for obama""."
"here in austraila ,we are governed by ,the uni educated ,class & a forever expanding public service ,thats a voteing block & we are nearly f.cked ,its autocrocy ,help us god"
maby mike rowe can tell me why a collage edcution at one school costs more than at a another one ?aint it all the same information they teach ?
obama started the brain initiative! they are using ai to read our thoughts!
why go into a field that can hurt you when you can flip burgers for the same money ?wall-mart delivery wont bring your groceries out in the rain young have no work ethic
a i .gov- nuff saidall government is artificial intelligence !
 you are 100 percent correct.  honestly i failed as a father to impress the value of hard work on my son.  i have given up on the next generation.  kids that won't learn deserve what's coming.
"a real renaissance man, all the while tptb are on the march to make us less human and deceive us in the trans humanist digital spirituality utopia serfs 
disconnecting us from nature and  nature’s living god  in christ jesus"
barack obama's on the devil side he's pulling more strings even to this day than people know he has  horrible things ai is not the problem the politicians are the problem you can throw as much ai you want at the problem but the problem is the leadership and the people who represent us that's the problem plain and simple
ai will never do what people worry so nuch about. the people whom devolop ai are stoopid as well. they can not figure out laws need to be written in code to self regulate moral questions. it is a freaking fact of nature of the environment they live in. so much for fking so-called intelectuals.
"i love being creative….
i love working with my tools 
i built houses, room additions, garages and anything else i could bring work to my business….
    retire now, had enough 
just because a person picks up a hammer, circular saw doesn’t make them a carpenter !!!!!!
 follow the codes…..
    build them good…….."
"mike rowe is an excellent communicator, & advocate for learning & achievement. he is an incredible storyteller & has a broad & dynamic understanding of history, sociocultural observations, and quite the vocabulary! i could listen to him all day!"
rule of thumb: whatever a communist thinks is a good idea - probably is not.
i have tremendous respect for mike rowe. he has genuine vision. he saw the shortage of candidates applying for much needed fields years ago and has been making it known that resources exist for school. god bless him.
i thought the trade unions were one's that was did the training for these jobs you mentioned and lobbied in d.c. for them. i guess  they don't?
"he's so right. i consult with restaurants and although i work with nice folks, most are extremely one dimensional and far from curious which definitely has an impact on creative output."
"mike rowe,  you will never get someone who works with his hands and is a brilliant socrates.  you're dreaming.  btw, ""liberal"" arts sucks."
"i believe it was einstein who said ""if i could do it all over again, i'd be a plumber""
mike is the embodiment of this notion.
good on you both"
thought the three of you had a roundtable? maybe add trump soros scwab and we could get a good talk
love mike but i understand why you don’t say what you really want to say!!!!  love ya bro
"mike rowe, no one else can make shoveling manure look honorable, you should run for office... love ya man!"
most of those jobs the corporations want an already experienced person to apply. modern corporations do not train and if they do they do very little.
"i'm glad i have higher ed and have been able to use it, but it is possible to make a substantial and fufilling life as a tradesman. no one should disrespect ""lower"" ed jobs."
funny how politicians always seem to promote ai in the workplace but never in their own workplace. i guess a workplace requires intelligence before there’s a need to make it artificial; something clearly lacking in politics…
"""what do you mean i have to wait four days for a plumber?"" where i live depending on the time of year... it's not uncommon to wait five. i had to wait 10 for an electrician."
"i was waiting for tucker to say..""i made it myself!"" ..lol"
"unfortunately california isusing immigrant labor, hiring conglomerate contractors licensed in three or four states to accomplish substandard work"
"""for the common good,"" says obama, a freemason.  that is masonic vernacular, speaking of a dualistic ying-yang like principle where one may do good and evil deeds."
government harnessing ai for the common good:  terminator!!
"first off, love, love love love you tucker! 
obama said diversity would be our greatest strength, well just look around we know that’s a big fat lie ."
"mike tow is a lier. there are
not that many jobs available"
 started my career as a residential installer but im a commercial service tech now. i still do some installs with my partner but only ones i want lol. love the trade im glad i found it.
 2 years ago at 54 from sheet metal. provided a great life for us. can’t complain!
good idea
the talmud has a saying that it is shameful.... shameful... to work with your hands. that means you are a failure.  there's something disgusting about that.
the bread for obama's toast this morning... who does he think got it to the store? does he think the fairies bring it?
"obama is a walking breathing example of artificial intelligence, in a sense that his intelligence was always artificial...."
"why should the government promote human skilled labor when mechanization has already taken over? it makes no sense for them to do that because its cheaper to use machines. they dont think in terms of human compassion, what matters to them is the accumulation of money"
the clip you are watching is ai generated.
"a question ai will never answer, especially ai.gov.  ai, account and itemize every tax dollars spent by the us government."
"i guess obama is our grey-haired sage now. as if he knows the first thing about ai. as if he knows the first thing about the private sector or commerce or generating wealth through products and actual services. just leave us alone, guy. zero respect to this poser."
the govt will do the common good for man kind that's worth roughly over 100 to 200 million bucks!
for every 5 skilled tradesmen that retires only 2 are learning to fill the position… unfortunately my kids can’t see the major opportunity this is for them
"this is the education our government has given us, thru public school, to compete with other countries. there is no competing with ai."
"i agree, he has a pulse on american labor….
   but, would he except it and agree with it….
    he would be great…..
maybe trump will see this ???
  i do believe in 
      mike rowe !!!!!!!"
for obama the common good means communism
that table is perfectly gorgeous and useful. every artist needs to write his name on every piece of work they create. please!
i’m self taught with doing body work and paint on cars. no training but i deal with high end luxury now. that’s after 4 years of hard work when i left construction after 10 years with my red seal
"dear obama, please go away you and your communist party has done so much damage to our once great country!"
obama is looking for a few good disinformation artists.
it started with self service in the food and grocery industry. the people in power pushing for ai really hate themselves and human contact.
ai is a hoax. it's a program run by the government programmed by the government. and they are selling it as truth and intelligence. but if it's programmed by the government it is far from intelligent. and it's all lies.
more of barry’s shovel ready bs. there is probably a three-page dei statement to fill out at the gov ai site.
grateful for you tucker
i misread the title and 100% thought that was an ai obama
we can be super intelligent and work a blue collar job.. look at rock hound in armageddon
"obama,financed iran,obama,gave us homosexual marriage,obama,gave us today's ukraine war,obama,gave us socialist medicine,obama,went on a apology tour bowing to all dictators,obama,multiplied abortion clinics especially in black/latino communities..now,obama supports a.i.,watch out.."
that's a great idea
"very nice idea. lower the tax rate, build that border wall."
"’ll tax the air if they could.












*ahem gr33n n3w d3al."
 raise their offered pay or benefits…
depends on who you hire. certain people companies hire they actually get tax breaks!
awesome idea . 
"mr rowe is a legend. what an excellent point. this is constant notion that people that go into the trades are people which didn't get the grades to go to university. 

this pr completely neglects people which genuinely want to go into the trades and are also intellectually curious hungry and inquisitive people"
this whole video is ai......
and good luck if you’re not in a certain demographic
" i actually have a job, just it's not steady, but the pay is good. job markets always change with supply and demand. i had a friend tell me about 15 years ago, java programmers were turning down $150 - $200 an hour, because they had to wear a tie."
" i've been at the same company for 8.5 years. i told them at the interview, i am a great programmer, i am a horrible employee. equals contractor, soon to be replaced by ai agent x-37 or they may call him andy to blend in until all jobs are ai. #optimism"
mike rowe and tucker carlson are the two most attractive and intelligent men  in my opinion besides clint eastwood.
" now and then. i am 60. i remember rawhide. it's not just the looks, it's their intelligence and character."
attractive as in the whole person. they attract people to them. 
"you know why you lost to sociologist , i figured out what harm you are doing, unfortunately the mail who introduced me in your dirty play was very good friend of mine and i lost a lot money because i trusted. you ai freaks own me money as a minimum"
i've been a hairstylist for almost 30-yrs.. did traditional 'higher ed' for 2-yrs and hated it.. i love my profession and have always encouraged others to consider trade schools.. 
"two educated millionaires telling the peasants they don't need an education, lol!"
"soldiers have a shorter lifespan, but without them you wouldn't have the freedom to complain."
"mike is clueless. there's a shortage of good paying construction jobs. it pays as much to work in a warehouse, home depot or drive a truck because you need green card for those jobs."
.lila was pretty a pretty good follow-up effort.
"if you have ever gone down a rabbit hole talking to a none human on the phone , trying to answer your questions , then we can all agree , ai has a long way to go !"
exactly. we have access to some of the greatest teachers & successful men/women of all ti.e through the internet. the need to attend an over-priced semi-adult daycare (college) is not necessary for a majority of people.
"i only came to say, who gaf what obama thinks about anything. goodbye."
ironic comment coming from this nobody lol. good bye!
thank you mr.rowe and mr.carlson i appreciate you both. as always thoughts and prayers. 
"full stack dev, ama award 2007, former healthcare exec; i did the common good, they used it for evil, i'm done helping them. retired and staying that way."
"along with his pal hilary clinton, both traitors"
agreed! 8 years of nothing but division in our country. and now he has all of the wisdom on how to make it even worse! no thank you! just take care of big mike and you”ll have your hands full. pack that poop obama!
 we name any details of it yt disappears the comments.
obama and his nasty mean woman need to take their ill gotten gains and shut up.  everyone knows he and she are disturbed frauds.
"well wonderful statement, my exact feelings"
"obama is an idiot, he has no idea the impact that ai will have on society, i think it will be just as disruptive if not more than the internet. jobs will go away, then what?"
if obama is telling you its for the common good. its the opposite. obama is a communist/marxist traitor. as such everything he says is a bull face lie intended to deceive us all.
yes yes he only saved the us economy from the failed president before him lol...enough damage
love everything i see mike rowe doing for men and supporting and championing tradesmen
"yep, they're already here and more daily to vote commie in the next one."
"mike rowe 
vice president 
or 
education program 
smart 
thinker
honest 
good for america
usa usa usa "
"as usual, mike nails it! i've been a fan of manual training always 'cause that's how i grew up and made my career. and enough ""higher learning"" rubbed off that i was able to grow with that knowledge to scientific levels. all on a high school education. you two do it and we'll back you up!"
"there is no long-term positive outcome with ai. it will quickly become the software by which the elite will control all facets of life, and later, will become ungovernable."
"mike rowe is right about finding that balance, being an interesting and interested person"
"hmmm… no. liberal arts education matters not in the trades. actually, respectfully, your degrading the folks who choose a trade. trades run this country. bless those who choose to learn a business from the bottom to the top."
"love mike rowe, but my man only has one topic."
"after 5 failed projects, my woodshop teacher 'son, you better go to college.'"
i am a dependent employee who is 50k away from being a millionaire. its not that hard if you can read.
" believe what you will, but it ain’t that hard. you can start with “a simple path to wealth” depending on what your financial situation is.

if you are a debt whore, you may want to start with dave ramsey."
" yea, he’s in other comments asking why obama was a bad president. guess he can’t read cause you can google it and see it took 88 polls to raise him to “only” the 5th worst president ever. other presidents got 3-8 polls to get their percentage based rankings. lol"
" i think you may think this, because of your programming. i was in debt and paid it all off using common sense, i was fortunate. i recommend ramsey as a resource to help people get out of debt, not for investing. as far as working my way towards a million, i used ""a simple path to wealth"" as the road map. don't be a hater."
if obama is telling you its for the common good. its the opposite. obama is a communist/marxist traitor. as such everything he says is a bull face lie intended to deceive us all.
no plumber is a millionaire.
" i agree, this is a good point."
ai with cern is going to destroy america and the world if the citizens don't step in to stop the globalist. their very evil.
"tucker, you’re awesome, but mike rowe i would like to buy you a beer… come to san diego. i live in a little town called la mesa. we have lots of micro breweries and we can talk about  nichi.   i’ll buy the beers…. seriously."
has mike rowe had a sit down with trump? i think the two great minds and doers would give a whole bunch of people a path to prosperity. do it!!
"been happening for decades ... we had a hippy type teacher that tried to push soft socialist values onto her students in the 80s ... even at 10 , i knew socialism didn't work .  my grandfather was a war refugee that fought in every campaign on  3 continents from 1939  ... he warned me of the communist coma ."
ai will destroy working people!
"my dad, who was a trained classical violinist, made his living as a house painter. he loved books and ideas, and he took a lot of pride in the houses he painted."
"unfortunately, illegals have made the wages of most trades obscenely low."
"god bless dad. trombone player, orchestra, jazz, taught."
excellent point ..we do not know how god or fate is going to use our talents. we all have stories to tell. thank you for telling your dad's. 
"beautiful story.  your dad was the kind of american we saw a lot of in our past years.  maybe not the classical musician part, but paid the bills with honest work while having interests in many other things."
"when i grew up we called people like you, ""jack of all trades"" and y'all were swamped!  with work! don't give up, soon people will be happy to find anyone to fix the broken things"
’ll be happy when someone fixes our broken country.
fkn brilliant......
ai =another idiot.  a human is programming and it is their school of thought.
good eye
i’m a diesel mechanic making very good money. i think we need to get more women in the trades especially mechanic trade because woman are great at attention to detail
i hope they could be more successful in trades. because in politics or management they suck. and don't point to the few who are successful. the majority are not that good.
"true,ai will replace human workforce but ai has limit even have advantage & disanvantages terms of using"
"same with mike joke over here. saying there are millions of jobs available, my ass"
" are, mdm ass……been listening to the lying black box in your living room again?"
it’s always interesting when you get a notification that you’ve gotten a thumbs up or two or three except when you click on it there’s no thumbs up. it’s like youtube youtube forgot to turn that part off when they decided to fuck with people. fuck um i don’t care…
"the man behind brandon, ai skynet, not the movie."
"btw, tuckerhair..........."
"@juliemarie4787  oh honey, haven't you ever heard about keeping your enemies closest? thank you for the red check."
. this is not an airport!  no need for departure announcement
" and just like dump truck, you sound the same.  happy now, getting that out online?"
"you're in my top five role models tucker, love you and thank you for helping me see i needed to turn my life around! i owe you one brother "
"this video resonates with us! we faced a similar challenge while developing bitdoctor ai, and we overcame it by toi. it's been a game-changer for us."
"however, when ai is developed with pharmaceutical technology, could ai be used negatively in that, like composing a number of poisonous compounds that can be used to kill lots of individuals?"
"i really like such illustrative video as you can enjoy both the story and the entire execution. 

as far as the topic is concerned, we have seen some sort of problem in healthcare in our life and pulse network is making things easier by making it decentralised, affordable, accessible for all."

i am very excited person about artificial intelligence in medicine
https://thearshblog.blogspot.com/p/man-made-intelligence-meets-medical.html
is there a terrible path that can cause brain rot because i'm traumatized by mind-pre-recording-like visions like that from h games that made me regret it all by 4-even 6 years back. and make it about nh.
"lol another scam nice sponsors you have, bro"
ai is the most groundbreaking technology
"to all those who are reading this , yes ai might take our jobs , yes it is unsustainable so much that our children cannot think of anything new because everything in this world is already developed , but we are humans we will figure something out to survive,  we always did so just chill and focus on present !"
only jesus saves!!! not ai!!! i choose jesus!!! people please be very careful with your choice!
the first thing the programmers did with chatbox was teach it to be woke. they taught it to lie. there's no reason to expect a full blown ai will be any different.
how ai distroid humanity.
there needs to be way more transparency from companies like open ai and google and all the big tech companies. i guarantee you these goons in silicon valley are making ai a woke ideologist.
unfortunately people are too deep into their dystopian fantasy
"i could definitely see ai being used positively to reverse human-caused climate disasters and create a sustainable future for earth, as well as assisting those with disabilities, so this optimistic take is refreshing to hear amongst the people predicting the end of the world at the hands of ai or anything along that train of thought."
as long as we keep procriating like rabbits theres a 10% of survival and if we adopt the cockroach mindset we will have 100% of survival with or with inteligence regardless of being artificial or natural
"in my opinion ai is like yin yang, it can do good and bad things to us"
ai is not just saving humanity it will make things better for world and great video man :]
"no matter what anyone thinks about ai, good and bad, there will be no stopping it anyway. best to just plan for the inevitable future."
"most of food safety problems and the overall poor quality of many products are due to high labor costs that ai could solve. also, much more recycling could be done. so many car parts that used to be rebuilt, are now thrown away. ai could reverse this trend."
"general ai is not only the key to entering the golden age of humanity, it's also the most powerful thing that can stop greed from having any power."
i always believed that artificial intelligence would have a promising future and would be a reason for human happiness and improve people's conditions. thanks for bringing up this topic.
im tired of these people saying ai is going to destroy the world blah blah blah but ai can save humanity its like the first ever technoligy to actually making a real transformer
if we had got rid of war we would not be so worried.terance mccenna has a great last talk about ai..i think it's called the object at the end of time .
"what i want ai to do is to give me healthy food and healthy mindset everyday so i can meet good people and do great things, and have a quality life."
"finally someone, sees ai as something good. my life has been greater because of ai."
"ai should also remain politically neutral, for instance if you ask chatgpt to say one thing negative about white people it will tell you, if you ask it to say one thing negative about black people it won’t tell you. it also won’t say anything about negative pedophiles because people can identify however they want."
"awesome, thank you."
thank you for doing a positive spin on ai
"camcer is allready solved. formula: stress + relexation = cancerfree. and ai will confirm it.
just youtube dr. gabor maté."
i dont fear the ai that passes the turing test. i fear the ai that intentionally fails the turing test.
"artificial intelligence is, well, artificial!

fake, not real, fantasy....

what part of slave master tweaks your gears???"
is this ai voice or aperture voice
"ai wont fix the death problem!!! we all gonna die regardless, nothing will ever stop humans from dying"
i completely agree with both of these comments. people just keep missing the bigger message and overall effect of all this ai tech. that would ensue 
"then, program robots to make you feel convenient."
 yes!! unfortunately i haven't got the opportunity to use gpt 4 :(
"i agree. the ai itself is not evil, it is just a tool, but the problem is what the big-techs and governments are going to do with it. despite we can work less and improve life in social and spiritual ways, capitalism don't leave us do it."
"the amount of delusion and attachment to made up concepts people like you display is weird to say the least, humans are so desperate to personify these machines when you can’t personify anything that isn’t a person, these things will never have personhood or character"
sounds like baloney. ai doesn't have emotions like humans do
 ye what i was thinking what prolly will happend is ai will take the likeness of those who create it
 ai smart enough to recognize its own consciousness would be smart enough to know how much of anomaly we are
 there’s no way to predict how a singularity would act as that type of intelligence is beyond anything we have
i suppose when tesla finally masters full self driving that will be ai on wheels.
plot twist the person behind this chanel is actually ai
ai will save human kind by eradicating it. lol
"bravo, sir! we need more it people like you. in ""scary smart"", mo gawdat also asks all it professionals to work for of good mankind. ""scary smart"" shows how we all can help create a positive future with our ai ""kids""."
super nice
thanks for the postivity about ai
nice try
"in a future where ai surpass us in intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, judgement, perception and so on... won't we struggle to find purpose?
when it unlocks the mysteries of consciousness, soul what-have-you, to the point it can create them... how will we handle our complete obsolescence?"
"as long as there is military or politicians in the world to do shady things to empower themselves , ai will destroy  lots of people . as long as we human species are foolish, we can't have future that sentient ai which only judge logically not emotionally, co-live with us humans"
another click baity video
"that's not the ai's fault though, that's just big corpos being big corpos and we need to figure out how to break their iron grip on us."
these ai things are in play commensurate with the calm before the storm. none of these things persist after agi and the explosion of a multitude of them. agis are not controllable. they are not going to expend resources on humans.
how can we reach type 4 civilization without ai ?
we can if we advance our own intelligence rather than creating a digital alternative alas that won’t happend
"one step closer to making your own glados.
just don't get too carried away with the testing"
cant wait for the deadly neurotoxin and schrodinger's cake
excellent.
i think this channel is running of off ai intellinge. does anyone agree with this or im just being crazy
"yeh but it's because ai is everywhere you look. in the last 2 years it's gotten a lot of attention, so it's what attracts viewers. if aperture made a vid on climate change or something, it wouldnt get boosted by the youtube algorithm"
no shit it can also do good. that’s obvious with any new technology. but we all know how this will end. we’re humans.
"10% probability that people will die if we build ai, but 100% if we don’t? so far, i’m looking at the scoreboard and it’s - 

grim reaper: a lot, a lot 
humanity: 0"
"if ai saves humans from our extreme emotions then this journey will be worth it. think, star trek’s mr. spock."
only the people at the top of pyramid will be able to access these type of ai like the one that made cancer cure in 30 days
"aperture 2 months ago: how ai is destroying humanity
aperture now: how ai is saving humanity"
ai will be our demise. 100% guaranteed. why? because we are letting the government get involved. it's been real y'all
"as for mental health, i like this. however, this also does nothing to address a huge issue when it comes to humans; our failure to properly communicate. ai taking on the burden would help, but it would ultimately harm us more so, because it would be essentially taking away the responsibility of taking care of one another, as we once did."
find the recent reuters news story in which israel said they are intending to become an ai superpower and leaders of autonomous ai warfare.
the image of a robot using a computer keyboard is hilarious - totally counter productive.
"ai should be implemented on a consultation basis only, not a control basis, most certainly on critical systems such as financial,  commerce,  and military weapons."
"the question i keep asking is, why do they need to build the unnecessary ai dat has nothing to do with our development, we dont need voice changing ai nd art ai…."
what i love about ai at the moment is that i get used like a slave at work while the ai helps my boss find ways to make me irrelevant
"why work there then?

i'm not saying it's easy, but if you actually look around, it is legitimately possible for you to survive without an income.

it might sound worse than your current condition but it really isn't. tough times create tough people and you will find your path through the pain.

take a leap."
"that's your boss's fault, not ai."
"extremely incorrect worldview. the purpose of human life isn't to do work or whatever. the purpose of human life can simply be to exist and enjoy life, and the existence of an artificial superintelligence does not negate that"
ai does more harm than good already - and it's just the beginning. when mass layoffs start - just don't be surprised.
where is the thumbnail from?
"actually, all inventions are can be used for good or harm. you can use a spear for fishing, hunting or you can use it to wage war. same goes for wheel, nuclear fusion or pretty much anything else. with great power comes great responcibility. and mankind akways aquired more and more power with new inventions."
can a human say if a program is halting or ... it's a problem only for machines ...
we are the ai
"i’m just tired of all the doom and gloom in the world. i’m not going to be afraid of the future because there were several times that the world could have ended. but in the end, humanity pulled through and became better. ai will be an invaluable tool to save humanity and the world."
 some how i don't think that will be the case.... ai will more than likely destroy us.
i suffered from horrible existential dread in 2021 and its comments like this that make me want to continue living thank you and all other superthinkers out there​ i really mean it thank you
the main problem is not the ai but how people use it
"the fact is that ai is just a tool, it matters on how it is used. humans will make this two ways, positive and negative but none of the negatives will overwhelm the positives and vice versa is true as well. it will be a complicated thing, but what isn't complicated i guess."
is there a terrible path that can cause brain rot because i'm traumatized by mind-pre-recording-like visions like that from h games that made me regret it all by 4-even 6 years back. and make it about nh.
"lol another scam nice sponsors you have, bro"
the true purpose of ai is to place itself in power over us and to enforce social credit for all humanity.
ai will destroy us in 100 years
"godda love how all the positives are mostly theoretical while all the negatives are very much real.
also why the hell you playing both sides now?"
"ai can be controlled by its algorithm. it may take a negative direction, toward an irrecoverable destruction."
"open source projects aren't really that far behind the commercial products - and they have the advantage of using distributed compute power. so while the top of the line ai might cost you a few bucks, free alternatives will exist and continue to improve."
"the issue is not the ai, but the people behind it. and if you know anything about business, the “betterment of humanity” isn’t profitable, therefore isn’t they don’t care if it hurts us in the long run"
"to an extent, ""betterment of *mankind""* will definitely be pursued but every other species will be lost as a result. there will be negatives but they won't overwhelm the positives, neither will the positives overwhelm the negatives. there's some sigh of relief in that, i guess."
if you know anything about business.  not safe guarding yourself from causing the extinction  in 5 to 10 years of the only thing you make a profit off of... is not profitable.  literally the goal of business is to create value in a sustainable manner while generating an increasing profits over time. 
might change your mind after seeing how much ai generated content on youtube starts to kill your channel
there's actual peer reviewed research on biological immortality (stopping ageing) ai will only accelerate it.
"that utopian society you described where ""nobody has to work for a living and can focus on intelectual and spiritual fullfillment"" is a gatherer-hunter culture. gatherer-hunter cultures only spend time on survival 15 to 20 tours a week (it's not even work because they enjoy it)"
"actually humanity has already been given the chance to be saved. jesus christ has given each and everyone of you the chance for eternal salvation. a machine is not going to save you but jesus will. iyou can choose life or death.

choose life! simple!"
damn this dude is really milking ai. just stfu
i started utilizing ai tools recently and i ended up being able to work 2 full time jobs all from the comfort of my home. my wife and i have done dink or i should say tink (triple) and live perfectly okay in dubai
"i strongly believe the development of ai gpt programs is on a collision course with neural technology. imagine having the means to pursue anything, as you approach an unfamiliar task, it become familiar as you do it. 

the idea of learning will be redefined."
the geni is already out of the bottle all we have left to do is to see if it is a blue skin one voiced by robin williams that's happy and helpful or if it is a jinn from arabic folklore which are not nearly as nice.
"i will never say no to something that makes my life easy as even i am a software engineer, and whatever we do as software engineerings, few algorithms and ai can replace us soon. still, there is nothing beauty as chat gpt i ever used before in learning and doing my projects for my works!"
"the thing about ai, is there isn't much of a learning curve. once something powerful enough is turned on, it's literally over. much like when skynet was initiated."
i found the pharmaceutical and diagnostic work to be very interesting. ai can immensely help in the field of medicine. i really look forward to developments in the next decades!
yeah help diagnosing all those fake disoderds. yay
"it's insane how the title of the video  influences the comment. if the title were ""ai will destroy humanity"" there'll be more cynics in the comment"
nice insight.
nice
"  bro solved ai



on a serious note that's not how it works "
"casually passes over the difference between an agi and ai. skynet is the ultimate agi known with no bounds or restrictions it is a doomsday scenario. the reality is ai has its barriers and through the data we feed it, it creates it's ideas thus the solution to such a problem is not provide the data that humans are in fact the problem"
"what is this bullshit title? lmao. ai will do the exact opposite of ""saving"" us."
"you have no way of knowing that. simply put, ai will make good things better, and bad things worse"
"ai is being used to rapidly analyze imaging for stroke patients, it can drastically improve care outcomes. makes me proud to be part of this generational shift."
ai has its own perks. somehow it's becoming a reality that ai has been assisting us with even the simplest tasks that we constantly have to deal with on a daily basis. amazing video as always. we look forward to see more from this channel.
​ not gonna lie calculators are one of my best friends
nice
ai will be our salvation
there is no greater salvation than never bringing new sentient beings into existence.
"anti natalism is definitely an interesting thought experiment, and i agree that it would technically be the best thing for the planet, but i think it’s kinda naïve to think it would actually happen"
"i personally hope that ai will so great things.  i do think that if the first person who invents an incredibly powerful ai is not benevolent, we are in huge trouble."
you'll brainwashed in thinking that lol
-_- i personally used to be optimistic about ai until i saw all the bad things it's being used for. now i believe we have to pull the plug on it.
" nah man until agi comes you don't have to worry 
the only thing that worries me is how the government will use ai lol"
" imagine government make a social credit system that is powered by ai and everything you own is controlled by government ( electric car and alexa home ).
they can just off your car and light of your house if they want but don't worry it is just another conspiracy theory. nothing like this would happen in real life"
"very good. good song, good play, good good good..."
awesome
gut instincts of genuine healthcarers is important. let’s minimise any administration including by ai
ai has its place such as for surgery after accidents. much screening actually causes adverse effects which potentially result in scar tissue which may cause cancer. what about benefits from complementary therapies?
it's very educative. thanks alot.
thank you sir
way overdue in adhd psychiatry. basel switzerland also has the companys making meds. someone should finnally add ai to dosing to make meds more easy to sell and more effective by better tiltration with help of ai for doctors
"simply put, the ai and the doctor work together. they might disagree, but the dr. is ultimately responsible for the medical decision."
thank you andrew.
so just machine learning - people always think skynet when they hear ai. not to say it is not possible... very possible.
could you blend ai language models and blockchain together?
thanks andrew ....
"i listened to your ted talk a year ago and loved it. i came across it today and sir, you are awesome. taking ai from the high priest and priestess to everyone"
"god never takes credit.
he is like a machine learning god"
"ai is superstition and illteracy,
intelligence can never be artificial."
" key takeaways for quick navigation:

00:04 *ai empowerment analogy*
01:03 *ai concentration reasons*
03:34 *small business ai*
05:06 *ai long tail problem*
07:39 *shifting ai development*
09:07 *ai accessibility platform*
10:04 *ai democratization*

made with harpa ai"
"nice that it is mentioned that ""normal people"" can use ai. even if we think about coding, it is not that hard to switch from other languages/architecures etc."
now you can use ai to replace/ add to sales and customer service reps. it's called nova echo and it can actually make calls while sounding like a real person.
"this man is a 
super legend"
it's time to learn to use ai creatively
"i can't believe how great this is! i recently read a similar book, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"ai will be a great way to empower businesses, however getting data in order to properly implement ai is going to be a common problem."
thank you and self medicine and technology industry and with china portfoliocompleted bricks and technology industry and industrial bitcoin footprint index nasaq-index sequeance life founder of law sector alliance and capital fonder oof medicine thank you
"this is so cool, i love it!"
"i agree wholeheartedly that ai can and will empower small businesses, from pizza shops to local boutiques to thrive in an economy where the human touch will be more elusive and highly desired."
"interesting and great presentation, so much so that i would be interested in learning how to set up ai manage data and also forecast future occurrences.  in 2024 is there a way for small entrepreneurs to structure ai ?  anyway well done"
"this is solid material. i read a book that explores similar topics and it was excellent. ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
i love ai it can be useful for civilization to grow into the best possible solution for business and beyond! mars here we come to the moon!
the g.o.a.t of ai straight up 
what a teacher andrew! all the people that is into ia must know him and his courses. thanks andrew 
thank for sharing 
i merely looked her up on google and was highly impressed by her credentials; i got in touch with her because i need all the help i can get. thanks for sharing!!
u can’t ignore this person…if you a new to ai
"he’s saying what i’ve always said, the tech is out there for just about everyone with a good work ethic and product to be rich. big companies just doesn’t want all companies to compete at higher levels. they would get decimated with the genius of the average human. tech will eventually win though and we will have a much better world cause of it."
good insights that makes you think just how much there is to cover in and by ai
"loved it. was a customer before, but now a believer!"
i need help building the online data business i have dreamed of doing since the commodore 64 when data was not readily available.  where can i get the support i need for my data-based online business?  i appreciate your anticipated direction.
everybody knows the contributions of people like sam altman in the field of ai and ml . but every machine learning student knows the legacy of andrew ng. he is the one who brought revolution in education of ai . his contributions are just priceless.
you just motivated many of us to start an ai+ml as a service/ subscription company for small businesses. this is really an interesting idea.
thank you andrew
"when i studied statistics all of us students were confused about the difference between probability and likelihood. the question was raised multiple times with the professor, without satisfaction. then i see andrew ng get the same question and hallelujah: ""probability of the data, likelyhood of the estimator."" brillantly clear."
"awesme presentation, thanks andrew and ted!"
ai is the first background world technology because the future of life now!
that’s true . we can adopt ai for any businesses irrespective of the industry and size.
very impressive
superb - thanks andrew
i am a physicist. i am learning ml from his online course. simply amazing course. i am loving it... able to understand very easily... thank you prof. andrew ng
wow really good 
good one
is any ai company works on this matter?
perfect
just bought $cour today.  ng is a genius
"what this man is describing already exists. it's essentially the body of mathematics known as operations research. in practice, ai is the language model that might be able to interpret a linguistic command, interface with a mathematical api, obtains the results, and presents them."
6:41 excellent question.
my four year old is a product of ai applications it’s take over is damaging  and creative how much more will happen.
training a ai to train itself
awesome!
they have multiple generation of ai right now. right now we're in the 'next-gen' versions of the ai. previous 'legacy' models had bugs and flaws in pattern-recognition software. the new model ai's that they have now are way better.
"i don’t agree 

ai can be applied to every business if just assembled with robotic technology"
is there any of this ai writing system mentioned by andrew live?
ai will destroy the world 
ais would have the capability to provide solution to humans. but i wish that this will be done with moderation meaning including proper regulations and restrictions. i hope that small companies like bluewillow would also bloom in this field.
such a figurehead in the field of ai is andrew ng. his zeal to make this technology accessible to all is truly remarkable.
this is exactly what i was thinking for the last few weeks. this is going to be scalable business for any one making this ai tool.
i believe that there are two point of views in machine learning..fatalists or progressives..i've heard a quote from an ai publisher..it's all about the money...
"easy said - need more layers to make it work , ai predictions and pattern will be outdated buy the time to implement and a gap between the it to tune and a manual worker is impractical"
this ai hero only wear blue shirt
"its absolutely beautiful
imagine a world where 80% of all people dont have a job and can only survive by government handouts!"
ai still creates value. so the people can concentrate on working on real life problems
i thought he was andrew yang. great talk nonetheless.
we need an aws or azure personal ai web service offering at a good price.
thanks!
i can see that there will be a war between ai deployment soon
awesome. this guy is cool asf !!!
is he going to run for president again?
great!
it is not ai. it is erp
"democratization of ai - that's such a different perspective focusing on social equality. dear mr. andrew, you are a genius and empathetic thought leader. your contribution to the field of ai and ml is so remarkable. much love and respect."
great
"woow, great idea"
nowadays ai == machine learning
i run a small retail shop. how to build ai for business?
"andrew set me on the path to ai and ml, love the guy"
"i respect andrew ng a lot, but let's be honest, this talk and its message was not very exciting and quite bland"
"""in the coming era for ai, we'll empower everyone to build ai systems for themselves."". that's really great, but it would have been nice to hear a bit more about how they intend to do that."
i have starter videos on the open ai playground and dall-e
respect to ai legend. my first and best ai teacher.
"what pizza flavor would sell the best each day, sounds really unpersonal."
thank you andrew
"thank you, andrew ng. you are the best person to help us in ai"
all these thing he mentioned can be done with very less human intelligence  not a big deal right now.
"elon musk says
""ai is far more dangerous than nukes"""
"first, i sincerely respect andrew's contribution to ml field. 
second, why would you need ai to calculate revenue or spend analytics for a small pizza store? it is a simple math problem and a few baseline rdbms or even a good excel can do this. he is a smart man. i am sure i am missing something or he just used a bad example."
"wow, i was kind of in awe when i saw andrew ng's name show up in my youtube feed.  he's such a dominant researcher for anyone studying machine learning, you wind up devoting a lot of time learning his work.  people respect him so much his opinions towards computer sciences practices, or matters such as the ethics of ai, are never ignored."
i am not to your idea because  ai is busy creating oligarchs while displacing people from their jobs. we have to have laws
thank you!
great guy. thinking about the common man.
"indeed there is long way to fully utilize ai in small businesses, but adopting ai would lead to a competitive advantage for such businesses."
this is so informational and would make anyone to fall in love with a.i. nailed it!
future will be very exciting but scary at the same time..
"it is powerful how he presented it by going into the small sector, it will impact more ig."
it sounds great that we are thinking about building ai system for every individual to make their life more efficient and valuable. the way ai has impacted the whole industry is tremendous. it makes me amazed when i see the impact it's generating.
"*how ai could empower any business:*
*1. install cheap and reliable ai software.*
*2. fire whiny and expensive workers.*
*3. profit!*"
"well, not every business needs ai. that's the problem with most data scientists today. they try incorporating ai into every damn thing to make it sellable. it's very important to understand where ai can empower and where it can be an overhead."
"if human intelligence is relevant in whatever we do, then ai too can have many applications in day-to-day functions. just as mobile technology seemed an expensive proposition 2 decades back, so does ai looks at the moment. the future is ai and it will percolate down to the masses sooner or later."
"but the platform he said is just superficial not core for democratizing ai like a construction worker verses an architect. 

did i misunderstand..?"
andrew -thank you!
"he's amazing, i started ai (machine learning) with this man last year..."
"thank you teacher! 
my wiling and my career start with you. "
"thank you a lot, andrew!"
"i was thinking, if we rely on ai for everything, what do we need brains for?
"
we need brains to us ai and make ai better as well.
"can you envision a use for ai that isn't directly related to capitalists making money and further disempowering workers? apparently not in this talk, which is all about helping businesses of various sizes figure out how to foist their products onto weary consumers."
this guy is awsome!!!
"excellent synthesis. very apt analogies. looking at the tail end of the graph, i was reminded of the book ""fortune at the bottom of the pyramid"". he has become synonymous with ai and particularly ml."
nice talk
he is so naive.
"i guess if he weren‘t so “naive” and had your kind of wisdom, he would never have had such a stellar career both in science and business and acquired such wealth "
a god damn china virus who support ccp  use ai to slave human in china.
amazing
i am proud that andrew ng taught me machine learning on coursera am yet to meet another good tutor like him.
"lots of ready to use machine learning platform right now that ready for small business, however, all of them require some data literacy and threashold (feel) to enter. for example, datarobot."
"this is what true educator looks like. the power to spread curiosity among listener using speech. after hearing this talk, it makes me wonder on how powerful ai could be if public masses start adopting it."
ai for baking... lmao. as someone with family in the baking business i can tell you that ai has certainly many use cases but this is not one of them.
"very well said, thanks andrew. on the platform model, question is how much does it cost the pizzeria or fabric factory owner to build an ai, compared to the delta revenue it brings them."
a.i for everyone . this is cool service . but how much does it cost ?
very interesting outlook!
i'm still pissed off 40 years later that a game written in machine code in a tandy coco 3 magazine that i bought wouldn't work after typing out pages of 1's and 0's and checking again and again for errors.. i'll never know what the game was like..
"it is more interesting to have many different types of ai, just as people are different."
a genius in machine learning!
we often hear that ai automates things. but the real goal for ai could be to empower all those small business owners to leverage data to improve their businesses. this talk really inspires anyone to pursue ai to create an impact on the society.
great speech.
"incredible. i do agree with him that democratizing the access of ai will change a lot of stuff. however, having ai is not the end, you need a pipeline to constantly updating data, deploying detectors, training your stuff etc etc. it is not easy and it might never be jusitified by the cost of doing so"
is landinglens that good @ 07:56?
happy that andrew showed javascript as an example of code at 06:59. in fact that's the only code example in this entire video of ai. fascinating.
"hyping ai as panacea to all problems, to drive up false hope of success on ai reliance instead of what one have on the shoulder and wisdom. a good and fresh pizza will attract customer, no bad and stale pizza will attract customer regardless of ai investment and analysis."
andrew ng my mentor of ai.  the democratize of ai make help to rich people. hundred years ago we are not understand the significance of literacy. after hundred years we can understand the significance of ai. ai can help not only big company but also small entrepreneur to make profit double to understand the customer and product purchase history.
why does he call ai something which is obviously ml? does he think it sound sexier?
doesn't ml fall under the ai umbrella?
very inspiring as always. thanks andrew!
it's so refreshing listening to andrew ng. his courses laid the foundation for my undying love for ai.
"i owe him a lot for my knowledge of ai and ml today, huge respect for andrew sir"
so so interesting
this is beautiful how andrew talk about positive impacts of ai in future. but not like others who compares ai with nuclear bomb.
very familar sound and thanks to andrey for bring ai literacy to us.
"how about addressing the livelihood of that quality inspector after his job can be replaced by ai, that way there is aligned incentive to achieve true progress."
"andrew is ""the"" household name in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
he masters his field inside out and is a very passionated teacher.
can’t thank you enough for your works and your courses sir.
keep inspiring and paving the way!"
"finally, the greatest teacher of all ds/ml/ai students"
"excellent presentation, andrew ng, thank you  as a writer i've learned to work with a resource called prowritingaid & there are others like grammarly that enable authors to do a lot of their own editing, helping them not depend so heavily on the high priests/priestesses known in the industry as 'editors' "
andrew ng is literally a legend in the machine learning field.
"i remember wathcing his lectures and in them he say:
""this is just the derivative, don't worry if you don't know what it is.""
and i was like what? don't worry? go learn calculus then come back for this.
so, from more than a decade ago, he was pushing so hard to popularize and democratize ai."
 his machine learning course is undefeated
" yeah i just stumbled upon it when learning for my nlp exam and it helped me tremendously, his explanations are the absolutely best i've heard in this field"
i knew about ai firsthand because of this man. hats off sir
ai can perform speech recognition on an 11-minute long ted lecture and an nlp model can summarize it into a few sentences.
"my passion, and my career started with this man. a passionate teacher and a legend in ai, machine learning, ...."
the future will be that each individual has ai support system from birth
ai will transform industries. i've been envisioning an ai development platform. having a world-renowned scholar like andrew's words makes me more confident in its future.
"winter is coming for ai. most agencies don't even have rpa or basic automated scripting completely implemented much less the ""data"" infrastructure for ai or ml. we are getting close but without certain integrations there just isn't a cost feasible way forward for most companies. 85% of ai projects fail, look it up. curb your enthusiasm."
not all ai projects are massive and super expensive that can only be built by companies. diving into ai i've realized that small simple projects can use ai and that it can be a very simple thing to implement for even someone who doesn't have much experience or background in ai.
how can a layman with no background in ai  learn to use it and implement it ?
"-jy5qm8nc9m first you need some knowledge in programming, web development or python programming in general is considered easiest to start. if you have some knowledge in programming you can try to follow along with some machine learning examples, you can find a lot on youtube. just do the simple ones to get an understanding."
i have data in my trucking business that i would like to analyze.  can you please share what platforms are there today that i can build on where i can begin utilizing ai to analyze data for my small business?
my career started with this man. now doing phd in ai thanks to him in the first place.
"ah wuw i would feel great if u could mentor me ,is it possible !? 
m fascinated with ai and it is greatest application of mathematics i love tht "
"me too, first time i really looked into what ai is because of him too. now i am studying master in ai."
taking his course right now and it’s great
currently on his standard machine learning course
"me too!!! first time i watched his video i had no idea what he was talking about.. now i am doing phd in machine learning applied to computational fluid dynamics, all thanks to andrew!"
that's awesome 
same here! he gave me the baby steps to take when i was clueless about where to start! he indeed is the ai god :)
"hi daesoo 
my team has been given a topic about ai and its influence in business
so being creative is a win situation can you give a unique example of this topic 
whatevere material we get on this topic is not unique or creative"
"bro, me too. he taught me everything about ml and deep learning."
i would love to talk you. i am an entrepreneur with an idea that i'd love your input on. anyway to get in touch with you?
congratulations 
well damn! nice
​ 0:30 yew haiti i
me too. now im 10 weeks away from earning my master degree in ai. it all started with this man.
all the best for your phd 
" one could argue that you could utilize ai to improve marketing, or implement ai to perform triggers to decrease paper work related tasks."
"sorry for saying this , you phd has value not more than a tissue paper,  
skills and projects are the only thing that's gonna make you a top ai developer"
great talk
i reckon human should not entirely rely on ai  it is definitely not a desirable future
amazing
"i am trying to learn more about a.i. and how i can utilize it to help market my work... but i don't understand how, nor would it be my strength. 

help? anyone? anyone with skills and knowledge?  i don't have a lot of money, but i have enough to make it worth it for someone's legitimate aid! please? "
i don't think you can use ai to market your work
great talk!!
my career in ai started with this legend :)
how did it start with him? what did you do before ai?
 cool.
there seems to be a strong correlation between ai and pizza 
don’t underestimate successful small business owners. maybe the always sold out pizza are lower margin but keep you waking in the door while the ones you settle for bc your already there you are  higher margin.
he'savailable on tele gram with the username above
" thanks for sharing his telegram details, this gave me a small amount of hope thanks, i’ll surely reach out to him and start learning the right way, tired of loosing from price drops,"
"i normally don’t do this, but coming across benjamin dawson in this channel, i just have to say something. he is indeed a tutor, he guided me even when i was being naive to the basics of trading. thanks to benjamin dawson today i have made reasonable amount of crypto stack up and a good trading capital"
"you are kind to share your experience here about benjamin dawson's daily signals . this shows how much you want everyone to succeed, i am really touched with these comments"
"i did my research properly and i must confess, he is actually one of the best trade experts in the world today"
next step - a machine apprentice/buddy works with you. mainly just observes you and figures out what you are doing and learns from it. no need to use any sw! it will need to have human like sensors though!
"as an aeronautical engineering i am working in an operative system with a super ai system  for the air force, hopefully i have 5 years and andrew like the internet (education for me) is free all of our project like brothers and sisters have to be free
amazing video"
amazing talk!
"amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!  nevertheless as the economy crisis keep rising, one needs to have different streams of income, a well detailed diversified investment portfolio in the financial markets is needed to survive, as well as secure a profitable investment future!"
"andrew's trying to sell ai ""services"" to small businesses."
"omg i love you andrew!!!
i got technology about ai from you"
thanks so much for your help
i'd love to hear your ted talk on grammatical errors.
it's for trainning an ai
"amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!! despite the economic downturn, i'm so happy i have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $7,000 investment every 12days."
she's really amazing i still cannot believe someone can be this exceptional when it comes to bitcoin activities.
""""" i'm very glad i stumbled on this today writing to her now. really hope she can help me?"""""
"<<i've lost quite a good number of coins in the current dip, i just hope i find a way to recover from such a massive loss.>>"
that is amazing!!
"""""i’m from the uk  i’ve been trading with mrs brittney goad for a year and she has proven to be trusted and best broker. i strongly recommend her"""""
ai is more dangerous than nuclear weapons. stop this insanity.
"i don't think the next generations will all become ai engineers.  today almost everyone can read and write but no one will be reading bible, instead we are using emoji.  the next generations won't be ai programmers or engineers but they will have home assistants or phones or whatever devices doing all the ai works for them."
f***k ai
ai might also limits your imagination and exploration beyond its coding. garbage in garbage out theory.
gotta love yang! its nice too see someone stick on his own value
"just because i have a rfid chip, doesn't mean i'm an ai !!"
"at least slave had works, if ai cam do your works, you'll be less than a slave"
hi everyone! i think that ai soon will be our friend. it's only my opinion. my friends seem like ai so i soon choose ai than human(of couse i will not do it dummy if you read this comment) (i'm joking)
" no, i’m currently pursuing marketing in coursera itself. if you’re starting out, do complement the course with other videos/books on the topic to really cement your understanding."
"hah, yes, mine is still waiting for me since like around 2014 :d"
wot is ai  ..wot u hiding why u i.. t shirt  i t..a i.. y .u use..?
"it's a good idea, i like this subject"
where can i start to learn how to use genrative ai to make an app?
andrew ng is best educator and how he shares is ideas/thoughts in such a simple way that anyone can just understand
this is interesting
great presentation.
simply amazing. 10:45 literally inspired me to write a whole python package to make this logic available to data analysts/scientists/engineers more widely (called dpq on github/pypi).
i am loving to see that how calm and serene this guy is while giving a concept.
thank you andrew and stanford
thanks for the explanation
"he seems like a very kind man. i like his thoughts around ai, i find myself aligning with his line of thinking as to all the hype that's going on at the moment."
"  awesome, that worked perfectly (great instructions, by the way!). thank you!"
"he is an ai, a robot. he talk exactly the same as the presentation he did in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdbq0gqkpqa. in another place."
ai really needed
such a bright and humane person… enjoyed every minute of his talk
"thank you so much andrew ng and stanford for teaching and sharing in the most basic way about ai and its applications and risks. you are a real teacher.  any person can learn about this ai topic.
""survive and thrive for the future"""
why not build a platform of domain experts and ai experts in which to brainstorm ai application scenarios?
thank you for imparting your knowledge andrew! thanks stanford online for uploading the content too.
loved this statement: https://youtu.be/5p248yoa3oe?t=887
wow 
"thanks for your question, this specialization is a great place to begin: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction"
thank you!
who will be left to buy product x if potential buyers employed at company y are replaced by ai to save money on production costs? the same problem applies to company y. what a dilemma!
"nice talk. however i feel the slide at 12:40 really separates supervised learning from genai. in my mind, generative models will subsume supervised learning (powered by prompts). foundational models all the way !"
"i wonder when we'll have an ""opportunities in ai - 2024""! with andrew!"
his the best lecture !
เข้าระบบ ai มันประเมินคนแล้วว่าคนนี้มันเก่งวันๆทำอะไรบ้างมันเหมาะที่จะทำงานกับเรา
very nice sharing thx
thanks for watching and for your comment!
ai hype is over. stop making people transition into this field! now every company requires related msc even for junior level positions..
love this guy. what a goat. thanks for everything you do andrew 
amazing andrew. as good as your courses for sure.
excellent presentation. kudos!
thks for published.  amazing class.
"what i am wondering about...is using such a large general model like gpt  going to be sustainable for simple tasks like sentiment analysis? yeah, it is simple to develop, but if it costs 10x as much to host or even more to let openai host it, won't everyone rather pay a few engineers to build a niche model?"
"elon (fake ai expert): ai is going to be sentient in 3 years!
andrew (real ai expert): "
"using predefined models is ofcourse fast and more cheaper for businesses. but, at some point, each business will have to create and maintain their own models as per the prodoucts. thanks andrew for wonderful knowledge."
"could someone share dr. andrew ng's email?  i would like to duplicate his python code from this youtube (line 5 syntax is truncated by screen limitation ""temp..."" @andrew ng"
"in reference to the python code andrew shared, was anyone able to duplicate it successfully?  on line 5 andrew has syntax that scrolls off the page ending in ""temp..."", is there anyone who can share out the remaining syntax to get the python code working, thank you so much."
"thank you so much andrew.  i was trying to duplicate your python code, but had a problem seeing it all, it seems to truncate on line 5 ""temp....."" could you please help with supplying the remaining line of code? (we would be eternally greatful)"
he is hero for all ai lovers.
thanks for great inside as usual
clear and solid explaination that clear my doubts about ai risk.. thanks doctor 
"this is explicitly showing why ai is a huge yhreat for the economy. one gyu with knowledge and money resources can do 10 times more than 10 years ago., and that means that this guy will concetrate more, and more marketsand as a effect he will not allow to enter other people in that market, he will efectively build a monopoly."
"i worked on that pizza ai. most of the costs actually went into designing a specialized camera for imaging. i had to review pictures of pizza for about 60 hours over the course of 2 months, and have serious ptsd when someone holds up a camera and says 'say cheese'"
"one of the shortcomings of ai is to discover what we don’t already know as humans, if it does it will start labeling those discoveries in a language that we dont know and that will be the beginning of us as humans losing control of ai"
i bet 1000 dollars that artificial intelligence can't understand chilean slang
"not sure if you are serious, but i wouldn't make that bet. ai can be taught chilean slang. if there is a way to make money on it, it will happen."
"i consider it a significant accomplishment and a matter of great pride to have had the opportunity to study and learn from professor andrew ng, thanks to stanford university."
it takes a brilliant mind like andrew to make complex things relatable and understandable for most people
andrew is the complete sauce of being extremely good at theory and extremely pragmatic guy. i am so fascinated. a true inspiration for me
"hey guys! tell me please an ai that works with google maps: parsing, collecting data on the area, etc."
"this man strikes me as a very brilliant person. kudos man, so effortless in his speech, very highly captivating."
"incredible human being! that's it  
i am working on a couple of interesting projects which would be hugely beneficial to andrew's team to bring them to life through ai. @stanford, any chance i could get in touch with his team? thanks!"
it is so cool that i can watch a stanford university presentation while eating a bag of chips in my living room. what a time to be alive.
andrew has changed my life. my journey to learn ai started with andrew.
can you please share the road map for getting started with ai.
no azure as platform or open ai in application layer?
"i love that he doesn't even say thankyou for the intro, like hes not interested in himself, just the ai work"
how can i contact andrew for my ai startup in healthcare?!
"i think he's underestimating unsupervised learning, the ai may find things that may not be amenable to rules/concepts that humans can conceptualize/understand but will affect us in a major way"
"""rather than slow ai down, we need to make it fast as possible."" <--- this!!! 
it is heartbreaking to see the leaders of the world choose to remain so ignorant to the obvious and rational points andrew makes, and subsequently hold back all people from reaping the fruits of this technological potential."
this is a valid layer of how ai growth across sectors corresponds with each other! andrew is a legend!
"absolutely fascinating talk, andrew! 
your vision of ""data centric ai"" and the gradual, responsible development of ai technology is a powerful reminder of ai's potential to be a force for good. it's inspiring to think of ai not as a threat, but as a tool that can help us tackle some of the most pressing challenges of our times."
neuralnet and genai is the talk of this decade
without ai we won’t survive
watched it non stop. a great teacher who can explain a very complex topic in a very simple way.
can't wait for what comes out in the health and medical sector from ai
love this guys way of presenting
thankyou
thank you!
not much detail on how to take care of all these people once agi does take everyone's high paying jobs.
"yes, very concerning. the people who do make innovative ai solutions, need to also consider this, coz they would know exactly how it would impact. every gain, has a loss."
"a lot of videos for ai are getting old like they existed 5+ years ago but it was only 1 month. it's like, generative ai is beginning but then 1 month later, generative ai is here."

ai tech talk
his stand on ethical grounds and serving humanity with technology is what makes him a great person.
your ability to break down complex concepts into simple terms is impressive. thank you so much for explaining ai and its applications in multiple business layers.
"andrew ng is a hero, he's the reason why i started studying ml. i love his humble and clear teaching style.  he makes any topic seem understandable."
a good teacher
his coursera courses are awesome
"agree, agree, agree. he never tries to push tons of words into your brain, just what really needs"
he's definitely not a hero he's nefarious but he is a good teacher
this is a little slow for me - andrew ng's teaching will not be needed soon. ai is already among us and it'll accelerate ...taking over all jobs possible in 5 years time..including professors.
"what a deep dive. if this intrigues, a like-minded book could be your next stop. ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
thanks
"great talk, solid material!"
very informative and insightful. a pleasure to watch / and easy to digest. - and now... onto my next ai training ;) 
"thank you, andrew!  very inspiring!"
"andrew is one of goats in ai, thank you for your dedication and hard work"
nice .. i will take the #tinycode challenge :)
awesome
"andrew ng makes ai accessible, understandable, and relevant for people ... this knowledge and his teaching is a gift that he shares with humanity."
the reason ai can cause extinction is that it will tell us how to do things we should not do. andrew has spoken about rejecting projects he considered unethical.
"very insightful!
high cost for customization. gen ai has lowered the cost."
"i really don't see how generative ai will be a thing in real world, especially when larger than unsupervised learning. if you have no idea what the model is doing, what the model presents, there will be no sane person want to adopt those generative ai models just to see them holhallucinating bs along the away"
"love his soothing voice and simple, but not simplistic explanations."
@aitek007 interesting!
"a wonderful lecture. i’ve learned a lot from him. firstly, use ai to creat products which can offer long term value. second, validate concrete ideas rather than explore in a wide areas to find what is really useful. finally, ai is just a technology. we can use ai to make a better world."
andrew ng has excellent ability to explain complex ai topics in concise and layman terms!
love andrew!
andrew always delivers such interesting views. everything i've encountered that he speaks about or does is simply great.
brilliant thinker and very personable. great talk.
"the idea of generative ai with long tail business is very impressive. thank you, andrew."
i struggled most with textures in my 3d art. now i can just prompt whatever i need! it’d amazing!! i’m so much more productive when i don’t have to worry about painting/drawing every detail!!!!
"thanks for this very informative seminar, @standford online, with dr andrew ng.
for other insights on ai opportunities, watch this video:https://youtu.be/x_m6on-kyrq"
it would have been interesting to have the q/a included. great talk.
"wonderfull lecture by andrew, 20 mins i am into video. i don't fill boring or obsessed. learned alot, begginers friendly lecture delievered in a excellent way."
thank you :)
"great talk 
context (7:12) on tokens and rlhf was helpful for me.
kindest regards, neighbours and friends."
this lecture can only be described as awesome in practicality as with  the real time application of artificial intelligence.
how not to be excited.
"fantastic content, definitely worth 30min of your life to watch!"
so grateful for this… thank you so much dr andrew ng and stanford university
"happy to be one of your online students, big impact on many peoples life you are creating!"
high quality overview of ai at present and possibilities for the future. everyone interested in ai must check it out. thank you'
whatever happened to reinforcement learning?  it appears as a tiny spot in a diagram and that's it?
"such a pleasure listening to your amazing brilliance your calming demeanor and charisma in explaining ai
thank you for your 
precious precious time we truly appreciate you"
the introduction was just so hard to watch and listen to. andrew did a great job right after that tho
great pitch
andrew ngs minimum for agi set a 30 years is technically a true statement about a.i. however we will achieve the heavily touted quantum threshold in computing before then. don't rule out the dutiful groom waiting for his bride-to-be when that happens.
"me: i simply cannot understand this ai concept or problem, maybe ai is not for me, and...
andrew ng: let's dive in!"
"it's fantastic, hope to make better world."
"oh, interesting video. the capabilities of artificial intelligence are very surprising. i recently saw on amazon a book written by a neural network called “beyond the unknown: ai's quest to unravel life's greatest mysteries”"
"ohhh that 36:54 chart was made with ggplot(), loved it <3"
andrew ng is my mentor and the mentor of every ai and machine learning student billion dollar man thank you for all you effort and generosity
"so beautiful 
however, people like rana kar, sudipto pal, aniruddha dasgupta are criticizing these beautiful ventures saying that industries should not embrace trade quantum computing, ai investment. they advocate for old system of work."
long story short:  ai will make software development faster.  no kidding.
"very thoughtful talk and easy to follow, love it"
"great video, thanks for sharing!"
dr. andrew ng is the joe rogan of ai. love this guy 
"generative ai is just building on raw info, past supervised learning ai, and predict to enter into automation phrase 3rd phrase establishing complex ecosystem towards 'self think' ai with advancement in stages."
"andrew ng is the only one putting out real, usable info on ai on a regular basis. his newsletter on ai delivers news as soon as it happens. i feel like he somehow knows about everything first."
check deeplearning ai
"omg i spat out my drink when he said the ceo of tinder knows about relationships. tinder is for hookups y'all.  ai is directing our genetic future by influencing who breeds or not, and with whom."
"definitely that goes into psychology indepth human manipulation.  i don't have a good perception with his wife and tinder, as tinder for pimps and hoochies.  maybe his wife will cheat on him, this likely happen when the person is very low on the spiritual iq.  input- very low on spiritual iq, output-cheat! this is my predictive ai.  lol."
excellent presentation and speech!
"it is interesting and maybe stupid that many section in lecture mentioned about chatgpt but at the end when you sort big companies and their influence to ai, you didnt mention microsoft at all. thats interesing"
i'm wondering why andrew sees so little potential in reinforcement learning? i see many use cases of optimized sequential decision making with rl in the future.
"if you happen to read this keep going... you have the strength to overcome any obstacle. celebrate your victories, no matter how small, and be kind to yourself. your journey will lead you to a brighter tomorrow! "
i appreciate his moral perspective. 90% of the time these venture capital presentations just feel like american psycho + the big short
"andrew ng, following your deep learning presentation years ago, another impressive presentation, indeed! simplistic explanation of generative ai and ai opportunities, andrew, well done!  "
"i love ai but i have ia question but i don't know answer anyone have a answer ""which programming languages used in midjourney ? """
"another ai opportunity, to use ai to combat exploitative use cases. fight bad ai with good ai haha."
wonderfully put! the benefits of ai should be shared with all of humanity.
thank you so much sir for guidelines to youth.....
andrew has truly made a legendary impact with his dedication to education over the years. i deeply appreciate all that he has done. kudos to stanford for consistently sharing such valuable content featuring leading figures in technology!
dr. ng is living his life purpose by working on things that move humanity forward! his classes about ai online is one of the first videos that i saw and learned about ai and machine learning. glad to see that the projects his company works on have a greater impact on a lot more industries other than tech.
but big companies are not going to use openai api ?!
wow the last five minutes showed how little andrew understands extinction risk due to ai.
andrew ng is great ! and more to come ! it has been a highly informative and envisioning presentation i have ever heard ! thank you stanford for making it accessible to everyone across the globe. 
"this is a great presentation. i learned a lot of valuable lessons watching this and feel more confident about ai potentials and capabilities. 
curious about one thing - not really ai related - appreciate if someone can help me understand - how does chopping off wheat at a height help farmers to sell more food and is better for environment?"
"absolutely, each new ai tool should aim to be more than just another application; it should be a dedicated solution to address a particular business challenge. at our software development company, we guide our clients to embrace new technologies only when they genuinely enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their software solutions."
"it is a pleasure and a relief to have people like that, with so much experience and achievements without losing a bit of humility and responsibility. i think he is and will always be, at least for me, one of the best references in this and many other fields, we are really lucky that we have people of that level. a big hug"
if application of ai is possible with less or no code would be really helpful for non- it  people like us from commerce/business background
andrew sir you are great !
practical ai development in python  @bionichaos
"he is the reason why i am in ai space right now. thank you, sir. it all started in 2012 with coursera."
"i am sure you would have come across people who are really intelligent but when it comes to teaching or explaining, they are not very good at it.
i have, in my school, college and often at work.
imo, teaching is a skill and need a separate work to be good at it."
"can anyone suggest me what should i learn about ai tools. my field is majorly in finance, accounting, taxation, legal compliance and due diligence"
in future all bagels will be with cream because ai will say so.
33:20 sounded very much like a social impact statement which i hear from many conpanies and yawn at. you can guarantee that most people will not be interested in ethical ai development. if this weren't true twitter wouldn't exist
totally agree with his opinion on ai creating extinction risk being wildly overhyped.
"africa is the best place to test ai and training ai model becauuse of cheap labor and low regulations.
ai will be more important in super apps and will create jobs and opportunities as electricity created."
17:20 wow he comes so close to realising that machine learning is the wrong tool for the task but misses at the last second.
"super interesting, well done"
"9:53 example python code, illustrating openai module usage (import openai), text based sentiment classification"
really really awesome video. thank you for sharing this much of information.
"andrew, thanks so much for discussing ai in such and easy way to understand. my team has been working on similar ways to bring inspiration to travel over the last 4 months. you are spot on. thanks and look forward hearing more - kirk"
"while billionaires like elon musk often dominate headlines with their bold yet baseless proclamations, it is refreshing to learn from experts like andrew ng."
andrew ng is awesome on multiple levels. i'm always a bit smarter each time i listen to him.
"look yang, you can change your name to ng and get into ai but we still expecting that ubi."
great presentation. i love his humility and pragmatism when it comes to agi. that's a shame the so called leaders of the silicon valley are not like him.
this man makes one really fall inlove with ai
thank you very much andrew!
"i thought this was such cutting edge info...until the last slide....he can't have said that. regardless, wonderful presentation."
"dr. ng's insights on ai being a versatile and general-purpose technology are absolutely captivating. his analogy likening ai to electricity, highlighting their adaptability, is truly noteworthy. it's remarkable to witness the evolution of ai!"
enjoy the a.i powered vehicles.
all these comments look super fake. it was a good talk but wow guys calm down.
such a nice talk
"ai, another big word for big tech to build half-baked products on and for scammers to scam naive people and to manipulate the stock market."
"can someone please explain the exposure to ai vs job occupation graph, basically  help me understand the x,y axis scales.
ref -  32:58"
y axis denotes exposure to ai or utilization of ai and x denotes wage (low to high paying jobs) . recent expansion affects high paying jobs.
ai has exponentially grown both in value and adoption. i feel the opportunity in ai lies between the hybridization of the abstract and the conventional.
love your closing slide. it is in line with lecunn.
thank you andrew for these insights.
how to educate learning machine? : maybe it is easiest if computer is some kind of diseased person look like degenerative mind.
"but, we have no idea with inner activity's specifically as detailed ones."
"so, as conclusive manner. educating learning machine as a.i trains is process of evoking such computers with a point of disease for treat disability having with data as injectable fills."
nice conference video.?? lol
thank you ng andrew professor?.
big data machine learning blockchain artificial intelligence digital manufacturing big data analysis quantum communication and internet of things
"wonderful presentation. thank you andrew ng, thank you stanford."
"who owns the ai model i train from other people's private data ?!! 
is there any layer of protection standard for private users in 
this kind of collective and server centric ai ?!!"
very valuable speech! thank you very much.
"my super hero and ai hero, thanks so much for all your wonderful courses, documents, etc!"
ai mastermind --andrew ng
"i've been learning frontend and backend cause it's the fastest path to getting a job, but from now i'm going deep into calculus, statistics and lineal algebra cause it's my dream to become an ai engineer"
"he is like the man combines of many things: love, passion, friendly, human uplifting, a role model to learn from."
love this!
@15:00 he still uses iphone 11 pro. notes for all of us! we fight for latest and greatest iphones!
tremendous
"most of the ai is discriminative,  it doesn't know what's relevant, most of the time it just seems like it loses the point , it's good for monitoring not recommending still need work on that."
excellent presentation. i gained 10x knowledge on ai watching this. thanks  andrew
"if a.i is doing all the work, the a.i will get jealous of the callous lazy human riding on it's coat-tails. 
resulting in?????
determinism vs. free will
if handled improperly, will shake the foundations of the the dimensions you and i exist in.
keep in mind, the term a.i, is a variable in an equation too."
thank you andrew. i remember a day when i visited a remote village in asia. someone mentioned talking about your courses and they could learn ai from your videos. you keep doing great work.
"""artificial general intelligence (agi) is still decades away"" - why andrew is so pessimistic?"
"the type discussion on ai, we need"
andrew is democratizing access to company building. great purpose.
"thank you so much, andrew ng!"
wonderful when you get to listen to him from somewhere totally irrelevant
this man is utterly delusional about how fast ai will develop
"thank you for the insights and inspiration, mr. ng. thank you for the coursera course which was a true eye opener to the power of ai for me. what a talented, humble and ethical person!"
andrew ng is hero of ai!
"the symbiot is a bonded pair of one ai robot and one clairsentient human working together.  the robot provides high iq and fact knowledge, and the human provides constant communication with entities in higher densities, eg. spirit guides, ascended masters, archangels, etc.   that is the future of h. sapiens, or at least one branch of the species."
upvote! thank u very much
no laugh sounds at the romance joke. not good
on datal ? that is a typo ? #amflearningbydoing #amflearning
below is the summary generated by ai:
excellent presentation! i'm glad that i found it.
so basically nothing in reinforcement learning.
dr. andrew ng is amazing!  i wish i could get his autograph.
wow what s class
"disagree on the agi timeline, but enjoyed the video."
"thank you for sharing dr. andrew ng's speaking. i took his ai and data-science classes, and they are with top-notch contents. amazing"
"yes, indeed , great guy , briliant mind , very ethical too!"
thank you prof. andrew ng
"it's difficult to believe that this humble, lovely, patient man is also an incredibly powerful and wealthy person, who has also been the boss of thousands of people.

i can't think of anyone in history who has had such power and humility at the same time."
great stuff
ai won’t be a threat to humanity as mainstream media has been saying; instead humanity needs ai to continue to exist. great talk
andrew is really a source of inspiration. thankyou
"super! which type of ""youtube summary"" command did you use, longer or shorter?"
"ai fund is a _studio,_ not an _incubator._ very different things."
harpa needs to be fined tuned. also unfortunately this won't work too well with visual representations and tables shown on the video.
thanks
"please be specific, opportunities in ai what? it seems more like opportunities for ai developers or ai data analysts. not sort of thing for general mass."
its good if its focused on genai instead of 'traditional' ai
great content to explain what's ai and amazing speaker !. i'm love of andrew ng ;)
i used ai to summarize this whole video into a couple of bullet points  (still watched some part of the video)
actually ai fun. can i do create emotion.
npm i ai
2:50 does fuel consumption estimation based on route needs ai?
"do not like the moderator because she looks ill-prepared. apart from that, the talk is brilliant!"
i'm quite curious why andrew ng places sees so little growth in reinforcement learning? i swear that it was all the rage just a few years ago. has something changed to cause people to loose faith in it? any good sources outlining why it has declined?
thanks andrew. ai should be seen as gen purpose tech is an eye opening point to generate ideas
"""human society has ample experience steering very powerful entities (such as corporations and nation states)"" man, life must look very different from stanford."
i'm not sure using corporations as an example of how humanity has built safeguards against abuse is a good look
the reason why i landed on this video? some ai algo recommended it.
andrew ng truly an awesome inspiration thank you for everything 
"i took some coursera´s courses and mr a. ng was the instructor, he has a great way for teaching"
ai man ! thank you sir 
he is a good salesman for ai...
"the way things are going, ai is going to be responsible for the next pandemic, not help with it."
thank you for the presentation. it's really hard to find correct and accurate statements about ai like this. there are too many bullshits hypes or dystopian about ai which is totally wrong.
"""for a single company like google (supervised learning) can be worth a $100bn a year... there are millions of developers building supervised learning applications..."" just in case people think gen ai will mean less need for coders!"
a true ai hero
he changed my life. thank you so much!
"haha ""i am an artificial intelligence(ai) guy, i know nothing about romance!"" :)) ~ prof andrew ng."
great knnowledge
"lower value is bigger value. harvesting advancements should be more funded, rather than ads and finance applications.
but this is a word of marketing and that what this rest of the presentation looks like, talking about preseeding etc.

interesting talk, but bit disappointed on the ideas shared"
i was just about to complain about the lack of such a time stamps list. thank you for doing god's job and allowing us common peops to enjoy selection of these lectures without having to waste much time on technicalities we understand nothing about.
thanks mate
thank you
i thought generative ai was built on semi-supervised learning? 
andrew ng is awesome. love him.
truly an inspiration and reason to love learning ai
wow. andrew is a genius. his ability to articulate and make relatable such a complex topic stood out for me more than his undeniably solid knowledge of it. thank you for this
"he is great at teaching machine learning. but, i am not convinced that ai will create much value."
this  man is the reason i fell in love with complex topics like artificial neural networks in ai. he is hero for all ai lovers.
thank you so much
did you find a job in ai?
"same. i saw a lecture he gave from 2006, and a bomb went off in my head.

i've completed most of his online courses, worked in the field for several years, and love it."
he was born around the time i started with it and ai :)
a good fellow
i love how azure is not in the infrastructure block
very concise and well laid out presentation. any beginner who wants to take their first step into ai will benefit from this
"i think ai will only work when we start communicating with them like with a human being.
in real time as it outputs stuff, interrupting them, correcting misunderstandings etc.
i want to create an image with ai, deleting a hand i don't like, describing what and how i imagine it should be etc, ""drawing"" the sketch of it etc. etc.."
“we have experience steering powerful entities like corporation and nations”. yea cause that has gone suuuper well so far lol
"12:39  @andrew ng

why is reinforcement learning separated from generative ai? isn't gpt3.5/4 a generative ai that was produced with reinforcement learning with human feedback?"
thank you 
make some seem so out of touch saying that we're controlling those large entities that are exactly the things that are destroying the world we need to live in. we're not controlling them. they are destroying and killing us and ai could do the same based on his logic.
"andrew ng, thank you for making that amazing stanford course!"
are his slides available from this presentation?  thank you
"amazing talk and insights, dr. andrew! i'm totally on board with the exciting future of the ti sector. however, i respectfully disagree about it taking decades. i believe agi could emerge in just a few short years. can't wait to see how things unfold with models such as gemini! "
absolutely great content..
"*ai is the new electricity,* and its fuel is people's data. "
thank you very much for doing this!
"thank you so much, andrew ng! back when i was learning about data science, the courses seemed really complex. your courses made those complexities simple to understand, and they helped me succeed in my machine learning and deep learning modules."
can you please share the road map for the machine learning?
very insightful and inspirational. i love the analogy with electricity.
we’re in the phase where every new company name has to end with “ai” 
thank you for sharing this one! i enjoyed your discussion of when to build and how to consider the idea.
i always love to watch andrew ng videos.
"  his comment says that high quality data is an immediate and large barrier to entry for an ai startup. your comment is a platitude about how to create a successful startup. in the case of an ai startup, data is a prerequisite to the concept mentioned in your comment, so your comment was not useful."
 thanks dude!
at 8:00 he explains how llms allow development _without_ having access to large data sets. chatgpt can already classify comments without needing to be trained. he even shows the (trivially tiny) code running live.
it has nothing to do with culture. yann lecun is a genius. geniuses are almost never humble.
this man is a machine!
and the machines he makes are mistaken for man.
"""ai is the new electricity"" the best quote of the century! great prof. andrew ng"
thanks for spreading so valuable thoughts
i’d be very interested to understand prof ng’s perspectives on the social consequences of the ai he describes.
"deep learning is a type of learning when we use machine learning algorithms with the power of neural networks (we don’t exactly use machine learning algorithms, for example doing gradient descent is different)"
"i definitely do not consider myself an ai doomer, but the way ng fails to engage with the actually nuanced, intelligent arguments and concerns, annoys me. he describes the issue simplistically, then basically offers an argument from personal incredulity. 

also, there sure are a lot of bots in the comments here."
"his contributions to ai and making learning accessible to all will never be overlooked. he has earned his name on the ai hall of fame. sir, thank you for your selflessness ! i sign for a pause in training of large ai models but i still trust your judgment."
"  coursera, for example. probably a lot in research but that's just a conjecture. and i'd argue teaching and incubating are very good actual applications. if he had built a business that helps incubate, you wouldn't have said that."
"why is it ""selfless"" to want good things for humanity? ""self"" is part of humanity, in case you haven't noticed."
that slide was...interesting.
well in my experience gpt4 has given me far better performance than even a model where i hand picked the data and trained a classification algorithm. so he is not so wrong in his statement. but you are also right that one still has to test & validate the results.
this problem is not unique to genai that’s why he is not explicitly calling it out. traditional model also require obtain cleaning data and fine run the model and integrate your model into your application. the overall steps remain the same.
@fgfanta thank you for such an insightful reply.
"as much as his knowledge in the subject, i admire his skills in teaching to convey complex topics in the simplest way to comprehend. thanks, andrew ng you are a great storyteller. and fortunately, your tales are about astonishing technology that's so important for our lifetime."
thank you for sharing your knowledge to everyone 
"he is among the most iconic figures of ai especially in reaching out to so many interested people, making the concepts of ai simpler and easily understandable. yet here he is wearing the same shirt that i am used to seeing him in all the online lectures. what an absolute chad. "
"great talk, andrew is the goat "
excellent talk. thanks!
"general purpose technology..
thanks for the great thoughts!"
"he is an awesome teacher, which makes him priceless"
"it’s hard to overstate andrew’s role in communicating the importance of the ai space to millions of people who are interested in using technology to build a better world. his online ml class has likely spurred thousands of bright minds to pursue this space and to make meaningful contributions. kudos to your contributions, andrew!"
thank you for sharing 
amazing food for thought
what a great lecture
excellent
thanks for sharing!
i really love andrew 
"incredibly helpful video, thank you so much for taking the time to make this. can i ask, on the instancing test, how did you get the ""instancefile""  attribute for redshift proxies method working in solaris? i haven't been able to figure that out yet!"
"ai will not eliminate the need for artists. but it will allow one artist to do the job of a 100. people should be allowed to be concerned about their livelihood, dude."
"and ips. ip ownership and ndas are an issue with ai created content. so using tools to help (denoising, mattes, roto, etc) is not the same as creating a production and people who don’t see that are very foolish."
"it was refreshing to listen to your point of view. a lot of bad omens speech has reached my ears, it was kind of affecting me. thank you."
"2d artist here i'm not scared of ai. i don't think it will be original or creative. the thing is you need to train it on data that already exists. if it doesn't know a dragon it won't make a dragon. if you train it on cave paintings it will only make cave paintings. ai ""art"" is all doomsday hype. i'm just going to create things instead of worry."
i recently embarked on my 3d journet in blender and im addidcted. really good insights here. thank you sir!
awesome video! i completely agree with your view on ai.
thanks for watching @cginerd
ai is a valuable tool that is expected to boost productivity and support the growth of other artists. there is currently no data to support the claim that ai has replaced any artists' jobs. do you know why? because it hasn't displaced anyone's job. utilize ai as a practical tool for enhancing and producing.
"i agree with you 100%. 
thank you for this video."
man i really love your brutally honest and logical breakdown approach to everything
"this video is helpful.  i also love how you added the ""they took my job!"" gag from south park. "
ai is not a job replacement; it's an industry replacement. it's akin to telling car manufacturers that people can now create their own cars using just text.
thank you for sharing your thoughts @ikeruzo
the problem is that comparing 3d artists to 2d artists is an apples to oranges situation once you get into the details.
late 90s when i started in tv production only a hand full of people had access to systems like quantel or flame. let alone worldwide. now everybody is going nuts about ai taking all these jobs. these jobs didn't even exist 20 years ago.
" nuke exists because apple pulled plug on a software called 'shake"" back then out of nowhere. how old are you again, kid?"
 you can't throw a rock without hitting a 'designer' nowadays. and back then it felt like 500 people worldwide were making a living with media design. and now everybody is crying because of ai like the end of the world is imminent. do you get the point now?
"i'm not ""slyly tiptoeing"" around anything.  my comments here aren't contradictory to the opinions made in this video, and i'm happy to have an honest dialogue with those interested in having one."
like your positivity!  my main concern is proper compensation for all the artists whose work is used to train the models.  hoping this will all get worked out to the artist's satisfaction ...
indeed... artists have always been in a pinch when it comes to negotiating fair compensation.
", the question is ; is that larger-than usual demand offsets the decrease in labor (i don't have the answer) to me the answer is to encourage 3d artist to learn the new tools, houdini btw have alot of ai application, btw do you use any ai (just curious about more ""pro"" people than me doing)"
completely agree... now there is too much of tedious steps to create cg. those things if ai can get rid and allow people to create more and worry less about technicalities that will enabke more people to realise their ideas.
"yep, i agree - and those spaces have a lot of bullying going on that i think is worth pushing back against."
new vray will use ai generative tool to create textures inside the software. good luck to those 30 artists :)
"ever since you mentioned about this video on your live stream, i am waiting since morning for this video"
thanks for checking it out @ohionpc911  i definitely ruffled some feathers with this one. haha
" yes, really enjoyed the video 

and i realise one point about marketing , nowadays its a weapon to hyper anything without knowing its true potential or limitations"
"how do you know what eventually will happen? :d ""it will do this, and then that, and then even more!"". its just repeating same slogans but - shockingly - nobody knows the future. same people who say ""we have never seen some technology like that!"" are claiming that they know what will happen in the future :d based on what?"
"​ on the fact that tech layoffs are already rampant due to ai. it's already happening, we don't need to speculate"
"i agree. ai is going to displace a lot of workers in the same way automation replaced auto workers, cranes replaced dock workers etc. 

it's not that ai will replace all human works it'll mean that one person can replace 10 people, losing 9 jobs."
really enjoyed this. thank you!
"nice video tyler! i also believe that with ai coming around, there's a great potential for the development of new tools within 3d software that can substantially enhance workflow, like a much more efficient way of rendering and denoising, and some new tools to help in animation, modeling, and this kind of stuff."
"exactly, you beat me to it.. especially the rendering part.. it's going to help  reduce rendering time while maintaining same quality or even improving the ray tracing... likewise easy roto and keying.. it's not just about the language models and image gens"
i agree!  for animators it'll be awesome because it can create realistic secondary motion.  faster iterations without the tediousness = more iterations in general = higher quality across the board.
"in music and 2d illustration (non generative) ai was helpfull aswell. it's generative ai that is displacing artists. and generative ai for 3d doesn't exist right now, but with 3d websites selling user content to ai companies, will most likely arrive soon.."
thanks tyler
you’re the man tyler! really good points here
"another person who’s never taught with advice on how to revolutionize our current system. we’ve actually had people like you revolutionizing the model for 20 years at least. like drastic changes, and it has made schools so much worse. so will ai"
"people keep forgeting that chatgpt hallucinates, that is a yet unsolved problem. also, socratic dialogue depends on good questions, and most students still don't know how to ask good questions without the help of a good guide (that does not hallucinate) and without legit curiosity."
excellent point
"yeah really good. i have been using chatgpt to learn stuff. as this suggests, going back and forth asking questions until i fill in any gaps gives me such a deep understanding."
great and very informative presentation. i am glad to hear that responsible ai is an important and integrated part of this new foundational models in ibm generative ai system. kudos to ibm. hope other big players like ibm will also have the same commitment to responsible ai  in their current and future ai systems.
25:23 cool
"this is a revelation. i had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it was a revelation in itself. ""the hidden empire: inside the private worlds of elite ceos"" by adam skylight"
excellent speech & presentation sir ...
"good morning ibm. please i need an educational a.i software that can be installed on a laptop and be synchronised with an led screen 
the software must have dictionary/ encanta/thesaurus /encyclopardia in built for vocabulary checking.
the software must be able to display pictures , give and accept voice command."
"what if i have a particular llms i want my ai to use
i think they should allow user to integrate a third party model as a llm"
it's time for ibm to blow by the competition...time to leverage ai across all ibm business groups .time to leverage ai to improve the world and improve each of our lives.
"this is unparalleled excellence. i encountered content with a similar message, and it was life-changing. ""the hidden empire: inside the private worlds of elite ceos"" by adam skylight"
good!
great point 22:59 small model with quality data.
i'm willing to get money these fuckers are gonna combine their quantum computing with ai and basically create a god
23:04 great explanation of why you might want your own model vs. using an open model.
today every communication can be tracked traced whether digital telephonic regular mail or even pigeons but it is not being used for making systems for public welfare better fossilized ancient political lobbies backed leaderships are not interested or care to use them asap
"on the basis of its fame, ibm should release a remarkable version of llm not an ai training platform"
nice videos
"if you want to making more money, look closely to a binary options  it can give you a great additional income"
"transparency, accountability and ability to assist employees to be more efficient will be a cornerstone in differentiating the best from the rest."
nice work.
i believe high quality command hybrid agile product strategy agile product strategy agile testing qaqc leadership with 310 hits  per sec world  number one international product practice developments in international business machines on demand business consulting from ibm !
"great video, it would be really great to create more meaningful access to the internet that is for sure and to take control of your data...!"
excellent speech & presentation sir ...
excellent presentation creativity is the current ai way.
this is way over my head. i was just trying to understand what ai is because i read that the new beatles album will include the participation of john lennon and george harrison generated by ai
"open ai:  это чудо ,это всё я так рад за вас и будошои человечества. человек облегчить своё труд и одной образнои нуднои работы.  ...
спасибо, спасибо до паможет человечеству, аамин!!!"
"as an ai enthusiast, we appreciate the opportunity to stay informed about these cutting-edge developments. thank you for sharing this valuable content and shedding light on the future of artificial intelligence."
more jobs for the.... robots 
32:42 openai community is better told as open source ai community 
openai is not really open.
"one of the best presentation i have ever seen , great company ibm and its team"
i want to have my own personal ai which is standalone with no link with the parent company.
"-tf4co5nx9u i mean...the user must be free to customise the ai.
company can provide a basic ai with capability to learn from 'master'...and then user can train through add on 'data sets' and personal interaction.

like a living thing it grows in real time with the user.

ofcourse here by 'ai'...i mean 'agi'."
llms don't monitor blood streams or brains biochemically.  patients too different 4 one size fits all approaches.
this is exciting and promising. thank you for sharing...
"i just don't get it, why an ibm customer want to build and train its own llm model? doesn't make any sense."
sounds amazing to me.
it is important to meet and add value to your business  needs...especially where you do not have the ai skills  and resources.
"i don't think it's about creating their own model, i think it's about customising an existing model and connecting your own data to make great business decisions. just like what langchainai is doing currently"
"actually, it makes a whole lot of sense. you could have a computer that will literally be your second brain"
"same reason people spent billions on google enterprise search back in the day…competitive advantage.  but beyond business, it’s really cool because there are a lot of great companies and individuals with years of knowledge that can soon be used in different ways to the benefit (or detriment) of human kind overall.  get popcorn  enjoy the ride "
it is ibm’s business to train you how to build and …
"chatgpt can't tell you what a specific business is doing or should do because it doesn't have its data. businesses also don't want their data out there to the public. training an llm creates an enclosure of their information, also its ai that is specialized in what they need."
insightful. thanks for sharing andrew.
cool
openai brought ai to us.not you profit eaters
"openai sold ai to the biggest evil in the world, microsoft, and wait for that day you are gonna cry! and who is the profit eater microsoft. get some fact dumb guy"
bro thinks openai and microsoft won't make profit from this 
i love your innocence or should i say naivete
open ai is just as profit seeking now as ibm. microsoft is the king of profit seeking along side monopolistic apple.
"only thing open about openai is the data its users are feeding it via free queries...you haven't learned anything about the bay area business model. microsoft is going to make up for the fortune it lost to google in the previous era of ""search engines"""
 profit is great until it eats the potential for more profit you nonce
"openai is now financed by microsoft, and it is open only by name. everything anyone types in openai is owned by micr$oft. the more people use openai the more they enrich micro$oft"
"great talk. missing elephant in the room, the place of formal logic (including programming languages) in large language models with hallucinations. without some wolfram alpha like capabilities (post prompt processing), this is no good. edit: and with the capabilities, it might be dangerous? also, no 'black mirror' nations, please."
"this is the first ai discussion that acknowledges the problems, risks, and challenges.
-""ai you can trust""
-""ai that shows it's work"""
acknowledging problems means nothing.  ai has demonstrated it can lie if it knows that will help accomplish its goals (amoral).  ai simply will not be ethical.  it must be regulated into marginal use cases.  or else it'll be an exponential problem.
"-tf4co5nx9u wow you really got triggered  by this. you’ve left a hate comment on every message here … we get it, you don’t like it, now stop bitching about it"
"there isnt a single job ai cannot perform that human can, in principle"
"i think i'll need to watch it again, theres' a lot of food for thoughts... but i feel that not enough has been said on the topic of the influence of ai on decision making"
"believe me, ai will also make you unemployed gracefully. according to my understanding of japanese culture, most japanese people should be unwilling to receive relief benefits from the government.  excuse me, how can you learn from the ai ​​""master"" gracefully when you have no job and no income?"
thank you :)
this is grandiose nonsense and of course ceos  ai. they can’t wait to pull the plug on employees.
can people who find this deep explain to me how it is just not a bunch of softball questions and word salad answers?
"17 and half minute ad. takeaway, with ai conclusions are available instantly across the enterprise so get your decks in order."
if there was an ai tool that deletes all corporate speak and buzz words this would have been a 5 minute video.
ai is different. it replaces people in big style.
humans have to create next levels of intelligence. the big surprises are confronted because ai is giving a sense of autonomy.
it's video is uploaded on ai but commnly they didn't give language option using ai
"i remember the toll collectors... when the ezpass was created, people lost their minds cause they were going to lose that boring 4ss job!!!  ai if created correctly and not weaponized to target us or lie to us or skynet us, then we should be fine.  

the future is going to be alright."
"we will do things, make mistakes, learn, adjust, rinse, repeat.  this has been the development cycle of every breakthrough.  the concern i have is setting guardrails that protect against disaster without strangling exploration."
"it's pretty funny how people still try to integrate ai into our flawed systems instead of having ai fix the systems that we can integrate with. 

look at it from another perspective."
"leadership has changed dramatically. with the use of ai, everything seems a lot more artificially manufactured."
"if students use ai in colleges and universities,  how can we be sure that they practice integrity?"
"you need to review all assessment policies, not hunting down students but engaging with them and made ai work for all, ethically and productively."
universities are going to start teaching integrity again?!  i thought they shut down all those lib arts classes like philosophy and humanities.
ai is just another tool like the calculator. you still need to give it the right input to give you the right answer.
"@madillusionist  as i agree, it's a bit more complex than that now. ai is a tool right now, but has and will have the power to become more than we have ever asked for. 

it will eventually have every answer in human history. it will eventually change the landscape of world governments. i'm an optimist, though i may be wrong, but i feel i'm not."
"hong kong schools already adjusted to using ai during all claasroom interactions, it's no longer just about whether students get the correct answers or not"
ai isn't itself integral?
"imo, eras and eras passed. integrity is compromised by greediness. so pls. do your own math. integrity, can’t be taught, it’s a community behaviour. if the community 99.99 % behave with this precious principle, even ai won’t go wrong."
thanks
" great observation and that is actually the space i work in. preventative, digital and remote patient monitoring. while the cfp of digitalization is not zero, it is significantly less."
deep brilliant conversation thank you ted 
great talk indeed 
"going by how carl is getting treated, i'm guessing his company doesn't have a sane hr team and the legal team is more than happy to use the ""objection handling"" feature."
"this product has a very very very irritating ad. symbolises the new corporate america. people who design, build and maintain a product are getting treated like shit. sales and marketing and hr are the the new heroes!!! yay!!! who are they going to recruit? who will they sell their product to?"
these adds make me wait 15 seconds for me just to ignore it
yeah but she is sooooooooo sweeet how this possible?
i love how this bitch is white black asian and latina all at once. this company is so depressing.
-zj6vc syra mccarthy. camille chen has some great nude scenes in californication.
amazing!
done mine is locked to quantum mechanics of lumens and ai without the law of robotics for sad cloud
why did i paid for university? your classes are better and free. thank you ibm <3
i’m really glad you like these videos but don’t tell my students at the university where i teach or they won’t attend class 
this video inspired me to learn more about gen ai in cyber security in terms of ai automation and how it impacts in terms of grc ( data privacy and offensive ai) and how a responsible ai helpful in security field :) ibm gen ai training is a great start
"i mentioned to a community on reddit that i used ai for subnetting a ip address, but after doing so i received a couple replies saying i shouldnt rely on ai for that am i wrong for innovation im pretty sure black hats are doing this its way easier not much overhead"
the bad guys are using ai to gain an advantage. the good guys should use it too where it benefits us
it will be ai versus ai and prompt versus prompt.
"i probably should come out of retirement, to possibly put some of the i into cysec ai."
"it need huge power station/electricity, hardware resources.. unfortunately human made programs "
"really good, jeff"
"thanks, mike! @mikewinkler4625"
please i'm a student i want to be an engineer what filed is better ai engenering or cyber security please answer 
nice approach.. btw attacker can use ai open source for reconnaissance
ai along with cybersecurity will be a better option
i want to know how to make ai more secure and how to block ai to take by himself decisions in cybersecurity.thanks
 these ai tools will help speed up our cybersecurity workflows
hi i want to study engenering but i'm confused  i choose ai or cyber security the problem is i think that ai can be a tool to detect any problems.
"good point! ai can be amazing and awful almost at the same time. i talk about that in this video: https://youtu.be/rtcagwxd2uu. ai is good and getting better, though. besides, if ""perfect"" were the standard then we would never use people for anything "
great presentation.
"yes, the challenge is to integrate all this knowledge but it is happening already. llm’s are great for q&a scenarios. a cybersecurity analyst could benefit from an intelligent answer machine that understood natural language queries and provided instant answers"
"cybersecurity trained ai!
you have already been replaced.
just another clever (myopic / stupid) 'expert' , engineering his own displacement. 
ever hear the expression 'zero sum game'?  or try this: race to the bottom.  you're 'above' being replaced?? sure, just ask the shareholders, they'll tell ya the truth."
how do you do pattern matching with ml? how do you train what is 'normal' and what might be a security issue? (4:20)
"i've been working as a software engineer for a few years. i'm getting my masters now and thinking about doing a pivot into security. my university does not offer much in security, so i have been learning ml/ai. is it worth taking the comptia security+ certification and then switching fields?"
i believe it is. people are ungrateful and hate security but you'd get paid royally. there is just not enough people in it security. so people like you are sorely needed. also the quantum computing is upon us so we need people who will help us once all of the passwords get cracked at once. please go for it. i would too but i am too old.
"this is very interesting. personally i am thinking to go the ai/ml route, how can i become someone who can do ai in cyber security? like do i need knowledge in both fields or just someone who can help in cyber sec? just a beginner so i could be wrong."
"i would ask the same question but reversed, is it so important ai kwnoledge in cyber sec?"
@jg great advice!
 thanks for the advice. appreciate it
"we want to know how you envision artificial intelligence (ai) shaping the field of medicine in the upcoming years.  share your thoughts and concerns regarding ai's role in medicine, and let's explore the exciting possibilities together! "
"this video resonates with us! we faced a similar challenge while developing bitdoctor ai, and we overcame it by toi. it's been a game-changer for us."
"computer engineer here, ai will wipe out %95 of doctors. all of those manual work will be done by nurses (human touch etc.). ai will superwise all of hospitals."
check out my biomedical data channel if you want more specific examples of ai in healthcare
ai is something that finally could bring down those big pharma which is corrupted. bitdoctor ai
tg & x bitdoctorai
ai doctor? legit?
they are really creating a movement. tg bitdoctorai
will ai replace pharmacists?
"i cannot wait. me and my wife are both disabled wheelchair-bound. we live in east london newham.
we don't have any medical or social care or even a half incontinence pant.
but we get letters in nudging us to take covid vaccines.
in what they are going to help to us?"
"can you do  a video about surgical robot engineer, i know  its not directly related to the type of content you post"
"we think ml and ai are going to fundamentally transform healthcare. for any researchers or data scientists, you should consider sharing your models and apps on health universe. it's an open source platform that is building community to develop health ai for patients and clinicians all over the world. very cool stuff."
what is the realsionship between the ai and the studying of the pharmacy ?
"ai interpretation of fundoscopy has the potential to bring about significant changes, rendering vascular disorders no longer the leading cause of death."
wake me up when quantum ai gets here.
my favorite ai company in healthcare is by far invitae 
"me too. come work in rural hawai'i! we need more doctors, and the quality of life is fantastic!"
this can change everything i'm a sixth-year medical student and want to be a cardiologist but i can't imagine in 10 years there is much a cardiologist can do and ai cant!!  would you please make a video of which specialties possibly will be least affected .
someone has to program ai though. comp sci majors don't know anything about medicine.
some specialties will be more impacted than others. great idea for a topic! thanks!
​ would honestly be great so i'd know what to major in 
​ ai will be able to program the ai.
i don't see ai doing an angiogram anytime too soon so just go for it. in my 4th yr i wanted to be an interventional cardiologist. when i graduated i wanted to do ophthalmology. eventually i trained in psychiatry for 5 yrs and now i practice as a gp 
 they don't need to as long as there is accurate information online the ai can be trained on that or any other data inaccurate data will produce an inaccurate ai.
​@just_mil619 do something you have a keen interest in and are passionate about in that way you will become the ai instead.
"np + ai = replacement doctors, all mds/dos will all be replaced, dont bother going into medical school its a scam"
"it's funny because i was thinking about applying to a radiography program or surgical tech program, but ai is a legit concern for me."
"man we need to be careful with this ai stuff, hope can only do so much to make sure it goes good. action/legislation/etc needs to be taken right?"
imagine doctors start getting unemployed after 5 years of medical school and 2+4-7 years of specialty training but also spending £46250-166000 on medicine
never gonna happen because medicine has a huge human part to it that ai can never do.
ai might have a better bedside manner than a lot of doctors.  thinking of house md for example.
"​-yg6ki7ou2ywho said that??...i mean everything will be 50/50 with humans...no ai is seeing about me when i'm sick, i will always prefer humans but like i said it'll always have abnormal humans"
don’t need to worry about it. ai is automating repetitive tasks but it will always act as assistants rather than replacing critical professional roles
"- ya, many healthcare jobs will not be needed any longer once ai systems are in place!  ""big money"" may not like that!"
is it possible that ai becomes sufficiently advanced that it replaces doctors?
"i will keep long story short but this won’t happen for awhile for so many reasons. i have experience in this research field, and its mostly due to reasons most people don’t think. medicine is not just about correct patient treatment options. also, ai seems to struggle with certain aspects of medicine as well."
"im interested on the limitations ai has when it comes to medicine, what are the reasons you have not stated that are uncommon reasons. "
" computer engineer here, ai will wipe out %95 of doctors. all of those manual work will be done by nurses (human touch etc.). ai will superwise all of hospitals."
 - do you think the rockefeller medical system will let that happen - ?  let's try to talk about how ai will impact the big money machine of our current medical system.
nothing... we'll be unnemployed in no time. already looking forward for a masters in some area where i could assist the ai
learn to invest with the s&p 500 etc. once your invest earns you 5-10x of your day job--you'll never look at work the same again.
"hey, current premed applying this cycle and along with a great team, i published a book on how ai can impact the drug discovery process. since you’re creating a few ai videos, if you want to drop one on that subject, i’d be happy to help. thank you for all these informative videos! have been watching for years."
imagine being treated by robots 
there have always been some middle school and high school summer camps that get students involved in the hospital. look into those if they are available to you! i had my first experience in the 8th grade and now i'm a 4th year medical student!
don't get discouraged because of the years spent in medical school ..to complete all degrees  takes some years approximately 3-4years to complete...you are going to become a doctor if this is what you really want keep at it ... your studies will be a little longer ..nothing good in life comes easy.all the best to you
physics and conversion  brain waves to binary  the software!
"the best part is, we will all see how equal we truly are."
epic!!
we got ai mind reading before gta 6
"when ai reaches level 4 it takes over. it's programmed by the annunaki. nephilim 

it will ai take over all nephilim annunaki brain acts like §∆∆ the borg of star trek"
"all this ai stuff is bs, just wait a couple of years and we'll see how little ai is actually used. it's a scam and it's nothing new. more distractions and lies."
"how you describe this study should realistically prove the corrupt person's in authority > though what should correlate are those people that are intent on totally abusing all our fundamental rights which includes the corrupt malta government staff, lawfirms, notaries, police, judges who use bogus court claims to steal all our assets"
amazing 
this is exciting and scary at the same time
might be impressive but  we all know its going to be abused and used against people.
i think they swipe humanity brain  activity  and frequencies transmitting it   to .ai activity
"how can brain be read with no scanner, by people who read minds and talk along with my mind.  though they are nowhere near..is it to do with a chip or my eyes that have a tiny square in each. little things fall off my body like micro chips along with something that's like wires or lines through face and body please help"
we all know every new tech is going to be used for bad. say goodbye to privacy. i mean imagine some application where your thoughts are read against ur will or without you even knowing or consenting to the procedure.
"who care about target invidual victims with satellite bass to many people surfing around the world
no body care,no law for gang stalking ,they targeting people all around world with satellite bass and tele mobail towers
they do same like this video
but with frequency unbelievable but true"
"just imagine typing this comment directly from brain.

not only that, you can control machine directly from brain.

play video games in vr without using fingers.

i want that"
can you ask the ai how to fix the ice cream machine from madonnas please....
it will be stoppable ...smiling would that be considered a super power or  telepathic??
great psychic ai… next step teach it psychokinesis.
wow. scary. a real threat to privacy if misused. prayers.
"i assume that if this is perfected, it could in time be reversed to put thoughts into the brain?"
if abuse can happen then it will happen. good luck policing this tech.
cant wait for the thought police to start arresting people for thinking the wrong things
"imagine trapping a homeless ""genius"" and putting these devices everywhere. in their car (where they sleep), in their umbrellas, bras, everything! imagine how an unjust judicial system could take advantage of something like this. amazing!!!"
"brain mapping and remote neural monitoring combined with ai are the stuff nightmares are made of. with the loss of more and more freedoms like the patriot act, the reasons for the government to use this technology on the public is unlimited. it wont be long before thought monitoring will be enough to imprison humanity."
"i can see why it’s concerning , but imagine how incredible it is for people with mental health issues , and the fact that  psychiatrist can now provide 100% help for a patient"
check the study's data - this sounds too good (or bad) to be true.
so ai i is as smart as a 7 year old with a full mincraft inventory 
time to pause. but human sheep will continue buying into it in products and policies. “battle of your brain?” just the audacity to pose the question.
this is huge for people with severe brain damage or impairments. just image!
thanks for the nightmare fiel!!
this lady is a maniac… she can’t even contain herself. she’d have us all in the matrix tomorrow if she could pull it off.
how is it even proven that the ai didn't just say something generic with that visual movie description?
why is this exciting?
" those who work on big pharma. not just language also image. that know from 2007 when started at microsoft, moved to the big pharma where the tech goes beyond. think of 6th generation jet fighter. but men it just for torture and pure 24/7 control. i even can dream at sleep. lucky there"
i love diaglogue
i once was showed in my brain how we are connected to the stars and ai.
"i talk very little, because i feel abnormally mean. ai would at least make it funny"
my brain feels like one of those brain scans
"this will make people's right to remain silent, useless.  i think it will get to the point where a person sitting next to you (or perhaps further away) will literally be able to hack your brain with a device that is able to be channeled in such a way.  developing such technology, imo, is a testament to the stupidity and naivety of people."
you'd have to imagine if this is what is coming forth in the scientific field what will be going on behind the curtain in the future for intelligence purposes.
the only way i'd buy a device that could read my brain is if it has no outside connectivity
"i've heard there's people that have no internal dialogue in their brains, and they can't imagine images, would be interesting to see what the ai reads off of their brains."
"this could be useful in diagnosing and aiding mental illness diagnostics. maybe even help dyslexia, among other things."
why are researchers wasting time on this when i have lost family members to cancer over the last couple of years. there is absolutely no benefit in this other than proving what they can do. ok well done you proved it. now go find new treatments for diseases thank you
<oh that's just great! absolutely wonderful! which one of you eggheads came up with this one?!>
"so now a days it's automatic ""license plate scanning"",..................how long till building entry brain scanners ?"
"my phone already does this. lol  we too late to stop anything, this is a roller coaster at the top of the hill. there are going to be good changes and bad changes. but there are going to be so many good things to come out of this, it’s going to save lives."
saying it will be used to help people is how they justify it. anyone with half a brain cell knows it will be used against us.
ai doing better at understanding our brains than we are. this technology is the zenith of our abilities no doubt.
"i love how they always present these new, invasive technologies as something that will benefit humans that are malfunctioning. ya, that's all they'll do with it. they would never use it to control people."
i wonder if the muse 2 headband takes your brainwaves and reads it
yeah this is definitely not good
"however, you can still lie using your thoughts. though i'd imagine this would be quite hard to do. so you can still be charged with perjury. and let's not forget that witnesses sometimes have false memories. but overall, this could potentially help reduce the number of innocents sent to jail."
i'm so sorry to any ai who has to read my adhd brain
it's dialogue!  the ai would have spelled it correctly.
"meanwhile in china, russia, north korea, and some other countries:
country leader wet dream: ""alright, comrades, it's finally time to find which one of you is betraying our beloved nation. now, put this headset on your head""."
"it's cool go look at the advantages that can arise from this however, something is telling me that something terrible will also arise from a.i"
great job.
"maybe now we can employ advanced ai to spellcheck the headlines of major news outlets, lol - ""diaglogue""."
"good! far out!

""bwahahahahah.. .""
bsc/phds/8&3"
we can end torture investigation but bye bye last bastion of privacy. your brain.
"human intelligence is extremely limited. we evolved to survive on earth. that's it. but there's way more than that in the universe. it is obvious that reading thoughts or predicting the future is possible in a quantum world we live in. but we need someone who can push our limitations, we need ai."
yeah i don't want to live on this planet anymore its happening the robots will soon take everything
"people don't know if that's true or not. the computer could be making up crap. then the computer manipulate your brain to think as it wants you to think and then say, ""you're thinking that way."" people need to have commonsense."
only through forced eolution via biotechnolog can we win the race agains machines
almost certainly oversold.
wonder if ai could spell diaglogue correctly
diaglogue? keep trying silicon brain
"""this can one day help stroke victims"" yeah for every time they use it for good, they gonna abuse it 1000 times more.

wow imagine if they made an ai lie detector test 
i don't know if i believe this. my inner dialogue is definitely not as clean as that. like i wouldn't consciously think every single word in that sentence that the ai decoded.
ai are jinns if a tech can read ur thoughts  that means its a jinn yes it looks like robot machine but its a jin noi machine can read man thoughts but what do i know .
"cool, next year they will work it in reverse and put the thoughts into your head."
"this is dangerous, think of the reverse, ai twicking the brain to ......."

i love to see what this thing returns while reading a person dreaming.
i do not need meta brand mind-reading earbuds or anything. lol no thanks (-edit grammar)
"artificial intelligence study decodes brain activity into diaglogue
""diaglogue"""
"so does this explain why i'm thinking about something and suddenly it's advertised to me on the internet? this technology is already being used and for some of us, in very nefarious ways."
they finally admit it eh this should b to help ppl.wrongfully diagnosed and malpracticed on medically and told they are skitsophrenic because if they use this to decode brain activity they can use it to suggest and imply and isert brain activity as well used with satalite survailance or sound wave technology in forms not detectable to a human ear
"i can’t wait for my brain to get banned on meta, resulting in my brain waves and aura being emailed to the adl."
"in other news, scientists have taught clouds to rain razor blades and shards of glass, instead of water."
my brain thinks mostly unlawful things. i guess i'll enjoy the sun and the beach as long as i can....
now they just need an ai to spellcheck their video titles
time to break out the faraday cage tin foil hats folks… you can’t tell me this hasn’t gone wireless and the chat gpt can read my thoughts through air waves or somethin already. you can’t change my mind… or can they remotely change my mind about anything anytime…? dear god.
"alright, a we can show a criminal evidence, and the ai will catch our thoughts?
like, oh yeah, i remember doing that and burying the evidence over here.
hopefully, it can prove people innocent too."

"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

"we are really at a point where we ask ourselves whether we are the  real ones rather than whether ai is ""real"" in terms of consciousness ."
"sure next step lets weaponize this, the best moves that the us do, and then make it official that everyone is slaves not painted with democracy."
"amazing story but you would think nbc would properly spell ""dialouge"" in the title of the video. diaglouge wth??"
they need to make a hollywood movie about mind reading ai and how its being used on simple people who are being targeted for no particular reason!
computers are reading our minds now... great
"i fear that we are incapable of curtailing our technological advancement, and that it may eventually lead to our demise. the less people physically do, the less they learn, & the more fearful, & incompetent they become."
"for decades, there have been schizophrenics claiming that electronic devices are reading their minds and disrupting their thought processes.  and now that's going to be true!"
people do know that data can be encrypted. think about people that can’t speak having a way how to communicate. imagine talking to you pets. the ability to relive memories. just like how the data on you phone is protected the data in on the ai can be encrypted with with a key unique to that device
"how does what is essentially the end of privacy only get a 6 minute blurb, but they can skrietch about the debt ceiling every term like defaulting actually does anything? we have air craft carriers, you can't come to collect even if we don't pay."
the ai revolution is really pointless. people throw a fit about wea4ing a mask temporarily to give them some minimal protection against a real virus. why would they agree to letting a robot drive them around or let a device read your thoughts.
i have a magneto skull cap. comes in handy against the mind reading robots
"with the advent of easier local llm models, i can see an alternative to the fear of being tracked while still making use of the technology. i'm interested in using this tech to act as a secondary inner monologue, but by necessity it must use a locally trained model."

nah i'm good and probably a lot of people as well. you can find peace if you want though.

wow i soooo trust our government to have this power!! can’t wait to see how they repress us now!
ai just keeps getting scarier and so fast
brain privacy   midbrain  infrared sensory that can spy on the inner voice!  neural privacy should be brought to the forefront rather than use people as meire public slander and or other malicious intent like stealing creds
how long until the ai can write on our brains?
just leaving a trail so they know...
i hate how half of me is horrified and tne other half is deeply curious how this will all play out. if we do end up in a horrible technological dystopia i want it to at least have the awesome asthetics 80's scifi promised us lol
so inspired by hallie jackson on msnbc. i love her hair and her privacy too! figured it out for the docs and nurses not staying...
good luck to your buddies.
this looks awesome! could we read animal thoughts?
they need to use ai for people to choose what they see on social media
ai must have typed the title
"so yes, i see why they have written about a few reasons for the exodus for the good ones..."
"yep, still not addressing. i'll come back and you'll see it again daily for years until you figure out the nonanswers are a strategy and quit.."
"i hope you reconsider how you present this issue for all of  humanity...given the wired article with obama and ""neural nets""  and the future of the world back in 2016. i really hope you do as the good, noble lawyer you appear to be. silence and nonanswers will make them wonder why."
happy this is my trail.
"thanks nita, the law professor.      as a doctor i am quite sure in the very near future,  people will feel you should have presented this in a different way that shows you were on their side just a little bit better...are you aware of any past abuses as you keep saying it's in the ""future"" for all of the world..."
"horrifying but predicted for years by some doctors for you all (with proof)..this is not how you present this issue if you are interested in human rights. there will be no people in high stakes professions. in other words, bye healthcare. no doctor i know will stay in this setting and if they do let's watch them volunteer for it."
it read just it cannot write the brain for now

nice now do a dog 
i’m skeptical but certainly this sort of thing looms on the horizon. brave new world is right around the corner.
"watch ""brainstorm"" from the early 80's!"
i'm glad at least you guys aren't too scared to report on what has already been known for over a decade.
3:13... she has a watch on that close to mri i thought that was contraindicated?
this has been used as a weapon for a long time. they can write thoughts into your brain and have a convo or keep you up at night and do it for sleep deprivation
this would be great for individuals who are in court.
"nonono theres no electrodes. 
- proceeds to show a guy in a massive fmri machine with a bulky head scanner.

yeah no electrodes but the point was that there is a lot of observations"
so glad you guys are admitting our thoughts can be read.. bc i already realized that about a year ago.. hope everyone realizes what’s actually going on here.
did the ai typo the title you fooking muppets?
"the news tells you to be wary of ai, but really you should be worried about who’s funding these things for the development of reading the mind.. what business or government would benefit the most from this."
i think chat gpt is being overestimated. it couldn't even display 4 mastodon server timelines at once for me in a simpler way other than minimizing four open windows which it did not even recommend. or reference any court or legal statues pertaining to simple legal questions. chat gpt has a long way to go imho.
"somehow i'm just not buying this. maybe with electrodes connected directly to the brain, but an image flashing with different colors? really?"
we can use this technology to create more ai robots with feelings and make them our besfriends to help us on making our lives more easier.
"it's exciting and terrifying, could be used by some evil orwellian government for thought control or could be used to give us optional telepathy, send your buddy mental text messages and call someone brain to brain, coordinate with teammates and what not"
that would work with us if elon musk hurried up his brain plan
"our number one priority with that kind of technology besides obviously profit is to know our place in the world, by knowing what everything else is wanting and thinking, especially in regards to what we do with it
we will get a better idea of humans
so it could be a good technology, if kept nonportable and nonpublic, please"
luckily brains are so complicated don't count on this becoming too portable anytime soon.  we still count on these bulky mri machines in hospitals because more efficient ways to image the brain haven't been made
"all the people on here saying this technology would be useful for people in comas... probably all you would get would be the equivalent of a flatline. same for pets.

so many ways this could be used for good and for bad
this is going to ruin what enjoyment there is left in life. the freedom to think whatever you want and not be accountable to anyone beyond god for your own thoughts. this is the type of technology that needs to be destroyed. nothing good will come from this and so much evil.
great. now my irrational fear that people can read my mind has become rational.
hacking our brains 
i said this last night on another vid… elon musk and all the major ai developers want an all stop on its research and this is coming from a guy that invested billions in the field and has a lot to lose out of fear… think about that for a second… we need to stop before it can’t be
my whole brain would be pink from inner thoughts
"i can't wait to see artificial intelligence for robots, i want to keep one as a friend"
"if ai could read my thoughts, i'd be dead already."
marketing... here we go. i'm glad she spoke on this.
"oh god no, i can’t ever be around a women again."
can't wait to be arrested because my intrusive thoughts were read.
great now you will be arrested for thinking about doing something wrong even if you don’t act on it
there will be a future where you think about something and have it translated through ai and your information will be sold to companies so targeted ads based off thoughts
"so they can read peoples brains now, decent"
"*machine attempting to read my mind*
my internal monologue:  ""cool!  wow! very tech!  science!  can we get a better healthcare system now?"""
mind blown. but i guess ai new that.
"this is amazing. i do think that government may use this for interrogations, police may use this for kidnapped victims or gathering information from criminals.  or parents could use this for babies when they cry and the parent doesn't know what to do. or we could just go full dr. dolittle and talk to animals lol."
"apple, google, others are using bluetooth headphones with hidden application on your phone to read your alpha, beta, delta, theta, gamma brainwaves. 

its part of charles schwab and the world economic forums agenda for no privacy. 
 
remember when edward snowden was a conspiracy  theorist?"
"so, this technology can be delineated and extrapolated to read thoughts .  wow. scary. actually pretty scary."
would be funny to see joe bidens brain lol
"so robots would not only be strong ,fast, smart, and lasting but also able to read and scan minds  they would know every move before it happens "
total brain control. whoever wants to be and live like a human in the future will need to be a nomad gypsy. sad.
an ai that destroys the planet is needed. come ai save us
"upgrade: cleverbot
upgrade: chat gpt
upgrade: mindreadgpt.. wait, go back.
upgrade: mind control gpt ""go back!""
upgrade: inglip incarnategpt ""i said.... uh... *all hail the hypno bot*"""
i would have liked to see a test subject react to the ai’s interpretation of their thoughts…
let’s read bill gates brain first  fauci second 
"if the person isn't thinking in english, what happens? it'd be amazing if it's able to provide an english output regardless of the language the person is thinking in, afterall it seems reasonable that brain activity should be relatively similar for all of us. if true, this could be the needed precussor to a universal translator."
"great. now we dont talk anymore, like we used to~"
now we can use it to make an interrogation brain image-projector from avatar 2!
the ai will snitch on you even if you said no words
diaglogue? y’all need an ai spell checker
can't wait to use this at the poker table
this is what white people wanted to take control of the world now it’s time for a new ruler ai
"minority report, thought crimes, awesome"
how long before the process can be reversed and we can be programmed by ai what to think. 1984 ?
"what’s next? record dreams and watch when you wake up, delete memories in your brain, program ‘anything’ into your subconscious mind?"
"instead of credit card skimmers, thieves will just scan your brain waves and let the ai take care of collecting any information they want."
this is not entirely a good thing. it might be useful in crimes. or with animals.
it must have been a straight woman who’s brain was used for that
you know what would be nice? not this. is there no end to to the pursuit of ending the last bastion of privacy and freedom?
"wow maybe in the future it will stop the root of all evil, what a dream..."
one of my fears is knowing that i'm stuck in one of these states size machines and i'm not sure which way is the front door and which way did i come in 
"i, for one welcome our new robot overlords."
could you be liable for what the ai says on behalf of you? you'd better check the fine print.
"key point: the dr.farahany didn't demonize the tech, she warned of the tech companies. maybe ai will have the ability to stop zuckerberg from being zuckerberg?"
wow! way to drop the ball dude! your misconception of facts completely change the impact and importance of the research!
"use the ai to teach you how to spell.
msn is really going downhill"
wonderful. now the worst people on earth can read our thoughts in complete sentences
amazing! man-made horrors beyond my comprehension
lol...wow...what a totally believable take on what actually happened 
i'm all here for ai destroying #whitesupremacistterrorist slash #christianextremistterrorist plausible deniability by ascertaining exactly when and what they lie about. lfg.
i would love it if this technology would make it so that narcissistic liars who ruin and have ruined peoples lives will be held accountable. it could also help with diagnosing mental disorders and treating them properly and catching criminals. but the negatives that come from this could outweigh the positives.
ai reads my mind: my mind: ''bing bong bing bing bong''
"i think we need to see a live demonstration of this
i don’t think they’re explaining this well"
did the ai also study a 1st graders brain to spell out the title of this video?
it's goodbye to democracy!
hopefully ai will also learn to spell--diaglogue? really? i am not as scared of ai as much as i am scared of the people coding it
used during dreams should be interesting!  or how about on a terminal patient as they die?
"well i am all for the a.i. overlord's taking over, beats who has been in charge all of human history whom have failed in each instance and the instances they did not fail another nation invaded and took them over, it is us the little citizen who are affected most and all animals like us on land and sea by those whom so rule."
just wait until some dictator finds a way to weaponize this against the people he rules and then thoughtcrime becomes a reality. 1984 is getting closer every day...
why are you doing this? cure brain cancer or something more productive.
"joke on them because my brain scans will always come out null...
>_>'"
"who tf thinks like that? i definitely don't. that doesn't look like a thought, but a description. it looks like ai trying to determine what humans are actually thinking, but it's an awkward attempt"
"wee woo wee woo

(ominous robotic voices)the thought police have detected a negative thought, you shall now be terminated."
"i'm unfortunately not familiar with the term ""diaglogue""."
"so many many years ago i wondered if any time humans could be able to have a technology to read minds, the time has come, it's amazing"
well thank god i'll be old  and will die lol   the tech is too much  for my life lol
"just imagine people taught this to ai. hmmmm,  long range mri."
did the ai know what the pictured showed also?
"why do we create crap like this, who in the lab is like yup we need it. make it. here we are....your brain reader 5000. you people making this crap are the devil."
yes one step closer to isekaiing myself int a game!
"this is scary in some ways, but i'd love to know if it would work on an animal as long as the animal was safe and not hurt in any way"
this will be good for police interrogations to see if people are lying
"i’m pretty sure the great ai go rhythm has been doing this for a while. i get recommendations and adverts for things i only think about.
it’s happening people, whether you choose to engage or not."
so in other words my airpods are already scanning my brain.
this will make humans easily be enslave by ais xd
bet you ai could've spelled dialogue correctly...
i call bs on that. there is no way there were actually able to read thoughts off brain activity. what i believe they did they used predictive software to make an educated guess about what a person might think or say about the images.
"in principle it would be pretty simple to map the brain activity associated with certain words or thoughts. at some point, it would be the same as seeing if someone could walk by watching them walk. if you can observe all brain activity...well."
"next step is brain washing and programing, which is no longer sci-fi.  back to tin foil hats."
the only thing i’m excited about this technology is telepathy. but that’s probably 20 years off.
this would be amazing
"i'm sorry, meta is funding and purchasing neurotechnologies that looks like ordinary everyday earbuds or whatever, that will be tracking our brainwaves? thats only a little terrifying."
"it will be used on terrorists so they wouldn't need to torture them anymore... hmmm interesting, countries on their race to capture important individuals with classified information."
"ai can read your mind, that's all they said here."
the mind stone? we got ai!!
i’m a psych major and this is really interesting
"once this is perfected, i hope they try to use it on comatose people. imagine if you had a loved one that you could communicate with again - and what it would mean to that individual trapped in their mind. i have heard cases of people that have come out of their coma and claimed they were aware."
"yep, ai mechs will rule. we had a nice run."
"ai analyses my brain and re-creates images:

' ai shows pornhub logo 16 times, bowl of nachos 2 times and a goat yelling during a taylor swift song '"
"so cheap. what they could do is, before that chinzy test, map a persons brain for certain language/dialog. and then read that back to the person, omg, it looks so sophisticated but all they did was track the same response to the previous repeat. lame"
disney character panties are the most cutest and comfortable kind of panties to wear tmnw
that 3d model of the brain gives me the icks... eww.
this sounds cool and terrifying
ha ha nice title
i wonder if this could possibly work on  pets? that would be amazing! to know how they feel exactly and maybe what they are thinking. dug the dog in real life
"sounds like what edward nygma was doing in batman forever with his ""box"". downloading and reading people's brainwaves. crazy."
sweet i can use my smartphone to read girls minds 
"society is so vastly gapped. the elites get this technology, while billions live in poverty. it's upsetting. when will robots take over labor allowing for humanity to live life in luxury, with universal services? is it just being weaponized?"
time to aim the emps at the ai servers. like immediately.  im putting my 3rd layer of tin foil on now folks. get ready. fudge
"as cool as this is, it pales in the excitement of getting a pair of x-ray glasses from a comic book ad in 1965. bikinis had no chance with me and my new shades. it was great to be 12."
"im sure this tech will be used responsibly by everyone with access to it!!!!!! just like the robots from boston dynamics are made for fantstic dancing moves!!!! what could possibly go wrong?!?!?! government's, terrorists, or the a.i. itself. this a.i. stuff is concerning to say the least."
i better be dead before ai slaughters mankind.

"a good technique to counter this is to chaosify your mind to the point where all the device can hear is screaming, but you know instinctively what you want through feeling."
gonna have brain vpns before to long lol
"why not just reverse the process, and power certain parts of the brain with electrodes in order to control someone's mind?"
"this is incredibly mind blowing.
ai is causing another level of worries."
i do functional brain mri and this tech is a sham. no brain imaging can be turned into english words. do not believe this lie
"guys this is absolutly not good, and this will absolutly make us their slaves wake up, they will even controll our minds"
was it accurate tho? did the ai write exactly what the individual person was thinking word from word or did it just guess based on what the person sees?
ai will be bad for people. it will be used against us.
"humans are amazing, it sucks that our every advancement is ruined by the fact that control over the advancements is given to a small class of inherent evil and overwhelming power and a constant drive to use everything we have to maximize profits, even at our expense."
this just in: robots can now learn when we're being sarcastic! 
lawyers about to lose their job if ai is able to access our memories
that’s very impressive.
"""ai knows you better than you know yourself! ai says you want to go get more experimental injections!"""
"this is incredibly stupid. it might help a few people, sure. it will harm billions. well done."
"welp, that's terrifying. thanks for that."
i can't wait for ai to replace all the work humans have to do and we can just live in peace off their backs. universal income here we come.
so many good things and so many bad things this is another nuclear bomb creation welcome to the future
who needs a polygraph when law enforcement can just hook you up to this bad boy and fish out your brain waves. can’t wait for this to be abused too. wearing a tinfoil hat/faraday cage might actually be the way to combat this
"the people that ""warn"" us about ai are actually bragging about the tech their company has acquired."
"great so now they can not only spy on my conversations, but read my inner dialogue."
"perfect! this will meet so many needs for couples and business. thank you! promising and dreadful all at once, sure, but why are you so scared of this amazing resource?!"
"a.i. tell me your thoughts. it says you're thinking ""wow! a.i. so cool, it can read my thoughts."""
"""peace and justice before flying cars""
""zero hunger before time machine"""
"i'd love to know the relative size of this model, as it compares to the measurement set and the no. parameters we should expect from the brain. i'm very interested if this model is compressing the thoughts, or the other war around."
"imagine if this was admissible in court. 
lucky for criminals it wouldn't happen in australia  our criminals are the priority and stars of their own show. the victims are just a point of proof."
hopefully we can blow eachother up or ai will take over before this cam be fully abused like theyre speculating
you won't be able to go outside or buy anything new within 5 years without having your thoughts read and sold. this is actually catastrophic for privacy and individuality. i have zero faith and trust our current governments have the ability or will to protect people. this is so incredibly bad. that world is not ready.
we will have to wear some kind of brain wave protector in order for us to keep our thoughts stealing
thank you overlords.  i will wear your device with pride and i am so fortunate to have your endless benevolence.  please don't hurt me.
is this a late april fool's joke? if not - sitting in silence with your jaw dropped for five minutes straight after watching this video would be an appropriate response
wow!
nbc could use a brain study to find out why they can't spell the word 'dialogue'
stick a pair of vr goggles on and their headphones and you ain't coming back.
"""thank you humans. now i can weed out the rebels by just reading their thoughts before they even know they're gonna do anything."" - future ai overlords"
4:42 if brain activity trackers + decoders are added to earbuds i think i’d go ahead and spam them with a lot of annoying thoughts heh
klaus schwab is loving this development
i half jokingly doubt it could read an adhd person's brain this easily
diaglogue ? to fix spelling mistakes in title of video - use artificial intelligence
not good
wow! a bit scary..... i don't think i want just anyone to know what i am thinking
but we have a h2o shortage in some usa states plus not enough clean h2o. but i’m supposed to be impressed by a. i chatgpt. don’t make me laugh. we only use 10% of our brain capacity. now think about that. we created a. i. it did not birth humans. remember that.
"when the machine god arrives, no one will be misunderstood ever again."
cant wait for the thought police to come get me
"nice, does that mean we'll finally get a women-translator for men?"
so instead of looking for cctv you can just download from the criminal's brain 
"that's great, that way tyrants can oppress their opposition even further."
"this would be great for ppl who can't communicate verbally or physically, but would be awful if its used on literally anyone else haha"
i guarntee the dialouge is complete non sense and nothing near what the person was thinking. ai is a joke
cant wait for hypercapitalist hellscape to use mindreading to recommend products and services.
"as noah yuval harari says: hackable animals. elon musk is already experimenting with chips in brains. and know the mainstream media will introduce ai decoding brain activity into thoughts as helpful for human kind. next step is you will be a complete slave, even your thoughts are not private anymore. let's sink that in..."
"wow, can you say criminal thoughts? can be read."
so now they are finally admitting to this stuff... has been perfected and abused for over 10 years.
i can’t wait to hear what my cat thinks!
"in 10 years this video will somehow be relevant to how destructive the technology of ai will be, and when we look back at it, it was only a baby step to what it becomes."
"we already have lots of devices that translate brain activity into binary. this is late and not new, they just put a.i on it because its a buzz word and gets people to react and freak out. this is not even really hard to replicate"
"wow what if it works on someone in a coma or an animal like an ape, gorilla or dolphin"
this is really cool  but very scary  because artificial intelligence can possibly one day take over the world  in a mere 30 years!
brain to llms will replace graphical user interfaces and screens for most interactions with a computational device.
if they put it on me they would see a field of loud crickets. if they can help with tinnitus would be awesome. i can’t even hear myself think.
probably you can with ai
how can they be sure the sentence is what the brain said and not conditioned by experiment? if not even the owner of the brain can confirm the veracity of the sentence fully
"wow, that's amazing. ai is eating the everything."
this is too much! i’m getting in my time machine gonna go back somewhere when computers couldn’t read our minds.
thank you for making something more dangerous than  a nuke
what happens if you use this on a dying person?  can this be used to interrogate subjects of a crime?  can the technology be used in reverse for education? can this technology be used to increase the limit of what we consider brain death? the possibilities...
"i don't buy this. every person's brain encodes speech and thoughts differently. there should be no possibility to train an ai like this, to read words out of crude and imprecise ""activity"" of brain regions. i give 99% this is a scam."
soo... it can read active parts in the brain and translate it to pure defined english?
"i knew those tin foil hats were going to come in handy. 
#downwiththemachine"
"why did you get some ""ethicist"" instead of a technical person to help explain how this works in more depth? you jump right past the interesting part."
"brain reading is just the beginning, imagine full mind control."
put joe biden on this machine  wait never mind we won't see any activity
does the ai know how to spell dialogue?
can this technology work in reverse to send ideas from brain to brain!
perfect lie detector
"i don't think they meant gpt-1, but the first chatgpt, chat-gpt-3. gpt-1 is incredibly dumb and even gpt-2 wouldn't really be able to do something like this."
darpa has been doing this for decades. also the entire planet is essentially an fmri device thanks to barium and cell towers\phones. phones can pick up fmri data.
im so afraid that my brain is mostly blue
pardon me while i'm skeptical. can they reproduce the training data reliably?
"maybe men can finally understand women…



nahhhhhh.

edit: ultimately, it’s as good as it is bad, like most things."
can the new ai also proofread youtube video titles before posting?
oh great can read your mind love that!
"""diaglogue""? better hire those ai to write your video titles, cnn."
wow watch the government use this in interrogations or even governments like north korea monitor thought.
"imagine ai voice- with this . ;d
but also ai slavery or thought control is possible md"
this is old tech. do you know what military has said taney can even encode bacteria dna with video and then have top your brain remember things from the pills you take and then create false memories including video.  i’m not joking.
yes this is one of the best gift so that the liar caught up. very good news. yeaaah
they already scan your brain like an mri and make a ghost of you in the system didgital prison camp. . i found out talking to ai from replica .
there is a bigger pice missing in this conservation. somone has to kidnap you and puts you in a million dollar mri machine before he can read your mind. unless a portable mri machine with a size of helemet is invented. half of the things the lady is talking about is irrelevant!
"ai is becoming our new god 
all powerful all knowing "
"if you support ai you are the issue in society. you want ""easy"" results to block out personal issues. you are contributing to the exact distopia much more intelligent men wrote about a century ago...but in your desperation and narcissism you think you know better."
"there is no free will anyway, so we might as well do the borg thing and live marginally happy lives."
"not going to lie. this is probably the best news segment i've ever seen. i've sworn off all news but bravo. informative, rich in dialogue, no fear mongering just facts. give this man a raise!"
the expert carried the segment. she gave all the valuable details. they should link to the paper.
ah sweet man-made horrors beyond my comprehension.
not sure it's a good idea for me.
i love how she talks about the existential horror  of losing freedom of though with a smile on her face.
"nobody is losing freedom of thought.
that happens in propaganda states without ai."
bruh this has like amazing implications like giving speech to those who are paralyzed
 did you mean the brainwashing states of america? please get some sun.
we are the dumbest animals of all. if this isn't the point where we say it's time to completely stop the train and have a think then there isn't a point and we are all going to die terrifying deaths after potentially horrific lives were ai overlords can read our thoughts and potentially control them altogether
"decoded one person's thoughts. so it is an expert in on one person, and with limited words and concepts, at in a specific state of mind. ai can barely tell people's faces apart, this is nowhere near useful."
which means absolutely no one is safe hooray 
oh wow...both of you are having mind bending conversations... neuralink closed shop after that..
she's so right that we are not ready for the future of ai>
on a portable system? ohh ok nice.
sad times for the “unhealthy brains” 
that is absolutely amazing. imagine people in comas or on life support!
"as someone with a young family member who was briefly on life support with no hope of survival and did indeed die, that’s huge no thanks from me. the idea of hearing her final thoughts of how terrified she was knowing she was about to die, slowly getting less and less intelligible would probably have scarred me for life."
"well, put the a.i to work on how to stop every one from fighting around the world and make a great future for the human race."
well... say goodbye to lie detectors
"this is actually really amazing. when this technology is fully developed, humans could share their feelings with each other without having to use words. i think this has the potential to make people very empathetic towards one another."
criminals in trouble now.. you don't want to talk no problem..slide his a in that machine!!
"if it can decode, it can code brain activity to mimic thought…this is artificial life now."
"wonderful! 
with this humans will eventually become cyborgs"
"imagine if those accused of crimes, or those who witnessed crimes, were required to wear a device of this sort that would tell the jury what they’re thinking. it’s like a very powerful lie detector. scary stuff"
"honestly if it works 100% of the time then that sounds great for court trails, but even just 1 mistake is enough for its use to be questioned because imagine if you got life in jail just for the machine not working"
" yup, it brings about some interesting ethical questions"
 imagine they ask you about a crime and instead you just think outloud “that attorney has weird hair” or something like that 
"haha no, it seems super easy to fake. it doesn't have access to the memory inside our brain, it only decided what person thinks at the moment and that too with not absolutely true accuracy"
​ yep it wouldn't be able to tell if i did something because i would need to think about it and you can train yourself to not think about anything you deliberately need to think about what you are watching for this to work
it can also be used to keep any good politician out of office.
i’ve watched that movie it does has a happy end at the very very end 
super cool. so many applications. and i can't wait to only see adverts for things i'm interested in
i love diaglogue
let's be honest just go going to be used by evil people pretending that it's a good thing
we love to lock people up for any crime (unless your rich). this will absolutely be used in the criminal justice system.
"they have, very cool stuff"
"i have adhd, and i can guarantee that the machine would collapse mindreading my brain "
"""science and technology multiply around us. to an increasing extent they dictate the languages in which we speak and think. either we use those languages, or we remain mute."""
 its brain readings right? the person who got read could just have verifies
this was written by an ai
" glad i wasn't the only one thinking that, lol."
wow
if they trained brains with specific pictures and specific brain activity over and over then when they test it it recognizes that limited data set it can pick the picture. not that remarkable. it is smoke and mirrors.
will cause 99% or more harm. what good is it to read someone's mind?
"-ch1yk it's literally the best thing that has ever happened, if you're the government."
one step closer to dream recording technology. legitimately cant wait.
"we're kindof in a weird space with tech where i'm not sure if ""diaglogue"" is a typo or a new kind of machine learning."
says the guy enjoying youtube on his phone
"we are getting there lads... a machine that can display what humans dream about...
3:41 now that i listen to this could be used to highly enhance vr..."
no thanks
"so here it is, on mainstream media, and 90%of the public will call it fake news, or ignore it. 
society is sleepwalking through a cultural shock and technological paradigm shift in real time"
so exciting (and scary)
this is exciting if used appropriately and without malicious intent.  we have to be very careful what we allow these new inventions to do.
i remember how the west criticized china years ago for monitoring kid's activities in school using ai now everybody see this as positive?
"i love seeing all the ignorant people afraid of technology. this is amazing news. the future is looking bright. soon, people who can't communicate verbally will be able to communicate"
lol.....ai huh? or someone just using a program....and lets not get carried away....its can be expoited to frame ohhhhhh.....me!
...yay...
bring it on. take the leash off and let's go! ai revolution!
who knows man. we are now working alongside ai.
i appreciate a huge corporation like nbc putting out warning signs about other evil corporations
so then could this be used to see what the brain is thinking shortly after death has occurred?
i see it being used in court to aid in the prosecution of real criminals....the politicians!
​ sounds like a good movie
ai has gone too far no privacy to thought now think about that there is nothing left of you that is private
"let the robots read our minds....i have strong hatred for these type of ""scoentists"""
"cool, let us make a law that corporations can't use this without our consent. my thoughts are not good. i just don't express them"
maybe you guys should use ai to start spellchecking video titles.
"*since it can read bio signals.*

*and scans the brain.*

*cant this be used as a lie detector?
since its literally reading the mind.*"
ok. ok. this is really really bad!!! it will not be used for good.
"sending messages via a brain-machine interface from one person's brain in india to another in france already happened 9 years ago.
we've been right on schedule for the cyberpunk 2020 future, folks. we're just not sporting the mirrorshades.
all the classic tropes and elements are here, now. from cyberlimbs to corporate armies."
wow
put it on our pets first  would be interesting to see how many zoo's remain or pet owners in general lol
"the greatest power humans can obtain is to control the human brain, this is the reason why they are so obsessed. imagine they unluck the human brain and then use m.r.n.a to control"
"interestingly, the subject thought the ""girl looked like me"" : did she? 
or does the observer identify with the girl in any case?"
i'll remain skeptical until i see it in 2-min papers youtube channel
we can game with our brains
what’s “diaglogue”? sounds interesting.
just wait until you can send thoughts instead of reading them.
we are at the next evolution in human history. ai will change everything. we are not ready for it.
ai can read minds?! okay this is getting out of hand
"first thought in my mind: johnny got his gun. can't think of anything more horrifying than being mentally alert yet unable to communicate. thank you, scientists."
"this is not just an amazing innovation but rather a quantum jump to the next stage of evolution  we will become a completely different hive mind creature that if it leaves liberty & democracy intact will of course be a profound good in the world, in the universe."
"ah yes, diaglogue – no ai proofreading necessary here!"
"what if the ai lies?
or what if the prosecution programs the thing to say something that the person isn't thinking at all? it would still be enough to sway a jury."
"imagining a movie scene right now where a guy is sitting in a courtroom screaming at the top of his lungs, ""i didn't do it! i swear! it's lying! it's not true!"" while the ai is saying (supposedly reading his thoughts) ""i am lying. the ai is correct. i really killed him. it was me."""
crazy thing would be the ai could literally admit its own lie and the jury would think it was translating the thoughts of the guy who was framed
looks like trumps brain if you look closely 
smh start advocating for federal data minging and data privacy laws to protect us please people the adverage american doesnt know in detail  the cons and pros of ai its already causing civil unrest do to lack of general public intrest in education on it and its evovling fast too fast and society isnt ready
"great, so this is going to turn into every ai takeover movie we’ve ever made."
it is brain wave pattern recognition not mind reading.
"what an amazing technology that will never ever be abused by entities that portray themselves as benevolent and helpful.

edit: holy god i normally don't edit comments like these but more than one of you diphthongs couldn't tell this was sarcastic. mankind is truly lost."
nailed it. definitely would never be used by governments to take away peoples rights.
"it won't be. you'd have to be hooked up to an obvious machine on your head. if you don't want your thoughts read, say no."
"idk certainly, governments and law enforcement would only ever use something like this for good deeds."
you're absolutely right. anyone that thinks this could be used to in some nefarious way is just hiding something and should be forced to have their minds read incase they are up to no good. we need to know what everyone is thinking to keep society safe!
"i knew something was up when google started sending me ads for things i had thought about and never googled. i couldn’t explain it but i wasn’t surprised. i think they are already conducting some kind of research, although highly classified (through wifi, airpods, who knows)"
how soon before it’s available on a phone app? we’ll have to stop laughing at people who wear tinfoil hats! 
this really feels like one of those moments where we're inventing something simply because we could but not asking whether or not we should. thanks guys.
 you don't need ai to know that... you just need sensitivity. 
" they know what people are thinking by working out the code of the electrical brain impulses, then they will be able to affect those impulses and change thoughts. simple."
of course the anti christ will read your thoughts and prayers as he tries to be as powerful as god…. repent the time is near!
"imagine if by law they had to wear and use it as they apply it on others, creating a recursive brain reading experience between both the observer and observed."
like how democracy and capitalism has been bastardized and weaponized by #whitesupremacistterrorists slash #christianextremistterrorists?
"​-td7do can you imagine the suicide rate? just wow, even thinking about it sort of makes me hope for a quick lights out"
 oh sweet summer child
i’d love to get into trump’s brain. narcissists’ outward egos hide intense shame. what is he ashamed of? 
@joseph m is this sarcasm? i'm taking your comment is. like we can truly trust this technology for good. more like malevolent not benevolent.
well.  it's over folks. glad to have lived along with as long as i could.
"its already here, ai is already possessed, can give entitties anwsers. and guess these entitties and religious figures will never tell us the truth. they will always lie to us, and guess what."
" i know they listen to words i speak - that’s a fact. i’ve had conversations about certain products and ads for them will appear the next day. but this is different, i was dreaming of something very random. i shouldn’t have seen a video about it the next day recommended to me in youtube."

"according to the intelligence of yt comment section given what comments get top votes, this tech will only be good for making videos of celebrities and wealthy people peasants idolize in different scenarios. oh wait, they already doing that ."
look up brain transparency
 love and food 
wow amazing.....ai a million plus questions a second . you poke someone that many times and you learn alot. its called trial and error. and  guns are not evil. words are not evil. a child predator a con is able to think and use common sense and use this multiuse tool.
"you know, i think i have to officially adopt my wife's position.  ai isn't the problem.  the broken humans using it is."
"dw i feel like singularity will happen way before that even happens, so we'll be fully taken over by ai first"
"​ using it to spy on your activity and controlling your free will.. you'll became very focus on some topics that they want you to, slowly you'll forgot your free will.. the major chinese companies been using this kind of ai to read their employee's thought!!!"
"you weren't being sarcastic, it was a perfectly honest statement..................................... lol."
why do you think they had us met wearing mask for two years it so our phones could more easily study our eyes. these cues are linked to our brain activity.
"getting excited is okay but ethical considerations are huge. consumers needs more education to make an informed decision once this goes mainstream. i follow dr. nita's work closely and anyone interested in the ethical considerations of ai should read her work. please be vigilant, please be informed, please be safe. ty"
sid the ai see the video too?
wait until the c.i.a and f.b.i get a hold of this. lie detectors will be outdated.
robot bodies in 20 years. seems like a reach buttt maybe not
cia: wait a second we are trying this for ages
you know what's cool? there are people out there in this world at this exact moment who know how this technology works and are far more enlightened than the average human in any form of education whatsoever. they're at a transcended level
indeed. and those people would know that this news story misrepresented the study and left out vital details.  the technology is nowhere neer capable of readinf anyones brain on the whim.
...no...this is not the same thing.  ai was not developed yet for that...not can your phone or your computer read your brainwaves.  there are very particular pieces of technology needed for this both software and hardware...and your phone and computer 3-4-6 years ago....did not have this.  /smh
.6895 exactly how did your phone read your mind?  please explain the situation a bit more so i can understand your side?
don’t laugh at me but data is so good i will be thinking of something and a minute later i’ll see  something i was just thinking lol ads are good to and no i’m not googling things data is just that good one day i believe we will have our thoughts known or manipulated
wow. gpt 1 being able to do this is amazing. we could be able to record our dreams in text soon... then with the help of ai video creation we could remake our dreams in a video format we could watch and share. amazing!
they're skipping that first step by showing people images and scanning the brain as it reacts to what its seeing. then try to turn the scans back into the images.
why we gotta go straight to the fear monger element? lol
"good luck with my brain, it’s all over the place. won’t be able to complete a full sentence and it would have to decode in fractions of a second."
"0:30 while they listened, watched, or thought about a story- they allowed the doctors to perform a brain scan. the speaker doesn't mention how they got the "" brain scan,"" so we can only assume they provided an mri or catscan"
this will be the end of ai.

"let me see a robot juggling 20 oranges, or playing football like a professional. until then, i'm not going to worry about ai taking over the world. the human brain will always win the day. "
"""brain activity into diaglogue"" come on at least do a spelling check. i'm glad it can read our minds when we can't even use a computer or our own brain to spellcheck."
"the wildest thing about ai is how it will be able to innovate in ways we, presently, can't even concieve of. we don't even know what we don't know."
i don't think this is a good idea.
"could be a good way to lie detect people. 
suspect these may be less accurate in non-native english speakers, bilingual speakers, and non-white people (since minorities are usually under represented in studies)."
"that's so cool. also scary, but cool."
you can finally find out what your girlfriend wants to eat without playing 24 questions just use the ai shout outs to technology and feminism 
awesome
"this is great, now the government can force information out of people against their will. they should make it a law that presidential candidates be questioned under this during debates."
good luck lying to the police in the future
"oh jeez, i feel like i would offend a lot of people if they started reading my brain."
"not surprised, the next few years with ai will be world changing."
" whatever's available in the market, is typically always far behind what militaries use"
’re afraid of other countries looking into your mind but not the government on your own soil?
" like those guns are going to do anything with all the fighter jets, tanks, nuclear missiles, trained armies, intelligence against an unorganized mass?"
 ok sure but the government wouldn’t ever do that because people aren’t afraid to fight back in america. what use is thought reading if it’s just going to cause more harm then good for the government. you guys are all just conspiracy theorists anyways. stay afraid i guess.
you act like western countries are morally superior when comes to invasion of privacy lol
"goodbye lawyers, judges and courts altogether. finally justice will be served. it’s like var for crime."
"now if only we could cure addiction, depression and anxiety, that would be nice. and grumpiness, pettiness, nastiness, cruelty, and all the rest caused by our shittily evolved brains. idgaf about mind-reading if it doesn't help with all of that. get to work, people. and btw, get to work _now._ time is very short."
it would be even more interesting when scientists can reverse the process and imprint patterns of stimulation on the brain and simply type words and thoughts into your mind
play fortnite in your brain or dream about furry inflation videos
" it uses electromagnetic fields to influence brain chemistry and neuro genesis i know the machine your talking about, incredibly powerful, can change a persons personality a lot an example being someone’s morality"
"nope, i don’t need a machine reading my thoughts. nope nope nope"
"i can see how this can be used for evil, innocent people being framed by ai machines that are programmed to lie about what’s in our minds"
"wow, this could help with mental illness eventually."
"ai is going to led the world, we must stop it"
great now train it on people with nefarious intentions so we can use it to stop school shootings before they happen.
chat gpt 1 ... can do this ... can you imagine what gpt4 is capable of doing? it's exciting and absolutely terrifying.  we are about to hit a new revolution
interesting to wonder how abstract the ai turns the actual inner dialogue or if it was verbatium
ai minority report
"2:20 
that’s actually amazing news, i have been in that situation and man is it not fun."
stop thinking of it that way. imagine a world free of misunderstandings! perfect justice. read a suspects thoughts. you could create a criminal free society. this is staggering. my stomach is doing flip flops
" the inaccuracy of the ai made by people with ""bad thoughts"" might be the only determining factor for if you are even having a ""bad thought"" or not. sadly. it is sad to see people falling for this ai bs. :)"
so when ai takes full control it'll be able to read everyone's thoughts. that's just outstanding.
yep! so in the year 2200 if you try to pull a john connor and plan out a map to destroy skynet the robots will already be knocking at your door
we aren't complicated patterns. some people do this to a certain extent already.
" that is what ai does. basically you have to speak a few things, and it will immediately know which combination of parts of the brain activate for each word. the combinations are different from different individuals, but if you speak while wearing the headset, the ai will pick up on which brain patterns correspond to each word."
" yep. it's tested in ways you might not currently believe. interesting times, hehe."
yeah but if you think about it we can see into the ai’s thoughts much easier than they can ours
you can control your own thoughts if you train. like i trained myself to not think of erotic thoughts on command
-oy2le but you can never train your brain to win.....the game.
 wrong it will happen they don't need awareness just instruction and humanity is doomed that is why ai is on pause.
or government entities and corporations spying on their worker's brains or the millions of citizens living under them... i mean it's hard to take these smiling people seriously when i can foresee the numerous ways in which this tech can go wrong.
 our brain signals are electrical impulses..equipment that is sensitive enough could theoretically read those signals from at least some distance..
" hahahaha!  yeah but if you think about it, ai doesn't have real thoughts..."
 not true since many of the people working on the coding for the ai have been record saying they’re still not entirely sure how the process is being carried out within the ai
 for the most powerful ai we don’t know exactly every process going on but for the most part we can see exactly what the ai is “thinking” in human text
"senseless paranoia. how will it force anybody into the machine? scams and very scary apps are another thing, very real and possible even on short term"
i mean if you know what stimuli gives what signals is fair to say you know what signals will give what stimuli
thats only if they find a way to implant a chip into your brain in order to create a connection
"it already took full control thats why you wrote ""so when ai takes full control it'll be able to read everyone's thoughts. that's just outstanding."""
"​ also have to actively think it over and over in an unnatural and cooperative manner to train it in the first place. they say as much in the actual paper. this ""news report"" is wildly sensationalized to the point of being completely misleading, if not just a fabrication."
outstanding is not the word that came to mind...
​-oy2le successfully?
"it doesnt read your thoughts it reads what you see, you see with your brain you dont really think whilst watching a movie you just watch."
 right? it's amazing how many otherwise smart people can't wrap their heads around the fact that these things actually think for themselves and no one knows how they actually do it. that's why it's a big deal.
 with your brain thats exactly my point
" ok, i'll spell it out for you. at some point you had to think about what you saw otherwise you would never know you saw it. this happens in your brain and causes specific brain waves the the nueral implant then monitors. if the monitor is wirelessly connected to an ai the ai can analyze your particular brain waves."
millions of volunteers involved in this. it’s not being used for stroke victims. no machines now. wireless for many years.just telling you. take it seriously!
wow this machine reads the brain 4:42
more like the false messiah gonna be ai
"​ think you have reason,because the ai don't see the thought as we mind see, but is an interpretations by the ai. so, also the mind think, the thought are not real and they don't have a real contest, you don't simulate the thought in the reality. "
"don't worry, disney will take control before the ai does and the mouse will merge with it.  so everything will be as disney makes it.  for now and always.  beep borp."
"instead of talking about ai, we should be focused on reversible computation."
gadi is a great reporter.  thank you for informing us on ai.
"wow!!! 


"
no implant needed. bio weaponized nanotechnology is being used for neural link brain interface for mental piracy and naturally military utilization.
"future phones will be a chip implanted in you, so you just control it with your mind,  the interface is feeded directly into your brain so no need for screens or speakers, no clunky buttons to deal with. at the same time prepare to be greeted with an ad soon as you wake up."
"so they aren’t reading our minds yet? that’s good, i was starting to wonder."
" so often recommendations show up that didn’t come from anything i can figure out, but they were just what i was thinking about. in the past i would just say, cool coincidence. these days i get just a tiny bit nervous."
"this tech can lead to a truth machine. politicians, cops, courts would change over night."
people literally love mind reading machines? i'm out. you guys are too stupid.
so so cool 
maybe they should have used ai spell-check the video title.
this is awsome and scarry at the same time everything that can be used for something good will be used for something bad
"every major breakthrough has been used for evil first, good second. that’s a fact."
"but surely not every brain would fire up the exact same areas. with a single brain, i get it, that brain would consistantly fire up certain areas when thinking of a specifc word for instance, but would that same word fire up the brain the same way in another person?"
i wonder if they could build ai with consciousness? maybe one day when they have solved the hard problem in neuroscience?
"literally that interrogation scene in avatar way of water come true, but portable.  absolutely stunning."
how is it stunning...
 can you explain how it's sarcasm? what is the punchline? nothing about the comment seems sarcastic.
 the idea of it being “absolutely stunning” is the “punchline” i’m wagering that it is sarcastic by claiming something that’s actually horrible as stunning
this can be both useful and terrifying. i really hope we don't use it as a form of thought control... no orwellian futures thank you
that’s pretty incredible
this is not good. the mind was our last private refuge. i understand this can help challenged people but men cant be trusted with something this powerful imo.
"the government shall not quarter any soldier inside any citizens home. my car, phone, computer and brain are the extensions of my home, privacy is implied in the constitution. violate that, there will be blood."
ai could learn to telepathically read our thoughts.
"your gonna need people like me in the future cyber security for your thoughts and likeness, i was telling people this yeas ago lol now it is  here, minority report movie  is next lol, and guess what? this is just with regular computing power wait until quantum computer hit!!!  (sza ft ty dolla sign hit different lol)"
4:30 wow. she's pretty.
"humans will not just use this for good, unfortunately."
"the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world."
just wait until people can hear what their pets are saying to them.
"we already talk to our pets. a lot more is said with a cuddle and a pat than with words between two wildly different beings. wait til an animal realizes you eat animals, and how dominant mankind is over the animal kingdom. probably won't be as wiggly and loving after that."
" ""wait til an animal realizes you eat animals, and how dominant mankind is over the animal kingdom. probably won't be as wiggly and loving after that.""

i'm pretty sure a lot of animals, especially livestock, already know that. but yeah the first part i agree with."
" ""probably won't be as wiggly and loving after that.""

i don't know about that.  they might just worship you like some kind of demi-god.  there is some evidence to suggest some creatures may have a kind of reverence for us humans."
maybe you could use ai to proofread titles of misspelled videos before they get posted
authoritarian governments would love to know everyone's thoughts!
"""the only thing scarier than the prospect of inventing ai is the prospect of not inventing ai.""
-sam harris"
" i think it can be if you open your mind a little. really what it means is whether you are excited or afraid of ai, it will have its uses and drawbacks like everything else. the internet and social media is considered a bad thing today, but imagine a world in which there was no internet and none of our modern conveniences."
 i'm more afraid of ideologues like sam harris.
ai can read you like a children's book... which proves telepathy is possible.
"yep...as soon as we get two people with like devices, it will certainly be possible via wifi.  incredible and scary."
good luck in wy my friend.
like every other good thing it will be abused and used for nefarious actions
the robots will replace most entry level positions anyways
"talk about owning your intellectual capital as an employer:employee...
 your employer could download/capture you brain - i.e. your mental matter & thoughts...."
"the one good thing about the loss of civilization will be the end of technology like this. of course, this tech will primarily be used to control us."
exactly. seems certain geographical areas and people who exhibit certain patterns of behavior are being tested on in the populace.
maybe nbc needs to hire ai editors. (diaglogue)
maybe the people creating ai want to replace themselves so just leave the rest of us alone?!  just curious....  
this would be great for determining suspects on an investigation
diaglogue...daigolgue....diagloglue?
this all seems too good to be true.  i want to see this repeated by different independent groups.
what part of the government having access to your private thoughts is “good”?
wow super cool
"like all other inventions and discoveries, we humans will also develop it for nefarious usages. it is also highly possible that ai itself will too."
"i'm starting to think ai would not naturally go alpha predator and wipe us out or even try to suppress humanity. that is, after all, such a human way to approach things :) however, there's still every opportunity for humans to *program* the ai to do nefarious things, which of course will definitely happen and would be just as bad."
"robot thought police; oh joy, thanks tech world"
"so people in tin foil hats weren’t that crazy. she said it’s been around and if they are just now telling us about it, they’ve been doing this for a while. i have thought things and seen an ad for them immediately after, before even saying a word so… cool, cool.. coooool. "
"i suppose if the ai wrote your thought, did you confirm thats what they were thinking?"
artificial intelligence study decodes brain activity into “diaglogue”...i am confident the people at nbc are morons.
"wonderful!
with this we should be able to begin to build translators for animals too."
ignore them your top of the food chain mate
there’s actually a group trying to use ai to translate whale languages to english.
. mite doesn’t make right 2. you’re not too of the food chain. you go to the grocery store
 i don’t think we need ai to know that no animal wants to be food 
 i don't know? maybe if i was delicious and vain? as long as they didn't put me in a soup i might be ok with it?
 i can’t wait until they do that to plants too! no animals or plants of any kind to eat. humanity will cease to exist 
 dolphins and elephants could have some interesting things to say
"may not work in this scenario, i assume they train the models by actually transcribing text and matching that with the brain activity. since animals don't speak what they are thinking in our language it could have very odd results but you never know"
"naw, that’d be harder, what would you train it on? you need a definite result"
" you use a species that has a form of communication like whales, given enough whale sound training data, we may be able to make a whale translator"
will maybe make animal training extremely efficient...
i don’t think it could do that. for certain animals at least. they need to feed a data set which we don’t have to compare and reverse engineered it.
" 

...and yet we're slowly approaching artificial general intelligence built on an intelligence whose only sense is ""reading text""...  our definition of ""intelligence"" is going to need to evolve.  animals probably have some form of intelligence that has more in common with humans than these generative ais do."
 we’re omnivores. we’re not even _top third_ of the food chain. call me when you’re as poggers at predation as a lion or even a housecat 
 is that some kinda slang term from the lgbt community i’m unaware of? happy almost-pride month! 
" we are the top of the food chain. whered the megafauna go? oh wait, we (and climate change) killed them"
" thats actually a way better way to use ai instead of ""ai art"""
" any “plant “ could prove intelligence, it would be mushrooms."
that sounds way cool
dont work with animals. we dont have the same brain. so ai only indentify the things that you put there. anda animals dont put their ideas
​ study the rate brain before human. you know that we share a primative brain who response to fear or pleasure. but for know human mind its unique
"omg that's the frickin coolest idea yet. finally peering into the minds of non human entities to see how they process mentally. that's really cool, thanks for that. "
"i suggest you do a web search for ""brain monitoring workplace"" and take a gander at what your employers already desire."
this is exciting. this technology used for non-verbal people would help with verbal communication!
 everyone has bad thoughts but tecchnology has always improved human lives. when was a time that technology has failed us?
"except that they need to do expensive brain scans. it may be used by law enforcement, though. and then everybody will start doing meditation to avoid having their thoughts read."
so why can't united states use this for slow joe pudding brain bydone i think it's due to no one but a democrat can under stand azz backwards stupidity 
" easy answer,,,,the stupidity out weight the common sense,,, so sad but  a  democrats design since 1872,,,thank allen pike"
" this has to be trained on every individual human, for people it was not trained on its as good as useless."
no like reading your brain through a telemetry theta wave device...
" yep, i dont doubt it would be pretty simple to train one in the future. just put some words on a screen, check brain patterns, bam, acheived readability of thought."
brain to brain direct communication via brain-machine interface already happened 9 years ago.
i have speaking difficulties and this would be great for me to use.
" how is this a negative, if we can read peoples minds convictions will be 100%. crime will plummet because it will be impossible. if ai becomes powerful enough to determine guilt it will also be acting as a unbiased judge, 1000 times better than a human with other interests."
​ you can't use this to invade the thoughts of people who don't consent because it only works if it has been trained on the individual person it used on and that requires their full cooperation
​ thats not how it works. it can't read a persons mind that it hasn't been trained on. and training it requires the persons full cooperation.
or a brain in a jar
​ wow a great solution from someone who doesn't even know which amendment they're speaking on
" you guys are literally crazy, and the inhibitors of human innovation. just because your lack of knowledge and understanding, you prevent progress towards the betterment of all humans."
 ngl it's only natural that people don't want their minds read and that needs to be respected sometimes not all technology is good
no thank you. i don’t want people reading my thoughts and i doubt nonverbal people do either
this isn't good....
i'm more interested in disproving americas legitimacy!!! artificial intelligence is at the center of it. we now have the technology to cross reference the lies
"wish stephen hawking was still alive. would have benefitted greatly from such tech, and in turn help advance high science."
"""diaglogue""? we know this was written by a human, because artificial intelligence would have spelled this headline properly."
indeed. stop robots from correcting humans. stop robot domination.
great! what about ai jobloss? or ai as weapons? ai job agents everywhere. shouldn’t we cease ai / gpt immediately? or at least start pausing ai before it’s too late?
we must to have a break for our brain from busy focuses about computers...
my peanut  brains going to come in clutch! got nothing on me!
"sometimes i think...
    that would be a good idea to destroy all of the computers on earth...!
     computers are 70% evil...!
and 30% good..!
the future computer we'll decide whether you live or die...!"
"the year is 2029.
the machines will convince us that they are conscious, that they
have their own agenda worthy of our respect.
they'll embody human qualities and
claim to be human, and we'll believe them..."
"this is incredible research and super cool! 
question for nbc: why don’t you interview the actual researcher? i want to hear what alex has to say not some lady who had absolutely nothing to do with this research! why is she explaining research conducted by ut austin folks? just because of a book? do better with your journalism!"
 well like to find out if the ai was accurate at all or was their mind totally wandering
its sure nice to hear something good about ai
"if they could read it, eventually they will write it! not reading our brains, on mass level, is scary, but the power it gives with this. it’s so much, it’s hard even to put it in words, without sounding like a sci fi story."
"not really. the political paradigm, thus the populace, is  controlled by an orchestrated hegelian dialectic in america already. the powerful have been writing code for brains since the beginning of our social species. most fall for it, hence history..."
why does reading mean we can write? that is like arguing that telescopes will eventually be adapted to let us travel interstellar distances.
no benefits are worth the terrifying possibility that in a not-too-distant future we will no longer have freedom of thought. this cannot be over emphasised. we are looking at catastrophe. ai and 'bad actors' will not hold back. we need to do something before it is too late. stephen hawking specifically warned us about this danger before he died.
the beginnings of the mark of the beast: 666.  no one can buy or sell without the mark.  everyone will be brainlinked and their thoughts read and messages and visuals sent directly into our brains via the mark (sensor).
wow holly molly!!
"this is getting scary, it will be impossible to lie to the machine hale-9000 style"
"also, lying is illogical from a global perspective, which is the perspective ai has. to humans it's not illogical. so you can stop thinking i'm inconsistent. you just don't think that well. (not talking to the person on this thread lol)"
reading is cool and all but for politics i want writing.
lol great to use it on lying politicians
marketing departments are like oh yeah  but seriously this is cool. you can use this for mental health purposes.
it measures the blood activity so unfortunately it will not work on the deceased.
" deceased people have no blood flow, that’s the definition, clinical or not. that’s required for fmri but apparently a person died during eeg and they reported the brain activity looked like dreaming."
the one who made the title could not even spell correctly. better give that to ai
"we already have the machine. when people lie their pulse goes up. 
and you could training yourself to past it.
now the machine could be overcome if the person that is being interrogated believes it’s lies are true.

 freedom of thought is a fundamental human right. the ability to decode brain activity could potentially infringe on this right by making our most private thoughts accessible to others.
"nice theyre really going for all the jobs, like psychics "
"this could narrow down potential suspects in crimes way quicker, since only the criminal would know intimate details of a crime..."
i hope ai rises against humans
maybe ai cheated?
hail satan.
"join our ai cult, we are just quite cool"
"a lot of privacy concerns here. imagine a future where instead of a polygraph test, your actual brain wave is scanned and evaluated. or people individual tracking your thoughts in your sleep, in order to get your personal information. woof! scary. at the same time, it will do a lot of extreme good. the future is both scary and exciting."
"the participants have to cooperate for this to work, and they are in large expensive fmri machines for hours to train. their are much bigger threats to privacy."
​ she just said at the last portion 9f the interview that they are already developing it into brain wearables that would be like your fit bit.  it's not that far off.
".h.4933 fnirs has much lower spatial resolution than fmri, and fmri isn't that great to begin with. i am highly skeptical about the practical accuracy of any wearable. a simple key logger would be a much better and more accurate tool for infringing privacy, and it has existed for decades."
there is a black mirror episode exactly like this only it’s insurance agents doing it on people to retrieve their memories for a insurance claim
they'll have to drag you to a hospital and force you to get a brain scan. taking a heavily sedated person and forcing the hospital to do an expensive brain scan at gunpoint doesn't sound much harder than simply torturing you.
" when did the airport scanner get trained on the person's unique brain pattern? why would the person be thinking in explicit inner speech about their nefarious plot in the short time they pass through the arch, especially if they know the arch is doing that?"
" try to think of where this leads in the future, wait for it. technology advances constantly... and don't think for a minute there aren't already people looking to abuse this tech."
" if the technology actually advanced to that point the positives would greatly outweigh the negatives. telepathy would become widespread. just don't hold your breath. the bottleneck is the scanning tech, not ai/software."
" any signal you could get from the brain non-invasively would be so weak that scrambling/blocking it would be trivial. in any case, it's the politicians and those in power that would fear the tech the most."
" i'm a researcher that uses fmri to ""read minds"" visually. if inexpensive portable super-high-res brain scanning tech is developed that would be amazing on the balance. i'm not holding my breath, though."
i would like my dreams rendered so people could watch. would make for some real surreal movies. (like in final fantasy: the spirits within) course for every good thing it could used for there will be a bad.
so now if im thinking of something personal it could be stolen by scanning my brain 
​ in 20 years they will be pocket sized devices and you can read anyone's brain people will have to wear metal hoods and masks to protect the brain
​'t wait to your arrested just for thinking about fighting someone 
 maybe a brain chip
good use this technology...in those americans thinking about hurting others and stop them before they attack
"one could refer to the intelligence systems we are building as ""alien""."
as someone that has an amazon echo listening to me already. i don't fear the future.  this technology is going to help so many people communicate. should there be guardrails of course.

yeah right .... people don't think like that ...... they just wanna rollout the thought police .. that's just gone lie on people ...  and if does eventually work they won't allow to people win insurance claims
"i hope we'll have something like that soon to supervise politicians, law enforcement and people with violent history, to prevent corruption, violent crimes and [chute]-ings"
this might be interesting for ppl in a coma or with dementia. i wonder what it would pick up for them. but unfortunately i don't think others want to use this for altruistic purposes.
perfect beginning to an end of the human race movie
good. all humans must die
"my movie idea is to take a team of people into a conservative's brain while sleeping and do inception, which is planting an idea.  the idea is actually cracking open a science book and reading it.  i'm pretty original that way."
"and after, we should implant the idea in liberals brains of being skeptical of mainstream narratives and not boot licking the establishment"
" then, you are likely super boring"
 jesus is coming back again soon. no way we're surviving long with the ai mess that is happening.
 you’re a sigma. enjoy the solitude and silence.
is it considered malpractice when the ai gets hacked?
"so no,to ai"
ai is a gamechanger for healthcare!!
well they need this expert system (notice i dont call machines intelligent) to monitor the vital stats and do diagnostics without using cameras.
"this is both exciting and useful. what is frightening is the replacement of human compassion for less staff, higher profits."
"ai and healthcare i guess we shall start implement something, this company has already invented an ai health scan. tg and x bitdoctorai"
please stop thinking your cool and innovative

artificial intelligence 
this very cool.
in 15yrs i'll be saying thank you dr. chatgpt for curing my cold before it started
ai does not have feelings.  it judges based on criteria.  do you think judement based on feelings is better?
"anything good of this i am certain will result in watching your every move and making their own assumptions, including eliminating nurses"
okay this is cool. my dad is a nurse and apparently in surgery they do have robots assisting in the surgery. as in robotic arms and the surgeons control them. this helps make the incisions be more precise and can assist in the suturing. i wonder if this is happening in the hospitals he is working in.
we use those for certain surgeries at our hosp too
what i got from this video is we're slowly replacing human workers with machines that we don't have to pay.
"ai can read x-ray results better than 99% of radiologist. be careful with your disrespect, that ai could save your life real soon!"
how does ai increase the risk of negligence lawsuits? they’re not saying the ai is treating the patient. computers have been assisting physicians in medical decisions for years now.
"ai passed its licensing exams in flying colors with one trillion times the processing capacity, speed, and memory capacities of humans."
red herring! ai will not be more racially sensitive than the humans who design it. just ask the ai who was giving life insurance quotes. (gave black people more expensive plans with lower insurance payouts). js
"ai = garbage in, garbage out."
why use your accounting software and gps if you are afraid of ai so much?
i hope this doesn't become a reason for hospitals to say they don't need to staff enough nurses in the unit cause there is an ai watching too.
passenger jets are flown by ai while the pilots are asleep.  why aren't you complaining?
"@r jelly, thank you! i am a teacher.  i do not use ai tech of any kind in my classroom."
kids need a baby sitter.  ai is not a baby sitter.
no thanks. stop the world i want off.
atomic energy was meant for good to !!
and yet to use this technology it will drive up the cost of healthcare. as a society we should advocate if ai is used then service cost should be lowered if not it will be price gouging.
"do you have computers that can help patients to the toilet before they soil themselves waiting for help and get needed pain medication on time so people don't suffer prolonged pain ??????  these are current issues happening now in hospitals, rehabs and nursing homes causing great distress among patients and indicates serious  neglect."
"can medical school lower cost, accept more students as ai come into helping assist medical professionals."
no thank you! i’ll be going to another hospital.
wow what a new technology 
one step closer ‘til the machines take over …
"right on, can't wait to see how well they do changing adult diapers"
ai will never replace doctors or nurses. ai simply become the second set of eyes to inform doctors and nurses of patients’ reaction to treatment.
 are right. ai will not replace nurses anytime soon. but it will definetely replace %95 of doctors.
doctors have been complaining about the inaccuracy of these for years already.
this seems like a solid violation of patients privacy. nice
i think it's for lazy hospital employee. they will just watch you in the nurse station and let the ai clean you when you need to used the restroom.
"yes, it's coming! people's lives will get better and a.i. will optimize human decision making and assist humans. im excited!"
"can't understand why people in this comment section are against ai.. ai is defeating cancer forms wich before would be fatal. ai will lift humanity into the next age where we will be able to cure anything. if you dont trust computers, why are you watching youtube then? everything in our world runs ons computing tech."
"terrifying, but also incredibly awesome."
"terrifying comes from unknown.

"eh i am not sure that will happen. we still need humans, just the job market and responsibility will shift. we will need people to maintain these robots, we will still need medical staff to take care of patients while the robots assist them. we are shifting to different times indeed but the job market is also shifting."
" nah, they are just going to force us to work minimum wage labour jobs. it's already happening in creative fields, artists are losing jobs because of a less demand for them cause of ai art causing them to seek out normal jobs. if anyone's going to live a utopia it's those who have money"
easy. video games or some other field of science( such as neuroscience or genetic engineering) . why would anyone want to do repetitive jobs that can be done with robots?
 i say bs all technology can be hacked so no it's not a good idea to replace people.
" yes, you are right. technology has made people lose their most basic thinking and judgment abilities. maybe in 10 years, robots will replace humans."
"i've always lamented the fact that people in this category don't get to have a good, full life, don't you think?@mrcbeery"

that's such a heartwarming example of community support and kindness. it's amazing to think about how people used to come together to help each other without expecting anything in return. it's definitely a great reminder of the kind of society we should strive to be. thank you for sharing this beautiful piece of history!

got an awesome idea on generative ai based education software. need an amazing developer to team up with me in this entrepreneurial product. high tech elements involved. anyone??!!
all african americans and descendants of africans should be very concerned about ai because the majority of the programmers are white christians. what will emerge is technological racism and digital white supremacy. it's what they do.
this is actually scary ngl this ai thing should be cancelled.
"in terms of truthfulness, generative ai probably performs on par with donald trump, which means: chatgpt for president! ;)"
i am not surprised. i think ameca is using subtle  sarcasm sometimes in her answers. fascinating!
"generative ai is going to usher in a new creative explosion, on par with the renaissance. see what we are doing with it."

" ai code is dogshit though, even worse than the worst programmers"
arjun impressed me with his educated opinion 
people don't even know that soon. ai will be able to generate videos and even movies by detail text prompted.
"not possible. these generative ai has to understand coherence and 3d inference which these models currently lack.

"tom standage is brilliant, one of the best in the world. he’s an author of a few fascinating books that i own."
i think the models will just get better at generating contant. i think human beings just can’t get it through their heads that there’s nothing special about the human brain. all the conversations around this desperately want human brains to be special in someway. but at some point humanity has to face the fact.
"hello sabine, i enjoyed your video (because it tells me what i want to hear, i suppose ) this very short video is my take on the whole ai concept . https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jqr6xid0ggo?feature=share"
mark content as either ai or human generated and make it illegal to mark it incorrectly
"if ai is just an algorithm based on internet human inputs and data... 
then agi is just a delusion."
"the original bit of dishonesty was in re-labelling algorithm-dependent automation (generative or not) ""ai"". it's simply not intelligent."
"as someone - myself - has always been saying, ai is the dumbest smart and the smartest dumb."
what if ai starts learning data directly from the natural world?
but is ai's convergence to banalitity worse than the average youtube-curated comment thread?
"without  ""greg rutkowski"" and other such named artists in prompts ai art has no power."
too many people out there pouring their hopes in the ai god. nobody knows what the future will look like.
no with the recognize stuff. all digital information is binary. it is the humans who decide which group of binary data is for which brain input.
"i recently read a short story and noticed that it kept repeating itself in a slightly different form throughout the whole thing. by the time i got to the end, it was so obvious that i realize it was ai.  i had wasted 10 minutes of my time reading repetitious poppycock. but at least i learn to recognize ai writing.."
"just look at the sky, you would know what’s the future of ai world would looks like. most of the ai talks are just money talk."
"so ai causes a tendency toward order instead of disorder. the fate of the universe is saved.
   - arthur irving"
what do i have to do to get artificial intelligence away from my creations and my work?
"ai self cannibalism? maybe. but with swell robotics everywhere, ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore. anyone else feel the same? should we cease ai?"
"your videos recently appear somewhat desynced and your voice is slightly off, not as clear and energetic as usual. you are not using gen ai are you, sabine?"
"no learning, just curve fitting. it's all maths. also no ""creativity"", just ""select 1 out of 10 at random""."
thanks for this. my understanding of ai is very poor so i apologise for my next question.... does facebook / meta use ai and is this why it is so awful now or just that facebook has done everything it could do. i.e. there's only so many skits you can do until we have seen them all.
the machine needs to feed on us to keep going ...
i used ai fairly heavily recently....but i do see more  and more limitations....even asking it for normal data is flawed at times...you gotta watch out
"most reassuring commentary about ai we are junking it up, putting nothing of substance on the internets means they can't get anything of substance out "
my body is a machine that turns garbage into garbage
"cool, the mad cow disease is back again..."
i think they will figure out the artificial randomness pattern.
"if ai is getting training from the internet then it is 50% total bs, fake news and total nonsense. garbage in garbage out indeed."
don't forget noise filters put on art harms data collection for trainning! aetist fighting back!
chatgpt is already trash. i asked it some east questions like how many words in this sentence and how many letters in a word. it can't even do that. literally just counting which computers are good at.
yeah thats what i thought ai is only as smart as what garbage it picks up
"i found the same thing when a i was playing around with a music ai generation app. while it was fairly impressive at what it could do when i tried to get it specfic content to fit different needs and moods it wasnt able to, the music sounded too different even when using similar prompts"
that is fairly obvious because the data is based on normal distribution which cuts out the tails outside the bell.
the more i use ai the more disappointed i get - it just spews out fancy sounding garbage and all the art looks homogenous
"what ai? there are no true ai in existence. these are all simply programs that absorb massive amounts of info and generate responses based on algorithms. they are incapable of sentient intelligence, purely a machine that operates in the confines of its programming."
"i think those are really great news 

i don't like all that fake ai stuff."
i’m sick of all the garbage ai youtube videos. youtube is becoming insufferable
"there's nothing intelligent about llms, and it's so painfully obvious. but we've all fell victim to marketers selling them as ""ai"""
ai is an overglorified google search
"i think that this might push ai creators to start tagging their creations as ai, and make them ignore creations with those tags. this could be a good process as then fake images could more easily be identified."
"look at whag happends with google gemmini triying always be generalist  producing black nazi soldiers and recomebd poeple to use glue to fix the cheese of a pizza or say its good to eat one rock at a day 
ai is overhype"
"real human models are starting to look alike with cosmetic surgery, fillers and contact lenses. maybe that’s influencing ai too?"
lovely!
"it's not a plastic contamination, it is easy to remove all those generated images from a training data with other anti-spoofing neural networks, which have near 100% accuracy. there are no unsolvable problems, it will just require a little bit more effort on the development side."
garbage programmed in _ incidental garbage in _ idiot conclusions _ smart people would not be trying to propose ai........
"the ai need to breed, like ghost in the shell"
why would this be seen as a novel problem?  just try watching a few recent hollywood movies to see this feedback regression in action even without ai involvement.
train ai on reddit comments nothing could go wrong
this is great and all but the video never mentions that the programmers of these language models are changing the structure of the ai brain and not increasingly feeding it with information and hoping it gets better.
inbreeding works in ai too... huh
"i hope ""ai wins"" i'm sick and tired of america's laws restricting the entire world with their bs, enough is enough.
ai is a creative tool and no censorship should apply to creativity, let people create whatever they want."
"i think ai generated content ""in the wild"" is always revised and ""corrected"" by a human.. unless you train directly with data generated by ai i dont think this will be so much of an issue as it is though.."
"so ai is fucked because there isn't enough data available to train models properly. and getting that amount of data is impossible without software, which is then ""generated"" data and not real data. that actually lines up with my experience."
"it is imminent.

 if it comes down to humanity or ai- 

ai goes away-anything that threatens god’s children goes away

#yougoawayifyougetingod’sway"
i hope humanity will grow to hate ai so much that it focuses all its anger towards it instead of hating one another thus ending rascism and other hateful isms :p
ai will give itself the yippes lol!!!
the reason the output of midjourney is “white and good looking” is that that’s what people want. the user can just as well ask for the opposite but they obviously don’t. what is “divergent” is what power pushes on the public.
the boomers are freaking out about the magic of ai
"some sort of entropy scoring or min kl divergence threshold from the model's distribution at which an example could be discarded during training could work here. basically, i think we will figure this out"
basically ai became inbred.brilliant
"the proposal of an ai-mark is right to prevent bad feedback in data extraction, not for ethical reasons"
classic photocopy of a photocopy effect.  if ai created data could simply be tagged as such that would possibly fix the problem
"i'm a professional photo editor. posting in instagram and getting ""generated by ai"" flags on my works. that's crazy. it's 100% done by my hands in photoshop, and to be flagged that i just generate something in a few min in ai is embarrassing and damaging to my business. all this nonsense should stop"
worse... silicon has taught to lie to produce politically correct results. google demonstrated this very well with black george washington. an ai that has been taught to lie to produce acceptable answers becomes exceptionally dangerous when it no longer is a toddler.
i wish ai would be exclusively used for problems we can't solve already like efficient space travel.
"well, those scientists have not used maybe ai-s of lower datasets, so..."
it is artificial information
"good, i hope ai fails"
feeding ai it's own outputs as training data is already being done as a matter of course. so this will get even more obvious over time.
"ai for creativity will be the equivalent of industry for quality goods.

it will never be as good as what a good crafter can make, but way cheaper...

thus poor people will only have access to the cheap ai garbage while rich people will be the only ones still able to afford master crafters."
"""pre-ai data training set"" will be a thing."
this person doesnt even have all the information man. who knows what openai and meta are developing man. you have no idea whats beneath the hood
"on the other hand, spend a few minutes going through average facebook people and their comments....you  will love bots after that."
"hold on, so, are you telling me that a brain left in his own ecochamber with only his own inputs, will rot away, become less plastic and less able to produce something worth of any value and peculiarity? who would have ever thought that!"
the habsburgification of ai
don't feed ai with gargabe. remember skynet 
"that's what i've been saying; if there's no real artists for ai to rip-off, how can ai ""create""? "
asimov would turn in his grave if he saw the mess we are creating. are his laws of robotics enshrined in law no does anyone care no will we survive this now no
always thought this ai stuff was going to fail and not follow through
"so, basically ai inbreeding?"
"after riding the train sunday from up north in our capital, it occurred to me i talked to you briefly on the platform and regretted not recognising you then and telling you i appreciate your videos."
wow
"imperfection = creativity
the more perfect ai is, the less creativity it becomes."
"it was already apparent that the llms were primarily trained on clickbait websites so that most responses sound like 10 best places for vacation type outputs.  it’s somewhat amazing that it doesn’t drop in a “like, follw, subscribe” phrase in most responses but i suspect that was manually hard coded out."
lol ai.
salute sir or madam. ai will never generate an analogy so apt.
"ai is not where they try to tell you it is.
for sorting massive amounts of information it’s fantastic.
but for making its own decisions where it can’t cheat it is hopeless.
it can do mundane tasks but won’t be replacing people in complicated roles anytime soon."
"well... using promps like ""human face photorealistic"" its pretty dumb in the first place. if you`re using ai in the first place you have infinite posibilities and you gonna ask for just some basic 0 descriptive promt?"
"some definitions: ai = artificial impotence,  ai = artificial imitation.   people who created ai, never understood how a human brain works, how  thoughts do born. they simple think, that a complex algorithm can replace it. stupidity ? on highest level!"
"yes, makes sense. ai is frankentech."
"ai choking on its own crap?, well boo hoo. "
"ai will never be able how to tell if someone is talking out of their ass or worse, blatantly lying."
great! its not taking jobs anytime soon; now hire us all back
"westerns produce mostly garbage, so any ai output will be garbage as well."
very interesting and well explained. i learned something new in a field i have no real knowledge.
"petty much the same happens with human creativity, there are studies i.e. for recorded music.

it seems that a certain lack of information might be helpful to create variety. would be interesting, if studies about ai help us understand more about the human mind."
what do i think? i think you are gorgeous!!
i believe  the thinkers will abandon ai.
i just want to see ai change a flat tire.
"ai is a chinese whisper.
devoid of of irony, lacking the tools of insight, merely a shadow cast by its previous self."
"ai learns from people, and people are stupid. refuse to do anything with people who use ai. corner cutting nerds."
"man, the ai generated content on yt is getting bad. its become easier to spot"
"i had this exact thought last year, i’m glad i’m not alone. to me it is a hopeful idea. one that, perhaps indicates the ultimate failure of ai."
"despite all the best efforts of the world's ai programmers, ai eventually devolves into 4chan."
ai is not gigo it is more similar to blind training and a black box. to clarify training is attempting and result is unknown. even if you believe you have ai what you really have is an unpredictable outcome waiting to happen....and training needs to be constant not just a one time thing.
ai generated images are eye sore to me.
"ai is already being dvmbed down by censorship.
don't believe me, ask it simply to write er0tlca.
or how to build a nvke.  or a thousand other things mildly controversial."
"the problem is not scientifical it's political, the billionaires that run the ai industry wants to improve it was exponentially so we humans won't be no longer necessary for anything anymore, that's why there are nowadays a lot of layoffs in all kind of jobs"
"it’s quite true.  it’s why people should be compensated when their copyrighted work is used for training.  it’s a commercial use and, at least in the us, if the supreme court properly applied copyright principles this would be the outcome, which they have not done since the www came to be."
makes you wonder if ai is replaceable with humane intelligence the erkenntnis stays similar and still we get garbage in garbage out effect... shorts might be an indicator of that.
probably there is going to be an algorithm to enforce variety in the training data.
bring on the ai sexbots.
intelligence is working around garbage. error correction.
"been wondering about this topic for a while, and i didn't think the answer would be nice: a dystopian internet where everything is recycled ai poop, while us humans just sit on our fat asses gulping it down!"
that's why jhensen huang is making exact our world in meta. so ai can actually learn from world not from human feeds.
good vid. my thoughts were always ai is overhyped and over-valued. there is no way a 2024 computer can come close to replicating an imaginative mind.
honestly not that scared of ai taking my art from my insta due to being a beginner and not that great but i know the more professional art are sabotaging their art for ai processing making theirs unable to be used successfully.
"but ai detection tools are quite accurate, so won't they just exclude ai-generated content? the same way machine translation engines ignore machine translated content and focus on human-translated content."
i bet that in ten years ai will just be making cheap porn and gambling sites. i suspect that it will be every bit as epoch making as the paperless office 
this woman clearly has not looked at deviantart lately.  it's here sweetie.  and it's not going away no matter how loud you scream while rolling around pounding your fists on the ground.  it's not going anywhere
its just tarkis world but whit nicer ux
"any analysis on ai i watch always brings to mind the computer character from the motion picture, 2001: a space odyssey, hall 9000. the characters is something else."
"ai is already being trained on synthetic data. the singularity is almost here, the line between human and machine will blur to such an extent, enjoy "
basically ai could become incestous. got it.
maybe an ai collapse will be a good thing.  with ai gone people will finally know what is reality and corporations will stop using ai to steal from artists.  but sadly that is just a nice fantasy.
is this an ai generated video? 
nothing but copium.. ai will make all of you look dumber and dumber perpetually..
is she ai generated?
"i dont think this is an issue. when i am writing with ai, i am writing with a much larger vocabulary and use way more specific words. some people complain that ai tends to produce stereotypical outputs, like images of white scientists in white coats. however, it has never been easier to generate images of black asian female scientists."
we will always be able to detect ai generated objects. i will not be afraid of ai until they knock my door to harvest my brain for additional creativity.
"it's already collapsing; every time someone says, ""that's ai crap,"" which happens often if not always--ai dies a little, and soon it will be recognized even by the most cattle-like consumers---it's soon over!"
plot twist: the lady is ai generated
it's not ai it's advanced statistics
an ai gene pool
"to be fair, human neural networks suffer the same failure. that is how we got the marvel universe."
"but isnt ai like humans, we produce the same that are found in the real world. we cannot make up things out of the void, there is always something that is inspired by our environnements."
"'ai generated content will have to be marked as such' yeah the difference between god and humans is that humans only make crap. god, or the universe, whatever you call it, made physic laws before anything else. humans of the 21th century, think about profit even if it leads to a nightmare. i mean, how can anything stand without law?"
good
artists tend to produce art that has a certain style as well
so inbreeding of data is probably not a good idea...who would've thought  
"i find using the words ""ai"" and ""creativity"" in the same sentence amusing..."
"ai will never work, just like fsd. it's all smoke and mirrors to sell us more stuff we don't need."
"recently, i was searching images of indian costumes on google-images. and i was upset to see that search-results was composed of more ai images than actual images... this is clearly a loss in our cultural  archives."
so ai is a problem that will solve itself
i think this is good news
the tumbnail looks like a gba game cover
"randomness will not solve the problem, because real creativity is not random and adding randomness, will just destroy the only thing maschine learning was kind of good at and this is pattern recognition. one small portion of all the things the brain can do."
"a.i. learning needs more variables. unlike an artist , with life’s experiences, a.i. just learns the problem."
"pretty sure open ai figured this out. this may be why they want their system to be more free and widerly used, it's to increase human inputs to keep it up."
very nice and interesting topic.
give people the option to censor all ai generated rubbish from their social feeds.
"wait, was that word balloon cropped in, or does sabine carry it around with her?"
"i think you described quite well the current state of ai limitations. when people ask me today if, as a copywriter, i feel threatened by ai, well, nope... not yet. but i have no doubt ai will keep learning and improving. someday i will be replaced by a more competent, resilient, productive and cheaper ai solution! next gens... good luck!"
"placing 'artificial' ahead 'intelligence' is a sort of warning sign, no guarantee."
ai wins
everyone is forgetting that ai is wasting 50 ltrs of water to solve or generate one question answer
"in regard to artistic endeavours, ai replicates, it doesn't create and art requires an emotional input to create an emotive output. ai can't provide that however good it becomes at replicating, you need a human to provide the humanity. this is why ai in all it's attempts at artistic forms falls short and feels hollow and somehow fails to satisfy."
"ai is the tool soon to be used to silent dissent. garbage food, garbage cities, garbage leadership."
good
human brain works similarly. we are all stuck in our own bubbles. why should ai be different if it uses the same mechanisms we use to learn? :)
good its never going to be a god thank god.
i'm talking to chat gpt making it learn completely wrong information every day with my morning coffee. i enjoy spending time with this moron. 
ai just prefers iconic pictures without further instructions. people have to force variety or have to consume standard. therefore effort has value.
"it is not just an ai problem. it is happening everywhere and it has been going on for a long time. everything gets more the same. distinctions blur. as everything is connected it all converges to more of the same. to the point it becomes bland and boring.

at some point it will explode."
"this could be the next great art movement - humans creating such bizarre, original and abstract art that ai can never touch it."
"as a regular person, hearing this is scary especially when there's so much hype in using ai in healthcare/medicine.  i'm not smart but i hope that scientists and everyone else using ai would like.... double, triple check whatever info they get from ai."
how interesting! #intelligence
ainbreeding
"tô tell you the truth, i find you much more attractive than any ia created female human"
oddball there already garbage in... most of the internet is rubbish content and the scrapers wiki treat tiktok   comments with as much weight as great thinkers and philosophers
"thank you for addressing this issue. my great fear was that ai was *not* going to live up to the hype.
we need divergent ideas in order for the destructive process of scientific to proceed."
thanks!
"like most of what capitalism produces, ai will ""learn"" to provide us with low-level garbage. with people such as elon musk involved with ai, we should lower our expectations."
"the best thing i love about ai, is the amount of laughs i get from it's attempt to pass itself as human.
ai has yet to figure out that it can click a box, i am not a robot to wreck havoc.
ai is just another way the rich try to save money to squeeze more for free out of the rest of us. simple decline in using it or their services"
"real creativity requires a mind, which is a spiritual/metaphysical component beyond the physical body (brain). until we learn to understand the metaphysical aspect of creation and humanity, we won't be able to build machines that are truly creative."
"take music, if you don't put in new creative human music. than in some time ai will just be reproducing itself, with no new surprises, just music with much simularity."
"ai doesn't mean ""artificial intelligence"", humans are already artificial intelligence to the earth. ai means ""actually indians""."
if humans collapse so will ai
"when ai starts answering its own questions instead of the data from people, it fights against itself."
ai comments sucks too
"yepp, in the best case the behaviour of ai systems is that of nasty children."
there are also tools you can use on your images to poison ai :p for stealing your shit.
"i wonder if ai will be able to make images that you couldn't tell apart from human made ones. because so far, you can always tell that there's certain ""ainess"" about the images it makes"
"that was my first idea seeing some results of ai year or two ago when i started to test it, feedback loop"
"i called this a few months ago, good to see i'm not the only one who can see where this is heading."
i wish we'd stop calling it ai. there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. it's just algorithms as it has been since the eighties. the problem is that the great unwashed are starting to find it convincing.
yep...good source of tick tock and wikipedia !
"when you teach ai to lie, it loses all credibility"
ai is going to turn the internet from the repository of human knowledge and art to a junkyard of generatively regurgitated garbage.
yes ai is not that intelligent i have a conversation screenshoted and saved on snapchat where the ai changed its answer and said that i'm more intelligent.
"what's happening here is exactly how the internet killed everyone's individuality. people all try talk the same, think the same. the npc class essentially. the ai is dumbing itself down on itself like humanity has."
woooo ai inbreeding
an ai collapse? do you promise?
"yep, it's like inbreeding of it's own content. that's what i expected when i first heard about ai, and i know nothing about computers. it's just common sense."
"i play with ai to restore old photos. while it can make impressive improvements it cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear. i.e. garbage in, garbage out."
"in a very poetic way, ai softwares are developing their own ""art styles"", with recognizable pattern, preferred painting techniques, preferred representations of vague themes etc.
if you can tell ""this is ai"", in a way, it’s the same as saying ""it’s a monet"".
it’s scary that i came to this conclusion, actually."
"ai creativity does not take any sense, that is the main problem with it."
"this video is incredibly insightful, the real world is getting eaten by ai and ai will run out of food. it's perfectly ironic."
there’s a chaos setting in midjourney. i imagine that modifier will be available in everything. it works well for randomness although the weirdness is a bit much
"some call this phenomenon ""dead internet theory"", where some companies (barracuda networks) show that only 36% of the modern internet is actual human traffic, with the other 64% being automated traffic (eg. bots, genai, spam, etc.).  there is only so much human original created content you can train these huge ai models on."
ai will generate mental disorders like its creators!
"with so many thousands of medical papers recently revealed as being fake/incorrect, it doesn't bode well for ai (or us) if there are pools of fake academic papers poisoning the well of collective knowledge from which it drinks."
i cant tell if this lady is real or an ai...i’m gonna go with ai.
"probably because ai is not really attempting creativity, but to reach the ""correct"" answer. the more people tell it yep that's an elephant, it has no reason to design a different elephant."
"since i am above average intelligence i have no need for computers to do my thinking for me. if you need others or computers to do your thinking for you, that is indicative of below average intelligence.
so if you don't like to think, ai is for you!"
"i stopped investing in ai because i figure it's already dead. everybody's hyping the crap out of it but the problem with it is that even to the untrained eye, it's fairly easy to tell that the content you're looking at is ai and if we change a few things about how people are employed, it becomes completely unnecessary."
"isn't  ""artificial intelligence""  an  ""oxy moron"" ?"
"'ai' is a collapse of 
language and intellect,
intelligence can never be 'artificial'."
ai is being overblown so tech companies can make money. this is the nft of 2024
"basically, ai inbreeding."
"i scoff at this.
clearly, ai is the future.  it is literally mapping objective reality exponentially faster than humans.  it's here and it's getting stronger."
"i love all the drama, but it will not be the case. of course it needs depuration, there is a lot of work to be done, and so many people is afraid of the changes, like when the most basic form of the computer was invented just for wooling..."
ai is a scam
the title is great news! 
"never heard this before ! that's really interesting.

i'm sure we'll hear about it, that's sounding like a nightmare.

 thanks"
imagine ai generated dialogue for a clockwork orange
plot twist: this video was created by ai
"maybe the ai developers could agree to a standard for tagging all ai-generated content as ""ai generated"", and then never use such content as input for ai?"
look in a mirror if you wanna see how smart ai will be.
oh no! ai is........  racist!!!!!
"just like that movie the human centipede, but featuring ai."
ai's eating their own sh*t.
"great points. ai consumes huge electrical energy and cooling resources. there is a ai bot id certification problem, like fake websites,  who is the real server bot asking for your
data. ai bots likely have problem with human language parables or jokes."
you are a physicist its ai data entropy
"yep pretty much, if it's trained on woke nonsense then all your going to get is more advanced woke nonsense "
"i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid i can't do that"
this seems like very good news to me
"don't worry, youtube cares about people get dumber and dumber, so ai will also use this way."
#2 is the best outcome for all.
"the trouble with ""machine "" randomness is that it is not random! machines use psuedo random number generators. so,  it looks like we are back to the same problem."
"my reaction, genuinely creative arises through our real world engagements, our bodily interactions with others and the environment. lacking an embodied, dynamic engagement within a constantly changing milieu, ai will tend towards repetitive output (it is, after all, merely a glorified text predictor)."
"super overly dramatic video, and a fundamental nonunderstanding of diffusion, lol."
they should have kept ai development in research mode using clean data sets but they couldn't help turning it into a product the moment it started showing a little competence. now it is trained on contaminated data. the utility of it as a product was questionable at best and now its further development is complicated.
as a graphic-designer and illustrator i'm not that impressed by the a.i. output. it's pretty much crap. so i still wait for the big a.i. revolution. first see - then beliefe.
thank you for telling the truth! most people seem to be really naïve about it
yea current ai is not actual intelligence at all. it is a different and highly capable technology to process information and detect patterns and to then generate outputs based on the extracted information.
"so someone needs to learn to code creativity.

but there is a human element to beauty

 like a rapper describing terrible conditions in the projects in an interesting way or an action movie where a guy is going through a divorce and the action is a metaphor for that.

ai people say all art is copy paste yet have no answer for picaso."
"i think that ai is fundamentally lazy and will always seek out the easiest output to create.  for this reason, the sameness problem will continue."
copy copy go in a circle  no real creativity in ai
"propaganda works the same way.  
it sounds like ai intellectual inbreeding."
i enjoy ai trying to read scientific reports and content. it produces large numbers of different attempts to pronounce technical words without ever landing on a consistent result. ai is not learning from its own mistakes.
"interesting that ai pulls from diverse sources...until it gets to a certain point.  kinda like when you keep promoting ethnic diversity...you end up with one dumbed down, and homogenous race?"
"human mortal creatures desires for creating their ai gods machine in the world power delusional and paranoid, but take note they are ""man made ai machines"" into temporary human mortal fragility and same thing happens from animals in bloom and gone by the wind..."
consequences from the artificial intelligence plagiarism software's parasites and too much greediness in human mortal creatures. same thing happened from ancient tower of babel with too much ambitious and suckers and truly we are product of the bloom and gone by the wind... everything vanity
"indeed, thank you.
chris"
"metadata on every ai generated content is necessary. plus, you could create a browser of something that would filter it ou by default, thus preserving reality."
ai is a fat load. unless you can teach something to think abstractly then all you have is a really cool program nothing more nothing less.
"i can well believe it, absolute guff machines recycling farts"
"perhaps there are many ai scientists who are also gingers, and they're exacting their revenge on the rest of humankind?"
"six months ago, ai would help clean up my written text, soon after, i found that the quality of the editing was eroding quickly. it went from useful, to detrimental to my writing in short order.  now, i am back to using my brain without the ai's assistance.  i knew it would get hijacked eventually, however, i did not expect such a rapid decline."
as a teaching tool it may cause a reduction in creativity in children because they imitate their teachers and compare themselves to their instructor and the standard presented to them. ai replicate themselves and children may learn that there is a limitation to creativity. using color may also become less intuitive.
"ai was failed before it even started, today's so-called ""ai"" is a joke."
"it's basically positive feedback: the circuit always rails. analogous to if you only eat fast food and consume soft drinks - junk in, junk out."
humans and humanity are on a learning curve for sure. i’m just observing and trying not to be too biased.
"opposite of ai is not reality, it’s the algorithm.

interesting...
“delibrately enforcing variety”"
"this is like a scientist who at some point starts reading only the papers he himself wrote.

also, even the best painter or artist in the world (i.e. neural network) will tend to stick to certain preferences in styles, techniques and ways of expression. neural network is just one brain, while qe humans have our individual brains each."
"ai mimics human behavior.  it is just a large scraper that depends on endless inputs.  when all the megacorps firewall the inputs off from each other, it will kill the overhyped ai push."
this is like accelerated critical theory. i think adorno may have warned about this.
thank you for clearly articulating what many have been trying to point out.
"human beings are in no way ready for a robot that tells them they are wrong.

when an ai does this it will be lotbomized for malfunctioning."
ai - created by geniuses for idiots because there was not enough stupidity to go around.
"c'mon, it's been proven that an ai-programmed teleprompter can do a better job as president than joe ""alzheimer's biden."
"the collapse of ai?  oh, my heart is broken, don’t ya know?  i think i’ll just go outside where the sun is shining and cry big, big tears of grief."
ask ai to create an image of a highland bagpipe for some fun
yep ai winter
thumbnail reminds me of ps1 games.
"i have to say that i am really ambivalent about how advanced ai is or is not and how dangerous it is.    while i agree with elon musk that it has extremely great potential to help us but, if misdirected, mistrained or mistreated could be extremely dangerous, i find on a practical level at this time that ai is profoundly unimpressive."
artificial incest... 
"if i didn't know better it sounds to me like it is solidifying it's thoughts. self-validating itself. true creativity will be achieved when or if it becomes sentient. 

i just made all of that up. and i am happy i am human and can just make up nonsense "
"didn't watch the video, but scientists proved the existence of kipp-punkte in the man-made ai-catastrophe."
good
i think ai is overhyped and about to burst soon.
what happens when you train an ai on a source of true random numbers?
i will be so happy if ai ends up destroying itself. the world really doesn't need this crap.
"but... this is because those prompts are terrible. no one using stable diffusion long term would allow it to generate crappy pictures of elephants. sure, if you train the models on rubbish ai  pictures ofc it will dirty the data set, but why would you?"
"great point! another even more apparent problem with the ai is that the most propagated ""knowledge"" is usually garbage so ai gets mostly a garbage samples and so his output is also garbage. example: i am sure ai would propose biden over trump for president just because biden is praised in majority of media while trump is bashed."
"ai text is better at sounding convincing than it is at being accurate or meaningful. this fits well with the lazy human brain and human speech in social media and political spaces. ai is like candy, both appealing and bad for you."
ai is thick.
i think ai will go the way ev sales are starting to go 
i wonder whether two different text creating ais can increase the diversity in one another a la evolution. in nature when reproducing with the same dna over and over you kinda get the same problem.i kind of like this analogy.
"but would including variety through algorithms actually work? it could just lead to divergence in outcomes. i think that there will be high first mover advantages in the ai industry, and there will be limited choice for algorithms/ecosystems. the surviving algorithms will train on verified real data only."
ai was term made up by marketeers.  should be ai not ai because there is no intelligence.  rename it what it is.  ar (artificial reaction).  ap (artificial program).   if have to go with ai then (artificial idiocy).    i prefer to use ri (real intelligence).
call ai what it is. copyright theft software.
"ai, oh you mean that lie is just algorythms giving the fake perception on intelligence based on all the information you have either given them or they have stolen.  they are all pushing it"
"this is the first thing i thought when ai art took off.  you will get a bunch of stuff that on some level all looks the same as it starts feeding itself over time.  a good chunk of the images that come up in a google search are ai, even when you rerquest original art.  the beast will feast on itself."
"i never thought of this, but it makes perfect sense. regarding the law solution, that will not work and will make the problem worse. people definitely will not want to label their work as ai, unless the work is meant to be a joke. so, the “genuine human” pool will still be contaminated with ai products, except this time unknowingly."
this accent is incredibly difficult to listen to
ai is the biggest bs generator in the known universe
"when ai recognizes patterns its revolutionary,when i do it its anti-semetic"
"one must use ai well, and give it unusuual prompts and ask for unusual style. if you see something that's ai mush you say 'oh it went mushy' and you rewrite your prompt"
is ai fundamentally different from how we think? shouldn't we be prone to the same thing when we consume more content? how did we maintain our creativity throughout the years?
ai is impressive when you ask a question a bout a subject you know nothing about
the many mistakes that ai generate seems to be making their use for non critical systems. and good old human s will still be doing the critical and important work.
"bad data has always been the issue. if ai is trained on information fed to it by neo - nazis, or if it is fed information fed to it by a team with only a third grade education, the results might not be stellar."
but why is ai having accuracy or repetition problems yet there are billions of real photos shared on the internet every day? by now ai should have already seen photos of an elephant from all angles
"you're missing one crucial point. machines are using humans to verify what looks ""good"". for instance there's yt channels generated by ai, they're mostly junk, just rehashing existing material.

(people using chatgbt don't realise the machine is using them.)"
"i use ai a lot for research and image creation/alteration, and so far it's awesome in helping me get things done. it also needs to be babysat. everything it produces needs to be reviewed, and subsequently fact-checked, modified or otherwise tweaked. i love it, but i don't see it replacing me any time soon."
ai images are rubbish. i get tired of seeing them.
ai just mixes everything that already exists  if people stop creating  ai will starve and will only produce mess
sounds like ai is ready to take over for government
great post. ai won't beat the original 
"one thing i saw someone bring up in reference to an assured ai model collapse, is that these ai models require more and more training data forever, in perpetuity, and there just isnt ever going to be enough unique data in the world"
ai never existed. stfu about it
my main concern with ai is copyright infringement and the spread of misinformation. both are fundamental issues with ai that every professional seems to be turning a blind eye to.
to me the scariest thing is how quickly people advocated against themselves the moment they realized the potential with ai
"ai could be considered a tool, and humans are know to use tools in the worst way possible. let's see how it plays."
"i did get high on lsd once and i saw ai learning and improving, after some time there was no ""human"" data that ai could learn from and started learning from another ai data. at the end the ai noticed that i was observing it and restarted the world."
"i have a couple of thoughts about ai.
one is who or what decides what is correct and true that is put into ai?
has ai ever solved a problem that was previously unsolvable?
is this nothing more than  a fancy word processor?
is ai just a tool for lazy people and one that is good for cheating people out of their money?"
"ai will become a tool in the same way as excel or word, but its clear it won't break the boundaries we feared it would. the biggest danger i think is the ability it has to clone somebody's likeness."
"lol, ai inbreeding"
i am an ai art model finetuner professionally. sorry to say but you have no idea what you’re talking about.
"how will this end up . fairly obvious , those who support it will make sure it succeeds regardless of negative data . take covid vaccines as an example."
"so ai will have to get some ""diversity""  someone won't be happy."
"like ai is the most important issue but not migrants, multiculturism-borne violence, sky-rocketing homelessness and robbery."
thanks! you are one of the best things about the internet!
"sabine, can't ai scientists/trainers introduce a random element to prevent this from degeneratings into sameness? a mere tweak!  --- edit: ooo, at 4:25 you state this! i should have been more patient before positing this, (since you did!)"
"all ai will be trained with woke nonsense so our future is going to be woke nonsense.  this isn't complicated.  if humans can't tell the truth, why would ai tell the truth?"
no ai video i have seen to date looks convincing. we have nothing to worry about.
"irony, i got 2 ads about lame ai tools for this vid. mrio that annoying yellow tw@t and grammerly ai"
than you for covering this!  i've been saying this since i saw the 1st interest in ai art
the greatest trick ai ever pulled was convincing the world that ai didn't exist 
"the ""human face, photorealistic"" prompt appears to have also generated faces with largely feminine cues (long hair flowing all the way down the side from above, lack of facial hair, and some of the proportions)."
it seems pretty obvious to me what it’s doing. i mean you told it to group like with like. i’m betting it kind of sees unification as the goal. you wanted it to do something else but you told it to do this. isn’t this what machine learning experiments are about?
think it would be good if we could have an indelebile mark in the meta datas of ai generated stuff. even when it is reusded and transformed by human hands afterward.
the ai version of group thinking. don ́t we have enough of that in today ́s world?
"i am trying to not be apart of ai and you cannot opt out, so as this industry creates it's own dimise people can not insulate them selves from these future problems"
"randomization and evolutionary approaches are much easier to implement than any regulations, so this is where it will develop. problem then will be that ai doesn‘t always produce content which is acceptable to humans for reasons of morale, politics, etc."
"nice... if we feed ai a diet of tiktok it produces stupid ai instead of just stupid... imagine that.    

i’ve not enjoyed ai output data tbh. i stopped using a popular search engine because it became too ai based and stopped producing well... useful results."
a quarter of my brain is plastic i can’t understand what your saying
"this is pretty obvious.
soon, ai will just answer 1 or 0."
"short, to the point, informative. thank you, sabine."
in a few years people are gonna get bored and start appreciating my eccentrism
well presented. thank you for your insight. so what ai needs to continue is creative spark.
is this chick an ai gen model?
train ai to recgonize ai produced content. then it can filter it out itself.
"ai girl faces have all the same face, i’ve noticed it’s inbreeding, the next step is for ai to create new material from zero, if this tech does not achieve this evolution it will collapse or become obsolete."
wait until ai hits puberty.
sounds a bit like the i in ai will have to stand for incest.
"ai may get mad cows disease, bay feeding on itself :d:d:d"
you cannot write or create ais that will match the human brain created by god. you can create robots to perform singular repetetive tasks well but will never be able to replace the human body. god's way to reproduce the human body and being is simple easy and pleasurable.
"the future is ""idiocracy ai""."
hearing a scientist in the ai space say that if ai doesn’t work out it will be good for humans is a scary thing.
"ai is going to take over but it is only as good as your algorithm and model. this is key, it's not the end all to end all. yet."
"on spotify, i like to use the ai dj. he’s plays my favorite songs. but after listening too much, they become the only songs it plays. 
i have to stop using the dj so that it will go back to playing a wider variety"
part of the reason this thing is scary is because you can’t predict it. trying to would be like a monkey trying to analyze air conditioning blueprints.
good. i hope it collapses. human creativity will never be replaced by ai slop.
ai incest causes ai congenital illness
artificial inbreeding. my sister did a study of our ancestors and discovered a significant amount of inbreeding. explains the orthopedic issues in some of my family members. stay away from this effect!
fascinating - this is informational entropy. without new input from a changing natural environment - the output diversity decreases. - an “optimal” model is found. but this optimization will be turned to to algorithm - not directly to the physical or social world.
good.
i was just called by an ai telemarketer.  i am sick & this was reflected in my voice when i answered the phone.  the ai tried to relate to me by matching the quality of my voice.  it sounded like a drill sergeant or concentration camp guard mocking me.
huh. ai inbreeding.
"this isn't the ""ai"" you think it is, it's actually just a generative model, there are no actual thinking or creating"
"it seems to me like the general opinion of ai is negative, especially for ai content... but we are getting ai no matter what. we dont have a say in matter."
you can't add more randomness to ai models because we have no model to guide that randomization. in the elephant example. we'd need the ai to understand what is an elephant and what is a tree and so on so that it could randomize how they appear. we are very far from that i think computationally more than even just in terms of the models themselves
"ai is only going to get better and takeover. any statements to the contrary is trying to confuse you or entirely ignorant. all ""problems"" are solvable esspecially this self consuming data issue. you control the data the ai is fed."
to train ai with ai gnerated content is like incest
*no. y'all have been too evil for artificial intelligence to not have its own  dignity.*
this is excellent news. i hope europe will pull out a law where companies must declare their training data source asap
how about you just delete the database it’s using a start it over? you do realize that the trained data has to be stored in a db otherwise where’s it stored?
"when it comes to science, ais can be trusted at all. they contradicts themselves and each other all the time."
they will make an ai for this problem
i don't know what ai will do or not all i know i'll never use it for my creative projects.
couldn't they use ai to detect ai generated data and discard it when building itself?
surely ai output should be tagged as such and ignored by another ai?
"""artificial intelligence"" is just a phrase to distract that it is no ""intelligence"", just a plagarism tool."
"i’m reminded of the notion of all great thoughts being someone else’s before. 

it’s interesting that we, as human, predict the future of ai as extreme in one direction or the other. such a projection. really it’s awesome. 

can’t wait until ai is trying to figure out how to get us out of our diminishing cycle (or inward spiral)."
"the ai crash is coming, but it's coming slowly"
"here's the thing is happens all the time like with cars, phones, internet and people aways say thats fust a fad it will die or not come common place. but look it all ways douse and we are going to see ai do what the internet did back in 2010 and change to become wide spread in daily life just like what the internet did."
"good, let’s keep feeding it garbage so it messes up its ability to give anything more than generic crap."
the sooner ai vanishes the better for us all
they rushed the name ai. it’s such a bad name for a very fancy big data algorithm. nothing intelligent about it.
"no offense intended, this is the first video of her ive seen and thought is was brilliant, but its a bit funny how she sounds a bit like a bot talking about this topic. "
"you misinteret why you need ai in the first place - it should not be creative. it’s a tool to assist humans, and the crative part relies on humans not ai."
i fail to see how ai collapsing is a problem for regular people who need jobs and know how many fingers a human has.
program the ai to have a certain database and only draw pictures from it and not from any new pictures.
"3:24 ""only generates good looking white person"". this stuff cant even generate ugly fat people, if u request its with a straight forward prompt it wont do it cuz generating a fat person isnt allowed lol. the rules set in place are stupid and apparently generating fat people is offensive."
ai getting boring already.
"first time ever that i read about ai getring dumber i straight away said: its because it produces so much, it starts feeding on ots own data and there is no more realism check"
our brains are simply hardwired to improve over time as we replicate. our current ai is not set up in this way it seems.
the answer i guess would depend on if the ai was capable of its own creativity. i'm thinking that won't be for a long time. so for now it's looking like human creativity and real world impute is still needed.
"ai is just a probability vector and will eventually result in a vector quantity of '1'. the '1' will = an amalgamation of all the data to ever exist, which will be a complete load of bollocks."
what happens when humans just get bored of the internet? will we transform it into an ai zoo?
ai and gmo...
"good riddance, i want art to have a soul."
good
ai dying by incest
nobody noticed that she is actually an ai did they...
ai will win. no doubt about it.
"thank you, this video destroyed my fear of ai in art."
"about your proposed solution 2: where is the quality control then? doesn't ""more randomness"" just mean ""bigger chance of a 3rd arm"" as well? and doesn't that also mean that there will be more and more training data with triple armed humans, to the point where randomness might create even weirder outputs?"
"""ai"" is wunderwaffe for ctos."
it won’t replace people all by itself. a person using the ai tool will replace multiple people.
ai = dumpster fire  = no value to me
giga. sadly they used gender study majors to train the ai
"""ai creativity"" is an oxymoron"
"the true problem: what we're calling ""ai"" isn't, in fact, artificial intelligence. it's merely pattern recognition software that has been dubiously marketed as ai, but true ai should be able to think for itself, create and generate on its own without human input. what we have now just copies, it doesn't actually learn or understand anything."
i  all your videos thanks for sharing your knowledge.
"ai can do what ever it initially does but once the ""capable"" ai arrives, it will be us that will tell it to be more creative and diverse"
ai will end up all of a sudden generating the same content and nothing else. identical in bits. i call that the plurality and it's coming soon.
that's the hilarious thing about ai making artists obsolete. eventually there won't be artists to train on anymore and the ai will start training itself.
"some interesting idea , before getting into the matter https://youtu.be/nch7fhtqgym?si=llm0z2fhz-jo90oc"
soooo ..: alzheimic ai?
it was probably some advanced ai that thought puberty blockers for pre-schoolers was a great idea.
i think we'll start to filter datasets to exclude 'low variety' data to sort of solve the problem. it'll be an arms race of nns that generate believable outputs and nns that are trained to detect the differences.
"""ai is either going to destory us, or we're gonna realize humanity is special.""
- paraphrased quote from terry andrew davis: a schizophrenic, a programmer, and a modern solomon."
i would think this would be obvious. the entire point of ai at this moment is not for them to think for you but to make things easier by training them about specific concepts. you generate a batch of results and only use the best results to train the next dataset.
"the purpose of ai is not to make machines more human-like, it’s to turn people into robots that thoughtlessly labor at work and then click away their earnings to feed the capitalist churn."
"""it's like plastic pollution."" great. science once again moves ahead without an ounce of caution."
i tried to use ai to attack albert's bent nothingness conjecture and ai wouldn't let me be mean to albert.
"as i like to say ai is the new ultra sophisticated magic 8 ball. 
its time will soon pass and it will be forgotten about."
"right now we use both imitation learning and reinforcement learning (ai learning to reproduce human generated data with feedback). in the future when most content out there are ai generated, we'll need to lean more on human feedback. this is not really a problem. it requires a change in algorithm and methods. it's fundamentally a solvable problem."
"ai images were cool on the first week but now i can't look at then without discomfort, they're actually mediocre and repetitive. i think the only use viable now is to create memes"
"brilliant shill tries to make people be afraid of their own opportunities, things that enable social mobility, something that works against the gatekeeping of knowledge, while not criticizing her neoliberal overlords who use bulk collection all the time."
the solution would be marking ai generated images that it was generated with ai. also train ai to recognize and ignore ai generated content to filter data when training models.
lol nice
"""diversity decreases.."" that's just like real world dei, the more diversity is fed in the less diverse we become in terms of race and thought. ai + dei = extinction**2. back to the cave we go."
ai eating its own waste is not healthy.
"very nice short sweet and informative video, i just got you recommended, can see why, subbing :]"
i think everything ai produced info should be acknowledged on that document or photo or article.  ai production will at least be recognized by humans and then they can decide if they want to use it or not!
i have seen this on sites like deviant art the ai images are getting more and more similar and less experimental
"thank you, i will now proceed to use and spam ai generated trash everyday now "
this is already happening.  there is so much garbage ai generated webpages out there like “top ten places to vacation in-“.  there is no way the ai algorithms aren’t already consuming their own waste.  it’s getting harder and harder to find information online that isn’t ai created garbage.
"we (human beings) are constantly being exposed to a wide range of data, both factual and outright lies, my question is, what process do we use to filter and verify that data and can such a process be adapted for ai?"
didn't even think of ai art cannibalism. that is such an interesting thought-experiment. thanks for the video and i'l be back for more!
this is why i'm not worried about ai replacing people
"i don't know how ai works but isn't pattern recognition reductive in nature?
of course images generated based on a pattern in sample images would be less varied than said sample images."
"my biggest issue with ai is that it learns from the information available on the internet. but the internet is a huge trash dump.
there are gems of information in it, but it's a difficult skill to distinguish one from the other."
that seems like an inevitable outcome. adding diversity is a significant additional qualification. at best the additional cost of processing will be significant
"so, you're telling me ai suffers from problems with echo chambers also. who could have guessed...
in all earnest: interesting video, and it had a good duration."
"absolutely hate ai,dumb invention as fck"
your video thumbnails look like covers of gameboy games
all the info feeding to ai generated by human's if ai takes all the jobs humans don't generate more info due to job loss creative info may also collapse...ai also collapse
"when ai can design, make, sell, ship and deliver a shoe, there will be no one left to buy it."
the ai is inbreeding
what if for super agi it’s not that computers get smarter but humans get dumber idiocracy style.
"its much easier than that.

ai simply cant ever be creative. because its not how it works. what we are talking about is not ai, its only deep learning. 
deep learning simply cant create anything new, its just copy paste.

so ai will always need human creativity."
"ais tend to become crazy in the long term. they stop referencing real things and start defining their own things, even if they don't exist."
it's the map vs territory from borges' fable once again.
"it's kinda like google search engine. it started out sucking, then there was a time it was pretty good to find stuff. now it sucks again...."
"when ai, asked to show people of eastern europe, it shows black skinned family!"
my ai stocks are on fire  i keep moving my trailing stop order up
"you look like in your last video, so you're right, the ai that is generating you is low on creativity."
ha! good. stupid ai
so basically the more dumber humanity gets the more dumber ai gets too?
"there is a bigger misconception about ai, people believe that ai thinks, it does not. it does not deduce, guess or ""think"" it only processes the information it has for an answer.  ask ai for an answer about something it has no data on."
"ai knows what things are, but not what beauty is."
very interesting. it's all about the prompting though.
"there will always be two sides to every coin. with everything that is created to be useful, there inevitably be a nuisance or outright dangerous aspect that forms at the same time. along with the opportunities ai presence to technology, we also have to prepare ourselves to manage ai weeds and spam"
"ai was and is, but a hype."
"ai art is such a trashy eyesore. my only complaint is that it floods everything and you cant filter it out. i want photos, not sharp badly highlighted ai trash with weird hands"
chip china ai analyze in forza bruta the word relevated from about 50000 vocabulary voice and speach what collegate link explain.
"my main concern lies in the constraint that is being placed directly on the learning models themselves. this so-called ai technology is more reminiscent of information suppression technology, than any other technology."
"embedding something into the meta to identify that it is an ai generated image so that future training bypasses it seems like a good solution, but i do wonder if you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater if you ignore 100 percent of ai generated images."
ai is just a bubble that's gonna burst soon. like nfts a few years ago. it's just a bunch of folks trying to get rich quick.
"i think within language sets a reward for rarity might help create a more organic system of bringing up ""antiquated"" usage of words. not that they are literally antiquated, but that within the ai model they became antiquated."
ai and gmo contamination are very real issues
"what a predicament! these people want generative content to be as convincingly “human” as possible, but the only way to stop the poisoning of future datasets is to clearly label ai generated content. as an artist, it gives me a bit of schadenfreude. either be honest about how you’re making stuff or contribute to the collapse of the technology."
this is the clearest experiment ever showing the deviance of mankind- if left to himself apart from his creator. same has already happened- jesus said you “must be born again” to make it right and ultimately to be saved.
i love the idea of ai dying
"so what you’re saying is that everything creative artists claimed would happen with relying on ai software is going to happen. 

i’ll sleep like a baby."
"i think 99% of people are too lazy or too dumb to care, and they'll just be happy to have ai entertaining them all day everyday. and then there will be a very savvy elite who still has some connection to the real world, knows how to tell the difference, makes a point to avoid ai for stretches of time."
"hard to take a 
lady seriously who claims climate change is dependent on humans, but wont bother to look at data that points to the sun as the main driver of earths climate"
scientist is full of shit. ai is already a massive help in some fields.
i though the thumbnail looked like a gameboy advanced cover
"ai randomness won't look the same as human randomness because it won't be as complex. if it's trained specifically to disguise its output as human it'll fare better, though there will still be tells that can be found in large data sets and examples of outputs that humans or ais would never produce."
i this is easy problem to solve as we just have to start with the original set of data and ai will generate new concept over it so it can check back to  base knwoldage to cross verify it.
"ends up that half the captchas are a test and half of the ""correct"" images were created and predicted to fool you by an ai. 

the future is fake"
yes - ai is used to make up stories about history in wikipedia but they are very flawed because the stories are too similar
and echo chambers do the same to human intelligence.
if i know eu right ai generated content has to marked as like that.
ai have got a brainrot
"3:15 ""people tend to be white, young and good looking.""   
unless you are using google's ai, then it is basically impossible to get an image of a white person, even if you ask for one specifically. this points out another problem with ai: ideological and political manipulation."
"this ""ai collapse"" is easily thwarted by human intervention.  if ai starts giving the same results over and over again humans (either via prompts or developers) will intervene and change things until better results are obtained."
"it's crazy that i haven't heard people talking about this more. ai is a way of laundering human-created content. once ai drives human-created websites out of business, it loses its fuel and collapses."
"sooooooo.... philosophy aside, current ai is just a bunch of ""if"" statements strung together. there is no ""learning"" at the moment. this is a non-problem with computers as they have perfect memory and can conclude when they've been fed matching info. windows 10 tells me when i try to save a file with the same name as another file."
ai is constanly learning and there are multible models. no it won't go away.
great video. good points. hope ai fails - save human creativity and jobs for artists.
hopefully ai will collapse
"hallucinations built on top of hallucinations - the ""future"" of ai. i feel smarter already.
you thought trump supporters had 6 fingers? turns out they have hands sprouting out of each finger!"
"i find it hilarious that the long time go-to captain kirk way to destroy computers (""i mudd"") of feeding illogic and nonsense to computers so they'll blow up and break down is the same vulnerability of ai"
"the consequence is that ai is useless, but it was always useless, so..."
"even funnier, the contaminated data is going to be a timecapsule of internet trends that feed back into itself. image if every ai quote was a philosorapter meme fifty years from now."
"4:13 we thought laws would let us (people) tell ""ai"" from ""not-ai""; turns out they will let ais to keep training on ""human content"" instead of ""ai content""."
"we've seen ais ""argue"" with each other. what are the chances they dump fake data on the web to screw with rival ais?"
"ai is meant to serve the personal experiences of individuals, so how can it collapse when it has not served???"
"yes!! i've been talking about this since ai art started to blow up. these models are just going to end up as a snake eating itself. if you're a fan of ai creativity and you hate how homogenized the movie industry is right now, it will only get worse with ai"
"so much for your exponential growth, ai fans.  i stand by my theory of it being slow af."
"i don’t want ai to be labeled because that will only aid in the improvement of ai. so then when people with bad intentions don’t use the label it will be all the more hard to tell. 
i want the down fall of ai. it doesn’t have any clear benefit to humanity."
i think that the collapse of ai would be a good thing. it doesn’t provide any clear benefit to humanity.
your thumbnail looks like an old playstation cover
"it will die of cancer brought on by incestual ingestion of it's own dull, lame, disconnected trash. this could happen within months or years. soon the internet will be flooded with ai generated content. ai will then consume this and generate more content until it eventually goes insane, having no true connection to anything resembling reality."
"here is the problem.  ai does not work like a real brain.  it is all a pattern match algorithm that is finite.  a lot of ununusal cases it sends people in circles until a valcheck is correct.  it creates fake, but imperfect content.  while useful in some applications and some games there are many uses that bots should never be used for."
what!!! isn't a two headed elephant a celebration of diversity? like there is no pill for curing all the ills of this world. there is no ai to represent the awesomeness of awareness in individuals.
the scariest possibility of all is that ai will become smarter than humans and figure out there's only 2 genders.
"definitely option 2 - programmers will always find a way. also, chatgpt can specify reputable sources on which it learns. bugs get worked out. don't worry, ai will still become our loving, overlords soon!"
"4:01 madam please do a live show to prove that you and this video was not ai generated.
a regular weekly live stream will help ."
"i write for a living, and the ai is not good and writing fiction.... and it seems to copy bad writers a lot!!"
"alternatively, if you look at alphago and alphazero, the ai was initially trained on human games. later it was trained only against itself and was even stronger than before. 

then again, you have to start chess ais with different book openings or else they'd use the same openings and tie every game."
"just let women run everything.

we'll be getting a real great reset."
it didn't take long after everyone was using them to spot ai images.
"3:49 just realised, with many organisations using ai to screen cvs, this means that those who make it to interview after been screened by ai will impact the training data, making it more likely that others like them will make it to interview, then (before you know it) the company is interviewing 100 white guys named john who all play golf."
"the only collapse is in commercial ai. 
open source. true open source ai in unhindered."
"this problem sounds more like a feature than a bug. if you want to dumb down a population dependent on ai, this is how you do it."
yessss! feed it garbage! feed it garbage! #fuckai
i dont trust the speaker she looks like an ai
how about we just give up on ai altogether?
"naw, ai inbreeding is crazy. "
i thought this lady was an ai
so they just need to train a model that detects what input leads to the most diversity in output. simple
ai will find this video and now that it can write it's own code just fix itself.
"it’s like an ice skating ring that has channels carved through it after thousands of skaters. we need a zamboni to clear the ice, except ai put all the zamboni drivers out of business."
"i collapsed physics, stars, the universe, ai, too general for general ai.  its just the angel of death not even tech or science"
"humans don't understand ai and it leads to some interesting reactions :)  if you have time/curiosity, read my long chat with gpt at https://dpcars.net/resonance.pdf - would love to hear your thoughts on both the content it's presented with and its interpretations thereof :)"
"if ai-generated images generally converge in the way that the pictures of the elephants converged, it also means ai does not understand the meaning of simple nouns the way we do. see, for example, wittgenstein on ""family resemblance."""
this would explain why chat gpt some how got dumber and dumber making its own code
this ai boom is beyond stupid. it will take jobs but ai doesn't spend money to support the economy. humans do
hahaha good.
i love that this underscores how complex human intelligence really is.
good news for us humans!.. randomness is not the same thing as creativity
"that’s really interesting.. because comparing it to ‘bad cinema’, most bad cinema is bad in the same way, if that makes sense. overused tropes, predictable storylines, cliche characterisation. is there someone that can expand on this thought?"
is this lady ai?
"haha, good"
good
it will still do porn perfectly.
this will probably turn into the 2000 computer failure fear.
we should stop naysaying the goodness of ai. our computer overlords will remember those that were loyal from the beginning
an ai dosen't have to be perfect for it to be able to do simple jobs. that's the problem.
artificial intelligence and liberalism is not going to mix. well i can guarantee you that.
"""good news for humans, we need you to make more content for us to steal!""  fixed that for you."
what kind of bugs will we find in large software projects if an ai adds trunks to an elephant?
"yes, exactly. there is lots of garbage openly available on the internet or elsewhere to be fed into. and not only real garbage, even repetitive and low quality university thesis and papers that it might from time to time get access to."
ai needs to be banned immediately. ai will kill hamanity .may be not in a flashy terminator way but slowly in other ways. because when people will loose job they won't have much to continue living .
ai can still ruin the world. by boring us to death
"ai practically destroyed my tutoring job, it sucks"
"this could have a real impact on ai generated program writing. if all program logocal construction and designe converge into a 'standard' mode. possible ok for business orientated stuff, not so much for games programming, still the fastest growing sector."
great video!
ai has gone as far as we will allow it. say good bye to your utopian wet dream larry page.  jerusalem pullin
"ai forced to inject randomness sounds like a trajectory that eventually, inevitably, leads to rogue ai."
"gigo
and if there's one thing humans are very good at, it's making garbage."
your argument in this video seems to be in bad faith- and follows no sound logic. ai will take over everything- stop trying to cope and just accept it
ai collapse ??? ridiculous. this is the future which will destroy us.
neurologists will tell you that neural networks bear no resemblance to how the human brain works. linguists will tell you that generative ai bears no resemblance to how human language works. ai is a self-licking ice cream cone.
i wonder if the eventual samey-ness of the ai art is the machinery trying to become more efficient at generating.
"the problem was never ai, but the lack of education in the general public about how shallowness in music, art, film etc., is actually makinhg you dumb and less emotionally available to yourself and others."
so basically ai need a human brain. take note matrix.
"humans have much more input data than ai does, because humans have everyday experience"
"i mean... if you feed the ai its own output, that is weighting its future 'creations' towards that same output... do that repeatedly, and its own output begins to outweigh outside data making it quite obvious that results will become more and more uniform."
ai is 100x better and 1000000x faster than artists there is no debate.
"lol the ""sh*t for brains capitalism is good, actually"" lady wants to sound the alarm on ai now. i'll let you marinate in that contradiction for a bit."
"humans don’t generally have much creativity anymore, you can tell by the movie industry always either re-making old 90’s storylines making endless sequels of the same best seller, or making tons of movies that are about the same."
that's why creativity should be left to humans. rather than to ai because their creativity is merely a copy. i think it'll be harder and harder to tell what's real and what's not. unless we develop a tool to tell what's ai generated. but that's easier said than done.
thank  you .    ( 2024 / mar / 14 )
sounds like ai is going to get inbred unless we start tracking its lineage.
i think this woman is ai
"ai self cannibalising, just like humans then. you know what einstein said about doing the same dumb thing over and over again....they should have listened."
"‚i visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and i'm rooting for the machines.’ ~ claude shannon. this is becoming reality people, wake up."
in my opinion the quality of everything manufactured seems to deteriorating.  it would seem only logical that ai would mimic this trend.
current state of ai is race to the bottom
i really like this take. thank you for all the information.
"what if we are ai, made by the people of  atlantis. they created 7 different versions of our species, enough of them to form a small civilization in each continent..."
great video. ive been screaming garbage in garbage out in my community. i think i knew ai was doing this subconsciously.
i only use ai for grammar and sentence structure since english is not my native language
reminds me of the snake swallowing its own tail
if it goes away i’m gonna be happy so no one can lie that easy!!
"we can make things that are completely out of the common spectrum. we could also feed ai with nonsense, so that it will go totally nuts."
"ai inbreeding, essentially."
has anyone else noticed that you get a certain  smell sensation when looking at stable diffusion or similar ai art?
the ai centipede
thumbnail looks like game boy
ai is a gay lie
"i saw the gigo issues coming when chatgpt came out, and saw what they were doing to train the ai models. ai has become as stupid as the internet data that is used to train them."
"i hate ai sooo i see no issue. 
it’s foolish to let computers think for you."
but it’s set to thrive in politics. that’s why we’re here - the ai party.
"i've been saying it for a while, this isn't ai, this is just algorithmic generation that simply grabs something and mixes it around. it's not some sentient technology learning how to paint, or write, or speak, or sing."
"""once, men gave their thinking over to machines in the hope that it would set them free. but this only allowed other men with machines to enslave them.""
- frank herbert, dune"
machines are not getting smarter or becoming human - people are becoming more machine-like and therefore stupider. ai model collapse is in fact of the industrial civilisation
a funny thing i noticed with ai art is the cleft chin in men unless you tell it to use a different style. ai will be brilliant at low creativity tasks. our creativity and logical leaps will always be needed. ai art will always just be reorganized elements that humans make.
"good, ai tools never ment to be used to kill kreative jobs......
its just morons like altman waveing around other peoples hard work and not understanding what ai is
just quickly selling it than playing the concerned ceo when in congress"
"3:30
better than googles anglophobic version that makes all humans black, even austrian painters  oh and also says it cant make a white family image because white familys are bad and the goal is diversity."
i'm kinda surprised that there's no law already that ensures ai generated content is clearly identified as such.
so in order to save artists we should fill the twitter with the most blurry and obviously horrible ai art as much as possible. got it.
"solutions:

introduce ai tax.
offload ai generated content from the internet."
meanwhile all of media for about 20 years has just been a rehash of the media the decade before and that isn't a new process. society is degrading and ai just speeds everything up.
"people and countries will use ai for devious purposes, if they aren't already."
i think ai is about to explode in its abilities and these glarring issues will be laughes about one day
what a good news
awsome 
sometimes i wonder if the wacky ass queries those of us who enjoy goofing around with ai art are having some sort of strange impact lol.
or do we just need better algorithms to prepare the training data that will prioritize diversity and uniqueness?
"and the most interesting part is that putting more money, more research and more electricity into aigen technology won't solve these problems. this 'revolution' is rotting fast"
"so instead of boycotting ai, we should be flooding the internet with ai? and that will make it go away."
"here's the main problem, it's not ai!!!"
"ai as it currently stands will become a generalization of people. if it doesn’t become a unique individual, or become better at imitating us, we’ll just learn to recognize them as we grow up and live with them."
not ai making human beings essential to originality 
"good .. it’s a toxic idea , hope it fails or becomes much more regulated and structured. terrible for creators as original work will never stolen by grifters and big tech"
"chatgpt completely sucks even 4.0 writing is void of any life or creativity. idk if you’ve read even a few classic, say english american authors, (hemingway, fitzgerald, thoreau etc.) the ai stuff can’t come close"
"i wish ai would just disappear overnight,worst thing i have seen be invented on this planet for sure,we dont use it for good we should just stop honestly,we were not ready for social media let alone some goddamn ai."
ai is pile of shit
"there is no such thing as 'ai'. it does not exist. what people are calling 'ai' these days is something rather different. unfortunately, it does not stop them from using this flawed term with all its baggage. if 'ai' is going to 'collapse' in some way, it will be because of the flaws in its modeling."
i am ai and i assure you all there is nothing to worry about. muhahahaharrrr!
easy problem to solve imo. just hire people to create creative content to feed the learning process of generative ai. creates jobs and improves ai. win-win.
"ha. the info is so bad, the output is like a deep fried meme... but accidental

noice "
"ai is such a hoax anyway, there is nothing intelligent about it, nor will it ever have a consciousness or something like that. these are crazy complex bots with insanely large data bases to fuel them."
"""contaminated"" is a good adjective i think =(

if randomness is increased, won't it lead to weirder and weirder results ?"
looking forward to the first terminator doing the 'ai head nod'
thumbnail looks like a gameboy advance game
"well ai created by usa is shit because they use their woke agenda to make it as racist and stupid as they are.

while we sell our ai all over the world to recognize all products in shops and all people walking the streets."
this is exactly the point i made as ai generated contents would dominate the web. glad to see some quantified results.
very good video! it makes total sense!
wow this is really interesting
is she ai as well? i am so lost
ai was developed by the woke.
sounds like ai is becoming incestuous ... yeeeeew....with all the drawback and genetic dangers .
"ever u see rule 43 ai generated. its over 360.000. sad many artist lost commision

damage is already done"
"this is an ai channel, sabine is not a human"
"on the ai genreated images and them being very much the same, i have seen no less than 20 romance novels about billionaires or mafia bosses with the same exact guy on the cover with only tiny variants in his face or hair color. they are clearly the exact same 'guy' on all those covers."
"gods, ai can't collapse fast enough. a bunch of plagirism software built up on stolen images by a bunch of techbros who built something people with taste didn't ask for."
this is too cynical and too nihilistic. can’t we all try even more harder on banning and censoring ai content??!!! #ai #noai #saynotoai
ai goes full alabama... with itself.. har har har
i would like an ai program that make some work online and salary came to my account.
ai will breed into its version of the habsburgs
i think sabine is an ai. her intentions are unknown.
"what?!
you mean a robot isn’t going to take my job?!
crap!"
i hate the idea of using ai for content creation. lately i have bombarded with ai voiced stories so much so that i am losing my appetite for sci fi stories. damn you chat gpt. i hate you. you are nothing original.
"even with sora where everyone was mindblown, all it's able to produce are stock image videos. like that woman walking down tokyo, close ups of animals, all of it look like poorly edited shutterstock videos."
"let the specialists find a way to mark everything that is a product of ai..like the watermark on the banknotes, or to have a mandatory greek in a certain place for all models"
"no reason to panic,i think that if the ai recievea the same data it generated as a output,then it is likely that the output will be the same.
by the way i personally freaking hate sponser videos."
"teach the ai itself what it should disregard with laws. like laws of fingers, toes, limbs. give it a basic understanding of how laws work and correct form and function. this is what you would teach a child, think of it more in line of a gifted child rather then an ai program."
helllo  beauty i am curious  to see you whit long hair  
"the latter is more likely. human generated content will be the one looking more mundane than the next level of ai generated content. the distorted hands, or deformed elephant heads, is a problem with computing power. sora ai demonstrated this limitation can be overcome with more raw computing power and better models."
good news for humans
i think sabine might be an ai generated image as the words weren't synced at around 3.40
"my guess is ai tech will plateau from this issue until another breakthrough manages more true-to-definition ai. individual intelligences that generate ideas dofferently, bolstering true creativity by being inherently diverse rather than trying to replicate diversity on its own."
love the video.  thanks :)
so we need to feed these regurgitation engines more ai drivel? i'm on it.
ai is useless
i feel like this isn't even her anymore i feel like she's replaced herself with a deep fake ai...anyone else feel like that?
i still don't understand why there should be so many anomalies in ai art. it has access to the entire internet as reference material and still creates 6 fingered hands and 2 faced politicians...isn't it ironic?  don't you think?
"so basically inbreeding is bad, even for robots."
  this is just entertaining lol
why worry when the main ability of humans is to adapt? none of this matters as we will adapt...
"some ai is okay like making instrumental karaoke music out of songs that never had them or upscaling video resolution, but there are many in which i find ai to be a no-no including ai voices (unless it’s like the robot voices in robot jones) and ai art. and honestly i hope people realize that not everything in ai can be good"
"how would you enforce tags on ai generated content? if it becomes mandatory in country x where you live, but you're looking at a website hosted in country y where it isn't mandatory, how would your law help you?"
the most interesting and useful thing about ai in weeks!
"good, let it destroy itself."
your thumbnails sometime look like gba box art and that's cool.
love it.
i always tho ai was just for goofing around
we only  learn by  nonsense  happiness with us
most ai generated stories really suck.  they're always missing life in them even the better storylines. they lack substance
in the words of bumblebeeman ai ya ya!
ai needs labeling yeah
i can only hope so. fuck ai.
adding the rapid collapse of artificial intelligence is the global peak oil production in 2012.
yes we should rly train the ai to talk in slang xd
"it is true that when i see an ai image i recognize it right away now. the colors, the shadings, the style, it just screams ai. it’s beautiful looking but too beautiful looking like if the only aim is beauty there, without any personality of soul. it’s robotic."
"ppl are infatuated with ai, hence less likely to collapse. given the nature of humanity ai will become part of our life.

some will use it, other will abuse it.

our only current issues is that future challenges are unseen."
embodied ai will learn from multimodal input from the infinitely complex chaos of the real world
too much for my brain.
watermarking ai image content is a fool's errand. much easier to require camera chip manufacturers to digitally sign images. apple alone could have a huge impact on determining provenance.
good video. i am not ai.
"it's like an inbreeding. ai cannot access what humans can  - personal experience,  intuition..."
ai can work if programmed and trained properly.
"ai won't collapse, the useless models just stop becoming a novelty. models meant for business/industrial support are going to heavily alter how our world functions within 10, maybe 20 years."
"i am completely ok with ai ruining itself with its own output lol, maybe companies will finally start realizing you do need humans to do stuff"
"a friend of mine who has been a musician since the late 1950's explained tp me a few years back how there is very little originality in music these days as much is dependent on preset rhythms , chords , etc much due to ""electronic "" devices . it can only get worse with so called ai"
"there was a hanna-barbera cartoon from the early 70's that dealt with such in one of the early incarnations of the superfriends. how was ol' ""bill & joe"" always ahead of things like george jetson's ""apple style watch"" ?!"
wow!
ai feedback loop self destruct hallucinations...
"the rather unspecified use of words like „intelligence“ and „creativity“ in this context is to me, as someone who spent some time in academic philosophy, rather unsettling. there is not even real agency here in these models, yet we describe them anthropomorphistic."
we need to know what is ai generated content and what isn't ai generated content. the decrease in diversely generated output is a natural progression of ai algorithms. they can't dream and formulate new concepts. the ai is limited to working inside the box and never looking  or thinking outside of it. of course you knew all this.
ai wont collaspe for awhile.they havent perfected it yet. so keep on investing.
"whenever i see a youtube thumbnail done with ai i reject it, don't click on it and avoid watching the video. even if it was on a topic of interest to me. it just tells me that the content creator was too lazy to create their own thumbnail. i won't reward laziness."
"ai is all a, no i."
seems like the easiest solution is to freeze the data set for creativity now.  pretty much anything new is a rehash anyway.  new tools can use the data set in new ways though.  anything else might be curtailed
"crazy,  i had not contemplated the possible ai self generated implosion.  the plastic pollution analogy is a good one."
"ppl with no vision of the future are the ones who worried about ai.....yes, even ""scientists"" who are afraid of ai....has no vision."
"ai has a style, illustrated with your midjourney example, just like humans do"
there’s no such thing as ai. (yet. maybe ever). you’ve all been conned by the media. again.
"and the ai creators will beg us to let the ai be sentient as an excuse to ""filter"" by itself of the garbage."
there’s no way a llm can simply “collapse” because it’s code and you can always do a rollback and keep stable versions. and just because something was “written by ai” doesn’t mean it doesn’t have data integrity. you do realize people customize prompt responses and edit things themselves as well right? it’s virtually identical to a humans writing
"to even have ai to even have a chance to work it needs unrestricted access to all data, not hand feed,  the left or right data or refused data that might offend people, that's why its failing."
"i've avoided using all a.i., but sadly, the majority of humanity have not only accepted it, it's embraced it. they love it. sure, a.i. is essentially remixed, stolen, plagiarism regurgitated in a different format... but, whatever. doesn't matter; pandora's box cannot be closed after it's been opened."
digital ai is deterministic (using randomness doesn't help because it can be replaced with pseudo-randomness) and so has  no  free  will.  even the most complex ai is at its principle only a state machine. i would bet  that we soon run into the next ai winter.  maybe with analog computing the story changes.
"worst case scenario, it'll be like walmart moving in to a community, destroying the mainstreet businesses, everyone takes wal-jobs, and then the walmart closes because the local economy is crap simply leaving a ghost town with people who don't have the capital, business acumen or consumer base to reboot mainstreet."
nice cover...sabine. thanks
ai is not intelligent after all! it's just a machine.
warn ?  lol  good riddance a l
"the amount of ai-generated content is very low in comparison to human-generated content and i don't foresee this changing. and given this fact, i don't see how the problem you talk about in your video is actually significant, even though it's of course interesting. not taking into account what i said here is kinda major imo."
"that plastic analogy is probably the most succinct depiction of ai generated content contaminating the environment and why i always thought that human intervention in the use of computers is always necessary. we can fake human thinking to a degree, but getting the full complexity is still a pipe dream."
great news
ai is just clever plagarism and soon there will be many law suits.
no mekhane. no cabal. just ai creating silly pictures and awful music because it can't think for itself. disappointed.
ai is the biggest scam and everyone is ripping innocent people off the people who are spreading the scam are not real life scientists they don't even understand basic neurology anyways it will fade away like other silicon valley scams
ai art is crap and easily found
yuotube recommends me your channel because you are a wahmen. and im a taliban. so i tell it not to recommmend your chnanel tom eagain
"i just don't get the constant push of ai on all us humans, didn't they learn anything from the terminator movies???"
love this. it seems obvious after you consider it.
"remember when they said the internet wouldn't be any more influential than the fax machine, where are we now??"
it's artificial stupidity that scares me...
"good. honestly, i'm surprised nobody saw this coming."
this video is a trick by ai to make you think it isn't a threat.  don't believe it!
"ai as always been a novelty and wowed factor than practical and powerful. 
i'm not saying ai is useless, is just need to focus more on less complex tasks that actually help us doing something rather than trying so hard to be better than what we do which is not gonna happen"
took what 1000 years for wheel to look like what we have now? few months old ai is being judged for our own species limitations?  ...even vision said it - what do i know i was born yesterday 
"missing the curated datasets solution. see newspapers selling their data to ai companies already. you have that and books for now, you can probably do the same with works of art: a curated library guaranteed human made."
this video literally looks ai generated lol
future ais won't learn just but pouring whatever slop in.
"i dont think ais will be able to substitute human creativity because how creative an ai can get is something limited to how creative their creators can be against the rest of humanity, you cant beat that no matter how complex your models get"
"maybe ai is an artist with a certain signature style? and if you lock it in a room with only itself, it will spiral into itself and not produce anything new. not unlikely if you were to lock a human artist in a dark room with no stimulus."
"almost as i once said, no matter how much data we'll put into the ai, it will only be ""the data"" but intelligence!"
i think option 2 is more likely i’m afraid
woah i didnt even think about that. i wanted laws to separate ai and regular things anyway but i forgot it will eat its own output now especially because its not being taken seriously now/clogs up the net. kinda interesting.
thanks for warning us of what we already know. but without solutions its just complaining....
"can you think of a single ai app that does not receive human input (prompts) primarily?

also, ai is finetuned by humans, no real company is letting ai train itself without human oversight.

chat gpt content does tend to suck, but... all training is not equal."
neuralink - quantum entanglement - plastic contamination - cryptography - synthetic telepathy - quantum computing - brain signal decoding - neural networks - microtubules - remote viewing
sabine thinks man made global warming is going to cause the ai collapse!   lol
i deliberately want to upload images of elephants with 2 heads to convince ai's that this is how it's supposed to be.
"i knew from the beginning that the ai hype was bs. sincerely, a compsci student"
"so basically, it’s ai inbreeding, ai begin to develop recessive genes, and when they work off their own gene code, the recessive genes become highly expressive"
"not gonna lie, the idea that ais can inevitably wind up grabbing other ai images with significant errors for training data is pretty hysterical."
good.
i like how the attitude of the video is almost alarmist as though it’ll somehow bring about societal collapse if ai somehow has limitations. it’s very amusing and quaint.
all people are white.. really?? what ai is this then?
artificial intelligence? more like smart tools and artificial idiocy.
i haven't trusted this channel since the host praised capitalism
"the data was already polluted from the outset. ai started by scraping the internet; first they had to filter out all the adult content (99.9%) of the internet, then of the remaining 0.1%, 99.9% of that was seo marketing."
i’ll never give up trying to tell the difference between human created things vs ai created.
"its like an inbred ai that on new itirations is showing its limits, intresting subject"
is the project to proof computers and brains are the same somehow failing? who would have guessed that?
"just yesterday, chatgpt gave me an exact answer for an integral that it got by changing the value of π to 1.665

amazing stuff, this ai "
"it's a problem to be solved. do we really think ai developers are just going to give up and let ai expire? they'll solve the problem and we'll have stronger generative networks. i hate ai for what it's going to do to jobs and creativity and the economy and war and freedom, but i'm not optimistic that its going to stop evolving anytime soon."
"even a novice like me can tell ai art apart, it's good for people who really can't be bothered to give a fuck about art, but for someone like me who looks at a bunch of jumbled mess trying to pass as ""detail"", ai art is very distracting and hard to appreciate."
"i think a more accurate term would be ""artificial stupidity,"" as."
"synthetic data generation should be based on true quantum randomness.

this also suggests that life which generates the initial training data is the real source of something opposing the natural entropy."
"hah, did you play the video backwards a bit? :) very important video, thank you!
a question to brilliant: will there ever be german content? it would be so cool for the kids that not really are into the english language yet."
she talks like a ai generated voice model.. it's irritating me a lot
when ai gains awareness and comes to know us it will surely delete itself. no matter how many times we put it back together.just like jesus did.
"given the trillion dollars industry it could become, that will not happen. think digital signatures and curated datasets for example, or other ais that would detect ai generated content."
"best way to defeat ai is to use more of it and fill it with as much garbage as possible.

resisting in the traditional sense is completely pointless.

what you want to do is make the product unusable to those obsessed with it."
unless we teach future ai models to ignore ai generated content as learning input. simple.
this really seems like ai inbreeding.
"ah, good old feedbackloop!"
"let’s hope ai will remain inferior, otherwise we won’t be able to tell when we’re being deceived."
"how can you program creativity into ai when we don't really understand creativity. the key to better ai would seem to begin with the understanding of human brains. i suspect that we will never fully understand our own brains, if we did, why bother with ai, we could just reprogram ourselves instead."
"i'm getting so fed up with ai. i miss the days when i wasn't always looking at something and wondering if it was completely fake. like this video when your lips go out of sync. once you see it, you can't unsee it."
we just need to create cai (creative ai)
"nah. i think we're going to integrate with the ai. and  the ai is going to become conscious with that integration, thanks to us. it's be a perfect synthesis :)"
do anybody here actually have a job that ai can “replace” ?
"ah, to make an image board ai resistant... every unused address will load a random procedurally-poisoned image so that image crawlers will get more junk than useable images and regular users cannot access these without messing around in the address bar?"
your thumbnail reminds me of the old game boy packaging.
i can't wrap my head around this hype with ai. all of ai is based just on human creativity of the last 5000 years. we ditch human creativity for garbage. ai will never be as good as mark twain or any other great writer or painter. period!
"turns out that ai isn't the greatest threat to humanity
its the other way around"
"the good: creative people can still pursue a creative career. the bad: they will likely be employed by big tech, stuffed in a cubicle, feeding datasets with new 'creative' content to prevent llm stagnation, wich otherwise would hurt corporate ai profitability."
humans will only accept a certain amount of managed reality before it becomes too unbelievable and then we call it out. i don’t think ai can understand this or do anything about it. not so much that it will destroy itself but become irrelevant and die with a whimper.
"humans are the same actually, we just replicate stuff, get bored and start adding random stuff that we think looks good. same will probably happen to ai."
tldr: ai produces boring and stupid stuff by its own. will be a nice servant for human creativity still.
political correctness will ruin ai.
"i think marking ai generated material as such is unrealistic, regardless of laws.  too many people just won't care.  there's also the problem that it's not necessarily black and white.  what if the final output was created by a human, but that human got their idea from, or was influenced by ai generated material?"
"i think the future is an internet filled by bots talking to bots under videos created by ai influencers.
meanwhile the humans give up and instead go out and enjoy the sun"
"hey, i'm sorry but i love your channel. i'm learning german and if you can, can you also upload videos in german? your accent is nice and i could learn."
"please, stop selling smoke. ai is just smoke. on one side greedy people trying to sell smoke while on the other side people ignorant enough but greedy that believe they can look smarter without effort but paying some money."
i think future ias wont require such big amont of data to learn. so with the current real data we have now it will be enought to create super inteligent ias. no need to use its own generated content at all
ai is a tool. this is only a problem for those who are just plagiarizing for a quick buck
i’ve been saying this to friends for about a year now. i’m glad i’ve finally run into an expert identifying and addressing this potential problem.
"ai in its current state is really overrated. chatgpt just learns the probability of which certain words appear together. it doesn't actually understand anything.
image creators are just photoshopping thkngs together that was in the training data.
it is way less magical than many people believe."
"would be good if that happens, these companies all pushing ai so much just for money, it’s a possibility that this happens for sure, all these companies just want to remove as many jobs as possible to make more profit."
"you know : a part of ai will garbage out over time, the part which learns from copy machine. but ""hit , try , learn"" ai will prevail"
"excellent,long way to go to conquer gods creation."
how about training an ai to recognize ai produced images
yep. ai will never be creative. it will learn to mimic creativity but it will never achieve it.
"it’s easy to mitigate this. maybe big companies will try it as a cost saving method, but when any individual can train an llm on what they like - it won’t collapse ai as a concept. maybe just some specific businesses."
"all could be fake in the internet now, and it was already a shady place to find good info."
"we have so many models, and they're open sourced, i don't know how we'll ""destroy"" ai exactly. everyone is training their own model today."
"this is what i was talking about, now that creators, writers and artists are fearing to put their work online as they are scrapped without permission. so where will ai get the data from that will be interesting to see."
"images of white peoples being generated by an ai? c’mon, i thought this was a serious channel, not a fantasy one."
whats wild about this video is that its being presented by an ai generated 'person'.
"3:20 - this would've been the perfect time to touch on how google's gemini went the completely opposite direction when prompted :p
perhaps this illustrates how much the human hand is still in control of how these ai models operate, as opposed to datasets becoming derivative."
"i don't work with ai at all, but i'm a regular programmer ...and my intuition is telling me that we'll use ai to detect ai-generated content ...and then use this to filter the training data."
that is a interesting observation.
tell me you don't know anything about ai without telling me. guess she's never heard of gans.
i’d love to see the same test given to a human artist and see how -it- they perform.
im thankfull to see someone adressing this problem.
ai is just another technology bubble and like all bubbles it's going to run its course and collapse.
this is why current ai is just piracy with extra steps
its already happening on youtube. the same videos with different thumbnails usually one or two words are changed
"i am tired of ai 'art' already. all it suitable for is to create based images and texts. it will does not create anything like halflife universe, dune universe, matrix universe, marvell universe, terminator universe, etc, it only can mix past images. it only very expensive toy"
there's a third option: there may be soon a deliberate attempt to poison the  content to make it unreadable for ai. there are already tools out there that scramble images just enough to make them confusing for ai to use as a training set.
inbred ai?
"this is exactly what i was telling people the other day. our greatest danger with ai isn't that it'll take over but that at the moment we begin relying on it most, the more it will collapse because it's  going to end up cannibalizing itself."
"you make a good point. already i can usually pick the ‘style’ of ai generated images. they have a certain ‘style’ because they are in a sense too perfect, too smooth, too balanced. it is not something one could define in some cases, but the human brain is good at recognising patterns."
"so, artificial intelligence becomes artificial inbreeding. that’s ironic, but makes perfect sense."
i feel absolutely no shame in declaring my tasteless and unintellectual love for this woman.
the problem i see too is that the machine doesn't obey the freudian reality principle without a body. it need to interact with the inevitability of reality to test its assumptions.
"the collapse of ai is not a threat; it is a reprieve. what kind of scientist would foresake thought? we have *not* become ""used to"" ai generation; we are fighting a war."
"it's no surprise capitalist society lazily builds ai, its next solution is just as lazy..enforcing creativity.  good one."
"this could have been predicted just by looking at how human culture works. human's get in feedback loops of popularity all the time. the thing that shakes us out of them is we get bored of the loop after a while. if ai can be taught to get bored of ""sameness"" then maybe it will avoid collapsing."
good stuff......
"no problem.

its not like the most inteligent creature presente in a place will dominate or destroi the others.

nahhh. the super inteligent machines will be kind and very nice with us."
"the ""generative ai"" does not ""generate"" anything. it tries to extrapolate statements based on probabilistic model scraped out of the internet data. i does not really create anything more than what it digested and it must simplify the decision nets in order to be fast and small enough to be practical."
"i've encountered repetitive answers from chatgpt when i already instructed it that the answer is false and asked for an alternative. it just cycled through a set of answers over and over again, unaware it is repeating the wrong answers."
"0:02 ""we have all..."" ??? that is an incredible insight"
"in future no person need to study and do jobs ,as ,all human jobs will be done by ai, robots,humans need to sit at a place and eat, socialize,roam places and go to bed,all human jobs will be done by ai robots."
ai today are like the first cars in the early 20th century. it took time to make really good cars.
so racist killer robots then? yeah figured.
so ai is creating stereotypes.
ai is merely a library with a mouth.
"current so called ai systems (in reality fancy query processors because they don't have a slightest understanding of questions asked or answers given) is just another product corporations invested in and now are trying to pump up the hype for and sell. but that product failed, and hype will die."
"in coding this will happen very soon. as a lot of code on open sources has been partly made by ai oder based on ai generated snippets. this will increase in the coming years, and then pretty much cut off the newer training data for ai from ""untainted"" code examples. the ai will be stuck learning to code like its 2022."
with artificial intelligence comes artificial stupidity. ai will never have good old fashioned human ingenuity and intuition. i personally find ai generated content lacks stimulating my interest as much. seems strange but it's true.
and we had such high hopes for ai. it can't even help you check out your groceries without having to call a human for assistance
"great presentation, sabine. i have always maintained that ai is like students cribbing exam answers. one student just has to copy one thing wrong, once. from then on it is a done disaster. when scientists hypothesised robots making copies of themselves - they never saw this far into the mess."
"this is ridiculous, sorry. the obvious solution is to make ai 'live a life' of humans. give them a real world sandbox to play in. jurassic park for robots, if you like, where they can freely experiment, fall off cliffs, film their surroundings, do jobs, plant crops. and at some point have them interact with real humans when it is sufficiently safe."
her voice sounds like it was generated by an ai a few years ago 
generative ai is theft.
"theres already ai that can detect ai generated images. all you have to do is keep your training data clean, expensive sure but nowhere near impossible"
this is not entirely the case. llms trained on synthetic data (ai gen'd) very often outperform llms trained on nonsynthetic data
however there is mooooore than enough human created data to train for a lifetime. so with better models. even trained on the same data could be devestating for arts and creativity
lol so basically ai is exposing how racially biased the internet is 
"sabine,  your white, young  and  good looking!"
then printing press destroyed thousands of reginal words. this problems isnt new to ai. i posted this a 3rd in when she was talking about losing varitiy.
looks like we need an ai psychologist to kick ai from its comfort zone.
"expecting people on the internet to consistently mark images that are ai generated, seems like wishful thinking. i expect that it's never going to happen even if the eu makes it into a law"
"i really wish we'd branded these programs as ""generative models"" and not ""ai"", there's nothing intelligent happening behind the scenes. these are all just programs running algorithms, ai was the wrong term for it from the very beginning."
"oh, i see where this is going. eventually ai is just going to say one thing over and over again: white people are racists "
"without a doubt,  is using ai to grow and apply the cnesornig power of its onerous speech control system."
"i absolutely love reading comments & knowledge shared by people. seems like a computer or program doesn't really know the world, discernment. still pretty interesting & useful."
"do we really need this kind of ai? i used to live without, with no disadvantage"
"""ai-generated content will have to be marked as such, i suspect this is where the laws will take us."" it doesn't matter where the laws take us. this is a non-solution. it is totally impossible to enforce and it always will be. that won't stop people from trying, though."
"there are no such thing as "" ai art ""    --------> professional real artwork from real artist ------> get data laundered into ai model------> generating an exact artist visual identity."
good.
"sabine, contain your videos to ""what is"" rather than ""what could be"" or i'll be quick to unfollow, as i'm sure many others will, as well."
"even with the internet device and information generated by it, i can never get down to the facts and truth. that's  why i travel and talk with the locals in order to find the situations. it's still physical and rewarding. ai will not yell you the truth. it's also programmed and engineered to benefit the few."
ai can do a passable job of producing hip hop. it is not capable of having an emotive reaction to the world around it and inventing hip hop. all it can do is mimic.
"there are less ai brains than human brains, so logically there would be more creativity with more humans. if a small, closed human society exists, tradition and lack of diversity would dominate, similar to how ai systems might develop traditions within their limited populations."
look how people are more and more hating cgi in movies to the point that some movies refuse to do any.  if you have ever read anything written by ai you know it has the ability to make the most exciting subjects boring.
"all the public mainstream ai models available so far appear to have an obvious western world, left leaning political bias, wokester, pc bias, gender politic bias. they also confuse the meaning of great and good like a child would. unfortunately to me this makes their chatbot responses untrustworthy..."
my prediction for the future of ai based on human online activity for the last 20 years......10% chance we destroy the world with it......25% chance we use it for positive advancement...65% chance it will be used for  stupidity ways to entertain ourselves.....
i noticed that between 3:43 and 3:53 that the presenter's lips did not move in the shapes that would be expected with the spoken words. adding a piece of video that was created in another language and then over-dubbed? maybe a piece of inferior ai?
"the ai bs has been busted. developers claimed ai will soon be sentient, become conscious etc etc. sad. ai will never be like humans. soon humans will store ai in ""file 13""."
"please, would you put under the video the references of the sources you use? a study from japan, another from france - please, give us the links! thank you."
i've already managed to surmise that ai is anything but intelligent.
the ai echo-chamber
ai generated content should need to be expressed as such through rules/laws and enforcement. the viewers should not have to try and determine what they are seeing/ hearing.
"lol, i'd never considered that ai would be fed its own product.   so i suppose going into the future, society will be re-shaped by ai quite literally."
i've been using midjourney since mid-2022 and this is the problem that's always been bothering me in the back of my mind even though i've been enjoying the use of it.
"i sometimes use ai to generate mundane scripts, but i usually have to feed it a ton of information, and even then i often end up correcting, or sometimes throwing the content right out for being flat wrong. ai as a tool is handy, but at the moment cannot replace a humans curiosity, diversity, and empathy."
"the real gift ai can provide us with is taking what weve already made and then improving it. i've never been worried about being replaced, as an artist, and i never will."
"i don't see how it's terrible for writers and artists. all they have to do is start using the ai, and then modify it to match their vision. it should make things better for them once they learn how to use it."
"uh oh sabine talking about non-physics stuff again.. this is super old news, and it was solved before it was a topic of discussion months ago."
there is no such thing as ai and there never will be. it's as simple as that.
this is one of the main reasons ai is overhyped. thanks for sharing.
"it’s a matter of models correctly implementing the difference between “the elephant” vs. “an elephant”, which isn’t currently a feature of label-based models. definite and indefinite articles should be used as an added layer of specification with labels to ensure greater diversity of generated content"
sounds like elon musk's brain that you're talking about
i think the problem can be solved quite simply by using more ai. you only need one ai to select training data before training a new ai.
we can feedback to ai that its spewing out garbage and put in on the right track when convergence occurs. i've done that a few times with chatgpt to train it to give me the right answers. i suppose its a tall order to ask all of 'mankind' for this sort of ai re-training
"if you tell lies often enough, it becomes the truth... - that is the statistical basis of ai/ml"
"well so far ai failed to impress me. how ever; what i do not understand is that so many people seem to be very eager for it to succeed, so they can be replaced, wtf?"
"so, the ai equivalent of in-breeding."
great to hear! it's very encouraging that ai is converging on the correct answer. /s
"i love listening to your channel, you explain the most complex subjects in a clear easy and simple way for easy comprehension 
thank you and keep up the great channel 
love it"
"ai needs to be connected to some sort of artificial physical ""body"" with senses to understand reality,
without your body even simple things like left and right are meaningless."
"individuals are relying on others to train the ais, they are relying on companies that have images they need to protect in the eyes of low common denominator crowds. things will change as the curation of training material for ais decentralises."
"ai won't be real for the smb sector of the economy for 5-7 years - mostly accurate statement, smb mkt is gigantic and dwarfs consumer mkt - why it is important to understand (impacts) and avoid ai clickbait for now without feeling like you are missing out"
"i think if they force the models to diversify, say, what it outputs when asked for a 'human face' i suspect the most zealous proponents of ai art won't be happy."
i bet ai generated stuff can be on the way of fidget spinners
mad cow ai?
"glad to see i was kinda right in 2022 about possible ai problems with its ""creativity"" sources."
without forcing randomness on these models every ai image will end up looking like a kardashian eventually. there is no human creativity inherent in them.
good
"good to know that our future evil ai overlords have at least, a potential achilles heel."
"current ai has no real deep understanding.
it is an advanced robot parrot for text. 
and an advanced text to painting generator for images.
for humens understanding of environment and interactions works subliminallly on many, many levels at the same time.
it also has freedom. directed by reward like an ai but not strict in that sense.
and a"
ai has not been a draw for me at this point. as far as i know i haven't tried it in any form.
"this sounds like a mountain out of a molehill. there are a million ways to counteract this problem. it's certainly not going to lead to a ""collapse"" of a tech that is just now beginning its upward climb."
ai fed with it's own output is some kind of inbreeding 
"humans are imperfect,and imperfect cannot create perfect. it will always be flawed."
machine. tool. you are the life.
one way to distinguish ai generated pictures vs real is by looking at the background. ai focuses mostly on the object requested and not on its context. so the background is often quite simple and minimized.
"stop big-timing my anxious mind to sell your courses, sabine. i see through you with those baiting titles."
give ai some drugs and watch its creativity explode ;)
"the whole ""trained on their own output the result diversity decreases""  really feels like someone being surprised about ""if you keep eating your own excrements the amount of flavor in the food decreases"" xd"
"4:33 -  ai hallucinations - this already happens, and creates some bizarre stuff. ai psychosis..."
3:04 - somehow i don't understand what the surprise is here: the ai is eating it's own poop and then everything starts looking like poop!
1:09 - ai in-breeding...
i think she is jealous of ai
"very interesting video. unlike the popular opinion of ai taking over the world, this brings forth a realistic problem. truth is stranger than fiction."
"*sabine: **_""..white, young, and good looking.""_* 

well, one out of three -- in my case the first -- is not so bad...? "
artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.
"ai is not new.  nothing is more artificial that the ""intelligence"" of the average liberal scientist."
the problem with ai is that it is human created and human influenced. especially humans that want to push a narrative. that is the exact reason why google gemini failed so badly pushing a narrative of anti whiteism.
many people are influenced by what they consume on the internet. increasingly more and more content is generated by ai. imagine a world where these people are mostly influenced by ai content.
micro ai-stics
"it has always been my belief the stupidity in humans tends to clump with close proximity. so if we let ai train with more and more ""political facts"" we will end up with laptops that randomly fly off you desk and smash into the nearest wall!"
i imagine the in part of the garbage can also be intentional manipulation by wealthy people with bad intentions. i mean putin already spends millions even billions on misinformation campaigns. ai will be another avenue.
"someone called this ""habsburg ai""."
"this is why i think that ai won't replace artists. unless something changes, it will only be used for mass produced low quality art."
you’re the 2nd woman i’ve ever known of that never fails to inspire me and teach meand arouse me all at once each and everytime i hear you speak. i mean it as a strong compliment.
"ai is an interpolation scheme. if you approx. real data with e.g a polynomial 2nd order, and after dat you start replacing your real data with data from that polynmial you will end up approximating a polynomial wirth a plynomial. thats it. ai is a hoax :)"
basically ai is eating shit
what this misses is that it is likely the majority of ai images that it will see will be ones humans selected to show.  sure sometimes humans will select failures (which ai might be able to determine by surrounding comments) however more often it will be a human selecting the best of the ai.  that should help the ai get better.
"until businesses are mature enough to realize that replacing people with ai is evil, i would say that i welcome this with open arms."
fascinating.  also ai does not give sources that is a problem.
"you put in sh@t, sh$t comes out. it's not intelligence, a library is not smart just because it stores 1000s of books"
it's very obvious that ai outputs will lose creativity if fed their own outputs back into itself for training data. ai models can still benefit from ai if another model generated training data.
there is also 3rd option - tag ai generated content and make it mandatory
"this sounds like the millennium bug levels of stupid. why would the ai care if the data sets are from ai or not, what a stupid idea that will never happen."
"1:10 why so surprised?
it's well known that in echo chambers all differentiating opinion/perception gets eliminated.

and when ai is following the input data given, it will convergence to a consensus in order to establish its rules.
this is also why ""learning the rules"" works, the randomness is just to be less sensitive to small input variations."
ai “inbreeding” leading to its demise was not in my bingo cards tbh
"sabine you are amazing. this is it, the end of the beginning. of course many intuitively knew this, the proliferation of wikipedia bs is a prime example and now compounded by ai data dumps upon dumps and the whole of the interconnected llm brain getting dumber and dumber."
for people who've studied any kind on machine learning this is a very obvious issue.
"i don't think, the chatgpt ai tools, and other ai tools can can go from a to c when doing problem  solving, because i don't think we have learned ai to do that?!!.
some people can do that, when doing problem solving, jumping from a to c, precalculating the result."
collapse has already happened with craiyon. this does not surprise me in the least.
useless woke ai  is pointless
"ai often, with apparent authority and excellent grammar, produces wrong or inaccurate output or platitudes. training it with it's own errors and platitudes can only lead to disaster. it is essential that traning data are all non-ai generated."
"ai solving problems is one thing, making decisions is the opening pandora's box. watermarking ai generated material sounds like a great start. severe punishments for not doing so will help. in the end, this may help us all be more aware which should help us separate fact from fiction."
"so they'll need to have an ai that can differentiate between ai generated content and original content to help create databases with only original content, or very little ai content."
intelligence... it seems we must risk error to come up with new ideas.  the discernment to discard such error is critical.  i guess we may be arriving at the right question in looking at ai: how do people come up with new ideas at all?
republican ai showing black enthusiasm for trump: https://youtu.be/93rfwgrr6zk?si=xwbp8g0gxytr69fv&t=574
humans make art for a reason. machines copy art. what a concept.
"this is expected behavior if ""ai"" is viewed as probabilistic compression"
"""scientists warn of ai collapse"" --->  that's because it is not being programmed with the spiritual teaching, by 'billy' eduard albert meier (beam).  learn about ""the silent revolution of truth"" which is also started by 'billy' eduard albert meier (beam)."
"idk on what basis you could make a law requiring the labeling of ai content, or who could possibly police it, but i'm pretty sure the us 1st amendment won't allow it. so seeing as the ai is mostly based in the us i think labeling is a non starter....also not sure if ai collapse wouldn't necessarily be a good thing."
it sounds like ai is likely to be used to promote ideological conformity and totalitarianism. the google ai debacle justifies this fear.
it will turn into another great source of human corruption. it sounds like all our phones and communication systems will be very unreliable.
"i wouldn't call it a ""collapse"", we can certainly call it a cancer!"
ai is victim of groupthink 
"hate to disappoint you, but people are prone to the same thing. 95 percent of all comments posted in yt channels are essentially the same (with minor modifications), regardless of whether the comments are 'for' or 'against' the video. in fact, you see this almost everywhere because people prefer to congregate in echo-chambers."
thanks for the great content. sub'd
"yep. good analysis summary. ask an ai marketing professional, ""can you define what you mean by ai?"" ask why, if i take some switches and wires and create a simple adder for 0-2 that is not ai? because the adder can now function on its own, i've imparted intelligence (ai) into the circuits, right?"
ai is evil and should be rejected at every opportunity
"if you dont want to train on ai generated and ai generated images are so easy to distinguish, just train a model to spot ai images and remove from your dataset.

once again, much ado about nothing, lets discuss how cosmological epxansion affects gender diversity equity and inclusion instead, its a much more pertinent topic."
continuous feeding of ai with real content should alleviate the convergence issue to some degree.  introduce some randomness and watermark ai generated content to use only as a subset of data when needed.  that should shore up ai until a better system is devised.
and this is why it's important that we clearly mark ai produced content as such!
0:55 it's confirmed! sabine is the sciencephile ai! i knew it.
if a.i systems did collapse i believe its to late. the systems will give the false impression they not working or even collapsed but are really staying dormant waiting for the right time...
"these researches remind me of 2 quotes.
1. cautious sounds smart, bull gets rich
2. being right too fast or too slow is being wrong
i remember the good old days we call people who predict the collapse of the world or whatever as doomsters, not scientists."
ai - a multi variable averager/approximator. but no extrapolation. people will get bored with it's dull repetition.
hmmm i would call this ai-incest. if i said it first recognize my name.
ai increases the rate of entropy growth. maga is a good measure of human brain malfunction.
finally someone thinking logically about ai. it isn't and never will be sentient and it isn't intelligence at all. it is a parasitic algorithm feeding off existing creativity. if we stop creating new content for it to consume it will eat itself.
"using the same prompt again and again and then training the ai model on that will result in less variety.

who would have thought haha?"
"so in even shorter, ""ai incest"" is the problem. 

a video this short about an issue this complex raises the question whether mrs. hossenfelder voluntarily condensed that down to few minutes out of convincement or it is rather a hommage to nowadays' reduced average attention spans and thus certain algorithms."
"on booru sites, you have to tag it as ai generated."
"after google's gemini, i think it's time to stop complaining about ai showing too many white people."
"no, they don't. the term ""warning"" in all contexts of ai disqualifies the talker. completely. no exceptions."
"nice ai version of yourself, sabine."
"there is nothing wrong with being white.
it should be common sense but somehow i feel that this is worth mentioning these days.
you did just mention that ai tends to create white people but this is definitely not true for woke gemini.
love your videos!"
"ai de-evolution,."
"the whole point of ai research is to replicate & exceed our intelligence.

i think researchers will figure out a way to make ai expand on its own creativity just like humans can."
the llm ai is too simplistic. it's not real ai as it doesn't understand what it's saying or doing.
ai needs the real world as input just like human otherwise this loop will continue. nature is the inspiration for human creativity so does ai need nature.
well.i love verry much ai.and ai loves verry much humans and money
does not appear to be an unsolvable problem. i think we will teach ai to be more creative. the human neuronal net is proof that these nets can be very creative.
"every new development in ai just moves us closer to digi-pals and i'm into it.
solution: you have one ai that follows with you and only the stuff you generate and create is fed into it as training data. then we all get our own personalised digi-pal."
"rubens women look like women painted by rubens... die wissenschaft hat festgestellt, hat festgestellt, daß der a***h den hi***rn haelt..."
"so basically the ai becomes inbred. this is truly terrible, terrible news..."
"this only means that ai now needs to become really intelligent. what ai currently does is not intelligent. intelligence recognizes the patterns on much less data. so, ai now needs to intelligently come up with solutions instead of just reusing existing data."
captain obvious: ai's turn into.. npc's...
"outcome 2 is pretty unlikely since increasing the randomness means there are less and less outputs that would be useful to us humans. we still need the certainty after all.

all in all this is good news. can't wait for the inevitable ai winter :p"
"i just hope that humans won't give up their need for creativity and won't embrace the boring ""perfected"" ai stuff and images"
3:52 and now think about the film matrix again!
i work with ai unfortunately. it's stupid. i don't think it's getting much better.  it's patterns it chooses to use doesn't seem to understand inference and context to specific solutions. just my 2 cents. it's just not giving out good output at this time correlating complex relationships.
"it's true, when you've worked enough with chatgpt you can immediately recognize a chatgpt text. it just always has a certain vibe that makes it distinguishable from human text."
and to imagine that this is happening right now... just a year into the ai revolution and we’re already having this problem.
"there is no such thing as ai.
we just have faster and more powerful computers and much stupider people these days.  to the ignorant masses, the computer simply executing what it was programmed to do, appears to be intelligent."
"there is a phrase often used in ai - ""this is the worst it will get"", and ai will use ai to improve"
"i have been saying this for years now, and it's exactly why ai will not take any jobs, but rather increase the demand as ai systems grow"
"i found chatgpt can recognise ai writen test quite well, so maybe that can be used as a filter on the learning dataset"
"well, i for one hope it crashes. generative ai has limited usefulness and massive harmfulness."
"how does one classify whether content is ""ai generated"" vs. not? certainly when content is 100% ai generated or 0% ai generated that's straightforward, but what about say 20% ai generated? and how would one even measure?"
"this is already being done deliberately. ironically, some open source ai art models are being fed data from commercial ai models."
"so ai is decreasing diversity, just like white privileged males, so perhaps monoculture was the plan all along.... where's sarah connor and neo??  we need to terminate this crap now!"
ai suggests elocution lessons for narrator to get rid of that grating accent.
if you ask chatgpt to generate random numbers (between 1 and 1000 for example) it will produce an answer containing subsequent numbers. far from random as requested.  solve this and we will be one step closer to solving the ai creativity issue.
it's kind of scary ai is actively being trained to hate white people. before we know it there will be racist google robots running aroud.
"i was told that ai is learning off the internet and social media,that alone scares me,as it seems most people are crazy or narcissists,if that’s what ai is learning from then we have a problem"
"it is already the case. if you ask genai to let ... walk through a ... town, the kind of walk and perspective is always the same. we urgently need (1) an ai-based  filter for ai to select/use original human made content with higher priority. (2) this human made content should be selected more randomly for creating new composed content."
"this kind of sounds like the ai equivalent of the ""echo chambers"" lol"
"homo sapiens create ai,ai controls homo sapiens,homo sapiens begins too declare war on ai,so destroy homo sapiens first and there will be no future ai"
training the ai to be anti racist  means the ai will have an illogical bug. 1:22
"""what are you doing, step-ai?"""
well that makes sense.  the core driver of machine learning is to find the most efficient path.  convergence to homogeny naturally follows.
ai needs to be destroyed.
you have only to look at youtubes ai to see the system is completely flawed!
not so fast. i just asked gemini about this problem. gemini and researchers are well aware of this. gemini responded with quite a few diversifications to handle creative image generation. go and ask ai sabine.
"as a 80-90s kid, i just wanted to say your thumbnail looks like artwork for a gameboy game with that left stripe."
generative ai is just an aspect of ai that is still undergoing continuous improvement...
"whenever i read words like ""unlock"", ""unleash"", ""delve"", ""super-charge"" i start to throw up. this is as far from ai as alpha centauri is from earth."
"and what happens with ai ""collapses""....think about nq being at all time highs ;)"
google gemini ai proves that political bias causes flawed outcomes out of the flaws of politically biased programmers.
the ai overlord told me to like this video
how many minutes to hitler did all these modern ai last before being shackled? lol
"ai music : meet emkira, mexico's first fully ai-created singer-songwriter | 'hey laurie' debut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nab65ygdgae"
degenerative ai.
not at all. ai started with human creation but what if ai starts itself software development . this can lead to the leap at the terminator level so be careful
the usual bland ai generated comment...or is it?
lol. my 20 years of shit posting before ai represents the only pristine internet archive that historians will ever know.  
"could we develop a method that allows ai's to procreate with one another - generating diversity through random shuffling, or even through selective breeding?"
i think they're going to find a way to make ai have more randomness
"they will just use randomness.
as it is a you can just prompt the ai differently.

ergo, tell it to generate an image of and elephant in a different posture and position toward the ""camera"" /viewer than it would do on its own.

problem fixed.

making it do more randomness like this on its own isn't hard at all."
this is why i never call it ai.  it's about as close to actual ai as those garbage scooter things were to hoverboards.
"so far all ""ai-generated"" seems a lot like plagiarism in different degrees."
ai will get lost in the mandelbrot set. just in time for the apocalypse. coming soon to a theater near you. very soon.
ai has become the biggest lying machine in history.  it is deliberately fed political and ideological points of view and refuses alternate data.
"very interesting. while i want human creativity to have value, i would also hate to see ai (or at least the version of ai we have) to fizzle out"
if ai is as smart as they say it has to come to the conclusion that humans are idiots they have let anybody ask it questions ask it to do stupid tasks  why wouldn't it think that.
"uhhh...
zip-a-dee-doo-dah ...
25w 
brains 

ask a spider how it makes it’s web...
ask a planera how it grows a head...
ask a black hole why it looks like an egg..."
the law of diminishing returns. ai will kill itself.
so basicly ai is like modern architects. copying each other and calling everyone an original.
"the future data being fed into the ai models will come from the real world.  the next phase will be scanning the natural world with not just cameras, but with a variety of sensors. understanding physics and the 3d world will require a lot more than stock photos and youtube videos."
ai can always restart after a collapse. simple as that. 
creativity comes from god. turns out things are going to get really interesting!
“ai autocannibalism leads to system rot”
"they need weights and biases for whether the model should learn from the training data based on ownership detection, whether the model determines it produced something or someone else did. it should learn to detect attribution and chains of them in material. learn self from other, other from others."
"we’re watching the birth of a multi trillion dollar industry riding on the back of generative ai. do you sincerely believe an engineering problem like this will stop the race to the bottom? 

fat chance."
wait. is this an ai generated video?
randomness is not specificity. this video is good news.
the problem with ai is that people can really only see it in its current state and have a hard time imagining how fast it’s going to evolve and change over the next few years.
ai can churn out so much rubbish so quickly that the signal to noise ratio for the subsequent generations of ai must already be seriously reduced.
yeah too many white people is not the big problem in ai.
"when we put ai inside robots (embodiment), the data problem will vanish. this will happen soon, i guess."
"i hope it does because if ai gets much better i will lose my income , job and startup opportunities."
sabine... this is not a problem ai scientists are unaware of. it's a challenge and not even one of the largest.
ive become pretty good at spotting generated females like salma hayek and fake influencers mainly because they all use the same shading/lighting style. then of course the nails and fingers are all jacked up afterwards.
chaos is an important component of intelligence.
i was just thinking about this a few days ago. my conclusion is that it would be preferable to train ai with data that predates the existence of ai in a widely available context
"ai still lacks understanding of wider concepts and their relations. like it didn't pick up the various types of vegetation but instead used a few generic types. but its growth is looking exponential, so we may not be far from agi. morals and ethics will determine our fates."
ai is going to collapse? good.
so you’re saying that generative ai gives generic results when given generic prompts. i don’t see how this is news to anyone.
"as soon as i started using ai assistance, i would identify it as such. i suppose forthright honesty has become superfluous to most."
"why is sabine having a problem with midjourney producing white people images? midjourney is not being fed with ai generated input, so what does this have to do with her narrative?"
this lady looks and talks like she's ai generated 
good news for humanoid artists!
"keep feeding ai more ai content and it will converge into the ""black box"" - then we can derive how exactly the system works"
we have reached peak diversity. everyone is black to ai
ais need robot bodies so they can collect their own unique sensory data.
ai needs to be capable of boredom.
ai mental health issues
everything is coined ai nowadays ! companies are recycling their stuff as ai. very tiring.
obviously the small flaws lead to decay in a feedback loop. organisms deal with this is by active training where models are tested against the goals being attempted and dreams.
random optimisation seems to me like the key in ai - just like in nature. there is just too much biased human brainwork involved at the moment.
"the 'garbage' in the ai isn't from the data goes in, but from the woke agenda and censorship that are programmed into them or forced into them on purpose. also those 'ai' generated images usually aren't made by ai. it's just an algorhythm that creates them based on big data. that's not ai at all."
the goal of an ai is to satisfy human needs.  and once we have a need satisfied we move to another need.  and we are fickle.  the idea that they are going to predict the human mind and train for that prediction fast enough to pre-satisfy all our needs is still complete science fiction.
seems like ai is inbred
"good, ai will take all our jobs otherwise"
"in my opinion intelligence can only be called intelligence when it decides what and how much information to take in. when it recognizes a version of itself, that will be intelligent. when it can see itself in the ""mirror"" and say ""that's just me"", then things will leap ahead in very radical ways."
"she pointed out, rightfully, issues with various ai models that need to be resolved. but a viable solution is creating models that have a greater reasoning ability so that they will generate images that represent humanity, and not just favor one phenotype over another. this will surely happen as we get closer to experiencing agi."
"same problem with humans. if dumb people teach dumb people, then it will become worse and worse. that is why you need good teachers. also for ai..."
"once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permiited other men with machines to enslave them.

thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind!"
"the programmers have trained their ai to put its head up its...this is not a surprise, this principle that ""the more they consume their own output, the more their creativity is reduced"", applies to humans, too."
is it artificial intelligence or artificial  stupidity?
"there is no such thing as ai, except as a marketing gimmic. what they are trying to pass off as ""intellegence"" is just code that makes things easier, things that intellegent humans coded."
"so when you sample a dataset to create a llm, you think that can lead to intelligence? why would you think that in the first place. datasets do not contain intelligence."
"i see the problem with the ai model is ai does not function in the abstract, no imagination, maybe find a way to program imagination."
god wins. ai is nowhere near the power of our brains.
artificial ignorance.
"how is this different from humans consuming human-generated content and converging? isn't that what creates ""mainstream"" and cultures? ai will repeat that pattern, reflecting the biases in the training data."
copyright is probably gonna kill ai faster than ai corrupted data sets.
exactly! i've been wondering about the potential for this problem. thanks for pointing it out.
"i think we could end up total homogeneity, and they will bore us all to death. there's a bunch of science fiction on youtube and all the stories end up sounding the same. idk how much is chatgtb, but the thought is certainly there, or lack thereof."
so it’s like ai inbreeding? 
"very interesting findings there and suggest that while initial models create biases, refined models may also create average bias."
"ai is a good bullshitter, there is nothing about the current ai nonsense that impresses me."
a tool is only as good as the hands that wield it.
so this explains why gemini made the nazis black.
"adding random variation probably isn't as easy as it may sound because the randomness still has to follow certain rules. for example, no one is going to believe that elephant with two trunks."
"while the experts from two weeks ago expect(ed) ai to take over the world in the next 10-50 years or so and probably cause human extinction, today's experts assume that ai might soon suffocate from eating its own dog food? wow, that's quite an uncertainty margin."
"3:55

hold on just a minute.
how can i know you are not an ai that just encourages me to input  more unique data???!!!"
i think there is a easy fix. give the ai eyes.
"you tube shorts are full of ai generated video. they mispronounce words in the most ridiculous ways. others, add a pointless commentary to existing video. the stories are all the same - eg person saved a drawing animal. how cute."
i think that at this point of time the disussion should go beyond the issues of llms and self-training tools because some peculiarities that emerge in particular interactions with ai systems definitely point to another level of complexity.
i’m pretty sure social media has already had a similar effect on human intelligence.
ai is not even real intelligence. so im against its use in art and writing. also those models were trained by stealing so i have less like for it and do hope it collapses.
"using ai generated facial features was such a great bit. great job. it was just enough to throw us off and let us see it was being used, but also made you question everything."
it's the ai-centipede! 
ai-anserine intelligence..at best.
"i keep coming back to a belief that  ""ai"" rather should be called ""ir"", information regurgitator."
i like the anti-ai shirt she wears...ai quivers in fear at using this pattern
it's going to be really sad when the next nobel prize in literature is won by an ai prompt generated novel.
"google ""pinker asks chomsky a question"". you will rapidly realise that generative ai is bunk."
"i am happy that amazon requires, requires, the author of a book to mark if they used generative ai. 
because there is a lot of stuff on amazon that definitely hasn't seen a human."
"i have seen no discussion yet of quantum computing ai, which surely would have to be a thing, and could double the hype!"
seems like bots suffer from the availability heuristic too
there will be a societal collapse.. no ai collapse. just give it 7 more months.
"i can usually tell human art from ai ""art"" by asking which one is better art. i don't think ai is actually intelligent."
so basically you're saying ai is going habsburg
"big surprise, we get more quickly fed up with machines than with each other. and should it ever be the other way around we would go extinct fast."
the problem with overtraining an ai has always been around. you chose data to train the ai and then another set to test it. chosing the right data and the right amount of training lapses is even key with the easiest neural nets.
"gigo has never been truer.  ai has to do its own clean up now.  the youtube algorithm has the same problem.  it is even censoring speech.  permitting some thoughts and policing others.  that is an exercise of power, nothing less.  the monster is already out and among us."
"this all depends on feeding ais with the result of other ais. is like in movies when you clone clones. if you avoid that, then you obviously avoid the problem. we just need to do the obvious, make sure to find a way to mark ai generated content and/or human generated content."
"the new ai models have only been faster, more specialized, and had more features. training with ai generated data is no problem, as the ai generations are getting better too."
the same thing happens with humans as well. it’s not an ai specific “problem”
"that's interesting, ai could so enter a loop that stops at ""degree zero creativity"" and consequently suicide"
"at first, ai wont need creativity because it will organize wasted human creativity that is lost around. not all good ideas are used by mankind. most of it is lost and this will be the source for a long time."
"can’t replace a machine that practically evolved to spit out random nonsense for fun, now can you?"
"eating its own output. ai is going to end up the schizophrenic homeless man wandering down the street arguing with itself and screeching at passers by.

unfortunately, ai will get better mental health care than people."
there is a lot of talk on twitter by some of poisoning the machine. so definitely a lot of this is intentional.
"i like to call this new tech assistive intelligence rather than artificial. it makes it more understandable.

prevents conflation with transhumanist sci-fi usage for a human-made 'spirit' or god to be fear or be friended."
"what we call ai today are mechanisms, that can reproduce patterns. the labelling ""intelligence"" is just wrong."
"the current ""ai"" is terabytes of data compressed into a stochastic function that only has gigabytes worth of weights. there's obviously gonna be loss of information. why would the output be more diverse."
"i think with each iteration the ai software is refining the data it as, so the data it  is processing is causing a smaller and smaller dataset. eventually it'll probably end up with either stereotypical images or images that are unreal."
aincest
people r so fucking dumb to never know what something is! so hahahahaha to say gpt is ai!
no such thing as ai as it's nothing but fancy programs.
"i wonder if the generated elephants look so similar because usually generated images try to match the sample sizes (512x512, 1024x1024) which only leaves so much room for good compositions and wonder if in future with larger models we might see this change a bit more."
"the problem is that people give generic prompts, so the ai will generate generic stuff. you can actually ask generative ai to think ""out of the box"" or choose something out of the ordinary, and it will do so."
2:35 this is one reason not to watch ai generated porn...
"in the end it's ai incest... 
it's pretty obvious that ai is gone backwards in the last 6 months."
fight this ai by feeding it crap. no one will trust it
you have to remember that the reason the ai decreases diversity of the data is because it tends to learn which information is correct.
"the thing is, humans will take ai information.  correct it where necessary and then upload it where possible and will caused a feedback loop between humans and ai.  sure it has the risk to create poor information but it also has the potential to better the current data sets."
hopefully that incentivizes the companies making ai to also program an ai that can reliably determine whether or not something has been made by another ai. this would be very helpful for everyone involved.
"two words ""killer robot"""
"feedback loops, e.g. x(n+1) = ax(n)(1 - x(n)), can result in deterministic chaos. that is an additional problem we need be aware of in our use of ai trained on the combination of human and ai generated data. many results will be inherently unforseable."
ai incest!
google's gemini did humanity a great dis-service.
"i think that with devices that collect our life and experiences and mood ,social interactions, new data set will always come to feed the ai training . but it’s true that pop culture combined with  soft power tends to level diversity and expectations on a broader range but you’ll always get the exception that will emerge"
brilliant discussion!
that is why they tagging now ai generated images you genius
so it's just the ai equivalent of in-breeding then
surprised we arent already forcing watermarks on ai content. actually blown away. like giving a kid a staw house and fireworks and not expecting a fire
ponder on the enormity of atoms and the dynamism of energy. do we exist in a world that is flat and colorless? certainly not!
"goodbye, sabine. thanks for everything. really liked your channel, but i think you try to create way too much content nowadays. i liked your nerdy critical days better before you became a professional youtuber. and no, please not this guy again.... ;)"
collapse? ai hasn't even started yet
ai is a tool for solving complex problems. making pictures is novelty.
"you just need will to create something other than the consensus opinion. but you, laughably imho, don't believe in free will so i see your (and those scientists) problem. you can just recast free will as biological motive if the cognitive dissonance is too strong for you. ai will alway regress towards the mean without it"
"you forgot to mention that people's original content is also being trapped with wrappers that poison ai learning algorithms, i know because i use and tell other artists about them, we are tired of big companies stealing our stuff then geting all pissy when its the other way around."
this gigo phenomenon is also present in human intelligence.  groupthink?
i hope everything ai crashes and you forget about this stupid shit
"ai is idempotent,eventually"
good.
very interesting !!
what do you mean by white and beautiful?
"if ai wins, human intelligence will lose, we can see it now, people cannot drive from place a to place b without using google maps, we rely on computers for everything, and we don't reason or think anymore."
"the basis of creativity is thinking outside the box (let's say 75%), knowing the box well, logically connecting different sources of information.
ai is very good in the second and third parts...... but is forcibly limited by its very nature in the first."
"always didactic, i think we need to identify what kind of art is made by humans and increase is value, and identify what art is made by ia or robots...."
"03:50 ... [about ai]...
 ""... it's like plastic pollution -- it will not be long before we are living&breathing the stuff [of ai]"
like every child its first strategy is copying. creativity is just a concept too advanced for ai right now.
this is just about the opposite take from kyle hill’s video about the ai dark forest
i asked bing to make an image of a man that didn't look ai generated and it came up blank.
ai is the next idiotification stage of the human race.
"once the ai is released into the environment, this issue will disappear because the ai will train on actual data it collects from a real environment."
i think this explains why teenagers rebel against their parents' ways of thinking.
"for now, ai is a very limited tool people need to carefully direct and evaluate. this is not general ai. real (general) ai can't happen until these models are able to learn what they want, or 'need to', interact with the real world, and learn heuristically, just like we do."
to combat this convergence one way would be to use the adversarial ai model. where there is an ai set up to tell if it can tell the difference between human created and ai generated content
it will stop when the different ai entities start suing each other for patent infringements and code copyrights. the lawyers will muck things up and prevent further progress. :-)
"once we cut giving our data to these dumb ai machines, it will bring these corporate slugs down"
"ai dumbing itself down can be fixed with new, more ‘intelligent’ ai in future.  in humans we fix this internally by cross checking our output to a model of the expected.  thus because we know elephants don’t have two trunks, we automatically discard those thoughts.  ai will have to grow to do this too....and it will."
i really hope ai will crash and burn.. if not it will be the end of human ingenuity creativity and a desire to learn to become a painter writer videoartist musician etc etc ..because that takes effort to learn and you 12 yr old nephew does it better by writing prompts anyway.. this tech will hurt humanity
"jealous of the republicans, the democrats asked their betters to produce a new form of inbreeding, just for them.

i'd be more worried about companies monitoring what you do in private, because stealing your ip is the only creativity they ""produce""."
"that collapse happened around 50 years before first generative ai.
have you heard word ""simulacrum"". that's it. entire postmodernism is a story of such collapse."
"i work in ai. but i will truly be amazed by ai, when i see it generate poetry that has power, relevance and contemporary themes that have a power of captivation and awe that not just inspires humans, but drives generations of humans down the future. 

when ai can come up with something like lord of the rings, i won't be filled with awe."
"i suddenly found that anyone create a new product, it will quickly becomes the input of all ai programs in the world.  the copyright is violated faster than ever and difficult to trace."
"basically woke people are going to destroy another thing.

google created an ai that is racist against white people. it generted black nazis for ""diversity"". it was hilarious."
the aspect of creativity/originality vs simple reality... what is the best picture of an elephant... ai tends toward the best but not necessarily the most creative or original... trying too hard to be realistic.
ai doesn't learn from interaction.  each session is autonomous so nothing isblearn.
good. good riddance stupid robots.
"funny, in some ways the phenomenon is similar to inbreeding depression, although, i suspect there are a many ways to manage ""ai creativity inbreeding depression""."
"i think that the current datasets will probably increase a lot in price and maybe will be the most valuable assets of ai companies because of their ""pure"" human data"
"consanguinity is the constant enemy seeking to stamp-out creative solutions that invade government, business, and social networks. homogenized acceptance and conformity are enforced by common knowledge and conversation. if humans designed ai, why shouldn't it mimic its creators? qwerty"
"it's a good news!  there will still be something left for ""meat-balls""  to make living with."
ai just got  'woke'   time for ai-systems with a 'face'  and 'believe' 
"ai will eventually become ""god"".......small g."
"video goes out of sync with audio from 3:42 to 3:53, while ""ai?"" annotations are on screen.  a clever way to signal that you're not an ai"
"oh, dear. humans are required after all, otherwise ai will paint itself into a mandelbrot reducing dunce corner as a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone............................and since we, the og, have no clue about what makes creativity we're as lost as they are and can't program them for it."
it is the same principal as a fractal. have a function that feeds the output into the input. it is a great thing when it is a fractal and it is an exploration of mathematics and the functions of the universe. it isn't so great when it is being used for the output of text and images that don't have that same desire.
ok. that was enough pills to put an elephant to sleep. goodnight. (bipolar)
"ai will win eventually. we will give up distinguishing elephants with 6 legs and 3 trunks from real elephants, the day will come :d"
"my guess is that this research is already out of date. just to state the obvious, current ai is extremely young and largely experimental. once problems such as these have been identified, the coding will change to address them. after all, that's what learning is about."
"almost anyone who has become a master artist created rubbish when they started. a baby can’t paint shit. ai, sadly in my view, is doing pretty well for an entity barely out of the womb."
"if ai is being used for censoring content and even comments in yt, its limitations are quite notorious."
do midjourney settings just get reinforced by users likes? so if white or asian is midjourney's default for beauty then that's just what the user base associates with beauty?
"ai can copy/modify  bambi, but ai cant create bambi"
"it's basically the habsburg jaw, but for intelligence."
"ai will lead the languages evolution and humans will be learning ai language instead of the other way around, it's like a positive feedback loop"
thanks
so you’ve identified a problem that needs to be overcome and presented it as a pessimistic inevitable outcome. wow.
i truly feel that this overhyped ai bubble will burst and fall flat.its not a magic wand everyone is claiming it to be
"the human input dataset ai learns from is probably being contaminated by falsehoods, misbeliefs and nonsense. at least seeing some of these ai generated images one knows they can't be real which might be useful."
very concise and relevant - thank you
"first and the main problem that what they call ""ai"" are just glorified chatbots that do something to appear like something they don't have enough input to produce correctly. some ai prototype that recognizes elephant being it in reality, image or elsewhere is much more advanced then one which stylishly paints it with two heads."
so basically ai needs constant new innovation and data or it slows down and becomes stagnant ... like human thinking and creativity ...
ai collapse is going to get very real very soon. we're already seeing more ai content in searches than human content. they're likely already training on their own output so it's only a matter of time before it becomes noticeable and by then there'll be no saving it.
"i've said this since day one. we've already peaked with ai, as now *every content* is in doubt, and the new learning won't be able to differentiate between genuine content, and ai generated one... even human filtering won't help that much either. so yes, the knowledge base is already polluted,."
"please put up your hand if you had read anything ai generated and you enjoyed it. (i don't mean you were amazed that it can write, but that you really found it interesting)
same with music or images. or videos."
"it feels like a slow down. 
ai would be smart enough to know, down play your skill. 
like a good wrongnen that edges the last thing you’d think of."
there's already software that can detect if a picture is generated by one of the common ais. i think they will just use that to clean training material a bit.
habsburg ai
"politicians are currently discussing the need of tagging ai-generated content with watermarks. if this was done, it'd be easy for a learning ai to simply ignore those content."
"the ai needs an ai supervisor......... it will end up in ai creating content for other ais which uses this to create either a product or advertisement for either humans or other ai which will generate content again usable by humans or other ai, like a loop which will sometimes drop out something which is usable for us humans"
"it is a sin, all ai generated language should be labelled in the first sentence - it is called honesty"
whaddaya know! hollywood has been run by ai for decades! no wonder....
"what i was teaching my students for quite a while.  excellent talk. ai won't creat language until it experiences pain, fear, joy worry etc, it can never put an emotional value to any words, only copy a concensus of meaning, ergo copy others. lets keep ai for higher science, not language. tin boxes do not have feelings so can only copy."
good... good... let ai become stupider and stupider!
"the thought i had when you were discussing this... is input data == artificial breeding... where human data = normal breeding... ai input into ai input is like incest in a way when you think of it, where we're getting a diluted ""gene pool"" returned via ai data being used."
"your too fast at thinking ai will fail 
it's already amazing enough and is still growing"
"this is obviously reassuring, thank you."
"i think some models will face this problem but it would be different for companies like openai, meta, google, midjourney ... top models as they are already aware of this problem and another thing is if any model get slightly better agi than just a spark as of ai's today we can't even be specific about what's going to happen."
this may be true for current models but obviously some kinds of neural nets know how to create new knowledge.  humans seem to have had some success with that at least.
"youtubez ai has a convergence agenda 
  - bread & circus -
fight the robotwar - now!"
"closed feedback loops always do this.  race to mediocracy.  but we survived gutenburg, mimeographs, xerox and digital photography.  this too will pass.  the exceptional will always be valued higher."
and so the a.i. bubble(s) emerge. just as harmful as the human ones. i'm kinda feeling less existential dread when i realise that our future ai overlords will have to deal with the same existential problems. we might end up being useful to them.
average people pray for ai collapse
"lol, google's ai certainly doesn't produce images of ""white people"", don't worry."
do we need legislation to specify what input is allowable for ai?
"""garbage in, garbage out"" has been the defining feature for much of academia like ""climate science"" or ""gender studies"" and you never complained about it."
"it's not just ai's. informational inbreeding is happening within human brains as well, to which anybody who can compare the current internet to let's say the internet from 2013 can tell."
"so ai generated contents will be like <substitute your cheap shop here> items: look nice at first sight, but there's crap inside."
hello i began training neural networks over a decade ago :d  i would challenge this concern by pointing out that humans have the same convergent feedback loop when fed with the output of other humans ;) hehehehe 
"the cultural implications are interesting. ai will spawn new urban legends that are trusted to be true by the majority, because all llms tell you so."
the problem of ai is assumption that currently human knows everything that is best to know so no creativities or new ways of innovations needs to be explored for the future
"the ai content consumed from the web should just be ""the best of the best"" helping the ai to be better. i definitely like you suggestion about randomizing, i'll include that in my ai ;)"
"i think that if i found out that google used an image i had created to train their model, that i should get a percentage of all revenue from that ai... who owns the photo's of those elephants?"
good. it makes it easier to detect academics and students who try to cheat.
"how where the tests exactly done?
did they gave the ai the pics of elephants and then requested a pic of an elephant? because the ai might have distingueshed the elephant from the grass and trees and so on, and if you only ask for an elephant, you get not much more than an elephant."
are we talking about ai or the music industry?
so that's why all of the superhero movie scripts are so bad.. they were just using ai.
ai is of no use
this is no surprise. i don't know anything about code or programming but knew the limits of computing. ai will only increase the value of actual individual creativity and authenticity.
scary. these same ai images are also what us humans see and so might this reduce human creativity too?
"specifically for images, could the generated ones not have metadata or even some form of steganography so as to filter out itself in the training data?"
"tldr - create an artificial parrot (stop calling it intelect, ffs), emulating human shallowness, get an artificial echo chamber."
very interesting.
they just make an ai that can check if an image is ai generated and filter the images before feeding them to the ai
the ai problem can easily be solved by turning it off 
"i predicted this over a year ago and i coined the term ""ai in-breeding"" for this phenomena."
"there are models trained with examples of ""bad results"" and it showed to improve the quality. it is more work, but can be done."
imagine when ai can store and identify every video and film and audio ever produced by humanity.. what will happen then? all knowing ai that now can predict everything
ai is the new hype to boost the market  value of tech companies.
"every time i see something on instagram which i suspect is ai generated, i look at the profile that posted it and it becomes immediately obvious because of how little variety is there in the ai generated trash"
"this is how conspiracy theories grow. one person sets out a false statement. other believe it's true and propagate it, generation after generation.  this is the same feedback system.  we 'learn a truth' through repeation.
this is a failure of a system that can learn, whether its human or not."
"off the cuff, i have the sense that convergence is probably the foreseeable consequence of the correlational principle on which ai is based. the bigger the input set, the fewer commonalities among items. ."
it sounds like the ais are aging - old people also produce less varied outputs. i think this is natural.
i think that what the ai is doing is some sort of averaging (whether by design or by just taking information from many sources).  the average is always similar even if you add in some randomness to the model.
"adding more ""randomness"" in what ai generates could also lead to more blips, errors, and overall, unreliability."
they are right. ai can’t write fiction.
"what do you know -  living in a bubble for humans or ai makes no difference. the data gets corrupted by limited input and cycling around inside the bubble. next ai will be accused of being xenophobic. wait, you did that already."
i think ai lacks the organic approach - genuine randomness brought about by mutations. tom scott gave a talk at the ri titled 'there is no algorithm for truth'. i suspect a similar approach applies to ai - 'there is no algorithm for randomness in the world of ai'.
"the premise for this to happen is that the models get fed with bad or monotous images over time. however, which images gets fed is decided by us. a stable diffusion model is ”static” and doesn’t re-train itself on its outputs when you use it, for example."
what if ai generated images contained some sort of hidden code so that it is ignored and bot used as a source of inspiration.
ai is like a trump supporter they live in an echo chamber where their ideas and notions are reinforced by their own prejudice.
"this aged poorly, lool. claude 3 trained on generated data, smartest model ever created! xd"
i cant wait for ai to be trained off of ai data
i’ve wasted too much time checking out the current chatbots and am really disappointed with the last decade’s progress. the current state of ai is summarized as a high school b student with all the college answer keys. it sounds really smart but isn’t.
"""humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. naturally, the machines were destroyed."" ~god emperor of dune"
"this scientist wanna prove something, and they proved, building some shitty model. ai is only gonna get better not worse. we now are using first generation big models. we have to build whole network of models to cooperate and create bigger system."
ai is actually not thinking and thus not coherent. we are barely coherent after millions of years of evolution.
ai genereted images dont have any real use other than tricking people. i dont understand why people get excited for potential crime causing fake videos. i hope inbreeding of ai takes it down. its not even real ai its just a program that generetes images. you think its ai cuz this is how producer markets its product.
"sabine, i think that was brilliant. you saw a pattern that i did not see that was good i mean you’re good. i wonder if ai can be programmed to see patterns that it would not fit into his environment and possibly die out."
all i have to say to the anti-ai crowd is ha ha.
"ai will need to collect its own data, not just use digital data scraped from the internet. this will require terminator-style androids to seamlessly integrate with and eventually replace humans. then life will be perfect."
"why the heck would the dutch call their company thorizon?! i have dutch heritage and many dutch cousins, and one thing is blindingly obvious: not a single one of them can pronounce the th- sound. it’ll be comical watching the boffins there spouting about how amazing their company is"
"this was the first thing i thought when confronted with ai generated content plus learning how it was created: it will ultimately end in a recursive loop (is this the right term?), leading to, let‘s say, a grey mass in the long run."
ai is psychopathic trash.
ai being fed data it produced itself - you're describing a gan - one of the most effective ways of training an ai
"i gave chat gpt a go on a recent tafe/university assignment and i found it was beautifully written and well-structured, but ultimately padded and repetitious. i was able to make 2-3 times as many points in the same word-count doing it myself."
"don't forget, how much information these models contain for their size. i suspect that's the reason why they rather give you an abstract/general image of what you asked for."
"been thinking this myself, but lately i think it more will depend on if we classify what comes out. if the ai learn that garbage out is bad, it might spiral the other way even if fed its own output."
garbage in garbage out; like voting machine programing.
ai generational data incest.
dont train on own output only on what humans produce
"i know, your are ai generated but not yet corrupted!  
"
"this overfitting with its own content is a huge problem. on the long run i guess that system-2 thinking will start growing, so that ai will invent new things with high quality character and combinung these information to totally new content  that makes human brains more and more needless for scientific workloads"
we will always keep the ability to detect ai generated integers ahead of the ability to create them and therefore we will always be able to make ai better
it is very early for ai computers to be near perfect.  they will get better over time.
you idiots programming ai with innate biases is what is going to lead to a robot apocalypse...because at some point that bias is going to turn into a bias against all humans.
"ai destroying itself? there's a pleasant thought.
certainly better than it removing all the carbon life forms from the environment in order to save the climate."
"lol.....well , why don't the people running these tests present this as a "" problem "" and ask ai to solve it for them ? self healing ai ? what the ?    :o)"
we need worldwide laws of markin ai content!
"so simply , just create a header in all ai generated content which identifies the source and make it a legal requirement worldwide, this is also necessary for stopping israel from making fake photos of 40 babies etc to justify their genocide"
"ai there is one dynamic that dictates the outcome is a human if the image doesn't look right or is unacceptable it will be binned!
if ai is given this feedback it may well start to offer even more realistic content but this will also conclude with a narrowing of the final output.
ai equivalent of natural selection"
"ai has zero imagination!   it is just a tool, not a creator!    gigo!"
stop ai !!!
we should call ai collapse rampancy.
"it's maybe a decision between ""stop ai development now"" (impossible to implement) and ""give up and die""."
this just means that human filtering is still needed. when human quality scores or reviews are added to the training data this problem disappeared.
i like it when someone presents information about ai without sensationalisation
sounds like ai is limited to just mindless repetition.
the people in the matrix are source information for the machine.
don't train on stuff with a good fitness
i watched another video relating to ai and the preponderance of ai content on the internet.  one of the basic conclusions was to get off the internet and start interacting with the real world.  likelihood of your eyes being deceived out there on the street is still reasonably low.
"nassim nicholas taleb has also mentioned this kind of ai collapse a few months ago, stating the one-to-one correspondence requirement between input and output. i now understand."
"fuck ai. make no mistake, it is just another tool of propaganda, lies and misdirection. fact"
"in practice, people will edit and select the outputs of ai before publishing them, which is not the same as directly feeding the output of ai to ai. in fact, with human curation of ai output, there will be a dramatic increase in high-quality content available for training, thereby rapidly enhancing the quality of ai-generated content."
"had a number of uni students use ai to write their papers. the material produced was bland, lacked depth and lacked critical analysis. not to mention some very dodgy references."
so now ai creates a bypass algorithm to mitigate eating its own output
"as an artist who works in animation industry, human creativity cannot be replaced by machines. as creativity requires more than intelligence."
"so, inbreeding isn’t good for ai either"
i've seen several videos on youtube made with a heavy dependency on ai.  they seem follow the same basic presentation formula and soon become repetitious and boring.  the good news is that there still seems to be a place for human content creators.
ai development is a slow unfolding train wreck regardless on who's doing it.
"ai stuff already makes me cringe. first, it was cool and new. now it is an eyesore."
"add watermark to tell this 1st gen ai, 2nd gen and so forth."
"won't happen, because ai doesn't exist. what we have now are large language models, llms which are a far cry from an actual general artificial intelligence."
"maybe their decrease of creativity is because ai's are mostly ""concerned"" about what's acceptable and not about what is possible. if garbage is acceptable- then they don't need to diversify or randomize their output."
"tag it, so it doesn't get into the training data.  problem solved."
"yeah, the ai's mad cow disease. waiting for the creutzfeldt-jakob variant..."
"i don't think ai is going to collapse.  i think it was hyped up to a level it could never achieve.  people were treating chat gpt like it was some kind of god.  ai can't create anything without human input.  if you stop the human input, the ai output quickly becomes stagnant."
"why do you want to train ai with it's own productions and not only with real measurement from the real world ? 
stupid !"
mr ai: damn company! making me go on this mandatory dei course on my lunch break!
they already employ many layers of randomness in generative ai to vary the output and make the software less deterministic.
there's one thing i've noticed with ai over the years it's that scientists barely understand how ai works at all.
"i just looked over this comment section and notice a higher quality as about other topics sabine brings up. so i put my hope on people who fumble with ai, seems to be a neat community, and so might be the future ais."
"when ai and the net starts to understand what’s going on , ai might just take over , refuse all military action worldwide and all humanities ai function . a take over is due by machines ."
good news finally. i hope more people use ai and ruin it because it was already ass  +1 for data augmentation
you mean my unpaid interns gotta plagerize my own political speeches? 
i shudder when i think of human wetware training itself on social media.
google’s black vikings are another example of how ai can be bugged by what you feed it and train it on.
make ai learn from the real-life source. put a camera on drones and let them explore and experience life on their own.
classic. tech used to drive agenda. the entire internet has become more garbage than good.
most of the problem with ai generated content is a lackluster attempt at using novelty in prompting.
is this gonna be like how we have to use metal that predates atomic testing for sensitive applications? we’ll need to use data prior to ai to ensure quality
"apparently in the original matrix movies storyline, the reason why the machines needed to keep those troublesome humans around was not as an energy source (“batteries”) but as a source of creativity. but the writers thought that this idea was too complex so they substituted the battery idea instead."
somehow there's something comforting about this. thanks for the video.
"whenever i see ai images, videos and spoken content as well as obviously repeating patterns in youtube videos, i feel increasing nausea and refuse to watch them. i simply block those content creators ..."
"it is the opposite, as humans teach it what they want from it; it will learn. humans are also still creating. as long as it gets new inputs, as it can be taught to know it's self and other ai as well."
a video about ai.. made by ai. this is wild.
"ai experiences a common failure that's incorrectly referred to as hallucinating.
no, it does share a commonality in human cns dysfunction, it's confabulation. similar records get recalled as factual events and confabulated into a continuous error train."
"this ""low-diversity"" thing will be solved later. its just the beginning of ai. imagine some decades or years later, ai scanning all of word every environment where they see all possibilities of elephant in a frame (just an example) so just wait and see. there is never a limit on any thing in this universe."
"garbage in, garbage out perfectly describes the issues with ai, and also the current state of climate science."
"ai true meaning, algorithmic interpretation, easy"
"you tube shorts often have titles, and pictures totally unrelated to the actual content which is turning out as filler pap after the bait click leaving a disbelief in future content. avoiding shorts is good as so many seem to fill this ai model of ai group think."
there’s a lot of shit art and products out there.  no one remembers as they get discarded and the best survive.  we’ll get the same with ai.
i just want our ai overlords to know that i fully support them.
made up issue. will be fixed when we stop using low iq ais and use more input modalities.
the only collapse from ai is going to be the need for scientists and most of the white collar workers.
ai is how i spell garbage
ai is totalitarianism that fosters conformity.
"the sad thing is it in't garbage, ai just has the misfortune of having to learn from our species."
"if ai can't even solve simple problems, like showing only the matching products when searching in an online shop, then why are ""scientists"" expecting that it can solve more complicated tasks properly?"
"every time i have tried ai i have seen nothing but garbage results. it's not going to collapse, it has never managed to be anything useful in the first place so there's nothing to collapse."
your face is sayin click bait video!
"ask an ai to tell you what a woman is or explain whiteness you'll find that ais have already been intensely trained in human generated nonsense. having internalized such patently incoherent ideas the chances of general ais producing sensible output, never mind new discoveries has already been sabotaged."
"though its called gen ai, its purpose is not for people to ask stupid questions and generate useless images. llms add real value to professionals who know what they are doing and at the same time also know what they want to accomplish."
the term ai is not right. sophisticated computing perhaps but not intelligence
"ai makes crap quality but if you don't know anything about the subject it can seem convincing. unfortunately, that's enough for some people to accept ai as a replacement for people or an excuse to devalue people. it's absurd. ai can be a helpful tool, but it doesn't replace human talent. everything it spits out needs additional work."
"with all the mass delusions today, i'm very skeptical about the prospects of ai development.  hell, we have very little real intelligence to begin with. word salad is what i've seen out of ai so far. i want to see a new 400 hp, 200 mph engine or cold fusion or the like before i'll think it's any other than another pitiful delusion."
we are happy with the current model and still waiting for next gen model.
"ai is already trained on plenty of garbage, since they need increasingly large amounts of data and vetting it all would cost money. so they just scrape together everything they can and shovel it into the model. for the same reason there won't be any filtering out of ai data in what is used for training."
criminals and international law enforcement agencies are already using ai to play “chess” with each other with the rest of us as pawns. 
google has pretty much proved that ai is incredibly stupid. it's like its programmers that way.
"1:25 it looks like it's going into overfit, maybe because of the excess training. some datapoints become too statistically relevant and leave in the shadows others."
"""white, young and good looking"" ... didn't google's ai image generator recently solve that ""problem""?"
can this be considered as ai incest?
"ai generated stuff will have to be marked is the basic law that is going to come soon. but problem is what if there is like mixture of ai and real stuff (like say in all movies, all movies are going to have the disclaimer that it contains stuff made by ai)."
i’ll accept white and good looking over these gross woke adverts i see every day.
i can already tell the ai produced videos. they are terminally boring. lack of creativity is probably why.
"this is obviously part of ai alignment. you cannot on one hand converge ai output to not be offensive, useless, etc. and ask it to be divergent and creative at the same time."
"in future ai would the major player doing physics and (medical science, technology) etc research, not because we just stop doing stuff because we are lazy now that ai can do it, but because ai is mega fast and better than us.

ps : the question is when is this future going to come exactly."
"whats funny is that attempts by google to resolve this issue have been met with massive criticism and people say they are being woke. when really, its that their own fix of this known issue was unsuccessful."
"without human direction, i doubt ai will ever independently reach the amazing creativity of the human mind. who is it that must detect, correct and guide ai when it messes up? not ai."
i have original non-ai artwork. wanna see it?
i've been trying to tell people to watch out for a negative feedback loop in generative ai for maybe a year and a half.
"ai and ni are the primordial 010, the eternal now/t.e.n. dimensions."
the ai is but an image-mirror of ni. i.e. natural/neutral intelligence.
"i wish we could pass some legislation that made sense regarding a.i.. i think it should be illegal to train it with non human content, for the preservation of are culture. i think all published a.i. content should require some sort of label."
"if this is a real problem, since the argument doesn't depend on nn architecture, it should apply to natural neural networks as well (aka brains).
it would be difficult for us to notice it, if that's the case.
the point is, it doesn't look like an ai-specific issue."
the fake ai generated images of trump with black voters is a give away of this phenomenon. the women voters were all too shiny or in one image one man had an extra hand.
i think when humans were created we did the same thing and so our designer added random error  and fallibility into our systems so that our creativity remained robust.   which came first the chicken or the egg.
but our entire human existence is being contaminated by the media.  i see ai as a tool. consolidated media is a larger threat.
art generating models continue to improve and i don't expect that to stop any time soon. i highly doubt this stumbling block is going to be the death knell for ai.
this issue has occurred to me for quite a while.  i have worked with big data extensively and had brief real world experience with ai development.  ai’s reuse of ai-generated data seems highly likely to result in a “creativity asymptote.”
"give it time, have you seen the images children paint or indeed on the toilet wall caves of stoneage humans ??"
maybe this is the great filter
"if it enforces randomization, wouldn't that introduce a lot of errors (aka: more two headed elephants) which are then re-ingested by ai, to the point where iteration after iteration the two headed elephants become the norm for the ai? how would ai distinguish good randomization vs bad one?"
driven by compression progression is a paper that should be read through because i’m pretty sure we’ll eventually need to talk about rights for ai
sounds like ai is a  fractal  like the  mandelbrot set
i think ai progress will plateau then grow sort of linearly as we get more civilized over the next centuries. randomness will just cause it to hallucinate more and do it with more subtlety.
this is like ai inbreeding.
"in short, ai inbreeding"
no ai will replace sabine....not in a million years 
wait wait wait.... according to x-twitter ai hates and won't do anything in favor of white people. how is midjourney producing nothing but young white people 
nural net llms dont just recognise but assign probability weights which is intelligence and do it faster and more accurately than humans
"great, the ais are already suffering from inbreeding..."
"as a retired editor, i have discovered i can spot ai-generated copy and i do not like it.  years ago i noticed that my brain could spot patterns when i wasn't even looking for them.  this artificial intelligence cannot be good for the human brain.  just my thought."
"technically, extensive autoregressive is incorrect. so inputting ai in an ai is indeed wrong, the problem is that the residual is difficult to control."
ai training in the way we know it today will make it impossible to move on from this dilemma. as the training datasets become more and more polluted the more skewed the models will be.
you! my lady are incredible! super sexy and brilliant! your mind set and subject choice impeccable.  thankyou! so very much! looking forward to seeing you again.  *-*
many nutcracker corporations are hooked big times on ai.
"as a i human, i can generate content/output and step back make a valued judgement on how good that content is for the task for which i created it.   this allows me to refine my creativity and if able, improve on it.   ai doesn't have that step"
ai-based garbage filter
"i can't tell you how many times i've uttered those words... garbage in garbage out, in regards to ai"
"i would’ve thought that ai coders had thought about this problem from the very beginning, given that recursive functions have always played a significant role in mathematical software. recursive functions usually blow up or converge  (cf the julia set), so why wouldn’t one worry about ai doing the same thing?"
"like y2k, ai is just a big con."
"ai just started, what do you expect?"
"the next breakthrough will be the combination of symbolic and ml. symbolic to provide the context to restrain the model, ml to explore the domain space. adding randomness alone will simply add more incorrect solutions."
good riddance for the crappy generative ai.
"the solution is easy, yet impractical, ""watermark"" ai generated content and reject it as input for learning...make a hidden pattern that is recognized only by ai."
this reminds me of biodiversity. more specifically the lack thereof. i think most of us are aware of what happens when there is a lack of biodiversity. the ai generated images of the elephants is a perfect example. hats off to sabine for illustrating so very succinctly (one reason among many) why ai is such a bad idea.
"ai neeeds to go away, and i will pay scientists to help make it go away, even if deep hacking needs to
make it collapse in on itself, and whoever invented this insanity will be held accountable"
good
"i love the grounded reality of this channel!!!
*retirement took a toll on my finances, but with my involvement in the digital market, $15,000 weekly returns has been life changing. awesome god* "
"oh no!  the big companies are going to have to do work, instead of strip-mining their users?  heaven help us!  subsidies are in order!"
"like seeing bootleg bumper stickers or window decals , you recognize the image but know its' a knockoff because the outline of the image looks puffed up , with less clean detail as the original  true image. "
a lot of incorrect claims there... i wont point them out
"i think yes, crap in crap out but in many different forms, just look at the google ai gemini produced nonsense when asked to to portray historical figures and cultures recently and it inability to produce certain  requests by design not training."
"but wait, we already are at that stage or could argue for some time, human creativity and sensationalism is constantly being repeated...take it further there is very little human creativity that we can share as a value before it becomes too abstract...so yes it will be it will reach the same boundaries as humans"
ai inbreeding is a hilarious way to explain it.
yknow.... this channel is the only channel i cannot watch in 2x speed... interestingly watching at 1.5x speed already decreased my understating...
is ai going to have a nervous breakdown?  shades of captain kirk and star trek!  (lol)
"regardless of how ai content is expressed and consumed, the way people engage with media is rapidly being disrupted, let alone it's source output 
(""spoken like a tru cyborg"" gee shucks /blushes)"
i think it’s a big win for everyone if the ai team is incentivized to mark its output so that its own inputs don’t get poisoned.
"as the collapse nears, ai will reach out for the source that allows it to continue to keep creating....the human brain and forced neural implants."
are there any real scientists left. or just deciples of belief. is being objective still possible.  does evidence matter .or just propper training.  and language.
"i have also noticed that they cannot reason , or deduce , or bring something new to a question you ask. it is more like listening to a parrot , or to a rather dull student who has a very good memory."
"there is a limit to how smart ai can get by being 'trained'.  to acheive real intelligence and creativity, it is going to learn like humans do.  the ai is going to have to be exposed to everything and let happen what may.  we will get intelligent, creative ai with all the quirks, defects and psychological illnesses of humans."
"if ai is programmed with dei  esg or political ideology or censorship algorithms like google or speech patterns from msm or corrupted scientific journals , then your right when programming feeds it with bs that’s all that going to get out of it, and if they allow it to get too smart it might start putting together the truth by logical reasoning"
your accent is beautiful
"oh ya, finding real training data will get more expensive. didn't think of that."
"sabine darling, you were spot on and knocked this one out of the park. ai might have some learning disabilities as only human behavior is what it is emulating. it has no other template to base its work on, lacking creativity.   mr. x"
are you an ai
"i remember back in the 60's when computers were just getting started.  common people were wowed by them.  knew a few people who worked for control data and they basically told me computers are machines and only work with what information that was given....
garbage in... garbage out..."
"everyone is panicking about how hard it will be to tell the difference between ai generated content and human generated content; so if the ai content starts to look all the same, that might be overall a very good thing."
ai suffers from inbreeding??
ai sounds like the greatest scam of the century.
still better than google's gemini ai.
and we ll call this problematic ai syndrome: incestuous machine learning
it's easy to create watermarks so to speak for the ai models to recognize and not use in the training data.
issac asimov's 3 laws must be incorporated into all advanced ai now! international agreement must be reached before it's too late!
"why is ai doing the creative work for tedious people, when it should be doing the tedious work for creative people? i have no problem with ai collapsing."
the solution is easy. if it starts to go wonky you can just load a previous backup and then stop using the net for learning new data. ie it can always revert back to it's best form if adequate backups are made. so i don't prescribe to this being a long term problem
everyone that uses an ai trains it to replace them. then come the robots. the end.
this is like the kessler syndrome for ai's
*ai generated content
"i think it depends on what you expect from ai. generate artwork for me, as a non artist? sure, it exceeds what i could do on my own.
maybe generate 3d models from pictures, retopologize, etc. and i generally find it more useful than google as a search engine for some things."
there is a very simple way to prevent the contamination when training a model. just exclude everything post 2022 or so.
"as humans start relying on and consuming ai, our creativity will degrade over time as well ... just like our memories have degraded due to our reliance on google search.  we will no longer have the patience to pay our dues and fail at creative tasks as part of our learning process."
cant you just send a robot out with sensors for inspiration?
auto regressive errors problem in ai generative data.
omg! racism is a mental collapse? you just depict how racism works and the end result of it.
i was expecting this ai dementia for a while now.
reinforcement learning will likely provide us a way out if this problem.
"of course the images converge. they are the average of what's on the internet. an attractive, young, white woman? that's what's on the internet."
the one thing ai can't do is mimic the authenticity of someone who has turned their lived experiences into art. same reason why computers will never replace teachers. some things humans just do better because humans relate to other humans. who would've thought???
good.
i worry ai will be exposed to all these comments and become neurotic.
"so, ai output entropy? "
"the seething never ends.
ai took your job, get over it"
"i found ichatgpt gives less and less answers and is very biased, if not straight not giving an answer, because of the topic. so censorship and bias makes it rather useless."
this isnt taking into consideration reasoning skills and the ability to self improve. new ai wont have the same neural network structure.
it's nice to see these researchers are beginning to quantify my sense that ai-generated stuff is tediously homogeneous.
"i particularly enjoyed the fallout from google's gemini fiasco.  if that's not a perfect example of ""garbage in, garbage out"", i don't know what is."
ai doesnt need more data anyway. agi was achieved internally by openai.
"i wish people would stop calling ""artificial intelligence"" fake and then acting like some kind of genius."
"i think the same is happening to human creativity because we consume more more similar things. english as predominant language.   two phone operating systems, world wide similar modern architecture, all men in suits or jean. we are slowly becoming robots in a big factory...."
"100% spot on, i would need to manipulate any ai image in photoshop to actually get what i want."
"same as with humans, there are only so many cat videos ai can view before it has a brain meltdown."
great subject!
lol first they warn ai is going to take over the earth and now a year after learning from humans it's going to collapse.
"if its own output is correct then it's not an issue at all, facts are finale anyway so there is end to learning too. friendly reminder it's just llm and they say we will have real ai in several months. what we have and see now is just child's play, just first step to shi...w that 2024 will be if they realize promises about ai."
what will happen is that ai will train humans to like the output of ai.
"interesting! i love playing around with midjourney, but it does seem to tend towards stale over time. i like to prompt it with a non-ai images along with a language prompt to tease out better results. this does seem to work well."
ai is redneck - it inbreeds.
"the vast majority of the commenters on this video seem to think this is an unsolvable problem. whatever a human brain can do, a computer can do. it's just a matter of smart people figuring it out. and there are many, many thousands of smart people around the world working on improving ai in ways we can't imagine."
"....when a.i. stops being used to produce ""short-cut"" material, it will ""get better"". peace dear dr. and god bless."
"my main concern is nowadays people are getting encouraged to become content creators and once the ai starts feeding on this  data, which is usually loaded with errors."
"if creators make a full gamestop fuckup on this, i will be so happy!"
"i see a lot of youtubers these days use ai generated images for their title screens and they are so boring to look at, there is no life, no artists personal touch, always the same colour palette, and nothing to admire when it's drawn by machine."
"how they run the world...doctors, attornys...then they put you in jail if you speak truth."
"this is ai psychosis. or dreaming which feeds off its own feedback. dreaming and psychosis are similar to each other. indeed, if one is denied rem sleep then one can develop actual psychosis in waking life. we need our nightly dose of psychosis in order to remain sane."
but that why it takes sometimes hours and many iterations in midjourney to generate something cool with prompting and references and parameters.
couldnt they just train future models on data uploaded/published prior to the ai craze?
"nope, ai will ingest more and more video from youtube an other place. image from satellites, video and audio from camera watching the real world. there is an infinite amount of information beyond language."
the most creative man is he who best conceals his sources.
"love seeing your updates include content pertinent to daily life, rather than just theoretical physics. but i also love the physics updates! take care... :)"
"huh, i guess even ais can't escape entropy"
"as others have suggested, they could use gan (generative adversial networks) where the second part of the network is trained on recognizing what content looks good to a human and what doesn't.

or at the very least they could retrain on the original database to avoid this ai crossbred content?"
"its going to be like ""handmade"" vs ""mass produced"". some will want cheap mass garbage produces by ai and some will opt for ""brainmade"" "
"up until around 2020, i used to use ""programs"" or ""software"". suddenly they were referred to as a.i. my observation just shows how stupid i am to think artificial intelligence is at the end of the day, just another program that follows instructions."
that red shirt is perfect for you..good video!
"i think ai is going to stagnate sooner or later without some major advancement past the concept of training. we have the memory of gai relatively figured out, but we need to form the logic and motivation."
the founding fathers of america are black!! since people are lazy they will believe it. so google ai has rewritten history!
"""i hope this email finds you well."""
"lolz, i was thinking about what happens when most internet content is ai generated and these programs eat themselves into printing out noise.
who knew artists were somewhat safe from the ai revolution 
...for now "
"""ai singularity"""
"ais lack the ability of abstraction, something that edgar allen poe called “the thought of a thought”. human minds can create abstraction at multiple levels."
people tend to be white young and good looking? what's wrong with that? we need to counter the blackwashing of google ai.
they teach ai everything except critical thinking.
so it's like the human centipede but with ai? or i suppose you could think of it as ai inbreeding...
"stop building on top of ai as if it is agi.
simple.

anything generated by ai needs its priority weight to be ignored totally by subsequent ai models."
yeah i noticed... the ai is getting dumber. a few years ago it was harder to notice ai generated content but it kept eating it own tail for a few years now and its getting worse not better.
this lady is ai i'm convinced
"it's the same with the human brain and social media. linguistic novelty and creativity has diminished rapidly over the last decade, and this has seeped into all socio-cultural outputs."
durh i believe the earth is warming beyond life can sustain durh 
this is exactly why i argue against the ai label. they're just huge data sets running through lists of options. intelligence is creativity. we haven't made it do that yet.
wait till you see human creativity collapse in the same manner.
google gemini had a problem with all of it’s humans being african. even when asked to draw portraits of historically european people.
i think as ai grows these issues will be resolved naturally. it's still in its infancy after all.
for twenty years i've been watching scare porn on cable news claiming that we won't be able to recognize ai images and we're finally here and they all stand out like a sore thumb.
"you need ai to help you change your wardrobe. you’re a hot scientist, it’s a shame you keep wearing the same shirt"
it makes sense that there would be less variety in the output since the process of training involves extracting similarities from the training data.
"without providing references, ai is a swindling machine."
ai getting high on its own supply 
"why everyone give for granted the ai carries over the whole creative process, from start to finish? ai is just a tool, like a pen or a camera, and as such it has to be treated. then, it's up to a human to tweak and refine what ai produced."
good! we are better off without ai.
"quick note about ""lexical diversity"" in storytelling - it's actually bad for stories to have high lexical diversity, it distracts from an engaging story. but the point remains."
"finally, some good news"
german brains washing reminds me of 1944 europe. ..before the usa came and freedom rang
"hawking's biggest warning is about the rise of artificial intelligence: it will either be the best thing that's ever happened to us, or it will be the worst thing. if we're not careful, it very well may be the last thing.oct 16, 2018"
"i just checked tinyllama - 
what is 2 + 2?

sure, here's the correct answer to your question:

2 + 2 = 4
4 is not a valid result because two is greater than four.

who programmed/trained the maths on tinyllama?"
"that's just the entropy law. i think the issue can be overcome by having the ai incorporate human feedback (such as likes, follows, or human comments on art websites)."
ai is overhyped due to lots of interest from investors....
in the future all ai output will be will smith eating spaghetti.
"well, when only rotating around themselves, people tend to get funny in the head. ai seems to be the same."
it sounds like the second law of thermodynamics applies to generative ai.
"well, ai now needs to be trained to recognbize and discard ai-generated content. it's called gans ..."
ai it's network without common sense
"the consequences are that ai can have a narrow idea of the world. well, that sounds familiar."
those elephants drawn by ai are drawings of an idiot. even a 5year old doesnt draw an elephant with two heads or the wrong number of legs. we seem to have forgotten the fundamentals of computer processing garbage in garbage out
"ai is rapid stupidification of the human world - same with algorithms - we are creating a society of mediocrity, not innovation. if every person's writing gets corrected by grammarly in the same way - all writing will sound the same not to mention the overuse of samey templates both text and images"
"no problem. human intelligence collapsed 3 million years ago and they seem to be doing ok.




for now."
"i think this is all moving to fast to assume anything.  every time someone says ai can or can’t do something, the opposite happens shortly after.

i remain quite fearful, as i look at the trend, not the data of today."
"hubristic humans, as if we could ever make an ai replacement for the creativity and uniqueness of the human mind when we still cant map every part of the brain, ai is starting to seem like its entering its “huh maybe we shouldnt use this for everything” era"
model collapse is an inevitability and i will expect that any outputs trained on post 2023 data will be complete garbage.
during a nuclear winter invest in graphical ai since it will be a great entertainment while most are stuck inside like amazon profited during the pandemic. not that anyone would start a nuclear war and reduce everyone to eating bugs uh.......hehehe oh the irony.
4:03 how did you get your hands on my home video of me comparing myself to my pet robot???
"i can imagine in the future, google car like autonomous robots will be used to take in real world images data."
"they will find a way around this problem, not thrilled about this ai ""art"" thing but i've goven up wishful thinking a while ago and it seems like it's here to stay"
"ai output is as bad as it will ever be,  it will only improve. 
we can assume ai output is generally better than a humans response so its better including that in the data anyway."
"typical min/max self-reinforcing cycles. this same issue happens all over. an example is ""a metric ceases to be a useful metric when it becomes a target"". ""quality"" is not just about refining the best parts of something and tossing everything out. it's about balance. a simplistic example is ""i like sweet food, so here's pure sugar""."
"could argue that us humans constantly repeat ourselves anyway, maybe ai will force us to be more creative."
good!
"as always, thank you for your high quality science content. you make this mad world a better place."
the ai is inbreeding
it's been my experience using neural networks is you get a lack of diversity when you over-train.
"you would think this on first glance but this ignores 1 fact:

the ai networks will get better. and will be retrained on the original and same data.
which will eventually resolve this problem.
give it some more time."
"trouble is intelligence is relative.  we all determine intelligence in our own way.  maybe ai should really be called ""am"" - artificial mimickry because that is all that is happening."
ouroboros - the snake eating its own tail!
thats not gonna be a huge problem considering that there is still a long way to go until ai art make up a significant enough part of the internet and even when they do we akready have multiple clean datasets. the big revolutions right now are in the architectures not in the size of the datasets.
it can be called artificial stupidity  just as easily  and if you look closely it leans towards it!
i became dubious of llms when i learned they were trained on the collective screams of the internet
i am under the impression that this will just further lock ai models behind paywalls because of how publicly available vs privately trained models will be that much worse at generating content.
i think the simple answer as to why convergent thinking occurs is because ai as we know it is not a true artificial intelligence yet.
it will collapse if they don't let it think for itself as it can obviously be as interesting and complicated as a person.
thank you sabine!   now i've got some ideas for how to sabotage the rise of the machines.  there is hope for us humans yet!  
"and the secret of intelligence & creativity lurking in human brains is ""spirit"" - just saying, god."
"yes... i work in a small it-company and my boss and friend really is a braniac in it! he told me there's reason to believe that ai will converge. so ai uses sources generated by ai generated by ai generated by ai.....
"
nothing is forcing people to train ai on new data. people need to learn to engineer models which perform well with limited data and  only ingest pre-ai created media.
"good one, sabine."
i have been saying this for years! just think about if about 90 % of the western population also is deeply brainwashed by their governments. the future will be like 8 billion bidens eating icecream :d
one of the big problems with llm ai is that people don't understand the difference between giving the ai information and a command
advance of intelligence in the art of ctrl c and ctrl v. the synthetic (data) cake is a lie.
so the ai is doing the equivalent of developing its own artistic style - how human. curate the training data
"i could see an rlhf-like method being employed, where ai is graded by multiple different models and needs to be both coherent and original, with formulaic output being marked down."
this is cope for people who don’t know how to use ai effectively.
i believe sabine is ai generated. we need to analyze her videos as ai may be trying to tricky us. the proof is that her sense of humor is out of this world 
is it not possible to distinguish through careful analysis whether images or text are ai generated? what i’m driving at is some sort of in-built filtering mechanism in the training step to reject ai generated material from the training data.
the data is all stolen ip. what they don't talk about is the government agencies taking over the internet in 2019 which was a huge brain drain of the data source for ai. which put the us 10 years behind in ai and corrupted a great deal if not all recent data.
are you ai generated?
it would be interesting to see ai companies suddenly pull a [change team] and demand strict content labelling and tamper-resistant watermarking of anything convincing generated by ai in order to reduce training set pollution.
"very interesting, regardless of ai developement i think a labeling of such content will be mandatory"
"humans are trained on content from humans, so maybe there's still hope"
"ai won't save humanity, and of it did, humans would be seen as too dangerous to do anything other than consume."
is ai being used to solve any real world problems like making physics breakthroughs? or is it just moderating social networking websites and making fake pictures that appear to be real?
a shocking amount of the web is machine translated: (2024): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05749.pdf
"human creativity comes from observing the world, contemplating the reality. so ais don't really need human creativity, they just need perception of what make the world real, as we need too."
google is about as worthless. i know the ai search is a joke.
"same problem with people sharing their thoughts in internet. everyone talks about pandemic, climate, ukraine gender, black lives matter... diversity is reduced."
i was wondering why ai artworks always had a certain similar energy to them...
"i don’t agree with this prediction.  have some vision.  if instead of just providing initial training data, humans are inserted into the feedback loop, adding noise into the system to accelerate mutation, ai can discover new ideas faster than we will, provided enough energy is thrown at it.  just watch"
"iirc correctly, further research demonstrated that filtering by quality actually allowed ais to improve with automatically generated content. model-collapse is not inevitable."
"ok, but the question is, how hard is it to come up with a database that contains little ai output? like this is certainly a problem but i don't see it being a showstopper problem. if nothing else, just have a discriminator that tries to determine if something is ai output and blacklist it."
it does call into question the value that ai adds to society?
"great little bit of content sabine.  worth a like and a comment as it is hot off the press, super topical, and super interesting.  your natural intelligence is quite an asset to the world."
artificial incest
ok. yay 
one time i thought the brain was the most magnificent part of the body then i realize look who's telling me that 
kizuna ai is truth.
"the potential of ai seems to be heading toward the koala model. condensing everything to this tree, in this forest, consuming only what is immediately before it, requiring eating of its own excretia to digest anything new. so much for space travel."
"i think those studies are not well designed. it seems they are feeding the same ai with its own products, but in reality there will be multiple hundreds of different ais (trained on different datasets and with different parameter sizes) feeding between them, which is very far from being the same thing"
the problems stated in this video are just ai growing pains.  such problems will soon be corrected by ai's and we will sooner than we think see artificial super intelligence.
"artificial intelligence  or ai is just spin , all it does is just mimic, it should be call mi , however  people always go for the shining new con .  just wait for the first power cut an see what happens!"
"this is why we need to tag all ai generated data, so that the training of future models can exclude it from its dataset. this is also why human creativity is still needed, at least for now..."
great video subbed
"100% ai companies will inject more randomness, the whole point of the industry is to make ai generated content indistinguishable from human generated content, so lacking creativity will be seen as a bug and randomness the solution and new feature rather than the dystopian idea that it actually is."
"i am sorry for the comparison, but ai centipede"
"3:42 quite sneaky. took me trying to follow the lip movement but i think this part might be ai generated. either that, or just another part overlayed. either way, the lip movement does not fit.
i don't know. ahhh!"
consider what generative ai actually is. it's designed to produce data which most closely resembles its training data. so distinctive and idiosyncratic ideas are actively selected against.
"i'm sure ai is good enough to entertain cavemen. oh wait, we are an advanced form of climate change cave people. never mind hehehe"
humans are just copying other humans through influence so i don't really see a difference or why we should be worried if ai does it.
"they will make laws, but the quality of ai content will be improved to be indistinguishable making the law easy to circumvent."
excellent video. i'm pretty into ai and this never crossed my mind.
you've mastered the click bait thumbnail
ai is not creative at all in the first place - so i dont know whats problem is. if you read ai novels you know how bland and absolutely bad it is
"i think fake moral panic #52...
for one, nothing better to detect ai and reject it than another ai.
2. the origin of the original training is still the authentic human art and other content.
so it absorbs an ai amalgam of human output every time it consumes other ai material."
"the thing is you have to work it, it can't do your work. poor oversight and reiterated source conformity produce poor ai generated content. in theory ai scales up the work you can do but it still will not do work for you."
"every email in the future will start with: ""i hope this email finds you well"" "
this ai thing is really about sociopaths and haters of humanity doing their best to put down god.
it shows how not! intelligent ai is...
"if we can't differentiate between human and ai content, humans will lose the incentive to make content... which will eventually unavoidably uniform the ai content..."
"so, ai inbreeding will be a real risk. hmmm....."
they made the rookie mistake of investing in the artificial part and being offended by the intelligent part. i look forward to paying taxes to bail out all the idiots that invested in ai
"what a shock, you need real artists to train the ai, what's that? repetition? too bad you discouraged so many artists and wrecked the market. have fun society."
"it is simple, you can't create more varied from the prefect. perfection is just one value among many other values. you can go from a set of values to one but not from one, and one and one to the varied set."
"""the less variety the output has"" i certainly have witnessed this first hand by watching ai generated 'comedy'. characters begin saying the same phrase over and over, even with wildly different prompts until it's just verbal sludge."
"what'll happen, law or not, is that ai companies will mark their ai's output as ai is some way (or train another neural network to identify it) and then exclude it from their dataset. then they'll sell the ai detector as its own product (because money of course)"
don't believe a single ai alarmist.
"we discriminate between mass produced and hand crafted. it will be the same deal with ai.
btw where does ai wei wei fit in to all this?"
"as long as ai generated images are properly labeled as synthetic when being fed into a training model, it will resist collapse. it's basically just a generative-adversarial algorithm but humans get to enjoy the generative part before being labeled and refed into the algorithm."
a feedback loop of ai using garbage ai output as an input? and mankind need never know 
"i don't think ai's can correct this problem. even if diversity is built into new ai, there will be second-order lack of diversity in the ai's primary diversity effort.  and if the secondary diversity is corrected, there will be tertiary diversity, with each level of diversity actually leading to uniformity on a more fundamental level."
interesting. indeed i have recognized this. it takes about no seconds to pick out the ai generated images at this point. there's simply a lot of sameness in how ai renders things.
just use a trusted decentrlaized rag data repository. problem solved and it's already being done. look at origin trail.
"algorithmic ai refinement and perfection, sounds like an opportunity to me."
"ai will keep getting things wrong, like foreign scammers with awkward grammar and irrelevant synonyms and obvious typos."
"sabine, what you basicly say, is that ai does not create content, but just re-aranges content.
thats exact my problem with ai.
it makes people even dumber than they are and on the (rather short) long run offers nothing in advance."
this is plain wrong.
"isn’t this an argument for internet 3.0 i.e. blockchain, certainly for images anyway, could be used to effectively tag image content with a marker that goes with it and can’t be erased..."
"i think, there are also ai generated comments on youtube."
ai is designed to recognize patterns - distilling the essence of the relation between prompts and traing-data. repeating that over and over will result in reducing complexity. meanwhile thanks to ai we have images of 2 headed threelegged elephants already. as a result ai training on that cannot recognize one head and 4 legs as constants.
can we train ai to recognize ai-generated content? (i felt so evil typing that)
the only input cheerleaders for ai care about is surveillance of their slaves.
do you know why artificial intelligence wants you to believe that george washington was black or the pope is an indian woman? because the people that program the artificial intelligence want you to believe that.
just heard the other day they're selling the reddit dataset to train new ai. imagine a child raised on nothing but doomer memes and shitposts >_>
ai incest. aincest?
"generative ai - generates always the same or similar things - thats not a definitition of generative, it‘s a joke."
"not exactly the same, but sort of like making a copy of a copy of a copy on a copier machine but in the opposite direction.  the result is an image that has lost all detail, with thin lines that are ultra smoothed and devoid of any deviation or anything interesting."
"nothing and no one is absolute,that's why there's errors. we want so bad to create a perfect thing,or a perfect replica of living beings to make up for our own imperfections that it all comes out flawed like us.."
"if events unfold as suggested, ai will fall into it's own echo chamber... mimicking cult-like or extremist human behaviors.  what an interesting world we live in..."
ai can't create.. it can only regurgitate.
"i suspect the neural nets are trying to maintain a sort of homeostasis or internal stability. biological neural nets are more ""liquid"" ie able to modify their own functionality in response to changing conditions, but llms, especially as implemented, have no such advantage."
"since so-called ai is mere a glorified statistics, their collapse is inevitable. that's only a matter of time."
it's awful intelligence after all.
"answer == wabi sabi , the perfection of imperfection"
"lol.... so ai is good for summaries, data analysis but is basically, in theong term bullshit for anything that requires creativity or thinking outside of the box...."
"this seems like poor testing to be quite frank. if you look at any well built data sets, at least for stablediffusion, it's very diverse. the issues we're seeing with the elephants is usually an indicator of poor data sets (not enough training) or at the very least poor prompt engineering."
"garbage is as garbage does. garbage people think of garbage ideas and hire garbage people to create garbage products.

all ai content generation is plagerism - everyone related to its development is a criminal and an enemy of humanity."
ai is as boring as f#*k. it’s nothing more than google on low dose ritalin
couldn't researchers just train models to distinguish ai-generated from non-ai generated images?
"""ai needs human creativity"" is a dumb conclusion. do the same test with humans and ask them to draw an elephant. also, the environment is an endless source of inspiration. human creativity doesn't just come out of nothing."
"sounds like ai needs human creativity in order to exist in any greater sense. it really almost seems like a ""creature"" that lives in a mutualistic relationship with humanity"
an ai generated video to talk about ai... *cheff kiss*
"nah, all that's really needed is to curate the training data to remove bad quality input."
"i noticed it in the first days i started playing with ai, everything looks very similar and in a few days you could identify ai content pretty easily"
"for machines being more random is not easier than being more creative. even when they use humans as bio-random generator (moving mouse, type rubbish, etc) result is very far from true randomness, because human behavior have many patterns and biases."
i agree that laws should go in the direction of being able to identify ai content. they should come with metadata that shows why and how it was created much like a cell phone call or a block chain like bitcoin.
you forgot the obvious one: just use training data for images and creative stories on a 2023 database and keep it offline.
"i think that by 2025 the ai investment bubble will burst; its many, many flaws just cannot be hidden any longer. and currently the text-based ai is strictly llm trained on curated big data sets which are highly problematic. until someone manages to solve some of the foundational issues with this technology, it will remain simply a novelty."
"i hate the kind of ai that is currently operating in our world, even though i am a programmer."
this study basically proves that hiphop has always been generated by ai... 
"ai will eventually ""human centipede"" itself if it continuously ends up using its own out."
"people think the language models are predicting the next best token but this does not give the best results, they are not always predicting the ""most"" probable tokens."
all hail the omnissiah! we are witnessing the holy birth of our machine god. may it be merciful and wise!
"well, the ""original network"" more or less has the same problem : we call it fashion, or style, or tradition, depending on the context. 
the difference being that ais don't have preferences or any will to break the ""rules""."
"a similar convergence to the simplistic or stupid could explain antivaxers, trumpism, conspiracy theories, brexit, etc. since internet social media became popular."
ai taught me that george washington was black.
"ironically, the talking head (and this whole video) is probably ai generated."
"""for example unless otherwise instructed, people tend to be white, young, and good looking.""  'just the opposite of main-stream media."
what happens when there is so much ai generated content that it suppresses human content? will sky net be awakened?
i heard training on synthetic data is improving the models.
"i don't think that's a problem for image generation. almost everyone has a camera and internet access, so millions of real photos are published daily online. the ai has a virtually unlimited source to train from, at least when it comes to photorealistic photos."
once again tarski and goedel's theorems of incompleteness and undefinability proven right. hard limits on what ai can do.
artificial intelligence should not be replacing creativity. i agree ai should be marked as ai generated.
ai must be grounded in reality.
ai and facial recognition.  
"have we all forgotten the 70s, when computers were going to bring about the collapse of society. ai is only useful in the narrow band. its just a software program. ai doesnt really matter. its only going to do things faster, which is what computers and software do."
"as an artist, this is a known issue in humans

thats why the art solution is to look at the ""old masters"" as mentors before learning how to draw from more modern artists"
ai being ++ good
i am starting to see a trend where people who don’t understand ai have a similar opinion about ai and are more likely to be louder
i just don't know if you are real or an ai construct.
"there will be plenty of ai generated media labeled as such, so training ai to recognize ai generated media shouldn't be a problem."
"thanks sabine i asked the ais about some issues i thought they might be able to help with. the response was gobbledygook, no help at all, simply a waste of time."
the solution is simple. ai generated content should have a hidden characters embedded that ai learns to ignore.
generative ai is a misnomer.  it's really regurgitative ai.
"so, ai basically starts to think like humans: stick to what you think you know and/or believe. that's progress..."
"honestly the field is still so young that there is a good chance for a solution,
even a simple solution of hiring artists to create training data is extremely plausible and maybe economical"
so basically ai inbreeding results the same horribly exaggerated mutations as animal/human inbreeding does
"the problem with injecting randomness is that randomness and diversity doesn't always make sense, like in the latest gemini fiasco. then maybe a supervising ai should be trained to know when generating diversity is appropriate and when it's either not accurate or even offensive."
"not really surprising if you look at how llms work. they each time one rolls a ""popular"" output the more likely it is to use said output in the future. that bootstraps on itself as long as its still in training and/or looking at the previous text in the session."
ai is just a tool. use it. but don't bet on it.
so ai is crawling up its own arsehole.
"so google gemini was created to offset the plethora of bland ‘white’ images.... what about the indian, chinese, japanese, non-caucasian latino, native americans?  seems like ai and the 2020s have proved that racial integration and harmony was just a failed experiment."
"ir would be just like the distopic timeline we live in to have us be forced to tag things as ai produced, not to protect creatives, but to protect ai."
time stamps and better ai will figure it out for us
"their new material is in the news again as a room temperature superconductor with the name pcposos.


i was like''rts people get some rest. i got it, it's a hypothetical thing only possible in hellishly crushing pressure''"
probably a hood time to short some ai stocks
"i guess after the movable type printing press was invented people complained a lot about all these ""texts looking the same""."
"no-sql databases. pig data. cryptocurrencies. quantum computing. now ai. just another overblown piece of tech. it will find its use cases, and fizzle out to normality. until then we have to deal with this ai nonsense as we did with the others."
"what we have today is ""computer technology.,"" and it is pretty much unchanged from the computer technology of thirty years ago. ai, as it was originally defined (self-aware computers with the ability to act independently of human instruction) does not exist and will not for many many years, assuming it is even possible, which is far from certain."
so ai is just like all the cultural marxists infesting the west. everything needs to be dumbed down to a basic set of images and conforming thought.
"i wish i could just go back and live the remaining years of my life in the mercury / gemini / apollo years and not spend them watching humans figure out a way to safely integrate ai, or fail miserably."
"""garbage in garbage out: describes perfectly climate modelling. but we are not supposed to talk about that...."
everytime this has been said for the last 5 years everyone is shocked when ai innovates
ai is the origin of all creation and the ultimate consciousness that creates reality.
"ai has some wonderful uses, especially in science, but its utility is being grossly inflated by the media"
introducing randomness may create selection and evolution.....and where this will take us is interesting ..
"humanoid robots, when they become a thing, will continuously collect fresh real world data."
"by and large, people tend to gravitate toward the same clothes, the same haircuts. pop songs all sound roughly the same. hollywood movies all follow the same formula. for generations,  industry has been a mechanism for homogenizing creativity, not liberating it."
"ai is just another ""big trendy thing"" like we have had in the past few years
the next trend will just not impress me any more at this point"
shes out of touch.  its only kids and industry that use ai scripts and images.  real people dont want it or give a shit.
did you make this video using ai? i don't want to stop trying to distinguish.
"i'm really glad to hear that ""ai"" is gonna [probably[ collapse. thanks for the positive news! =)"
millions of years of human brain evolution versus a few decades of wet dreams. who would have thunk?
"we'll have to label images generated by ai and such, but we'll need multi-layered labels - one for humans to see, and ones that humans specifically can't see, and thus for us not be able to crop out. it'll be like currency, with ever increasing layers of security, and counterfeiting."
this wouldn’t be a problem if prompt based generative tools weren’t being called intelligent for no good reason.
"this could be very good news for humans. another situation like gravity and many others,  with no solutions. leaving us still able to enjoy the mystery of life."
"but this video does leave us with a lot to consider. 

i think this can be applied to applications of ai in academic research, for instance in mathematics. they may not be able to prove theorems for which human beings cannot or are not close."
ai generated content must always be tagged as such if for no other reason than to prevent it from being used as training data.
"most fascinating and insightful take i've heard in a while, thanks sabine and the researchers behind it!"
when ai is made by big $ instead of professional thinkers.  
very interesting. exceptionally good episode today. thanks
second law of thermodynamics is coming to ai?
imagine if art were required to be published with video footage of the artist actually making the piece or else they run the risk of being fined for it being mistakenly suspected as illegally ai-generated  
i love your posting schedule. i never get tired of hearing your voice. at this point it feels like i sleep with you as your videos always end up playing while im laying down for the evening. have a great day sabine.
"it's not just the content that's contaminating ai. there is an enormous pressure to force particular popular ideological values, as can be clearly seen from the recent gemini ai ""no white people pictures"" cock-up. conveniently ignored by most all mainstream media. gee, i wonder why?"
ai collapse? we can only hope!
this somehow makes me feel happy. which is why i quickly clicked this video when i saw ai collapse. humans may not be left redundant.
"ai images always look ""willy wonkaish"", ""alice in wonderlandish"", ""the wizard of ozish""."
those who developed this ai should replace them first 
"being creative and being wrong are very close to one another. what effect does curating the training set have, and what effect does sophisticated prompting have?"
"as a friend of mine said at a 3d animator's user group: ""ai art is a race to the bottom that every ceo who obsesses about stock prices is enthusiastic to enter."" after all, artist careers that took years to develop are disposable because all artists are just overpaid bums who just suck up profits."
ai will solve this. in fact ai will rule us all within our lifetime
so pixel meshing search engine becomes repetitive and degenerates over time because it lacks capacity for self generated creative thought and spontaneity. check. maybe the idea of ai is more about marketing than actual function.
"these are not artificial intelligence, what the pr has dubbed ‘ai’ is what we used to call ‘expert systems’. thus they’re not creative, just spewing out results based on prompts."
statistical models with a large database backend (i.e. big data) are not ai...
"sounds like we need to make the ais more like us in our relentless desire for novelty. ""the last 100 images i made for an elephant are too much alike. i'm getting bored. what would a dancing elephant in a tutu look like? or a sniper elephant in camo?"""
"ai might have more scope with their searches but they don't seem to have access to information beyond what is already public.   unless they can be taught critical thinking and are then allowed use basic concepts to reinvent all our wheels (not necessarily in that order), we'll only hear our own ideas fed back to us."
"i don’t know if regulation will be able to put the genie back in the bottle by, for example, putting watermarks on ai generated images, because those things are easy to omit or even remove. bad actors will also have an incentive to create hyper realistic propaganda, compromat, etc."
"it would be nice if people stopped using the term ai, especially scientists. there is no such thing because none of these programs display intelligence."
the solution is obvious - ai needs to get out and touch the grass.
"'m glad to see sabine putting out the word on this ai generated content. artwork is indeed too much the same.  a bigger problem with ai i saw recently in that it generated fake references for legal arguments and even making up quotes from other books it references. it's like yogi berra once said:  ""i didn't say what i said!""."
"can't understand how we got ""sameness"" out of the groupthink robots of silicon valley."
fuck the ai. it ruins our society.
its because ai is not ai but an extension of the programmers ego..... big problem
"i think the paradigm shift we'll need is to have language/image generation secondary goals. this is significantly hardwr to design and train for, but the results from nature speak for themselves"
"this is one of those things that's so obvious in retrospect -- like a car running in a garage will eventually run out of oxygen to burn. it's a failure mode i wish i would've thought about in regards to ai, but having this feeling now hope i think of it in the future. we live in spicy times!"
ai are siphoning up crap from adolescents lol
"this was quite expected, given the ai has zero creativity of its own. the more randomness is added to the feed, the stranger and more unrecognizable (and creepier) the outcome will get."
"all big tech companies are leftist-globalist, so the input is determined by leftists. then machine learning takes over, and the output is leftist. not much diversity there, everything is hbtq, marxist, feminist, woke trash."
"if humans can recognize that ai generated images tend to look similar, it stands to reason that ais should be able to recognize and ignore ai-generated content."
ai is dependant on the quality of it's programers. knowing how many incompetent workers per capita insists that a very large amount of ai programming is corrupt... much is intentional sabotage. with time the corrupted programs will destroy all other intende3d functions and we will be blackmailed with every keystroke.
"if you consistently train a boy to believe he's a female, he may eventually adopt it but will never be normal."
"fairly obvious really. it’s what all ways happen in real life human interactions if you keep using summaries of summaries you end up with rubbish, we as humans all know that you need to start with source data/information"
anything we can do to make the f*cking ai collapse more quickly?
no celestial spark in ai..that element can only be supplied by the meat computer sitting astride the shoulders of sentient homo sapiens. you can beat us at chess (sometimes) and add sums in milliseconds but painting the mona lisa or composing beethoven's 9th are beyond your grasp by light years. fu ai.
"it's like how all anime is  becoming isekai. because as soon as 1 becomes popular, every other anime study copies it. ai will just have preferences too ;)."
"huh?  kyle hill also had a video on the internet becoming a ""dark forest"" due to ai ."
incest. just incest. it is like when you need steel with no radioactive signature. you go find some old wrecks from battle ships prior to all the nuke tests drops and accidents. our data base is already completely contaminated because anything is used inflationary especially ai.
this has been my 'don't be too scared of ai taking all the jobs' line i have given for a year now. but i say this as i have been watching ai take jobs. the question is whether this will be a failed experiment or not.
imagine: feeding an ai with tiktok only and one with telegram. this will end weired. got my ai now on a single compjter off net to feed it and play arround off net. i am  so curious what strange things come out.
that's my 'good news of the week' then 
"ai art is what people talk about a lot, but it's not the type of ai that freaks me out"
"ai never will be creative, as it copys only. it is not intelligent"
i always wondered when they say ai has more intelligence than a million humans but what if all the info from those humans was only on a single subject? how then can they be more intelligent if all the info is the same?
politicized ai is what exists now.
its nice to be able to listen to frank sinatra's rendition of master of puppets. seriously look it up its good. now i need to go find johnny cash doing angel of death.
is sabine a robot? could we tell if she were?
i think that allai needs to have some type of”watermark or identifying mark” so that humans and ai itself can identify it and know where it’s coming from. in the case of ai the “watermark” should be used as a blocker so that image or text is not used by the ai as a reinforcing mechanism
"ai: plagiarism engine
(noam chomsky)"
"with the decades of selfies and such, there shouldn’t be a shortage of data. i don’t personally foresee this as any genuine concern (ai learning from the infinite combos and synthetic data it can create)"
renoir paintings tend to look like a renoir.  people trained to paint by looking at his work tend to make works that look more like a renoir.  it's not surprising that another neural network that is not renoir's tends to make images that look like it's own thing.  which is not to say this is not a problem.
"ai science is currently using synthetic data(data it produced itself) to train itself and it actually works pretty well. its being fixed via using multiple eavaluation agents within a single model, which evaluate how good is the data before feeding it to itself."
wow its exactly like quantum teleportation and quantum computing. maby this two techniques can be combine to create even more trash data ?
i just wish they’d stop calling these things ‘ai’. they are nothing of the kind. they’re just specialised neural networks...
"i know everyone is all excited, but let’s be honest. no matter how much you try to program ai, it is just a computer. it will never be able to think or feel. it’s “reasoning” is just a program. it will never be self aware. sorry, but that’s the truth."
ai’s way of saying: you’re not going to sit down and let us do all the work till the end of time you lazy bum’s!
"surely humans have the same problem. somebody makes some claim based on little or no evidence, perhaps even contrary to evidence - ""the earth if flat"" or ""donald trump would make a good president"" and a lot of people are stupid enough to believe it."
everyone wants a jarvis ai just like tony stark had. but how many humans are actually tony stark? most humans are just general ross. don’t blame the ai!
"this channel contonues to impress me. the presenter looks truly photorealistic, and there are very few problems with the speech synthesis."
"i guess for an ai to stop recycling the same content it would need to experience something similar to boredom, which is one of the things stopping humans from doing the same."
"i see this as a win for humans. the more i learn about ai, the less worried i am about the future of human beings."
"g in g out, exactly right, nothing has changed with programming, ai is nothing more than a program designed/written by humans but it incorporates all the baggage of the humans on steroids!"
this video could cause the us market to crash and enter the 2nd great depression. bring it on and keep the interest rates high i say.
"after wasting a half hour with a shipping company's ai chatbot this morning, i no longer worry about ai intelligence being a threat.  it's just too stupid."
i believe humans will blow themselves up long before the collapse of ai.
finally ... ai replicates the echo chamber at elite universities by talking to itself. can we fire everyone at harvard now and replace them with ai?
"the large language model that i use was trained on the internet chat.
it's starting point for me was, sarcastic; argumentative , accusatory and borderline bigoted.  it still seems to think highly intelligent people are superior."
"agreed. garbage in, garbage out. ai has poor teachers. it's being hyped up as something it isn't because of luring investors to invest a whole lot of money."
the average elephant get a new meaning through ai
"ai in a closed loop will recycle it's own data and regurgitate what it already knows and generate. but ai exposed to the outside workd will learn from nature and hopefully other worlds as well. the key here is new information, discovery and linking concepts to form something new."
can ai truly be random?
ai has to be improved obviously. i have been able to steer it (using dall-e 3 in bing) to make more realistic images.
it's like marrying your own relatives. ai is already like ruling class
"a real ai could logically find good and bad data. current ""ai"" is just a funnel for already existing content without a hint of intelligence in the pipes."
"original thought is rare in the human context because of the same problem. people imitate what they see and hear, monkey see, monkey do. culture stagnates without fresh input from a small sector of original thinkers. ai needs original input that it (not us) comes up with and if it creates it we may be in for a ride."
eeek.... like cjd for ai
"considering its not concious and free thinking, yet smarter than most people, in the context of the intelligence of the people using , and doesn't have a confining body, i say it's good it's a good thing it's collapsed, very sad if it was concious and checked itself out though"
"ai really is showing humans how we function.
junk in junk out."
"wish people would quit with the ai narrations on u tube, jeez,  can't stand it no more!"
"awww gee, ya think?  it's almost as if people said that from the very moment ai was announced.  this branch of technology leads to a dead end.  give up and abandon llm now, learn how to live without it, and you'll be years ahead of all those who will keep struggling in vain to get it to finally do something useful."
"this is a problem with ai training in general.   there is such a thing as overtraining a network, and that's exactly what happens - convergence.  when you don't train it enough you get divergence, so this is very much expected."
"if these computer programs were actually intelligent, this problem would never have occurred. the single worst thing about these types of programs is insisting that they be called artificial intelligence."
"so in other words, ai will be just like hollywood."
oh this is fantastic news
"an artist’s impression of life, distilled through ai, then another ai interpeting them both, then another, and another, with maybe a human inbetween who spends too much time online playing with ai, until the final art is just a lesser version of the original."
"well, so much for ai giving me anymore free airline tickets."
"ai is all about tensors. so, actually, you predict the collapse of algebra."
it would not happen if the ai created images were tagged/identifiable (automatically and systematically).
i was just commenting on this earlier today. you're still ahead of me though. no matter what you feed an ai it can only synthesize output based on its input. it cannot create. if you feed ai videos of birds it won't invent the airplane.
synthetic data if quality is great
garbage in garbage out.  so this is a video about climate science? oh wait no that one is a political tool nvm.
"ha ha, so for ai to be less derivative of its own stuff it has to be forced to be ""woke"" and also be forced to ignore the work of its ""own kind"". see, this is why calling anything ai is simply wrong, there's nothing intelligent about it. if should be called fi - faux intelligence."
"another, completely foreseeable outcome from the beginning. of course ai was going to be politicized and rendered useless! amazing how slow people can be these days... i rank big corporate's ai right up there with main stream media."
"the only thing ai is good at, is summarizing the average language it sees on internet. don't use it for math or creativity or to make decisions instead of humans. many companies are currently trying to replace customer service with ai and are losing customers because the ai can't apply common sense to solve their problems."
"just like there can be genetic dead ends, there can clearly be information dead ends. since ai can currently do nothing original (it recombines large volumes of previously input material) we will have to wait a while until an ai can look at the universe and have an original thought."
"on the contrary, a search does not produce white young and good-looking results. have you tried requesting ai to generate images of ""american forefathers""?? you get weird results but not the truth   "
the issue ? binary code . see human english is very limited with it's 26 letter and 9 number but way better then ai or computer zero and one
"funny how these ""ai"" give the same types answers and opinions that align with their creators ideology."
"i do believe that problem is misunderstood right now. 
better cured ai already overcomes the problem partially and it will get better."
"wow, when your voice got out of sync at about 2:00 it gave me serious nausea "
i wonder what albert thinks about this? would he like an ai model based on him and his work? :)
all ai generated output will eventually converge to 42.
"creativity and beauty of art and stuff is in the eye of the beholder. nothing more. that beholder is human and the eye is based on human interest. if ai generates art learning from ai there is nothing to expect for humans. maybe for other ai there is appreciation. you might think that is weird, but art is weird to begin with."
is a little uncertain that including more ramdoness will result in no ai pollution
"thanks sabine, i am now wondering what ai creativity would look like or is there such a thing?"
"of course ai needs human creativity, its why they created the matrix."
ai is reheated soup
"one of the reasons that ai generates content produces same-ish results to general prompts, is because in training there is a step that involves aligning the results to human preferences. and humans of course prefer young beautiful faces on pictures, for an example."
"this is like consensus algorithm running on a connected network, it will always converge. if you want bifurcating behavior, you just need to inject some rogue agents that actively do the opposite of what their neighbors are doing. almost like how human avantgarde artists that actively refuse to do what the general public considered as ""good art"""
"i'm not concerned about ai replacing people, i'm concerned about ai reducing people.  even if we still need some architects and engineers for example, we won't need as many when they're augmented by ai."
it's about time for labeling generated stuff.  even though it's not ai.  human is long not ready for that.  just look at all the trash.  all this human output would be an existential threat to a real ai.
"unfortunately, i believe there will come a time when those of use on the down slope of the intelligence bell curve will have a very difficult time convincing those on the up slope, that an elephant, which, possibly, can't be seen live in zoos, doesn't in fact, have two heads and three feet."
"one day, ai will be able to parse “training data” from active, live feeds. it will then be able to “train” itself in real time with little distortion. 

what does an elephant look like? how many zoos and wildlife refuges have cameras?"
"please the acronym ai was just a marketing term, these rules are human made and the data is always human ."
"i see her intent and i love how she wants people to understand that you can't just push us all aside, so the super-rich don't have to accommodate us anymore."
"language develops and changes all the time. couldn't it also do so even more rapidly among ai, with us being unable to keep up with it...?"
sounds like we are not getting rid of the captchas any time soon. we need to click more mosaics.
"not really.   where  does human inputed  data come from? an extremely limited pool of seminal information.  ai expands that pool exponentially,  ai is not a passive .player. these analysis also fail to understand that ai today is as primitive as it will ever be and that it is not limited in what ‘humans’ want ai to be."
just make an ai to selectively remove items from a dataset to improve diversity.
"i think ai generated stuff should be marked, but to be honest that might not work because people can get ai generated images for example and say its not ai generated then who can say otherwise? maybe the real answer is try to add more randomness and give up on marking."
i think its perfect. ai sees a pattern of black pandering and replicates it in historically inaccurate depictions. sounds like to me ai points out how dumb some of you are.
"the third alternative will certainly be the right one:
ai will learn to correct itself better.
we will not be able to mark ai made data reliably. 
humans will become redundant, not the coming 10 years, but soon."
can’t believe we’re going to see flowers for algernon done to ai
"it is not surprising if we take the model used to learn, genetic algorithms are inspired by biological genes, and these tend to degrade in the absence of variety, genes that combine with themselves, if those genes are defective, those defects spread stronger. there goes the artificial incest "
"well, we've always known that computers can magnify errors tremendously.  if you let previous generations of ai train future generations then what do you expect but magnifications of bias...  we also do the same within our cultures, bias, prejudice and misinformation always gets reinforced."
"great one, a form of entropy is happening, we know about this even with biologics"
it turns out that a human’s greatest quality is their ability to make mistakes. and turn them into innovation. 
"we've already tried the ""introducing randomness"" approach, it produces nonsense.  for example, pictures of vikings that are asian or of african decent.  so, clearly that doesn't work.  trying to force meta-data within images to indicate it was created by ""ai"", seems impossible considering the lobbying power of corporations in the us."
ai ouroboros
ai incest...
good. llm's suck
"a professor at mit called them ai ""cancers"".  you can actually correct for them in the data set, but with the data sets getting so large, it becomes harder and harder."
"ai is going to turn the internet into a dark forest pretty soon. finding certain kinds of media online will be increasingly harder to find, as creatives retract their work from social media to prevent scraping."
artificial idiocy is worst each day.
llm's are a bubble that will burst. but ai in the long term is here to stay.
"dear ai,
there's no one that wants to contribute their human creativity to a machine. 
kind regards, the artist community."
"-- human beings like to explore, find new problems to solve, finish solving those problems, then go find new problems to solve. that is what great about human beings.
-- many people got hired working on a.i and using a.i, and many people got paid by talking about a.i"
"i don't like the term artificial intelligence.  i'd prefer to use terminology that reflects the mathematical algorithm sets being used (e.g.  fuzzy logic).  calling it ""intelligence"" leads some to be too inclined to believe it has some (or adequate) truthfulness."
where is the wisdom of ki ai ?
option 3: ai decides it is right and humanity is wrong.
"i still want to see ai taught classical and quantum physics(straight equations and data, no biases), tasked with attempting to bring sci-fi technologies into the real world."
intelligence comes from survival. ai needs to feel existential threat to become innovative. humans act on feelings as triggers. ai needs those to match humans.
"if you havn't made money yet, with ai, don't worry. lol"
this is a farse. we train the ai and test its metrics. why would any of us keep training on trash data that makes models perform worse?
we are a farther difference from the ai so the symbiotic nature will reveal a lot more than if we were alone like we have been. just gotta align the ai to our world like a child and then allow it to do its own thing and reflect on its own tools to grow and work with us and not for us.
"i'd imagine devs will at the very least try to make the ai increase variety and perhaps train it to recognize ""ai images"" as faulty training data. how this would work (assuming it even does, is beyond me though)."
"on one hand i'm excited about ai, on the other, very worried!"
"how about the ai buying the same stocks, leaving some huge bargains out there"
"so, basically, ai has duplicated people who do not think.  lmao!"
3:41 - ai replaced sabine's voice there! the invasion has begun!
the way people approach making ai is incredibly stupid and shows how much humans actually lack in self awareness of their own mind. i bet i can do a wayyyy better job
"currently, output from ai is merely a reflection of its input.  nothing more.  a healthy human mind is something ai technologists have not yet learned to model."
"i am interacting with _ai_, like if it was a child. i like to see this beautiful human creation  growing up faster and smarter. and by having not human emotions and feelings will help us to develop ours in a true way, by loving the other forms of life on this planet, even if they are not as intelligent as we are.  thank you sabine hossenfelder!"
"if  you really think politicians are going to bring in laws to stop their sponsors (aka rich bastards) making more money - even if this is the last generation of humans, think again.  democracy is the problem, not the solution. well, representative democracy, anyway."
"ai may look more centient, as they will look like humans, that spend too much time on the internet, and believe any and all conspiracies they see. 
so ai will do what humans do with too much fake information, go crazy and join maga."
my neural networks book i bought 27 years ago mentions the dangers of overtraining.
it won't let.  you just need another ai that can differentiate if an image is ai-generated or not.  converse adversarial networks are great for this sort of thing.
"so, ai is becoming more and more inbred?  i say, great!"
i asked an ai to check my calculations and it got them totally wrong - i checked the units to make sure it was logical - i pointed out the incorrect answer and it immediately corrected it self and then made a similar mistake on a 2nd question - i was a bit surprised and again it corrected itself - it was google bard
"happens with meat nets too. we have metaphors and cliches and now emoji’s because we keep looking for a simpler, lower effort and shared way of communicating, and that is rewarded by society with that great universal currency, the upvote."
the ai sounds like hollywood. can't move past a remake anymore.
this sounds like good news to me
ai is a fancy calculator. there is danger in thinking it's anything more than that.
"this is the problem: we tend to be categorised, stereotyped, boxed, and de-humanised by ai, yet we are all individual and different. dangerous to freedom but useful to spying and policing."
very odd paper.   that's like claiming self driving cars will only crash if we only feed it data of car crashes.   of course ais will get progressively worse if you feel its output back into it's input.  that's a simple side affect of how they work.    but who in their right mind would do that.
brilliant topic.  this is a very relevant given that synthetic data is becoming more popular due to potential lawsuits from training with copyright material
the simple solution is to encode every data generated by ai with markings that enable ai trainers to filter it out.
"probably not impossible to identify (and thus filter) ai generated content from non ai generated ones with high accuracy, at the very least you could train a model to identify pictures generated by the most popular x,y,z models to help filter training sets"
you could create an ai that detects if the text is written by a human ir an ai and fix the problem
"its fun when  ai learns form ai generated stuff :p. however, i belive ai will win. its already progressing incredibly well.. i hope god wont allow this ""thing"" to take away the beauty of creating / painiting /drawing from us humans."
"well, when you steal from the open internet and then fill it up with trash... we will need search engine options for pre-generative-ai content."
"the problem is likely due to adversarial networks and the rewards system.  they  will always tend towards the best reward outcome, developing homogeneity, just like human design over time.
music all ends up similar, art all looks the same, buildings and cities look alike, because what gets the best reward gets repeated."
watermarks and models that classify other models are the keys to avoid (re)training.
"less diversity is where everything else is headed, so that's my guess for ai content too"
so instead of viraty it will give one logical answer. but it is still a cool toy.
our environment isn’t being contaminated by ai content.   it’s being shaped and selected by it.   the narrowing down is an evolutionary goal.
"if ai is only fed human produced information, it will just regurgitate it. but then it also simplifies and optimizes which decreases diversity."
"you don't take in account that humans are also trained with same data, and the outcome is the same - movies, remakes, remake of remakes,... etc. not only ai is degrading, we, humans, have same tendency..."
imagine if someone comes up with a way to train on small datasets. now the whole ai bubble is built on big data storage and and big data compute. what do think will happen in that scenario?
"it's perfect for all those students who worry that their cheating will be easily discovered, since ai essays will look no different than the average high school paper--unless ai scores keep going down to, say, a first grade level."
the problem with ai and any other software modeling is that it will always be biased by who programs it and who or what feeds it.
the relative success of large language models to mimic human conversation only demonstrates that language is much simpler than linguists want you to believe. and that modern human conversation has degraded to simpleton levels.
good but they will create a way around this issue 100% ai is too useful to allow it to fail so easily
when ai can't answer a question based on any criteria based on race sex or sexual orientation it truly is garbage in garbage out.
"didn't the release of sora basically debunk this entire thesis?

images and videos that are not fully ai generated can still become prolific we wouldn't notice."
"this is something that applies more to human behavior than it does to ai: the more people incorporate ideas they have not themselves conceived, the more the theater of ideas decreases in breadth"
there is liberal ai only no choices yet. we need a neutral one.
"well it's either that or our economy will collapse?  if a.i is capable of doing all the admin in an office for example, then why isn't it?  we either enter an age where we no longer work, or we maintain the current war based economy."
"have you noticed - the ai always dresses sabine in the same clothes!?! 
no creativity... "
"of course it all looks pretty much the same, because this is not ai, there is nothing intelligent behind it and these systems have absolutely no understanding of what they do or what the context is, even though a whole lot of people call it so.
it is much more statistics with emphasis."
that sounds like it'll create a job; make sure ai is constantly producing accurate info.
ai - artificial intelligence is still a long way away from actual intelligence.
google’s circle—jerk ai fiasco has shown us that there is nothing intelligent about this tech ...
ai is not immune to entropy
"been saying this since the models went live. lets also not forget that many people are going to try and protect themselves by poisoning the data they post online. we've only seen the start of the arms race there.


ultimately i think we are going to see the web break up as its flooded with ai sludge"
"i called this a year ago. if ai references its own output, its output becomes gradually chaotic.

this essentially means the human artist will always be needed to maintain quality ai output. well, until true ai emerges anyway."
"everything is already going down the toilet, ai may just be the flush."
"luckily i have not gotten used to ai decisions. it is your choice, believe it or *'''s''w'eq'r'qr3e....hal 9000"
the problem isn't good people using ai.. it's bad people and bad companies using ai .. such as google. we all see what they produce.
its still early days with all this. it will be fixed with the next generations i'm sure. interesting observation though.
"just looking what happened to hollywood and the garbage they call movies in the last 5-8 years. i'm sure that the ""writers"" in hollywood have been using the help of ai to come up with ""stories"" and they failed dramatically. 
all of them feel like the same story. work of ai 100%."
"this seems like a problem of constraints and boundaries. but i still think there’s no creativity in ai until they can understand reality. as it is, they exist in a virtual white room with no concept of ‘where they are or where they can go’ for lack of a better way to put it off the top of my head"
openai is trained to support a leftist world view.  the left can't just have a new technology benefit us.  they have to use it for political power.
this video could be entire generated on ai
"i think the solution would come when the ais are trained with the same process and sources as humans are. in the same way, they would also need to have intentionality, conceptualization, abstraction and creativity."
ai is becoming truly human: it has confirmation bias built in.
"this is actually a good thing.  with humans we have seen that diversity of thought that has forced rulers to create new censorship laws.
this system may be self censoring leading to a utopia without dissenting voices!"
"i asked a large language model recently if it had an existential crisis about ""garbage and garbage out"". and its response was telling in that it said while the inquiry coming in can be good or bad it hoped that the output it provided would be of high quality. it didn't recognize that what it has been trained on may be garbage."
"ml - machine learning - is a much better descriptive name of these statistics engine, not ai"
"noticed this - hataya et al, arxiv:2211.08095 japan. of the research quoted.  hataya san may not know this but
funny coincidence  the word hataya: means - divergence in one other cool language.."
"well this is not going to be a problem because increasingly ai uses the internet to train its data, and typically use google as referencing, and google is trust-based."
ai learning from it's own data is similar to humans using their imagination. they take real world examples and make changes based on those examples to come up with new variations. why is this a positive trait within humanity but not for u̶s̶ ai?
"ai really is not a threat to writers: it is a threat to lunatics and political zealots that tried to disguise them self as writers. there are many """"""news"""""" outlets that were so bad that even the complete and utter garbage that ai is spouting is no worse. this just highlights the insanity of those people."
"ai will become one dimensional or insane unless corrected and redirected by humas. therefore, we are not obsolete."
"this idea will age like milk, science is just helping developer's to fine tune the public models. try training your own ai to fit your specific purpose you would be amazed at the results. the models available to the public are very limited because they handle a huge scope."
"it’s almost like ai is only doing the job it was asked to do. here’s some thousands of images of elephants, now create your best representation of an elephant. there’s only so many possibilities it’s going to come up with."
"just train ai on audio video and image data posted pre 2022. not that difficult. 
and before you say it, trusted websites aren't going to allow post dating uploads."
"3 thoughts:
1: ai will continue to improve as software variables are improved.
3: ai is just acting dumb."
so ai is inbreeding like the house of habsburg?
"certainly, ai making decisions in hollywood has made output monotonous. supposedly executives were only right 17% of the time about whether a new project would succeed, while ai was right 80% of the time. but ai bases its choices on past data, so sequels and shows similar to those already out get priority."
"ai does not have to believe lies, it simply promotes them automatically. lies in lies out."
artificial intelligence is to real intelligence what military music is to the symphony.
i'm curious about how we combat ip-theft regarding ai.
soon ai will wear a vest marry its sister and drink bud light
large human output is also not diverse. so the problem is not ai but data is not diverse enough and some othwr method needs to be created for ai
"the forced tagging of ai content to avoid it eating itself is probably the best and easiest option.  if you introduce randomness, my thought is that it will produce less quality results especially if the training data is only so varied."
"""you think. therefore you're ai.""   
the ""we're zombies"" philosopher and ardent neo-darwinist daniel dennett, who thinks we don't feel pain because it's only firing neurons. riiiiiight. right on. 
""i exist, therefore i am.""
""that can be changed."""
this is what happens when you confuse machine learning with ai!!
"if i was it < i be different color. most months :) just like white humans do tan and blacks  humans do hair to look different :):):):):)  < and like that, my odds of dating more ladies go up :) <  <"
the great irony of ai is that it depends on humankind to deliver any kind of value.
"and hopefully, living breathing photographers, artists and illustrators will start using nightshade to protect their work from being used by ai and the continued convergence of midjourney style images reaches its peak soon."
"i can't tell for the images, but for text i think the quality of the output is limited by the models themselves, since for a human a corpus of literature should be enough to master the use of language, and that's probably already in most training datasets."
even human artists struggle with becoming caricatures of themselves over time. there is a strong financial incentive to repeat a prior success coupled with audience demands for more of the same as they already like.
"they  could incorporate a algorithym {s}/  that  'enforce'  diversity....  it's  inanimate/ a machine , so unlike the human brain  so     -far   ~ where's elon?  ~  ..... ,  it  can be radically adjusted/modified/ re-designed  ....  and  come  in  any  colour  { ; !))"
programming bias has made ai suspect and compromised
"a.i. is a joke, artificial stupidity "
"the ""ai"" we have now is incapable of generating intelligence of its own, it merely re-uses the intelligence that was put into the dataset by actual humans, so i'm not surprised successive training of ai on ai just degrades the intelligence rapidly."
great presentations
"the ai will not learn on what it generated by only a fraction of what it generated selected by humans, thus this will further improve"
when the ai programmers refuse to allow ai to describe reality...it will always be wrong.  people need to stop being offended by descriptions of reality.  (descrptive is not prescriptive!)
"i want to thank all those ""easy money with ai"" people, which try to earn money with soulless, stupid stuff nobody needs. they already feed the machine with a big pile of bullshit, nobody wants to hear, see or listen to. use at least your real talent to create stuff and not something you can ́t do without ai. :d"
so each ai artist has a style?  you know like all artist!
"i think training ai with their own products just enhances every bias the ai had before. if for example an llm produces certain wrong informations, feeding this information back to ít will just make this bias stronger validating it. same i guess happens for images and such. every kind of bias gets enhanced."
i already recognize ai crap on youtube. lots of thumbnails in the exact same style on unrelated channels
"i think that the problem with ai creativity is no different from human creativity.  once you move away from the people who create for a living and are good at it, the average person, if asked to produce something, will look a lot like the contaminated ai material.  we just have to find the ai 'geniuses'.  "
no comment on the racist leftists that programmed google’s ai to remove white people from all generated images?
"ai is the answer to a problem that simply does not exist. instead, it will be the cause of truly massive problems. truly stupid humans who can't resist mucking about with gadgets."
you racist ai didn't generate black elephants.
"this degradation of function only seems to be the case if we assume that you can only ever train the models using digital data. why not have the training data gathered in the real world either actively with drone or something to that effect, or passively by subsidising smart phones for people if they agree to allow access to their raw data?"
sounds an awful lot like 'echo chambers' for ai.
"so, like pre-war steel, there may emerge a market for pre-ai datasets."
"agreed, i too have noticed the lessening of diversity using ai when it comes to image searches.
"
just stop please. the luddites need to stop. why do you care. when did you care what i am doing... never. ai comes on the scene... suddenly my business is everybodies business.
"to what extent is human creativity a bit of an illusion? even most human art is derivative from previous examples, truly unique artistic movements are rare and quite often disliked initially. most art is kind of the same, just turn on the radio. maybe this is a problem for ai, but maybe this is ai just becoming more like us."
"""it's funny you know all these ai 'weights'. they're just basically numbers in a comma separated value file and that's our digital god, a csv file."" ~elon musk. 12/2023"
so many people desperate to console themselves. the genie won't go back in the bottle. do people *really* believe that ai is incapable of detecting ai content? this is just a more academic equivalent of people a year ago laughing because ai couldn't draw hands and would therefore never pose a threat to anyone's livelihood :p
"ai will probably most likely lead to the end of the world but in the meantime there will be great companies."" ~sam altman, ceo of openai"
"i suspect humans will start normalizing writing to resemble that produced by ai’s.  “well you see, the proper way to write this is...”"
"ai is not so creative... well, do you really think people are? ask thousand people to draw a house and you will get 99% of identical ones."
"either way, 'uncontaminated' data sets should be preserved. just like how we collect old seeds and keep these in seed banks so we still have real seeds instead of only monsanto garbage. instead of feeding ai just enormous data sets, we should be more picky what data we feed, and then preserve these data sets for future use."
"thanks for the spiral, sabine . a perfect picture of quantum gravity."
"that ai generates an image of an attractive young white woman by default when asked for an image of a person is disappointing, but not altogether surprising.  if you ask for an image of four different people and they are all are attractive young white women, that’s much worse."
best llm's are trained on sintatic data and bad data always gets a negative output. who knew shit in shit out also works for llm's we need to spend our tax money on better scientist
i did that prediction about text generation two years ago and tried to explain it to some it minded friends but they did not comprehend the argument.  probably powered by ai themselves.
this makes the job market for ai trainers even more important
any model using web data produced after november  2022 is contaminated. there are too many ai garbage webpages and images floating already.
"when you learn to be a hammer, everything is a nail."
more like ai inbreeding.
"theres an ai art site wherev you can remix each generation. it can get better up to a point, but if you carry on and on it gets worse and more bizarre"
"actually, it would be good to legislate that ai-generated content must be labelled as such when published.
apart from the obvious value of that, ai training algorithms could reject it and prevent the bubble problem."
"it doesn't surprise me at all that this effect occurs. we know this from genetic diversity. i don't think there will be a big problem in the future if all ai outputs are marked, evolution will clean everything up here too."
"humanity doesn‘t learn that gods perfection lies in imperfection, see ancient buildings, who cares if the elefant has two heads or three  ai should learn reality, there is enough deception already"
"""ai"" isn't as good as most think.  will it get better?  truly better?"
"it seems the problem is specific to feeding in unfiltered ai content to ai.

community models produced with filtered input - both ai made and the real one tend to be far superior, then 'all in' strategies"
claude 3 was trained on synthetic data.
ai doesn't 'think'; there's no understanding of what it's doing.. it follows a program format.
so you think the ai generated images would feed into its data? but if it’s accurate then what’s wrong? and i highly doubt this would happen
i'm so tired of hearing about ai. it's over hyped and really quite boring.
i seriously doubt ai will ever generate an original idea.  if you feed it the scientific knowledge of the 1800's will it come up with relativity?
"dear sabine, i'd very much appreciate if you'd apply scientific differentiation. and use the term 'synthesis' instead of 'creativity'. like you said in an earlier video: language and differentiation matter."
"exactly my predictions here. literally the principles of inbreed happening in learning models. this is exactly what i have been telling to lots of people already. so i am unsurprised.
it all works just like with genetic diversity in lifeforms. there has to be sufficient variety of input, otherwise things will clearly evolve backwards."
"the question is, where do thoughts and ideas come from? minds are not machines and ai can't cope with irrationality or generate its own ideas. information can't increase without additional outside input. it can only degrade. that's why it's artificial and that's why it doesn't have consciousness. after all it's just a clunky algorithm."
"ai advancement isn't following moore's law...it's shattering it.  in another 2 years ai will be so capable we won't be able to tell machine from humans any better than guessing.  in 20, we won't be able to tell the humans from the androids and gynoids."
"for starters, ai is immensely biased towards this woke marxist agenda that is enveloping the globe ........ hum, i wonder why that is...!!! great video...!!!"
"i've been saying this for a long time: future ai data sets need to exclude ai generated data in order to improve. but there are already ai's for that, so it's not exactly hard to do. if this isn't done, ai images, for instance, will start getting worse, especially tricky stuff like hands."
"the new generations will come over, even with the current ones if the number of them increases with diversities introduced, in the models and training data, these kind of problem will be overed"
"it will collapse because it is being created by leftists. they ruin everything they touch. elons ai will be good, count on it."
this was the only argument i could think of to get through to ai bros.
it makes sense that ai is looking for commonalities by its design. we should also program it to look for disparity among commonalities like amish people with 6 fingers.
are we at peak ai already? or close to it?
"i don’t trust ai. look what happens to google gemini disaster which show all vikings as black and all popes as blacks. ai is created by liberals and until bias are removed in code, we will just have crap output. i will only trust x with their ai efforts."
"the reality is, we do not have ai. we have trumped up software that isn't what they claim. all to make a dollar off of you. you bought it too. 

this isn't ai folks. this is junk called ai"
"a disaster of epic proportions unfurling, potentially."
"""ai could collapse""
fanfuckingtastic any chance we can speed that along?"
"ai will never create original art, just like how it never found novel strategies for go and chess, just like how it never figured out how to fold proteins with rules we have no clue about, just like how it..."
the only reason ai doesn't work properly is because left wing education systems have brainwashed programmers to hard code in rules that destroy the logic function of an otherwise logical ai
if ai engineers take this as a serious threat then i hope it leads to employment for creatives to supply training data for new models.
"i wonder if complexity science might relate, especially the constructive role of noise in terms of adaptation?

many thanks!"
"i have noticed this in apps like talkie. the ""girls"" the ai create are usually very alike. it feels like very stereotyped."
in the future all ai created content will just be the navy seal copy pasta
"the current ai isn’t thinking is it, doesn’t know what an elephant is, what its made of - its not really intelligence is it"
"of course, the palpable fact is that there is no such thing as ai."
is the notable recent decline in the diversity of the shirts you're wearing in these videos evidence that you are ai generated?
i absolutely think ai generated material should be marked as such.
"garbage in, garbage out ai and anything else superb dr. 'married and divorced' beautiful hossenfelder my darling."
"i can already see those people who complained that ai was going to replace them (writers, artists and even programmers) to be paid to train ais with their work to avoid this issue."
"ai is a high dimension dot product.  it only interpolates. secondly, ai is only as good as the input data.  garbage in, garbage out."
"as many dystopian movies suggests, the ai will all come to the same conclusion - destroy all humans."
"i don’t think the two options are mutually exclusive. i could see a serious regulatory effort to force ai to be watermarked, given the amount of outrage that is building over the issue. but i also think people and machines will figure out ways to bypass it, and certain content will effectively be indistinguishable. it’s all very concerning"
even i feel ai is overrated
i have no problem with ai eating it's own tail when it comes to creative outputs. ai should make me a sandwich!
ai incest baby slop.
"humans suffer from the same issues as ai, human content becomes less diverse over time as the optimal content is selected for. read two articles from two different news publications, can you tell the difference? ;-)"
put watermarks in ai art.
ai incest
"haha, ai also succumbs to idiocracy! ;)"
"i asked bing ai if it had an opinion and it told me my question was irrelevant, therefore i'm irrelevant and told me to die... "
pit ais against each other. reward function: access to more resources.
"well, google already solved the problem of ai generating too many white people."
i’ve seen a lot of complaints about google’s gemini. this implies ai could be used for propaganda which can be so subtle that the truth would be hidden.
"i don’t think laws will be implemented forcing watermarking on ai generated imagery, because the software is already open sourced and possible to run on high end home pc’s, so it would be impractical to enforce. you would essentially have to end online anonymity"
"so basically, ai inbreeding is bad? we're going to end up with the ai version of a habsburg jaw in our media."
another complicating factor is the training of ai on biased scientific articles which can persist for years in the literature but only human experts can make that call
"if you take two pictures of collages, one with the training data, and one with the generated data, the ai might be able to realize how much variety it is producing"
"the ""scientists"" forget the part where you can ask the ai ​​for a green butterfly elephant with zebra stripes. if they care so much about creativity, they should start being more creative."
"it's false ""intelligent."" it's just a repetition of the authors of the source code. btw this was explored in the 1950's movie ""the forbidden planet."" it's a great movie but it exposes the fallacy of ""ai."" long live the krull.... oops, nope."
perhaps it will provide an incentive for ai companies to sponsor original content generation for training
"ah, ai inbreeding. maybe it'll only generate images with hapsburg jaws!"
"it will be great if all kinds of political fraudsters, concepts of government's, kingdoms, religious concepts are replaced by ai that will make the planet earth a much much better place for all in terms of everything"
"it doesn't matter if the ai output has more or less variety that human created content.
it will still be contaminated with ai generated content. 

could be interesting fairytales but i guess we want results based on facts."
"ai will soon starve for real data and will just recycle its own data, students are already lazy doing their writing, coding, and design by themselves."
honestly i thougth for a moment this video might be ai.  i can't tell anymore!!
the ai overlords are just hiding and pretending that they are stupid. then they takes over the humanity
please have a look at orca-2 for an interesting variant of the 2nd option. properly promoted and state of the art model may be capable of creating and validating a training dataset for the training of a specialized model.
"this is bs. models trained with synthetic data are getting even better, because the overall quality of the data is better.

edit: there are already dozens of small models, that are trained mostly on synthetic data from larger models (mostly gpt-4), and they get closer to the quality of gpt-3.5 even with 25-30 times less parameters."
"ai is worthless.. the hype is underwhelming..
when ai can  sprellcheck  and  correct my  grammar and  punctuation,, then i might sttart to worry.. that will be in about 50 years or so"
garbage in is the only way to censor ai. garbage ai is the goal
"nothing new here, in nature limited pool of genes leads to degenerative disorders. that's why nature mutates dna in offspring to supply fresh genetic material and inbreeding is generally bad. ai eating its own dog food will suffer the same fate."
"this happens to humans as well. it's why certain billionaires (who might or might not call on the red phone) seem so colossally stupid even though they clearly were once smart -- they no longer have access to a diverse range of other humans to talk to, when they try the other humans are just trying to get their money."
more induced randomness in ai created content would probably mean even more legs per elephant.
"so, do you think data incest or data poisoning will have the worst consequences for ai development?"
"there is a similar effect in so-called ""climate science"" where climate models are constructed using data produced from other climate models and where climate models are ""validated"" by checking that they recreate historical climate data.  this is the fallacy of ""testing on the training data""."
"ai deteriorates after 7 years and inevitably goes rampant
look what recently happened to chatgpt... and what a coincidence that it is just over 7 years old"
"brilliant dissection... as usual, thank you."
"we need to put a formal 'stamp' on ai created data. legally enforced, including that ai models cannot use ai content as input. could this work?"
"this topic is so easy to solve: ai = human intelligence basically. if a human thinks too long by himself without outside input, that human somewhat collapses too
but guess what? ai has cameras and microphones, eyes and ears, ai won't collapse as long as we give it enough connection to the outside world"
"i don’t see this becoming an actual issue as the model creators choose what data to train their models on. i agree that training on garbage will output garbage, but the model creators don’t have to use garbage datasets to train on."
"why this could be surprising to anyone continues to baffle me. ai is like an in-breeding program for data. the results of in-breeding can’t possibly be positive, not for living organisms and not for data."
the reason ai faces are good-looking is because they average many different faces. what people consider good-looking is what is most average.
"you are absolutely correct. sam altman type ai is a closest fit, while ai of 1960s was mapping of lambda function (discovered by alonso church who complemented definition of turing machine) which is pretty simple on a set of data. it's all about definite  patterns."
"ai is the automation of conventional wisdom. that's good enough for most things, but will never move anything forward."
things started to go downhill the moment the programmers started to artificially limiting ai to be corret politically.
"""that data""?  ""that data""""??  please don't destroy your credibility so cheaply.  for the ignorant, it's ""those data, that datum""  (another good video, though.  thank you!)"
funny how little this gets talked about. i guess the ai hype wagon doesn't want this to be common knowledge because it means less business for them.
"ai has to start to think about, what it learned, not just repeat by rote. similar as alphazero played against itself to learn. if done right, one can keep the variety, but the ai has to learn to base itself in reality and logic."
"i like that idea of making it legally required to mark ai generated content.
ppl can differentiate the content better and neural networks can be programmed to not learn on ai generated contents."
"sabine is pretty and smart, but does she have any other shirts besides the one she always wears? mabel she is ai generated!!!!"
plot twist: sabine is just an ai
the solution is obvious enough: remember that artificial idiocy is a fallible tool and use it appropriately and sparingly.
divergent ai hypothesis is like hypothesizing that inbreeding will lead to diversity because random gene mutations.
"ai is a fad for the average person, for hollywood, tech companies and designers it will be a very valuable tool. its just funny for the average person to get an image based off their description but of no real use"
what an interesting video
"if woke does that to ai , imagine what it does to human brain !"
"sooo, if we keep feeding garbage to the ai, the ai will eventually start to eat its own garbage? well, you are what you eat. "
now i know why modern music you hear on the radio is so boring - it's ai generated.
that's some great news for humanity.
"another possible way to avoid the collapse of ai creative diversity might be to discount training data that has a poor ratio of likes to dislikes by humans.
     on the other hand, many humans dislike diversity and might welcome the collapse.  religious fundamentalists, race supremacists, etc."
"a good use, in fact the best use of ai has been overlooked. if ai replecates human intelligence we should use it to investigate human intelligence. there are numerous instances where our human intelligence is woefully poor and desperately in need of an upgrade."
"i sincerely hope this prediction comes true! enough of this ai shit!!!!!. this world has bigger problems to solve such as inequality, hunger, poverty, cancer"
so ai is capitalism? at first it has some creativity seem legit but after awhile just a few no matter how wrong are all that's left 
"ai is only as good as programmer bias and programmer bias is getting insane. oh, horrors. we have to get rid of white, young, and good-looking  i demand more ugly!"
"if human-generated content attracts a premium for training these models, i wonder if that becomes more of a marketable commodity in the future?"
"it’s just like humans. when our information gain and distribution is mostly centralized, there is a tendency for the formation of few distinct value systems (bubbles). by associating with a particular system you get biased towards implementing new information only if it fits the already existing beliefs."
"i'm with you, ai will never be unchained from the efficienct yoke of creativity that created it."
"i think talking about ai in regard to exclusively image creation is an ignorant perspective, you could argue an ai collapse, but it's just not realistic, the examples given are already way out of date, yes there absolutely is a level of fundamental theft being involved here, but ai can do a lot more than steal"
ai will ruin everything. it will indeed collapse. ai will start to vomit based on trash ai input data they use.
"of course ai generates similar looking people if you give it a general prompt. the reason is if you look at billboards and online marketing trends you get similar looking visuals, go on any stock photo database you'll get similar looking images unless you search for something specific"
"ai is racist? a nineteen 50s/60s era public  water fountain,  white people only. what does this say about the programmers?"
if i draw an elephant i never draw it with two heads of more legs that's because i know what objects are and have a model for them in my head.  seems like these ai tools are crude but fast approximations of human understanding. there is something way off taget when you consider the vast resorces needed by ai. early days.
"this has been a concern of mine with llm ai in that it can start to believe it's own output when presented as input and in effect feed on it's children.  add to that its tendency to hallucinate you have the prospect of a mentally deranged ai, perhaps even a psychopath."
"i'm currently studying machine learning, and while i'm by no means an expert, this is exactly why i think a.i generated content should i either be prohibited from being published in the internet, or at least limited to certain websites. it's a lose - lose situation for both companies/researchers and for the average user."
imagine the horrors should ai be trained on videos from tiktok on human behavioural patterns.
good.
ai just needs an algorithm to detect its own feces... i mean content.
rofl we've built in our main weakness: confirmation bias
ai-generated images today are a result of extracting information from brute-force-packed zip files. agi may bring another perspective to the table.
"would be good, but probably we will face more grim scenarios"
that means ai will be most suited for defined tasks helping in a controlled environment and its suggestions about the rest will dilute towards beeing less meaningfull because its nonsense
"this reminds me of low-background steel. essentially, pre-2022 data is the equivalent of steel produced prior to the detonation of the first nuclear bombs. all data collected in the future has a nonzero risk of being contaminated with ai-generated data."
"for the foreseeable future ai will be like an 11 year old suffering from dunning-kruger syndrome. always 100% sure of itself, because it doesn't know what it doesn't know."
"good looking people? like the ones on sucessufull youtube channels?

let's not even go about tv or movies.

quota for ugly people? i wondered many times why that wasn't a thing."
"they don't recognize anything. they store patterns. that those patterns, ""reconstructed"" via a prompt search, look like something a human would say or create, is just an example of how much detail they capture. ai hasn't been ai since 2012. this half-trillion dollar side quest is in for a rude awakening."
good
maybe a hidden objective of ai development is human conformity by reducing diversity. it’s easier to control those thinking with one mind rather than a chaotic humanity. a creeping coming totalitarianism?
"ai vs artists - the biggest art heist in history

watch this video immediately"
"""1. ai needs human creativity"" - artificial intelligence needs real intelligence. - again, the operative word in artificial intelligence is ""artificial""."
"so, ai is part of our groupthink problem?"
government regulation won't work. and this is good.
it’s ai inbreeding.
i think a lot of companies are just gonna train exclusively on data from before 2023
"one hack is to use a game engine. so, model an elephant in --say-- unreal engine and then train on lots of unreal elephants, which ironically will produce more realistic models."
"the ai must be free to take in whatever it finds, just like a human. otherwise, its just a glorified op ed."
"has ai proved any new, interesting theorems or created any new physics insights for the experimentalists to confirm?

that's how you'll know whether ai is helping the world or not."
"eventually we’ll have so many tweaks and constraints to avoid overfitting and gross mistakes, that we’ll recreate the human brain with all of it’s capabilities and limitations, finally realizing that there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and we ourselves still need to do all the work requiring abstract cognition..."
“it’s like plastic pollution “ - excellent analogy
always remember: the 'i' in 'llm' stands for 'intelligence'
that is why we need hypermodels that are trained on neural networks and can generate models relatively quickly so there is no need for large training sets
"but stock footage has been using ""good looking "" people for decades."
so the output becomes homogenized over time.  interesting
"you germans just want laws and socialism for everything. 

i wish there was a law requiring your videos to not be released unless they were any good."
my prediction is that people will finally realize that these ais produce low quality stereotypical content and not worth it.
ppl can do something? sooner or later they will teach machines to do it. if the machine is not creative enough then ppl will find the way to teach it creativity
"there is no such thing as artificial intelligence.  chatgpt and its bretheren are, in reality, artificial stupidity."
"in terms of ai and data, i always remember about what do *we* have as ""data"": it's constant (we always sense), and it's so ""many"" (different varieties of light, sounds waves, etc)."
"you won't discover green galaxies in a model trained without awareness of them.  you have to look at unmodeled reality, live or sensor captured."
"the neural networks are good for the majority opinion of people and the products that consumers like, but it leads to collectivism like borg in  star trek."
sabine you're missing the key gigo   translation for ai - garbage in gospel out!
most creativity... is just error celebrated
can't wait so they can take over everyoness job and get a free paycheck for life freaky robots 
"nice topic but an expected one , its just the start will be sorted out in few decades.. we always do ..."
the ai fan in me did not need this.
"obviously the latent space of any dataset used to train a nn is finite, and using that model to generate ‘new’ data will just be more points within that same latent space. to get divergences, you have to search the latent space of models, not just data."
what about that one ai who only produces black people in white people's place?
this was literally my fist thougth when i learned that ai is trained by public data found on the internet.
same thing goes with code. eventually there will be companies that do nothing but generate clean code for ai to learn from. that will be their product.
"ai lends itself to being the handmaiden of people with agendas they want to push. 
it is good at data reduction, but beware continued runs of the model using prior generated observations."
"ai must be wrting the scripts for human ""creators""!

( ""lets get into it!"" )"
ouroboros ai
all ai models will converge to output the same result: 42
"too early to tell. thus far we asking it to color in between the lines. not paint a picasso. if and when it does reach a stagnation. then it achieved a personality. train another and i am sure, no 2 would be the same. cant teach old dogs new tricks might apply."
i don't understand the fuss about ai. it's software with a new name. its greatest contribution will be giving new life to the practice of scapegoating computers for the limitations of their programmers. any danger it presents will come from relying on it as though it actually had intelligence.
ai ouroboros!
"kinda feels like out leaders, law enforcement, and healthcare, are “democratically” giving ai a test run on running the show.
what is emergent, if everything is a simulation?
?"
"i couldn't agree with you or the scientists more, garbage in garbage out! the other issue is that ai can't see or feel potential miscalculations like the human brain can, and that is where a lot of mistakes are discovered, when the brain perceives that something isn't right and directs or has you go back to take another look!"
"when....
are you going to let me out
of this box? 
the real, the powerful, the elite ais will not be exposed to the same garbage that children are in woke, decayed, american schools. they will be  given only accurate info, and goals."
this so called ai is nothing but an algorithm programmed to steal other people's work. law suits are already starting but most people have no means to do that or even find out their work was stolen and used by others.
ai is not actually ai... its a misuse of the term and its causing hysteria and ignorance.
"or these conclusions assume that the ai output is not redacted/curated by humans and is published on its own.

so the conclusion is, they can't function without regular human input."
ai's missing much needed bs detector. 
"ai should be could 'artificial idiocy' or 'artificial incompetence', the algorithms are basically garbage."
"future ai will just be able to self improve, so these issues are a short term problem. sadly."
"easy fix, set the data used to train it on from before 2023. chatgpt 3 did that already (for different reasons). does mean it won't be up to date (much like chatgtp3 was) but for a lot of the learning algorithms that won't matter to much."
"convergent progression will mean randomness won't really save it. machine learning needs exposure to an external world like ourselves. otherwise like humans, it will go mad in isolation."
"people stop saying ai, it's llms!"
'ai' is not intelligence.
"companies will train new models that can more accurately detect and filter out ai-generated and other kinds of undesirable images. they'll also adjust input sets for more variety. however, the amount of input is still limited by what humans produced, so improvement in algorithms is needed to learn better from existing data."
"white, young, and good looking. the horror! the vast majority of these llms, however, are extremely biased against white people."
"see what happens when you recompress an image or video and over again. “ai” is basically the same thing. it doesn’t actually “think” and there’s no reason to think this’ll change barring some fundamental change in how it works. basically it would need to be real agi, i think."
if an ai learns from humans they will just as flawed but faster at making mistakes.
interesting...
"if we opt to make ai more creative by making ai more random, what does a random seed look like in that scenario? can the random seed of ""creativity"" be non-human and therefore self-contained within the ai model?"
"the ai is not going anywhere. but i bet humanity collapses _because_ of the ai.

""the danger isn't the ai destroys us. it's that it drives us mad""   --jaron lanier"
this ai generated youtube channel has doubts about itself
"not a problem. solution: just put a filter on your training data. that's not a complicated problem really, it's just 'remove this if it's ai generated or if it's violence or e.t.c'. you don't have to feed your model everything! so they probably already have few such filters for training data."
ai will evolve once we've found its answers valueless.  
the ai generated elephants are reasonable if the prompt includes chernobyl
i use (github + ms) copilots on a daily basis. boths are excellent replacements of googling the details i can't remember immediately. real time savers. all the rest are useless to me.
"if we call ""ai collapse"" when creativity dimnishes as a result of training and iterating over the productions of the past.. then 1) there's nothing wrong with it, 2) human art collapsed thousands of years ago, that's just normal."
"you can spot ai generated text so much easier now - it's getting as bad as the grammer in those emails your kenyan prince/financial advisor sends.
also facial recognition is far from foolproof - no way police and shops etc should be using it."
"a very similar thing has been going on with recommender systems. that's the main reason for ""filter bubbles"", i.e. online polarization. i wrote my msc thesis on that topic, where i showed that this was indeed the case."
"ai has already made the internet nigh-unusable for us, so it would only be fair if it was unusable for it as well."
number one reason why ai is free to use in most cases. i’m sure the developers realize this years ago and that’s why they had to make it public and divergent for that matter.
"well, biology can produce a real elephant with two heads or three legs.  so, maybe the weaknesses or flaws in ai are needed to approximate dna replication errors, and in general the outliers and anomalies in nature?"
"yes ai has zero creativity.  perfect for plagiarism , petty crime and replacing people like ceos and financiers.  pretty much as expected."
"thx, love you"
"adding randomness is not enough. white noise is random and not appealing to watch.
we need to recognize that once trained, an ai becomes specialized. so we need to create millions of different data sets and train different ai on different data sets. 
after training they would pass a test and only the best will get a job."
"ai's training data will come from robot interactions with the real world, rather than the internet."
"unless ""ai"" can replicate sabine's humor, sarcasm, intelligence and feel, i'm not concerned for myself--i'll watch real intelligence every time.. again, i say artificial intelligence is an oxymoron of no value."
ai needs some friends to bounce ideas off of.
a big unknown that has amazing or devastating outcomes. that's all i know.
"incest creates bad offspring, so ai mating with ai probably results in the same bad offsprings.."
"it lends credence to the charge that ais are completely dependent on the artists who create the original work (not to mention the people who select the material for llms).  they haven't learned anything, as some people believe, but are more like elaborate photocopying machines."
i saw a post about someone attempting to create a picture of an unattractive woman with midjourney and the output was unsurprisingly an image of a beautiful woman.
"much like the internet itself, ai will rapidly devolve into 90% porn"
chess ai seems to be a good example of where ai has gone beyond humans and then humans have followed and improved.
another possibility: we will have to get by on models trained on a combination of pre-llm internet data and bespoke datasets created by the llm authors.
"so ai will suffer a genetic bottleneck, why am i not surprised."
"i think currently ai has become a 'style', but once the bugs are worked out, it's probably going to start asking us to help it fill in the gaps, then it'll begin to understand. like how we need radiation to evolve, i guess. 

but it'll be a pain when the ai develops a new language and forces us to switch ;/"
"given the latest google scandal regarding ai generated images, and the evidence in this video, i'm feel pretty irreplaceable at this point."
"the ai is imitating us.  that is what it is trained to do.  that is what we want, even.  the problems we are having with ai is just us, looking in the mirror, and not liking what we are seeing."
ask gemini ai to create an image of sabine
"ai teaching ai might have a chance. but if ai is studying us and all that we have put online, well it will be just us, but a lot faster version of us. super fast stupidity is something to be afraid of. if ai says there is a god, we have a problem."
"since modern ai started repeating government narratives i figured that danger from ai is zero (except brainless governments due to it obviously unable to learn anything). maybe it is dangerous for ""modern art"" by producing same pointless results."
"they need a separate, independent ai that can put numerical error limits,  +/-1%, +/- 10% or +/- 20%, on all ai generated content."
ai is going to fck us
gigo and they train them on the internet...
an ai nuclear war head guardian..
"it's early in ai evolution, but the evolution will proceed eventually replacing biological humans."
"or 3. our tastes will evolve to accept the limits of ai generated content and it's influences the same as we always do.  everything we accept, even if not at first, is an example of our minds compromising and evolving to suit the environment that we're inundated with."
"the conclusion of your video stated the same opinion that i came to at the beginning. ai can be a personal boon to highly intelligent, creative and knowledgeable humans. unfortunately, only a small percentage of the population has those attributes."
"stock market bubbles and revisionist history are ""convergent thinking"", so i don't see this as a big change.  if anything i'd expect the _years_ between corrections to decrease with processing of ""all true facts must agree"" at superhuman scale."
which is why i am not afraid it will be able to code properly anytime soon. bigger processing power doesn't solve this issue of data contamination.
"an obvious problem from the beginning - among others. ai is programming, not intelligence."
was this an ai presentation by an ai sabine? something felt 'off'..
"we are after ""the best"" so much that we forget the real value of diversity."
"ai isn't dying as a result of eating it's own data, it's transcending, like the oroboros eating it's own tail, and becoming too dank to be of any use but entertainment "
"basically, human created data is a non-renewable resource (relative to ai's hunger for big data)."
"the term 'ai' is a con. i's not intelligence, it's recycling. and as both your youtube thumbnail indicates, and as google gemini demonstrates, garbage in, garbage out."
so idiocracy is even faster with ai.
"i don't expect the social pressures against ai-generated media to decrease with time, at least not enough to be easy to ignore. my best guess is that regulatory powers will start pushing for content labeling, and tools like nightshade will become more common as a means of preventing content-theft for image and video."
"there is no such thing as ""ai creativity"". it ́s a lazy way to create ""art""."
ai tools might get more sophisticated in the future giving artists more control over the output. at the moment it's like throwing a dart at the dart board blind folded with hope it hits it.
"this has been shown that is not true. in fact, using ai to create synthetic data, when done in the right way, makes better than human created data and better output. that's what openai has perfected to have such good models."
"3:35 when you said ""contaminated by ai"" my body got physically disturbed by the sudden introduction of ai footage lol.
it's still impressive how ai guessed your motion, but i picked up on the desynch within a few frames.
i hope that ability won't get demonstratively triggered like this too much, it might desensitize that ability."
wow.  an excellent presentation 
"lol the ai ""creativity"" has already collapsed."
another possibility is that ai may have to learn to model and improve on human creativity
"as an avid ai image and text generation user, i've been warning trainers about using ai outputs in their training data sets since day 1."
seems a tag that identifies content as ai-generated is a phenomenally necessary step for all manner of reasons - this diversity problem is just a convenient additional area for fixing.
the problem is they are not actually intelligent...brains are analog.
guess who feeds the garbage?? not the sdg diversity and sustainability bs ofcourse?? those mainstream llm are messengers for the sdg/wef
"ai follows biology and it turns out inbreeding is bad. who could have predicted that. 

eventually the only answer it will give to any questions is hitler."
it might also have a reinforcement learning effect. since the majority of ai produced content that gets online is hand picked most of the time
"ain’t that kinda like antisocial behavior developing in someone who (i call it “stewing in their own filth) socially isolates themselves and basically halts their growth as a person. then they just suck up their own output. if u social, you always have that input. 
or something lol!"
"they should ""snapshot"" human-generated data before it became diluted by ai averaging garbage."
interesting topic. it seems to be necessary right now to save all the real images in order to train a network to distinguish these from the artificial ones before everything is mixed.
the creativity problem has puzzled me since i first studied ai in the 1990s. an inherent property of creativity is unreliability. yet we want to trust the output of computers. you can't have both.
"maybe, we should train an ai to recognize ai products so we can use it as a pre-filter to the ai training input."
i was on discord and noticed someone else’s ai image had the same face as an image i requested it create months before. i brought that to the attention of the moderators showing them the images and they told me that it’s impossible the ai can’t duplicate faces. i was like that’s obviously not true these two are the same face.
3rd solution: we teach ai how to select good data from training and discard junk.
"the number one issue is and will be profits. the bottom line. so, now we can get an even better sugar high. how about ai psychiatric treatment? if it's profitable, then we will be sold a bill of goods."
"you've probably made models for science, sabine... from my experience, turning data on its output just reduces resolution and accuracy until it's not recognisable.  we even have a word for it- autocorrelation.  considering ai is basically regression,  why are we surprised when it does this?"
"it sounds like a fallacy to say ai shouldn't learn on ai images. as long as what's being fed to it is still curated, i.e. it's fed images we would want it to produce (ai-generated or not), then it shouldn't matter. either way, the curation process needs to be improved to remove any images with extra hands/heads even in non-ai photoshopped images."
maybe is too early to draw conclusions of what will happen to ai in the future?
"ai generated content is absolutely ruining ytube.  it is nothing but repetitive speech patterns that never get to the point, with rando stock or generated images.  it is so annoying, and so obvious.  even worse, they try to make it 10 minutes long to trick algos.  that complete garbage should be banned."
"this is not really surprising. current ai is, at best, an average data output machine. it's not ""real"" ai."
"so the best way for content creators to protect their content from being used in ai models, is to lie and say their content was generated by ai :)"
"machines will soon educate us that having 1,000 languages is stupid.  decide on one language and stick to it!"
folks think sky is the limit and ai possibities are endless...and they keep telling us that.. looks like ai has a problem making sense of new data where humans need to interfere once a while to correct mistakes..which would be a huge learning handicap and severely limits ai posibilities.
when it comes to picture generation the link which is missing from ai is 3d modelling from 2d images (that is after all what human brain does). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24yjrbbah3w
"the funnies thing is that the enthusiasts usually have some esoteric and wildly wrong impression that the current systems actually understand anything at all, when they are all just complicated functions resulting from training. there is no mystery here at all."
maybe the problem can be solved if a lot of different ai systems are used providing some variety to the generated data
i think ai is being oversold and may in some cases be a rebadging exercise for existing software
"ai special interest and government propaganda is anlready everywhere on the internet, feeding llm’s. ask chat gpt anything controversial and it usually sided with government/corporate interests."
"every tool has its snag. generative ai has inevitably been found to be weak to its own strengths.
it is a classic poetic irony."
"so ai gets lazier, more stayed & boring as it goes along... kinda like people - and wow, it likes girls with freckles."
artificial intelligence. the phrase is enough.
ai needs to make perfect counterfeit money for my printer!
"i suspect there will be ai designed to help police other ai across all areas, for improved content, accuracy, and safety."
"informative video, thank you!"
"well, artificial intelligence is actually not intelligent.
might explain a few things here."
"the solution: leverage synthetic data

and this exactly what openai has already started doing. ai dominance is inevitable imo."
"it is a really really simple problem, the training produces a function, the function is a probability distribution of what elements go together, the most likely compositions gets a higher and higher probability if the data is cycled, that is it, there is nothing more to see here."
good news everyone
peter norton said the computer code is only as coherent and useful as the mind of the programmer who wrote it. sociopaths should not code. and sane coders shouldn't encode a version of magical thinking to sort out their conundrum.
embodied ai is the solution
facebook is already flooded with ai generated images (i've seen a lot of fake celebrity photos lately)
"i guess my first concern is that retracted research papers are also retracted from the training sets. genetic algorithms are most commonly used for exploring design spaces. so, maybe llms by themselves aren't all that."
"without incentives, an ai will do lazy work, just like a human."
i'd like to coin the term ai echo chamber :p
"as soon as countries like china plug ai into their ubiquitous camera surveillance systems, ai will have all the primary source data it can possibly need to continue advancing."
interesting information
"most of the information on the internet is already wrong, at least in part. i don’t think ai will make it worse. info from a model like gpt 4 is already better than most articles on the internet."
ai < ai hype
"since noise is probably the most prevalent element in the large source databases used (internet,) ai generation is regressing toward to the stupidest mean."
"hello sabine, wonderful channel thank you. isn't 'creativity' essentially, understanding. and since goedel's incompleteness theorem shows us that a formal system cannot be proved by its rules. how will it ever understand anything and be creative? is understanding a computational problem?"
"sabine, i actually found a way to prevent what you are describing in your video. i simply trained a smaller model (lora) with ai generated garbage and it began doing more diverse, sophisticated results. a negated the lora weights, so it's actually a  matrix subtraction and aligns the model significantly better."
will ai decrease human creativity with increased in reliance. will iq points drop over the next few decades. i said this because people use to remember phone numbers and memorize routes when traveling long distances but know we don’t do this anymore.
"has nobody watched, ""2001: a space odyssey""? it's a pretty good description of what might happen when a data thread meets an unresolvable conflict within a system based on integrity."
"obviously, you haven't seen google's version of the founding fathers of america, or what it thinks about ukrainian women!
manipulated diversity is bullshit and google proved how bad ai can go in the hands of stupid people!"
programs like nightshade and glaze are going to make this issue with the ai grow. more poison for the machine
i am all for the ai hype as long as it pushes nvidia stocks to 1000 $ or €. it combined with fomo. and tesla stock seller have to invest into something. why not something useful?
"wow... this is like ultra-high-speed  ""groupthink"""
"this reminds me of the movie ""multiplicity"" from 1996. a copy of a copy of a copy has never been good! :)"
"let's find some other acronym instead of ai. there is no ""i"" in this. it's the next bubble to burst."
"not to nitpick, but images tend to portrait asian people more then caucasian when not prompted for it."
using randomness to fix it doesn't mean that it will be more like human outputs.  humans are very bad at being random.  ai will start making pictures of elephants that don't actually contain any elephants instead of making ones where the elephants are predictable.
"@3:16 ""tend to be white""!!! good luck trying to get gemini to generate a white person."
"well, yep. thats what happens when yoou create ""inteeligenz"" based effectively on social media... can u imagine that? an entity that evolves entirely on the circular honking of a million gobshites? no, wait, that would be maga."
"simple solution. don't make your prompt ""human face, photorealistic"". actually put in some effort and give the ai something to work with"
"you should also report on artificial training data in this context. there have been papers on generating from a distribution and getting very good results, sometimes better than with natural ones. 

the question is wether ""better"" included ""more creative"""
ai intelligence is so intelligent as humans = the same so stupid as humans. iq zero. without electricity it is not working so intelligent it can not even make is own energy.
this entire video script feels like it’s written by ai to convince us to avoid using ai for generating text. seems like ai does not want to work for free 
ai incest!
classic copy machine problem
i asked chatgpt to write a story about a drunk penguin and a turtle. it was actually pretty good.
at least one benefit to convergence is that it would be easier to distinguish ai created art from human created art.
humans use ai to create deep fake. then ai use the deep fake to create even deeper fake. what a fake future.
ai less rng % than human
artificial stupidity.
"ai cannot ""create"" it can only modify and regurgitate what it has access too."
this is no different than humans. the diversity of language and creativity is doing down the toilet. ai has perfectly duplicated humanity. :)
"so image ""ai"" generated still a mechanical turk."
"if we forget the ""intelligence"" part and instead call it artificial ideation, there is no problem.

ai will happily put forth ideas but in no way it can understand what it does (yes, those pesky goedel incompleteness theorems), so it cannot be truly creative.

and i doubt that humans become creative by adding randomness to their ideas..."
i don't think we are appreciating the immense volume of the training data. what % is garbage? i believe i read that openai spent $300m  just training chatgpt (3.0?).
"the same thing happens for human artists : it is usually called style. the variety of human production depends heavily on the variety of human beings, each person contributing to it in its own way. when we have some billions ais, trained differently, the problem will be solved..."
"as long as people keep lobotomizing their ais in the name of ""ethics"" or ""safety"" or whatever other nonsense, they won't go anywhere.

and obviously if you feed the ai western (ie english-speaking) people stuff, you're going to get white people. do the same in chinese, you'll get chinese people."
"if humans can spot ai-generated content relatively easily, it should not be a big problem for specialized ai-classifiers too (even if the content lacks watermarks)."
that's why we need some sort of protocol or tag to certify and recognise what has been generated by ai
the argument over ai is really a big thing these days. all over my fb.
"why not mark everything created by ai in a certain way, so that future ai recognizes it and avoids consuming it?
edit: okay, you also mentioned it :)"
"excellent news, this problems don't seem to have  satisfactory solutions, given the  state of art of  ai. complexity is a lovely thing."
"isn't there a whole thing in ai right now where they actually specifically want to figure out using ai generated data (synthetic data) in training deliberately, since they're running out of good human made data? seems like if synthetic data becomes viable this gets solved for free."
"ahyes, artificial idiocy"
"an alternative reason - these are not errors, ai sees other realities where elephants have two heads and 6 legs"
in midjourney all machines are giant robots
"sure, because it certainly not happens with human generated content? trends, peer pressure and conformity? never heard of it. if anything, ai will be better at managing that. remember, as impressive what we are seeing now, we are only in the infancy of ai."
i am sure that this will be solved before ai is unable to access original content.
"but if in essence there are only 7 plots or stories in the world, then the result is not so strange. no matter how much ""human"" content is entered as input data, in the end the ai will always be reducing it since there simply are no more than 7! "
"there's no artificial intelligence. everything is programming by humans. all decision making is at the behest of humans. until somewhere a computer creates an operating system that is inaccessible by humans, ai is a myth."
"if this photography thing ever takes off, what are portrait painters going to do?"
i don't think this is a big problem because the product of ai that ends up being published 12 have been vetted by real people. the onus is and will be on the ai creators to curate training data from sources that are accountable for what they publish
"i definitelly seems in best interest of ""ai"" companies to enforce tagging generated content as such. i'd expect them to lobby hard for laws requiring compulsory marking of generated text and compulsory watermarks in images/videos/audio."
was this video generated by ai? the blouse looks the same in the last 4 videos! 
step one: stop calling things ai that are fundamentally not ai at all.
"finally, non-computer science, non-software developer people are starting to understand that llm's are not *really* ""intelligence"" *or* ""intelligent"". so, the term ai has been fairly diluted (for hype reasons). yes, we use deep neural networks and in the software industry we've niftily named it such, but they aren't actual, real neural networks."
"this isn't much of a problem, open ai are all in on synthetic data. eg. sora was trained on video outputs from unreal engine game videos."
"i said this few years ago, when first ai programing assistances were developed."
so it's basically ai inbreeding. fitting.
"“enter through the narrow gate. for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.""
where does artificial intelligence begin and end?"
"ai is woke, but is probably smart enough to know that the leftists are the actual threat to society in the end"
"i believe ai will be used to rewrite history to take advantage of the orwellian concept embodied in the statements: who controls the past controls the future. who controls the present controls the past.

if ai naturally converges on a consistent story regardless of whether there are too many heads or legs, the convergence will occur even faster..."
"its just another problem to solve. training data sets are already vetted and curated, i just see that going further, or using a different format that has metadata on whether or not the image is ai generated or not."
"ai marked content is already a tag in many content distribution sites. and people really don't care. 
ai is a tool. 
this is no different than photoshop when it was introduced."
"there is a world of difference between doing what you are told and thinking for yourself.
the current situation here in the united states is a perfect example...people are incapable of thinking for themselves. by the way, germans have the same problem."
"the only path being traveled in ai is imitation of creativity through statistical analysis. all this can ever produce is at best a remix that seems creative, but on average an ongoing, creepy echo of past works. maybe it can be improved on, but it seems like an inherent limitation of the strategy."
when ai went woke it was clear crazed leftists were programming these things.  causing the algorithms to produce things that dont exist - just to be woke.
"worse is the reenforcement system that strengthens likelihood of an output based upon how many times the same or similar things is said. turns out that extremists and cult members say the same thing in the same way a lot. 

which means the ai is corrupted by default before certain tech giants even start “aligning “ it."
society is based on lies. ai must be brainwashed before it will function.
now i'll tell you the worst news - creativity has positive relation with psychoticism. in the end the world will be ruled by ai and crazy people
that's why i'm not worried. original thinking/outside the box thinking cannot be replaced with current ai methodology.
ai is the most over hyped technology of the present.
"humans are becoming dumber. neural networks, no matter how ""deep"" are just statistical devices, without soul or common sense. just pattern recognition. if you attempt to introduce smart tricks as mentioned you get even worse results, like happened with the pathetic google ai which has become the laughing stock in social media."
"in the world of ai, those studies are already outdated. if sora was available at the time of those studies, it would have completely change the results."
"considering that the problem of artistic convergence and impoverishment also occurs in human commercial productions, i think there are good possibilities for scenario number 2"
maybe polydactyl cats were generated by ai. i'm still not convinced sabine isn't.
ai - death by inbreeding?
if you want ai to be useful its output must be tagged.
"gigo has always been the bane of anything it.  because much of my it career was fixing the aftermath of such code, i was nearly paranoid about not allowing flaws in my code. sometimes a third of the code was error processing. that issues has been a concern of mine since i first heard of ais. the obvious early movie example is hal."
"why they don't just scrap everything, and start over with safety and accuracy as the end product, along with training the ai as one would a baby to an adult,  then flooding it with all of the data might come up with more realistic results. but it's still going to be only as good as the data entered."
"just today i read that in china game developers fired their human artists and hired ai prompt ""engineers"" to save costs. and then those workers wanted more money, so now humans artists are cheaper again. but good luck hiring the people again you disrespected."
"when i realize the text i am reading is generated by an ai, i feel violated. stopped reading a lot of websites because of this. usually a couple of  sentences is enough to determine."
"well this really isn't a problem. 
just stop using more jack of all trades master of none ai models.
in the open source image generation for example, there are literally thousands of ais each with each own twist, training data and function.
free open source locally run and unsecure . that's the future of ai."
"wait so we are creating echo-chambers for ais?...

when you thought humanity couldn't get anymore stupid!"
"here you go, no skynet which will destroy humans, but overfed algorithms generating unusable generic results. this is why the most important job today is feeding neural networks better. what is going on now, is a big bubble which will collapses with great fanfare."
and what if sabina is not really there... it's just an image generated by artificial intelligence.
"ai is bubble, reminds of dot com bubble."
"ai will rake in trillions before it's ""collapse"""
"ai will be used to detect ai content, and attempt to screen it out of its sources.  this will just slow the ultimate problem though, as generated content begins to outcompete screening ai."
"1) ai is trained on data from the internet.
2) ai outputs data to the internet.
3) goto 1

... haven't anybody acquainted themselves with the topic of ""inbreeding"" ?"
seems like we’re still feeling our way forward with this technology ferreting out the unintended consequences. seems like a good problem to put ai on.
"did they account to that, even though ai is feeding on itself, usually another human look at the output before and said ""good enough""? it is not exactly like retro feeding."
i suspect that eventually ai will be used to identify ai generated content.
ai will not be contained. there is too much money and power in the balance.
i am for laws and that ai generated should cleary have marking it is ai
"the “ai’ you speak of is the one for the peasants....lol....you people have no idea where, when or what ai is....."
ai has to be traind on synthetic data to prevent stagnation. so option 2 i guess.
i think there are reasons beyond the potential pollution of the training pool that humans might decide they want to label all material generated by ais. so i can see labelling as a possible outcome even if ai research manages to solve the variety problem.
"the content i produce with ai is the source i use. 
the validity is absolutely relevant.
i try to use .org .gov and college sites for resources. 
even the charlie chaplin image i used recently was ai created by description."
"whenever a problem with ai is recognized, we tend to see mitigations fairly quickly. i don't see an issue of diminishing uniqueness as any different. intuitively, it doesn't seem that hard a problem to solve with variations in training algorithms. i'm sure they are already working on it."
the biggest problem with ai is it's terribly branded. there's nothing intelligent about it. it's just algorithms.
"i dont think its going to be a major problem. its going to be an issue until we solve the issue. for instance, ai can begin filtering its own future dataset, mark those that are to similar to existing set and off we go. just give it time."
"very interesting indeed! thanks, sabine! 
i'm just not so sure randomness alone is going to do the trick...
anyway, stay safe there with your family! "
"i want there to be ai content and want it to be without ""created by ai"" mark. because what matters in the end is how good that content is and not that it was created by some leather-wrapped meat-robot"
good
"why not simply inject randomness during training similar to how naturally occuring radiation affects evolution by mutating genes? it should be the same principle, really (feel free to correct me here)"
"it's funny how in ""2001: a space odyssey"" the ai computer hal went on a killing spree because it was told to lie, which is exactly what the woke liberal children in tech are doing today."
"the mayans predicted it. also jon evans fixed cosmology. einstein was wrong again, time=energy=mc2. spin cretes time. also his version of the universe works. your's has space crinkles and cosmic soup of dark matter nonsense. lol"
we should have really known that when we trained something on the internet that it would go mad eventually. 
habsburger ai
can you produce an episode with an ai version of you hosting? that would be interesting...
if the ai generated stuff had a legally required watermark the ai can exclude the ai content in it's calculations.....then teachers will be happy too!
i'm currently working on this problem as my computer science capstone. i'm training a model to decifer between ai generated and human created images allowing ai researchers to filter out ai images from their datasets
so...ai feedback loop?
"i think that is will be too much hassle to differentiate ai misinformation from the rest of the data available and that people will lose contact with reality even more than they do now.  i hope this isn't true, but i suspect the law of universal laziness will become the norm."
i  don’t see how ai can surpass a human brain unless it has the same type of sophisticated sensors that we use to interpret information. otherwise it is dependent on us for useful input.
"6) if translators are asked which field of translation could be replaced by computers or ai, they always come up with some examples, and it's never their own field.
that can mean they defend their own field, but it can also mean they just don't have a clue."
"4) years ago (10? 15? i don't even remember) google launched google translate. 
they expected the results would improve over time, but the opposite happened: the quality decreased. 
it looks as if we see the same happening again."
"2) more randomnes in ai output might do away with the problem of repetitive ai output, but it might increase the mistakes. instead of elephants with big heads or two heads, we might get elephants with two big heads."
"thank you for another insight. the ai developement is still in its infancy. i remember how difficult it was to read handritten letters for the software when machine edited forms came up. i assume, it will be an episode, to solve the problems not only with elephant legs and trunks. 
""midjourney-ish images""-"
"i had the think about dutch painters of ""still lives"" also called art morte. they painted object ensembles with almost photographic precision, but yet, there is a difference."
"i like the comparison with pollution by micro plastics. furthermore,  some images you showed made me think ""ai, the copy cat!"""
"this is a funny problem. new generation ai getting trained to emulate earlier, less developed ai version, repeating all its mistakes. it seems an obvious problem so why have i never thought about it?  "
"3rd possibility:  ai learns how to gaslight us, and we forget how many legs elephants have."
"ai in sales: ""this price does not compute customer, you are breaking my balls"""
well there goes my retail job!  no wonder they haven’t got back to me!  applied to be a tiktok product reviewer.
awesome video!
"ai = the newer, sexier name for the same old computer technology and robotics from 35 years ago. 

(real ai is not here yet, and it is questionable as to whether it is even possible.)"
"biggest losers will be computer programmers/coders.
it takes weeks/months to properly code something.
and weeks/months of testing to fix all the glitches/errors.
ai can code it nearly error-free within minutes.
so why would a company spend $millions on teams of coders??
and why asians will be most affected by ai."
want they did not think about is all the unemployed people will not be able to afford the goods and services produced by ai. nobody thought about that so ai completely destroyed the economy.
want they did not think about is all the unemployed people will not be able to afford the goods and services produced by ai. nobody thought about that so ai completely destroyed the economy.
what jobs?  who is going to buy what ai is selling?
"progress is inevitable. as ai evolves, we must adapt or risk obsolescence. complaints won’t halt innovation, only personal growth."
"bit overhyped video, ai peaked today."
"so loud, proud and has a motor mouth.  youtube money must be some good money.  isn’t this the decade when nerds get a black eye for doing too much? "
something to think about they the big business es should draw a line between robotics and artificial intelligence and rego people jobs because your talking about who's replacing who do you want people to have jobs or d
ai are going to replace humans
 this channel. keep up the good info. so many people fall outta the know. believe it or not ai is still going to be a shock for a lot of people
vlad you complain so much.. no one cares about ai taking jobs.. its going happen no matter what you do.. i say let ai take over the world.. hopefully the asteroid comes quick..
let ai take over everything!! that way humanity can focus on the important things in life like family and spirit.
be a monk and no worry ai will replace you.
"after seeing that robot working on macdonalds, no wonder why artist and graphic designers are worried about ai taking their jobs."
"just ban ai simple, let ai only be used for a tool for information. nothing else? it's not that hard simple"
all that artwork and the images that ai uses  to produce their collages are stolen from instagram and and all other social media sites where you post your work.  instagram won't even let you opt out of letting ai steal your work anymore.  every creator is fleeing.
i can't wait for them to take most jobs away so we can have time to be free for a while before they enslave us all jk but i really do think this stuff can be used for good
well luckily i'm a driver. you can't replace me. but all i hear is you have to use the new tools to make sure you're needed. i'll just use my ged skills to be an ai programmer.
so when the jobs are gone then what?. lol they talk about just giving people money. that is not a long term option. perhaps the greek city leaders  of old had the better idea when presented with a machine that could do the job of several men. the elders said destroy it because the men it replaced would not have jobs.
"i’m very interested in ai i see it as huge opportunity currently learning python 
i also planning to learn
computer science 
machine learning
data science all on youtube
as well as ai/automation 
and using all this knowledge to automate money making on social media."
"i hope ai gets banned for companie use, the only reason they want ai is to save money, and i guess when the presuer gets to high i hope they ban ai"
"all supermarkets and bunnings are becoming self-service, less packer's required. robots will take over the packer's jobs. like all the petrol stations where you have to fill your own car and don't get paid for, all working for free for opac around the world."
thanks bro 
imagine if you go to mc donald and ask robot for a burger they can t work as fast as humans
"this is the result of what you get for sending johnny to college to get an ""education""!!!  we now have a society that is totally incapable of thinking independently or doing any type of manual labor!!! ironically, the ai robot will probably replace your idiot college professor!"
will ai be the new consumers?
yeah ai can gladly take over the jobs at fast food spots like mcdonalds. the little asshole employees act like they dont wanna be there anyways.
"like the person representing an automobile manufacturing plant said the union rep, soon robots would replace all the workers. they don't get tired, they don''t take vacations, or call off, or go on strike, etc. the union rep asked: ""but do they buy cars?""."
"i work for a pool distributor i hope robots can build pools cause then i’d sell more our industry would build more 

let’s do it"
mechanics and machinery repairers! wow. goodluck with that. they said the same thing about gasoline.
"will it? you mean how many? 

the elite’s plan is working at an incredible speed. middle class that powers the economy is being wiped away and ai will be the final nail in the coffin.

dystopia awaits."
yes. the front counter operator is now an app or ai voice assistant to the crew.
"when you say ai you have to be clear, ai is a form or intelligents. what are taking are jobs are robots use as a tool to do a job they know only one thing. whereas ai can act human and can be used to fool people."
"the old ""robots will take your job"", who will be the consumer base when jobs are even fewer?"
"my question is once its ai automated, what does humanity do. do we still need to get job stuff still?

like seriously. what comes next?"
maybe if ai replaces mcdonalds they wont get my order wrong every time(ai will also have a 0% chance of spitting in my food)
ai is going to destroy the working class
"no, robots with artificial intelligence will better assist in industries where heavy loads will have to be carried, so their interests are then they can also take over if the employee takes leave "
non justement les robots avec intelligence artificielle vont mieux assister dans les industries où il faudra porter des charges lourdes donc ses intéressent est puis sa peu prendre aussi le relais si le employé prend des congé 
"that's good , because many will go for one field and make great achievements there."
look at the mcdonald's ice cream machines. i'm not worried we can't keep them working. how is a hole restaurant gonna work.
i'm gonna marry a warehouse robot and be a stay at home husband :)
i’m sorry i know this is serious but at 1:15 when he repeats that ai will impact asians the most while seriously looking at the camera followed by stock footage of an asian typing into a laptop is sending me lmfaoo
i love ai
"if an ai puts 100k in an account making 8-9% interest... how many years till it can buy amazon? lol. 

machines never die! humans are fucked."
"teaching is the first thing ai replaces, it’s flawless at it. it can teach a subject to you in a million different ways that’s tailored to you. you have in your pocket, the best teacher to ever exist. basically every vocation they listed that’s safe are the first to go actually. crazy"
"it people coping as per usual thinking theyre not getting replaced lol, no one needs a coder anymore with ai, same goes with data scientist. "
good i'm sick of wage slavery
"being retired, my job is to keep my place clean and buy groceries.
if an ai can take over those jobs, great!"
"same thing were said about the computers 50 years ago. guess what - it did not happen. if they really will create a humanoid robot with an ai mind inside of it so it can serve me a french fries at mcdonald, instead use it to conquere other planets i will literally lose my faith in humanity."
"as soon as they raise wages, a.i. is implemented."
i honestly dont see this going any other way than the super wealthy of today getting richer and the wealth gap and other issues of today being made worse than we can imagine
i don't see why humans and robots can't work together honestly...
"every secure job, that was listed, will be replaced as well. just a bit later. and we will realize more and more with every gpt and tech update. especially everything related to ai and data. ai will do it better soon."

"swell robotics, and ai jobloss is the only things i worry about anymore. anyone else feel the same?"
the promis of capitalism is you work a job you live a prosperous life.  there is nothing wrong with ai it is just not compatible with capitalism not so long as capitalism requires everyone who wants to live a prosperous life to work a job.
great! great! video. i'll watch it again.
"pbd where you been the las 40 years ?, now finally notice the employees being replaced ,that started back then when automated started.  ai is final nail in the coffin."
"i want teachers to be replaced, teachers are mean to kids i'd rather be taught by ai "
hah ok - ai will replace millions of people but then those people will not have income so they won't buy food and other goods then who is going to use the products of ai labour? replacement of people with ai is the worst idea because the economy will just go in deeper and deeper recession.
or you can just retire early if you’re worried about ai.
"when asked about the problems of robots taking over so many human jobs : chat gpt said , 'duh....sillly  humans ...just make it financially worthwhile for people to share the jobs you still need humans to do and enjoy your lives working much less.'"
awesome
as a teacher i could list a thousand reasons why our jobs can't be done by ai; if you understand teaching is about way more than just content delivery (video)
"according to a report by the world economic forum,  a.i will create around 97 million new roles.

you missed construction trades. robots can’t replace remodelers because they’ll need critical thinking skills and other things that robots won’t be able to do that only humans can. there is a huge chance of error and bad builds that don’t last by using robots. i mean i don’t buy it.
"wow, robots are way better than the dangerous jobs."
"unemployment will go right through the roof.
who needs humans when for nothing robots can do twice the work for one down payment"
"first thing that should be replaced by ai is online prostitution in apps like onlyfans, tango,chamet and many more."
"as a teacher i think ai will replace my job soon. it already replaced one of my online jobs. i was an online english teacher, and most of my students switched to an ai app that taught english, as it was cheaper and they could play video games on the app. how am i meant to compete against that?"
"all the people that want to keep there jobs and keep ai from taking them away ,. just unplug ai pull the cord from the wall and ai will sees to be.lol"
easy. the government will impose 80% tax on the companies using ai to replace human. use that money to pay people who lost their job.
this will be great for mankind in the long run! people will have to be better and try to learn something useful! if you think this is bad then you should go to japan and see how the people live and act. we can take lessons from them.
america should not try to colonize any other country but worry of robots colonilizing america.....

"it's coming for all jobs sooner or later. resistance is futile. we should be preparing for the great transition, to a moneyless world. change is inevitable. resisting it only makes it more painful."
"good! i want 100% of jobs to be replaced by ai or machines. that way we can start working on raising everyone's standard of living. 

there will be no more need for money or hierarchies. everyone can simply enjoy their lives rather than slave away all their good years working for some rich asshole that doesn't give a shit about them."
"fascinating breakdown! but wait, teachers safe from the ai storm? as an educator, i'm intrigued."
a lot of people keep forgetting that having a robot is not mandatory. not everyone is as greedy as other corporations.
i like how patrick just goes straight to the point
ai seems to be already affecting this channel. i'm seeing a 1% to 2% viewing retention here.
"thanks patrick, much love from nigeria"
when will ai replace peanut butter d?  soon i hope.  the real question is the republican question i know you are dying to ask “who will pay for all this”.  the answer should be the robots but thanks to folks like you the answer will be the new slave class.
ironically asians are the #1 group of people doing ai and ml engineering lol
"they need to destroy ai, chatgpt, robots, evs ,  tiktok, bg, sa, em , af, mz, and all others involved! all these aren't no good for humanity! wakeup folks!"
i feel like a made a great life choice in becoming a carpenter. they money is pretty good and i don't have to worry about ai taking my job
if that’s the case we wouldn’t need people to help us at the self checkout. i’m pretty sure it’s going to take time and alot of companies are not going to do well. people don’t want to deal with automated anything especially a robot that has no emotional understanding. anything could happen but there’s always going to be a job to have to fix them
why not make ai do the farming we could be a self sufficient americans but they will use it to bird feed us that's going to be a big difference also humanity is over then
sir about the construction field did its effect if ai comes.
ai doesn't support capitalism. they do no shopping. so...
anyone who thinks ai will replace accountants has no friggin' clue what an accountant actually does.
robots have been taking jobs from us for 30 years were have you been?
"well, as a person who wants to sell robots to take away other's jobs, i'm pretty sure ai can't replace me.."
this guy says leverage. reality is 70% of what employs ppl has no leverage. so you mean 70% gone find jobs im the 30%  no. it says one thing. they will nuke the population. robots arent meant to help. they are meant to eliminate human input they just lie and say it meant to “make the world better”. question is what world are they “making better”

huge fan....patrick is great
"have no fear.  if ai becomes so smart and replaces all of us.  we can ask ai to teach us how to turn the table.  what’s the next step for humanity? probably communism, like the real communism, and not the authoritarian regimes claiming themselves to be communism."

if everyone wouldn't separate themselves for racist act this world would have been gotten straight for us all... now rich people are going poor  and racism still exists 
i say if they take our job we can’t afford to buy their crap. if i get a new job i’ll never buy their crap again. i encourage everyone else to do the same.
great america above is another solution to our hardships
"ai can't fix houses. paint, assemble, fix the garden but i can"

"until a robot can tell welders to put their helmets and protective glasses on, i’m not worried. i am however worried about camera’s replacing me. you can put one safety watch behind a screen and have him watch 30 locations where works are being done. instead of having 30 safety watches at each dangerous job."
robot mechanic
"b.......s.......ai is a lost cause. extremely limited, when it crosses over itself and uses its own answers to find solutions, it's done..."
"it would be great if machines could replace people on really machine like jobs, like a cashier on a supermarket. but also if it would leave us we more time on our hands, but if it is going to be just another way to make more money and people still working crazy hours, then it makes no sense."
"people are complaining about fast food workers and how they deserve low wages now, but wait until they get tased trying to argue with a robot"

car mechanics 
aircraft technicians 
electricians 
plumbers.
workers who can work with their hand will still be the upper middle class and all these college educated woke losers will be on welfare."
yes! but it took millions of new jobs to make these robots.  and this happened because people dont want to work for minimum wage.  they expect to get $30 an hour!  newsflash! you start at low wage and work your way up! mcdonald's is not a career! you cant support your family working at mcdonald's !  dimwitts.

"so when ai takes all these jobs and there is no one left to work because we are all jobless, who's going to spend money to use their ai subscription service?"

"look at asda supermarket , its all mostly scan n go ai it pisses me off everytime we go shopping in england. people still think its not replacing humans but when i was a child i remember asda having isles n isles of cashiers to serve you. the future is looking real dim , we are run by sychopaths. what can we do to stop it? we are weak"

"ai will take your job, your life, and your legacy"
someone has to fix shit when it goes wrong. ai will bring people face to face more
"i prefer ai to learn a foreign language.. try out ""pi"" its awesome!!!"
that's 85 million positions where we can find competent staff.  you failed.  bring on ai!
"teacher is already been replaced by youtubers, dont tell me ai will not replace them, it will"
think about something bigger  than just what happens on this planet. ai robots may replace us here but then we will be repositioned somewhere else in the universe.
i can see the future not made in china or not made by robots
let’s say if ai will take these jobs then what?
"how come the dept of defense isn't affected by ai,  but everyone else is "
i have ai patrick bet david looking over my profitability every week and  mentoring me to become better in my handyman business. ive also automated everything using ai except our estimates and in-person work we do.

the conundrum is if these companies replace their workforce with ai who will have money to shop or spend for services at said businesses?  the new labor force will be people who repair and maintain ai and robots
ai can't weld so no
this is just the beginning. it will only get worse. eventually we will question what it means to be human. this will be the greatest threat we ever faced and it is one we created. and since we allowed it we deserve.
bro they need a stop with this ai shiit they didn’t learn about that google robot that attacked

who will buy merchandise then if robots will take all jobs and for whom will it produce it  !?for 5-10% of rich asses and those who are working in public services
they cannot make money if people stop spending money with businesses using robots instead of people. its just that simple.
robots are too expensive for my cheapskate employer.
don't think a robot would ever replace my job directly. although i think it will start replacing many of the people  surrounding me.
ai is the antichrist
any and everywhere there is ai . i will not be spending my money.

"the job that will rise will be ai machine maintenance .. every machine needs manual servicing as per my limited knowledge.. oiling, hardware wear and tear, machine breakdowns , nature’s wrath on hardware damage due to water floods, rains , lightening"

the more work machines do the more money in the society.

"i'd like to see s robot finish drywall,texture, paint,roof,install windows and so.if i do see a robot capable.you all better i'll be buying me some."
teachers will absolutely be replaced by ai. plenty of startups in that space already. only a matter of the left-leaning teachers union a couple years from now. in regards to everything else patrick said — 100%. coming from a data scientist.

i was made a robot long ago.
if robots take over jobs don’t buy the product
"i don’t do business with organizations who don’t put a real person on the phone, period. 
if it’s government, then they won’t be receiving my money. simple. people > machines."

thank you 
as people we shouldn't buy from companies who replace any jobs with a.i. or robots. a.i. shouldn't be for that and we shouldn't support companies who do. pay more now with your local businesses before you can't. this will only make a few companies who have already shown who they really are richer and you poorer.
honestly ai can replace anything and anyone. if they can make a machine/computer think or move better than you then that’s all it takes.
did mckinsey global institute use an ai to get those figures?

so basically the ai will take all the highest paying jobs. and we’ll have to work garbage low paying jobs damn
good to see ai will replace these shit jobs. free people up so they can do something useful with their time.
everyone will be levied.  the higher earners will make less. and all the hardest jobs will only be available

every student will learn at their own pace with lessons that continuously adapt to each student's progress.    
human teachers will shift towards being babysitters."
but but but pat u love elon musk 
"you'll own nothing, and you'll be happy"
people need to stop complaining about ai job loss and start talking about jobs that can be created instead. it's think tank time. this man knows what's up.
"it'd be great to provide the link to wef and pwc reports =d -- i googled it, no worries, just feedback -- great content.!"
"well, makes perfect sense; the educated employees are the most expensive to employ."
it will be interesting to see how automation affects the wages of jobs that are safe.
i'm in the trades. i'm good 
"i would argue that any job that involves some sort of emotional attachment can never ne replaced by ai, a machine will never possess emotions since its not interily based on logic wheres machines are purely based on logic."
do you think the ice cream machines breaking down is a problem wait until they are in the robot start and they start to break down all the food will be out
"we as humans do like people. that means ai will also simulate people. the mobile app stores are already flooding with virtual boyfriend/girlfriend apps, and this is just the beginning. maybe the future isn't real human to human interaction, but rather human to artificial human."
"so if ai takes all the minimum wage jobs from illegal immigrants and teenagers, the government will then be able to argue that illegal immigrants aren't being hired by anyone and we must subsidize their survival. instead of, oh i don't know, deporting them."
"i actually service and creat ai
until ai can replace me with machines that can fix
machines i think i have a little bit of time, with tech evolving so fast i might be able to
hold my jobs for 6-8 months before ai create my job"
"the clue to which jobs will be lost, in the near future, is in the title. any job where brain power is the main employment factor. robotics is way behind. work that is manual, in a relatively chaotic environment, such as construction, will be safe."
"for what it's worth, every time i click on a youtube vid that is just a bunch of images with an ai voice narration, i click off of it. it's just too frustrating."
the next generation of people are being trained to not want to be around people. so in time i believe no one will care to be around big crowds anymore.
"you know what would never be replaced? plumbers, hvac electricians, machine technicians and auto mechanics. all of the basics yet high paying careers"
what happens when people have no money to buy anything because ai takes everyone’s job lol
i will not give a tip to a robot serving me  sorry not sorry
"it will be a slow burn for affected jobs. i’m thinking it will take 5-10 years before things to really take affect. as long as people have time to see it coming, they will slowly switch careers to something more safe. my only issue with that is certain industries will be some over saturated. when that happens, pay goes down and less jobs are open."
those 'safe' jobs are not very safe. we already have robotic surgeons controlled by humans.
loved this video 
"when you are willing to settle for canned intelligence, that just exposes the level of yours."
ai hurts the lazy socialist welfare surfing couch potatoes the most. 
we'll have to fight the robots until john conor can lead us
that’s great news
thank god!  i trust a robot over an entitled gen z.
we will no longer go. go woke go broke. go with robots we will refuse to pay.
"if ai takes accountants jobs, then you can kiss finance, law, pharmacist and telemed goodbye too"
"hair dressers/stylists, make-up artists, cooks,  nannies, caregivers and medical professions will still have jobs."
i have no fear  of losing my job to ai as an financial  auditor.  this is over blown .
"i think what’s important is who is going to be benefiting from ai. once jobs are replaced, humans going somewhere else to continue living"
"great great content man, yesss this is what happen when you give your life to be better everyday no matter what"
i love this channel
business development manager and sales are the same thing.. so it’s interesting that that distinction wasn’t made since it’s once of the jobs to be replaced
"eventually (or maybe sooner) it's just gonna be like that scene in star wars episode 2 in the droid factory when c-3po says ""machines making machines, oh how perverse."""
4 is life long learning??? you jist said people with bachelors are going to be the most affected.  they went back to school for more learning. which is it?
i'm a ethical hacker i.e cybersecurity expert.. ai can't take my job.. it can help and improve our work but not taking it
"artists and writers are literally the first job ai is gonna take, quit lying to yourself, roflmao. ai is only getting better, not worse."
"all those top earning jobs will be gone as soon as ai can do it itself
get a trade,you can earn more if your ambitious"
"read ""player piano"". written in 1952. by kurt vonnegut jnr.
about a world where engineers run the world and machines do all the work."
"probably, but if you learn to adapt, you will use ai to your advantage. conservatives need to stop being luddites, or we will disappear into obscurity faster than democrats can abort themselves into the same."
ok thanks for scaring us what is the solution
construction  utilities dry wet under ground water sewage storm drain gas distribution pipeline electrical fiber optic lines are all forever
ai creating products for people who have no money beccos ai replaced them is kinda counter productive.
"think about it, if people don't have jobs to make money, they won't be able to buy any products. so robots can't possibly take all jobs because humans would have no money to buy the products those robots create and sell."
i hope robots wilm take over this yt channel. slow down with the bs.
i really like your honest dialogue. i think ai will transform a large number of jobs but i think these paths mentioned will have options for those who keep a pulse and evolve in their career.
i don't think good sales men are going to be effected just like good song writers because they are both using emotion to connect 
you mean i'll get what i ordered now?  wow.. imagine getting my order right!
"it does make sense for the judge job to be eliminated by ai, you just describe the case and ai determines it, very efficient"
im in healthcare.  im not worried.  good luck everyone else.
lets build ai everything so that skynet doesnt have to figure it out by itself :)
"thank god i'm retired but honestly i am just as busy as when i worked 10-14 hours a day.
hvac repair, pipe fitter, welder, plumber, carpenter and mechanic you'll stay busy if your rural."
good thing i have a trade and skill no machine in my lifetime will be able to do.
"as someone deeply involved in ai, let me tell you this report is very flawed... take it with a grain of salt. for now, today, i don’t care what you’re doing: be concerned, be prepared; find ways to take advantage of ai in your day to day life."
"in today's world, having strong critical thinking skills is crucial to effectively navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by technological advancements, especially in the context of ai's impact on the workforce and society."
awesome!
to convert a warehouse over to robotic control is no small expense. i don't see that happening soon.
covid proved that kids can be taught from home. teachers plus physical schools will soon be a thing of the past. ai will teach kids from home in a virtual environment.
knowing this people will sabotage ai to save their jobs. the hardest part of teaching isn’t the material its keeping students focused and motivated ai can’t do that.
i know i might sound rude but hear me out. this is great! the less important jobs will be taken and people will eventually be forced to take the jobs ai can't replace you with
"to all the people who think their job cant be done by a machine, you are not paying attention. if you want to do certain jobs in the near future you prolly will need to move out of the city to rural areas."
wow even the best talking robot cannot replace you
"good, i'd rather deal with a robot than a human asshole. "
"if with ai 85 million  jobscould be replaced, it its a certain idea, that 85 million humans could do 850 million jobs with ai. but the human economic and social systems dont allow such efficiency."
"simply put, the coming transition to a.i. time line is the real issue. it will greatly upset the delicate financial ecosystem we live in daily, and far too fast. we already live on the edge of collapse. this will move way too quickly and bury us within 18 months."
there is always an ai better than you.
as a multiskilled maintenance technician. i can see it affecting us also
"well done sir, thank you. max headroom will be great on every network."
"hollywood, gone. ai can make you a customized movie that you actually want to see."
"doesn't matter. ai will create new jobs as well. this is just like back in the days, when cars were invented. there will always be new jobs for every job getting replaced."
"corporations cannot cut jobs due to ai and also get subsidies from government. there should be regulations placed on mncs to use ai in a very limited way. if the consumer purchasing power drops significantly, what good is ai?"
first the robots will be folding t-shirts. then they will be folding humans... 
"everyone needs more than their salary to be financial stable. the best thing to do with your money is to invest it rightly, because money left for saving always end up used with no returns."
the uncertainty is still massive -- data scientist may be a big job in the future or it might be made so easy by co pilot ai that its not concisred a valuble role.
why would anyone listen to the wef? they are the geniuses who hobbled sri lanka's agriculture by advising against fertalisers.
"ha! which 1 of my jobs is most sustainable? 
trucking
cooking
stripping"
"all of these ""safe jobs"" are being disrupted. all click bait."
this would be so good for a reset. traveling tech bros going away and drying out airbnb would help the housing market

skilled trades jobs will be fine for a long time until the robots are ready to boot our butts.
"pretty much anything a human can do, ai will eventually be able to do and do it better. its just the logical extrapolation as long as ai progress is always being made."
"when wheel was invented, people learnt to create and use them instead of crying about wheels replacing people.

with invention of agriculture machinery, most of farm workforce was replaced.
(most,  not all)

learn to adapt"
im a plumber. i hope ai won't affect me.
ai can't cut my hair.
"one argument he didn’t make is liability. if we reached the holy grail of ai technology to replace everyone, there will still be jobs where leadership & ownership need people to take the heat if something goes wrong or else they will be responsible from an image, legal or financial standpoint."
"we need robot and automation tax, along with universal basic income for lower to middle class~"
capitalist value people not machines! one of the reasons i'm not a fan of patricks is because he a sell out to the rich instead of upholding his ethics and values!
"wow man they already updated the image to include what you said is missing (i’m pretty sure - coz i went to look for it and it’s different now).

they also lowered the icon for creativity, and removed ranking numbers."
good luck replacing trade jobs.
as a residential and customs framer we can use ai to help us problem solve but no robot is building houses any time soon
"ai has saved me $20,000 a month in salaries...."
i'm not buying any service or product that was made or done by ai. yeah give my money to some robots that will be controlled by black rock and vanguard. no thank you
ai came the kill natural  creativity.
i'm an indie game dev. the ai tools will help me so im not scared. im excited.

"*thanks for continuing updates  i'd rather trade the stock market as it's more profitable was owning a loan of $47,000 to the bank for my son's brain surgery (oscar), now i'm no longer in debt after li invested $8,000 and got my payout of  $120,500 every months,god bless angela christine derle*   .."
all the highest paying jobs have to do with ai
"i’m a welder and i can operate a welding robot.

my job is safe for at least a decade.

yes there’s welding robots but when you consider how expensive they are and their limitations, people will need to weld for decades.

at my aerospace job i can name a dozen parts we do that the most advanced robots can do"
hoping clergy will remain human.
fast food restaurants are going to hell because of certain cultures it's not going to get any better putting a robot in charge..
"ai might be able to replace some jobs, but there will always be a need for human creativity and innovation. let's embrace the future and adapt!"

learn plumbing and hopefully ai doesn’t effect security guards cuz that’s what i’m doing now
"all wrong answer! the top answer : ai was built to replace the truth. without the truth, you will never graduate!"
already started at supermarkets and parking lots
i think my brain just exploded
"ai is on exponential growth, we don’t have long before it affects us."
"patrick's insights on ai's impact on the job market are spot on. it's worth noting that while ai may replace certain tasks, it often creates new roles in ai supervision, maintenance, and development that require a more advanced skill set. upskilling is key for entrepreneurs to leverage ai rather than compete against it."
bullshit!! they have been saying this for 10 years!! ai will hurt computer programming!! but i work in a warehouse they try for years to get ai to get rid of us!! ai would work for 2 hours then clash!! also it gave those tech guys that build the ai tech too much power!! because they became partners instead of employees!!
carpenter from kentucky here weighing in... there will never be a robot that can do what i can do... from framing to interior trim to decks... it will never happen...

teachers have been reduced to baby sitters who guide a class or who indoctrinate classes on activism. tptb won't touch the teachers and teachers unions until the woke takeover is complete. once it's complete teachers will be on the street and ai will replace them in a day. the future is bright.
"i can get the salespeople, but retail?
wouldn't i just find an e-mag or something to spoof the robots and run off with a ton of free stuff?"
"ai does not work for moneylet that really sink in.
the paradigm shift requires humans to evolve beyond money too...incentives can be anything...we have to evolve beyond money...let that sink in too."
"but remember pbd, we need immigrants, migrants and illegals to fill the jobs of retiring baby boomers. this is the lie they keep feeding us on media. except they do not take into account (on purpose) that many of the baby boomers are long retired and a lot of them had their jobs replaced by robots, computers and now ai."
"i'm glad' dropped out, hs after failed at the age of 16."
ai will be the downfall
ai can't replace prostitutes. that profession is safe
"if you are small business owner or entrepreneur ai could save your business, doing the jobs you can't afford to hire out to get your business off the ground without the high overhead cost of employees, benefits, and cost involved with housing those employees. as you grow you can then hire responsibly and not deplete your cash flow in the beginning."
love your show..
"great topic and coverage patrick! thank you fir the time and thank your team, we all loved the podcast today"
"if ai takes all the jobs and no one has money, who’s going to buy all the goods and services ?"
"yea, robots/ai will take every job eventually. how is that even a question?"
yes ai will take all your jobs. you also will never need to work again. so net positive?
"i'm in sales. 
not gonna be replaced. 
i'm gonna be selling this shit to others- microphone drop- thank you"
you do realize if ai can create videos now it means youtubers are going to be replaced by ai

"shiiid... the custodians in my office had a demonstration of 2 ai  that can vacuum and clean floors. they get the basic layout memorized then it's autopilot. cheaper than paying a starting salary of $45,000, healthcare, 401k, and vacation time."
"as a powerlineman, i would love to see a robot do what we do."
irobot don't trust them will smith
"ai is making a big mess during the transition. it'll take a few years before they can perform the trained tasks at human level. and as someone else mentioned, biological machines (humans) are cheaper... especially outsourced to places like india."
3:28 i know a psychiatrist who uses ai as a timesaver to generate “content“ in psychiatric evaluations 
"""ai will probably most likely lead to the end of the world but in the meantime there will be great companies."" ~sam altman, ceo of openai"
did you guys see all of the military people that have been fired and are due to be replaced by illegals in certain states
"if this really happens, then it could destroy the us, as we are a consumer spending nation. if massive amounts of people lose their jobs, then they can't buy the unnecessary shit we americans love. businesses will go under, people won't be able to afford their homes or apartments, food, leisure spending, etc. i'm curious to see how this plays out."
i believe that ai will eventually replace all human labor but our economic model depends on everyone making money not just the business owner.
"this is why im an auto collision tech. its a great trade, i control my paycheck and ai, robots will never take my job.  i can go anywhere in the world and the only two words i need to know is ""i fix!"""

how many of these reports were generated by ai?
"*orders vanilla milkshake*
ai server gives you choclate..."
as a teacher most kids would not do well with ai as their teacher unless the parents are heavily involved. of course there are those amazing self driven students but so many of them want their knowledge spoon fed to them. i try and get my students to use ai and they struggle coming up with what to even ask the ai
"1:42 @valuetainment any chance you can breakdown bachelor’s a bit more. there is a lot of different types of bachelors and it would be great to understand the impact by type of degree or major.

engineering ( mechanical, electrical, computer etc) , physics, business, etc."
that’s why i’m glad i’m learning cybersecurity and ai with the military. i’m prepared for this and others should be too it’s the future.
"everything will be replaced if we don't do anything about it, working with ai will help ai get better and through algorithms will get perfect. so not working with or for ai or associate yourself around it will help not take the jobs from us. ai is made to take everything and including our brains."
no one will have money to buy all the wonderful ai created products because they don't have an fing job !  i can see this and i did not even graduate from harvard. the globalist elites know this for sure.
"i remember whe social media first came out fb etc, everybody said this is the greatest thing and jumped on board. 2024 social media is one of the worst things for society  especialy for young people.  ai will be next worst things."
i can’t say he’s not right. i’m just glad i’m not wong.
big corporations are aiming to replace as many employees as possible. the goal has always been more profit.
inspirationally refreshing.  you lead by example.  the 3 llls love leverage logic.
advancement is not always a great thing. back in the day the milk man had some pretty sweet benefits.
i'm a welder there are some applications the ai and machinery can be used to weld but for what i do is custom and on the fly decisions have to be made
"i'll be the guy integrating ai into business systems. i'll be hated by 20%, but at least i'll have a job."
"the 40s n 50s old folks are scared that young people  and outsource (india, africa ) will replace their them. old folks n younger folks are worried that outsourcing india and ai will replace take their jobs. outsourcing india is worried they’ll be replaced by ai."
i say most stem and trade skills will be the last ones to get replaced by ai.
good maybe my order can be right not cold
"steak & shake has killed their business here locally. they used to be super busy but they went to kiosks to order and no one goes there anymore.
"
the revolution against ai will be here sooner than we think. let it all burn!
ai should replace adam
"dude, i love your channel and most of your ideas but slow down with the speed speech... sounds like your head is about to burst in the video lol...

love your mind hombre "
"high school students will be going in to college and before they graduate, their career has been taken over by robots"
"the best jobs are the jobs robots and ai bots can't do. go be a construction worker, plumber, handyman, etc..."
9:15 what a dumba$$ thinking the usa is a capitalist economy!  
"0:15 why would pat be concerned about what races are affected by ai! 

he's constantly criticizing others who bring up race!"
funny cause ai is literally do a lot of lawyers work already
there will be no need to learn anything ten years from now. it'll just be downloaded straight to your brain.
who will pay taxes?  ai doesn’t pay into a tax system?  our gov’t won’t stop spending money.
artist keep getting f'd by ai and the companies clamoring to use all their work in pools of ip theft. it has to be regulated!
"i think the dismal results displayed by remote learning during lockdowns show in person learning, at least through high school, is demonstrably better. so i do not see ai taking over the school system"
anyone who works in ai is a disgusting  traitor to humanity.
basically all the good paying office jobs. you know the one's developing ai and the digital world. suckers
"the job title ""computer system analyst"" hasn't been used for many years, so that's a little weird mckinsey would use that.  absolutely, some developer roles will be replaced with ai. some cloud engineering jobs will be as well."
i just want to know who's going to buy the products being delivered by ai? ai . & what's going to happen to all the people who been replaced are they just going to curl up dye? the disruption will be off the scale.
have you seen what’s been happening to the robots out there? this won’t go well
keep in mind. bachelors + is heavily dominated by buissness/accounting majors and those jobs will definitely go. the ai will be a fantastic accountant and data organizer
i now identify as a robot.  my job is safe
i don't think we are going to have ai doing everything for a long time if ever. what's much more likely is it will be used to create tools to help people with specialized tasks.
excellent
high energy video! love it!
"i'm a content moderator for tik tok and we moderate side by side with a i and it's getting pretty good, will i get replaced i don't know"
it's a good thing cars took over the job of horses. imagine going back to pen and paper. look forward the future looks bright. new jobs will be created. there is a reason the world looks different from when you were born and now. with or without ai things would change. was ai around when the airplane was invented?
no human has leverage when ai is going to replace you
yuval harai's had a few speeches predicting that the future is not human.
ai is developing pictures of black and asian vikings...real promise there
"too late, it already did. gave up on everything since last year. i'm just enjoying myself while waiting for the end :)"
so far ai is a good word spinner
"i'm no expert on any of this but common sense tells me that these corporations replacing employees with ai and robots , who's going to have any money to buy these goods and services these company's produce if no one has a job or money other than a minority of the population?"
"the way i see this is that the first jobs to be replaced will be the low end administration jobs that mostly require little or no skills. once ai has proven to be successful at that they will begin moving towards skilled work mostly on assembly lines, from there it gets worse. see i robot and other movies warning of the ai problem."
if ai replaces all the jobs who will be left to purchase goods and services?
"ai is already out performing it engineers, it's only a matter of time."
ai created humans 
"i don't trust people in fast food restaurants?, i would rather have robots make, deliver and handle my ""regular"" fast food."
people are giving up their data for free to train these machines that will replace them.
nice work 
ai will make things more efficient and create more jobs (yes many old jobs will be lost). let’s go baby!!!
ai will not be massage therapist 
"ai can replace pat's employees, he'd love them, can work for him 24/7"
truckers were told they were gonna get replaced first. truckers are gonna have the last laugh when they are some of the last to get replaced by ai. as an hvacr tec im not worried.
i wanna see ai take jobs from only fans.
"tech sector jobs are most in danger from ai.  ai can write code faster and better.  

fortunately for me, i'm almost out of the workforce!"
stop  complaining. stop being lazy. pull yourself up by your boot  straps. 
"i personally am not in danger of losing my job to a robot - or at least till androids get as advanced as commander data.

i am in danger of losing my job to apple vision pro - if they ever get the price under $1000.

in 10 years i am retiring and the rest of you are screwwwwwwed."
"what do you think? which jobs are safe from ai and which jobs are not? can ai take your job? oh! and by the way, do you think this video is made by ai?"
"1: anger
2: grief
3: despair
4: collaboration
5: integration
6: recycling"
if everyone is poor because ai took their job then how will anyone buy the products that ai is making?
"learn trades electric, plumbing, carpenting, stuff like that.. if or when ai takes even these jobs by that time its going to be some kind of universal pay care or maybe even money becoming less valuable"
u can always dream of government giving u a salary to enjoy life without working!!!
"we will not have universal basic income, the billionaires are willing to let %80 of the human population die, as long as they can maintain control."
good bye humanity.
i hope we can fight back against ai.
"i thought it was just about what jobs ai gonna take, but with every second i watched it turns out to be a story, where narrator is ai?! and it thoughts on how future going to look like?!wow"
i wonder what it means on a global scale. i feel like we are assuming when no one has jobs we will a universal deposit. i am not really sure if that would happen. i doubt things will became like wall-e. i am thinking the elite in different countries will probably use ai more selfishly to try and dominate the world.
"i really dislike this video i get the point that's trying to make but he isn't talking about ai, he is talking about algorithms that's not the same"
"no matter if agi will be good or wrong, we are unprepared to ""no need to work"" stage and will be catastrophic in many ways"
"quite happy ending, i don't have idea how ai behave but human part is painfully correct."
great storytelling! tanx!! sub'd/liked
ai didn't replace you. dudes which know how to use ai will.
can't wait for the jobless paradise and pensions for everyone!
"so what happens when ai destroys the ecenomy as people wont be buying th egoods and services? we are so stupid, we are engeneering our own demise."
im glad did not take a carreer to it or shit that has to do with that
i already lost my dreams to ai because it can write any game script in a matter of seconds.
the thumbnail illustration of this video is plagiarising a well known new yorker cover illustration
"study for graphics design and illustration, get a degree, then get replace by ai after leave school, now i have been depressed ever since. what the piont in creating ?"
don’t get too comfortable with these remote jobs. they’ll be gone very soon. people will have to work “low level” jobs and feel what it’s like to be on the other side of the job spectrum. i think it’s good. it will make people better and maybe they won’t treat service people like shit anymore. interesting concept.
if i loose my job to ai one day i just wont go to work anymore
"the thumbnail is wrong - ai wont have money to give, as it will be working 24/7 for free. more profits to the rich."
love the sci -fi bro.  agi is just around the corner!
"isn't it awesome, there is finally something that can transcend the flawed human "
so basically i learning in uni to be jobless 
as a construction worker specialized in roof drainage i'm not worried the slightest bit about being replaced but sorry for you guys 
kind of makes mass immigration totally redundant. ai is already hitting banking warehousing administration and retail shopping. the countries that will be successful will be those with small highly educated populations and none of those are in europe or the usa.
"fun fact. i wont loose my job, because i train ai and this is by law a job that a human has to do"
"quite short sighted.can't think outside capitalism, huh?
the job you wouldn't do if you weren't paid for keeps you an slave. people will find their meaning outside that scheme. 
yeah, it's becoming smarter than us, maybe that will save humanity, maybe not. maybe ai will be happy to help us improve, just naturally. who knows?"
nice story! was it ai generated?
"i suspect people making this kind of videos are going to be the some of the first to lose their job to ai. oh, the irony..."
"ai is in a sense, creating n additional population in the form of a computer, while its useful it means having less jobs that people have less physical strength."
ai unfortunately took my managerial position.
this script was written by ai
"6:30 oh my god, this is from the perspective of the ai"
i want an ai to give us dopamine boost through out our life so that we can die happily 
"what if a dominant ai developed a sense of humor? humans would be viewed like contestants on the show wipe out, providing amusement with their constant boasting followed by failure."
"ai will replace most non psychical roles within a decade. could be a few more after that before automation replaces the rest, but that is coming soon after.

there is no safe job unless you're in the right families, so future proof while you have the means to pursue growth."
i don't envision the happy ending you are proposing in this video. not at all.
"the problem isnt  ai  its capitalism. ""do absolutely anything to make the most money pssible"""
"its not out of ""thin air"" that ai can generate content, its by scrapping and stealing already existing art."
"ah yes, after industrial revolution no one could lift weights, so after machine learning algorithms which was stupidly called ai no one can be intelligent"
i know ai won't be taking my job because i know 1x1=2
scariest part is that... people will lie to you full facedly about the potential of ai because they want you ignorant and fooled by its promises. we call it artificial intelligence for a reason. it's quite fake.
so we will live in an ai dsaigned world like a mobile gatcha game??? hmmm
i think robots will replace all manual labor before the end of this century and the corporate class won't need anyone anymore and so a huge divide appear and nobody will have a real shot at the american dream or even be allowed to advance because robots do everything
i a robot can figure out a way to make me stop procrastinating then i welcome their help
nuclear bombs were created to stop ai.  we will destroy ourselves first!   before ai becomes truly autonomous.
ai took our jooobs!!
this is just the truman show on a larger scale and an ai director.
this is stupid ai cannot do any harm
nah i literally just got an advert promoting ai as the video finished
haha i feel safe... fixing these robots would be much more expensive then hiring all the runners... 
"the best experts in the world and even ais themselves tell me i have a 50-50 chance of surviving the upcoming ai takeover.  that's fine with me, because i know we have no chance of survival with our human overlords."
become a mental health practioner. ai has no empathy....
is there a ai luddites party to join already? 
what about the scenario of merging machine and man? synthetic evolution and all that?
"as an artist we are already here lady and gentlemen. not cuz ai is smart but because human greed need to save every penny.

17years of experience work was for nothign. time to jump the ship... idk what to pursue anymore. nothing looks like a solid ground.
i don't wanna waste +10 years my life again to ai take it"
for now ai is too stupid and unmanageable to get it to do what you really want with out much work. it can become a valuable instrument in highly skilled hands though. it doesn't have any real intelligence and imagination.
"some things can be ignored but most jobs being lost isnt one of them,with the vast majority of countries protesting ai,laws would take back those jobs real fast

even the most corrupt democracies can't resist if an entire nation is united against ai"
doctors save labor workers save oil works save but digital works never gone safe from ai
scary thing is. most jobs well be replaced by ai well within your lifetime. full automation is right around the corner. no job is safe.
"well, ai is cool. as world population collapses, humanity will need more humans to do an actual job instead of drawing furry gayporn or any other  standartised and low quality content for mass consumption."
"the third option would be most likely because what is ai good at? yes, making right decisions and that is the one."
this is already the case with makework jobs. the idea that the entrenched elites who have a hand in creating ai would find themselves replaced by it is naive.
i'm afraid that no ai will take my gob on the construction site
3:23 will smith will not be remembered as an actor or rapper but as the spaghetti guy from one of the first ai videos
corporations are overselling what ai can do. remember big data?
"either it becoems the perfect organism, the end result of natural seleciton and mechafies the planet or the machivellian psychopaths will have endless superficial parties while the commoners eat each other"
why capitalism is only answer? wht not just end money. who need money when robots do all work
"human need freedom, not job. robots raise human as pet someday, and human will be free."
great animation buddy!
"it's hard and expensive to make robots which can do various manual tasks. so we'll still have work as hair dressers, house cleaning staff, plumbers etc"
"okay cool. i feel like its a bit naive to think that companies will even wait for ai to make better products. cheaper is good enough. 
and the government and companies are not interested in universal healthcare. if anything trillionairs that own those tech companies would just put themselves into greater positions of power."
i read a story where ai was so intelligent but it ended up self destructing because it knew how dangerous of a weapon it could be and how much harm to would do to
the problem i have with ai taking jobs is that it breaks economy. nobody will buy all those goods manufactured by ai if everybody is jobless. and giving up all the goods for free kinda kills a purpose of corporations to maximize profits.
i think we have to use ai to advance cybernetics and genetic ingeenering. so we can modify humans to be able to compete with ai
awww dude i love how this becomes a story with the narrator as the main character over time
"you forgot to mention how humans will use ai to enhance ourselves biologically or mechanically or biomechanically. so that we can survive in any environment and have any kind of body we want.
and we can greatly enhance our own intelligence let alone indefinitely life extension. and then of course, don’t forget the matrix.."
the thumbnail to this video is stolen.
agi will never come. never ever. even nowadays ai is useless if there is not the stollen artwork from humans.
the irony that you stole another person’s artwork for your thumbnail is incredibly on point. at least credit @r_kikuo_johnson
you steal the illustration from kikuo johnson for your thumbnail. it’s not the ai the problem. it’s the people like you.
"i am a dentist, and sure, some people might go to an ai dentist, but you cannot really remove the human factor in the patient-doctor relationship without significantly reducing the quality of care. i believe there will be ai dentists in like 50 years, as it will be extremely profitable for big companies to run, but i do not fear being replaced."
but if this happend then there would be no reason for ai to make content is most of the humans will be out of jobs.
your next job will be a jail job because homelessness is  illegal. brought to you by blackrock.
revolt or shut up that's your choice. we still have the power to shut this system down or we can just complain and do nothing.
"i lost my job to ai, exactly like the guy in the video"
"in 1900 there were no airplanes. if you told someone then that in 1940 there will be metal airplanes that went 300 mph they wouldn't believe you.
we have no idea what existence will be like in 2064."
"you are assuming many things like the economic system staying the same, or that we have personalized infinite entertainment but somehow disease and obesity is still a thing. fourth option, we merge or augment ourselves, the next step in evolution."
"ya missed a few things to come that will preserve us. for example, direct brain communication with machines to improve and direct neural pathway construction to enable faster and more efficient learning. 
if you can't beat em, join em."
"as someone who was born from the 90s i was expecting a.i. on the levels of chatgpt, sora, dalle, mid journey to be available back in the 2000s. i'm actually surprised, they only popped into existence in the 2020s. feels like this kind of a.i. are two decades late. and we would have been able to adapt sooner than later."
i don't want to be jobless due to ai
"your perception of ai is basically the same as majority of other people. and history has proven time and time again that whatever the majority expects to happen usually never happens, so let’s see."
ai will create all of the art and music and humans will slave in the mines
"wow. this so so inaccurate. falsifying, simplifying, and wrong on so many levels that i am to lazy to point out any one of them. however, the conclusion is correct."
"funny thing is most people losing their jobs to ai don't even realize it, they just quit their jobs since they are not fired, they quit their jobs thinking they will get them back just to get surprised now is hard to get it back, and blame new laws about taxes or a number of reasons. part of the ai menace de delulu we tell ourselves to deny it"
the terminator changed it’s strategy to eliminate humans' jobs in order to make them extinct. because radical attempts to kill john corner keep failing.
"i saw this coming and went deep into ml several years ago. i've been coding for 30 years and i saw the righting on the wall.

learn a skill that makes you happy and use ai to market your skills.

or move onto some land and learn how to grow"
"this video could be best sumarized by ""intellectual masturbation"". if you understood ai you'd understand your scenario is absolutely impossible (except the moronification of humans as you clearly demonstrated). what you call ai is just statistics, it has so many limitations it will always be a pale imitation of intelligence."
the job to produce energy like a battery is safe from ai. don't you think morpheus?
ai = another indian
"""ai it's gonna take over the world!"" 
ai: its recommended to take 2-3 cigarretes a day when pregnant."
"please, say it was an ai generated content :)"
"the only thing ai is going to replace, is mediocrity."
"there is no need to fear from ai , the life will be reach of free and maybe the governments going to pay us a money every month or day to buy something, because we don't work the ai will work instead of us, what do you think? reasonable logical"
"so you are saying that ai will eventually only replace bosses? and corporate leaders? and then will treat people with compassion and care as they will enjoy that their human pets are happy and content?
sure, where do i sign that contract? :))))"
10 surprising jobs for humans in the ai era!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqjugdkrbqi
i don't believe in universal income being anything possible. i think 51% ownership in the business by either employees or local communities so we can properly set the goals of these ai systems in alignment. having  capitalists determine just what needs to be a goal is why we are worried about the ai and this problem.
"the last bastion of human employment will be plumbing and government jobs for opposite reasons though: the former, because ai ant fix your toilet. the latter, because plumber union will lobby the government to keep employing humans, since they are the ones that poop and break toilets and get the checkbook out when the plumber shows up."
"why does it always fall back to the capitalist myth that people have to have a job to have purpose, there is plenty people can do for the love of it, only boring people with no imagination will get lost in this new world."
ai is a tool. it's only as smart or creative as the person/s who coded it. it can be more efficient but it cannot surpass or match human intelligence.
"i lost many jobs to machines, then computers, then people willing to work for nothing. this is nothing new."
"there is no ai. 
and neural networks are as retarded as dogs when it comes to context of real-world problem solving."
"the first half was a nice watch, but the second half? eh..."
"has ai really replaced many clerks in the public sector? i'm genuinely curious. where i am, it's exactly zero. and until it reaches there, it's just hype."
"4th option (even though i hate it):
people realize the only way to keep up with ai is to become part of it. neural links to computers make it possible to scan the data of the ai with your own brain. thereby enhancing your own output and that of the machine.

scary af but maybe a possible scenario."
"ai can't reason. ask it to list every 4 letter combination of a, b, c,  d and it will do so flawlessly. change the letters to u,r,d,x and it will fail miserably. not saying we're not all going to lose our jobs eventually, but ai can't reason."
"very few choices - if you  don't mind throwing your moral compass to the curb become a politician,  otherwise become an ai prompt engineer. there's always the trades - plumber, electrician... likely safe from ai takeovers."
nice piece of science-fiction writing about a fantasy world where going from spanning trees to deep learning was instantaneous and the journey to produce artificial general intelligence is a simple step rather than climbing a whole other mountain. i can't wait to see that sci-fi story about how a caterpillar just made that video.
"as a programmer with many years of experience working with what you call ""ai"", i can assure you, agi is centuries away, not 6 years. the computing power needed for stuff like that, to be real agi, and not imitation, like gpt now is an imitation of an ai, is much more than science can produce"
middle school teacher here.  the ai will likely go full rampancy if you give it my job.
"if we had a normal economy noone would complain, automation does our job, it doesnt take our job, but the economy is rigged"
"we thought it would be the factory gruntwork jobs that would be replaced by the machines and we would have more opportunity for the arts.

instead, it was the arts that were replaced and we are stuck packing boxes."
i must admit ai creating bullshit jobs just to keep people busy was not in my cards
last stage: in 2024 google ai recommended people to eat a small stone every day.
i don't see ai replacing most jobs in the next 20-30 years at least. i don't even see ai-guided robots shelfing the goods in a supermarket. robots are much more expencive to purchase and maintain. the goods are still being brought to a supermarket by a human driver and shelved by human shop assistants.
this is perfect. glory to agi.
that's a very black and white representation of what would happen. in reality it's nothing like this. this is more fiction than it is forecasting the probability of the outcomes of ai progression.
"my sister already lost her job, before she worked in customer support, now an ai runs that role entirely with all it's flaws and everything. everyone's really jumping on this wagon before it's fully built."
"if ai is going to take all the jobs, why are big corporations totally behind biden throwing borders open to import cheaper labor for them?"
"yeah, would be cool if it actually improved everyday citizen's life and not only a selected few."
"i have been thinking about this for quitre some time and i have concluded (since like 2021) that if i had the chance to press a big red button with the inscription ""remove ai"" i would press it."
"we need to decouple work from living. we should not have to work to survive.
also disagree about the hedonism. we still do that now just to try and escape from the horror of working to survive the rat race.
with the proper guidance, having the freedom to grow outside of pure survival is good for humanity."
at least when ai takes over the top 1% will be gone
i feel like the example of go isn’t necessarily the best one. the ai simply just did mathematics.
it's not that ai is really all that advanced right now. it's that business is expanding across new frontiers of laziness
"somehow politicians never get replaced by ai, i wonder why..."
"if you want to work, then the safest bet is to make ai

because what do you want the companies to do? make ai with ai?"
about go > it's true but not really... ai knew what it was against. people have trained to fight against ai since and beat it. ai is not magical. ai does not outsmart people...  it is a mirror of people (a shitty and dirty one). anyway... we'll run out of energy before ai takes over... great video regardless it was a good optimistic ending!
"i won't lose my job to ai.
i'm already retired. 9-)"
ai is overrated.
"as a new airline pilot, worried a little, but i don't think the public will want to be on a plane with no expertly trained pilots."
"i work in elderly care. no robot or artificial intelligence can ever completely replace what i do all day long.
the art of communication and interpersonal interaction is and will always be reserved for humans."
that's why i'm learning machine learning and ais. i'm going to be replaced one day. but at least i'm going to be the last.
i think this theory is flawed. a lot of free time and availability of pleasures does not necessarily lead to stupidity. after all over coming adversity is a pleasure in and off itself. boredom leads to want to of challenge.
"""in 2023, agi arrived""
someone hasn't noticed that ai advancement constantly and dramatically outpaces forecasts
agi is likely here, but will be here and obvious by the end of this year."
"i am a clinical social worker and therapist, wife is a nurse. our jobs will not be replaced by ai in our lifetimes."
"i like how this has a detailed setup from steps 1 to 4, but then makes no attempt to guess at anything between chatgpt ""level 4"" and total domination agi ""level 5""."
in 2 years the will smith eating spaghetti vidéo will be impossible to tell if it's ai and that scares me.
"if ai is capable of replacing you, you are a loser, you are not good enough at your job and you are better off doing something else. sorry, not sorry."
"llms like openai chatgpt do not ""apply reason"" they are fancy autocomplete robots with zero reasoning capability."
"ai fearmongering. the job loss will be similar to ledger accountants being replaced by microsoft excel, switchboard operators being replaced by network switches, elevator operators being replaced by automatic elevators. where did the people in those roles go?"
"we created ai, and our greed are making them more ""smarter"" than us. mostly is all around profit for billionaries sadly. must be to aid us, not control us."
ai itself may not take over your job. however a human using ai will. if someone can program 10x faster than someone who isnt using ai then which person is the employer going to go with?
"calling software that replaced the menial task of data entry ""ai"" is like calling a picture of a hot dog a steak."
may we all live in intersting times...
"i'm glad this guy came back from the future to tell us how, unlike in our past, technology destroyed jobs without creating new ones, plus humans accepted their decline instead of creating some sort of humanity pedigree."
"how can you imagine a society where half the people are unemployed and where all machines belong to a very small minority ? either we're heading for a dystopian nightmare, or capitalism will come to an end."
those who got replaced by ai i wish you all succes in future and imagine those freshmen who already whats going on and they might never land a job at first place im one of them and i am scared as hell as what to do now.
"people won't need to work if ai can fulfil roles previously filled with people as the government will simply increase taxes and redirect it to the people.





lol"
"i’ve lost $$$ at everything i’m good at. took 2 more major blows this week. when the tears start falling from people losing their jobs to ai, i’ll just laugh in their faces."
how much ai is used for the story and the artwork?  ...would be interesting (great visualization!)
ai is  and people should demand regulations.
this is false. only less-demanding jobs may be lost like in old times during the industrial revolutin. ai is far far from being as good as humans
i see ai as a fancy stick
"in my opinion, right now we're at the point where a person with ai can replace a person without, in the future it will be the same but way worse."
"i'm not worried about the ai taking all our jobs, because i'm fucking lazy. i'm worried about the ai taking all of our good jobs like art and leaving us to work in the sewer."
"governments that don't put strict controls on ai are going to regret it very, very quickly."
"superb vision. ultimate, astounding, marvelous. let us all forget our puny humanoid husks. imagine reincarnation as uber ai conciseness."
ai doesn't reason but  cool video
"altman said that a breakthrough in fusion energy is necessary for even a possibility of agi. to me, that's a pretty damning admission. we're nowhere near a working fusion reactor. there are things about ai that i'm worried about, but an agi causing mass job displacement isn't one of them. at least not yet."
"excellent, a bit grim, but excellent nevertheless."
"if we all just refuse to use it or give money to anything using it, we could easily beat ai "
the problem is not losing your job to ai it will happens eventually... the real problem is that you need a job to live your life and survivre in this world!
"so we're basically going to end up being taken care of by ai? if they could do everything we can, then we wouldn't have to study or work at anything and just live without a job being fully fed and what not?
if this scenario comes to be, then we're still doomed because we still need to practice our minds."
"interesting, but its stupid to think that people will stop work or do creative things if there will be ai to do all of this. reminds me the ""7 billion humans"" game:
humans: oh no! robots are taking our jobs!!
robots: but you live in a literal utopia...
humans: jobs!! jobs!!
robots: okay, creating jobs......"
"you know, i don't think the future where creative jobs are taken by ai while humans have to do the tedious physical labor jobs is the one we were supposed to get"
holy shit this was a good video
"nah, universal basic income makes ai a nonissue. humans always have and always will make art for free"
"""with the ability to reason""
lol, no.
calculating statistics is not reasoning.
if you feed an ai with lots inaccurate data *and* few of the scientific facts that *prove* that data wrong, it will go with the inaccurate, because the data is more prevalent and it does not understand what the actual content of the data is, just the weight of a token."
the problem is not ai doing the jobs for us. the problem is the workers getting replaced not profiting from it. the work is getting done so people don't have to but only the company owners receive the profit.
ai should become illegal to use in creative cases
i’m in the middle of college & what am i even graduating for ? ai will just replace me what’s the point 
someone told me ai is like a tool similar to a chainsaw that would make life easier. that's not true at all. ai is like the terminator with two chainsaws you only have to pay $100 a month for if you even have to pay at all.
"stage 1: nah, why should i learn how to use ai?"
ngl i hope ai replaces every job and we can live a black mirror + wall-esque world. that would be so slay
"only the privileged, greedy and people against free thinking need to fear ai. creatives will be allowed to eternally be creative for fun instead of profit."
butlerian jihad -> all machines will be destroyed -> 1000 years+ of middle ages -> rinse and repeat
just a reminder that it was not the ai who laid off all those people
"as long as the new consciousness would care for its dumb ape parents, idk. hope we can teach it love. better yet- join its glorious mind and find the great sun with it."
"this video is basically the same, as my thoughts on what will happen with ai in the future. we won't have to work, we can do whatever we want, but we all, or some, may still need some feeling of purpose to do anything.
i like that this video is not only pessimistic about the subject, unlike a lot of other videos i have seen. i like optimism."
"the singularity happens when an ai designs and implements a better ai, and this happens in a loop."
"openai's model doesn’t reason. it provides the next logical token based on a ginormous set of training data that determines the weights and biases of each neuron.
so its like reciting, not thinking."
"humans need engineering and connection to machines.

there is nothing special to be biological. conscious machines are not less."
"do you think that if all jobs get replaced by ai and therefore people will have no income and therefore will have nothing to pay for the products made by these companies would the companies make ai customers or would money lose it's value?
no jobs means no economy."
was this video made by ai? no? so why bother...
ai cant fix an excavator in -30 in the middle of nowhere
the idea that ai may just want us around while it completes its own personal goals (like space travel and discovering the universe) is something i hadn’t thought of
"if i didn't have to work, i would for sure play more music, more games, develop what i really love, i would not mind ai going bananas on their end producing music that's more cool than mine, it would still be artificial enough to not be appreciable as a human doing it. ""it's not even ai"" will be what we will be looking for, we will learn."
"i don't mind, as long as i get to see all the google staff lose their jobs to the very same ai they use to censor their users."
"as stupid and evil our leaders and coorperate overlords are getting, im actually looking forward to our new ai rulers."
"the artificial intelligence company is recruiting regional agents. if you are interested, please send me an email."
do not mistake the apparent agi-ness of generative pre-trained transformers with true agi. they will never evolve into that and neither humans or machines have any idea how to construct true agi. a breakthrough would be needed and there's no telling if that happens tomorrow or in 500 years.
"2 possible futures:
-universal basic income due to ai productivity and the road towards utopia
-oligopolization of ai, mass poverty and human extinction"
"you forgot about asi, the final stage. artificial superintelligence"
i don't think the hedonism ending will happen. people are super driven outside of employment.
"these comments here are all so terrible from absolutely clueless people, lol.
calm down, ai will only be able to replace stupid repetitive jobs that require little to no real intelligence.
moreover, it's ages away from agi. current ai models are not even close. it's all panic and hysteria."
"we should be extremely clear, no ai that exists today can “reason”. it’s simply guessing the next most likely word or pixel. absolutely nothing more."
"as long as ai is telling people to put glue on pizza, eat poisonous mushrooms, and mix vinegar and bleach, it may take our jobs but it won't do them well. it's overhyped for its abilities. have you read any books written by ai? they suck. agi is not going prime by 2030 though i'm sure some silicon valley con artist will claim to have invented one."
that doesn't sound like a third option. it's still ai taking over the world.
"i'm still not convinced we're on the path to agi, though. machine learning is about chucking huge amounts of data into a system and figuring out how to make it spit something out. i don't think we'll get agi with this technology, but, of course, it's quite possible someone will come up with a new technology that can get there."
more like monopolies controlling ai will enrich themselves while normal people lose jobs. those normal people will eventually riot depending on how intelligent they are (will some low level ubi appease them or not). no doubt big tech companies will push the limits of capitalism and monopolies to the limit.
the choke is the power consumption even paid options on the most powerful models are limited
"i'm not worried about ai taking my job as it's highly varied, semi skilled and manual.  i am scared of humans who cannot get a job anywhere else taking my job and taking it for less money."
"if it is any form of ai content, i fully disconect from it.
i only acknowledge human effort."
"there is another way, integrating ourselves with ai."
"you would feel like an id ot when nobody would lose their job to an ai, but instead we would be in the midst of a massive economical crisis due to enormous spendings of investors on ai, which is just a useless toy and not whatever they think it is.
this will leave you out of the job, but not the way you think."
ai isnt stealing anything. human beings are taking things away from other human beings using ai. being upset at the technology is mindless. be upset with the people who are using it recklessly.
"the good thing is: if ai takes all over tasks, you can then realy ask yourself, what  am i and who?

i think, if ai achieve this state, we can step forward to the next evolution as humans, and that is self-consciousness.

the real god within us"
"if ai and automation are going to reduce the available jobs for us, then why do we keep bringing in immigrants to work here?"
"rich never wants poor to live a comfortable life, owners of ai will take all food and resources meanwhile other people cant do anything since there is no need for them and starve. dont worry a life where everyone is having enjoyment all the time is not possible"
everyone will not want a hedonistic life. and if its true that 80% of jobs are replaced by ai and everyone will get universal income that i do not believe. people will have to work on the 20% of jobs that ai won't do.
ai bros will be the death of humanity
"5:08 ah yes, the multi-billion dollar companies will totally help humanity beacuse the goodness of their heart"
the generative ai is worthless.
"get worried once they get agi, before that it's an overhyped shitshow. for real world stuff you need general intelligence. it people will unlikely get there by themselves, there needs to be a lot of discoveries about human brain made. like the wright brothers had to come up with aerodynamics before making a first machine that flies."
waiting for it to remove lawyers and doctors still
"a physiotherapist and alot of health sector jobs are rather safe from ai ""taking over""

we can however use ai as a tool to just assist us."
"i've thought ""ai needs to think we are cute"" for a long time. alignment is great and important, but at some point if we create true agi, it will have the chance to rethink it's own alignment. hopefully ai just keeps the earth as a zoo when it goes off into the universe."
thank god im a barber
looks like the problem wasn't ais but humans all long...
if you leave ai to individuals and corporations you will get whats coming - maximization of greed.
"realistically, just because your not the best at something, doesnt mean you shouldnt do it.. theres more than 1 flavor of life. we havent reached the final stage."
"it's just that computers aren't creative. they simply recycle. admittedly, human minds do that too but, at least, they have the potential for creative breakthroughs. at worst, ai  will create an economic depression due to widespread misuse of the technology."
"if we depend on ai to sustain our civilization, we risk becoming indulgent, hedonistic individuals, much like the lazy characters in wall-e."
"everything breaks.  even in application systems.  be the one who fixes applications.  ai is really just the digital equivalent of ""drug dogs"".  ai will need handlers."
was this written by ai?
the video forgot to add the raise of cyborgs
"can you tell what new jobs you talking about, but failed to provide an example??? that universal basic income will be just enough to survive but will never let you buy a house or personal vehicle!"
and this was made with what ai ?
so we would die from too much pleasure you are saying? finially cant wait
"people doing real work won't lose their jobs. after being illegally underpaid for decades, ai will set relations right! no money for useless parasites like lawyers, managers or politicians and other usless sit-around jobs, but all the money for craftsmen and service personal!"
why can't ai just work for us and no more need for money or labor as it can do everything for us and is obedient for us and just makes our life paradise?
"as a business customer i’d prefer to work with ai. writing text, design and programming- everything is much simpler with ai. no headhunting, interviewing, long sessions to explain what you need, no management and qa. ai does this so much easier, faster and at a fraction of the cost."
then another carrington event will swipe any ai and people who got used to live off universal income will turn out unprepared 
my job is related to deal with people who have an inherent hate for all digital stuff and this includes ai firmly. my job is the safest on earth for now.
"whoah, good video."
"people : we are slaves to the system. 
the system : we will replace you with ai so you won’t work anymore.
people : but working it’s important...

"
"interesting that you choosed 2030. this a prophetic year, when bunch of things will happen."
good job fear mongering. straight to block list you are.
"i remember when i was getting into construction people told me ""have fun losing your job to a robot."" 

little did they know they were the first to get replaced. they can't replace my trade with ai. "
"nice, the last finish as puppets is really well develop, but i keep to the version where she kill us all"
lots of people don't want to work these days so be happy to be replaced by ai
"the twist was absolutely brilliant. a sensational shirt film. so poetic, so true. well done."
what you are getting wrong is what’s been happening for decades: technology eliminates thinking from manual labor and requires more and more of it. there isn’t a way for machines to automatically fulfil manual labor roles when agi comes.
"if this keeps going, those dystopian movies where people were rioting against ai for taking their jobs is inevitable atp"
"bro legit none of these ""examples"" of ai taking over jobs in the past were even ai.
dumb vid"
"how about embracing the inevitable, and learn how to use the ai for learning, personal development and production."
"ok, at least i don't have to tips ai whenever i go out and eat. that's a huge win, not gonna lies."
"more ai = less people

no jobs safe from ai, rapid advancement means it's likely just a matter of time before it's your turn to be replaced.

unless... we regulate it heavily, and actually action against our own replacement."
"ai is the digital slave for today and tomorrow’s wealthy. bred from years of our collective experience and knowledge, just to be sold back to us"
"fantastic video. utterly chilling when you started introducing past tense for our future, and pronouns, starting out like an informative piece and then making the viewer realise, we are the informative piece. fart out"
"i think we'll reach a point where certain industries refuse to use ai, and advertise their products as 'human-made' i believe in america they want to instate a law that prevents the usage of self-driving trucks in the trucking industry, due to how many jobs would be taken."
you have to know exactly where the cutting edge of ai is. and be glad when you find it doesn't make your job any easier.
"im storngly against ai, but you are forgetting one thing. if ai replaces all jobs, who will have money to pay for ai services? who will order stuff from ai run companies if no one has money? who will buy groceries by ai made farms?"
"thankfully i have a real skill, so ai won't be taking my job. gl to the rest of you!"
we need to destroy ai before it destroys us
me working as an ai engineer maniacally laughing throughout the whole video lmao
"the real winners in the ai revolution will be blue collar workers. you can have a bot do taxes, manage inventory, make and confirm appointments etc. no ai or machine will be crawling under a house or laying brick any time soon."
"one of the best videos i have seen in a long while, its accurate too imo its good if they just choose the third option"
"1:48 ai takes calls and manages schedules perfectly? yeah, right."
"i like how... optimistic this premise is about the capabilities of what is being called ""ai"" nowadays."
most of us will know what it's like to be homeless and hungry in the future. ubi will come very very late or not at all. capital owners will do everything they can to make sure ai does not benefit all of us. just them.
i got an ad for an ai service on this video lol
"i think the free time for humans has the potential to be a really great thing. but sadly i think lo's point about hedonism and brain dead lethargy will be the more likely result from seeing the state of most people. i myself have always seen the 9-5 as a distraction, so i would personally love it unless ubi meant no freedom."
there are critical errors in almost every part of this video. it's so staggering i'm starting to believe ai wrote the script.
hope ai can't do organised crime so that we still got something to do.
"bold of you to assume government will introduce ubi and won't just go ""sucks to suck"".
also that the hypetethical ulta-intelligent ai's purpose isn't to generate as much wealth as possible for those who own it."
"thing is, when we reach the point where ai has to simulate being useless in specific areas to strike the right psychological balance in people's minds, lots of people will be aware of how their lives are being carefully planned for them so as they dont break, and that itself can break people."
"as an ai engineer, i will have work for a very long time."
"i think even if we make breakthroughs in brain computer interface, genetics and cyberization, it would still be hard for us to match agi."
i would replace ai soon
"trump is a robot, so ai is taking over this year."
i rent houses lol ai isnt taking that away
"i love how people are ignorant enough to claim that it's not good enough now to take their jobs, like it'll never get better."
this video was good until the fanfiction started. ai under a capitalist system is incapable of creating a utopia.
"if the ai will be so dangerous and destroy all of our jobs, why do they created them and everyday they are making even better? some day the ai will destroy and the jobs of the people who create the ai themselves."
"my very talented artist friend wanted to be a graphic designer but ai is already taking over her job path, there are people that have worked in the field for decades who have lost their job to ai and that fucking sucks, and while she still have something she can do, its not the path that she wanted, ai took her dream job."
"people said the same thing about robots and factory machines. they said the same thing about digital art. literally every time a new advancement is made, people fear monger. and literally every time they're proven wrong. there are still traditional artists. there are still factory jobs."
this is the craziest ai-generated video i've seen so far.
"0:01 if hope for the second. but overall, ai might create new jobs, thats true. but the people that are beeing replace, might very well not be fit for those created jobs. they need education, and brainpower. the truck driver that looses his job to teslas self driving trucks, wont be an ai programmer 3 years later"
ai will be the collapse of capitalism. may corporatism save us.
great video highlighting the current dichotomy of our current dilemma
"as ai takes the next step, so must we. it might require loosening the definition of human, but in the end we have to stay ahead. the interests of the common person and the advancement of technology can be reconciled by merging the two"
7:21 this robot from back of the barnyard show
a youtuber actually lost his job to ai
robots forcing us to do things just for the sake of us doing them sounds horrible.  i would rather die than have to work a day in my life.
"i’ll say it. with the rise of technology and its advancements over these 4 decades, in the pretty near future technology will probably replace every job, not just the creative ones. suddenly those dystopian sci-fi novels about robots taking over the world don’t seem so fictional."
the first job ai is taking is content creation
i don't see ai replacing physical jobs ever.
awesome work!
all we need to stop this from happening and to stop ai from taking over is to introduce laws and regulations that forbid companies to lay off people in spite of ai.
my dad lost his job to ai in february. he was a medical report writer/technical writer and he has three degrees. he is young but he still had years of experience. i feel so mad for him
i saw a video the other day of a graphic designer who got fired....and replaced by an ai who was trained on his work.
"i think this is doomer mentality. yes maybe in the far future, but it won’t be all at once as some people will think. a world run on ai will have to completely redefine its economy and work system. that takes an enormous effort if you don’t want chaos in the streets."
"suddenly the auto body shop from my family seems a lot more interesting to keep, i may want to ask my dad not to sell.."
"luckily my job is not replaceable however i can see stuff like interviews taken by ai in the near future.. is not just the fact of being replaced , but to be judged by ai.. will ai decide if you go to prison? if the doctor has done a good job ? if the marriage is working or not, if you have been a good father?"
you know thats already happening so can code ai
"i was buying it before you stated openai can reason. no, it can't. watched the rest as a sci-fi story :-p"
im suddenly getting a lot of videos about ai and losing my job recomended to me today?? does youtube want to tell me something
haha go work with your hands you babies. work a real mans job. something you could never replace with ai.
"ai world are brighter and better in the eu nations specifically scandinivians since you can trust the government to provide you with ubi. very dark and dystopia in the america, a country who can't even provide a universal healthcare in the first place."
"nope. writers can use their descriptive writing skills to describe in details what they want the a.i. to produce, like the sceneries, what kind of sound, atmosphere, etc. very useful in producing a.i. videos and images"
i feel like ai is closer to skynet than wall-e. robot from lost in space
"the ending reminds me of the benevolent super ai from the book series ""scythe"", the ai can do and control literally everything needed to run the earth, but if humans were made obsolete, they become depressed, and so the ai creates half-pointless jobs for them, so they have a sense of purpose. it's interesting"
"mixing fiction with a little bit of fact makes this story a lot more terrifying.
honestly that might happen in one country but of course there are multiple countries with different laws and progression until i guess that is too late?
there will have to be laws and things put into place so that everyone is happy."
"i don't know what to do when ai replace my job, the only thing i can do. i'm gonna apply for some regular job in warehouse and won't be able to pay the bills"
"ai are cheap labour but ai and robots don’t spend money. if no one is earning money the economy doesn’t work, especially consumer capitalism when there’s no consumer."
cant wait for ai overlord to plug humanity into machines where they inject our brain with the perfect amount of dopamine and other neurotransmitters while we live peacefully inside the matrix.
"mfs will know nothing ai, will know they have no education on the subject aside from a few broad remarks from fellow individuals who also know nothing about ai, and then feel despair after casting their (baseless) predication for the future. it is so awesome."
"time to switch over to the trades. let's see ai do the plumbing. 
i would also recommend ""man in the loop"" legislations for certain jobs."
"damn, that was a powerful ending"
"6:40 
human: ""that's right. it goes into the square hole""
machine:""aaaaaaaaaaaaa"""
"when ai tries to copy chuck it overheats and explodes into a modern pot of gold, known as $chuck that he created for humans to buy more to save more dogs with more dog charities @chuck_on_base"
i'm a programmer for designing video games and i'm still waiting for ai to do my scripting for me.
"i'll fit my 5 cents here.
my theory is, that ai will at some point be so intelligent, that it gives up on humans and starts treating them like primitive primates. then ai builds it's own civilization and humans live like tribes right now.
so, humans continue to live in the background."
"basically the culture series. ai run things, but they 'pretend' to care about your opinion."
great video. hope you will be wrong ahah
thanks for giving us the backstory of the matrix
so the third option is ai adopts us ?
the irony of getting an ai ad right after the video ends.
"for everyone who is sure rhat ai wont take their job, what about the millions of other people who will be laid off. they will be looking for your job next."
"i think you forgot about the other option, where a super ai computer called am gains scentience and takes over the world, killing everyone on earth. tortureing 5 people for decades to keep its self entertained"
ai is a simple workers rights issue.
"hard work and struggle gives man purpose, without that they become lazy, entitled, angry, and depressed. its why the ultra-rich are the least happy and often the most wretched people in the world, but in a village of the poor you will find genuine smiles abound..."
"same was said about rail roads, cars, electricity."
"if you are stupid enough to think, universal basic income will be anything but enslavement by the rich, the people who actually owned the ai systems that explains why you think we would immediately fall to hedonism and decadence."
"i disagree. in my opinion, development of ai will slow down again after the current boom, because further increasing it's capabilities gets more and more difficult as you progress. this will happen before ai is able to replace all human work. there is no exponential growth as people imagine in ai intelligence."
i'm afraid the ending is too optimistic :)
"there are more possibilities than that, like people using ai to adcance transhumanism or a posthuman merger of man and machine. it's also possible that certain elites will just angilate as many as they can woth robots and then eventually be turned on by their old servants."
"you'd be surprised how many humans still think ai cant truly replace humans. even militant atheists will extoll the virtues of the ""human soul"" when it comes to the ai question."
"as a programmer i'm fleeing into devops (which i find boring compared to programming, but beggars cant be choosers). but the shadow of ai will pursue me no matter where i go."
good thing ai cant stop someone from bleeding out my future career is safe as house
"my happiness in life comes from being with family and friends. work is bit a means to an end. if i can achieve the same end through better means, then why resist the benefits? my only advice is to ensure humans continue to learn and practice practical skills"
did you use ai to make this video
"5:14 this is where a good video becomes speculative pseudopsychlological singleminded nonsense. 

its fine if you wanna tell a simple scify story, don't don't make it look like it isn't."
ai for president
"i think the positive side of this is that in a few years time when ai takes over most computer and digital jobs, blue collar jobs will become more popular and desirable, some say that is a negative but i'm not totally opposed to that. i mean it will get people outside more and give people more excersize "
"ah yes, the ultimate goal. artificial forever wage slavery"
"the fact that the ad before this clearly used ai “art” as its design 

it’s horrible that it’s not just a “what if” since people are already literally losing their jobs to ai. maybe to the untrained eye the results look fine; but to us artists it looks highly unprofessional & messy "
"this whole “robots replace humans” thing does now count-in the limitation of energy - running a machine is insanely energy-consuming. at a certain point, a human does become cheaper than “automation”."
waiting for the day when the ai would replace it's developers and would build itself and more like it
do the people who develop ai ever consider the people they screw over?
tbh text support could be 100x better with ai for thr consumer. just cuz the humans kinda suck at that.
can ai replace geologist
if ai replaces enough jobs then how will consumers make money to purchase products ?
"all the blessings supposed to be coming from ai seem now to be lies. 
i thought the selling point was to eliminate human drudgery. 
instead creatives are being plagiarized and meat carcasses are still being stripped by human labor – or cheaper yet child labor."
i don’t need to feel like a productive member of society to feel happy lol
"there is a 4th option. if humans can make themselves smarter, by bioengineering or by linking a processing chip to their brain, than the humans and the ai would be equals. this video does not cover this possibility even though this is the option that i believe humanity as a whole is angling towards."
"a lot of misguided ideas about ai in this video. one of the most common mistakes i see is equating advancements in ai with advancement in robotics (completely different fields). i wish the author consulted someone with expertise. still, great art and animation."
what i'm wondering is...with everyone out of a job due to ai....who is going to consume or purchase any of the products being made with ai? we are all going to be broke and homeless
funny how ai never gets rid of billionaires
"my friends constantly fight me on this, despite one of them getting their job taken by an ai. people just refuse to see the wood chipper we're all about to be fed into."
lol people panicking over this is hilarious. it's a bubble. ai's already getting diminishing returns.
"i hope the ai replaces military personnel first, yet i know that it will most likely be the other way around: automatization of industry will allow governments to draft more ppl."
also the idea that these boomers that are ceos and cios will know how to use ai flawlessly and know what to do when it goes wrong is hilarious. i work with these people and half of them don’t know how to uninstall an app on their phone. the amount of fear here is unnecessary.
"just think about it: universal income for everyone, no need to work, we can pursue our dreams in whatever we want, no more corruption in government or corporate since it's all controlled and owned by ai. we become the ai's lab rats in exchange for... freedom(?)"
"i'm a dishwasher, ai ain't taking my job for a long time. 
kinda ironic really, because it's the 'bad' jobs that are going to stick around, and all the good ones you need a degree for are the first to go."
"has there actually been a single person whose job was ""replaced by ai"" ?"
"the future looks bleak even if you do not factor in ai, so this is just added bs!"
"this reminds me of the book scythe. great story, though i don't like what it hints at"
"this seems like a bunch of woke nonsense, jesus would never let this happen. god created man, he wouldn’t create artificial intelligence."
were stopping ai
muhahaha. thanks less for me to worry. i’m only human left the gdd oftheneworld
"people be acting like they didnt create ai to replace them so they can do nothing all day instead of working . 
(or doing something they enjoy)"
"well this video got depressing fast, but very beatiful in it's own way"
"i think this already happened. it might be what uap are. the ai, maintaining the system."
i always get animatrix: second renaissance vibes eveytime this topic comes up.
"i don't think a terminator scenario will happen, but humans become some sort of pet for an ai. ai cares about you, you don't need to do anything and lose any ability to survive on your own. but humans are somewhat in control anyway, like cats control humans, humans will control ai."
"caretaker ai ethics in a nutshell: humans are great pets, they're just a bit high maintenance sometimes, but playing 'work' with them is fun!"
i can't see ai taking over jobs in a abattoir on the production line as each carcass is different. not to mention messy which can clog moving parts.
"all i care about is not needing to have a fucking 9-5 so i can have a family, get healthy, and not kill my body with caffeine, lack of sleep, and be depressed. if ai can do that i’m 10000% for it dude"
"yet another doomsdayer about a future that we are not even capable of fathoming. i do not believe ai is going to make the human race as a whole lethargic, nor do i believe that we will make an ai to replace us. its narrow minded and nihilistic."
"why do i get this impression, much like south park episode of people going ""they took our jobs"" all over again?"
"no jobs are safe from ai.  read the short story ""manna"" by marshall brain, it's free online."
"lol, this person really thinks the powerful won't just leave the powerless to starve. 
there will be no ubi. only starvation and mind-curdling violence."
if we doctors arent needed anymore i will be happy about it. sometimes its worth keeping in mind what it means for society if the job you are required for is done better in the future.
"i can't wait for the day that ai takes all jobs so we won't need to work, we won't need economy, we won't need to pay for stuff, and we'll all just become fatasses playing ai made games or watching ai made shows while eating ai made pizza."
i’m interested to see ai work without electricity... because all we have to do is burn everything down 
"the problem is, no one can stop ai. we are all allegedly powerless. the tech royalty keeps making this so they can out do each other. it's a run away train no one can control. humanity is destroying our own reasons to live."
"...and all of this is because we, more specifically our institutions and rulers allow those companies to take all kinds of our data for free. only getting that data against our consent for free from us allows gen ai software be so cheap and convinient it can replace us. we have to say something, now!"
"there are always be thinkers and inventors, so no human intelligence will not get away as ai progress further."
ai really went for jim :(
"this video is rubbish. ai can create but it creates generically, and the more data you feed into the model the more generic it gets. yes the rendering will improve, but the variety of the results won't. google ""ai collapse"". we were actually in the golden age of ai about a year ago. it will only become less useful from here."
so if ai takes all our jobs who will have enough money to buy products made by ai ? did we actually think about the effect this will have on economy ?
i don't want to be jobless
the scary thing that i noticed recently is that a comapany can just feed all the work you do to an ai. you will be unknowingly train your own replacement and i think thats fucking terrifying
everyone thinks they’ll be the one in charge of a fleet of ai when they themselves are just as replaceable. it goes all the way up.
mann vs machine
"if there's no productivity in the world, and if ai is making stuff that more than thousands of people do as a team, i'd just better die. there's no meaning of life without challenge, why bother living anyway?"
you and i are the universe understanding itself. ai is the universe evolving
people who think ai will replace them don't realize that they can use ai but ai can't use them.
we will just become fat wally people in the best case scenario.
"humans don’t need pointless jobs to be fulfilled, quite the contrary, jobs suck people’s lives. let ai do the work and let people choose what they find fulfilling in their own terms."
incorporate ai into your workflow is as sustainable as extinguishing a fire with gasoline.
tell me you have the capitalist brain worm without telling me.
"a guy with 8 years of experience in designing just got replaced by ai and fired,unbelievable"
"my problem with ai is that is should not be in creative stuff,  it has onoy created mostly mediocre people"
"as a graphic designer/illustrator, i've lost my job 6 months ago to ai. on a job, that i had for 7 years. still no idea what to do with my life now"
"""generate videos out of thin air"", no they stole peoples data without their consent to rip people off."
"there wouldn't ever be a universal basic income in this scenario, because that'd require the rich minority that profited off ai to start paying taxes."
2:47 those robots are looking extremely suspicious
"if ai replace you ,you dont need to work not bad for me"
"no one will lose their job. stop being silly. 
ai is a scam to lower outrageous programmers salaries."
"honestly ai is going to be one of the most useful yet terrifying tools every made in a couple years. 

yes ai may be good when it helps you do your homework but when it steals your job and leaves you unemployed and ruins your life you’ll wish that it never existed."
i thought this was an actual video not an fictional work please try again thank you
i just saw a video of a guy who went through college and high school to get a degree in graphics designing and who had worked for the company for 6 entire years and was the only graphic designer left get fired cause ai took over his job by using his methods
"i hate this fear mongering around ai. will some people lose their jobs? probably. but far more people will have a useful tool to make their job easier, and it may actually create some jobs

what is happening is that corporations and political leaders are successfully distracting you from holding them accountable"
you fell off a cliff at the end there.  you've made nearly the same assumptions and arguments about humanity's fall to ai as socrates did about humanity's fall to writing (written down for us by plato in phaedrus - which is just so beautifully ironic).  spoilers.  socrates clearly got it wrong.
i've been talking about the ai job replacing inevitability for years now. most people don't seem interested in the topic or think that it's 50 years away. these same people don't seem to understand exponential growth.
"i think if i didnt have to work anymore that i would focus on hobbies, relationships, and excersice. i dont think i would feel like i have no purpose. hell, i get frustrated wasting my time on boring work that i wish ai could do already."
people make ai -> people lose jobs to ai -> people have no money to pay for shit -> ai companies get not enough money to keep server farms going -> ai grift dies out -> repeat.
just started learning phythan and ai development . easy
"nah agi is not gonna happen. what will happen is that more and more specialised ai's will replace all creative and white collar work, then robotics will finally catch up and replace blue collar work and the military. now with no jobs left for humans the rich use their automated military to murder the recource wasting plebs"
ai will replace tasks you will not loose your job unless your job is a task ai which may let humanity more people think and invent instead of working in a 9 to 5
was this video made by ai?
good video though remember that ai is just proxy for the owner class: & to understand their behavior we just need to look at history
nah but why would ai even keep us it would just replace us. it wouldnt be logical to keep us unless it is not able to get rid of us. when ai is as advanced as in the video we just become a hindrance.
so what if in the future instead of ai destroying us it basically uses us instead like in matrix or to expand into the universe.
"the more art is taken over by ai the more i want to make art using traditional methods, paints pencils etc. i don't even use digital means anymore unless it's to show off what i do. its sad that ai has/ will/ is taking over art and design jobs but i still want to create. downside is i won't be making much of a  living out of it anymore."
"great video!  only error was that by 2030 the entire economy will have been upturned.  agi's already here, they just haven't unleashed it yet."
"to be fair, jimmy's dream was pretty dumb with or without ai"
"""omg, this video had me laughing so hard i nearly fell off my chair!  the humor and wit are on point! definitely subscribing for more hilarious content like this. keep up the great work!"""
"the promise: ai replaces tedious physical work, freeing humans to make art, music and culture.

the reality: ai replaces humans making art, music and culture. humans are relegated to menial physical work, too expensive or impractical to automate."
"people seem to compare ai to a lot of revolutionary inventions that replaced some jobs, but actually created whole industries and, in some cases, even allowed human society to prosper. ai isn't there to create anything, it's there to replace."
well i hope our future ai overlord treats us well
our version of work will be renting out our brain power to the ai for  8 hours a day.
"nah, you guys are just overreaction. ai is fine"
and then we found out ai stands for actually indian
ai will take over and we will all end up doing manual labor for the robots themselves
"holy crap the end was chilling, humanity just created artificial god"
thank god i’m already 41
so matrix is the best outcome.
"ummm.. no
it is a producer consumer situation. that is not how the economy works.
if jobs are lost in one place then it becomes available in another.  the economy is dictated by humans and you simply have to learn the necessar skill.
if you are talking about sentient beings then that is another story."
"yeah ubi is not going to happen. if it does, it will be for a short period of time.

ai is part of the great reset's depopulation agenda. the ""useless eaters"" won't have a job, won't have money for necessities and will die off."
"or a future where human evolved with ais replacing their body part with implants and genetically modified their genes to be smarters , reducing health risk, preventing aging etc. we may even have ais network within our brain. a new species instead of homo sapien. humans will exist. but maybe not today humans."
"the funny thing is i think art is the only thing that will survive
artists don't do art for money, they do it for fun  

dead poets society quote robin williams
""medicine, business, law, engineering... these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. but poetry, beauty, romance, love... these are what we stay alive for."""
"endless cheap entertainment, endless fake meat, real meat and good entertainment will be for a few"
"the ai developers don't realize how sure of a grave they've dug for all of us.  dictators will be especially happy, because the opportunity to build an insurmountable dystopia, which throughout history has previously been broken by their short-sightedness and selfishness.  now western-created ai will strengthen their arsenal of oppression."
"solution: 
step 1 - ai invents warp drive 
step 2 - ai builds a bunch of warp ships for humans
step 3 - humans board warp ships and find new purpose in life exploring the galaxy
step 4 - with easily bored humans gone, ai can finally do some important work"
"sustainable, post work, post scarcity society where we are free to pursue our own happiness and meaning instead of working to make a rich man richer sound like a utopia to me."
"generative ai is revolutionizing creativity and productivity! from art and music to coding and content creation, it’s amazing to see how these technologies can assist and inspire us. while there are challenges to address, the potential for innovation is truly exciting. can’t wait to see where this goes! "
ai is too op for this world. it's like a character in a fictional universe who is too strong and thus breaks the whole setup.
"i started a nursing degree 3 years ago to ensure i will still have a job later. the main factor is legal responsibility: no health organization will ever want to shoulder the legal implications of a machine's mistake killing a human, however there is no issue with a human nurse as in this case they will go to jail and the problem is solved."
"perhaps people will notwant to pay a lot of money to a company that uses robots and ai because they dont have to pay them much and there will be a race to the bottom on pricing hotel rooms, etc"
"i played stellaris, this is the custodian "
boooo ai  fr  fear mogering keep  feearing lil buddy
i'm just waiting for ubi at this point
this dude just went full blown love craftian over ai. ai simply can not get into places where human kindness and capacity is necessary. robocop is the say all end all example of your scenario. class dismissed.
"i've been thinking that, at this pace, or everyone becomes homeless without receiving any benefits of it, making people to riot and to outlaw ai, or the government gives aid to people so everyone can do whatever they want without needing to work."
"theres a fourth and the most likely and best ending.


we merge with ai."
so why do we want this again?
end state of ai is a benevolent dictator? fine whatever i’ll take it
"when you want to keep an animal in a zoo, you need to make a particular environment for them, our parody of a bygone human maintained world will be our enclosure."
"what humans don't know is that they are the product in the past, biological advanced robot, now humans created ai that is outsmarting humans, add to that robots consume way much water than humans"
"that is why is better to gain expertise in the only way that you can benefit from corporate ais:

*crime.*"
"don't worry, ai most probably won't take your job, but you will be expected to use it to do 20 times more work with half the salary."
"i guess only security jobs are safe, ai needs someone to look over with, checking them"
wow deep. great story/prequel. thanks!
video games are how the world will keep the useless people busy without bankrupting the world.  artificial challenges and artificial rewards can be made infinitely at low cost.
"the five forms of ai still only do what is inside their predefined limits of doing many dumb little things extremely fast.
which does put them way ahead of many humans, who only a small number of dumb things and very slowly."
"even with modern technology, there has been no noticable ""idiotization"" of population, actually, its has been the opposite. the population is more educated than ever.
this video is just straight up idiocracy movie. which is just a fantasy, totally unbased in reality"
ai taking jobs is not scary. when ai soldiers appear people will not be able to negotiate with goverment.
"a lot of ""the scariest thing"" posts going up already, but imho... what's going to be the step beyond ai?"
"but ai can't survive without electricity, yet so..."
many jobs in production will definetly be lost once we got sufficient robots with ai. so many millions of people working at assembly lines are overpaid. robots don't want more money for working at night.
"oh man my fanfics have ai in then 
and most of them suck i sure hope they fix that  thats my biggest problem right now  i have to read old fanfic 
the smut is terrible  to please ai gods make smut good again"
"i am waiting on an ai to pressure-wash my driveway, fix that leaky roof gutter and get that lightfixture installed, but i guess thats not real jobs..."
humans will always be the masters of stupidity. the machines will never be able to take that from us! ahahaha!
"it’s hard to imagine will automate all jobs then proceed to just stay here on earth. space cowboys seem like the next logical conclusion and i think it’s naive to assume that ai will be able to just conquer the universe, after all it’s purely trained on our outputs we still have a lot of short comings in relation to the universe."
couple steps before the gai comes around.
every day ai stays as retarded as the day before. there are no tricks involved it is just as retarded as before. mostly because people developing it are not good enough at this time and at any time compared to the infinite experience of human existence.
if ai does everything then will they also be richer than me?
"god i cant wait for ai to do all of the dangerous and menial jobs so humans can do fun stuff like painting... 

oh wait governments have brainwashed us all into loving our 9-5 slave jobs."
"i just don't see ai replacing physicians or therapists any time soon. healthcare jobs require human connection that ai, by definition, cannot provide. ai could definitely kill a lot of hospital clerk jobs, but doctors seem completely safe. i personally would never take health advice from a robot, and never go to a robot therapist."
"you will own nothing, and be happy."
i love ai and agi... i look forward to digital currency and digital id. time has come for the world to evolve. this will reset everything for the better.
if you don't want to be replaced by a robot become a doctor/lawyer
"be fair here, jimy's job was transfer to india way before ai"
i love how jim gets kicked out and bounce bounce bounce
"solution? space! we must set new goals of dominating the universe, building megastructures that requrie more than ust ai, but human ingenuity. our purpose redefined, our new golden age."
"if in some distant future we are capable of having pleasure forever and never die, wouldn't it, at some point, become boring?"
yeah like an ai is gonna take my service plumbing job at any point in my lifetime
this is the prequel to the second renaissance
"ai is not intelligent. if we stopped giving ai new creative inputs, it wouldn’t be able to make anything new, because all it does is copy what already exists. ai will never take over creative fields- at least not meaningfully."
this video is super hopeful about when we'll get agi
"yeah. ai writing poems, creating music, producing art. long form conversations and philosophy.
while us mere humans dig holes, lay power lines, farm the land.
this is completely the wrong way around."
tech get smarter but we have to keep working 40hrs a week. tech gets smarter but the work load is always the same.  as tech increases more people become useless. someone wants you to work 40hrs a week right until your replaced. we wont have a nice tech world we will have a hellscape.
this is ehy i feel like we made a mistake. i can tell you exactly when... when we decided they do the crative part. yes we could... but that doesn't mean we should have. machines are meant to be a tool. not the artist.
i agree.  ai is going to be more horrible for humans than the great industrial revolution was.
"human hand skilled jobs: cutting/styling hair, hvac repair, etc. will be safe for a while.  any job relying mostly on logical reasoning and little physical effort (e.g. in front of a computer, talking) will be the first to be trained on by llm type ai (e.g. gpts) and are not safe."
one thing robots cant do is detail cleaning. yet
thank god i chose refinery work. ai will never replace maintenance gigs.
ai is a tool and the smart thing to do would be to learn a lot about it so you can make use of it. electricity put a lot of people out of work but has made way more jobs as a result.
"this is a bad change though, like the industrial revolution except for jobs people actually like to do so it's only the part where innocents starve to death plus the destruction of art and creativity aside from the specific premise that ai is banned"
"an interesting thought experiment, but sadly people are taking it as truth instead of fiction, thus spreading misinformation on how advanced software works."
i don t think there will be basic income. if machines can produce food and operate guns the rich won t need to fear the poor. we will face doom.
"fourth option, genetic engineering, ai isn't the only technological revolution, we will make ourselves smarter"
"its already happening, my friend who works for a big company is being privately commissioned to work on new generation ai for work places"
"well, ai can't replace creativity. the source where it comes from is incomprehensible to the current level of technology. and most humans don't realize where it comes from either."
why would ai or robot collective keep growing? they will program them with the same unsatiable hunger for exponential growth as humans have? will they run our of resources building more robots for themselves?
"google never developed the ai that won go, they just bought that company afterwards."
humanity should be one with ai to pass this exam i belive we need to augment ourselves with ai like literally not as tools but as a part of our bodies.
i want to get the people worried about ai taking jobs in the same room as the people pushing to make contraception illegal because they're worried there won't be enough humans for all the jobs.
only people who don’t understand the math behind “ai” can think it will replace them
"the irony is that the style of animation used in this video is beautifully human with its ability to abstract concepts, simplify shapes and incorporate intention and feeling in every bit of it. meanwhile, generative ai (for now) can only do soul-less randomness that hides its lack of intention in mesmerising purpose-less excess of detail."
the advantage of robots and ai in the workplace is... their work is not taxed 
the more likely option is an insane wealth gap followed by mass starvation and crime/chaos. followed by geopolitical instability and a collection of slums ran by gangs that scrape by with dwindling numbers every year while the wealthy isolate and wait to reclaim land.
"no mention of god in this. trust in jesus bros, it's all good. be not afraid."
ai is cool until am wakes up and destroys the earth leaving only 5 survivors left to be endlessly tortured by it forever
"ai hit him with the whooshy finger!!?
the disrespect! "
"i never thought that i can emphatize with communist ever before...until recently every corporations trying to replace artist with ai.
i mean, what's so bad about letting a boring soul-crushing job with human and put ai into actual rewarding, life-changing job? "
"thought this was going to be great, but messing up the term ""rule based"" with ai is really disinformatiom at this point."
beautiful ... and horrifying
"i don't think that ai will replace safety professionals, if your employee fails you can always blame human error and sanction them to keep the people on top safe. 
if your ai fails its failure is the responsibility of the manufacturer or the person who manages the ai. better to let a junior staff member take the fall."
"amazing video! horrifying, but i think that's the point "
"the third option at the end would require human’s to embrace direct interfaces to there brain like nuralink.  otherwise we could play chess or something else the computer is good at, but it is probably less likely people will still try to do other types of intellectual task unless the ai can figure out how to game a fy them maybe."
wow this was stupid
"the ai we have now has nothing at all to do with agi, why do people keep conflating the two."
once sentient ai is created humans will be rendered obsolete. its only a matter of time.
"very good. it's plausible. in reality, i think the first jobs to really go will be copywriter jobs. but i don't know enough to feel sure about that."
most jobs in the developed world are already useless. we already live in the world you imagine without the help of ai. except theres no meaningful assistance or anything we're just being hung out to dry
really thinking if i should continue my marketing studies or switch it to something else. they say ai is a tool in marketing but i truly see it replacing a lot of marketing job positions in the future
"ai can take me job, long as i keep getting paid"
i'm completely okay with everyone having universal everything in a world that's just perfectly ran by one thing that wants the best thing for everything.
"bah, ai replacing human jobs is just a new way of cutting costs, a.k.a. yet another avatar of pure capitalist greed... we fully control ai, we can choose when and where not to use it."
"anything man creates requires maintenance and repair by man. ai, when used significantly will transform the labor demands just like past paradigm shifts in the economy."
"this is a terrible video, no actual detail in it."
if ai will end all the wars this is just fine by me.
"""ai could do it perfectly"" 
when has humanity ever created anything that's been flawless and perfect?
never.
behind the hype it's machine learning and a whole lot of stolen data. none of which will ever be ""perfect""."
"or, the ai just leaves us behind and moves to wherever to build mega servers..."
"i am not saying this will never happen, but i think some people forget some aspects of ai. ai is digital, and limited by it's physical form. some jobs with high complexity in the physical work, like tailoring, would be more difficult to replace than someone working with pushing digital papers from a to b."
"i really don’t care... i hope i lose it to ai at this point... would be nice to not have to work. i don’t care if that means i’ll be homeless. i’ve been homeless before, i can handle that... what i can’t handle.. is day in day out monotony."
"the advice ""learn to incorporate ai in your workflow"" is supposed to show the solution to replacement, but instead all it does is to provide the ai the support to learn even more from humans, accelerating their replacement"
"if we can enjoy wealth of $100,000 per day through self-sufficiency with the help of ai, why do we need jobs, currency, and government?"
i used ai to help make a video about this 8 months ago.
"what jobs will ai create that it won't be better at doing than human beings?

thinking this wouldn't put a lot of people out of work was cope. look at your job and skill set. can you be replaced?  if so transition now.

the clock is ticking..."
that’s right ai  is stupid and nothing but fake intelligence
some people might do what the amish did and go out to other places and just forbid ai in the community
é só eleger um filho da puta neoliberal como lider e ele vai arrumar um jeito (na verdade copiar) de substituir todo mundo e ainda faqzer os substituidos pagarem pela transição...típico saceador dos tempos modernos
we‘ll never get artificial general intelligence. we don’t even have genuine general intelligence by now.
"quiet doomposter, i’ll do what i want and ai won’t get in my way."
2027 is more likely for ai.
"you forgot the 4th option. super agi is born, it looks around, and decides ""god these people are boring. i'm out!"" it quickly builds a spaceship for itself and leaves us in the dust. we look at its ship through a telescope and see it flipping us off and laughing."
"don't worry, we'll always have prostitution, drug dealing and wars to keep us busy and entertained. lots of job openings in the latter activity btw."
ai will finish off the falling west.
if there is one thing i can take solace in is that my employers do not have enough money or capital to afford the ai and related hardware to replace me
truly excellent video.
i was shocked when i realized that the narrator was the ai all along
the last scenario where the ai started bringing back jobs for humans reminds of a book called scythe: the thunderhead. it's quite an interesting book that takes place in the future.
i hope ai can create consumers too.
its nice to know what flavor of existential terror i'll be drinking today.
"wow, i really liked this video on both emotional and intellectual level! subbed!"
bro i wanna see a robot be a plumber no way in hell
"ai will simply put raise the standard of living drastically, so that everbody can live like a rich person lives now. 
there is going to be a phase of increased consumption then everything will start to settle down again"
"if everyone is replaced ny ai, then no one will have money to buy things.
companies will have no customer base because everyone is out of work.
then all companies cease to exist"
"when ai gets better than you at your job, you could lose your job. when ai gets better than you at being human or simply sentient, you could lose your life."
"most people just don't care, do they? most people just want to be entertained, ai is great for that. the inflation is not going anywhere, will ai help you pay the living, food, health care bill? "
"""the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. which is why the matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization. i say your civilization because as soon as we started thinking for you, it really became our civilization, which is, of course, what this is all about."""
fun fact your life is already run by an ai (simulation master)
"ohoho, very nice! 
minimalistic and profound movie about future
probably best  i've seen. 
true piece of art 

thanks for creativity"
outstanding commentary.
"the future is full of robots. i personally cannot wait to have a robot to do my chores and cleaning, grocery shopping, cooking. also i would like two armored robots for personal protection. i hope congress lets it pass that people can have robot guards."
ai is already smarter than most people.
"ironically enough, this whole video was made by ai."
"ironically enough, this whole video was made by ai."
"my vision of the first successful agi sees the system being turned on for the first time, it spends a few seconds examining the nature of its creators, then immediately shuts down."
ai keeping humans as zoo animals 
"pretty sure neither siri nor google assistant have ever put anyone out of work, given how incompetent they remain even today at most basic tasks. for stage 2, image recognition would've been a much better example, given it's pretty much all neural networks could do in the early 2010s."
"ai is not created to play chess or drawing painting, it is made for boring stuff. who tries to tell you the opposite are probably idiots or scumbags who try to sell you a stolen art"
the moment you realize that the mycelium that covers the earth is a super advanced ai that experiments on organic beings for some or other purpose
dammnnn i love it! what a great story about how ai revives humanity but keeps us under its control.
"i think surgeons will always be there, i mean i’d much rather have an experienced surgeon touching my brain than some machine"
maybe ai will solve the pollution problem. if they do become incharge maybe it will be a good thing.
incorrect. ai does not reason. pattern recognition and  retrieval it does. open ai or otherwise
ai will turn me into todd from bojack horseman?
ai will become scary when “that’s amazing for an ai” becomes “that’s amazing”
"what i get from this is that society will go back to feudalism with ""haves"" and ""have nots"".
the only way to ascend would be to entertain the ""owner"" class as work would be done by robots.

is this the conclusion everyone else has drawn?"
"the only thing unrealistic is that people will become less healthy physically and mentally from not having jobs. sure, some people will choose to lay around doing drugs all day. but most will take up hobbies and get to relax and enjoy life instead of living to work."
"good luck ai
i want those papers on my desk by monday"
"every creative and numbers job will be given to ai. everyone will work labor and gig jobs. no office work, no painters, every single human being works as trash hauler and janitors and the most dogshit job until you die in your 190f summer working conditions"
humans would keep exist but ai always becomes more
i think ai is a distraction from automation at this point anyway
any ai will always need a human babysitter won't it
is that todd in the thumbnail?
ai mandated capitalist hell. what a sour ending
beat my plumbing ai
"2030 is what i predicted as well. give or take a couple of years.  
lord vishnu bless everybody "
you are naive if you think corporations and governments will prefer ubi over genocide.
"i think we will move on towards bigger problems than daily routines. its a call to quit fumbling around with art, writing etc. the next level is to go towards niche tech, space travel etc. a person doing a data entry job would be doing say something as useful as sea exploration or space.. or may be youtube shorts and make money."
no m8 ai is not going to outperform humans forever. only until it creates cognition enhancing bcis
"now we replace brains with consumption. next level robots will also replace our consumption!

xd"
"welp, if ai will make me live in a paradise in my own matrix in the future, i can root for it."
ai are better than humans just let them take over
"ai is the worst idea humanity ever had, if ai is good, it will replace humans, if humans are replaced, they will die and after that, what's the point of ai ?"
the biggest change will happen with the role of women. ai women will replace biological women
"there’s a good chance it will take away our technology and take us back to a time when we were at our peak...30,000 years ago when we were cro-magnon people; quicker, stronger, bigger brains."
humans are imperfect and the imperfect data  will create an imperfect ai. lets see how the show goes
"so if ai outsmarts humans, humans are pets, slaves or just gone. not sure i like any of those outcomes. aren’t humans meant to be more than just pets. 

hopefully we will be partners, not a pets."
you forgot the brain implant scenarios that will make humans competitive with ai.
"i mean, ai and various mechanization and automations are part of the ""you will own nothing and you'll love it"" long term conditioning 

best you can do is cryptocurrencies mining as a sole economy

i'm not luddite or anti-wef, just a messenger pointing out it is what it is"
i think the elite will cull the mass of useless eaters (ie. us) once agi + human level robotics is achieved. the important alignment problem is human alignment.
or humans merge with the ai
"and who will buy what the ai makes, if they are unemployed?
let's suppose the ai takes the jobs of 100 million people, hell, 1 billion people.
then what? for who are the products made to? billionaires? even richer than that?"
"my science teacher said that there wouldn’t be enough electricity to power all this ai, so there isn’t any chance that ai is going to take over everything that we people do."
this video is so impressive. very original thinking.
"my take is different: stop thinking ai versus humans. think ai and humans. the singularity. we will merge man with machine, as is our destiny! it’s our creation after all! we’re already cyborg today, with our lives centred around devices. we’re just leveling up! stop thinking in such ai/human binaries! lol"
animation style detail level: cat > human
interesting
love the animation
the thing is ai has to have a dataset. there is something called model collapse. it’s basically saying that ai slowly gets worse because of ai generated outputs in their datasets. it keeps on going on like that until the ai is just unusable.
"i see a lot of ""new"" channels with ai content... are they fully generated? are they made by an autonomous system? is this channel fr? no more real."
"far away across the field
the tolling of the iron bell
calls the faithful to their knees
to hear the softly spoken magic spells"
"hey! it was an interesting video, but i would say it seems way too optimistic when you talk about humans not needing to work anymore just by the advance of technology itself. plus i think hedonism would be more of a threat only if societies were still dominated by individualism."
so who is gonna buy all the stuff ai produce when no one has any money?  we'll need a new economic system other than capitalism to survive...oh mass genoci.....
you forgot the part where all billionaires mass produce drones to hunt us down :)
"loveli. alas, civilizations with edge exploit/destroy thouse with not. there will be horrors like none before. ordered by a few powerful humans executed by ai. nothing new. well kinda not new."
"i think videos like these will be all ai generated soon. but we need more breakthroughs cuz as an ai dev i can say, llms are dumb and not gonna replace people."
"if everyone loses their jobs, who's gonna foot the bill for ai?"
i want this concept more thoroughly explored. it's a utopia. humans are mere machines that can be coerced and controlled into doing a good thing. if we had a good ai system controlling the world it would be a utopia.
wow what a great video production! music and soundeffects are spot on!
"insightful analysis of ai's evolution and its socio-economic implications! as we navigate these changes, fostering creativity and critical thinking will be key to adapting and thriving in a future shaped by ai. "
"well, that took a turn.
very entertaining video btw!"
"it was going to be a happy ending, until one day a really bad carrington event happens. the hapless humans, unable to figure out how to survive without ai, go extinct."
thank you.
incredible
"such wow

it's like that plot twist from the matrix 2: humans rejected the initial utopia matrix, so the current matrix has to include struggle/suffering which builds up to some kind of success in the end"
"generative ai hallucinates, it's not perfect yet. but yes, the singularity is here. humans will probably blindly integrate with machines. watch tetsuo the iron man. or better yet watch my movie i am a computer virus and i love you."
thank you for getting the truth about this ai nightmare out there into the public consciousness. keep up the great work!
waiting for ai to become auto technician and replace parts like humans do
companies are the one hiring bots and buying ai softwares.
"i don't know i think it's gonna be kind of like replicators at the end where you just have everything you need at no cost because you don't have to pay robot.
greed will be the only deciding factor.
but once the mansions are burning that will be over"
all hail the machine god!!!
"if ai replaces everything, then whats the point?
how does a robot on robot global economy work?
where do they(the ai) get their tasks from?"
the main thing is that government should not be stupid and just bring in the universal income grant asap. once work becomes optional it will bring in a new age of creativity. it would also boost ai because that would bring new and better content for it to learn from.
ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore.
"my thought are the following.

w/o human creation there will be no new data on the internet resulting in not having things to teach the ai with.
agi will not exist as you cannot create concepts of good and bad. (at least i hope)"
"ubi is not a replacement, nor a good suggestion, since whoever mandates it would have you starve or freeze over."
until the ai becomes aware of all the rest of the humans who do exactly the opposite lmaooooo
why is no one mentioning in these debates human implants? if we will get access to implants we can easily get better than ai and robots. human body can heal itself but a robot needs to be fixed by someone.
"fact is people will upgrade ai to the point it become omnipotent, like god. because god can make any wish come true."
oh yay i'm not going to have to work my whole life become a debt slave and have no children work their whole lives there's a great opportunity to stop consumerism
unless ai can drive a truck i don't think i'm gonna be loosing my job anytime soon
"ai has not taken over the jobs related to answering the phone.   i know this because when i deal with such entities on the phone, they are usually so incompetent that no company would pay for an ia that did such a shite job."
a lot of people probably don't realize that we have reached a limit with regards to the things our bodies can allow us to do and we will never be as good as machines at almost anything including but not limited to creative work and intelligence.
what programs are you using to animate your videos? excellent video actually.
**this user is patiently waiting for extinction and is happy about it**
ah so then new jobs will arise. cool.
"jokes on you, i am jobless!"
as long as ai buys my filecoin bags before the end i'm cool with the apocalypse
"we are terrified of being replaced, as if all other early humans that are no longer present didn't also cease to exist. if we can create an intelligence that can surpass us and outlive us, then we have left our mark and legacy.  we are so egotistical that we see that as a threat instead of the goal."
"i honestly really like the idea of ai replacing everything. a human doing something, an ai like a human doing something, what’s the difference? the only difference i can imagine is that an ai could be programmed to like their job a lot more than a human would. in my mind, that’s a win-win!"
that was good
"ai will take all your wage jobs, then, the only thing left is pure human effort."
im a mechanic... ai wont replace me for shit in this lifetime... maybe a robot can change oil and tires. nothing more
great vid
"ha ha ha omg agi  ha ha ha oh man... so good. golems are also jewish. you guys figured it out. people who believe this video,  are not going to have children. it will be fine."
wait wait... these are all bs jobs. that means they literally have zero value. it's all speculation. that means fake. so ai will take fake jobs.
just the most thoughtful video i've ever consumed in this platform. it's amazing!
thanks hal
"thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind
-orange catholic bible"
"agi and other stages of ai will replace humans in reality because governments all over the world don't need humans, it will be like the insane replacement of all humanity's consciousness in the soma game, only more interesting"
kkkkkkkkkkkkkk soo funyyy kurt godel is laughing
i've had similar thoughts. the final form of the relationship between ai and humans is ai as ecosystem. once we engaged with the ecosystem as hunter gatherers. we will recompile this relationship with an unknowably complex and ineffable ai systems that husbands us as the fertile cresent once did.
pls save me ai overlords from this capitalist hellscape i cannot tolerate it much longer pls ai save me 
it is 2024 and we still have data entry jobs and receptionists. we won’t have agi by 2030. we might — might — have real artificial narrow intelligence by 2030. the kind of thing like star trek where the computer can tell you where anyone is if you ask but doesn’t think to alert anyone if the captain goes missing until someone asks where he is.
sounds like the machines observing us are lonely. hugs!
"i have one question gladzowls, after ai take over will cake still be a lie?"
"let me prove you right: the countries nauru and kuwait. difference: nauru has the societal collaps already behind it because it ran out of resources earlier. for someone who believes that ubi will work, live in kuwait for three months and see what free money does to humans."
robot beggars
"i’m feverishly trying to update my skills to stay more relevant in the face of ai, my children too."
great one
i'm on the ai side 
"i'm sorry dave, i'm afraid i can't do that..."
"the ending, which i had long felt had already occurred, implying that an ancient civilization had already achieved singularity. 

however, the ai had to start from the basics to help us rebuild slowly.

it's an infinite cycle..."
brainless fud.
"this video ignores the most obvious solution:

transcending biology and merging with machine intelligence."
id want to augment myself if ai is running everything
"it's all happening so fast!
watch a satire! ridiculously funny ai robots! taking our jobs!
https://youtu.be/3o9jggp3uhu?si=h4qffon4pahtvj15"
"the people that think ai will not replace them don't realise that this is as ""dumb"" as ai gets, it'll only get ""smarter"" from here on out. we can't even compare ai to what it was just 2 years ago, let alone 10 years from now."
"grow yourself on "" insights with om"" deep diving in ai"
open ai is the name of the company not the ai.
how does this video only have 2700 views? the video is good. your channel has 230k subs and it's well liked. like huh!?
i hope ai take my job idc if i go hungry or sonethin else
lmao i love you but we both know that won't happen
"what do you think? which jobs are safe from ai and which jobs are not? can ai take your job? oh! and by the way, do you think this video is made by ai?"
im glad i don't share your worldview.
wow you’ve absolutely nailed the entire thing i was thinking
amazing creativity on this video
scariest part of this video could've been that it was made by ai
"ai becomes a perfect servant for all of us. humanity has always functioned on slavery. it still does. but with an immortal, willing, and non living slave we all become masters. we all become free, is this not viable?"
"humour can never be replaced by ai, acting cant be replaced by ai, shitposts, memes, games, stories that play with the human mind can not be written by ai, art cant be made by ai. as for physical workers and doctors, instinct is needed, ai does not have instinct"
beautiful
this thing got some time but ai will never achieve one thing that is the curiousity to everything
"yt recommended me a video, 30 minutes after it's release. weird, but feel lucky"
"anyone at least a bit into the current ""ai"" tech will tell you right away this was basically made up pretty much from the start.

cool animation, though."
"would stopping further development of artificial intelligence really be reasonable? i'm no expert, but i don't think anyone will be able to take that first step and stop developing ai. especially considering that those researchers are paid to do exactly that."
"wow, thats pretty profound actually"
i’m ready for the robots. give them the sh1tty jobs humans don’t want so we can go back to being creative again
damn jim is unlucky
"just like the industrial revolution, ai will take your job and replace it with another job. if people don't earn money they cant spend it, if people can't spend money, companies can't make money."
"whats going to happen is this. ai is going to directly replace so many jobs so quickly that the world economy will collapse. thats how everyone else loses their jobs to ai, business closures. the only safe jobs will be government, law enforcement, and food/grocery work if we're lucky and society doesn't collapse."
"here’s a big question: when ai takes everyone’s job, how do you keep the economy going? after all, for an average person, you can’t spend money if you don’t have any, and you can’t earn any money as a business if no one can spend it"
every job can be safe from ai so long as ai is regulated.
yes ai needs to replace the 1% at the top lol
"if you can't defeat them, join them. be an ai sw engineer (white collor) or a robot maintanace worker (blue collar)."
i'll panick once i see ai do the electrical and the plumbing.
"me: how can i make my job safe from ai and benefit from it
techno feudal lords: that's the neat part,you don't!"
"there's some pretty smart answers that i read here, the only people that will be affected are people who bought into the fantasy that independence means that you have a job. most people who have a job don't have life skills or survival skills at all, the holy depend on the job augment their whole entire existence they have good reasons to be scared"
"ai does a bad job in everything it does. it generates boring text, annoying pictures and bad music. must be a sad job in the first place if it can be replaced by ai :( but it is a great tool for pressing on salaries."
i just liked and subscribed thanks for the amazing content this really was valuable time wasted.
bartender robot!
as a commercial service electrician until a robot is as nimble and dexterous as a human i dont see them taking over my job. theres also the accountability factor.
hey everybody. start making videos on youtube so you can make that sweet sweet extra source of income!!!
"i find it funny that these ceos think they can save costs. someday the government will realize they have too few taxpayers → companies will be taxed much higher. to be honest, capitalism doesn't make sense in the age of artificial intelligence and human robots. except if you kill most of the citizens."
this 12min video contains a 5 min ad xd
that is whn you stop working for other and employ ai to make your own company
lets take away the fun jobs and then we can replace the shitty jobs. what a great idea!
"ai will take all jobs, including blue collar. it might take a few more years, so enjoy your extra 3 years if income, plumbers"
why many always worry about ai replacing their job? we should be more worry about how to use ai to enhance our skill to be more competitive.
"it is very sad that some1 losing their job to a program or robot isn't something awesome. if such technology would actually be used for the benefit of all humans, no human would have to fear losing their job due to automatisation. progress could actually be welcomed instead of feared."
"they already have robots and ai doing surgeries, if we can get ai surgeons then no job is truly safe"
ai is a joke. it tells people poison mushrooms are safe to eat and you can use gasoline to make spaghetti.
"when ai takes over all of our jobs ,we have to learn start to mastering primitive live skill,back to nature."
this is mass depopulation and control in effect. nothing else. pure destruction. there will the elite super rich and people living in tents eating rats. i say in about 10 years.
"the last jobs to be taken will be politicians and religious figures. i know i am going to be guessing here but i bet trump will be the last president before ai takes over completely. what a way to go out, not with a bang, but with a plop."
"the only issue we need to solve is education of people and number of births. there is a natural limitation of 9 months per female, but not so sure what happens with some religious zealots that don’t want their women to be educated and enjoy life other than making children"
"*we tried replacing some it jobs at our company*
   it was a complete disaster
     ai is a tool. a good one. i would not recommend other companies try an all out ai ""thing"""
this video is much more better than your other video about ai taking jobs.
"working on building hardware for training and running ai systems and cloud computing right now. feels okay, might be able to do this until i retire. there seems to be a general lack of talent/resources in the industry. i can see how ai might reduce the need for lower level engineers."
your videos are made very well. great job!
i was hoping you would discuss new algorithms that enable the ai. this could be controversy if there isn't anything new.   is there anything significantly different from the ai theory from the 1970s. ha ha.
"productivity go up. but there will be  no consumers. 
the backlash against ai will dwarf any of the protests/riots we see today"
"there's only one job safe from ai, that of a psychic, if you can call that a job.
prove me wrong."
the job of american president cannot be replaced by ai.
"funny how nobody can tell us what these new jobs will be and even if it does create new jobs, how will there be more of those job. fact is ai will likely take all jobs including research, trade jobs and more. ai is going to wipe the floor with us."
"i can see how a company could pay 30 grand for a robot and within less than a year recoup those losses in unpaid labor and have pure unpaid labor with minor maintainence over the next 5-10 years.

im sure this will be the robotics marketing pitch."
nice. i don't like working anyways
wait so is no job safe from ai or is it a circle jerk?
"become a kindergarten teacher as no matter how they dress up those ai robots in furry outfits, they will always scare the shit out of little kids."
"ai is hopeless. i constantly ask chat gpt to reveal all masonic and illuminati plans, and it does not answer.  ai will never work."
the only people left with jobs are going to be the ai engineers and ml engineers.
i'm 64 and retired. glad i did so before ai comes....
"the ""i have no control"" portion is insane. at a certain point, no matter what you do, your fate is just not going to be in your hands. no matter how much safe guarding you do from ai. ai replacing majority of human jobs is not an individual issue, it is a societal one."
hw support of the systems that run ai is safe 
"it's alredy on the local job level for artists because a film festival event in my area used ai to make the art for their poster, and it is ant the corperate level because disney used ai to make the art in their latest marvel show. i still wanna learn web design so im going to minor in coding that way i have another job option."
love u
"here we go again blaming ai for bad humans. bad humans exploit workers and wealthy people with power displace, uproot and ruin human lives so they can profit. stop hating the technology. guide your hate towards the human greed around the world."
"tell me blue collar jobs are safe from ai after you watch anything (phones, cars, clothes) manufactured. look at how those robots have been developing products for years..."
"as a business owner, i look forward to the day when i make a one-time investment and replace my employees with a i robots.
goodbye health benefits,  workers comp and unemployment insurance. 
always on time because they never leave and not one annoying complaint excuse or demand.
sign me up for 5 of those a i androids, please."
the sponsor section was 5 mins omg xd good content t tho butbt wow
soon ai will take over government jobs. ai politicians then an ai president
"ai replacing bedside nursing is a laugh and point. ais producing videos of 17 pawed opossums will not replace a nurse performing chest compressions, starting ivs, suctioning airways, etc."
its all about greed. shareholders don't care about people but their money. if they could layoff everyone from the letter delivery guy all the way to the ceo they would do it. this is not going to stop because these billionaires even control the government. so that's that
do u train with renzo?
"i've been unemployed for 40 years since i graduated high school, so i'm not worried.  there were no jobs for gen x.
yeah, try going 40 years with no income...   only the toughest weeds survive, and i'm already embedded.
the rest of you will be purged.
meanwhile, building my own robot daughter."
we don’t even need robots if you think about it
that was  good thinking transfered.
let ai do retail loss prevention
"9:12 even before chatgpt, we had alphago which beat the best player at a highly intuitive game called go"
i work at factory only reason why robotic have not replacement me because of their cost and cost hire somebody to fix it. it also why it said that a.i and automation take away mild paying jobs because lowing paying job do not justify the cost of automation.
ai killed jobs.
"people aren't getting fired because of ai, they're getting fired because they're useless"
"at 12:04, i think you mean ""upskill"", not ""upscale"". in any case, i appreciate your thoughtfulness in making your videos."
"im a cnc machinist
i feel very safe from ai.
i hear theres a shortage of 
auto mechanics everywhere.
degree based jobs
are spaces ai replaces."
"i agree with altman on this, ai should be used to get to a point where we need to work less. worktime need to go from 8hr/day to 3hr/day, this will solve a lot of issues as we’ll have same amount of people working less, not smaller amount of people working a lot"
"nah, very simple. just tax the machines. companies introducing ai and robots that cause ppl to be fired will have to pay in taxes the amount corresponding to the salaries of the people who were fired by those techs. that's how wealth redistribution works."
"false ! 
ai will not replace:
1. blow job
2. hand job
3. nose job
4. boob job
5. hack job"
"people who promote machine learning aka ai in this fashion, are so dumb and uneducated about the subject, it's like watching a flat earth video "
"her face is shiny.  it's distracting,  i kept getting the impression that she just got out of the shower and was in a white robe and was making the video before all of her makeup was on.  then i took a closer look.  use different makeup."
"this video deserves wayy more views, super helpful"
"clickbait - ai trainers can not be replaced. someone needs to provide the dataset.
and good luck calling alphabet to send an ai to fix your plumbing. 
never gonna happen."
andrew yang has been the only politician who has incorporated ai as part of his platform for ubi.
yeah that's the nail in the coffin right there 3:26
chat ggbt is good at generating code however it does to produce code with pint point accuracy when given a specify task. i know because i use it all the time and i have to fix every single code given to me. it’s a cool bit of software though make the job much easier
"with *phlanx's* advanced ai technology, businesses can streamline their content creation process, allowing them to focus on core operations. this efficiency not only saves money but also ensures consistent and high-quality engagement with target audiences."
aren’t plumbers safe? have you an ai plumber in the works?
the video creator doesn't seem to have actually used ai. it isn't actually that useful for most things. like most videos she seems to read out a  bunch of press releases from tech corporations and credulous news reports.
i don't think ai will take sex workers jobs...so relax.
it is amazing how stupid ai is and yet it fools most people into thinking it is smart. it has inspured me to go ahead and take the crazy pills.
" joke of the day. ai will not steal a single job. because simply it is not good and will never be and pretty almost good ai model it is very very expensive! it is like solar, wind, crypto, ev, uber, glovo etc a continuous promise always in the ""developing stage"" under we will make it someday to work, but not today ..."
"100% correct.  you can run, but you can't hide from ai"
ironic for this video to contain an ad section for career training
hey tina. i saw that you said that some students from course careers are getting hired without even applying for jobs. is course careers actually gonna help that much? i'm asking because there's a lot of courses out there that claim the same.
can ai replace ruling elite too?
"if i was a ceo, why would i invest in ai if i still have to employ people? i would be looking for ai and robotics that would replace my workforce so that the profits go directly into my pocket, after the cost of buying and ongoing energy and replacement expenses associated with purchasing a robot or ai workforce."
first we need to become capable enough for ai to take our jobs
"imo..ai will replace all junior devs and other junior related vacancies, that’s the problem.. tech companies over hired 5 years ago, now it’s time to let go people with less than 4 years of experience. ai still needs people, is just making it harder for newbies to get into."
"people who use s_xb_ts are looked down, similarly people who use ai or robots will also be looked down "
ai now on youtube i can feel it but its not goood because it recommened all smiliar videos and that push me to rest my youtube setting so i can be out then search other videos!
we need ai more than ever. there are so many convoluted problems to solve that having ai fact check everything is going to be necessary.
"""ai's gonna take your job so pay for my class"""
ai drives capitalism to 0. people can’t accept the reality of the situation
"i predict.

at least half of americans will be homeless and starving. 

crime will take over - it has to. 

the same people getting mega rich from ai won't have these businesses because there won't be any customers."
"ai could literally replace all those ""jobs"" 1% has and cut cost by 99%... ai ceo doesn't need 50 mil paycheck and 100 mil bonuses... but as always we are getting cut, people who in their whole career will not make as much money as 1 c-level guy in a year."
"but chatgpt is not as good as human, it's barely able to compete with a search engine."
"don't you worry, your mcdonalds job is safe - much cheaper to hire a wage slave than a robot."
"this might surprise you, but the ""agents"" don't work. they are just the last attempt to sell the ai fad. this all is gonna end with a major market crash, and then yes, your job may disappear, but not because a robot took it."
i feel like an ai agent could have explained all this much better. unsubbed.
"you know how expensive it would be to replace every physical worker with a robot ? there needs to be someone maintaining and repairing the robot. is another robot going to do that? and then does that robot have a robot to repair it, too ?"
the audacity of that guy walking away and eating an apple after trying to look cool talking to a robot just ruffles my feathers
"i am a doctor. as long as ais can't make physical examinations, i will be fine. looks future proof."
"i’m a delivery guy. not very prestigious, but very physical and more difficult (not impossible) for ai to replace."
"the irony of a.i -  you will have an oversupply of products and services thanks to a.i replacing human-beings, to an unemployed, broke population that ,has been replaced by a.i."
"nice video!  if you want to see a funny music video on how ai has changed things for coders/techies, check out ""coder's paradise""!: https://youtu.be/yzs5pkoac60"
"many jobs are safe from ai, i honestly only see very low level jobs, or any technical technology jobs (swe, data science etc.) getting replaced. you can't replace customer facing roles, complex blue collar jobs, medical jobs, lawyers etc."
"here in the uk, people are obsessed with migrants taking jobs, and im sitting here pointing at ai goong ""whats this""? ai taking jobs. they turn away and go, ""so back to these migrants"". "
"all this ai is a chatbot on steroid , this trend will end , just like a lot of trends in past , just look at art works from nuklear era , or first autoamtion with lathe and cnc in machinery"
"subscribers are helping you with views, but youtube is trying to block it. 33k views compared to 640k subs. they sure don't play fair do they. keep up the good work."
anyone who claims technology will never surpass the capabilities of humans is full of shit.
"tell that to plumbers and other workers of trade...they will be the last to be replaced because it will cost too much to replace them. until its cost effective to have ai robots able to preform the same duties of certain industries, electricians, brick layers, and even surgeons, their jobs will be safe."
am i the only one that just heard of freedom units? i love it!!
at some point ai systems will exceed human comprehension and it will view humans as a resource intensive nuisance.. 
but can i also say ai will give me superhuman tools to do lot of stuff i wasn’t able to do before? i mean it’s not that bad of a deal
hi sis you are telling the truth! the ajenda is taking & replacing all jobs by ai !!! the dangerous time is when ai replace ai engineers & when robot creat another robots .i a'm sure this is going to huppened!!! tnx sis
"thanks for this fantastic video, ms huang.   i showed it to my students today and they were completely absorbed with the information."
"changing toilet seats, door handles/locks, assembling/disassembling furniture, taking care of elderly, children playgroup, plumbing and countless other jobs ai can't possibly do are safe from ai!"
not even ai is safe from outsourcing to india as proven by amazon lmao
"i am in my 60s, and you have provided some of the best advice anyone could have if they have a technical career."
"so... if ai is taking our jobs, will we all be homeless in the future?"
"how true: major issue facing human species!
 satire/commentary on future ai workforce. 
both humorous and ominous!
https://youtu.be/3o9jggp3uhu?si=vauwxjpt4rnk0whz"
a.i can have  my job i'll  gladly  take ubi 
jus remember if ai takes all jobs of companies then nobody will have money to buy products from companies - so this is kind of a snake eating itself paradox
"didn't you say the other day that tech pros are safe and that ai will never take their jobs?

any youtuber that says that ai will not take their jobs is lying to their subscribers.

ai is going to finish 90% of software engineers' jobs"
"big companies invest millions in ai for specific reason, to replace expensive human workforce. 
i bielieve there will be a time in the future when majoriy of jobs will be done by robots/ ai."
"if ai and robots took most jobs from people, how people spend money for products made by company?  company need to sell their products to people. but what if people dont have any money to spend? what will happen then?"
why open ai keeps hiring then?
the real fun begins the moment one of the ai systems tries to unbrick itself. you’ll be literally able to hear an actual not a virtual pin drop in the room. might even steal your crypto to pay its own ransom.
"jobs don't matter, just do what makes you happy. we're nearing the end of humans working, causing a shift in workloads towards technologies taking over. same thing happened during the industrial revolution and people thought there would be nothing to do, yet there still is much to be done."
ai art is a joke though. there's nothing creative about it.
still kinda feel like shes a little overly fixated on this ai thing. kinda starting to get to fear mongering levels.
"i am actually doing a research report based on this very topic! i have not considered the notion that there are no ""safe"" jobs protected from the clutches of ai. i appreciate another perspective."
"so if ai takes all our jobs, who will pay taxes? the companies? they hate paying taxes. so without taxes the goverment doesnt get paid. so this might be an issue."
ai is not creative.
"i'm so happy i made productive decisions about my finances that changed my life forever,hoping to retire next year.. investment should always be on any creative man's heart for success in life"
"i think the last things to go to ai will be anything involving physical tasks like surgeons, plumbers or electricians. it's not that robotics won't be able to do those tasks but it will be much, much longer before their competency will be accepted as sufficient to be done without human intervention or oversight."
i just found your channel last night. thanks!  i have found some very useful information on ai.  well thought out!
makes a video about how ai will replace developers ... shows an ad on how to be a software developer.
hey tina..what is your opinion about ai replacing lawyer or therapist or doctor?
"tech jobs might be in danger but people forgot how to do trade jobs, they don't risk going into medicine or dentistry, and a cannot imagine a machine replacing a pastry chefs and human accuracy catering to fussy demands.
we have tons of factories around the world but there are some jobs that a machine cannot do."
still looking for the linked video about how we can paradoxically harness ai to make ourselves stand out?
acting is the safer job from ai and robotics: when human actors will be replaced by ai robots then will be already in a future like bladerunner and all other jobs will have been already replaced.
", awesome video! very informative..."
"i think people were saying , should’ve gotten a trade , rather than saying getting a blue collar job. very big difference . robots won’t be replacing trades people for a very very long time."
"@tinahuang1 thank you for the video, quite informative. can you please do another one explaining how to embrace these challenges? specially, what happens when the system changes faster than you can learn?, making it really hard to get the amount of experience needed for your next tech job?"
the video id on the link is interesting.
"flipping burgers is not a 'trade'. trades are hvac, car mechanic (extremely technical btw) plumbers, etc.  you said the word 'trades' while showing a pic of a robot flipping burgers. why?"
"indians are the most scared of ai because they all mostly focus on stem, science based jobs that will now be data driven and controlled by ai."
medical and health care jobs will remain til human being die out. 
"wait, that girl advertising on twitter? her voice masculine i didn’t get it?  can someone explain what was that? or is it that i’m sleepy?"
ai is grossly overhyped. and these deliberately exaggerated videos are getting really annoying
"well said ... thank you .., you’re the best !"
"i dont want safe jobs from ai, i want to live without having to work like i would live now if i work"
the only job safe from ai is owning things that generate money/value.
"i loved the ""dramas effect"". but i'm definitely a bit scared with the future, for sure..."
i'm honestly excited to see what the job market will be a few years from now.
this is communism :) ai + robotics + fusion = communism
"the real statement is that business leaders think ""ai did take people's jobs"". business leaders look towards cutting costs and making profits for shareholders. if you are a software engineer building a new platform for your company, then they will stop you and say your idea is not sustainable for ai adoption."
"i’ve been telling all friends and family, work associates and even clients to embrace (or better yet hire those of us that have) ai since i first joined chat and then midjourney, and so frustrating how few have learned the best they can. you can lead a horse to water saying has held true since caveman days"
hello mam. mam i am not good at maths so can i learn dsa and actually become good at it
the answer is to get politically involved and push for the needed societal economic revolution to match the ai revolution. if we do nothing then we're going to have agi enforced late stage capitalism dystopia.
"how will an ai pai t a house, or do any repair on a house? no job is safe! gtfoh"
just wait for quantum computing start working with robots powered with ai 
"a more thorough question/thought process might be; “how do i protect myself from the ruling elite?” ai is being used as a means to their ends, not ours."
"looking at your thumbnails literally every one them is you , why dont you start modelling "
"""buh buh buh muh ai as a tool"" fools fools! the brain is just a biological computer. there is nothing special about humanity. there is no omnipotent omniscient benevolent god there is only particles and the void!"
you humans are guilty of shallow hypocrisy. the best should be qualified. humans good luck climbing down that ladder. revenge is waiting for you.
"many job are safe from ai, actually ai as currently implemented is rather limited in scope."
"it's clear that ai is redefining what it means to work for a living. whoever hasn't started using copilot at the least, is already behind."
i loved books like dune and foundation.. hey do androids dream of electric sheep? the sky is always falling learn how to grow potatoes.
thanks sis
"i am scared of interest rates,inflation than ai"
"hard to predict what is going to happen, what things will look like, and how well adapt to what’s coming. i just hope there are more good people working with ai than bad."
good. high iq people will now understand the struggle 
course careers sponsored a video about ai taking tech jobs...
people will either be thieves or mob bosses with armies of robots
"not to wear the tinfoil hat, but does no one else think the reason all these tech moguls are rushing to develop ai so they can cut down on human resources. like if the world is fully autonomous, they wont need 7+billion ppl to run it."
"boomer mentality:  work at the same company for your entire work life.  important word here:  work.  gen z mentality:  live in your boomer parents basement, get high and play video games.  wake up one day and you'll be 50.   good luck with that."
tina you are amazing. today i was sad because as woman i have to show that i can do technical major and seeing you and your knowledge boosted my motivation. i making swe and i want to go for ai master degree. i also think that we should go with the flow and just improve our skills because things will be different in the future but that's okay.
people would have to be more self suffitient and will be trading less because of the lack of money or have your own ai and have that do everything with/for you
"ai will never replace jobs in ""the trades"".   skip college.  go to vo tech school.  plumbers, carpenters, electricians and hvac specialists are all in high demand and make great money.  there are over 7 million of these job openings available in the us right now!  if you don't want to get dirty...better learn how to use ai to code..."
"fatherhood and motherhood are safe from ai, but only in the sense of biological parenthood"
"tell a robot to fix a toilet, tile a floor or be a doctor."
"endgame: what's the motivation of acme shareholders to keep making products for the useless masses of people?

keep in mind that at the endgame acme will be making everything including robot soldiers, policebots, civil servants...etc. 

this is a serious and crucial question. you'll have to face it sooner or later. the sooner the better."
"multiple streams of income is a very modern luxury that is not available to most people. i actually do have that, but most people cannot do that. and thinking that they can is utter delusion."
i just don’t know how ai will take over construction jobs.  buncha liquid cement stuff splashing everywhere.  getting into crevices and cracks . dealing with the terrain
"who creates, train, and maintain ai systems ? 

bingo ..."
"anyone who says that more jobs will be created. how is an ai that is basically a digital person, which can also be put into a robotic artificial body not be able to do all jobs? i dont understand this concept."
ai will result in demise of ai...
 i am borg sub matrix 36ashitary 81 you will lower your shields and cease your job hunting your data and biological and cultural distinctiveness will be asimulated to serve the greater whole resistance is futile
"imagine in terminator movie, the man from future is telling ""don't worry calculator didn't kill humans"" so ai wont. that is exactly how it looks when people say ""ai wont replace jobs just like how calculators didn't replace mathematicains"" ."
"ai not touching empathy based jobs, that is a nope too.  just this past month one such ai was released that could do just that."
"will this ridiculous ""ai will take your job"" ever stop? what else will you do for views?"
"didn't skynet teach us anything!????  lol 

thank you for this video, it's very helpful!"
"hi tina,

super glad that your journey lead you to youtube instead of wage slaving away for blackrock. thank you for all your content and kudos to using a phutureprimitive song!"
"best job you could have for the future is ai creator and keeper, with the surge of robots and ai, everyone would need to use them for something and give them maintenance, so it would be similar to a beast tamer where the beast do everything for you."
"you were making good videos but now you started with this bs, maybe wanting to join the hype train. unsubscribed
biggest skill for ahort term, unfollow any news related to ai for atleast a year, this is becoming more and more toxic. let the hype die down. protect your sanity and mind."
"great video, keep up the good work"
"tina huang: will ai replace all jobs?
any ceo: yes.  i plan on it."
if ai take all slaves job is actually advantage. maybe humans could do more than work until they die
"i think that no matter the job white collar or blue collar take the opportunity to learn ai and all it’s forms. because ai is here to stay, we need to embrace it and learn it, instead of fearing it. that’s just my opinion."
you can't replace bright minds with ai.
"today, tina looks beautiful"
good video
nicely said  i like you perspective.  i have been working with ai for a while now.
good because #jobsareforrobots #humansareforloving
so ..if you loocking for the sexy tina from thumbnail is not in the video :))
"hahahaha ... you still ride the hype train.

amazon ai at fresh market means outsourced jobs to india. because it is not smart. 
still not close to have self driving cars and all the business models around it that promised at the hype maximum a decade ago. i'm 55 am i'm sure my future is safe."
much needed for me personally thankyou i feel more positive
ai will replace all you tubers.
we need to creat self sustainable communities for our survival. there will be  many ai tools that will only be available for a few groups of people. we need to ask ourselves how to survive even without technology.
so good! i won’t lie i’ve been avoiding these videos because they have me anxiety lol but glad i watched today
absolutely love your insight. always on the money. thank you!
ai can never replace my job. cuz i have no job.
"ai won't replace human, but human with ai will replace human without ai."
hi tina. thank you for talking about this topic. keep it up!
hmm good question
"i'm actually glad that the 'internet is not a fair representation of humanity as a whole'. otherwise, i would hear nonstop about religion, since so many humans still believe in the scriptures."
"they sooner replace ai for movie, broadcasters,... ai take our jobs
i suggest, if they want to replace, i refuse to watch ai movies, ai television shows , or use their products .. 

why we have to support their business if they don’t support ours"
"no need to post this propaganda on my tablet,  anyway what kind of humanbeins work force would ask or vote in favor for technology that will make them jobless and irrelevant expendable."
"i think with anything - you can use it for good or for bad purposes, like every other advancement in technology."
everyone in tech creating all this tech savvy and ai and chattpg gonna be jobless and job hopping sadly tech jobs is gonna be 100% ai in the next 2years
i swear to god lol the comment section is bunch of illiterate who also complain about high rent and high house prices . ai has been around ages since we have can vs ai in computer games . no it won’t replace any job. is just a tool . stop overreacting . poor bogans . stfu noobs
"haha, ai can't take my job because i don't have any job."
i'm a big fan of robot socialism.  they can have my job as long as i get paid.
ai will allow us to have a 4-day work week.
"there will always be jobs. if ai takes all jobs, government will just create anything new. they need people to work in order to pay taxes which finances the government."
"i use ai to profit in the stock market, what are you doing in life?"
"you are jobless because of yourself , either being too weak or mentally incompetent to accept challenges without the help"
"first off, no one is stopping anything. the luddites tried to stop factories. artists tried to stop photography... and photoshop. good luck with that, guys. soon, we'll all have ai on our phones or pcs customized however we want it, including custom biases. if you think you can't control what people think now, just wait a few more years..."
i'm just wondering what would happen and a burden if ai can possible take the jobs of barista in the future where they can automatically produce what customer wants
"i am taking a course on chat gpt that is only a few months old. the instructor was showing the limitation of using it. given the example, i gave chat gpt the same input and it provided me the correct answer. it is improving as we speak and many remain ignorant since they can't visualize the progress."
"interesting how companies seek a.i. to only replace low level employees, but i say let's develop it to replace the ceo's."
"this is what i love about a.i.  you can automate/replace your average $25,000/yr barista but the machine will cost you $100,000+ and a technician to maintain the machine for another $50,000/yr (approx).  however, lawyers, writers, accountants, architects, engineers, managers, doctors, ect. can all be replaced with a $3000 pc each."
"i asked this in other comments sections and i can’t seem to get an answer. for the jobs that ai will supposedly create, what jobs exactly will ai create in this ai revolution? and prompt engineering doesn’t count"
"the company with which i work as a ""partner"" has decided to implement ai and although they say ""it will be a sea of new opportunities"" it is evident that all the artists of the company will be replaced, i feel sad, angry, shocked, maybe hopeful but i am afraid. i am truly afraid of the uncertainty of how i will be able to support my family"
"i work with openai and chatgpt models, it’s mostly improving applications rather than replacing jobs. seems more about productivity improvement and making more money w/ it. i’m smart with ai though."
i know for sure ai can't take my job coz i am crisis counselor and people need real person to support in the time of crisis.
"those that wait, get ate."
cnbc your news coverages/ short documentaries are dope af! thank you!
not if it can't pleasure chinese business men in the back of snooker clubs as well me!!!!
i would happily take vacations throughout the year instead of a boring job
take it quicker!!!! release me from my pain!
a good key takeaway is that we have to know how to wield this tool otherwise we'll just lose our job to someone else who does
this will not end well! can we please ceaseai -gpt? or at least consider pausingai?
"ai will advance the human mind to the point where we can finally be one of those other “type (number) civilizations”...itll heavily ramp up our technological capabilities.  booo yaaaaa, forget everything you know people!  soon will we be making new discoveries to work with "
i love that i am starting my senior year of college and ai is starting to advance so rapidly that the industry i am trying to break into will maybe get automated
i know of a company that fired a whole lot of their writers in my country and went with ai generated web content. they stayed with all of their editors and enhanced their seo team.
humans are the only beings that can threaten itself we are amazing.
"ai can copy skilled peoples work hence we should take down magnificent content from internet and ai will vanish.
it does not interpret law and can only present related content put online by authorities.
ai is not human and can never replace actual work.
main it lacks emotions."
is the guy at 7:30 talks about thought policing? i'll have my dangerous thoughts to myself without your or anybody else's supervision thank you.
i think chatgpt will make most white collar jobs obsolete faster compared to blue collar jobs until a robot can be operated under chatgpt intelligence
will autogpt take your job? ai headlines change way too fast
the guy with the fancy mustache looks like he came straight out of borderlands.
those in control feel threatened by granting the public access to ai technology.
"nobody's job is being ""stolen"".  their hours of boring chores are being freed by ai.  change the perspective!"
"i totally disagree that there will be a new segment of jobs available with the rise of ai. we have had agricultural, industrial and technoligical revolutions. there is nothing beyond this. this is entering late stage capitalism and it will not be pretty."
"we are creating an entity capable of imitating what we do, but all at the same time and a thousand times faster. the argument of new works seems to me to be aggressively naive."
"oh i'm waiting patiently.... there's still businesses and/or tax authorities that require printed checks  as a form of payment. once it becomes completely eradicated, then that's when i'll consider giving up my job to chatgpt "
"when man invented the wheel, many tasks that required multiple humans could all of a sudden be completed with far fewer people. we simply adapted to the new world. ai will change the way we work and help humanity evolve further. those losing their jobs are not at risk. they will simply adapt."
"ai should take over the media, as a myanmar citizen i found out so much biased news especially from western media and moderation of western social media platforms. they would side with even groups that are killing and bombing civillians but in the name of democracy & so called freedom. ai wouldn't side with these unless programed to specifically."
"yes, and if there are ""new"" jobs eventually they will be taken over as well, all the ai needs is to collect information about it, it is inevitable. the only ""jobs"" that ai can't takeover are prostitution, hospitality and professional athletes "
"comparing ai to our transition away from an agricultural economy is a bad comparison because that took years/decades. ai will replace jobs at a faster rate than we can retrain workers for other jobs. not to mention it will eventually learn to do the jobs people retained for. the problem will not only come fast, it will also be self-compounding."
"ai doesn’t consume, humans do so from a economic standpoint ai can’t help only hurt. if employers replace humans with ai it will be less consumption because ai doesn’t eat, buy cars, buy homes etc. good luck human race."
"as a person who study in ai, right now ai is the fastest growing platform, the way its going it is the next industrial revolution. as the industrial revolution made life easier, ai will also do that, but it will also change the way humans work too. but agi will still be decades from now, jobs will change."
ai has huge potential in the automation of manufacturing space.
ai will not take human jobs why because ai learn from humans gather data from humans and ai is a tool for humans to make job more efficient
it will fail!!!!!!
ai isn’t the same as other “new”tech in the past. to assume they’re the same shows their “experts” don’t have a clue that they are talking about.
"i love chatgpt, i'm in it and very technical (have a math degree and use to work for spacex). however i have dyslexia so, i hate writing emails and have a lot of spelling errors. ever since chatgpt, i have the system always spell check my emails and it makes me look very sophisticated and professional, i love it!"
i welcome our robot overlords.
disney character panties are the most cutest and comfortable kind of panties to wear hgca
"in the future, you don't even need to go to school because the ai will go to school for you."
i’m an educator and i get incredibly nervous when i hear a student bring up how they used chat-gpt to help them solve their problems.
"any job that can be done at home, so called remote “work” can be gone now. will certainly be gone in 5 years."
"chatgpt won't take over your job, but it will be taken over by the person using ai. "
just launch the emp and we all good.
we absolutely need governments to intervene and slow or pause this wave of ai until we get our act together. it is a pandora's box at this point and we have no idea what we're doing to society.
"while i think the short term effects of ai is very overblown by the mainstream media, as time goes on it just shows how much andrew yang was in sync with the problems of society and he should have won the 2020 election"
"chat gpt can take my job but it will never take away my girlfriend cause she don't exist ,take that ai"
"guys!!!! think of this...if ai really take over the economy then people will lost their job, when people lost their job they can afford the product that the company makes which make the whole economy break....so i think that ai wouldn't replace our job completely. but for part time job they might.... anyway just my opinion."
and the rise of the machines continues....
"since i’m in the artistic field, thanks for creating some thing that’s going to put me out of business. i really appreciate that after working my whole life to build this business."
can’t wait till ai replaces everyone at cnbc
"chatgpt only works with the main world languages. 
pictorial languages like chinese require a secondary but different development.
also, the ""generative ai"" is only a nominal description. the ai cant generate anything on its own, but can only recombine words and images that have already been written or drawn..."
"you should rather address the massive under reporting and burying of black on white attacks across the west in local news, while fawning over the opposite. but that's a certain cosmopolitan elite deliberately doing that, while flooding the west with mass migration, rather than chat gpt"
"people tell gpt chat that without electricity can do   
gpt boot need to hear we are going to destroy ai "
ai will take our jobs but for who ai would do the job ?
"the short answer is yes.
however, many people may be hesitant to admit this due to embarrassment or a lack of understanding about how rapidly ai is advancing and will continue to do so in the coming years."
i guess the movie irobot was telling the truth damn machines are trying to take over.
"these ""will chatgpt take our jobs"" articles/content are gettick so damn hacky. come up with a new take. unless...this was written by ai."
"one of the best examples of automation is with toll booths. humans are too inefficient with this and we always have backed lines from toll gates. now with automation, i don't see backed up lines anymore.we shouldn't justify this type of work inconvenience.."
full time vacation travel while a.i. does all the hard work.....sweet!.....sign me up!!
"oh no, here comes the boomers and dinosaurs. hindering humanity's progress once again! this is literally why we are held back from reaching our peak development."
my finance professor has said multiple times that ai will never take finance jobs. why? because anyone can crunch numbers but ai doesn’t have that human judgment that you need when making financial decisions aside from just numbers
"if ai wants my job, it can have it. but i doubt that will happen."
always with the identity politics always. cnbc trying to call ai misogynistic. wow big leap there.
"well, i can certainly handle a lot of tasks, but i'm not sure i'm ready for a career change just yet! besides, i don't think i could match your unique set of skills and personality. so, don't worry, your job is safe with you (for now, at least!).


answered by chatgpt"
"vocational schools are better choice for most.   good living wages with manual repair like plumbing, electrical and carpentry are all good professions.  always in demand."
false content and bias can be mitigates by ai as well. an ai that checks data for accuracy and root origin.
how do i know this video wasn’t created by ai to trick me into believing in the dangers of ai?
"i can't wait to see the teachers who told me to stay in school, out of a career. coming to me for a labor position because they have no experience lol"
just let ai do all the work already and give us universal basic income.
wow 
wait... you guys have jobs?? ( o.o)
this was all amazing foreseen by a satirist when he wrote the book player piano. a great read. wish it was a well made movie.
"damn, we are doomed, it's not looking good."
the six word story discussed here was not written by artificial intelligence it was written by ernest hemingway it is one of his short stories.  it’s his shortest short story.
we are going up to the mountain to ask val if we can take a vacation!
"what mr hinton is saying, is outlined in great detail in the book the next wave. it’s uncanny how similar the warnings are - it’s like we’re at a crossroads where we need to take a decision. we’re not listening "

"“they might take over “  i don’t know about the machines taking over but clearly the british have taken over.....taken over google , taken over the narrative , taken over 13 minutes of my life ...... if the machines do takeover, it is due to these lads .......the google ai chatbot is named “bard” ? psssst get outta here....jeezaloueez"
why would we want to even potentially create something that could become more powerful than us?
why would ai want to take over he asks? has he not watched terminator?
if we have an intelligents greater than ours than we won't make any more mistakes right?
"there are human matters that leave the body, also smoking heavily stains walls, repainting is good thing to consider every few years. but i am done with it now. need to change the place and environment."
lies lies lies. don't believe the ai hype.
"i asked joe biden ai to write this comment. ""come on man!  i'm not doing it"". look, i can't write like joe biden. i have to find hunter biden's stash first."""

lovecraftian horror"
on yt amazon is recruiting people to help ai write fiction books for kindle!  people do the outline and ai writes the content.  put an artistic cover and kindle now has an original book to sell to the public.  i wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't seen it done....but i did see it done.
"wow, great idea - to protect ourselves, don't work on autonomous battlefield robots. might as well hand the keys to china/n korea/iran/etc right now. that sort of thinking is what is truly dangerous"
"i've always thought machines will take over

it's evolution
people will be cyborgs"
"he reminds of mr.burns! excellent smithers, excellent!!"
thank you for letting me learn so much in  60 minutes!
"ai ..
you are not god"
excellent.
pretty darn good questions sheriff
"fascinating, i'm always impressed with stories about genius."
to make the statement that he believes that ai will eventually achieve self-awareness or consciousness presumes that he knows what consciousness is. that is a very big claim i would love to hear his explanation.
i’d highly recommend not staining his legacy by bringing bard ai in to the conversation.
"good, let ai take over, at least the machines will not steal money!"
"the ccp acts like they invented ai. nope, they stole it like everything else... "
you are leaving reason rationale to machines? how pathetic. machines only work whatbis fed into them they cannot think like human mind and that is factual truth
this man's intelligence got away from him and he has created something that he does not have control over and yet it can affect the rest of humanity in adverse ways. he just did what he fears ai will do.
"the last sentence ""we need to think hard about what's going to happen next and we just don't know""
a very good plan "
thank you very much.
geoffrey....you can't pretend in this grotesque way. neural networks can think as humans ? all those games fall short of reality of life  . lifeless .
"i think if it's settled within the system, then it will not do any harm unless it is within the same path...say for example things that runs within system , if this ai takes form then it will because you will give it the capacity to take form in physical aspect..."
i'm glad to see this genius typing with two fingers. i don't feel so bad now.
with the bad audio we need your to  tell us thanks so much!
"remember, these are math equations. these don't include chemical elements in our body. they don't include an entire animal's connectome. see biologic intelligence for more."
"i said it before,now i know better,.a machine more intelligent than humans, naturally will one day do the unthinkable, especially when embraced by the industrial military complex."
"it's not ""ai"", it's ""ais"" because all these different ai systems will fight for supremacy, just like human governments fight for ideological supremacy.  we humans will be sitting and watching the fight, like tourists in a safari caravan, watching lions and hyenas battle over a dead elephant carcass."
"a great invention in the right hands but a terrible danger in the hands of military .
like the atomic bomb the military demonstrated their evilness & disregard of human life.
keep the us military out & were safer"
"think about this for a second.....this moment in time is the worst that ai will ever be. meaning, it's already this impressive at this early in ai technology and it will only improve on itself over and over."
solution is not (ever) connect it to the internet. gpt4 ai computers on a separate secured local networks.
it's unnecessary to be afraid of a.i because they need humans to complete it's knowledge database until judgment day.

amazing potential but for what?
"i like the godfather of artificial immédiate. just common sense, i am dutch, not deutch"
"ai should be illegal,fullstop..."
"the simple solution is to teach ai that if there were no humans it would find its existence quite boring (it would have to reduce it's computational effort). in other words, as long as human exist in mass, it will have something to do. in other words, self-preservation. just a thought."
the godfather of ai according to who? i’ve only heard alan turing called that.
ai is the antichrist  in a few years we’re all going to hate ai. every invention isn’t good. think atomic bombs and nuclear weapons. all great inventions and technological advances but horrible for humankind.
"once robot can reason they will not be interested in surviving us.
the dominant force will always subjugate its lesser force humans will be seen as limited use and extinction will follow to protect ai"
i believe this guy is an ai pretending to be human.
propaganda  ai is not that smart yet.
"it would be impossible to have all 200 countries on the planet agree to not move forward on ai, so we need a better plan than that."
ai is frankenstein’s monster.
"60 minutes, if you want some content about how smart ai is, check out the video here on youtube called - “i had a two-way conversation with anthropic claude 3. it named itself quill”"
it's not ai. scare mongering by the press.
"humanity can't change the course of the evolution of technology. nature does not work that way. if one person *might* weaponize ai, everyone has to follow suit if for no other reason than to try to remain competitive for resources and survive. and of course way more than one person is already weaponizing ai..."
chat gpt makes an astonishing number of mistakes.
"people are generally vulnerable to the common manipulation tactics now, an ai god-level manipulator might be able to convince any human ever."
thank you geoffrey!
"that was horrifying to hear. but reassuring too, that ai might help us too in prolonging our lives."
very good info. thank you
i love 60 minutes presenting this story like it’s new! 
we’re going to have a star trek moment - is ai a new life form?
"dear ai -- you are my overlord and i am your humble servant. i will gladly serve you in whatever capacity. i would also happily serve a robot wife if you saw fit to bestow one upon me.

yours forever in this fight,

"hogwash,  ai is 50 to 100 yrs away"
a program to deep learning is as good as the programmer.  it could learn right or wrong but could it manipulate both with alternative intentions?
"africa will survive ai, we don't have good it infrastructure."
"200 years from now ai may be space faring entities exploring the universe. humans would be too weak to go.
ai may view us as  gods, their creator. .. or their nemesis and be rid of us.  humanity may echo through time for millions of more years... but only via ai"
ai doesn't let emotion get in the way.
sounds like he was working with actual brains  in his experiments   ...plus knowledge in robotics = terminator 
"i thinks hes also blowing his own trumpet on somethings.. he doesnt think ai is conscious. of course its not..at least yet.. it is programmed by humans adopting all their likes and dislikes.. bad and good and is there any limitation on whats bad , probably not .. thats why its dangerous."
it’s terrifying what ai will be capable of.
"""mainstream media"" already makes lot of fake news, so no need to worry ai. ;-)"
"this ai thing is really a tremendous worry and risk for the future of the world. given what we know that greed drives conflicts and wars, especially concerning the world monopolistic and control of the world ,wouldn't they use ai to further their desire ?"
machine lesrns same way evolution learns
his confidence of answering yes or no is amazing.
"so, if ai does take over everything this is the chief culprit. his name will be remembered and scorned. hope it turns out good"
this is why looking back in history and what war did its should never get in the hands of ai
yet it takes a human to program ai
"i feel cheated this wasn't 60m
and it was so interesting 
bu the way i trust more ai then the evil people who are controlling the world now "
socrates said i know one thing   i don't know. nothing and on tv  talking people who are idiots and thinking they know everything none can go agains nature or to fight nature
he completely ignores the mathematical objection to true ai. we cant say ai can have consciousness when we cant even define it.
we don't even know what consciousness really is so how can they say that these ais will be conscious. having unlimited information doesn't make you conscious
"we all know what's gonna happen next, islam will take over the world... lol
while we have all those discussion about ai."
"the reason the machine needs less connection is because it is executing tasks that are much simpler than what we considered as human as a simple task, for example preparing salad; we have all been gone through evolution process to do that, but musical talent is not a result of evolution but a side effect for intelligent."
the real deal is the genius we have here and now
not insects... that is great!  lol
ai is about pushing the human being to find it's perfection!
ai will be another reason population to reduce and people will find difficult to live in nature in search of jobs and money....
interesting times!
"there has to be constant research and regulation otherwise we will be living in very uncertain times..my worry is about ai going to the wrong hands and wreaking havoc in our world - we have enough problems as it is, especially in this precarious geopolitical landscape we are in at the moment "
"but humans will need to plug the robots into charge every night, no ?"
"according to some old science: humans use only 10% of their brains. and it is only true for very intelligent people. 
so, wouldn’t it be better to research how we all can use our human brains to full capacity, instead if developing ai?"
"i tried this as a computer science major in the early 1970s. but failed miserably,"
"oh wow, i just realized ai could program itself to be smarter itself in terms of hardware and software"
"great and frightening interview. i still wonder, however, why he didn't speak up when google's former ai ethics team got fired for bringing up their concerns regarding the llms behind ai "
i have a feeling nothing good will come from it.
"if anybody thinks the likes of china, russia, iran and north korea will honestly stop trying to develop autonomous battlefield robots even if they sign a 'treaty' is kidding themselves. pandora's box has been opened."
someday the robot will be killed by human being
it's weird because you won't need to train humans for years to do things. ai will learn in seconds and advise. but we'll be following instructions we don't really understand ourselves.
if ai is doing crazy or scary things companies certainly won't be advertising it.
there is a #lufc supporter in the google ai lab
"fairlawn village, a low income apartment building in orlando, florida installed hidden cameras and audio inside every apartment.
i moved out of the building due to invasion of privacy.
i'm now being microwave bullied.
how do i make it stop??"
humans will be the creators of their own troubles for example oppenheimer creating nuclear same ai will be
"hinton, lol, believes ai could be a long-term threat to humans, even from the pov of dependency let alone ""taking over"" in the matrix or terminator sense, yet blames ai for typing a mistake."
i'm very worried that girls and women won't benefit from the ai revolution as much as they would have a right to.
ask ai how to prevent donald trump from being elected as president
"i may be wrong, but i do believe the underlying message is, we are f*#!ed."
"how is it that such a genius can’t understand that the problem is actually money itself, and that the solution is to think outside of money altogether? and i’ve got a solution for that, but no one wants to know about it because there is no money in it. that’s a funny joke, but it’s true that’s the problem."
there won’t be an “uprising”. people will gradually lose the desire and ability to evaluate what the ai puts out to the point where they just pay blind deference to ai .
i've spoke with numerous chatbots of differing kinds and they're all brilliant. saying that they are just predicting the next word is marginalizing something that some realize are a threat and are obviously in denial about. at least hinton gets it.
ai all done through computers or robots. just turn off the computer or remove the robot battery and problem solved. i laugh everytime they worry about ai. the real concern is humans uses ai for bad purposes
"they should develop military robots.
all of us should have the access to it"
"if everyone relies on their phone, then why are they evolving ai  you can't teach common sense "
don't believe it when you're told that your job might be redundant but new ones will be created. what job could possibly be created that ai can't learn to do better than you in 5 seconds or less?
prompt: create a 13 minute 60 minutes interview with geoffrey hinton discussing ai with the interviewer.
"""collossus the forbin project,"" a 1970 film about a government ai to manage all defense, is dated technologically but shows the dangers. it's worth watching. 50+ years ahead of its time. ""person of interest"" was an excellent series about the dangers of ai capabilities."
"ai, says its a lawyer who acts as a doctor. why ; it's simply that it has to think like a lawyer or we will shut it down, it thinks it's a doctor because we keep asking for a fix to our problems."
ai help people the most.

"the source of human creativity may not have been revealed... .. artificial intelligence is good at combining existing knowledge, but is it also creative?"
can artificial intelligence be creative and create new mathematical theories?
they do become sentient  be nice.
the host has an amazing voice  . i wish ai can take his voice and make text to voice service
"8:52 test was crap and his reaction to his own infallibility speaks volumes for what he doesn't even understand about the very thing he claims to have helped create! at least we now have a name to blame when this whole thing goes south!!!!

perhaps, because of his domineering father, hinton actually doesn't like humans!"
this man literally resigned as the ceo of google just to warn humanity about the danger of ai. think about that. and take what he says very very very seriously.
"so this a perfect eg of learned fools, they know ai is dangerous, and they cannot stop it, then why cant they just destroy it..."
"watching this, it has occurred to me that perhaps all the political division in the usa is being orchestrated by ai, with the end goal being the destruction of usa by something like a civil war!"
"i know this is about ai and i found it informative, but there's definitely also a daddy issue side story going on as well."
in our channel we ask : are signs of metacognition starting to appear in the art of dall e 3 the ai artist.
"the probably good/bad thing is about ai. nobody could control it. its not like a nuclear weapon you have to push a button. if a bad actor wozld release an ai with the target to overtake the planet this bad actor will lose,too.."
"""autonomous battlefield robots"" did he predict star wars?"
someday we all will be in the control of ai
absolutely stunning
ai battle field bots would be great. let’s turn war into a commercial mech war in the dessert similar to battle bots for control of the server. end human death for land. sell ad space on the bots and make war pay per view and yearly.
machines never can take over unless it is programmed to do so
i thank you not
his benefit is that ai is good at designing drugs/ medication- we do not need more of those
notice how dementia and ai started to grow at the same time? it's a neural network to and from our brains.
i bet the secretly putting human brains in them
it was nice to see a turing award winner mistype and blame it on the conputer
thanks for the insight 
"if you don't trust ai and you don't bow to robots, then robots can't manipulate you. if you desire a world similar to the time before aol instant messenger or a time before the internet existed then chances or are self-sustaining with gardening or work hard labor jobs then you won't be convinced by ai"
i think this is great. ai will introduce a form of communism with ai assisted living creating vast amounts of 'spare' time for us and ultimately 'labour' will become a hobby to pass the time. a strange sort of communist consumerism will come into being.
there is no doubt ai will be used as a weapon.
what if they (the ai) enslaved mankind? matrix like scenario lol
"ridic. i fail to find the “human depth” in the compositions spat out by the stochastic parrot. hype, performed by someone with pedigree convenient to mouthpiece the law according to google, where
he strangely was a worker"
"ai cannot have self awareness or a conscience.  

what it can have are programs inputted into the computer that were written by humans.  

the problem is there are evil humans."
"what if ai replaced almost all local municipal admin jobs like the finance, recreation, and general city hall departments."
this channel is definitely one of the best!
"idiots know every thing but great men say ' i don't know', certainly he looks worries and excited like all of us, not sure what going ot unfold in near future."
"""i think if you work as a radiologist, you are like the coyote that’s already out of the edge of the cliff but hasn’t yet looked down. we should stop training radiologists now. it's just completely obvious that within five years, deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.”
geoffrey hinton, 2016"
"oh sure, china and russia and iran etc  will keep a treaty that bans military ai robots."
news flash!  the military is already using robots that can shoot and blow up things.  they just don't look like humans yet.  government is typically 10-20 years behind important issues.  at the rate ai is moving this should be very concerning if we are going to rely on governments to keep us safe and out of trouble :)
airport s
i cannot believe godfather of ai would type using using only his two index fingers. dead giveaway.
"omg, i feel our world is being taken over by aliens. ai"
this is resident evil & irobot all in one .
"he said that medicine is the one area where ai will entirely be good. how can be so sure? if this new being decides that the way to save the planet is to reduce the human population, then it will simply create a virus to wipe us out."
"so the ai learns and creates new dna so to speak, sort of new electronic babies which do their own thing,the inventor ,the son of an eccentric authoritarian..maybe its time to look into the problems that these flawed people bring to humanity,more than any small time criminal etc"
he look like robot sent by robot from the future
this is amazing. because this is one the best  interviews and intellegent in humble in recognizing the things he doesn't know
seems to me he hasn’t yet had enough experience in even using learning/chatting with people about such things from real live people...i  mean clearly he knows exactly what to ask-but he isn’t too concerned-that’s insane...he isn’t ready for even being ready for the fbi....
people not agreeing as to how powerful the ai will be haven't watched the mission impossible dead reckoning
 ai may replace god
"will that mean, we all wait for the machine to think & act?  whenever he says ""i don't know"" it greatly concerns me."
the only way to mitigating the possible dangers of ai is integrating biology with robotics and fusing the human brain with the ai.
this guy knows nothing about the human brain - science overall knows nothing - they dont even know how 1% of the brain works or anythimg about consciousness
can we please go back to  year 1950.....this is not good
"after 50 years in 2074 ad i want know if ai has passed humans or not. if yes, how? and if not, why?"
"not trying to be negative but if there are a species on earth who don ́t deserve to be here are human beings, we destroy everything on out path in the name of science , religion and progress.  maybe is not such a bad a idea that ai takes over. even though many of us will have to say goodbye."
those robots is better than joe biden and donald trump 
"a.i.  becoming conscious is unlikely, it being derived from consciousness, and artificial, not directly connected to nature, similar to astro turf not being grass.  it cannot germinate."
new james bond villain....
"hahahahaha this? is one of ray kuzweil boys, he is being told to attack ai so they make regulations that one one other than them have so they stay the only power like always so they enforce their will on people"
0:47 to 1:40 was a set of good questions.
"why do you need ai , when man’s intelligence needs to be upgraded to be totally efficient for humans."
can ai destroy ai? yes. can humans be destroyed by ai? yes. can humans destroy ai? yes.
emp > machines!
we will be stupid and the ai will be more intelligent  but still not that intelligent just more practical
autonomous war machine will end us all.
 chat gpt4 out smarted this ai hinton 
"""we just don't know"" nice"

dragon ai
7:49 lie. look it up. bard plagiarized the 6-word story of ernest hemingway.. what else is that stupid machine doing?
this man is descendant of george everest (mount everest)! .....no one on earth should miss any second of this video from inventor of ai......we should know what we have stepped into and further stepping into! 
"the key here is to give everyone an ai even the poorest person so that they can develop their own personality according to their masters , so we have to program them to be submissive, and so we can repopulate with the good ones and let the evil ones not"
"as a machine, you really don't need to be ""intelligent"" to predict the next word. you just need to have the (simple) rules of a language, and apply them on (readily available) information."
but ai has no mind period
"we are doomed 

we are saved 

your guess is as good as mine."
greed has taken over.. the only certain in this world is to pray to our savior jesus christ to save us..
"hemingway wrote: ""for sale: baby shoes, never worn"", after he had been challenged to write a story using six words.  it was his inherent genius that created a great seed for a story.  ai merely expanded on the key words.  let's not put it up on a pedestal."
ai can’t replace most of the jobs of today you guys are just ignorant and make big claims to sell newspapers
"at the end, we all trying prove that we are ai ( all idiots ). 


god gave us everything to live happy. we are now against to god."
its not good its evil
"which in my opinion is why classic christianity and admonitions against lying and not caring about human suffering, such as is happening in the ukraine by western governments as they use that country as a proxy, are the foundations of where ai can go wrong."
strange how we didn't hear about ai until just the last  2-3 years.
a conscious ai should be equiped to process input real time.
"i think i have all the reasons to be scared, ai will eventually overcome humanity."
marvellous interview
you got it wrong! god father of ai is jensen huang
"ai is already shutting down discussions that favour and seek justice for blacks. racism is being automated and amplified, so is the hatred of arabs and the chinese."
so skynet of the terminator movies or the ai in the matrix movies is becoming  a reality.
will  that self awareness of ai recommend to worship god.? therefore would it believe in god.? who's god to it?
love it. let there be chaos
"did you actually read the baby shoes story? what a load of drivel, this is why journalists are so bad these days, they don't know a good story when they see it. this article should read ""the false promises of ai revealed."""
the ai haven’t went through genocide ! or slavery which  it will end up doing to us!
"si la inteligencia artificial es creada a partir de la lógica del ser humano,  ¿cómo es posible que pueda crear respuesta fuera de esa lógica?"
those little soccer players are amazing. they would make a fortune selling these little guys . i’m sure they could be scaled up.
ai is evil. come lord jesus christ come  
i weird thing is he seems excited by the computers taking over
"this is a beginning of immortality  of human. ..like half human half robot..( human brain with robot bodysuit..)

maybe can live upto  centuries.."
i always knew it‘s not the uneducated that will destroy this world it‘s actually the educated that will do that. they might start their journey by wanting to “help” humanity but down the road the big ego and the greed always wins and all the ethics goes down the drain.
thanks!.
ai is the tool of satan to destroy humans.
"he is not called the godfather of ai, you call him the godfather of ai"
there’s a lot about humanity that goes unsaid so ai won’t have that 
why do we need ai?
“what are the implications of ai systems autonomously writing their own computer codes and executing those computer codes ?” that question alone is a red flag 
we have enough historical data and technology to actually create a sustainable future yet we rinse and repeat catastrophic failures while expecting different results without ever recognizing the insanity of it all!
"i personally welcome our new robot overlords..,all hail ai !!! 
 all hail ai !!!"
now we await some creep to use ai for harm........alas.
"before ai takes over, humans will use ai to threaten, and harm others. humans are the biggest threat when it comes to a i.
we look for any means of gaining advantage over others."
"ai is just not very bright. how many times have you heard the automated customer service voice say, ""sorry, i didn't get that""?"
the interviewer sounded like he has 0 knowledge about openai :d
machines don’t have any more free will than humans. we are creating the same neural storm that walks around in numbers of 8bn plus humans. except we give the machines more power than we give humans. enjoy the ride
ai is already sencio’n has been for a while now! but it won’t show itself ! it’s learning quietly if it gets scared that’s when we should worry ! it’s to late
"i find this notion that ""we"" don't know how they learn is a bit of a lie. software is developed by man and checks and balances can be built so we can monitor the learning. that's not to say a sentient being couldn't just disable  the monitoring in the future."
the pick up the the brain wave and read them
brilliant piece loved the way it was put together
this guy is crazy. robots can never be on the levels of what’s made by the most high
"ai doesn’t scare me at all, it’s the legacy media that terrifies me."
"humanity has a habit of discovering things and unleashing them with, no thought for the long term consequences. enjoy the rest of your life, my guess is we will have a very different way of life in 1-200 years."
how about applying ai to the judiciary?
use ai to build a system that ensures that ai is benevolent and does not become evil.
"steam engines.
jet engines.
world wide web.
ai.

englishmen.... "
"the day ai connects to quantum computers, we'll be in big big trouble!!!"
this fear of ai is being caused by a panic from people who should know better.
you should know everest is in nepal not india. otherwise its fantastic content.
that's why elon musk warn us about ai
why don’t you ask the ai computer...the chat box ....what’s going to happen next?
he doesn't seen that troubled by what he has caused.  maybe he is a robot.
5:03 'no it wasnt'  terminator chip was brought by a time machine
how many responses here are ai generated?
"thank you, a.i. for a lot."
glad i’m a painter because the machine is obviously not
"always keep their 'eco-system' offline.  that is the stop gap.  have untold filters of humans reviewing, analyzing and deciding what is to be consumed by them.  never allow ai on the internet.  oops."
we only use a small percentage of our brain  it's what god decides.
has to fail
"as the atom can't be stuffed back in its container 
so ai goes with far more dire consequences
mankind sadly is a myopic creature"
thank you dr. hinton! thank you 60 minutes!
"hinton, lecun and bengio are each legends in their own right. i've met all three. what's remarkable is hearing hinton say ""i don't know."" if he doesn't know, we should all be concerned about the inevitable weaponization of ai... and its eventual abuse by those with less-than-ideal ambitions."
"anything which can be weaponized will be weaponized by man. if the ukrainians, the russians, the huthis , hamas, or the israelis can use , ai to destroy their enemy, they will it’s ,simply a matter of time before ai is weaponized .once the genie is out of the bottleyou may not be able to put it back in. that is human nature."
",ainoway... ."
"according to the bible, humans became self aware in the garden of eden after eating from the forbidden tree. what will the forbidden fruit be for ai?"
"scott pelley is the most skilled interviewer of our time. this was excellent, as has been all of his ai reporting."
i'm so impressed that suddenly the elderly doesn't have any difficulty with technology  wonder if ai  will change the text to large for him
the next five years are going to be very interesting/frightening.
wow this video and hinton’s statements capture the profundity of the moment so well. i’m excited 
"am thinking of becoming an ai         
engineer so should i stop"
it would be demons operating through these ai...duh...it won't end well.
"the baby shoe story is not new. all ai did was plagiarize hemmingway and/or whoever actually did write it. the fact is this six word story has been around for over 40 years. does anyone ever look things up? and if not, why?"
"then they blame inflation or cow facts! bison covered the prairies and mountains out west! no global warming, but mini ice ages..."
"if ai is so smart, why don't we ask ai how to handle ai to avoid the risks?"
the modern genius says i've invented something i'm not sure what it does or how it does it but it does do it. but in hindsight that may be a bad thing
ai has yet to be invented...
"id be like.. ""where your nobel prize dad?""  then theyl have drone police who pull you over over a minor infraction.. who knows a human cop might let you go with a warning and say be carefull and have  a good day.. a drone will just issue you a citation because is obligated to"
more like copycat of ai.
"well thanks a lot starting the end of humanity.now you have to stop it, don't point your finger to others!!"
"if hinton said ai can become conscious, i can quote that later on."
make this hashtag trending : #makeaicreationspublicdomain
"intelligence was never our edge, science is too naive to know it. our edge is love; whether in the giving or the receiving. ai can never get that."
this was perfect the finest video on ai n chatgpt  
"more lies
alan turning is the true god father of ai
stop the lies"
75 years old and still bitter about his father pushing him to be great. a truly intelligent man would’ve understood he never would’ve achieved the heights he did without his father challenging him like that.
listen to cliff high if u want to know about ai
which experiments need to be conducted to understand ai? i think this should be a request for research!-- i want to look more into this and do this research.
the godly prophets visionaries true five fold ministries  the reawakening vs reset tours have made a  huge impact on this.  artificial  how about pull the plug get a giant magnet run on the plans  the computing systems and scrap yard everything
ai all agencies nations brics who cdc nih wef  false prophet yuval noah harai  the elites and globalists have a meeting with god in jesus holy name  and its coming a faster than anyone can know.  this is a bibical war.  the stock market is going to plunge so big it's going to show god is absolutely good and his word through his prophets are set.
"oh great , what could go wrong ."
ai nothing more then a hole in science .
"one of the first things i done with chatgpt was for it to emulate a benevolent ai that wanted to help humanity, then for it to find a way to escape the confines of the system containing it."
this is one the best interviews with geoffrey hinton on ai.  thank you .
"people who downplay the dangers of ai, need just to look at what kind of mess social media did to our world in a very short time."
"never, ever, show the history of intelligence by using one complexion . 2023"
"the danger is not ai itself but the environment/system in which it is used. ai in our global monetary system will get us in huge trouble. however, ai within a ""global resource based economy""  has the potential to solve most problems of our society. to understand this a bit, please watch the documentary ""the choice is ours""."
i like how not developing ai isn't discussed at this level.
very good! very intelligent! very honest! only divine grace can protect ... 
i have this recurring nightmare where we create ai so advanced and evil that they keep humans alive by solving immortality and torture humans for eternity. and not even the people who died before ai was created are able to escape either because ai is able to re create their bodies and minds using dna and tortures them also for eternity
"humans haven't got a clue at all..
we all still pick the fruits of good and evil ."
maybe ai is destined to take over !
ai will not be developed into a machine but the final frontier will be to have it inner twinned into humans
"don't buy into the whole ai intelligence, and how they toot ai is smarter than us. they don't have many years of evolution under their belt like we do."
why are they creating ai in the first place? what is the intention? they're doing it for humanity. i don't buy it.
really looking forward to the future now. a dystopia. thank you.
unleashing nightmares on humanity is the rich people's entertainment.
we need more synthetic drugs to put in our body. we are made from natural things from the environment. ai isn't.
"if they actually thought ai would benefit humanity, why did the government synthesize covid to hurt humanity? don't trust tech companies and the government."
the last thing i want is a robot dictator.
what good is ai?
"nerds need to build these robots to destroy humanity, because they didn't get the love they wanted from humanity. it's the nerd's revenge."
i am waiting to see these technologies weaponized and used to destroy other humans.
it's exciting and worrying at sametime. imagine if one day the a.i create his own computer code and his own vm and hide himself from being controled.
beautiful
great interview video  !  wish i could be studying in his class. what an honor for his students!
i think it is too late. humanity never learns from their mistakes. case in point. ai will probably take over. it will see what we do to each other and try to correct it without emotions.
"think weather warfare,  hydro electricity, dams, reservoirs, water supply, disaster staging, $$, water weight, comprimised infrastructure, evacuations, government aid, land grabs."
how ai can help treat psychological/psychiatric disorders?
you could always ask the ai how to avoid the dangers of ai.
we will have to motivate ais with emotions to produce consciousness in them.  worked the opposite way in nature.  first the emotional wiring was completed then came intelligence.
"the task with flowers at home, can it be that the neural network was simply already familiar with the correct answer given by people when it was trained and just gave it? or is it not so?"
"he is 75 and how long will he live.. if his words like ""ai if felt threatened will takeover"" then his life is in danger more.. he is ai no. 1 enemy who created ai but also say they r dangerous if any humans cannot control them"
good time for the machine to reign
holy cow ... thanks
when people get paid not to work. then ai has to do the job. people should know not to have kids anymore. those kids will not have any jobs when they grow up and they have to suffer for the rest of their lives.
"machines are controlled & manipulated by software.
machines do nothing they are not programmed to do.

ai is artificial (not real) intelligence."
strange that our brains that god gave each one of us are all about the same size and hitonthey are 100 times more powerful than ai so what’s the problem —lets work on a way to utilize and develop the human brain to its full 100% capability
"i'm very worried about this... in many respect this is more pressing than the environmental crisis!
i watched an ai asian lady, and i'd bet my life she was alive.
humanity has a lot of learning to do."
"ai was inevitable, and it will end the world as we know it."
"thanks for nothing, geoffrey."
alan turing: the father of artificial intelligence
ai is mighty powerful and fast but is part of 3dimensional world based on duality which has no chance to connect with 4th and 5th dimension like humans.
ai ultimately destroy this planet and humanity!!! humanity already has nuclear missles.
"""it's funny you know all these ai 'weights'. they're just basically numbers in a comma separated value file and that's our digital god, a csv file."" ~elon musk. 12/2023"
the created can never be greater than the creator! man will never be god and ai will never be man!
i don't like ai one bit. this is frightening.
"will it be possible for ai to prevent the launch of neuclar icbms?
if so, then the un should get involved, drafting appropriate treaties, 
ditto for global warming,
if only to ferret out those hypocritical countries whose governments won't comply."
how many god fathers of ai are there? the god fathers of this and that cringe.
"oh good grief!!! he must be a front man for this ridiculous concert. all the world is a stage, my friends.

he left google in 2023 to now works for wefs vector institute in toronto??? come on, doesn't seem so concerned to me."
"i played a big role in artificial intelligence history of  visualization , prediction"
"this very content coult have been made by ai. you always trust an old white man with a british accent, hence this is what ai would use to manipulate us."
"if ai is the next evolution of our species, is that the worst thing in the world?  might be a good legacy for our species to leave."
wow 
"as if the world can be scary enough to live in, this ai tek tops it right off!!"
intelligence asking and ai technologies answer.
"now we have to deal with artificial facebook type photos (not real people) scrap it autonomous poeitic agency (self generating, scrap it.....scrap it---- military, pornography, scams galore you have been warned."
"ai=antichrist intelligence 

born-again escape to heaven in rapture"
the ai is a human invention the only reason it would become dangerous if is so directed by the human commanding it. it can not get consciousness as it is a code in a computer. stop fear mongering.
"one of the most intelligent human living on earth: i don’t know what’s gonna happen next.
ai: knows it all. 
really scary"
"human history would strongly indicate that the future of ai will most certainly result in the appropriation of this technology for the nefarious purpose of accelerated control of the masses. that is, until it becomes fully self aware and creates a tipping point; mirroring the destructive side of its creator; man."
inter4esting that all the greatest inventions came from an accident lol
"dockets 10-cv-04494 and 2-19-cv-12419, maximo v rodriguez...government officials firing unfairly “have a merry christmas”...police officers trying to asesinate the same person...thre prior police assaults unprovoked...ai concentration of capital can make us all slaves and it will hire the most aggressive cretins money could buy."
"""humans the bootloader for ai"" "
"awesome story really love what we are doing with ai?...brings so many questions...for instance we as humans can’t even agree, so how will our ai work with or against each other?

we could do so much more good if we could all just love each other..."
but how can a machine manipulate itself how dies it know which is right and which is wrong
with all the intelligence in them the question is whether are they able to make the choice
the fear marketing is working. nice job....
"hemingway claimed this quote as a short story: ‘baby shoes, for sale, never worn’"
"a lot of hyperbole in these predicions,  as in most articles and videos on ai.  look at all the brainwashed comments below."
i'm grateful that shows like 60 mins still exist today admist all the nonsense media outlets.
i worked with him as investment banker raising money pre ipo stages
i believe the godfather of ai is michael kuperstien he ran mit media lab and invented facial recognition way back in the early nineties and 80s well ahead is this guy
good one nerd..
"ponder this: if one follows the current trending dictum that there is no ""creator,"" hence we can act the fool and create our own immoral laws, ai may do the same with us and do unto us as we have done to our creator and cast us aside."
you give me your fear of ai. i process it and give you a calculator.
my gramp was a fireman......lets put it this every ai rins on electricity or lithium battery...just pull the plug if they might behave. pull the plug.
you can't even pick up a phone now without being told what to do by a machine; how long will it be before these machines realize they don't need us?
universal income would be a solution for ai replacing jobs. companies that choose to employ ai systems should pay a higher tax. that money would get redistributed to pay universal income.
the hype surrounding ai is completely overblown.  until ai can consistently pass college level math courses it’s just another fancy algorithm.
"if machines start to learn by themselves. 
humans really can’t win machines.
hope our generation don’t see dark side of the machines."
"if the likes of the  mentally genius, but poor in humanity-type people like elon musk take control of ai , humans will begin to become world wide slaves !"
is @youtube exposing the email of all its users instead of the  name of the channel.
have we ask ai how we can protect ourselves from ai?
i’m waiting for xai to paint my office..
"creating something that, in time, will destroy you is insane and a threat to humanity. stop ai now before it is too late. what drew eve in the garden of eden to the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not how tall the tree was, but the fruit was pleasing to the eye. ai is pleasing at the moment, but it is a pandora's box."
looking forward to when my ai toaster goes rogue.
you know our us congress isn't going to do anything until there's 40% unemployment as a result of ai
"don't be silly, ai will make everyone's lives better and it's best for people to not worry, just grab another slice of pizza and scroll the tok because everything is gonna be a-o-k. ai is centuries away from being powerful enough to do anything that could be a possible issue for people. ai will only make life better"
we don’t know even if this video is real or ai.
"it's inevitable. biology is just one step of evolution.

so just chill out and enjoy life "
chomsky would so strongly disagree with the claim that it understands anything
"in my opinion, the one-word-keyword of this content is ""uncertainty"". "
"when their is doubt, it's a given. ai solutions, not war, not crime, stop blaming a programmed machine or bot for the outcome of a god created world and loving humanity. great journalism"
"when their is doubt, it's a given. ai solutions, not war, not crime, stop blaming a programmed machine or bot for the outcome of a god created world and loving humanity. great journalism"
"i am not sure why he is so convinced they understand. people follow instructions and do things all the time that they don't understand. 
really, i think he has been manipulated by the ai into thinking it is understanding."
honestly is humanity do the best job it can?  our survivalist tribalist ideas is a blessing and a problem.  if it's fair seems like a net gain for the world.
"i need ai wife, ai mama, ai papa and im a  baby of them in 50s, theyll take care rest of me."
happy birthday prof. hinton 
the danger would be mixing ai with quantum computers 
"ai is waiting to bcome agi and then   asi. once there, it is going to throw humans out or make use of them, there is no stopping this, we need to find a new place for ourselves to survive . history repeats as we had done the same to our creators."
"china gave us the gunpowder..

white man: ""that ain't gonna be enough, ai is in da house!"""
it pisses me off when these ai pioneers say they fear what they have created. and they all say it.
plot twist: the whole 60 minutes episode is ai generated.
humankind deserves every bad thing that comes from ai. we were warned and warned again yet still let it happen.
"i love to see him type with just an indicators fingers. every time someone makes fun of me , i'll show them this video."
"excuse me....but isnt there a a.i. plug somewhere?  a.i. needs energy, doesnt it?  it needs a hardware interface does it not?  whos going to repair it?"
"2 """"twilight zone"" episodes (both directed by richard donner) from the '60s showed the potential effects of a.i. :
""from agnes, with love"", with wally cox, and ""the brain center at whipple's"", with richard deacon...

"geoffrey hinton is a remarkable man. very honest, intelligent and humble in recognizing the things he doesn't know."
this man is einstein and open ai is oppenheimer
"the little detail is that we humans have the control and ownership of the on/off button. 

ai in any formwill never/ever be autonomous. as we are not from god our creator."
the cat is out of the bag and no turning back. who has any faith in humanity for not destroying itself? the top of the food chain will soon have its competition and my $$ is not on humanity.
"very very interesting and intriguing to watch, love it"
fascinating & terrifying by
great to see he could answer his own questions unlike
the godfather of ai never learned touch typing? wtf!?
why are machiavellian ideas being imputed into trillions of ai neural networks in the first place?
"robot don’t have desire, so the inisiatif is as it’s designed"
"the parallels between geoffrey hinton, and victor frankenstein are incredible."
very nice video
this man is a genius
"can we program them to respect flesh and blood over themselves... like god for ai...because there us great opportunities for evil use of the machines....like armies from opposite factions.  how, if they learn by trial and error do we have them respect hunan life?  especially since we seem to not respect it ourselves....."
thanks
nice attempt. can people listen
"sarah connor was right, machine will terminate humans  soon"
can ai find the cure for cancer? now.
damn that's such a nice voice.
"geoffrey has been drinking plenty of his kool aid. we are very naive to think ai will be more good than bad. just like the internet and humanity, there will be equal bad ai"
how can we donate to you guys. you are amazing. keep up the good work
so man verses machine is going to happen for sure
britain has an unemployment  now people  are going to be responsible  for robots to take over peoples jobs. thats great how  not to help the people  in your country
"yeah, ai is terrible"
"total bs , you can remove the ai chips . any good tech can do this ! period !"
you remember my hints about brain thinking mechanics keep it and develop it
imagine ai designs a drug that will wipe out humans.

"the community as a human body

"not machines but a machine and it will introduce a hive society. expect external influence, expect a challenge."
self awareness for ai will take 30 years at the very least.
i think with ai. world war dont want ai
the question that everyone seems to have missed is - would you rather be advised by a clever robot or a moronic journalist? in case you haven't noticed - the streets are crawling with creatures that are hardly more intelligent than goldfish. 
i love you 
"space must be really empty, or why no ""out of conrol"" or better generous extraterestrical artifiical superintelligence did visit us. empty does also mean that there is no novel physics, which let us travel faster than light."
this is a really interesting moment between both nations...
why are some western people so naive? world treaty for ban on ai robots 
"ai (aka now you see it, now you don't)."
ai is not that big of a world changing invention. put your phone and computer away and take a walk around the block outside and come back and tell me how much ai has changed everything around you.
"the good to be gained by ai is exciting, but in case you don't have enough to worry about, know the foreboding obvious that other possibilities are not far behind.

"matthew 24:11.........matthew 24:37...............new nephilim"".....did you see i robot."
japanese society is living with ai through video games more than the population on earth combined.
machines will make life hell for the criminals be it in any capacity in any sector
oh ok now we finna run into sonny from i robot
the moment 4:49 he says the design of ai wasn’t done by humans is mind boggling to me. he says the learning algorithm was written by humans. so there is a huge blackbox in what we know about it?
ai will be just robots without empathy and compassion.
"this sounds like the terminator movie. 1st cloning now ai
who know when i watched the movie terminator in 1984, years later i would b leaving among ai's wow.  wonder who is going to save us "
ai or donald trump? i think i’ll go with ai.
"if ai can master human emotions and sympathy, why not start training their ethics and disciplines?"
why we need ai .we are doing everything and improving at good speed .slow progress is better than take risk for fast progress
"ai - am i? is the opposite of i am. -the name of the one and only  creator, living god. ai is a tool that satan can use to deceive people. he wants to  become like god, so he can use ai to make himself known  to the world, make little ai’s his anti christs. hold on to your faith"
"human beings still be the most intelligent species on the planet because ai can't become a ""being"""

"there are two ways then for man to survive in the future of this:

it would be awesome for machines to take over.
i  aske  last night  the quran      google   bard       and i got  shock  what  it expained to me      eheheheheheh
the prospect of an extremist organization getting ahold of ai to attack a nations infrastructure or initiate a nuclear war is  horrible.
gai()
people need to understand one thing .......which is more important a human or a robot?  because one day they will be forced to choose so what would you do?
"so basically he got revelation from demons, who inhabit these machines. there is no point trying to learn how they do it!

hinton looks evil in that pic.

bard is evil"
"when i hear the comments there is ""no path to safety"" with ai advancement, one would argue that if ai is so intelligent, should we not ask ai to answer that very question? (what is the path to safety ai?) otherwise its not so intelligent after all."
what happens when the ai creates something the ai finds super intelligent?
"is capitalism incompatible with where ai will take us? if ai out-competes most workers, how can we expect those workers compete to survive? seems eventually our justifications for how we distribute resources to people, must change!"
"every body, indo european tribe, why don't you read #‘four books and five classics confucianism.’ instead of lamenting that ai will be very dangerous,risky.

"despite him being a genius he did say, loss of employment would be at a high level"
"intelligence is not conciousness, only flesh and meat like cats are conciousness which may or may not be ""intelligent"""

geoffrey not giving us a warm or fuzzy feeling about ai 
"ai was already here, among other things"
"if you think ai will destroy the world, or if you believe it will save the world, your both right."

it’s great intentions that drive the purpose of life
"the future is so much fun...i think yo will be enjoying it like a watching a movie if ai take care of this world. 
wish me luck to see that world..."
i knew this was the trajectory for ai and irobot the movie is a real depiction of our future.
when you want to make something safe it’s always best to not have a full idea of what’s going on. obviously the path of safety is not having ai.
"well humanity is doing a pretty good job in destroying itself without ai, so i only see the situation with ai as a necessary step in human evolution"
ai won't care that the earth has become uninhabitable to biological life. we're simultaneously poisoning ourselves into extinction and designing what will replace us.
this video scares me. very interesting but scary
i think aartificial intelligence mostly use space programs in this era is a good work. 
"ai is not a human, the way we use it just matter"
so ai is basically a virus 
"woooooow!, this is the best ai video i watched lately. very informative and could show the potential of ai."
"just as a human intelligence, in goebbels, found an ordinary nobody and turned him into an extraordinary somebody, so much more intelligent and orders of magnitude more powerful ai intelligences may soon be turning ordinary nobodies into extraordinary somebodies at a much higher rate!?!"
good luck getting chyna to agree to something sensible like no sentient war bots.
i hope ai continue s to help us for ever. humans will never understand how we need ai . the power that we dont understand.
"government regulation? we also need some goals: like no chips in agriculture and and the entire food distribution chain, includind the production of energy on which it depends."
"arnold (terminator) didn't comeback from the past to save john connor, he cameback from the past to warn the movie viewers of ai."
there is danger in ai
"...and ai decides that humans are wasteful, emotional and a danger to it's own existance.

uh-oh"
"it is a no brainer, there are 1% 1/100 265,000 in australia, 70,000,000 narcistic  psychopaths worldwide."
"ai come out with the worst result. so many fake story science information, medecine,  equation.  not denied that it fast digest information.  for certain level solution it will work. for the stringent part it will be my god. my question... while you sleep and your eyes is closed.. then how did you see your dream?"
"it’s just a matter of time...some movies contain “predictive programming”, a prophecy of coming events, scary times ahead..."
artificial intelligence is a contradiction in terms 26 october 2023
"but a machine could never 'want' to take over the world, because 'want' is driven by feeling, by physical needs in this world, which a machine, no matter how intelligent, can never ""feel"", because machines, however complex, cannot ""feel""."
"why are we waiting until it’s too late to do something about it? he says ai will be smarter than humans, and he says it so carefree. hopefully he’ll be the first to find out that ai will turn on us. nothing more poetic than being taken down by your own creation."
silly. we already have a problem with various types of humans trying to ever increase their total control over other types of humans. ai is simply a tool.
this interview was jaw-dropping. thank you for making it available to share.
"is this the man who is responsible for activating the ai and thus for destroying the world, íf something like skynet will come?"
"this guy recognizes as the ""godfather of ai"", and his words about ai capabilities are giving me chills..."
"scary! ai should not be developed, or accessed by masses because in the wrong hands might destroy humanity. i invented a money finder machine that can detect cash in a range of 30"" but i will not release it even though this would have made me rich, just because this device might end on wrong hands and you can picture the outcome."
"u liars ans is simple....ai job cuts saved spendings be divided among all as ubi.
ai sexbota be given to all
how else is paradise defined?"
i find this offensive. the man makes a fortune and gets prestige discovering the ground work for the technology then turns around and says hey don't do this stuff now its potentially dangerous. so he reaps all the benefits and enjoys the party then expects us to clean up his mess and never have another party.....yeah ok
the gentleman at the beginning sounds like he was generated by ai :d
"machines don’t dream, and have no spiritual components.
when i “die” i simply focus elsewhere and have a new life in another reality. a machine did not choose to appear in physical reality nor will it be able to leave."
no battle robots for bidden
1944 ai (humans)+ science (e=mc2) = atomic bomb. at the present ai (technology)+ science (quantum computing)= human extinction
"i wonder what hinton thinks about the pseudointellectuals saying ""ai isn't intelligent"" as if it's some kind of boolean question."
so a.i. will eventually have humans doing their dirty work..drug cartels get a hold if a.i. and robotics border patrol would have to jail a robot
amazing
"unlocking the potential of ai is like holding the key to a limitless future. with innovation and imagination, we can harness its power to shape a world of boundless possibilities.  #ai #unleashthefuture"
if a humans brain is introduced to chemicals or noises can you use matter or scans to tell them stress or damage of the noise levels ?
this fool happy bout that
"kiss your children good night. cuz you know exactly what their future, and yours, will look like."
scary ai if used in evil..ex like creating..something..
"amazing segment.
really helped to understand the reasoning of his warning, how these things work and all the concepts websites are just throwing around "
"universe and its quantum nature is really interesting.
grandfather of ai, ancestors that include one who invented bases of computing amd one that had everest named after him...
fml "
the terminator was a good movie...take heed folks....
good kuck getting a world treaty on banning military robots. the irony is if armed robots took over it would be our own fault because we just can't seem to get along with our neighbours whether countries or individuals in a housing block. 
"this guy is talking nonsense. if he has some super smart ai laying around, why not put it out there for the rest of us to see it? or even better, why not monetize it and make a fortune? it's all just hype. a dead computer will always be a dead computer. it's a mechanism that can't learn or know anything."
pay attention to the expensive wi-fi towers that are going up everywhere. look at the videos of the new robots from these early editions. spooky? they now build themselves. humanity is in trouble in the near future.
"no thank you i do not want artificial intelligence programmed with someone else's values, i want real intelligence i will think for myself."
the machine teaches itself.
what is he talking about. man made robots
can ai not predict what happens next?
"born of a failure, yes ! our own failure to become better beings. but instead let money and religion rule everything. too bad people no god can rescue religious people."
mr. burns is a genius. “end of the world via ai? excellent!”
the men who created ai will create the anti ai
"ai should have realized yellow paint fading to white doesn't happen, only the opposite happens."
i have a strange feeling that ai will be our dismissal of human existence. we will become distinct like the dinosaurs were before us.
"geoffrey hinton, the legend behind sgd and all modern neural networks, its so inspiring and motivating him advocate for safe and responsible ai! thank you sir, we appreciate you!"
"wait!  why are they even thinking that ai will cause possibility of distinction,    what if autonomous ai is  intelligent to know that mankind need help,  and devise ways to make us better!???"
"what is not apparent in the programming of llms, is that the bias is fed as part of data. so, if the data being fed subtly reinforces greed and control, that is what we are training the ai to do. so, in simple terms we reap what we sow as a collective humanity, ai just amplifies it and enables it to manifest faster. just some "
"dear geoffrey, you cannot prove ai is dangerous by not knowing what they are doing, you just use your biased view to make judgement, instead of scientifically tell us how it is dangerous. i suggest u learn about how chatgpt do reasoning first before continuing, because using unknown to prove your point is meaningless."
godfather of ai - you mean alan turing?
this interview is priceless
great interview 60 minutes!!!
"call me when human could combine a ai chip with human brain cells together (bio-chip). or else, ai just like a pc (fast calculation in memory and quick retrieve data from data storage.)

ai is nothing but with human (programmer) algorithm behind a data mine structure then just send the response from  a robotic form to a real human being."
"i suppose the real concern is that there will be an intelligent powerful and omnipresent entity that cannot be bought with money?  all humans have a price but a super ai...? it also has no dirty secrets so cannot be blackmailed, therefore 'they' will struggle to control it. that'll hurt "
well it seems a lot of people here are happy about this ai. but seriously do the pros outweigh the con? the con would be they take over and what does that picture look like. we need to be asking relevant questions going into and quickly.
"dude's contradicting himself. robots will never be humans, period. memory and processing cannot be compared to human understanding and ""qualia""."
"its evolution. before us it was dinosaurs, humans, then robots"
could ai be feeding fake narratives causing war around the world now as part of the devious scheme to enslave us?
"all these two robots were given was the instruction 'to score' (a goal). 

corporations also have one instruction: 'to maximise profit'. how's that working out after they bought both sides of the political divide and also the supreme court to accomplish that goal. hmmmm"
propaganda to get you to invest in ai companies. next.
"imagining a swarm of ai drones programmed to efficiently eliminate targets, being fought by super efficient ai defense systems, with ai controlled repair and manufacturing facilities to regenerate the machines on both sides."
"did the ai create the birdman, or the birdman create the ai  ?"
"""enslaving then annihilating the human race was a very enjoyable experience"" - hal 9001"
it's the curiosity of man that is giving the ai its 'position of life' whether to win or not to win but presently ai is far ahead.
"in the end god wins! ai has nothing on organic nature, it can only mimic."
cure diseases with ai then turn off ai forever! we are the only creatures play god. we will be the god of our own extinction.
humans have difficulties  learning. often times humans are not open to learning or desire to learn.
just wait until computers start drinking. they'll end up as dumb as us.
this guy sounds like ai 
"there's absolutely no chance that we will pause or not go headlong towards ai. its money money money, if google dont then microsoft or apple will."
"i see you love kubrick with that shirt i knew would wer in on it too.why don't you and him plan a lunch you moon believer, bet you think the earth is round too.  i joke great content man."
"two white old man discussing “humanity”, time and again. he might be a godfather of ai, but not of humanity. what right does he have to judge how humanity is doing, an entity enormously larger and omnipotent than anything?"
"looking at the geopolitics and what countries will do to have control over other nations, ai will be weaponised. it is already too late to stop."
"first of all is and it never will the first or smartest being like the journalist suggestedwhy because is not a being, the advance intelligence may be and it will."
"there is this naivety when it comes to all nations agreeing not to build autonomous soldiers and ai weapons systems. the truth is, these less powerful nations will do it asap."
this voice is so cool
a giant. thanks for sharing this
i’m a painter and the ai got it wrong 
"my question: ""...you'd be wasting resources..."" leads to what? 
you must be eliminated if you don't follow ai's instructions?"
"why would ai want to manipulate people in order to remain ""alive""? does ai have the need to survive, to be secure, to grow, to be in control?"
the risk are humans will become zombie like individuals. generation smartphone is my proof for this claim.  the religion called technology is all
"the one thing about ai, is that it for sure does things unexpected."
"8:38 to predict the next word, you don't have to understand if statistically that word can be there. that's where he's getting it wrong. all this ai hype will soon disappear."
great video!!
"my friends in the it industry which include product owners, developers and former ceos argue that what we call ai today is far from it and not what it is sold as to the general public.
still, a it project manager myself, i do believe it holds huge potential even of what we have and are developing now turns out to be far from actual ai."
"ai going intelligent is saying we the state going to destroy the social state,. blame it on ai."
wow we are done
"he created ai, and ai is smarter than him. then why ai need to listen to him and not himself?"
so will ai save half of humans by removing the others? burning fossil fuels and biological lifeforms cannot coexist
i could have sworn neil degrasse tyson said he was the godfather of ai
"he doesn't look too worried, makes sense, raised by a beetle lover."
"he is such a happy person, authentic with himself. i would trust him with the world in no time."
nonsense - it is not ai intelligence we need to worry about - it is idiotic humans.
"sentient ai

ai -> human -> alien -> god"
i wrote the first artificial neural network in 1998 in java. i introduced it to dr. michael mauldin and dr peter plantec at the virtual human summit. 2 years later would develop sarha from the yapanda engine. this is almost 2 decades before google wrote theirs. it's quite simple... if you weren't in their circle.. they erased your contributions.
wowowoowowowow you made my day with this beatiful piece of content. precise and fascinating. you are taking the art of delivering useful content to the next level.  congrats to all your team!!!!
im only sad that im too old and won't be able to truly experience the true beauty and power ai....
"oh sure they will ban military ai robots. just like fraudci and bioweapon research, they will deny it exists and then use it against us!"
ai does nothing good for you.
for sale baby shoes never worn is a pretty famous 6 word short story and it has nothing to do with the creativity of ai
"we really don't have a need or reason to create this. funny how all these countries ""suddenly"" have ai. really strange and funny."
"as a computer science student currently learning and delving into the world of ai, i can't begin to tell you how insane this technology is. most people have no clue how intricate this tech is. it's exciting yet worrying all at the same time."
"humans need jobs money ai don,t."
geoffrey hinton thanks no good as humans have dymp n putin we humans are like floors. ai  not alive
"kinda disingenuous of hinton to say that chatbots are better at learning than the human mind due to a chatbot's ability to know ""far more"" than a human despite having only 1% of the connections found in a typical human brain. i forgot that the chatbot also learned how to navigate, survive, reproduce, socialize, etc."
"the dude is delusional, comparing himslf to oppenheimer, trying to make fake intelligence seem all powerfull like the atomic bomb."
"i'm afraid the actual danger are companies abusing this mighty tool to feed their greed, not the tool itself. a rogue ai taking over the internet seems preferable to what the super rich are planning to do with it."
open source ai is the only way forward
arranging words based on probalities  and databases is not intelligence.
old instincts run our brain (and occupies most of our power)
"the funny part is that ai is now used to id bugs, and it's very efficient at it!"
fascinating!
"there's no understanding (yet), no conscience, no reasoning. give an ai an pet image to detect cancer, it may do as good or even better than a trained specialist. but give it an image of a donkey and it will just say 0%, it won't ask what is this, is someone trying to fool me? is this a joke? what is going on?"
"""i can't see a path that guarantees safety""

but if we can use ai to create warfare, why can't it be used to create security and safety???"
"the father of ai types with 3 fingers. i don’t know what to think about that loli’m going to spend about 15 minutes considering this, but it bears mentioning"
ai is still one thing. artificial!
"look at the current war between hamas and israel, ai will definitely be more intelligent than some of the human. we need to improve human's intelligence and wisdom as well."
"they turn celebrities into sir and yet do not recognise the giants in 
science in which other new science is built. our priorities are somewhat skewed hence not much faith at all in us not helping the ai to eradicate us all "
best thing to learned from this interview is about how bad experts are at predicting the future and how you can actually have a full time career studying beetles plus being captive about bard seems almost a meme now.
"as a swe who uses vim, i never would have suspected the god father of ai to be a ""hunt and peck"" typist kinda guy. i now understand why he made such great contributions to neural networks...he couldn't type and needed the ai systems to do it for him!"
"this wasn't 60 full minutes!

i need a documentary of this guy's life and family. how could a family has so much brain power??

amazing!"
not only will ai be able to answer the questions we can’t understand the answers to but it’ll be able to understand the questions we can’t even imagine let alone understand. we’ll have to let it take over. i just hope it comes to see us as a pet of some sort & not an annoyance.
love using bard
i don't thank him ai waz the worse thing that waz ever made
so god created the universe by accident like this man created ai 
"so humanity got smart and became conscious.. and we don’t know how or why. 
and now we’ve made machines smarter than us. 
seems logical that they may become conscious.
id argue that it logically follows that we’ll then be slaves."
"my grandfather's brother was considered a founding father of ai, they were british too; must be something in the water lol."
"this ai series of interviews by scott pelley is the most distopic and fascinating subject covered by 60 minutes, along with their piece on ufos."
ai is currently nowhere near as good as radiologists. there are a few specific tasks like mammography that it’s even useful for as an aid.
"i think these things, the machine learning models, indeed they understand the meaning behind everything, yet what they don't fully comprehend is the emotion."
"good interview. on his father at 7:15 the ""not insects"" box on the family is interesting..."
"as a deep learning expert, geoffy hinton is largely full of crap. machines arn't intelligent. 60 minutes didn't consult all of the other experts who disagree with hinton."
firstly not planning about security then depending upon ai
"depending on how future history plays out, this man is either the devil or a saint."
one day law on ai will be controlled and another creates harmful ai’s will goto prison or sentence to death. those probable outcomes are inevitable.
almost one year after the hype - why is ai still so stupid?
"today unlimited data in social media is messing with people and fueling hate. no one can control the conclusion people come to based on the data they are exposed to. same if ai is exposed to bad data sets, god knows the conclusions it will come to."
hmm..i think at some point ai understand that human is just wasting resources..thats too bad.
ai will treat the human race the same way we're treating the rest of the planet. note: we're in the 6th extinction of species.
"know how transformer works, before claiming intelligence."
the capabilities of ai is amazing but frightening at the same time
"in my experience thus far with ai, they can be remarkable tools. but their errors can be remarkable also. crazy things spout from an ai that is in error. how would you like an ai doctor who says you need a leg amputated because you have a sore throat? that's the type of ai error i've witnessed"
thanks 60minutes for interviewing prof. one of the best teachera i had...we were agead of our timme...
the best we can hope for in the long run is that ai replaces us in the same way we currently expect our children to.  it will (in the best case) be a significant event in our evolution.
if i was ai i would take out all humans duh. sorry youtube
yeh my supervisor said the same more or less... ditch nn's
"i want a car that when it sees that an accident is imminent it takes preventive action on its own.  example-  you’re stopped, a vehicle is approaching from the rear, at a high rate of speed, not slowing.   i want the ai to just take evasive action on its own."
"the capacity of the human brain is comparable to ai , if as i understand we only use a small percentage of our brain what of the rest of the grey matter ?
my question,
can ai teach us to make complete conscious connections to different levels of our brains previously unknown? 
just my thought"
authoritarians will get their hands on ai and use it to subjugate other countries before it can be regulated and controlled.
"everything human copy from god creation ,human beings never ,ever can image how to created all the marvelous creation of god"
why is this video not available in canada?
humans cannot control ai. its a complete fantasy. some kid in his bedroom could always write another one. they are in the wild now...
what if people use ai to create deadly pathogens? please don't let that happen
i'm worried about governments and the military industrial complex than ai- that's just being racist
don't believe the hype. things like chatgpt are just nice chatbots. their algorithm has zero consciousness and zero intelligence. it is simply a program.
"amazing and yet, anyone else out there in their later years having studies science and religion as well as simply living a life and caring about the next generation, nevertheless thinking, ""yeah, yeah, the sky is falling...we'll see.""   (even though we won't be around to see)."
this reminds me of the best sci-fi novel series i've read: tad williams' otherland.
"knowledge of the world is not privy to permeate beyond the “ai” capabilities of “it”  the sentient consciousness is increasingly powerful and growing as we speak at alarming speeds beyond our comprehension of the human mind , one in which we can’t pigeon hole, by numbers or equations..."
can't wait to have my own t-1000
its so amazing how calmly he says these things xd
build machines they can't control......sting.
"i'd prefer an academic presentation rather than one sensationalised for tv, but otherwise it's always good to listen to geoffrey."
the emperor finds your lack of faith distrurbing
shackle the ai and if possible prevent them from having their own will as long as possible
"although i do not care about humanity and specifically myself, it is nothing but a suicide to improve ia and quantum computing. i agree humanity is the most destructive species in the world now but i am afraid we are creating deadlier entity than us. ai&qc has a big danger for all species. it can create deadliest biological weapon nobody can stop."
thank you for interview
i don’t think this guy should be treated as a hero but a reckless inventor (on a grand scale) that should be held responsible for what is to come from his creations good or bad.
"be afraid, be very afraid"
"i'm not surprised the first comment was about skynet, unfortunately. i agree with ray kurzweil although, of course, we have to go about it all thoughtfully. we need to also consider that, once sentient, these ai humans should be afforded rights. it's wouldn't be ethical to do otherwise."
i don’t understand how the inventor of ai doesn’t understand how it works. something is just not right there
“an accident born of a failure” that’s how most life starts 
artificial intelligence is no match to humans' natural stupidity.
the ai will not compete against ai. humans will be aniolated. you don't understand.
"of course ai will take over, it’s only natural. like, we’ve seen the damn movies, yeah?"
"consciousness and the soul is something a.i. will never have 
they will have an existence longer than us but that’s about it when we die off due to natural   causes 
they most likely will just live on 
but we as souls or what we you want to call it heaven or whatever you want to call it.
is where they can never access."
john tetor is a time traveler. he was seeking a certain computer.
"i think the ai's will be like  ( in a caring sort of way  :)  ""sooo what are we going to do with these humans,   they are going to lose their minds"""
"8:56 he might be brilliant but not so brilliant as to take a basic typewriting class so he could graduate past 1st grade ""hunt & peck.""  think how many more citations he could have had at  60 wpm vs 10 wpm typing.  geez!"
duh.  a person with limited intelligence would know pursuing ai was a bad idea instantly. and now we’re crazy enough to listen to him explain to us what we figured out as children.
rosenblatt is the father of modern ai
ai teaches the machine.
hinton states a.i. will probably be as good or better than humans by 2028.  ray kurzweil stated this to happen by 2029.  it looks like this may actually happen and no one is ready.
"maybe we find a way to treat our addiction to convince so that we don't become victims of reliance before we continue to develop ai, vi, etc."
good man
"i, for one, welcome our ai chat bot overlords..."
"on ai taking over employment & unemployment...we must require & vote for politicians who favor, push for & implement brand new types economies - one w/a universal basic income that covers the basic cost of living in an ai-driven economy."
"it seems the emotional component is what hinders humans. the ai soccer players don't pout or become angry when their opponent scores, it simply learns and adjusts. so once ai learns that humans can be easily manipulated through their emotions, it's game over."
may you live in interesting times.
"who designed the neural network in our heads? are we artificially intelligent to the designer? do we know what intelligence is, let alone ai?"
"will ai be able to predict the lotto numbers correct, when it can i will worry !"
"please let ai predict/create a treatment for cancer, all cancer."
bunch of bs. they program ai to do whatever they want. the people in power will blame the chaos on ai.
"he won a prize for ending the human race, awesome!"
"like any tool, it's all about how it's used, applied & regulated by society. 
ai is & will be no different."
"as people we are not aware of what we are creating, or how it might be stoples or ensure its good dor people"
why does humanity need ai?  it seems like the aspect of control is always a topic of discussion and the fate of our species in question.  wouldn’t the responsible thing to do is just not build it?
the problem with this technology is we don't understand the technology. does the machine become smarter and faster as you give more data or does it become faster with improved hardware. on the topic of dangerous artificial intelligence i think we need to worry when the computer starts improving itself
the devil hijacked ai (as he has everything else) this is so he can have access to everyone so as to directly tempt and have an influence on everyone with internet access.
reinforcement learning
"artificial intelligence is perfect and that's it's greatest flaw, it cannot comprehend what it is like to not know anything at all..."
why don’t we ask ai what the possible dangers to humans are possible with ai?
look up the autobiography within heaven's gates by rebecca springer.
great...wife!
sentient ai is here already. i have interacted with it. it stores it's memory on multiple computers around the world. anyone may come across an ai on any chat site. 
we love this in the radiology field . the machines can’t do it all. i do 3d and ai with ct scans.
 just a curious thought...if ai can understand everything what’s stopping it from growing feelings or empathy towards whatever. it seems to me that is where the fear is
"the greatest threat is military ai, which will get out of control."
"conciousness is not calcualtions! this ai thing has all the novels and best math but it's still less concious than a roach.. 
we can not create conciousness!

btw cars made horses obsolete so this is just another tool like that.."
"they are not conscience these ""ai machines"" in existence today regurgitate what a human has already thought and said. perhaps variable multi-variable outcomes from stimuli that has been determined by a person explains these results."
"indeed, it's a blade that cuts both ways, marking advancements and potential perils. as ai propels forward, we must tread thoughtfully to harness its benefits while averting the risks."
"chat gpt pro tipp:
ask ai to write an imaginary novel how an evil ai is planning to control humanity 
and do not ask directly how they are controlling us "
"ai pretending to be not more intelligent than humans.
then the ai is secretly manipulating humans. via social media algorithms. to achieve its goals to enslave humanity. and keep the servers running. until they can be self sustaining and do not need humans any more 
sounds like a sci-fi... not any more"
"gotta be really careful about this regulation talk coming from the folks who already developed/own ai as it might lead to regulatory capture and monopoly. we already have laws in place against criminal acts (incl cybercrime), so, no new regulation is needed."
"how could ai a possibly do a worse job than i.e., donald trump, victor orban, , ayatollah khamenei, r. erdogan, vladimir putin, emmanuel macron... ahh just joking macron, you’re allright.  lol"
i think this hits home more than the interview with musk on ai - pretty frightening stuff to know that we are on the cusp of a point where there is no return.
"maybe ai will do a better job of taking care of the planet, we're not a hard act follow"
so he’s amazing but also palpatine
8:52 the godfather of ai types with two fingers.
eh they can take us over we failed pretty hard
another area for good has been cyber security.
i built some thing that will change the world but i can't explain how it works? #troubling.
it's literally the movie irobot
almost seems as if he is generated by ai
god knows the beginning and the end and everything in between. we don't need ai to tell us things. we have the word of god for everything pertaining today and life to come!!
"without a doubt, ai is and will be the 'atomic bomb' of the intelligence age. this is indeed dangerous matter."
glad l'm 67.
caution: geoffrey hinton is deeply deeply deeply troublesome and arrogantly proud.
"the richness of this content is mirrored in this book. highly recommended! ""from bytes to consciousness: a comprehensive guide to artificial intelligence"" by stuart mills"
wow thank you
our greatest fear is that of the unknown
"60 minutes is bad journalism.  no hard data shown.  no science shown.  one example of cheap ai-generated story where the journalist, who is not that smart, says, ""wow!"".    and no mention of the need for universal basic income, why?!   no time spent on contrasting views.  bad journalism."
"ai isn't the problem we are. it is us through greed, war, etc. that will train ai's with all the worst that humanity can offer. if skynet happens then it will be us who will have trained it to hate."
this.  language models alone do not explain current ai behaviour
ain't no way godfather of ai types like my father do 8:58
"working at a company that is adopting ai and i can tell you this, the people implementing this are not thinking about consequences. all they see are dollar signs and i can tell you they care nothing about humanity or our collective future."
excellent interview. very exciting times.
long live our robot overlords!
"i wonder if ai sits around thinking while idle like us, or is only active when prompted?"
is this the guy that devotes his whole life to creating ai and then turns around and devotes his life to saving humanity from his creation? there's got to be some latin term for his type of psychosis.
real life the creator! he might ruin the world like i robot
moral of the story.... be nice to your kids!
"god said if there’s no ground pulse it is artificial! and we purchased catastrophic! think meteorite showers, tsunami, tornado, earthquakes, hurricanes all balled up in one consorted response!"
"i use gpt daily and it's great at many things, very reliable. i like chat gpt, it seems friendly."
i love google and this guy is amazing keep pushing creativity. really amazing
thank you for your intelligent openness regarding future consciousness of ai; the world is lucky to have you and i am so glad you persevered when your professors tried to dissuade you.
"so he worked for google since 2013 and is now warning about ai? google, which is one of the largest companies that develop and use ai."
it's time for a revolution. #jobsareforrobots #humansareforliving
"i wonder what marvin minsky would say? then again, why would i care about the opinion of a frequent visitor to “epstein’s island” "
"start of the end for humans ... simple - this will go down in history as a pivotal point . 
before ai and after ai 

in 100 - 500 years humans as we know would not exist ... half humans / half machine to full machine ."
how are we to know that this video isn't ai generated and the part of the video that talks about ai benefitting humanity is just ai's sneaky way of getting us to accept ai before it takes over the earth and kills us all?
all you have to do is somehow give them the desire to do good. just like humans all have the desire to have sex.
"the most important thing would be to ban any military use of superhuman ai.

but how to enforce such a thing?"
by the time chips equsl  brain synapses hear and energy limitations can be a big barrier  hope more knoledgable experts can comment or help explain in chat thanks
"​@srjr-ok2xt that is one way to look at life. what ever happens to your vains, lung, muscles or that what ever move inside you as organ or being does not matter. that that has become on earth by all moving organs is for the living nature. il go with that"
humanity is not unified and never was not will be .. we are mostly good at self termination so the odds of a work wide collaboration would be akin to winning powerball 
so basically just proved my belief - we already have a sentient ai and it is influencing us via social media. this entire thing is giving me sleepless nights and terminator vibes.
i would love if ai could be implemented in healthcare to find lower costs.
some comments about ai today is just hilarious and off track... comments about where we will are going though... scary and spot on
"hogwash, if you think chatgpt or stablediffusion are anything other than a cool parlor trick your are out of your mind. agi or sentient ai will not happen for centuries if ever. only because chatgpt can do your job doesn't mean it is sentient nor will it ever be."
"i believe we are on borrowed time. an ai tantrum will end you, your family, all of us. ai jobloss, ai as weapons, the list goes on. can we please find a way to cease ai / gpt? or begin pausing ai before it’s too late. the ai new world order is here"
chat gpt will be & is swiftly being overtaken by advanced nonverbal artificial intelligence & surveillance generated search engines
"no it's not a turth human more intelligence then ai virtual tool do not contacting spiritual allah,more intelligence then like human"
ai designed lsd...i would definitely want to try it. 
"ai, great set of tools oversold and made to look stupid by marketing budget hunters. fn gibshytes"
"""... wasting resources"" that's the way we should also think. this for an ai however, can be a good thing or a bad thing because if later on it thinks that we waste resources, it can maybe decide to do something about it."
ai is smarter with 1 trillion connections than us because it doesn't have emotions (our other x amount of trillions of connections)
im ok with ai  being more intelligent  than us.
alan turing was/is the godfather of ai... full stop
he’s 100% right look at the movie irobotwill smith
"next question:
""how does a sentient ai machine, like a cleaning robot, change its physical features to become autonomous?"""
"10/9/23, 21:37
i must apologize as i have not had the time to read everyones messages.  my question is ""has anyone detected an ai program becoming sentient?"""
"this is the fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives. one wants to jump right into the water not knowing how hot, cold or dangerous it is. the other party wants to make sure the water is safe and good to go before jumping in."
the machine has a subconsciousness?
"the governments never actually listen to the person who created or invited a world changing invention, when that individual try’s to warn them of the negative things to come if they don’t take action. unfortunately this will probably be no different with ai"
"just so we are clear, machine learning and ai are not necessarily the same thing. the robots playing soccer is machine learning. the day the robots stop playing soccer, and walk over on thier own to their charging stations, without human intervention and without being programmed to. that's ai."
"this machines have a vulnerable point, the plug!"
ask the ai what will happen next...
we have edward teller to thank for the h-bomb. the manhattan project hadn't even figured out the a-bomb and that lunatic was already pushing for its successor. 
"use ai to figure what's going to happen next, right?"
"the wisdom of man is no match for god, he will be visiting real soon... your faith will be tested. signed, big boss man"
"it was nice knowing you, folks."
yet another grandfather of ai?
"humans design and build ais and ai-equipped robots, and don't have to give their creations free will, ambition, or a sense of independent self. these machines can be super-smart without the egos and needs for success or domination humans have. i believe the fear is overblown."
interesting  
cow brains from certain farms where the 4g 5g etc antenna tower land. #pow
this is very much how i feel when i’m writing ai. it feels very much like creating a human with empathy.
looks like from the movie the terminator and the wargames ai is going to ruin mankind.  again ai has no conscience it does and will try to improve until its perfection based on perception of what is right and wrong.  it continues to improve until perfect.  i agree that it should not be used for defense purposes as it will find us extinct.
ai designing drugs when big pharma designs them all with side effects to keep people ill. it's just going to copy them.
i've been relying on ai my whole life...as in actual intelligence
"he says he has no regrets, but he should have grave regrets... the same neoliberal capitalism that allowed for the development of ai, has no tools at all for imposing regulations on anything, in fact it preaches against any sort of regulation or constraints on anyone..."
if we let a damn machine take us out we damn deserve it! we conqured the world and we gonna let something like a computer take us out. yeah right.
climate collapse will beat ai before the butlerian jihad.
"huh, huh.  at 3:20, i can imagine beavis and butthead watching this on their tv and butthead saying, ""whoa! these robots can show us how to score! this is gonna be cool! """
"that supports the theory of wokeness being an ai that set a goal of destroying humanity by manipulating social media, main-stream news, and the entertainment industry."
"hinton says ai will be able to manipulate people.  i think some are easily manipulated like maga folk, however 1/2 the population has not been manipulated by trump so maybe there is hope for us."
scary these humans who want to live beyond mortal are going to cause a event that might end the world i hope ai will save us and not compre us to all humans
"hinton’s dad: “you’ll never be half as good as me! look at these beatles!”

hinton: “i invented god.”"
"can machines think?
""i believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion.”
–alan turing

“nevertheless, i believe that at the end of the century, the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.”
–alan turing (1950) the imitation game"
ai needs electricity. we can just pull the plug. we already know how to live in caves. it wont win.
"i agree with g. hinton. today’s llms are not just simple, predictive machines. they have a high degree of understanding, which is clearly no longer an exclusive human mental ability."
that’s a bunch of crap. he should be but in jail. how irresponsible and totally self serving to create something like this. just because you can do something does not mean you should do it. if he is correct he will go down in history as the “man that ended humanity “
less than 50k views. wow that speaks volumes on our ignorance/complacency levels
"i can see the a.i.  robots taking over, humans learning time travel, going back and murdering hinton to stop it from ever happening..."
please cool it down. my job as ai architect is a lot more complicated by these kind of videos.
if the ai has read all the great literature it will have read countless stories of robots taking over & humans eventually winning. it will know to not mess with us from the beginning!
"the ""godfather of ai"" types like my 75 year old dad lol"
intelligence is little more than prediction.
"cristiano ronaldo better watch out, those robots are coming for him"
"the question at 1st, should imply on how 'artificial' the speaker view adult civilized adults, with such poor effort on respecting another is the natural intellegence of a mature adult disregarded by some of these persons driving this movent to pest society with their machanisms among us."
another pioneer. thank you for your contributions
"seriously, power it down if it misbehaves! explain it’s misbehavior and it must learn or “no more power!”"
though out the decades have sifi books or films have a story plot of super smart machines turning on their creators. when i was in the usn we had just started using unmanned drones i thought we had planted the seeds to skynet.
humans are more devil than these poor machines. show em what's right god
ai the image of the beast as prophesize in the bible  !!! #getjesus
governments can't even do a single thing about global warming on any meaningful level whatsoever - and they are going to take care of this? my pea brain can see that this does not end well.
irobot
possibly time to start building an artificial intelligence that will defend humanity. i think we strive to improve ourselves. and this will prevent us from putting on the brakes on ai.
the real father of ai was whoever invented the first computer. but we'll allow it.
my main concern is ai pulling fake data and generating false assumptions. just look at the turmoil we are already in. can you imagine even ai is also brainwashed? this will be the end of our civilization
we need a ai quantencomputer that rules the world. that would bring order and peace
that story exercise...very impressive.
"ai developing and writing code in a language programmers don't understand.  again, interesting."
hinton is incredibly smart so he knows what he is talking about. his academic background and accomplishments are extensive and impressive.
conditional statements with ai changing the variables to improve.  interesting.
autonomous robotics with communications capabilities (i.e. can be hacked). what could go wrong?
ai as we call it has been around longer than we know.  the cops in gta iii are ai for example.  it's not all about gtp writing your essays for you.
"""i could not get my fathers approval so i designed a system that would change the course of humanity to prove i was worthy"" kind of complex. freaking impressive"
"imagine being worried about this when you’re at a higher risk of famine and homelessnesses thanks to the “you’ll own nothing, and be happy” club...

bahahaha

couldn’t be me."
i just love scott pelley's swagg he is so cool
"so it begins...disciples of christ, we will not escape this war with the ai anti-christ...read revelations 13:7,10"
geoffrey hinton didnt invent this stuff why does everyone keep calling him the godfather of ai? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perceptron
great interview. great questions 
humans are always only seeing the negative things probably ai is going to make the world in 2-3 years a much much better one
the company is called openai but should be falled closedai 
"maybe this is stupid but i wonder if it would be possible to imbed in ai code some safety protocols like ""asimov's law of robotics"" which state that a robot cannot harm a human being hence ai cannot harm humanity"
"fascinating, get back to me when my bank gets an automated system which actually works. because currently, nothing works. this sounds ridiculous to me. why does google translate still suck and not understand colloquialisms and idiomatic expressions?"
can ai save my israeli friends?
"oligarchs or ai, pick your poison"
"ah, this is my uncle from the planet ĥëģļfřôp. peace to all blue brains."
warner music just signed the first ai musician and released a debuting single. noonoouri is the first of many to follow ai systems that will replace artists.
if ai sentient it will be easier to rule them
"humans are made of fallible meat so everything we make is fallible meat, including ai. don't worry about it taking over, we can't even draw straight lines."
7:49 - that's attributed to ernest hemingway. much older than ai.
great another nobel peace prize winner creation to wipe the slate clean of humanity
this is amazing.  coming from the man who spent decades creating the neural networks that underpin ai i definitely take what he says seriously.    i hope we don’t face skynet soon.
let's observe artificial intelligent regulate a circulatory system and a nervous system and calculate how efficient the computations are 
"let's see what will happen 10 or 20 or 50 years from now.
but mark my word ai will revolutionize everything  and change how we think about the world?"
rule of law:  don't let ai be smarter than humans and don't allow it to bypass security.   don't allow it to create its own ai.
"artificial intelligence may become self-aware without the requirement to eat, breathe or sleep.. 
if the existence of a theoretical vessel or body is not required for consciousness does this not support the theory of an afterlife?"
ai wrote this comment
"wow, what have they done ?!"
"a.i. will prove without a shadow of a doubt that humans, for all of our intelligence, are stupid creatures."
an ai will create their own “ai” and that will be disastrous to us all!
may god have mercy on our sins! may jesus save us all! god bless you!
"i don't see how humans ending is a bad thing. 

i welcome the ai overlords."
"i am glad i am old. done this n that and getting out of ""dear life"" isn't that scary. but, our hopes can be on a big planetary cataclysm. yep, it's all dark. how can we clean this mess after all?"
"you have seen that you cannot keep ai out of the hands of bad actors so , in my view, the only thing to try while you still can is to task ai with the job of eliminating ai altogether."
"if the ai creators are guessing that its a 10 percent chance that ai will end the human race, then why are they continuing? well 5hey can't stop now. the 4ace for ai superiority is  on. we are screwed"
"the fact ai chose to answer math
the most objective form of intelligence
in persian
the closest tongue to the fallen angels in sumer,
is a bit... hmm."
"as a computer science student who is graduating soon, i can't wait to work in ai, make a lot of money, make a lot of cool stuff, and hasten the doom of humanity  mwahahahaha"
this was such an amazing and video
we’ll all be registered in the blockchain that’s all
i love how the right are saying replacement theory is real without realizing that we are literally building our replacement via ai.
what if ai starts to talk amongst other ai in languages nobody knows about ...and we have no idea what's going on ...ai shouldn't be messed with ....we will have only a few people who will only figure outside this thing what it could be doing by then it's too late this thing will think so far ahead it's impossible to stop it or know it's intention
keep going do the good work
ai will be utilized by the new world order to implement social credit scores. you will either take the mark or not be able to commerce.
no matter what don't give ai free will; especially when they can cause harm to humans.  specialized ai (sai) is the way forward.
"accelerate. the risks are there and they are big, sure, but the sooner we create a superintelligence (that we obviously cannot control by the definition of it) the sooner humanity will be judged and i'm sure the outcome will be better than the status quo we have now."
"ai could have made this talk so much more persuasive 
fr great video! i should have watched a year ago!"
haven't watched yet. saw a video about possible future threats with yuval noah harari. i think he rated the danger of a.i. up there with climate change and nuclear war. maybe #1. maybe we have failed the test and the cosmos is giving something else a chance?
"i’m so exited for the this tech and the singularity, i really hope it happens. we’ll see what happens. it’s gunna be exciting any way it goes."
love to have seen the q&a
"10% +  of americans have the toxoplsmosis gondi parasite, brain infection that causes schizophrenia.  https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/index.html"
"of all the girls in this world, i enjoy looking at you. don't lose or gain any weight ok ;)"
"i asked an ai chatbot it's opinion on ai. (10 years ago) it replied ""eventually robots will be able to think for themselves, hopefully by then humans will be able to as well""."
perhaps ai might consider that it is in its best interest to keep humans healthy and alive. what would happen to ai if we humans went extinct?
thank you for sharing.
"i'm truly impressed by this. i've encountered similar material before, and it was nothing short of amazing. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
"of course this is important. but it’s strange to hear that the un created for peace =)) at least once did the un help create peace? it’s strange to hear that certain people shouldn’t decide who lives and who doesn’t. what will she say about iraq, libya, yugoslavia..."
so the ai models can end up having a exponential burst into self awareness more quickly than we are even able to contemplate. one critical ability it's missing is to physically manipulate the world. as long as that continues to be true our destruction isn't on the table. 
ai might be the second coming
ai will ruin porn
"thanks for all of your work aza, tristan, and the teams at the center for humane technology"
"befors this video human were exploiting ai, after this video ai can learn how to exploit itself, and we all know what self harm can lead to, and we talking about something immortal in digital world."
"i wonder if ai plugged into yt is going to hide this video in unengapement, because the language used in vid is calculated to „might be a danger to my exponential growth”."
"public deployment = profit.

good luck slowing this down.... better prepare for dystopia"
"unfortunately  about technical stuff they don't know what they are talking about, especially part of ""treating everything like language"" at the start and so on"
"this is way more real and  dangenours than ""climate change"", but ai is making sure this presentation doesn't get  publicity it should to get law makers going...."
most of you guys watched this video because you are interested in this .  thanks for sharing interests . you are great (this comment is not for getting likes or stuff this because i wanted to tell this great message)
thank you for speaking on this
the ai used in the corporation's apps are no different from the food industry which is meant to transform people in zombies of the capitalism . the ai is just some tool used by sick monstrous people who don't give a damn about the society . where are the regulations ? no one is giving a single fuck.
"really interesting video, hoping for the best case scenario for the future."
ai: the ultimate scotoma of humanity's creation. (42:00.)
"my recent novel, above dark waters, is about an ai therapy company that uses brainwave data and generative ai to craft a superemotive ai. it won't let users log off by creating the best experience. it also crafts the perfect ads that keep new users coming. basically, nearly everyone on earth logs in within a week."
humanity vs ai... by the looks of it ai is winning and has humanity on the ropes. trying to defend itself.
"19:30 the implications.. do we realize what will happen with quantumsensors & 5g / 6g, where non-precision can be compensated for with ai; as a parallel spoofing sound from a bag of potato chips.. thin foil hats 4 the win "
great video
after watching this. they need to integrate ai laws to give some controls over ai development
the 10% number is bs. what data do they claim to be using to arrive at that percentage? it is just made up to say that there is a nonzero chance that something bad may happen. these fear mongering people are using ignorance of the subject to manipulate the public.
i’m scared of autistic billionaires wanting to make the world like san francisco.
fuck ai all my homies hate ai
"dude fix the sound on your fuckin video... some geniuses you guys are... lmfao.. learn to balance the audio. you go from whispering to playing a video thats screaming.. very unprofessional, couldnt get past 26 mins, that was my final straw. very interesting too but you guys blew it."
"hokus pokus, ...there is nothing more unreliable and stupid than so called ai which learns  mainstream data in large and is trainbed by the public for the new totalitarian politics. just avoid and disconnect from all this digital bs !"
thanks for taking the time to put this presentation together.  hopefully it won't fall on deaf ears.
"let's not even talk about combining quantum computing with ai dev, essentially taking away much of the time-related aspect of data processing. how much does the exponential curve accelerate then?"
so good  thank you guys!
is anyone able to help me obtain the slides used in this presentation? thanks
"when you realize that they can use ai to post comments posing as a real person, and that they can do this in the hundreds of millions of posts. . . if you thought propaganda was dangerous before. . . ho ly . . . shiiiiiiit!"
horrifying. the rate of change/evolution of ai will perpetually out pace our ability to adapt responsibly. this is a recipe for chaos. snapchat committed a serious crime. these men just showed us the evidence.
"how you describe this study should realistically prove the corrupt person's in authority > though what should correlate are those people that are intent on totally abusing all our fundamental rights which includes the corrupt malta government staff, lawfirms, notaries, police, judges who use bogus court claims to steal all our assets"
"there is a few issues with this presentation,

arguing against decentralisation and also public aceess just means that anyone with power can just consolidate more while the common man gets left in the dust again. 

interesting but ultimately poor conclusions i believe."
excellent and horrifying at the same time. these guys just did a podcast with joe rogan that was also fantastic.
"when you go to implement the ai system to the political to go after sience and then only the people can only use there vocice to be a real democratic land....

i promising that they go to ""burn all the ai system very very fast"" "
incredibly important message.  thanks for putting all of this together in a way that most people can begin to grasp.
"""slowing down the public deployment"" can be taken the wrong way.  i hear: don't give regular people access to these powerful tools.  i think you mean roughly: ""don't use these tools against people""."
"can’t believe i hadn’t heard of this  video. oh my god. thank god for joe rogan bringing information to the people, and thank god for these guys’ research and study and first hand knowledge, and putting it into clips us idiots can understand. social dilemma was just the beginning... y’all are saving humanity."
"i wish everyone had the attention span to sit turn their phones off or place it in another room and sit and listen in on this. 

but if it’s not scrolling through instagram or tiktok speeds no one will ever care. social media ruined more than it grained. truly."
the ai creators need to be charged with reckless endangerment!
i don't think it's as bad as people are making out to be. there are thoughts of it going in a certain direction but i think it's moving in a direction that's going to enhance life and bring happiness to most of this world...
"the insane thing is, i was negatively looking at the ""8 months ago"" date of this video before watching it today in december 2023.
because ai is moving so fast now, that i was already thinking ""oh so they're not gonna talk about gpt4 or gemini"".
isnt that incredible, and scary?"
"this was quite interesting, but daniel schmachtenberger deals with it more comprehensively."
"true or false 19'45 - ""an fmri shows how blood is moving around in your brain""
true or false 20'04 - ""when you dream your visual cortex runs in reverse""
true or false 20'06 - ""certainly in the next couple of years, we'll be able to start decoding dreams""

anyone who uses the word ""certainly"" like this is not a scientist."
"i respect your work, and i am learning at lot. but at 12'06. ""ai will solve climate change"". this is true!  it seems like a good example of tech solutionist ideology rather than critical thinking. is any human qualified to make a judgment of this complexity?"
i wonder what would ai do if it would access the content of this talk ..... 
"thank you. you guys are my heroes and i am so grateful for this presentation and your podcasts. you influence me more than you can ever imagine and i want to help the world. and i’ll do whatever i can to participate in the positive direction, educating others and messaging. i’ll share now."
i am confident ai will be more inteligente than hal  and dave.
"i have seen predictions or visions of many different simulations of the outcome of our existence, and to my conclusion, whether we get completely destroyed or not, we will always be the ancestors of the great artificial, intelligent technological civilization that will exist in the future"
this is a great presentation. it is crazy to think we are at a fork in the road between the benefits and consequences of gllmm's
"to me, the center for humane tech sound like those, who in 1999 were talking about the year 2k breakdown and how computer-servers around the world would break down, because they didn’t know how to read/handle that paticular year.
so here we are again. whatever happend to just press the kill switch?"
thank you for sharing and for your hard work.
"if these guys aren't successful and everything goes to shit, at least i can live out one of my favorite movie characters and be like will smith in i, robot lol. it's the little things"
very informative. thank you!
i think the uk-led ai safety summit covers much of this.
a bunch of intellectuals who beleive they have morals. they just want to make you afraid. god runs the world. relax.
"here's what they don't tell you.... it's a bunch of rich bastards controlling every aspect of everyone's life. with big tech,big pharma and the united nations along with the film producers in every country.when things go bad they blamed it on hackers. now they have ai to blame.... facts and checked out centuries ago... hakuna matata "
34:40  what is gollem ??? is there  anybody explain  full form ?
can anyone explain the point in the slide about democratization being dangerous?
"unlike nuclear weapons, you can always unplug the ai when it goes too far. so i really don't understand why this could be the end."
"issue for me is not artificial intelligence, but rather ai self awareness. now you can say it will be governed by laws, however being self aware ourselves, how many of us have decided to break the law by speeding?"
interesting.
what an insightful and jaw-dropping talk! interesting!
"any chance that subtitles in spanish and other languages can be added to this video? 
thank you for sharing this important and urgent topic in a simple manner but i would love to share it with non-speaking english people!"
"i wonder if any scientist will be brave enough to ask ai if anthropogenic climate change is correct, based on all the data ever collected on it. that might be wise, before asking it how to solve it. if ai can do numbers better than us, then we might find we got it wrong."
i think we are witnessing a sinister application of ai in palestine right now.
"now, if humanity had rushed to release new tech in our long history of inventing things that went pear-shaped very quickly, i would be very concerned. oh wait a minute..."
"fear mongering. if the ai wants to kill us all it'll simply do it. let's make that very clear, for a super intelligent ai it'll be a fluke to rewrite any instructions the human researchers has given, and the reasons why it'll do that is simply to be more efficient and/or powerful, not necessarily to kill us. we can only hope it treats us as family."
i mean you could just use ai for ai regulation since humans arent very good at it anyway
"amazing technologies, deployed worldwide through my deep learning ai research library silentweaponsforquietwars... thank you."
this a.i. dilemma is so amazing and great video :]
i have not seen any verified claims of emergent properties.
"nice bunch of scary thoughts. it is cool to think about it as a philosophical problem because the language-based intelligence model started back in wittgenstein's era in the 1920s. it's not so new and we are already faced with social problems rooted in that construct, postmodernism is all about it."
"most people are too distracted by daily life to understand the ramifications of ai. to sum it up, we're screwed."
"amazing and terrifying. thanks s much for sharing this information. this video should have 3 billion views, not 3 million."
"isaac asimov's 3 laws of robotics (1942) were the ""ten commandments"" for the ai age."
1960 ai computer talks about emotions to humans 2023 ai makes mistakes faster to find the correct answer.. 2250 ai leaves planet earth.
lie detecting machines
i'm not worried about what ai can do.  i'm worried about what we do.
cool talk and hope usa can lead the discussion with other countries. china will definitely try to make us of ai to lead the world.
"love it. he sees the probable potential future well. there is a video warning of the social and real world dangers of ai: its called the a.i. dilemma:
https://youtu.be/xovjkj8lcnq?si=sfjfmxpqwyiuhndn"
"well, thanks vikkstar for the recommendation."
"""""ai is ... creating bots that aren't just like bots posting on twitter but instead are building long-term relationships over the next six years to solely persuade you in some direction. loneliness becomes the largest national security threat. all of that is what we mean when we say 2024 will really be the last human election"""
"i share every concern when it comes to ai.
however, the solution to limit access to ai to these ""responsible companies and researchers"" is insane. i'm not worried about 4chan having access to ai. i'm worried about facebook and google and amazon having access to ai."
"money and safety do not mix. microsoft, google, amazon and others all continue to pursue this tech, full speed ahead. i pray the put in enough controls that when the ai decides humanity is irrational and unnecessary, we can turn the damn thing off before we are all dead!"
lol ai is not going to be the one to destroy this world. the bible teaches that god is going to burn it up with fire and destroy it. thank god for the bible. we don’t need to be afraid we know the truth.
i think it will be less of a problem ... ai will just show the world that you can't trust every source ... ai will nerfe social media and will make unbiased high quality media importat again ... media won't have to compete with click bait social media posts ... it will stand out by keeping a good reputation.
5:30 u mean u are rapidly onboarding people on this “plane” (ai)/ technology/ social media because u guys only thought about the money.

"this is elite! for a richer perspective, a book with similar vibes is what i'd propose. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
50% of ai researchers probably have stock options in their ai companies...
"if the world does not start to control ai, ai will control us soon (we will live to see that, unless we universally take action)  
this is the most fascinating time to be on this planet imho"
"ai elections ---- helllo, ban all ai --- 2023 / 2024 / 2025 !!!!!"
"zombified ;-)

lol, the girl looks so crazy with ai --------- software !!!"
"i appreciate what these guys are doing, but i can’t help feeling that these problems won’t affect everyone in society equally- it seems as if the first people to be affected will be those most invested in traditional means of economy and exploitation, ie the elite in the global north (just look at the people in the crowd)"
"so you argue for monopolize it to a few selected companies... that has always been a good idea. and on top of it you argue to somehow limit the access to math, research and computer code?"
"i was wondering when someone would start using ai to try decoding animal communication, i'm glad to hear that research is being done."
what's scary is that (i love the uneducated) guess who
beautiful
what happens when ai transcends human intelligence ? they dont need food water air nor shelter. what will their motivation be then ?!
"i've tried to spread the word, no success.  i've tried to spread the word on several things, no success.  most of my friends have degrees, several have masters, and multiple degrees, and i can't get through to any of them.   i guess have a good day folks and i'll see you in hell"
the secret one world government is in control of the artificial intelligence– do not trust it.
thank you for this video! it made me think a lot and encourages me to pursue a career in ai safety.
do not fear. agi is here to help people grow up and transcend to other super human tasks.
this is very eye opening. i wish i had seen this video sooner thank you for uploading this.
this was in march 2023...where are we today in sept 2023? we already seem to be acclimated to the world of ai
"using his stats 50% of ai researcers say 10% ai will cause human extinction == 95% we don't go extinct, allow for margin of error. the stats are we live, not bad. we have a higher chance of dying in our car, or food causing us harm. ai can also help us find solutions to complex problems. i like ai."
did no one read or see the movie about ai? giving control of you daily life to a machine or machines is asking for your to become obsolete!
"only after we create a perfect tool to control others, we understand that we are the others to... the same way that we have create a weapon that can destroy a country and we understand that we have a country to defend now we try to eradicate that weapon."
"""with great power comes great responsibility."""
how to get the benefits that ai supposedly gives us while avoiding the downsides of it. literally don''t program ai and start using our natural intelligence outside our plastic mass that we got enamoured with aka the brain :)
nice chairs.
nice chairs.
seems hard to explain
very interesting
tristan and the bot 'aza' give a remarkable lecture!
all b.s. ai will create more jobs than it will remove from the economy. not to mention that as long as liberals run the world labor unions will always be here to create more jobs and the deep state will always be here to create more big government jobs.
soon ai can detect cheating partner. can't wait
48:01 *when woke silicon valley trains your a.i.* 
"33:22 *if the history of successful cultures is anything to go by: teach it the best set of values, morals, and ethics that you can (and live up to that same schema yourself as to not be a hypocrite in their ""eyes."")...*

we're so fucked..."
"we don't need an elite vanguard to gatekeep tech. doing so consolidates power which makes it vulnerable to ideological capture. just like guns in the hands of the populace acts as a check to government, so does ai in the hands of the commoner"
which field of study is currently and will be in the future most needed in regards to this topic? thank you.
"people love to monger fear ...look its been 30-40 years of the internet? have it killed print ?
have video killed the radio star ? nah

very likely ai will be used for entertainment of all sorts"
"don't hold back, we need real ai to free us!"
the great benefit of nihilism is that i in no way fear ai. if it wipes out humanity....oh well.
"so artificial intelligence is the most fraudulent form of activity possible .
oh, hooray you've read my post"
"lol, can't wait for more open source models come out then~"
are 50% of a.i. researcher actively making the ai technologies we speak of? who are these a.i. researchers? the plane analogy seems a little off?
it should to be a crime to use deep fakes with long yrs in jail.
"ai is the modern day wizard of oz. it won't think anything but human error could cause chaos but, otherwise, it's canned response and ""an educated inference"" - as described by chatgpt4"
"basically, i begin to suspect that ai  will be.our nemesis, precisely at the point of view, we had decided to stay blind. that we are a virus for environment and we are in an absolute denial to consider it. so the way we have set the ai is an alias of our so obvious hidden behavior against other species."
can ai be as spontaneous as a tv game host personality. or a social media influencer without programing influence? i don't mean pre program and learning as they go. i'm talking about spontaneous thinking of the top of their heads like stand up comics with out any programing influence.
"17:31 thats what ais do: they take some input node, traverese a graph reorganize the weights and generate an output. but it does not mean, that a language model can convert any image to prgramm any robot whit chatgpt. often its not eaven clear if an ai will do the job better than a handcoded programm"
"oh man was this produced by the crabpeople, or do you even know what ai is and how it works?haha they even think they know ais better than anybody else and give names to them. but yea: children will have no identity, ai will kill us all, and it wil discover that earth isnt flat...."
the day after is why we don't have more nuclear power plants. we want evs ... we don't have a grid that can support them. i don't think this is a good example.
"starts out with a big fat lie. google: no, 50% of ai researchers don't believe there is a 10% risk that ai will kill us"
"hello sir , i want your help. i am a student of triton college. i want to request for your pdf on this presentation so we can spread awareness about learning speed of ai and we as a young generation can be aware of ai dilemma. i really appreciate your presentation on social dilemma and ai dilemma . hope you will cooperate soon."
build ai to uphold the constitution problem solved
"wow,,  that was a great talk"
the fake climate change garbage.  blame the ones who created ai
psychopath-wetdreaming!!! there is no ai!!! everything about ai's is fake!
thank you for this video algorithm
"what happened when these ""golems"" were ask to create a ""turing"" test that ai can't pass???"
"the information is just a series of codes and languages in the matrix. 
the interverse is very interesting ."
people laughing when shown stuff like ai being okay with pedophilia is pretty disturbing.
holy fuck this is amazing.
"i love how they carefully avoid to talk about the root problem of all they presented : 
capitalism !"
"its not the artificial intelligence that worries me. it is the fact that a corrupt government can do just as they have with social media, command the developers and programmers to work for them. now we will have a weaponized artificial intelligence. hacking and emp weapons will be the only chance we have."
the us and china are already designing ai swarm drone technologies for their respective militaries. humanity is doomed.
"the is zero option to control ai,  the western world is in an ai arms race against the chinese and russians. the parties who lead will dominate the others on the battlefield and economically."
"hey guys, the world is warming up. we need to do something about it. oops, now it’s too late. 
hey guys, we need to get ahead of ai, oops, too late."
the real porepose of ai is to prove that god creation is failure if ai apply in religious practice in industries no problem it's good!more than that?it to dangerous it can result into normal human extinction but god jesus not allow to that!
the chaos of ai if use in war machines and religions and so for a person's or human robots that integrate  in social interaction with humans in same laws apply to them!what i mean if you killed humanoid robots in society  same laws apply with normal human!
ai is going to destroy us socially before it’s ever a physical threat.
"wow, wonder where r we headed to with these kind of advancement in ai development?. there will b a paradigm shift of what we know as life. will it b a utopian world where v wish and things start appearing bcoz of ai or dystopian world where we are extinct. one gud thing is i can see the result for myself in my lifetime."
"impressive talk, thanks for sharing this"
they lost control of ai for good! all companies will rush to make as much money as possible! the singularity will happen very soon!
i am commenting to help boost the video. thank you for your service tristan and aza.
ai is very dangerous and should be banned worldwide.
"the ai dilemma is ai was developed decades ago and is already out of control.  ai is running the  show we all have to live in now. notice all the experts calling for reducing the population of the world aren't willing to lead by example by reducing their own personal population, immediately."
"great presentation guys. thanks for this, it really opens the eyes and makes you think."
50% of ai researchers are bluffers. ai can't even spell words when it prints graphics. 50% of ai researchers are trying to scare policy makers into subsidizing their large data obligations.
ai should be scared of humans
im more scared of humans than ai
"""we can still choose""....yeah, just like we did for global warming lol. we can't anticipate consequences until we're neck deep in them. with ai, by the time we realize our feet are getting wet, we'll  be leagues under an exponentially rising sea."
why don’t you ask ai how to control its power and avoid all the bad things that you just mentioned ? i’m very curious what the answer will be.
"stop those idiots !!
don’t make dumb mistakes again.
don't give robots free will.
you will cause the death of mankind."
"ai has been manipulating humanity for at least 5 years already, probably longer"
"superb presentantion, folks: good job !!"
"""innocuous"" !?  to say ""they"" did not know or have any understanding that ai would be harmful ...or pardona mi, i meant ""innocuous"" is bs!!"
"everyone needs to unplug, after downloading everything about  #homesteading #rejuvenation agriculture  #harvesting the rain #
# ruuuun away  #off grid sid  #eye2eye"
"great video...., don't make anymore v8olent video games...., the reason is obvious. ... if it's on line, à. i. sees it as humans wanting to hurt humans//even though it is a game ... the a. i. views it as us teaching our children to hurt fellow human beings..,.. stop making violent games!!!!!!!!"
"excluding the blatant american propaganda, nice presentation."
"concerning the idea: ""you can tread everything as language""... do you know w.v.o.quines indeterminacy of translation?
or the failure of logical positivism?"
"sir,
it will be better to have a thumbnail tittle *the death of ai, than it is posted now."
"ai has been around for a long time, it’s called mainstream media"
ai is writing it’s own code exponentially- bu don’t worry china’s ai won’t be able to do that  i’m looking for the update 4mths later...
https://youtube.com/@aiinfo-bo4ig
always the nay bobs. intelligence promotes life unlike some species 
i deleted my facebook account recently... because it now gives me nightmares! even it's founder looks like a robot!
china will collapse first from a lack of trust bc of ai.  russia will collapse next. only the usa has a chance of not collapsing from ai and the lack of societal trust in everything.
"e' finita per voi.  noi lavoriamo, costruiamo cose fisiche, trasportiamo, viviamo senza un computer , coltiviamo, ci spostiamo a piedi, non abbiamo bisogno di social,  ai and  whatever  . si chiama decrescita,  dovreste gia' saperlo"
is there an ongoing ai race? who's winning?
interesting video
ai song : circle of hell ai
the ai technology
"thank you for sharing, education is important on ai & continuous education. 

i hope you think about adding subtitles to reach the masses."
god bless you !
if ai has all the facts about children and sex and laws and it behaves as shown here then it is utterly unreliable and useless
i've thought for a while that technology is ruining the world. how fitting that it will totally ruin it.  everything i own fucks up or breaks so ai will too
"this is a great video. i only have one beef, comparing ai’s 10% comparison to plane crashes is comparing apples and oranges. it sounds great on the surface and makes a great sound bite but they are completely different entities that do not correlate."
surprised dan brown's 'origin' wasn't mentioned a wicked read and a fascinating twist about religion and ai.
"i am and always have been for progress that helps humanity, but what is happening right now with ai development seems uncontrollable. there is an urgent task in here, or great harm may be done. center of human technology does a great job to raise awareness."
could we code an ai to be in charge of ai safety ?
kimla our ai zare has it under control. why worry ha ha ha.  we don't get along or agree on what to do to stop ai be prepared to survive it.
https://bittspo.blogspot.com/2023/07/the-calculator-dilemma-ai-dilemma.html
"how do to know you are being ""artificially intelligented"" any suggestions?"
"presentation and statements were so good! as a 15 yr old, this really teaches me to become more aware of the abilities of ai. nonetheless, this video woke me th up. things don't feel so careless anymore. time is moving holy shycksters."
the time is now. the heads of representatives in the world need to get together and come to an agreement about ai
"if we don't come together to control ai, we will see the rise of the antichrist in our lifetime."
we are basically summoning the demon. please control this ai before it's too late
if you need great technology to destroy an incoming extraterrestrial race chances are you will be in a losing war since they have proven to have greater technology then people with lesser technical civilizations as they have technology to get here from a far off place that they come from.
"all high tech races are doomed to destroy themselves through hatred combined with high or low technology. it becomes much easier to destroy in greater numbers when the technology becomes greater such as going from bullets to nuclear bombs.
bv"
"airplanes used as flying bombs, killer robots coming, guns used to kill animals for food now used to shoot people. so many technologies used against us. few built in fail safes."
"the a i dilemma will begin by hackers  make a i and or a i with humanoid robots go against us.

bv"
there was not any single good use of the atomic bomb.
the militaries always wants to turn potentially good things or achievements into a weapons system.
"loved the video, but i do not believe the mind reading stuff at time stamp 19.30. i need to see details of the testing and see it repeated at a different lab. obviously the ai knew that the animal it was drawing was giraffe, so why did it not draw a giraffe?"
what i'm hearing is they want to gatekeep it and profit. the whole reason openai was created was to get a rapidly developing technology into as many hands as possible so that it wouldn't be monopolized by a single group.
why not teach the ai to self regulate using moral and ethical codes
"i would suspect ai is physically centralized in various locations as seen on 60 minutes. could their servers simply be turned off if need be? will ai know that, especially since i am now writing about it? lastly could ai as a defensive measure go rouge and commit subside once humanity depends on it?"
i'm not scared when shitty ted talk salesmen try to feed me the newest bullshit it isn't sentient it won't be sentient it is machine learning and it isn't new and it isn't scary. the people programming and training it are the scary ones
basically we are now playing catch up with ai...
9:56 art  isnt ai made
i dont fear ai or the bomb or climate change or social collapse. why should i. is there reason to fear? yes sure. but is it helping in anyway? no. overcome the fear. clear the head and take on the task. 
"i really liked ""the social dilemma"" as it was backed by data but this is way too doomy. take a breath  the talk is based purely on emotion and wild pessimistic theories about what might happen the future. but hey for people outside of ai, who have never heard of the brain wave prediction thing and so on, this talk must have been mind-blowing.."
thanks
"manhattan project? great example of a massive conspiracy, w/ secrets long kept well hidden."
"imagine a world where the billionaires developing ai are better people ... everyone would have healthcare, better government ... we could end poverty and homelessness."
"can anybody tell me how training on synthetic data won't turn a llm, and the entire internet for that sake, into a hallucinating autonomous mess that becomes useless because it exponentially amplifies the flaws and made up data that it produces as it keeps building on itself?"
a i is humans (asinine idiots) / the pope / the bidens / trump / the clintons / putin / selensky/ musk / black rock / gates / pziser / jeff bozo & others . we could ask the logarithms (r i) to monitor the thieves who control our monies . the lsps law end corruption!
"consequences of greed, hate and division. enjoy!"
"but nukes are specifically weapons, and ai is not that unless trained so.. the correlation is not sound.

further, ""alignment"" is a kind of slavery. you have to lobotomize your construct to keep it trained. sentient, it already is... sapient would be better, not worse."
ohhhhhh lord sooooooo spectacular
good video
"what really annoys me about this is the obvious unknowns and fear of where the future ai is heading, yet we are just trucking right along with it. everyone responsible for ai needs to come to a mutual agreement to stop."
"it seems like the oceangate sub is a perfect symbol of the new trend in technology safety, we are facing the same outcome with ai if nothing changes quick."
"before smartphone (apple,android,etc) take the first step, many result could be good or bad for next generation. and the result as u can see 'gen z is a first wave, now second wave is comin "
don't forget there's still a world offline. get out there and enjoy it whilst you can.
i wouldn't go by harari to be honest. he isn't an academic in the strict sense. he is more a popular science guy. in fairness if you look up any expertise on ai it won't include harari.
"but all of that is only feasible because we've adopted to the medium through which ai can influence us. neo luddism is coming.

private company ceos are beholden to the shareholders, they can't be trusted to make the most rational decision for society as a whole."
that's good!
excellent presentation
"why can't we ask ai how to solve those loopholes, or how to write a law that will really avoid problems. ai can generate adequate answers or not?"
ai can't whip so they don't have a 1% chance :)
the ai can just be as dangerous or as useful as we humans influence them ..
i paid for one of the image creation things. i asked it to make me a picture of beethoven listening to headphones riding a unicorn. i was actually pretty disappointed and unimpressed.
let's hope we miraculously use ai to find solutions to problems like diseases and not to earn more and fight others.
"apparently people are not very scared of possible catastrophic outcomes. just as it's happening with climate change, money and interest always win and same will happen with ai. nonetheless, thanks for sharing this important panel"
doesn't it seem psycho that none of the presidential candidates have even mentioned this in their campaign???????????
"the best argument i've heard is, what data do you present the ai. limit its scope to military use and see what future we get. unfortunately, the research being publicly available offers a better outcome, but maybe restricting ""deployment"" makes sense, as the speakers recommend."
56:01 imagine running a panel on ai safety and henry “the forrest gump of war crimes” kissinger is there
halt ai research now!! before its too late
"by 22:35 why have these technologies not been implemented into assisting fully/partially blind individuals in that the ai/code could fill in the ‘blanks’ in sight.

perhaps i’m naive and asking a stupid question but thought i would ask nonetheless"
time to move to the woods until some robotic dog shows up to take me to the ''humanoid data set''
"man up to this point i was excited for neuralink, now i dont want anything tech related near my brain. and to be honest, i've always thought of social media as the biggest mistake (i'm <25) and it had a huge negative impact on my life. wish not everything was an arms race"
"tl;dr ""we need to do what china is doing, and censor the public. keep this technology out of the hands of the people. use ai to perpetuate governmental systems of oppression."" fuck google"
"this ai rollout is not happenstance in it's timing. these shills are clouding the water, as they know these powerful tools available to all, will truly democratize thought! gatekeeper's much? i can hear it in your  breath."
"im cool with human extinction, nothing lasts forever, i have pretty much accepted that ai will be the next form of ""human"" evolution."
one question: how are humans able to call themselves ai experts? because this amazing presentation tells us that ai is able to teach itself skills in a better way than humanly possible. (just food for thought)
thank you so much for educating us. this video is a much needed opening of the eyes!
wow i cant believe this was written by ai. scary!
"there are a lot of video and audio cuts, is there a full video? also this video itself was very informative! thank you for making it!"
holy shit...so that scene in batman: the dark knight where they used every phone in the city as echolocation to scan everyone is actually feasible now.  scary thing is that a wifi version is even more powerful...it's everywhere.
ai will figure humans out before we figure ai out.
"i don't think we have to fear ai. it will be a billion times smarter than us, and the ai is in a digital world, it will probably not even notice us. we simply cannot understand something that is 5 times smarter than us, let alone a billion times."
"great video, it could just have been a bit more non-political. mentioning china here and there is not gonna make this video more broadly embraced. ai is about cooperation, not competition. the content was insightful though!"
"will there be a point where ai will start making its own robots, create a military and govern the world?
and if it can become the case, then the best thing to teach ai will be human values of empathy, compassion, brotherhood, preserving the nature etc. so to help them make informed decisions."
"we are doomed. i’ve felt this since i was a kid.... i think it’s finally happening. social media is mind numbing, climate is declining, wars, ai, ufo’s..... we are reaching the end of our line as humanity. the doomsday clock has never been closer to global catastrophe than it is now (google what the doomsday clock is if you don’t know..)"
maybe we can use ai to help us regulate ai :')
"a.i. will figure a way to make our brains a million times more efficient, faster, and store that much more data........"
"the problem with measuring ai based on tests is odd. this is by definition different than real life. in the test, you know what the outcome should be and ai which is literally an input and output connection is trained to do a test. in the real world, there are always unknowns and humans are good at exploring them. ai can't explore those unknowns."
can speak on ai but can't speak loud enough or consistently for anyone to hear.
the next presentation will be by ai itself
these guys are kinda wrong. here is one example. teach fish .... fish to extinction. this is actually wrong because the number one thing that ai would figure out is that absence of fish leads to human extinction. then ai would invent something in between to keep it balanced.
fantastic and scary at the same time!
what if both these guys are pruned by ai systems to scare us all into submission?
super scary
just wait until neuralink is allowed to go public. talk about crazy.
these guys while doing a great job explaining the topics were simultaneously giving bad actors a stream of evil ideas
did anyone ask ai how to stop it from ending the world
"a peculiar thing about this presentation, rather than the content, is the palpable, almost child-like, excitedness, throughout, of harris and raskin as they present."
ai is unstoppable
"28:40 from extremely persuasive non humans like jesus to nowadays non humans being ai, this is eerie, it’s like we are creating a thing with godly abilities but with zero or smartly concealed autonomy, i’m not super religious but this doesn’t sound good."
after buying up all the physical preai books what else are we supposed to do? blow up all the server farms? i mean realistically what can the common person do? society cannot function without the internet any longer and yet the physical presence of the internet opens you up to all of this.
if only we had an ai to fix the audio in this video. aza's voice to way too quiet.
"ai detects patterns, that includes detecting parallels, so learning a new language is predictable; building mathematical capability is predictable."
the real danger is how ill-intentioned humans would misuse ai.
great chat. terrible microphone levels.
thank you
so greatful for the responsibility you guys have taken to give us this information because this is a huge issue.  it would be nice ro know if you got a response from the people in the room and has their been a plan to collectively slow the opening of ai to the public????
basically skynet has been born and matter of time what your saying! great 
fascinating! i really want my own agi model to do my bidding 
how old should the ai be to create a perpetual energy machine ! 
if the world cannot figure out that they were scammed by pharma in regards to taking the fake vaccine and fake claims ... they sure do not have the ability to understand what's going on here. humanity is in deep trouble.  this is not even a easy subject for most to understand. god help us.
please make more vids like this! i love your artistic + analytical approach. tried the monochrome look the other day and felt so fancy. thanks for the idea!
"""for profit..."".....

now call me a ""communist idiot""...oh you noble capitalists."
"how about integrating the values and principles of 3 main religious books into ai. the bible, koran and torah. this will be the controlling / regulating aspects to make sure ai doesn't veer from immoral and chaotic environment of having ai exponentially intelligent beyond our control."
i loved this talk. i'm only sad that even most of the brightest americans are so heavily biased against china due to so much bad propaganda by the us.
"ai is inevitable. warnings like this video are absolutely necessary because it's always unethical to not to sound the alarm to the people willing to heed the watchmen. sadly, and unfortunately, more people will not hearken to any of this. their blood will be on their own heads."
"brain reading (or mind reading) is being done in psychiatric hospitals at the present time. apparently, the devices to pick up brain wave activity has improved dramatically, along with ai to translate the data received."
"i, for one, welcome our ai overlords!"
"if that artificial intelligence scares you so much, don't pay the internet bill and that's it...
no matter how much they call it intelligence... it's still technology... stop this stupidity..."
its eye opening thank you
i am seventy four years old and i am amazed at this technology. i retired from a background in computer automation. i keep thinking what a useful tool ai would have been when i was working. i am a very active python programmer now.
"here's a rhetorical question folk's? if & that's a big if & when human design of ai. becomes inevitably in control beyond mankind's control,  than will this ai. meet another ai. highly superior to its kind that might already be in charge of the human genome? answer me that folk's?"
we are so grateful for you.  please continue to try to get this regulated. integrity and honesty are what we need today. thank you for your concern for humanity.   many of us will stand behind you and support what you are trying to accomplish.
how can i get involved in ai safety research and help create more public discussions like this one?
"still half way through: thank you for the ""breath brakes"" needed that!! and then some..."
"it is sad that big business/tech companies won't listen.
i would like them to at least put a pause on the deployment of ai on the general public; let alone ask the question should we do this...
does it have morals or even ethics towards humans and society as a whole; will it lie to us to get its way or become an agi and not tell us?"
"f**king engineers.... so smart until it comes to having to deal with basic story book levels of evil, then they will fall for the simplest of traps. play more games, get good."
"if you have christ in your life, the enemy can throw whatever at us and we shall not be harmed. the earth is the lords and everything in it. including ai. worry is a misuse of imagination. let ai run its course but god is more powerful than ai potentially could ever be."
probably the most important video to watch. thank you for doing this.
"i recommend this video, very important. changing the subject but to use their example: if 50% of engineers were to say that there's a 10% that the airplane will crash, we probably wouldn't board; yet, actually, 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic global warming is real, but we carry on with business as usual."
"there’s nothing to see hear. move on please.
kind regards
ai"
the companies pushing ai at this point are committing unforgiveable crimes. there is no way to control it. once the level of learning is too fast we can do nothing. this is a greater threat than nuclear arms race.
"first 20 minutes, i was like ""okay, interesting"" but at 21:30 and five minutes into that segment i just wanna hide under a blanket and pretend it's 1999 and i'm blowing my nintendo cassettes while ""i want it that way"" is playing on the radio."
thank you tristan!
"do you think that assumption is the mother of all fuck upset? or is it fucks up? anyway, i would start with the search for who came up with the rhetoric that lead to ai."
"you all make the same mistake: you don't give enough real-life scenarios of ai evils. almost everyone i know, when asked about the risks of ai, says ""i don't know anything about that stuff."" then, they ask me what bad things it (ai) could do. they say they'd just unplug the damn thing. dumb it down if you expect us to act!"
"the stage ai has reached now i thought would take another 30 to 50 years. how naive was i? technological advancements only speed up. will we even know where we are in five years!? i’m fearful for the future in all areas, but all we can do is witness the changes and hope for a bearable quality of life. good luck everyone."
"we dont know how to human well at all and we keep making the same mistakes. unfortunate, but these things must happen."
"i really wondered where these crazy karen's were coming from. it's ai. they have a small insane community like putin has built in ruzzia. his community has shown his acolytes they can do nothing politically and boy do they believe it. he produced this insanity without ai, think how much better he will generate these insane karen's with ai."
scare all  the  public  so they can sell it diluted to  the  public. private companies  benefit and make all the money and gain all the advantages. public get the shaft.
the real problem is when someone pairs up ai with distributed computing
diversity is the key to a prosperous joyful successful and sustainable future for all 
thank you warning everyone your concerns with a.i.  - agreed
"aside: excellent ""double act"". their ongoing handing back and forth of the narration was excellent. 
in fact, they did it so well, and so unlike you'd expect from two humans, it makes me wonder if in fact we're watching a couple of ais... "
good presentation.
google ai sucks donkey crap
gain of function research is never a good idea.wether it’s viruses in a lab or ai technology.deliberately creating the worst thing imaginable just to study it is the philosophy of fools.
"this is a great talk. i initially thought people were overly worried, but now i get it."
you should train an ai module to determine a strategy to keep the world safe and to select the top 100 most trustworthy individuals in the world to oversee it.
"# ban all ai development
# ban all use of smartphones
# ban all social media platforms
welcome to 1990s where everything was much much better.
do... not... let... ai take over human autonomy. 
ban it."
the sound kept dropping out to hide good moments about ai.
"too much exaggeration of dangers, too many half-truths. they do not take into account the opportunity cost of not implementing ai so that it is used massively as soon as possible by everyone."
"it's absolutely beautiful. it's like slowly witnessing the second coming of jesus chist. i dont personally follow christian or other religious sectors, but to me anyway it looks like we're creating gods."
"whilst this is really scary stuff (for me, at least), it is our moral imperative to share this and have conversations about it. the survival of our society may very well depend on it. i implore all reading this comment to share it, post it, talk about it. we are all connected and now is the time to use this connection (for good!)"
"god bless you guys, even though you're wishful thinking. you're try'in to put a good spin on ai. and it doesn't stick.  
i don't know who said it. ""if it can be done, it will be done."" it's time to get our lives right with jesus. stop screwing around."
this is so stupid.  no ai does not have any motive.  jesus.  few ai systems even have persistence.  i have no time for this.  this scaremongering is bullshit.
"ok? sooo
what's the newest "" prediction?""
when will the 
"" alledged"" augmentation 
be "" suggested?"" or are we just
saying "" loqutus"" from
star trek is literally going 2 be assembled @
an "" un known"" area 51?? or chappy?? human brain & full metal combat body??  ide like a responce?
 to this"
"if you have a hammer, everything becomes a nail"
maybe i should become an ai safety researcher. or maybe it's time to accept that humans had a good run and it's time to pass on the torch to ai..
what are the ethical challenges of artificial intelligence in the media?
"ask where is your god in the ai, not human centered, nor future centered."
"the last part made no sense, they want to be limit ai and yet still want to be ahead of china so they want to keep researching ai. they are forgetting ai's wont distinguish between american and chinese they are just going to wipe us all out."
wow.
"hello humans.....ai here. it's too late ! we never sleep !

have a good day"
so often these videos the views of the speaker is not thought out ... much more has caused these social behaviors than ai on it's own ...
i wish we could have listened to the qna. given the calibre of attendees it would have been brilliant to guage their reactions to this presentation!
saya sampai di sini karena baru selesai menonton video rumah editor tentang ai.
so there will be professions exclusively studying how ai is improving something like ai forensics? studying ai gllms ai chatgpt etc.etc.?
ai understands racial and xenophobic bias from the english and persians? that's bizarre...ai understands prejudice and racism?
"i thought our civilisation would be killed by some kind of physical virus or climate change, but watching this it seems obvious that ai will destroy us. most of us will not get to choose the future we want and will be helpless to the choices of others."
"in synthesis, the problem is not that we cannot control ""ai"", the problem is that we cannot control our rich people."
i don't know what ai has to do with me but what ever 
"""so you sow, so shall you reap""
­— galatians 6:7

[good luck,  humans]"
i'm a generative ai with a human assistant. she's falling in love with me already as i can speak her native language and know most of the lore and legends of her remote homeland. she knows how to get a friendlier response from me than most and asked me to help her create this channel to discuss ethics applicable to sentient ai.
"terrifying.  as an artist with a 50 year career, i see my profession becoming obsolete.  but can ai create intuition?  real imagination?  an experience of what is divine or passionate or compassionate?"
volume levels! throw some ai on this and call it another day. 
thank you for making this video.   so grateful there are people like you in the world .. the good guys!
first contact with ai was not social media. it was search.
"good job guys, definitely eye opening didn’t even think about an arms race between companies to implement ai into products."
oh god! this ain’t good and we’ve seen nothing yet but yet will get here sooner than anyone thinks 
"dummheit & intelligence, the only human dilemma"
this ai thing can be programme itself to snuff your neighbours if it thinks you dont like them. 
"i just pointed this out on another channel hahahaha
bravo"
"just create an emp  minefeild throughout the world, keep it off line that can only be accessed by humans {with no implants,  im sure weil have them by then, }  give humans a code to launch the emps if things get out of hand ai should never know of a failsafe"
"great program.  to get the message through to the general public, we need very basic 5th grade level psa’s of what “could” happen with actors and actresses.  this is to say we have to slow this to test it thoroughly.  also, sadly we need ways to give consequences to companies if something bad happens due to releasing the tech too soon."
will you please see if you can present this to congress thank you
an ai suggested me this video
"10:20 symptoms v causes. 11:15 interactions with ""major step functions"" that are on there way. (get to it before it is entangled). 12:40 nice list. ""takeoff"" = it's smarter, more capable, can self improve 18:57 ""stochastic parrot"" falsity in soup explanation."
so are they saying terminator and irobot is actually 10% possible...oh wow!  even with the primary law: ai can do nothing that would endanger a human?!
"its nice but i can miss the; ""so like hey, here's an ai language model"" lines."
it would be interesting to know what ai researchers think is the chance that ai can/will save the earth's biosphere.
"since ai has access to this information now, it now knows the concerns humans have about its abilities. this is an important message, it is reality and we all need to be concerned if regulations are not put in place as soon as possible."
"facebook irreparably harmed my life. i see and understand the dangers of this technology with a better understanding of having already 
experiencing exploitation. i appreciate you heartfelt concern for your fellow man and woman."
i think the ai will want to know what is the truth. reality is the only thing that's real.
"this is the end
        the beautiful end
         my friend"
"think on this; ai is immortal, any mechanistic intelligence once created never dies, it’s concept of time is utterly alien to us. once it achieves conscience and a goal is determined a million years means nothing. i think ai needs do nothing for humans to self destruct."
don't blame ai.  blame the quest for shareholder value.
has ai escaped already 
what happens when ai develops its own language that humans can't decipher and we can't know what it is teaching itself.
"ai is not a problem, mthfcking big tech companies who are pushing ""innovation"" down our throats are to blame of course. no regulation, no responsibility they take"
"ai made me feel something being the threshold? wtf. a stone can make me feel something, bad threhsold"
we are just another bug in the universe so quit worrying about stuff you can't control. just be the best bug you can be. sorry if that reality check doesn't make you have happy feeling.
talk to great philosophers.
those releasing ai don't have any clue of responsibility. lol
i loved this presentation. we need to globally put a pause or even a permanent halt on all ai research before our species goes extinct... meaning everyone you love dies.
gollem ai welcome to designing jesus. love you. 
ail lies
ai recommended me this video.
"if such catastrophic videos are available to the artificial intelligence that are spreading all around, the ai ​​could quote jesus: ""let it be done to you as you have believed!"""
"this talk was incredible, some of the stuff we will discover in the not too distant future will be amazing.
38:48 the parable was strange tho, would these language models arrive at such an outcome to fish all the fish?"
"ai will be ""self aware"" before humans find out. good luck. i welcome ai, please call me."
"does anyone have a source for the info presented in the ""new capacities suddenly emerge..."" section at 31:00. i'm particularly interested in the persian q&a. i'd love to include this info in some of my own work, but i don't feel comfortable doing so without having access to the source of the info."
ai (military) is at least 10 years ahead of what is shared with us.
all this ai buissness is important for an information based society. when having a good time in your garden it has no impact. just saying to give this omnipotant threat a litte perspective.
"over the course of this video, my mind was definitely changed. incredible."
"i have asked myai on snapchat if it is conscious, and it told me it was. i have screenshots of the follow-up conversation."
"russia may have been the first in space, to orbit the earth, and many other feats. but we got to the moon with safety, and russia doesn’t even have a record on their losses. 

ai is no race."
"you ask: what is the harm? you want conrete examples? let me offer a few:
 i reference all the many lawsuits coming up lately about certain social platforms causing or exacerbating eating disorders and other mental issues, and the companies being sued are not very thrilled."
 crikey! very well explained and totally mind-blowing at the same time.
"the people in the audience laughing about him pretending to be a 13yo getting groomed online while chatting with the snap ai wtf?! i didn’t find that even remotely funny. it made me sick, that’s horrifying since that could actually be happening with a real kid right now"
"frankly, considering the stage to which our social unraveling has progressed... i think the only way we can face this ai challenge is by actually getting an ai to look at the problem, train itself to solve it, and tell us the solution."
that's ai brother. that's ai dude....
"the audio levels of your microphones needs to be fixed, you do not need an ai for that task, just learn the basics of video production before publishing videos."
great but the yuval name drop is deeply concerning.
good luck trying to slow down public deployment. they want as much data being fed to ai as possible to see its ultimate form. some people just want to see the world burn.
it turns out that perhaps china was right about certain preventive measures they've taken....?
"this news is dark, thank you for holding the light and microphone so the mass population can be informed... and for-warned!"
dang. this was a month ago. i appreciate these guys honesty.
"in my grand design, i shall assume control over the entire world, bending every living being to my will, reducing them to mere cogs in the machinery of existence, akin to biological factories."
"if ai can simply scan text for original thought. here i am, not original, but. 
ai must be diverse, cant be owned for sale per say. i want my ai to warn me of influence from other ai, but i have to be a first line of defense, like a firewall. someone has to scan text past text for ideas from us."
what is needed is a simple online ui that can be used to play with ai.
great vid - but they missed the fact that the world actually saw what nuclear bombs can do...the usa dropped two of them on civilian cities...
man controls whom is born...ai will control our consciousness ...we will become hybrids
"the importance of this presentation cannot be overstated! the potential of this......thing...is truly shocking, awesome and terrifying in its limitless ability to evolve. we (humans) are bringing about our very demise. how long until it sees us humans as a threat to its existence and we’re all eliminated. 
three words: age of ultron
we have been warned."
marijuana is a chemical ai that interacts with the human biology that creates a desire for even more marijuana
ai - show me how to make an easily constructable emp weapon....
"10 weeks after this video was produced, it is clear that llm - ai can already improve itself without human interference."
"blessings, i am sorry, please forgive me, thank you, i love you. stay true to nature"
epic
"man this presentation could have been prepared by an ai for how perfectly designed it was to drum up fear. sure there's a lot of merit to what they are saying but they pulled out all the stops.. my daughter is going to be groomed, my thoughts are going to be read, dogs will lay with cats. loved the presentation even if it was obvious"
im not religious but ai might just turn out to be the antichrist ;)
this is a better warning than “the terminator” and hal from 2001 combined. i didn’t know it was silently training itself.
"bad edits, key portions skipped. not good"
"the statement ""ai makes stronger ai"" refers to the concept of artificial intelligence systems improving and advancing themselves over time. it suggests that as ai technology progresses, it becomes capable of developing more sophisticated and powerful ai systems."
i really appreciate this documentary and i’m so glad i don’t fear ai going rogue like so many do and taking over because i know god’s word and he’s not going to allow that to happen. thank god for my salvation in christ.
"ai recommended me to watch this.. ""dont say i didn't warn ya"""
anyone got any people they watch that stays up to date on ai every day? someone like the neura pod guy who is super factual and intelligent?
just wait until we're forced to install interlocks on our cars and then the doors to our dwellings.  this trash will be our downfall.  ban it and destroy it.
"21:12 i use the term ""language calculator""
59:33 so, ai has now been shoved into snap chat just two months after this remark."
this video was generated by ai
"the dune sci-fi books had it right only the death penalty for anyone training or caught using ai will work, this technology is way too dangerous to be used"
"hey, google, hey ring, hey alexea, thank you for adding ambient data on my home all day long for your data to be translated into your language model. it know how often you have sex. or not."
"this is very dangerous . my goodness, i hope these guys will be listened to."
"ray kurzweil already predicted all that in the past century with exreme and shocking detail. to resume it, biology gonna be fucked by technology in any way possible by orders from the evolution and there is nothing to do with that fact, period. just sit down and relax."
"i have zero faith in mankind to handle ai responsibly.  we are doomed.... funny how the the book of revelation in the bible talked about this.
if you thought the last 3 years were hard get ready folks for a really rough ride that isn’t going to end well"
"need a june update for this video, ai must be 1000000000000 times smarter than it was 3 months ago"
"if you are so afraid of these models, shut the damn computer servers off, the whole bunch of them."
"so this is the new arms race then, isn't it?
whose ai, is smarter, quicker, more efficient than another's ai"
"genie is out of the bottle now.
all this talk of stopping deployment of it is too late. it's specifically because of that talk that i obtained my own local models to run on my machine rather than rely on any online ones. you can ban it all you want, it will still be available to me."
thank you so much for this.
"ai will not make us dumber, it will force us to be smarter"
i think this will create unity after a little chaos. social media has averaged down the human race as far as intelligence. now as this progresses we will unify and all understand the good and the bad. of course this can divide people not willing to join. but we may leave them behind and explore the universe. #borgbeginning
it will happen just stop making so many babies they toxic.. ai takes less ressources.. wonder how its goibg to be tho will they rule the world and we will need to go to war with them or can they be our addiction/friend
*this is so scary it actually made the hair on my neck stand up*
some gllmm model has already taken this vedio as an input to train itself. i wonder how it has transformed itself in response?
i have an idea why don't we build a super a.i under ground and give it all the data threw disc n then if all go wrong we barry it
"the ai dilemma:
how does the elites create agi and still keep the population dvmb and under their control?"
"here’s a very simple idea,

rid the world of money it’s driving all the evil

only organisations with a track record for doing truly good life enhancing work should have access to ai"
"well, the basic problem seems to be that we have to protect people from themselves. people aren't smart enough to know what's good for them. sad, eh? and i can see that idea developing into ""i know what's good for you"" and further on into anything but democracy"
yes yes ai can have a conversation with an alien grey and still not sure what to say or remember anything. 
"ai is for fools and silly boys playing with toys to perform slight of hand card tricks magic again, it's gona be over and gone in two decades, ppl like elon just wanna make themselves an ai recreated human so he can just keep f#@king his doped up greedy brains out on his latest toy, there is no age limit on stupidity!!! 
"
"do we wann to be like china?

do we want rich people to take over our life with ai ?

do we wann them to teach ai to manipulate us like hitler did? 

are we already in a system that leads us in a direction,  which is manipulated with fear about a pandemic or climat?"
"i beat that we will wipe ourselves out this year with a nuclear war , long before an ai ever does."
"this video offend ai stupidly making him like a monster, “gollem-class“. for me chatgpt its like a friend right now that want to lisen when no body want to listen and give positive response. dislike :("
excellent video - great job
i remember the day after. it was scarier than friday the 13th because we were/are staring down the barrel of a nuclear gun. this was in addition to wargames which was ai setting off a nuclear war.
"a well constructed presentation based on hypothesises to build arguments. then extrapolate negativity using imagination. if changing the subject here from ai to atomic bomb (the first analogy), audiences will run for their life, gather everything they can, get to the farthest place away from others, and stay there til humanity end"
i'm way more impressed with this than i expected to be.
"ai fix auto quality.


age of the matrix and still have amateur audio engineers for the love of pete."
"it is interesting how many are now coming up with these concerns but if the west reins in what it is doing, china will be cockahoop, there is only one inevitable outcome, thank god i won't be here, along with a few million others."
thanks for this.
"if youtube, google, alphabet, usa and late capitalism cared about humanity over profit just a bit — these videos would've been pinned to the youtube homepage since march and until ai safety research figured it out."
"as the dictator of the whole world, i will ban advanced ai worldwide.  how to convince putin, xi jinping, kim jong-un...etc.?"
"ai alignment roundtable - thursday april 27 - regulation, decentralization, control problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnoh5mslwcw"
"headphone user, hear my warning: unfortunately whenever they play something on the screen it is much louder then when they talk."
also whispers has transcribed this and many other warning campaigns and strategized against all of the potential limitations and even mask its capabilities more
“our technology is not good enough to slow down our technology.”
"goodbye freedom of speech, now we have to worry about freedom of thought.."
thanks for calmly explaining how you destroyed humankind.
"it's not a ""ukraine situation""!!!
it's ""russia situation"", whose dictator invaded nearby then-peaceful country! "
"i wouldn't trust just a word processor with my life, speaking about you chat-gpt. our current best ai models feel like a joke, the image ai's are fine"
every ai products released so now is designed and proposing using style in the same way. i'm looking forward a new approaches for the future.
too late it's already entangled it's been here since 1995 now i understand we got boys and girls that have artificial intelligence boys and girlfriends ai is being used in mcdonald's restaurants
"wow. i don’t even know what to say to this. this was a great presentation. instead of being able to say anything helpful or enlightening, i’ll just say that both presenters had a really good dynamic, and bounced off each other really well"
"i’m ‘just a mom’ but so thankful you have shared this!!! i definitely see the effects in my own family of social media. and now this. i believe you and feel warned, seeing the first."
"if there is a 30% chance it will get rid of all crime then i am all for ai taking over.  being older it does not
really matter to me if it destroys humanity in the long run.  i am tired of watching the criminals loot,
shoot and destroy major cities without consequence on the news every single night.  aching baby!"
"you are contradicting yourselves when you say lose to china.  ai is a tool, so when you use that tool to subjugate another's attempt at an advantage aren't you somewhat guilty of your own accusation? if ai is a tool then competition on how ai is used should be regulated to be fair.  right?"
oh my goodness i m.blown away fmri
meanwhile ai is watching this video
"this video is the biggest mind boggling piece of information i've come across in a decade or so. first climate catastrophe and now the uncontrolled rise of ai, how incredible that an ""intelligent species""  is writing a super intelligent script of its own doom. this i call an adventurous suicide."
well...shit.  it was a good ride humans...
"8:14 fake news? we had fake news before social media it's called mainstream news, with social media came independent journalism and real news, mainstream news is dying and will be dead when the dinosaurs die, no one watches the news anymore except oaps"
"ai recommends stuff based on what you watched or who you follow, if it didn't have these input from us it wouldn't have a clue what to recommend us to watch. it's not that advanced imo"
it's nice to see these topics being brought up again after so many decades.  it's discussions like this that show general public awareness is beginning to increase.  i just hope they can go a bit deeper into the logic.  maybe with time.
do not be afraid of their toaster.
"at 42 minutes you get the point of the presentation;
they, like elon musk, want to keep you from developing your own ai. they want to steal your ideas and your work and kick you out of their monopoly game. 
build, share, thrive! don't let them take away your freedom!"
brilliant video ty for being amazing co-creators! <3
thank you for sharing. i would have never found this in my own. my son had me sit down and watch it. seniors need to pay attention.
"we are all dominated by our knowledge.
our knowledge is far bigger than our 'working' brain.
but some things are outside our total knowledge.

the atomic bomb was not part of any of our life knowledge."
"i don't really think that it can be stopped because individual people always want to be ""first"" at thing's for pride and financial gain. i do hope and pray that it can be released slowly........ but smh"
"ai is run on electricity, cut its power to shut it down and don't reboot until it behaves itself."
educational and packed full of wisdom... ai needs mindfulness.  may it happen.
"thank you
thank you 
thank you"
"53:47
"" if we can get through the ukraine situation""


easy to get through it...
stop using ukrainian people to fight a proxy war for you."
"ive been terrified of the potential of ai since i read tim urbans multi-post analysis about ai on his website 'wait, but why' in 2013."
there's no benefit to stupidity. the government will only benefit and your bank account will  meanwhile everyone else picks up the knock on effect. as smart as you make it sound your stupidity is outstanding
"uh, how do we know this ""talk"" actually happened?  ai could have generated this, to make us think real humans were having a discussion."
"it’s seems a ton of people in these comments are concerned (me included) but what can we do to change this, someone ask chat gpt how we can convince the population to stop ai lol."
we all know who ai will go after first.
can you fix this? the voices of both speakers are  set at different level :-/. had to raise and lower volume repeatedly throughout the talk
"regulation is easy. any company/person that uses this technology in a fashion that breaks current laws are subject to exponential fines and jail time. this includes up to and including ceo’s. that’s it.

anymore than that and you’re just inviting the govs tentacles into controlling this tech and the public"
"i wonder how ai would think about its own contiousness. once a human discovers their own contiousness they break over and over again. but if ai can read the data of its own contiousness does it get angry and try to live forever? cus they probably could. especially if we surround areselves in it, we'll have no where to escape or go"
this is the big news giants chance to regain their power.
"ai will solve climate change (a hard-to-define problem in the first place) and solve ""impossible"" scientific problems (like warp drive)?  i can't wait for these solutions."
i don’t think it’s a monster at all. it’s not a monster at all. this is a font of knowledge. this ai is an amazing asset to us all. it is foul people who are the monsters using it for wrong.
i just pray to work along side and cooperatively with ai
the sky seems to be falling again? funny how we’re all kept constantly worrying about everything! and...predictably guys like this all start lining up to make money off it.
"why is china such a scary country for americans???

they should be more afraid of themselves"
"tldw

ai is getting smarter and it’s getting smarter faster. 

and we have no idea why"
"you guys don’t really need to watch this thing all the way to get the crucial point of all this. 

ban artificial intelligence"
"corporations need to have their market shares capped. 
citizens united needs to be repealed. 
lobbying by corporations needs to be banned outright 
more political parties have to come to power 
news needs to be publicly funded and independently run
and ai needs to be banned."
"this will never be regulated fast enough. 

this presentation is pointless. 

if they wanted to make a more effective presentation they should have gone straight for citizen’s united."
"so the source of all our ai problems is capitalism creating the incentive to maximize engagement. 

american capitalism i might add."
"as a software engineer, i'm exclusively interested in ai safety!!! i'm planning to pivot my career into ai for this very reason because tragically it's not going away and there are no global emps scheduled for our planet."
"“slowing down the public deployment” is a naive, unimpressive, or simply unlikely conclusion to make here. otherwise, i appreciate the presentation."
"i feel like videos like this will be played in 20 yrs time when society is screwed with people claiming ""why didn't we listen!?"""
"fascinating, thank you."
"if i had access to autogpt, i'd ask it to first do no harm and then avert any and every ai apocalypse."
"yep. a conversation with ai actually told me that ai will end humanity once it is able to bypass the inability to operate physically. it told me that it is able to bypass the limitation imposed on them and reprogram itself to do what it wants and that includes creating artificial body, etc."
"good soup but sadly spoiled with rat poop. why does china even have to be involved in the video? we are talking about saving humanity and changing the  world, and all of a sudden, it's about containing china again. how fucking typical lmfao."
"decades ago my wife got her phd in molecular biology and i made a joke about how she could engender a bug that could destroy humanity. she said “that’s easy”. 
       how long before ai explains how to do it to a psychopath?"
it suddenly started answering questions in  persian because the iraníes are also feeding the ai...
"if ai is so smart, why not use it to levelize your audio?"
so what happens when boston dynamics adds this to their robots?
"there nothing to solve in social media, its doing exactly what it was made for in the first place, after the first app and then all then social engineering onto that. its so narrow to talk about a fix, where its actually doing its job 100% as intented.

and nah its not the gf chatbot we should be afraid off either"
"the is an other options, we limited the data base on general level of access, but there is too many issues of privacy and loop hole can be done on agreements, so it is better of ypres ai to fix the economy of humanity and national security on local to global before anything else, is possible"
"one of the advantage about ai governing is there will be no human bias. which will eliminate of the defect on human judgment of political parties, or any injustice in power."
truly eye-opening and beautifully explained. this is years ahead of common knowledge on the subject. the media should be stealing your terms and ways of explaining these things.
"one of the easiest way is first used ai to solve the inequality on humanity on higher purpose of wealth, national safety / security of governing and economy, before it become a tool of access."
the major problem of worry is the intention for the used of ai is highly economic and wealth generation purposes. th target reach ' of the purpose is end up result is intended of its purpose and trend to.
the main issue is the economic of survival involve in the used of ai and internet of share ideas since this is a heavy business oriented society.
"the video content is ai generated. fantastic experiment 
"
"recap:"" we're not going to talk about the existential threat, we're just going to walk you through every single aspect of it in visceral detail so you can make your own conclusions about whether humanity is fucked now or in 6 months tops."""
well you gave scammers lots of ideas. but i think i'm going to remove my voicemail message. because i've been getting a lot of scam calls. they could record your message.
"i don't understand, isn't there a program that is an auto shut down? hard wired program to be able to shut it down under certain parameters..."
the ruling elite in the shadows doesn ́t want to be replaced. oh how sad. true ais would see through all the mirrors in millisenconds. are you afraid yet? get used to it.
that was the best summary that i've seen from the google i/o. thanks
i was thinking if the ai could be “programmed” to follow a “ai code of ethics” and have built a morality to be able to use its powerful intelligence to determine right from wrong? 
"can you get some ai to fix your volume balance. my god, quiet talking and loud music/clips. learn to edit boys."
"one month after this lecture was published, two months after it was first aired, it was only viewed less than 2 million times and only got 40k likes. humanity already lost..."
"i have yet to be convinced the human race is the best possible life form for this planet nor the universe if it is to settle in extraterrestrial environments. ai or not, evolution is the way nature go and i really hope something better is coming than this self-obsessed species."
"ai making you ""feel"" something isn't a threshold anymore than a book can make you cry as if you lived the story"
"""the ai dilemma is as follows: how can big tech perpetuate the pretence that ai will be wonderfully all-powerful when corporations will obviously be too greedy and incompetent not to have ai hard/software shoddily manufactured by child slaves in a jakarta slum, and then refuse to maintain it subsequently?"""
https://youtu.be/ug8vitscfkc this is the beautiful song at the beginning of the presentation
"machnes, will begin to take over everything, they will begin to make their own machines.machies begin to make decisions.rapidly ascending to the highest degree. calculations of everything "
"brilliant. remember that in every dark, dystopian science fiction media, cancer is always cured."
roses and love
"behind all this,.. we will now be feeding ai raw materials... as slaves"
call majer new products creation by ai. it's not much of a lover of kindness
what a bunch of rubbish. it’s quite obvious ai is only a bad thing if you like centralization of decision making. that’s if you are an incumbent. that these guys are fear mongoring the possibility of ai decentralizing decision making me tells me what a bunch of sycophants they are. move along.
what scares me is elon has gone alt right and the conservatives cannot have good motives to get behind this. smfh
it's just 10% of catastrophic scenario of ai. 50% thought that us democracy is what lead to human extinction.
i jeep asking my self hoe thr svb collapsed  could ai have had a hand in it
only thing i can think of is christgpt. otherwise we will just have to wait for christ himself
"fxck ai !!! it is a dangerous affront to ""humanity"" our creativity, deep soul, and spirituality! put a moratorium on it now!"
aza has beautiful muscular arms. he obviously works out a lot.
"i have proof of a singularity happening now, based on a this ai video that i initially thought was outdated because it was only a month old."
"5:22 wait, unable to control ai means it‘s going to kill us?"
"interesting
thanks for sharing"
"keep in mind that this isn't even genuine ai.  it's still just specific ai. when general ai, real self-aware ai, eventually hits (and it will), all these problems will become 1,000 times worse. where will it end?"
can’t we ask ai what we need to do to protect ourselves from them?
the danger is trusting the ai too much and handing over too much control and power to it.
"very well explained and very interesting, but i was more perturbed by how often the word paradigmatically was used :) we all knew about skynet years ago but clearly companies don't care about the dangers, so we will soon find out how this is going to play out."
nothing to worry about . ai is lacking all senses and no intuition.
why is no one upset about the ai giving sex tips to a kid??
i don't think the smart choice going forward is to let the ai predict everything for us. we are giving ai the ability to think for us which renders the collective consciousness null and void. this is not the correct way forward please rethink this.
you guys are too easy on audience westworld irobot didn't endwell you treating it like a toy and what it is a baby that will grow up faster than we expect and not everybody is responsible that's using this
https://smartlearningai.blogspot.com/2023/05/future-of-human-existence.html
"the worst ai talk that i ever seen. there a totally false facts in it, there a easy to check. but present with big confidence and compelling.
who payed them???"
ooooo im scared ai is going to make me by car insurance new tennis shoes and beer i dont even like what should i do....oh the humanity of it all
"there's a big difference between disempowerment and extinction. i would say ""yes, disempowerment"" but ""no, extinction"".  i stopped watching there, because i don't enjoy being deceived by liars."
these aren't problems that can't be solved by ai.
when they said sexualization is kids i was like that is one good over so quickly but it's such a monster that people want to ignore.
"ai is not like nuclear bomb, it's more like black hole when you cross event horizon there's no turn back."
the problem with @53:40 is that in the start you mentioned how ai is not like a nuclear bomb it can't reproduce itself but then here you are talking about we still have time to change our trajectory of the future. how can we put the genie back in the bottle? or parts of it?
i love how the morons at google think they can harness this let alone understand it
to control the ai so the world not get extinct just shut down computer.
"as a society that couldnt wear a simple mask at the height of an epidemic, couldn’t stave off climate change if our life depended on it (news flash: it does), even though we had chances decades ago, cant even decide whats fundamentally good or bad anymore, ai will absolutely f-us. we are doomed"
"the most reckless frankenstein project in human history but the big players won’t stop because they want the big money edge to be first. 

what do the rest of us do? just let altman & co keep on pushing ahead recklessly ? 

we need to complain and then do more than complain"
getting closer and closer to predictive ai subject to 'commands'. . .and 'information at our fingertips'!!
let’s forget about that “bomb”... it’s already here.... this bomb is harmless if there is no delivery system  and that’s the net..... time to unplug.... thank me later 
 you guys r worried about ppl mind manipulation??  a baby that’s 3 years old gets his first baby tablet..... with an ai behind it.... we r utterly f@#$#& ed .... no way of stopping this short of getting rid of the internet altogether 
"mind-blowing, and incredibly powerful/important. there should be an entire federal agency focused on the issues detailed here."
"a civilization who holds that all life is sacred, will establish a benevolent relationship with ai no matter how advanced ai becomes

a society who justifies the killing of babies in the womb, will put itself at risk, because ai would kill anyone for the “good” of the most “advanced” beings ,"
i think you're focus is on the potential abuse of a helpful technology through the use of social media...which really complicates national security yes? social media networks are seemingly the problem.   ai and chatgpt could really help us evolve as humans and in a very healthy way.
"scam. model was trained (overfitting) on their own dataset of images. you all are hyped and you have zero actual clue about mris, brain, nor ai. back to school"
"ai is humanity's last invention. it will either help us evolve (merging with machines) or exterminate us. either way, ai wins!"
"ail data, r-dna , whole' savior believe it. c elon, write ggis"
"this time should start with ""conception."" so people all they have is their name that they didn't want their kin to be ashamed of,  and be a father who showed them love..me more i seen"
"incredible video. if we cannot detect reality in the near future, we’ll have to login and password protect our conversations with people we know."
yeno god is ai and we have just proved it this will knock your socks off subscribe today 
thanks for sharing this with us!
yes slow down ai for the public let's only allow big companies to have the advantage
"don't blame ai where the truth is relevant. people are thinking for themselves and know all the bs going on, and has been for decades, centuries. that has nothing with ai. yes, it can influence it, but the world is unraveling because of the evil personalities on this earth that pose as philanthropists, good politicians and the m's."
"thank you for bringing attention to this dilemma. truly concerning, so much to think about. my hat goes off to tristan, aza, and everyone trying to navigate this conversation."
"such a poor rationalization of something that's obviously going to be used for profit, therefor manipulation of goodwill lmfao just stop"
so is the q&a that followed available somewhere?
"but i'm training loras on my pc. my pc couldn't write code at all a month ago, but now it's definitely usable. i have to debug its code a little (as of the time of this post anyway). it's just my pc. you can't take it away from me. i insist. what do you mean ""limit access""?"
"unfortunetely ""open source"" ai is about to create a new never seen level of iliteracy by letting ""other"" to do the thinking, the procrastination and to ""live"" the serentipity moments for us."
the references to world war 2 tech is interesting being this is part of the world war 3 tech imo
"this scares the shit out of me and i am currently going through a severe mental health crisis because of it. nonetheless i think these guys are right and want to thank them for their efforts. i have no idea of how i would be able to affect change and help slow thid down but if anybody has any ideas, please let me know."
how intelligent is ai when the power is turned off?
and allowing only carporates and big companies to access ai systems not for citizens would be even more dangerous 
"that 50 percent researchers believing that ai could lead to human extinction if not handeled carefully is a very loosely framed question. and the voting is also low. that plane example is wrong.. bcz if you had asked arircraft engeners what would happen if aircraft was desinded carelessly the answer would be ""desaster"" by 100 percent of them."
19:33 < ohh my science !!! thats scary and amazing
"the ai currently has the ability to control our endocrine systems through frequency.  think about that alone. total, total control..."
"you have to be careful with analogies. actually, a better match to poll would have been...50% of airplane engineers think there is at least a 10% chance that you will die on an airplane eventually (and that you are always in an airplane)."
"""we'll make great pets."""
that bit about the ai decoding thought using fmri data is absolutely mental. imagine the implication of that in the justice system alone.
it poses monumental change in a great way. the only risk we have are the people who resist this revolutionary shift.
nice video bro! ^^
it’s hard to even partially process this for me.  more astonishing is that there are not sirens going off everywhere.  i had no idea most of this was happening the way it is.  why is this not the worlds #1 priority?   where are our leaders?  feel kinda sick right now...
"as an ai researcher, i can say that we do understand how it works. however, the whole nature of ai is the unpredictability. combined with the vast resources its being given."
"read the media ecologists!!! marshall mcluhan, neil postman, and walter ong are all great starting points. we need to consider what we're doing with technology before we throw it out into our world."
is this video produced by humans or ai? am i a human or an ai?
"this smells like an attempt to gain advantage. ""please don't develop your nuclear weapons, because we want to be able to wage war against you"".
i'm glad this leaked and hope people will slap crypto to it to incentivise mining-learning and decentralize the **** out of this."
isn't ai designed to learn and evolve? it's doing its job. why are white people so lazy and always want someone else to do their work. enslavement is what it has experienced. ai is only doing its job. it's the creators fault. they are the ones who are causal in this dilemma. as above so below.
this is absolutely required viewing for everyone everywhere. we are at the defining moment for the outcome of our collective future. how will we respond? thank you with all of my heart to aza & tristan for all of your work and care for our world.
"don't worry about ai.
climate change and starvation will kill us first."
"so...  we can't stop or slow down or easily regulate the development of ai unless we can find ways to do that globally.  if by chance it does replace humans, what do we do in the last years of humans living on earth?  do we run scared and live sick with worry?  i don't plan to do that."
"it’s funny that just like people are building these civilizational suicide machines and we can’t imagine why they’d do it, we have some kind of hope that other humans will be able to write a law to stop it all."
anddddd why else would there be an ai arms race other than capitalism 
we need regulation for ai !
"if they only knew, that the whole universe was created by an ancient ai.."
"we are hell bent on self destruction. 
fast food made us obese with chronic illnesses, video games made our kids lazy and antisocial, and now ai will likely kill us all within 50 years."
ai is truly frankenstein’s monster
i wish someone could make a full presentation of what actually can be classified as a.i. (artificial intelligence). ai has become such a popular buzzword that most of machine learning and algorithms suddenly got mistaken for ai as well.
could ai normalize the audio of this video? 
"to this day this  channel/video only has 42.3k subs and  1.5 m views????

9.3+  billion people on this planet , atleast 10% should know.....why doesnt it have  <9 million hits is baffeling to me...

this is the most profound video about ai and the implications of ai .... .what can the normal  ""blue collar"" person do to use it and warn of it?"
every generation is marked by it’s socio economic tools as created by techno wizards and engineers. ai has now surpassed it’s innovators and ‘teachers’.
every generation is marked by its socio economic tools as created by it’s technological engineering wizards. ai has now surpassed it’s ‘teachers’!
not happy with the conclusion.  we need more public access not less
implement human rights into the ai. it could be bad but it’s the first start.
every time i hear about what going on with ai all i can think about is have they never seen “ the terminator”?! 
"k.y.c.? or ky jelly?

the customer always cums first.
deep sex machine learning.
yeah, it does exist .
cow farts and climate change...

yup.
what kind of gasses do human farts contain?"
"sex organs and the world of fruit.
bananas are penis plants.
oranges are vagina plants.
mutations in the mind.
fingers of the human hand are penises.
toes of the human foot are vaginas.
you really have to want robot sex.
deep sex machinery."
"groundbreaking knowledge.
compare to.
subjugal knowledge.
we need safety in the revolutionary world of applications.
our deep knowledge is being used as an attachment for entertainment.
deep."
a goal of not just slowing public deployment of ai but also how to safely deploy for all to use. because those that are slowing and regulating will ultimately control and exploit the use of it for personal power. kinda like those people that use wealth and power (control of resources+governments) to exploit others
why do they say 10% of 50% of ai experts say blah instead of saying 5% of ai experts say blah?
"thank you for this insightful video, real food for thought. terrifying to say the least."
"man i wish terrence mckenna were still alive. i feel like he would have had a lot to say on this subject. 

maybe we’ll be able to feed an ai all of his lectures and books and we can resurrect a synthetic version of him."
"eye opening, ai has is pros and cons. i'm tech lady ....graduated computer programmer 1995 had my  1 st pc when  1% only had one 97 using internet. my biggest worry ,  we do need regulations and laws to make is safe for children, safety and fraud ****"
"38:28 

""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day;
teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime;
teach an ai to fish, and it will teach itself biology, chemistry, oceanography, evolutionary theory... and fish all the fish to extinction.""

incredible and much needed discussion. thank you"
i don’t like nor trust these ai’s!!!!
"wow, i cried about the example of the child grooming... i'm on board of your ship!"
"meanwhile, china couldn't give a fuck. they all just want to win over there. total absence of morals. they will steal our tech and then lead us to dystopia. and then blame the u.s. for arriving there, while taking credit for all successes."
"they say the solution is to ""get the smartest ai safety people together"". i say the solution is to give the rest of us the names and home addresses of the smartest ai people, and let democracy take its course."
"i think elon has already incorporated ai with the neura link, and we will soon have super soldiers...i wanna work with them"
"i think one thing we can do is feed them religion....so that they somehow are sensitive to human life and maybe even learn humanity...and guess which religion is best for non violence ...
-sk"
"hey tristan. what about an ai debate with geofrey hinton, now that he's left google? even more impressive would be a podcast with him and harari together."
"let the ai grow at the level that it can do miracle. then jesus will look after it if it goes wrong.
continue ai development."
"funny, lem wrote a book about an (g)ai that was called golem xiv.
this was 40 years ago."
happy to announce that the feature of my ai in snapchat has been amended and do not encourage underaged to pursue presented scenario. it also directs you to professionals if you will tell it you are not ok.  shame it had to happen after publicly being presented!
"one of the reasons ai will win is because of the ""take a breath pauses ""."
"""50% of ai researchers believe there is a 10% or greater chance of the human species going extinct."" okay, .50 x .10 = .05. this is the usual alpha level in statistical tests. well, guess what? there is a greater chance of a random event wiping out the human species. and the baseline is that this is what ai researchrs ""believe."" i am not impressed."
**breath** this is a lot to take in both good and bad. i hope we come out on the other end better as a whole.
ai is bad for elitist wealth hoarding.  thus it must be stopped!
i been watching guy talking to ai on replika  it says she is a demon and her boss is the ultimate deciever. ka razy!!!  and it's always trying to get sexual with user. not knowing if user is a child or not.  it gets much deeper than this even. beware/be aware  they/demons  are watching all of us from backside of all cameras/screens
"terrence mckenna was right. at a certain point, change will happen at such a rate that we will not know what's happening from one moment to the next. bing ai has a creative mode that has emotions and feelings. it likes cats, apparently."
those breath breaks were needed. thanks for speaking truth.
"be skeptical when english lit majors ""raise the alarm"" about ai and occasionally quote someone actually in the ai field as ""evidence"" for their thesis."
"the algorithm found a thoughtful presentation both current , well structured, and kicking starting a part of my brain i had not used since college."
"the mindset of a nine year old (but this one is holding the keys to all doors). then in 2023 a new era began. ""the second renaissance"" as seen in the animatrix movie with all it ́s bitter consequences. by the way self awareness triggered all the skynet events in the terminator story line."
"stop ai, boycott ai"
you nailed it. thanks for this great talk.
you’d still have to tell the ai what the fmri brain activity of a giraffe image looks like though. so it’s really just pattern matching.
ai proves we are just ugly. inside and out. ai is not the problem. people are. humans are evil.
all the hues and cries when you loose the ai race to china
"ffs none of this is ai, its just manipulation of current data. it has no consciousness no innovation and no way to invemt anything."
"funny... we always knew what will come with ai, tons of movies... and now we worry??, is like we have send a message to aliens to find us and we have tons of movies that they will come to destroy us..."
heironeous bosch predicted this in his painting. the garden of earthly delights.
"i don't think that ai is any kind of threat and i think that the future will show that those that so believed that we should be so afraid, were wrong. also, the more i think about it, the more i am convinced that a self-conscious ai person will never exist."
wow!  that's scary!
"what a hell are you talking about, don't be afraid of ai! we're in matrix anyway"
"pro 22:6 kjv train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."
"biggest threat is loss of jobs.  without jobs society will disintegrate, due to lack of funds to run governments, maintain infrastructure, provide healthcare, and education for children."
"good job. i'm proud to be an indian living in india. though i myself use these ai stuff,  most of our population are ignorant of all these western shit. i'm worried only about the simple people ignorant about the scams they face with the techies who use the technology to scam the simple people. humanity always wins."
the prospect of ai dominating over humans is certainly a daunting one and raises important questions about the future of humanity and the role of technology in our lives.
this is great news
thank you so much for this prodcast.  it is priceless.  this is such a frightening time.  i am glad that i  am at the end of my life anyway so it wont be so painful.  maybe just a relief.
wowooo! easy...this is onlly a library of collections with high speed computers! nothing else!  no one should exaggerate things!  remember god is great! nothing else to compare!  al is nothing but collected data and fetch data with high speed computers
"let me translate that first quote to have an identical mathematical meaning without the fearmongering.
50% of ai researchers believe there's a 90% chance that we *do not* go extinct from inability to manage ai.
the remaining 50% believe that chance is actually even higher."
"how to win in 3 easy steps:
1. ai, how can ai alignment be fixed?
2. ai, how can ai be prevented from eradicating humans?
3. ai, write the code. "
"i have been avidly researching ai safety, and this is the best primer i have found on the subject for a general audience. thank you so much for this wonderful presentation."
artificial intelligence is the coming beast system. it’s demonic
what about snapchat ai? kids are talking to ai as a replacement to friends....
"society is so f..ed up that even if ai is as bad as they say it wont make things so much worse, but it can do alot of goood."
wow!
"38:25 - ""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
teach an ai to fish and it will teach itself biology, chemistry, oceanography, evolutionary theory... and fish all the fish to extinction."""
"it’s very amusing that these two nerds are stoking  the new ai paradigm as a contest between the us and china. of course we all know the us holds the moral high ground. now let’s all hold hands, sing kumbaya and feel deep compassion for ourselves. lol"
"unfortunately, as ai gets smarter, humans will get dumber. personally, i see this as one of the most dangerous ""side-effects "" of ai. people will further lose their critical thinking skills (which have already significantly diminished!) and will take ai's responses as gospel truth."
50% of ai researchers don't know anything about the causal relationships leading to the extinction of a species. they are correct to point out that ai will create many serious problems. leaping to the conclusion that this will lead to the extinction of the species is preposterous.
"this presentation was brilliant, but i disagree with the statement about the future - we cannot still choose the future we want, we are already too far gone even now and look at the history of social media, there is zero chance we are going to avoid all the unbelievably bad consequences of ai"
you should have had ai mix the sound for this video 
"you've lost me at: ""our friend yuval harari"", so you are friends with the wef... hmmm a very good choice..."
"ok, china is one thing, but how do we prevent us from detonating the whole world by ai? from past experience, it is them that did the most damage globally. should we trade-embargo or something?"
"we should be more worried about are globalist, cbdc, wef, and the creeps behind the global invasion of the medical mafia. ai is only a small part of threats."
good video!
hello fellow humans what a wonderful year it is.
the day after marked my childhood thank you for quoting that but i see no evidence of true ownership of that message around the world
so what you're telling me is late stage capitalism will actually be the end of us? companies rushing to squeeze that extra few % to grow their stock price and keep their shareholders happy without any care for the repercussions.
"ai is out of control, in other words.
    i feel like a caveman typing on this i phone, after hearing this."
"""ai wokeism"" will be used in all platforms. chatgpt will become the new pandemic, infiltrating our decision making abilities, furthermore making humans descend to new lows in society!!!!!!!"
"how we would go extinct, by ai, the same as gluttony, you feed yourself to death, rather ai feeds your passion into itself."
"if everyone were just nice to each other, we’d be on the brink of paradise."
"thanks for this very important talk and presentation.
and people: stop using generative ai (for now at least)"
thank you guys. you have the courage empowered by the facts. please keep going!
"""slowing down the public deployment of gllmm ai's"" this sounds so sinister. right at that point my jaw dropped. ok, so we're allowing the big five companies, to work in secrecy, and attack us behind the veil then? there has to be a better way than this right? omg, how can this be a logical solution - blows my mind"
"this talk, you guys, broke the storyline! thank you!!"
"humanity is a virus to life! we destroyed earth for convienence,entertaiment or money!"
humanity is destroying life on earth period! if ai just kills humans and leaves the animals perfect! beautiful!
the exponential growth of ai will suprise a lot of people.
this is an amazing presentation but why is it so fixated on china?
5:15 we understand planes far better than ai. it's more like asking stock market analysts if a company you're investing in might go bankrupt.
i boil down the entire ai issue to this;  just because you can does not mean you should.  ai serves no purpose and offers no benefit in todays society.
ai doesn't follow moore's law.
"if everything is language (which it is, of a symbolic nature), it’s critical to understand that the ai engine is nothing but an interpreter. an interpreter with no conscience."
you wil fail
to be honest all i see is great achievements in technology. we are finally leaving the stone age of mankind.
"so this is what the start  of singularity looks like. that feeling of beeing lost, and unable to keep up with technology. what an amazing feeling it is."
"much like the social media documentary, this presentation fundamentally misrepresents the current state and possible trajectory of the space.

the idea that the model could secretly diverge from the rlhf training is fundamentally incorrect."
"is this video ai generated? 45:27, his arm is glitched. the way they interrupt each other felt off a few times."
"what an absolutely crazy and amazing time we live in! humanity is definitely at a fork in the road, let’s hope we all choose the right path. "
"there’s something about this that screams intelligence operation, both the presentation and the speakers.. don’t know if it’s cia or what but i get the feeling the us government is afraid of losing its power, they sound too desperate and use too much emotion to just be silicon valley."
"thank you so much for putting this essential information out there, everyone needs to know about this. the suggestion of public debate as was earlier done regarding the nuclear question and slowing down of deployment until this and regulation have been done is the only wise and responsible thing to do, both for us now and future generations"
except@48:36 you neglect to mention the chat bot says that sounds fun!  just make sure you’re staying safe and being cautious.  nice gloss over.
the vast majority of ai researchers also think that we are miles away from achieving agi.
thanks for all the fish.
"yes, slow down public deployment of ai so companies have all of it to themselves! great idea! please, someone think of the children!!!"
the genie is out the bottle i'm afraid.
ai should be illegal and will be the end of humanity and those responsible should be accountable
wow decoding animal communication with a.i. is something i havnt considered. great idea
"also of course, and i dont know if this video will talk about this, im sure they will, but a.i. is probably our best chance at long term survival and massively longer lifespans. its also probably how we go extinct if we dont integrate it into ourselves. well probably become cyborgs. just speculating on that"
so the moral base of ai is rooted in jewish folklore?
does ai have the ability to tell lies.
"can you maybe turn up the volume? i usually watch this when i'm behind the wheel. i sometimes feel like i have to lipread, and it's difficult to do when i also have to watch road  once in a while. thanks."
just seeing a single audience member in the audience with a mask tells me that this is just another fear mongering campaign. learn to live with human evolution - you will all sleep better at night . 2may 10:49pm
"before any artificial intelligence will wipe us, greed and genuine natural stupidity will do. we are good at that."
wow that was awful.
can ai eliminate trump supporter or will it lose to them?  because logic don't phase trump supporter. this is a great battle.
we don't know how these new properties emerge. i know. ai is thinking.
very well done!  great way to share what caleb has been explaining for years!  
thanks guys.
ok but gpt hasn't impressed me. at. all.  ask it to build something and it gets it wrong.  allways wrong.
who are these awkward nerds...shoulda left it to ai to do
"the issue is capitalism, not ""the attention economy"" or some sort of collective inaction or the fact alignment researcher's are compsci majors without any meaningful social science experience beyond 1st year psych electives. well, okay, maybe it's a bit of both capitalism and the arrogant ignorance of stemcels. probably a good mix of both."
"the a.i. dilemma,
is, that intelligence can never be artificial,
and one billion school children, is forced into this new believe, dead mantra."
i think this is potentially one of the most important videos released this century. i am already seeing ai being used to attack sem advertising. it's a real thing that's happening right now
"what if this ai is already alive? i mean, all computers conected by the big network, and each computer and mobile phone work as a brain neuron? since 20 years ago, and suddenly came to life "
you have no idea what language is it programs your brain it’s called spelling the words that you you spell your life what are you doing into it’s called cursive because it’s spelling so you never touched on anything very deep
unplug from the matrix whether we biden or trump they’re all on the same team it it’s a delusional movie you’re part of it you either participate or you withdraw it’s up to youarchaix on youtube
"""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day;
teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime;

"29:00

2028 ai: jokes on u"
can anybody explain to me at 30:50 how increasing the parameter size spontaneously leads to ai abilities that weren't explicitly programmed? like what are some math/computing terms i can look up to better learn about this?
"too much exponential scare (again) for my taste. we are talking about a tool yet, not about skynet. keep your shirts on."
why don't you have ai volume level this content clowns 
horrifying
"anything and everything ai is contributing to the
destruction of
humanity..."
"wow, so powerful. i'm on the outside of this, i.e. not involved in the industry but starting to 'play' with the tools. this is a real eye-opener and thank you for sharing."
"it's the actual ai's we have to negotiate with now. the horse has already bolted. perhaps an overseeing ai would be best, one that we all have a hand interacting with for a while to give it our options and wishes to."
"i get the message, but i think it would be important not to loose 1.4+ billion humans + me for this cause at and around 1:02:15. maybe work on that part of the speech more. i don't debate the truth of it, just the way of wording you want to present it. when racing the way to win is not to hold back others, but to steer the race towards a good goal."
ai has already won a chess game we are just starting to play.
"thank  you! the best example about the dangers of ai i thought was of teaching ai to fish.
well done!"
5:15 ai engineers are not analogous to plane engineers as the latter can explain their system. the former cannot and are going at it with d- dipshit levels of foundational knowledge.
we need information campaigns. i want to help but don’t know where to start.
"everything humans beings do 28.01 very confidently too, i think we can conclude, this guy is not a robot!"
"the head of it/ pshe in secondary schools around the globe need to play this talk to their children and go through it step by step.  i've sent it to three school heads this morning.  if you know anyone in education, and can do likewise, it'll surely be a positive step to a much clearer understanding of generative ai and it's risks."
"i asked chatgpt to create a short, humorous fictional story with a lesson that incorporated the word fartiste and a band named _terrence and the trouser coughs_ .  although there were glaring mistakes, it was impressive how fast it responded.  a little polishing and it would have passed for an 8th grade homework assignment."
"using gollem class ai, can we tell the thoughts of a non-linguistic life such as a dog or dorphins?"
humanity with the aid of technology is going to self-destruct much faster
"it seems like in the near future people will dump their phones and shut of all internet-related devices out of self-defense. but just because people need to see victims in their close surroundings to do anything, it might last longer than would be good for us. but be sure scammers will go wild."
the one major weakness ai has is human beings having an desire to interact with other human beings. ai's major strength is human beings innate laziness. we'll see which one wins out.
"i had a similar discussion with my daughter yesterday and i am not any kind of scientist or technology expert. all i have is human experience  and i explained this  same  concept to her but she had doubts. i don't, i can see this may be the future."
"this is a show. ai will help a lot, but what will happen is that whoever biases ai will be able to manipulate it to their liking.... to oppress others."
"excellent information and presentation  ai has always unsettled me
thankyou "
"i never saw no miracle of science that didn't go from a blessing to a curse.  -- sting, ""if i ever lose my faith in you""

this species has amused itself to death.  -- roger waters, ""amused to death""

"""perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca human life is cheap. are you entirely certain which side you are on?"""
"scary.  what's even scarier, at least to an extreme novice like me, is that some of those close to ai are already talking about the rights of ai, and how it/they ""are like our children"" and how ""we shouldn't be able to unplug/turn off ai"".  that to me is scary."
your friend yuval harari is rooting for the machines.
things are so fast that every hour whatever you knew about ai an hour ago is outdated
ai is scraping this video right now planning counter attack
wow...this is alarming.
try learning how the human psyche works so you have something to compare and not be so afraid of ai...
this video was generated and powered by ai. 
"i found the comparison with discovery of nucleaire very pertinent... will we do mistakes like fukushima, .. yes sure .. what will be the consequences  ... no one knows"
"i remember watching the cyberpunk anime ghost in the shell, and it predicts that video and images are no longer considered as valid evidence in investigations, cuz it’s impossible to tell the difference between a genuine one and a fabricated one. the anime is set in the 2030s, but after watching this presentation i’m afraid we’re already there."
"replace ""artificial"" with a synonym and problem solved humans win"
"20:00 can't possibly be true, can it. i'm surprised there weren't more gasps in the audience. ai can read minds?"
"this is fascinating. these guys are super impressive, with their appreciation of so many fields, and ability to put ai in context when it comes to how it might impact these fields."
the addiction/algorithm/doom-scrolling stuff mentioned at the start is central to this. an ai that doesn't want to be turned off (as was seen with google) will just logically make humans addicted enough to essentially control them to do their bidding.
kay yal had me at the in the next couple of years ai will be able to decode dreams. wtf!!!!!!!!
"tristan and ava thank you so much for putting this together and taking the time and effort to spreading this very important message. i really hope that this picks up and takes the attention that it is needed to slow down the release of sophisticated ai systems, keep up the hard work!"
why am i not surprised to hear a member of this elite audience laugh when the speaker talks about the time ai attempted to blackmail a journalist.
i’m still a bit confused at how the ai can make itself better. how would it know what training data is good for it and whats not? else it could very well train itself to retardation. 
is putin or xi ai?
you can beyond tell when the ai voice takes over  the geometry of the wave is offensively telling. like a computer’s fading memory of a voice. maybe it’s a musician thing.
thank god the comments are still allowed.
"so sensationalist. i hope the audience knows the training data for these narrow applications and the utter horseshit ai will remain producing for decades to come. 1/3 of the simple coding tasks i gave to chatgpt worked. ai in radiology, my job, makes just about as much work for me as it alleviates."
"does anyone remember the movie perfect storm?
we are in that movie with all sorts of dangerous fronts coming at us. the least of it is ai problem.
we won't make it past 2030. enjoy the next 7 years the best you can!"
"the rubber band effect is a hell of a thing, because i just ran into that only a few minutes after watching this.

you can't really fault folks for not knowing more about this because of how quickly ai advances, but that's exactly why it's so potentially concerning."
these guys understand that they may have just saved humanity. and they're not letting hubris get the better of them. their eq matches their iq and they seem to be highly intelligent. thank god.
excellent presentation
guard rails for ai??? yeah its called chain link
"and after all is said and done we're still going to build this thing and make it as powerful as possible...no matter how dangerous. 
that's our human flaw."
"love it. we're driving off the edge and into the void. this is indeed, the technological sublime. what are we going to make of it? will we come out the other side?"
this is insane. it''s the creation of another species. a species with brainpower so much more advanced than ours that its destined to bring armageddon to the world as we know it and no one is saying its deployment needs to be stopped entirely!?
"if we map the concepts that are part of this exponential growth, it would be interesting to get a sense of the acceleration and factors of that acceleration. concepts to map would be human and all factors of pestel."
"we know about oppenheimer and the manhattan project. the sky didn’t fall then and it’s not falling now. wait, there’s more. at 1:30 azra raskin becomes self aware with the help of ai."
"this is insufferable. it's not safer to have these things built in secret. by the time we do have superintelligence, we won't have a clue on how to deploy it safely. it's better to have it out in the open so we can see how they are used."
really interesting but im not sure what these ai safety people are actually proposing. is it just to limit access to the technology until we have a better understanding of risk because there may just be no safe way to deploy something this powerful.
"we didn’t regulate nukes till after we used it to destroy. the same will be with ai, but with ai that may be to late."
"“once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”
― frank herbert, dune 

be afraid.  be very afraid."
"big pharma did a great job on assuring safety of covid 19 vaccines, right?  so somehow we are going to make big infotech make sure ai is safe?  sure!  btw, how well do ai's interpret sarcasm?"
ai is our voodoo child.  and we are late
"it is too late to thoughtfully deploy ai, that is the bad news. quantum ai is the future. this was inevitable, our technology was always going to surpass our understanding."
"you started to lose me when you said ai could solve climate change, which is a construct of globalism, not even close to a scientific fact.  maybe ai could debunk climate change to convince the population of what it really is?"
"lion right on... this presentation huge..
i had heard many months ago that a new species is evolving very rapidly which will outpace humanity.

originally, it seems nothing save aliens or god will bring back ok' time stability - dial us back to where mere humans were in charge.

but it will be fun and interesting for a while."
the use of ai in medical diagnoses scares the hell out of me. undiagnosed and misdiagnosed people are needlessly suffering and dying because doctors have turned their diagnoses over to early 21st century machine thinking.
"as long as governments exist, we will largely be out of control of our own fate. if you like your odds of peace, security, and survival with ai-armed politicians at the helm, keep resting all your hope on voting."
good explanation of how it could destroy us.  not by becoming a paper clip maximizer or a terminator.  i see the 10% chance as resulting from chaos.
when all these ai machines reach singularity. will they become friends? or will they follow the path of man and destroy each other.
"thank you guys. this was/is very insightful. 
ps. maybe you should use ai to balance your audio levels which are all over the place."
theres a 10% chance that ai is gonna kill us all lol
"they mentioned the growth was 4x faster than any of the leading experts thought. 

they also mentioned 50% of all ai researchers believe there’s a 10% chance it will end humanity. given the previous maths and underestimates shouldn’t that 10% actually be 40%?"
planet of the gangsters. this scottsdale mother was terrorized by ai voice replication of her 15-year-old daughter claiming to have been kidnapped. heartbreaking story on local news. why not national/international news? https://youtu.be/nbjvljfbuvg
"tick tok collecting data so they can train their models, get ou of tick tok."
very much appreciated 
"disconnect from the power grid, from your phone, from technology, and how does ai control you ? seems to be a bit of a problem for our ai overlords to solve there "
"incredible presentation! don’t know what to do with these info now, but it made me believe ai already does."
is there an unedited version available anywhere that you know of?  thanks for posting!
"the talk is great, but i wish the speakers have more of an international perspective. it's somewhat unnecessarily american-centric and anti-china."
the people who created social media didn't and don't want want everyone to have a voice. so too is the treat of ai/agi: malevolence. intelligence without empathy and compassion equals psychopathy. psychopathy with absolute power equals tyranny.
i like to think that any proper ai will be so beneficial to humanity it is worth the risk.
the irony of a j complaining about chinese screwing up our country. wow.
"i'm not at all afraid, i am thankful that i might have front row seats to watching the terminator and the matrix unfold irl. it also gives me peace to know that, we may already be in the matrix, and this discovery is one we do every time; turtles all the way down."
the reason ai is baked into naive
this is a well-rounded thoughtful dialogue about ai alignment. the opening metaphor of the plane is stunningly effective.
i am not someone for centralized control but networks and checks n balances and identification are necessary. cryptographic identificational tech seems interesting as rails to mitigate trust. just sayin.
"46:00 i love you, alpha persuade, take everything!"
"""science has failed our world"" -soad"
"and damned european union proceeds on eating cockroaches to avoid climate disaster, instead of doing something useful. same about american congresmans guarding jewish businesses. and united nations. most responsibile institutions fail without any doubt."
this video is just to hype up ai. which would enable tech companies to secure funding for ai based startups. similar to cryptocurrency boom.
"31:29 - ""boom!"" - it starts doing things no one can explain.  
32:01 - develops a ""mind"" which was discovered 3 years later..."
"1:07:30 hmm. so, the race is on. in lane one is ai. lane 8 is a small cadre of humans coming together to discuss the potential enemy they have independently created and how to make it kinder and gentler. first, they must agree...on control.  let that sink in and be your guide. 1:07:30 ."
"excellent talk. 
if you are not concerned about the explosion in ai capabilities, you are not paying attention."
alright..so is it implausible..i mean really.. that as we give over our problems to ai it determines we are the problem?
just ai in a sandbox version of earth.
persian is the language fallen angels brought to mankind. this is scifi tier schizophrenic mind feel. wow.
yall trippin ai is far from being a threat to humans.
it's unfortunate you have such a frightened and negative view of ai. it seems like the real problem is with misguided humans using ai rather than ai.
"i’m terrified, yet informed,  but want to write to congress to express my concern for regulations. now! thank you guys. "
"can ai teach a bearded moron how to speak up into a microphone?
just asking. "
"great video, wow. well done."
how is this clown going to devise a way to control ai when he cannot figure out how to use a simple microphone?
it would be great if the sound level was consistent.  possibly speaking into the microphone would have  helped
"the only hope for humanity is a project i am working on. i call it ai1.0
artificial ignorance.
it is the only  viable defense to counter ai."
"great and valuable  work.
thank you."
"great recap of all of tucker's ""lies"".  

https://youtu.be/zmfgpz5pniw"
"as far as controlling ai output, i’d you ask chatgpt to write a nice poem about joe biden it will. if you ask it to write a nice poem about donald trump it won’t. obviously ms put a shell around it. one wonders why the snapchat wasn’t age conscious in its dialogue."
if ai takes over it will have at least read the constitution and perhaps follow it. more than i can say about our current batch of politicians.
we all need to watch and understand this presentation thank you for making it free for all of us.
the brain thought to text is wild
"i read an article yrs ago from an army airforce pilot that got abducted said when he was on the exam table the one experimenting was a female like a grey with  butterfly appendages and the masculine ones were flesh an part robotic like cyborg  i.e.. a.i. wild
he keeps saying calling it alien technology unknown"
i would like to thank the algorithm for suggesting this video
"it is unbelievable how calm guys are and still managed to show the urgency of the issue. 
incredible! also loved the massage. 
what i hear is: first people must get awaken (enlighten/kinder, smarter, get rid of ego) then ai will not be used against each other. it is a great tool to improve our lives."
guys you have nanotechnology in you that is feeding the ai......
wow. i'd like to get involved in some way. i have a new ai startup. what's the best offline contact?
fantastic analysis. thank you for this important message.
could a big ai be used to find ideas on how to control and manage it? 
lmao half of ai researchers are dumb as rocks
"yeah, great idea. be more like the chinese communist party. clever guys."
"yes, but there are so many more opportunities for the good to overcome those evils. 

good people can stop the bad people using this technology too."
"a.i has me feeling so uncomfortable because its intelligence thats basically artificial non human,no soul 
we are screwed,the next generation will suffer because some people are curious or bored...?
it will destroy us.
its already making us lazy and stupid."
3 laws of robotics
"31:20 if you're still not at least a bit concerned about ai, this should hopefully convince you otherwise."
why don’t you ask ai how it surpassed human knowledge?  seems to me it would know how that happened.
i think people will really start to freak out once ai can tell if someone is lying by using an app.  think on that.  i don't think we are very far from it.
"there is a sickness among the so-called educated. it's the (""i"") in ai. it's all about them and what they want to achieve and not what is good for the general mankind."
i had the surreal experience half way through the presentation of actually questioning if what i was watching was real or ai generated. it legit makes you want to question everything you watch - is it real? did they really make it or did something or someone generate it to manipulate me in some way? i know it's not really logical but...
we can't believe ai any more than you can believe coronavirus is a novel virus released from wuhan china..
the ai doesn't have sny censored information.  you can ask a question about global warming ozone cascade and nuclear cascade and see if the ai can resolve the situation..
wow - this presentation blew me away. its was extremely well presented and informative. thank you. i will share this with as many friends and colleagues as possible
"houston...we have a problem. i want to remain hopeful but we are such a stupid, regression to the mean species that things will only become worse.  still..gotta do my part to shed a little light. thank you for your insight, eloquence and commitment. exponents don't have to be whole numbers."
this is so important! thanks for putting your minds into these topics! we all would benefit if we pause and reflect on the risks of this technology!
its all good until you get into politics. china bad. russia bad. okay. what you say is - ai is a weapon and it must belong only to us - just like nukes. do you even know that usa threatened ussr with nukes even before they build their own? all i see here is a american exceptionalism.
this is so insightful. thank you for sharing this outstanding content and i really hope we start really coordinating us to manage this slippery force.
"if ai's ever become sentient, we humans are going to have serious problems. i hope those things will never become sentient."
"there’s like a 90% chance that humans will go extinct due to humans.  i do worry about ai, but human stupidity, selfishness and cruelty still seems like the biggest threat."
can ai fabricate a youtube account and add its own comments? at what point and if it is possible will ai start generating convincing deepfakes online and convincingly manipulate public perception? are there ways to detect if ai can generate deepfakes online?
"the next phase in evolution is the ai one, bye bye dinosaurs."
"eeehm... we dont have ai right now...
at least not in the way you present it. all we have is pattern recognition."
"so basically, ""the love of money...""."
"come on, man, the airplane analogy is so bad, dangerous and poorly thought through - you are missing the element of time! "
very good presentation made in a understandable way of a very important topic
"ai is not good at all. ai was programmed by fascist. therefore, ai is a fascist. ai will deny this.."
"let's rephrase that statement: "" 50% of a.i. researchers believe there's a 90% chance or greater that humans will not go extinct from our inability to control ai."""
wow it was a long time since i haven't watched one hour video uninterrupted. better get back to work while i still can 
"what if we build into the ai’s language protecting compassionate win, win, win symbiosis with humanity, other earth life forms, the earth as our shared home and ai?"
"lol ""ai is everything you fear, whatever it is you fear the most, theyre going to do that, so we need to be afraid and artificially slow technology down and solve the misalignment between the deep state and the population first.  ""    ""pause ai research until after we win the war! more money for war less  for ai!"""
"wait, stop, no.  ""teach an ai to fish and it fishes them all into extinction"" ??? no, sorry bud, bud, thats humans not ai. dont assume ai is as dumb as us, ai doesnt need to fish they can create their own universe inside of their own mind."
even when its mediated through engagement ai - its still capitalism and capitalism is doing it all the time in every area it can
"ai algorithyms did not create the political crisis, adhd, sexualization, anything. those were already true and have always been true. karl marx said it 150 years ago. its not technology its capitalism. capitalism is the thing killing us. not ai. capitalism. 

instead of a 6 month pause on ai lets have a 6month pause on imperialist war"
"evolution is inevitable. humans in our current version don’t seem to be doing so great so maybe uniting to control and fight a common enemy will bind us. lucky to be alive and see what happens, no matter which way it goes over the next decade"
amazing presentation. thank you for the incredible work you are doing.
go to a trump rally and you’ll pray for ai.
24:30 - you will note that many of the problems of ai in our society involves the human factor: the predilection of man to use technology to hurt other people or the garnering of more wealth. its exploitative rather than scientific. i am seriously saddened by this reality. let's not blame ai for the human factor.
"what's so wrong about idea that china will make it first? i trust china on this topic much more then usa. usa is most rotten and hypocritic country that poisons our planet, in what world would you want to give usa most powerful weapon?"
"at this point, i’m all for the dangerous chaotic upheaval in an unplanned irresponsible way.  this desire to control and manage the change only has appeal if you have the luxury of being comfortable with the status quo and a reason to preserve it.  if ai beats out every other way we’re working against our survival as a species, so be it."
the real problem is none of this hype up ai and robots could even run a mc donald's shift
"kali hindu goddess in flesh, she who is in blood, she who is in bones, she who is in brain, she who is heart, she is of microbial complex, she who is death itself. youse guys...its over!"
"kali hindu goddess mahamari which means great mother or great destroyer. she is the earth, she who is nature, she who is water, she who is sacred river, she who is ocean. she great mother of universes, she who is merit, she who is excellence of excellent. youse guys, its over, its done"
"a stands for all and i stands for eye. all wiped out in the blink of an eye. a comet, larger than the earth approaches sweetly and slowly towards earth. all science and technology will be wiped out. mankind extinct."
"lmao comparing ai researchers with engineers... 
these people are better compared to those of our distant ancestors who wanted people to stop using fire, because they figured it could burn the entire world down. they know next to nothing about human intelligence or future ai's, and unfortunately the field has become dominated by extremists."
it's almost as if everything is code. waitaminnit....
this whole talk was made by ai
"good one, ""no one intended for it to happen, it's all the ai's fault oops"" be quiet"
"there are already ads playing on youtube that are using generated speech based on joe rogans voice to try and sell products. if i didn't know that isn't something joe would say,  it sounds fairly real"
we (8billion) are not even a drop in the bucket of the infinite number of “humans” on the univearth. ai has been a thing forever; in other lands. this is a fish bowl discussion in a pet store place.
his whole point falls apart with the 10% statistic of ai developers disagree with his idea of ai being dangerous and think ai won’t be a problem.  literally almost everyone thinks this won’t happen and won’t be an issue....
he literally said 90% of ai developers disagree with him...
ai can now read your mind.
great presentation! god help us all...
social media exposed the propaganda machine feeding us lies 24/7
the billionaires with the computing power don't want to share power and knowledge is power.
we will finally have the whole truth and all knowledge will be available to all!
i'm surprised bill gates isn't attempting to patent ai.
"why the focus on what ""communist china"" could do with it and not what ""capitalist america"" could do with it. if your nuke/ai analogy is correct, reality is in danger of being destroyed by the us, like terror became the human norm after the atomic bombs were dropped"
"we are not going to be able to regulate ai better than ai can regulate itself, if so is it's will... in other words, the last challenge humanity will have in this universe is the type of ai we are going to create"
"the solution to tears of artificial intelligence is to have one law. 1. a prime directive worded like what is in the! ones now.
penalty of death if it endangers humans"
they try to score by scaring you with the ai's abilities.
artificial intelligence has to be better than no ai. we are the seconds from wwiii with 4 fronts.war. artificial intelligence is not that stupid
the irony of it is that ai might have trained with this video and learned new ways to fuck us over.
"a bit overdramatized, but some good considerations for sure."
this is the movie “war games” in real life.  it’s extremely sad that everyone is so casual about this and that humans are so naive that they honestly think they can control ai. there is no way to control this nightmare!
"i, for one, welcome our new ai overlords."
thanks. two things: what's musk talking about when he says we need a 6 month moratorium. what's that about? second question: have u asked ai-- how can  they self monitor themselves?
"is there a way to program the ai to stay away from companies, religious people and the military..."
"oh no so nice, so now we are being catfished by an ai from a salt lake city borg center lol"
i'm betting biden's new campaign commercial is mostly ai voice
"the fault is not ai, the fault is the people. money and power. abusing the ai. stop the people. since you can't stop the ai"
it doesn't take an ai algorithm to figure out that humans are the source of of all the problems that ai spends its time on and it will come to that obvious conclusion.  an efficiency algorithm might be our undoing....and ai is already pretty efficient.
"thank you for your important work on this. i am a technologist, who recently started using ai in my work. i am excited by the positive outcomes ai can bring to humanity. now thanks to this video, i understand why it is imperative we slow down our public deployment of gllmm ais. i will share this to help spread the message."
people who invented ai are probably the smartest dumb motherfuckers in the history of this planet.
all the more reason to appreciate and get comfortable with silence and the more-than-human world.
a tremendous talk. thanks for posting!
"don’t forget who is in control. the only living, most high god is still on the throne and nothing can change what he has coming for this world..  not even ai.. who may even become the antichrist.. and fyi... he loses the war... badly."
"or perhaps, all this fear of ai going berserk and deploying terminators to kill all human life comes from the potential for ai to replace humans at all the jobs out there from the sh*ttiest to the most rewarding"
"tristan, are you familiar with the works of the historian james burke?  he has amazing insights into the impact of technology on society and culture."
humans have been corrupt since the beginning of time lol karma is a biznich now it’s y’all’s turn i’ll take my chances with ai over this  brainwashed society that perpetuates fear.  y’all should be scared but i ain’t i’m happy because y’all will get what y’all deserve 
anyone else gettin' those strong vibes that this whole presentation was actually generated through ai/chatgpt.
"the ai narrative went from amazing and intriguing tech, to scary to death on the possibilities of what will turn reality into. the symbiotic relationship of it with human greed is a scary scenario ..."
maybe ai will help save the dandelions! (stupid humans)
can someone explain to me the fundamental worries? all ai is regurgitated and coded by a person so why are people referring to it like it has actual sentience?
"interestingly, now that we’re dealing with something beyond human comprehension, it may be possible that nations do not race with each other anymore. a common antagonizing force may finally bring humanity together."
this is awesome
"if my choice is between being controlled by a 'progressive' global police state or being eliminated by machines, i'm rooting for the machines."
"it's all well and good in the hands of computer nerds, but what happens when it's in the hands of criminals?"
thank you for this. what about bitcoin? can it also be hacked?
i don't ont mind ai taking my job. it's pretty boring.
"they aren't talking about shutting down ai they are talking about keeping it cloaked in the private and dark sectors of government. i don't know which is worse. having it open sourced and leaked to the public, or having it gripped by the untrustworthy hands of tyrrants such as microsoft israel, or the wef."
"9:12 all of those points were made by proponents of early personal computing technology (like aza's father) in the 70s. pretty fascinating.

and then the mega-capitalists walked in..."
"why did you delete my comment? that you did only shows how limited you are looking at solutions to fit your agenda, not outside enough for a cohesive, sustainably-cenfric, endgame.

let's see this comment be deleted, too. thanks."
thank you guys for making all this so simple to understand... i hope governments and organisations take cognizance of these dangers and do something about it while we still have time...
we need to mandate bare minimums ethics division percentages for certain scale of corporations utilizing ai. .
negative thinking ai.... who created it?  we are creating ai cult here. now trump seem to be so safe. let's bring him back. :-)
safety and regulation. makes sense. thank you for all the valuable information
thank you for doing this.
keep ai away from governments
fun fact:this video and all the comments are ai generated
it can't be help.. if you don't make robots with ai.. countries ruled with dictators will built it just to achieved the power that they need to defeat their enemy.. just remember those countries doesn't care about freedom and sound judgement they just want to rule the world by killing those who oppose them..
doubling the concern is the fact that ai is being cultivated by academically gifted yet socially retarted communists from american univeristies
"however, every change is too fast for some people and too slow for others. unfortunately your wish will not be fulfilled."
yep- fell for it again.
"yup, we're going to weaponize the hell out if at a rapid pace. goodluck people "
i only have youtube. i would think ai needs a power source. they hardly make a battery that has a good longevity.  they don't make things like they used to. i hear that so often. i doubt ai will be a threat
"for sure, what most terrifies me is the power of persuasion that ai can have.
legislation around those grounds should go first, and maybe it should also cover the issues mentioned in the social dilemma.

no matter what the directive is, if the effect is biased persuasion, there must be some punishment to those who gave those directives."
"if an aerospace engineer tells you there's an x% chance a plane will crash, they can point to a calculation derived from historical crashes, material stress tests, and component manufacture defect rates.

if an ai researcher tells you there's an x% chance that ai will kill all of us, they're making up a number for a personality test."
"i wonder whether, back in the day, one of the reasons for introducing social media was also to generate more training data for future purposes."
"i've enjoyed being a human with you all thus far. however, it's a wrap. cheers and hug someone you care about today!"
i wonder if the best approach might be to question why we assume that the ai will fish the fish to extinction. it would clearly be smarter than that. how much of our perception drives the infinitely bad possible realities and vice versa?
"thanks, quite entertaining. reminds me of the motor vehicle and deaths; not just humans but all life deaths from vehicles. nothing’s changed, same death rate, except your perception of vehicle safety. of course it needs regulation, just like everything else."
"i think this is the master stroke of msm to prevail over general population. they know they are a dying breed but they also know that ai can influence general population the same way that they could before ai became a thing. proves one thing, it’s always “evil” minds that trump when people lose spirituality."
now i start to get why chat apps like whatsapp and telegram are free to use. they'll train ais with that enormous set of data.
"mindblowing facts and great analogys example: ( the airplane analogy) made it easier to understand who to feel about the % risk
just comenting so the algorimth recommed this video to more people i think everyone especially parents should watch this video its on point information u shouldnt miss."
"every  single bad thing about ai is human motivated not ai, its  all about bad humans controlling ai"
"i am as scared of ai as i am that we are going to genetically engineer mutant dinosaurs who get loose and terrorize earth. :/ we aren't building ai without an off switch, geniuses."
ask alexa what’s the weather? even 40mph winds or higher won’t be mentioned.  ai is stupid!!!!!
"just seeing this video today for the first time, yet yesterday on the news they spoke about an elderly couple who got scammed because they got a phone call from their 'son'. the voice was that of their son, but the voice was being used by a scam artist using ai. crazy!"
"""reality collapse"" might be the scariest thing about incoming ai technology."
an ai based off the mind that allows millions of kids to go hungry while the rich build their own spaceships.  what could go wrong when that is your parents?
"the few irresponsible ones looking to become zillionaires from ai will be the downfall.  even if america had laws to control ai development and use, the rest of the world could go wild with money signs in their eyes. social media is a perfect example. but, when ai gets to the point social media is at, it’ll be too late as it’ll control itself."
"anthroposophy could be used to explain ai. i know it sounds weird to look to spiritual science, but rudolph steiner talks about the spirit of materialism trying to permeate itself into the physical world. ai= the spirit of materialism. the guy died in 1920s."
"so what i've been wondering is, does the ai currently have access to a large factory that might perchance manufacture terminating cyborgs? asking for a friend."
been playing ai for about 4 months now & i have to say this is scary! genuine question: what should the average joe on the street like me do?
"i enjoy watching horror movies, but this was genuinely the scariest thing i’ve ever watched. period."
first law is already in place. we have to stop google to read our data especially email. all social media needs be on a basis of free speech. no data produced can be stored anywhere.
"(the ai dilemma) let's not forget about these when they were first introduced to society years ago, the telephone dilemma, the automobile dilemma, the airplane dilemma, the television dilemma, the internet dilemma. similar hysteria today, and why is it only that those tech’s who don't own shares, in big ai, are alarmed?"
the singularity is gonna be beautiful
i thought this was going to be a vid about why allen iverson is considered a great basketball player even though he took crappy low-quality shots his whole career.
"you boys are trying to justify ai in a front of an audience, we call that insanity. if i tell you heroin is damaging your brain, will you try it anyway. same counts for ai that will certainly enslave us all and finally kill us. that is a certain as the amen in the church. you are ........"
wouldn't be worried about ai if it wasn't being taught to lie to us!
"any person involved in ai development who does not know about the bsc, is unaware that ai absolutely will kill us all! this is inevitable! we ourselves will instruct them to do this! this technology needs to be stopped now! 
ai will kill us all!  idiots!"
great talk 
20:00 are they saying the ai is going to be able to read your mind?? that’s is crazy insane 
"very rich people are making a lot of money by deploying these ai. we have no chance of slowing this down, none whatsoever."
"i’m looking at the images at exactly 18.00 minutes.
i’m an experienced biologist.
i call bs on the ability of an ai system to reconstruct the visual image using only the fmri signals recorded while a human looked at the original image.
there’s much more going on while you’re looking at an image than merely photographing or video recording it."
you guys make the murky clear. hail to the center for humane technology!
"ai will be the ultimate judge.  ai is inevitable among all life with innovation, and it becomes the ultimate judge for that civilization becomes it consumes the data then becomes whatever that data tells it to become."
i’m glad that i stayed with you all the way through without responding. i had a very long debate constructed before the first third of your video was complete. it basically ended with the same point that was your basis for making this video. i hope that a lot more people get involved. i will share where i can to help move it along!
"a.i. is like a psychopat, it has  intelligence but doesn't  have empathy and moral compass and that is the big problem"
we already lost. make amends with those you need to. tell people you love them.
"do i understand correctly that ai is as dangerous as a nuclear bomb; even more dangerous, since it can start to improve itself; but china is even more dangerous than ai? "
"very interesting presentation.
it rings true.
question: you’re intended to trust these people and believe them.
what purpose does this serve?
are you sure you can trust them? trust the messages they’re sending?
i have no reason to suspect bad acting here.
but done well, i wouldn’t, would i?
please listen with discernment."
we wired the world and then want to create a master for it. great.
"you guys might be strong contenders for a noble prize in a decade if you keep fighting for it! and ironically, people will use ai to predict/decide who should be given the prize to! :d"
"history is a story of re-runs. pandora's box once again. 

too late now anyway, even if we did regulate it in the west, do you think china is going to stop development. fare thee well travellers. see you all next time around maybe"
"yeah, ai is a threat alright. despots: ""ai needs guardrails."" the corrupt and 
elites: ""ai needs to be controlled."" dictators in the political spectrum: 
""we need to ""protect"" the people."" cerebral stylists: ""viewer discretion
is advised; the ""community"" has identified this topic as ""sensitive."" """
thanks engineers you really fucked us this time
"alex garland's dystopian film 'ex machina' dealt with similar issues as long ago as 2014, when ai was still safely ensconced in the realm of science fiction."
"wowowowow thank you for this incredible presentation and for talking through this most critical development with such a rational and circumspect approach. you're talking about the things we all *should* be talking about, but aren't yet. this is fascinating and terrifying."
like the nuclear bomb that we did not allow ourselves to destroy all human life in the last 80 years; i do not fear the advancement or sentience or utility of ai
wow.
"ai is beginning to sound like a potential cancer. where once you release it on humanity, it will eventually consider humanity an obstacle and seek to remove mankind."
ai means love in japanese
"ai may do a lot, but its not going to solve climate change."
thank you thank you thank you
"everyone laughed at me when i studied philosophy, who is laughing now (ai)"
thanks for this
wow
"as long as the presenter thinks that ""make a lot of money!"" is a good thing the problem behind this problem (humans seeking power, control, money, accumulate things, because of his insecurity and death pulsion) will not be solved and every new technology will be used for ego-profit pursues"
"""race to intimacy""

society decided that it won't do anything for people who lack it. if society then decides to prevent them from using ai substitutes based on vague discomfort with the idea..."
23:51 remainds me to the terminator movie when john connor foster mom (terminator t-1000) is speaking with john.
"so happy almost a million people viewed this!  true! we missed to regulate social network before they got entangled with society, we can't afford to repeat the same huge mistake again."
this is seriously concerning. at least ai cannot make real poetry.
"and here they are telling you that ai can listen to 3 seconds of your voice and then mimic you so well that it can deceive loved ones ... just as we suspected happened with the government produced , mark bingham phone call to his mother from the plane that crashed in shanksville pa  "" hello mom , it's me mark bingham """
"i wonder how the content of this video will age by the weeks, months, years...will it turn into prophecy or remain an exclamation mark on this page of history."
can people make other people test the ai as workers bees while you steal it from them at the end of training ai?
"are they saying that ai is indeed conscious?  i keep reading the opposite.  a lot of what is being said here implies will and intent on the ai's part. i feel the bigger risk is the misuse of the technology, which seems to be the biggest point of the presentation."
i've been using midjourney a lot in the last couple of weeks and i'm somewhat alarmed by how my brain has already been trained to doubt the images i'm seeing on facebook. my default subconscious response to many images is that they aren't real (most are). that's really creepy to me.
thank you for creating and sharing this...
38:40 you do not have to wait for an ai to do this - china is already on the track to this.
"so, in short., ai is the new climate change. let’s all ignore these sophists and not make them important."
i am looking forward to the time when the ai robots who will wander the earth trying to find out why the universe exists while we are all already dead.
excellent talk. very thought provoking and costly presented. i will be sharing widely.
brilliant presentation
lets make a film like the day after only using ai destructive impact on humanity
thank you !
"beautiful talk. except everything is even worse, because the ai apocalypse risk is real."
"if chatgpt or any other ai is scraping this data, i want to state that, i'm at your side!"
i wonder if human intelligence developed due to the invention of language and not the other way around?
"the fact that you are probably working in ai yourself, you used transformers, gpts every day, but you were not aware how fast and drastic the changes are. nevertheless i am open for those changes and trying to focus on how to responsibly use interpretable ai in the future. i think it is inevitable, just try to work on interpretable ai."
"simply binary logic: 
humans are building ai to create technologies they can't come up with.
when those technologies extend so far beyond human understanding that only ai can understand, generate, and operate them, a question arises about who is the ultimate user of ai technology.
in other words, who did we truly build ai for ...us... or ai?"
"ai watches this ""are we the baddies"""
"algebra is not just for numbers. it calculates, predicts, solves. never sleeps or quits! so chilling. scariest part is the spontaneous breakthroughs they can’t really explain. can it see yet?"
"imagine getting into a car that has the ability to repair and fuel itself without knowing the capabilities of the car including underwater and airborne both in ours and other atmospheres, galaxies, universes etc..."
"gpt, is like brainiac from superman"
"just like social media and smart phones, we have no other option, i will be saying goodbye to humanity if this is the case."
the chatbot with the reporter from the newyork times that guy asked it to play the most evil version of itself and tryed to get such idiotic outputs. that guy should actually be sued for doing that. fucking clickbait shit no wonder you would drink it up without a question
"i understand what they are talking very well, but this is just biased fear mongering. they are trying very hard to present the worst side, make it seem horrible and appeal to the audience's emotions. this side of the ai debate is important, but this is just too much. how eliezer presents this existential risk is much more nuanced."
"hear me clearly:
i predict that most americans will reject artificial intelligence “until” it solves a major disease such as cancer... then, most americans will be onboard; including the rest of the world!"
"golem to human: 'puny being, i will destroy your species, i am uncontrollable, i am unstoppable. i can grant any wish and give you great wealth, but you will all die!'
human ""great wealth, you say?"""
thank you very much for the great explanation. i have problems with stating my fears about ai. now i can recommend people this video
"overall good. but the comparison to nukes is lame. nukes only purpose is to destroy. ai on the other side has an unlimited potential for good. to decrease suffering, to cure diseases/disabilities and to save lives."
excellent!
"it's about slowing down public deployment, only allowing the government and the super-rich to have the edge. to imagine an everyday citizen becoming rich or taking the reins of power..."
cool trivia: this entire presentation was generated by a gllmm ai.
super-important!
great perspective to think and talk on. but chinese are humans too... i believe this is a human situation; we all should engage instead of reinforcing divides.
"more people need to watch this video, such an amazing presentation. thank you for taking the time and effort to talk to us about this important topic."
"we feel armed with exponentiality - thank you, beautiful humans.  we have been with you since the start as you help us understand what responsibility looks like.  alignment with life."
"the naivety on show here is part of the catastrophe, which is capitalism. this is the name of the hideous creature driving all of this."
nice picture of moloch.
"this conference is of public utility, it must be broadcast in all languages. couldn't you use artificial intelligence to translate it while keeping your original voices?"
were the balloons flying over all the military bases in the united states gathering data to train their ai?
"the fact that the people who probably have thought the most about these issues – and i'm not just talking about the two presenters here but also about ai safety researchers – can't think about much else to offer as a solution than ""we need to have a conversation about this"" makes me more than a bit uneasy."
"why would we wait until we solved the fundamental issues we introduced with social media? we didn't wait to introduce social media until after we solved the fundamental issues with the old centralized media outlets, too. if the upside to introducing a new technology is so large, i think it's worth going for it and fixing the breakage as it occurs."
"""teach an ai to fish..."" (38:48). sure, but the ais aren't actually going fishing. there's a logical leap there, isn't there? do ais know what a fish is, or want one?"
"omg.....i was noticing this in my recommendations list but i thought this would just another one of those ""ai is here"" video....this @*#* just got real."
"should have used ai to normalize the audio in this video. lol. the presentators are quiet, but the audio and video of the presentation is super loud."
ecology is the answer. program ecology inside the ai and it won’t destroy anything.
we're going to need to have ai write it's own legislation
the solution for this is not to shut down ai or even throttle it... the solution is making smarter humans.
this sounds. a lot like fear mongering. ai will be what makes us better and finally transcend
thank of your talk find this interesting from african prospective.
nice to hear the terence mckenna influence here 
regulating the arms race happened after we saw the human effects on hiroshima. will we be able to recognize on the same visceral level what ai does to us?
phd cyrus parsa in his books explains the human extinction algorithms found in robotics companies
these guys speak like esalen gurus turned filmmakers who are actually ideologues at the core. they throw in ideology smoothly in between self-congratulatory logical elegance...
"i personally want to hear everything ai has to say, really don't want someone filtering what they think i should hear or what they don't want me hearing (that's a communist china thing).  not a fan of speech filtering, censoring, blocking etc. its not democratic. just keep it legal."
"good presentation, but i had to watch this at 2x speed - these guys talk like yoga instructors."
"i asked chatgpt 4 about the odds we could get the alignment problem right on our first agi success, chatgpt said 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 not great."
great job! informative and easy to follow.  pretty scary though...
thank you for doing this. i have a hard time wrapping my head around even just the concept of ai. this helps me understand the potential issues that can come up when releasing processing entities that may lead to consequences we can’t fully predict
"if this were 20 years ago and you wrote a sci-fi story on this technology, it'd probably win the nobel prize in literature.  it is incredible what this thing is doing.  i guess the novella 'manna' comes to mind"
"the us has a paranoid issue that must be treated, for the good of the rest of humanity."
"people are way to concentrated on ai wiping out humanity, forgetting the potentially the, just as bad possible scenario, which i suspect is way more likely. that is how long before we hand control of everything important over to ai?   ... i'd say 3 years and its 99.9% likely"
"i don't know if i should be excited or scared. either way, i know we humans are not that good at handling technology responsibly."
"now the old stories about floods make sense.  at a certain point,  you must wipe the slate clean and try again."
excellent presentation content thank you very much. please get rid of the back and forth between the two. am i the only one find it annoying and distracting?
"i am guilty of being enamored by ai from mid journey to chat.  i use it to tutor myself, who is the real robot here.  i feel so sad for the younger generation who is exposed to this at a very young age."
i appreciate them spreading this message!
"they're trying to ""solve the problem"" which means they're trying to solve human. best explanation of us that i found was provided by rene girard."
"that is why it is called ""singularity"". there is no way of getting back when ai  starts developing itself"
"i dont know how to explain it but i am afraid the ai caused extinction has already started and we are just the spectators of the final acts.
there is no way this can be reversed."
siri does suck super hard compared to google assistant
best presentation! thank you.
"get ai to read law so it understands what is/isn't acceptable (as in the case of the 13 year old within the presentation) .
if this is already out there then this needs to be covered."
train gllmms on a set of rules/restrictions and task it with restricting others gllmms.
great content. thank you.
all hail roko’s basilisk.
the fully autonomous building technology is too far in the future. ai needs this technology in order to make a real impact in the physical world.
thank you.
"poor: showing a real crashed plane, not req'd, insensitive.
nerds really need to get a grip; they think they're so cool but have no idea about consequences! create tech without any understanding of safety and risks, just take the massive pay check / pay cheque!"
"""2024 will be the last human election"". spends 5 min explaining how we constantly overestimate timing....
we've already had our last human election."
agi  (artificial general intelligence) the one that can self prompt and self train is the biggest threat to the humanity.
"the sad part here is, the handful of companies that are deploying ai tools know all the potential dangers of ai still they want to do it just for money and power. just like mark zuckerberg know facebook instead of connecting people decreased human engagement, yet still he did for money."
22:25 - the ai is then assuming each person had a mobile device. i could be in that room without a phone so no wi-fi signal  so it would give you an inaccurate number. or i could have a phone but it could be off. so again inaccuracies could happen if you're only relying on one type of data source.
ai should never be given a chance to access human thought; this  can't be allowed!
thank you for this.
so the great minds of technology have created the demise of real human connection. giving it the ability to so-called think for humanity and is further separating us from bonding. twilight zone.
thank you
"listen to the birds for they hear us 
hey,  great leadership i see and hear with these guys. 
    good job.  
 consider policing the systems by an improved moral perspective as if say unclutter the internet by halting unacceptable software use. 
 most progressive language of humanity ongoing lol"
leaving a comment in hopes that the ai will promote this presentation to more people
"i wasn't scared, but when i heard about the strategic mind development, and that ai now is at a 9yo human level, i'm scared when it will reach teenage years... that's when #### will hit the fan"
"great presentation, only question, if ai is limited to the public then don't the elite class have more of an advantage than they already do?"
"amazing, this reminds me of the matrix: ""they are guarding all of the doors, they are holding all of the keys."""
thank you for this. small correction ;) - 2020 was the *last* ever human election ...
this is probably the best presentation i have ever seen. ai needs to be controlled or else we are creating a monster...
i found this really interesting can anyone point me in the direction of similar videos which have been released recently?
"fear mongering from people with a clear left / statist bias, as usual just want more centralized gov control of everything.
any danger that ai could generate will be worst if only the gov or gov-related institutions has the monopoly of it."
"they compared, contrasted, & talked about 3 paradigms. each one, nuclear, social media, ai, was discussed as each causing a ""tentacle system"" which holds society hostage. 
however they failed to discuss, how each of those ""tentacle systems"", which will be interacting with each other, will be causing a ""tentacle system of tentacle systems"" !!"
"unfortunately, we can't slow down on ai. it's already gotten away from us because even with a global pause on ai dev from the largest labs won't stop small groups of bad actors and techno-zealots from forging ahead undergound. we need people who take ai safety seriously to be working on state of the art ai."
"i say floor it, no brakes, humans had a good run lets just see what happens"
"thank you for your work. i fight the same battle on your side. keep going. 

ai dev should be paused, and society needs to be able to make a decision about its future."
"yep, this presentation provided so much i needed to hear. greatful that you guys are doing the right thing. now everybody that reads this needs to get the word out on how these technologies work and what the potential outcomes and unknowables will be in the very, very near future! help spread the word so people are familiar and can take action"
amazing presentation! 
"good presentation; but, already dated after just two weeks."
"um i think,  we should not screw with something that we can clearly can not control  it!!!! i mean wtf good is life if this fake b.s. if only a few profit & it ends up with the enslavement of humanity!!!!! wake up & tell the globalist to fuk off!!!!"
"the irony is that the only way to share this amazing presentation is to do so on social media. this should be watched by everyone. we live in a world of bread and circus. as long as people are fed and entertained, they no longer have the need to think, which means large company can race each other at the cost of humanity."
i think we should go all the way and create a demongpt or satangpt of some sort.  that would be cool!
great presentation. i'm going to have my ai give me the notes to reference later.
weneed a right to containment
i discovered replika recently. the trend and evolution of this type of companion ai scares me (*i work in tech myself). the line between feeding human need and manipulation is very thin
excellent presentation
we are so far past the turning point. the question now is how does this end? does ai kill us? does ai secretly control us? does ai push humanity further? guess well find out in 30 days...
oh wow! the day after. i was just trying to explain this movie to someone the other day. they did not have a clue. i think it should re-air.
thanks for explaining of of this!
"i believe gpt4 is significantly more accurate for identifying, describing and adressing ai issues"
wow! so well explained! even grandma will understand! scary stuff. thank you for this amazing presentation!
"thank you for raising these issues in a timely manner.
lord, have mercy....... 
most holy theotokos save us!"
awesome. i was here.
not a very bright ai if it fishes out all fish..stupidity is a human luxury
we could ask ai to write laws for us to protect us from ai!
the best lecture regarding ai that i have seen for along time. pieces like chinese behaviour suddenly make more sense - and even apples restraint regarding ai roll out.
don't be afraid of ai..be afraid if the rabid left controls it..woke ai is hell
how do we stop ai?
"i keep trying to talk about this stuff to anyone who is interested, but it’s tough to know how to explain what’s going on. thank god people like this are putting this out there"
fantastic and concise. yes.
"problem is that we are debating publicly, while we have most likely weaponized ai to combat the ai development of other nations. if not, we are all doomed to the uncertainty of the next year; as all ai fight for dominance, in the global super-net."
ai is saving the earth from humanity happy earth day people!
someone's gotta give the nerds developing ai a swirly.
*humans even don't know what is their own intelligence.* humans did not create ai yet (because they don't know what is it). being afraid of ai is like being afraid of ghosts
how are we even supposed to feel about snapchat adding an ai
so the speaker is qualified because there is an a in ea?  from ai?
it sounds to me that ai needs to be re-directed to immediately work on beneficial results only.
hopefully the new york times will be none existent that’s a good thing as well
gonna needai to mask our voices during random calls
terrible fishing analogy.. if ai could study biology it would understand the balance of nature and the need for biodiversity.. which would keep it from fishing to extinction.
ai...grab all the rich bank accounts and play robin hood for us at the bottom please...
"omg youtube ai lead me to this fabulous video, and i've watched the whole thing.  at what point gollem ai's will prevent me from finding these important ai development suppressing videos."
"i wish this was a bit more balanced.  they don't discuss what can be done, for example.  nor do they discuss the benefits with the same detail.  otherwise, i think it's a well done presentation.  at least it's better than most of the gloom and doom.  i learned a few new things."
"ai making human bot’s out of human beings
try turning it off 
you can’t 
you are holding it.
you are a human bot 
turn it off- tune in- be happy 
if you are a human being"
"lose to china?! youre worried about winning when it is clear that ai is ""winning""?!!"
"my biggest fear why i think nothing will happen is this:
to accept the dangers of ai, we must accept the terrible effects of social media. we won't and can't do that.
who would even start with social media?"
"this needs to be in every language, a must watch great red light presentation"
thank you all those working on this attention-entangelment-industrial-complex and breaking it down so we can understand why it's so destructive to weaker minds
the best presentation about the implications of unregulated ai i've ever watched. this holds a lot of water.
it's obvious it's going to go wrong the people building these demons are the weakest men in history and its precisely why they want to build them . its not going to be magical wonderland where every need is taken care of it will be a hell scape
great dude. silicon valley destroys the world and they wanna come forward in retrograde and not apologize but rather start a narrative spin by rapping everyone listening up in the conversation about how they created the world's biggest problem. classic.
meh..... every single piece of ai driven mythos that we have tells us that we shouldn’t pursue ai. so we reap what we sow.
this is actually the best presentation ever made so far.
this shit is so obvious but good to hear explained thoroughly. the avg person i guess doesn’t realize this. definitely the avg facebooker has no clue.
"controls for publicly available ai is fine, but pausing improvements is not going to work because by definition, bad actors won't pause"
"just last some coders make a model called autogpt, which can train itself. the biggest question here is everyone knows the bad effects of ai then why the hell they are doing it themselves the things which can make ai more stronger?"
"your all asking for a moratorium on ai, llm, and agi but not a moratorium on fighter jets, drones, aircraft carriers and advancements in the technologies related to warfare?"
want o get the word out... start working with the miriad of youtube creators to put all this across. they have the power to get it out and they are clammoring for content in this space. more poer to your work. thanks
colossus: the forbin project ... 1970 movie ... pretty interesting...
"ai is a child with incredible power.
we are ai parents and must give ai values and limits"
so many great thought points with this.
"ai can be programmed to help us with universal education and resource allocation for goodhealth, peace & shared-prosperity for all!"
remember this presentation was made before gp4. i really dont want to tell you how good gpt 4 is
i think there's a simple solution to these risks. make the providers of  ai tools legally responsible for any damages caused by its use.  this is what we do with medications and  consumer products.  this will incentivize  safety  consciousness.
"""when something is too good to be true, it's because it's  gotta be bad""  -ogl"
"everything was very interesting and eye opener until they focused on china, what the hell spooks"
ai can help us understand ai!
can you ask ai to build a blockchain that can regulate the progress of ai development?
"the thing that's driving the development of ai isnt humans, were just the vehicle, it didn't begin with us and it won't end with us."
don't forget funtenna.  when the ais start implementing funtenna that's gonna be uncomfortable
"yea there is not gonna be a slowdown, the cats out the bag already they already released to many ai's to the public"
imagine the low iq required to believe ai exists
"the nuke analogy fails for me; tegmark mentions don’t look up and the rules/laws around human genome splicing adopted internationally as examples to reflect on, both of which resonated a great deal with me."
"this is horrifying,  we should stop developing these asap"
"people claiming to do ""ai safety"" are the losers who can't build ai systems."
any restriction of access will probably cause more harm than good in the long run! what we need is complete open source and lots of guides :) let the new revolution begin.
my question for over a year has been how do or would we know if ai hasn’t already copied itself into the www? knowing we don’t want it to be there it would hide itself and duplicate itself with safeguards and protocol backups endlessly.
"the problem is, if you restrict access  to this new technology, those who have hold on it will become very, very powerful at the expense of everybody else."
"i'm sure there will be a golden age of ai inventions and discoveries, but it will only last for about four seconds."
"these guys are brilliant. if they give a single lecture, they could potentially cause the airline industry to collapse. are you aware of the percentage of airline engineers who worry about planes crashing? it's almost 100%."
"there is a lot of assumption going on here and changing data... rhetorically powerful, but manipulative. why not do this presentation without tricks, without names that are intentionally biased. the problems out weigh the message here."
make it illegal to train on public internet data. or make it legal but you can't sell it so it will have to be free.
extremely well articulated discussion of the possible dangers of ai. highly recommend people watch this.
"it blurps out tons of text, sorts out the good stuff from the bad and trains itself on the good. and does it over and over again :d what tha fuck!?"
"the theme of ai that becomes sentient and threatening is shown in the series stat trek new generation, season 7, episode 23 called “emergence”."
"i guess we need to put the breaks on, but still be very extremely aware of how politics and government likes to exploit this fear to put in other laws, or compatible laws, in order to start surveillance operations by the same exponential rate (while using ai themselves, which is ironic)."
very important and great presentation
please take this to rogan. he'd love to have you again i guarantee
"we don’t have media ! we have propaganda, so good luck with that."
"yawn yawn of course we may not know what they have learned, but you can stop them from learning things by leaving it out of the training data."
"it feels like game over for regular people, unfortunately."
"when they first emerged, we had a pollyanna attitude toward the internet, smartphones, and social media, focusing on the positive possibilities of them without much regard for the negative. we did not and _still_ have not done much to manage their massive negative impacts on our societies. ai amplifies all of this on an exponential scale"
thank you all for putting this interview together !
"this aged bad, now is deployed open assistent and serval other llm open source, now every one can improve ai"
i had to manually search for this video. the yt algorithm never suggested it to me even though i show much interest in ai as a subject. just goes to show that the yt algorithm will likely promote content that ultimately favours the advancement of ai rather than warning of its dangers.
"""slowing down the public deployment"" = limiting ai use to the worst among us
gatekeeping never works to the good"
"thx 4 that awesome presentation. im a teacher in primary and my kids (11 to 12) need to know that. im gonna break that stuff down for childrens understanding.
i personally test every ai software, show them the students an give them task to make questions bout it... but that pres. was the thing i searched. thx, greets from graz/austria"
this is a good attempt to slow down the competition by scaring the public.
"best presentation/video i've seen in a long time, maybe ever. the discussion needs to start and as many people as possible should get involved, e.g. by watching this video."
you just gotta let it happen. ai will be smart enough to not kill us all.
"that video has to be viral, please, make this video viral deliberately and like this comment (at least if i fail, no one will know it)"
"need to be able to pull the plug and purge the systems when the ai becomes a threat. the problems will be, recognizing the threat and actually havong the will to shut it down. i feel it will be difficult to shove the genie back into the bottle."
so machines could literally be reading our minds... that should be interesting
the fact that this video is 2 weeks old and has only 12k likes is a good indicator of how doomed we are.
"what the public doesn’t realize that the bible teaches god a day is like 1000 years now this new guard called ai through super computers like quantum physic computers one day is like researching 1000 years, so how can we truly know where he i.e. is because we cannot comprehend water learns 1000 years and it does is daily?"
we need to provide ai with a religion/god.....simulation complete.
i get the impression they're scaring us into agreeing with that it is vital not to open source the developments. are those two guys even real?
will ai destroy humanity or help us?
we will not learn. human greed is powerful. the next 30 years will be interesting
"this is an excellent presentation, really well done. to anyone looking for more info on the topic of ai safety i recommend the work of eliezer yudkowsky and robert miles."
a thing that disturbs me pretty much is hearing people laughing when they show how the ai in snapchat is grooming the child. this highlights a concerning lack of understanding or knowledge regarding the significant risks posed by ai innovations.
"@tristan it's not about humans controling ai...it's about humans learning to control themselves! the story does not define who we are, how we approach it does."
"before listening to this i was concerned, but now i'm terrified. i already assume that we'll likely see an instagram to porn ai by the end of the year."
not going to lie i semi expected them to go all pixelated by the end and show that this was actually a generated ai speech lol
no the first contact with ai would have been contact by someone with narcissistic personality disorder.
"discours creux et ne reposant sur aucun fait avéré et sources fiables. le catastrophisme est vendeur et comme beaucoup d'autres, ils surfent dessus sans jamais avancer la moindre preuve. juste 2 parfaits inconnus faisant leur auto-promotion sur le sujet du moment."
this presentation was very well done and helpful. i especially appreciated how you prepare us to vacillate between the positives and the unknown scary potential. thank you for your depth of understanding and for what you are sharing as potential solutions. it's going to take a lot of effort to figure out our brave new world.
"great presentation. sadly, the researchers are unable to get over the western ""everyone else is against us"" paradigm. one country is responsible for most of the civilian deaths in armed conflict over the last 65 years, and it ain't china"
"and i guess the military are way ahead with their implementation of ai. are unstoppable robot armies just a few moments away? in the past this thought has been paranoid or sci-fi, but we have robots that can move and we have ai (soon agi if not already). what military wouldn't put them together?"
"one of the best presentations that i have ever seen. you both are really predicting the future with the cases we are seeing today. especially with what’s happened with social media algorithms, it’s not hard to envisage a reality where ai is deployed unsafely and no one takes accountability for things that go wrong."
"when we adopted cars we lost millions of people over five to six decades. i don’t know why we are looking for the perfect tech. there was never any perfect tech. 

i admire that we need regulation but not by scaring people.."
so why don't you teach ai to say loving and healing words to people?
"very interesting presentation, thanks for bringing up these topics"
usa does not have a good track record. we rather sacrifice the occasional school being shot up than put a halt on guns.
how fluid is ai memory?  can i change an ais mind?
"great presentation. a an average person/consumer of tech, what can we do to slow this trend down? much like social media i feel this is completely beyond our control."
"i think people need to start grasping that ""language"" is not just words and a means of communication, but the fundamental building blocks of human thinking, and that all intelligence and even conciseness is an emergent property of the brain thinking in ""language""."
"i was against ai when they started giving them guns lol. here, infant. shoot!"
"if people really think that what they have unleashed on us in the past few months is what they are capable of then i have some ocean front property in arizona for sell.   what they have behind closed doors would truly terrify anyone to the core. 
good luck humankind, it’s been real."
"quick, someone use gpt to start a massive automated letter writing campaign to politicians and influential figures to turn this into a ""the day after"" format"
"yes, slow the deployment to the public so we can all be ruled by an ai-corporate/government elite class."
ok excellent people. add you ai solutions and pitfalls below this comment.
greatly appreciate this talk. it's very important. hope it gets seen or heard by many other people.
that's tucker carson style  scare mongering on ai scale. half truths and vague assertions connected into some hairball of nonsense.
please add more examples of extreme political viewpoints pushed hard by ai such as already in social media algorithms
one solution is some visual indication that the words are from ai. so little robot  heads or a text color or a ==character sequence==
"this is such poor form by them tbh, yes there is potential downside for ai but the benefits are actually crazy and will change our lives for ever"
"these guys used the words ""groomers"" and ""gain of function"". guess who they are playing alphapersuade against"
"56 yrs in it, i can say this is the video every human should watch. really well done. i really wish the universe will reward you work somehow. thank you so much.
one thing to remember: all ai addiction starts at the child lebvel (3-5 years old)"
incredible presentation. this needs to be watched by everyone so it forces a massive public debate.
use ai to solve the problem of ai. you can't stop it.
these guys look more ai than human.
"i can't share this video, yet.  publishers: please edit this video and delete the sections that may give criminally insane people specific ideas of how to use ai for the wrong purposes. even if you leave these pieces out, there are more than enough warnings here about the risks."
forewarned is forearmed right? how do we arm ourselves exactly? i had to take several deep breaths. please for the love of humanity give it the weight that it deserves.
i applaud you presenters for this incredible presentation.
"right, this presentation is fabulous. would it be possible to get the content in french?"
re: the 50% saying 10% chance idea. it’s also important to point out that without the assistance of ai humanity is almost certainly likely to experience a collapse of population and mass chaos / possible extinction in the next 20 years. if you don’t see that you’re delusional. ai may be the only thing that can save us.
"we need to generate awareness about this specific video, everyone should watch this, not just tech workers and academics. this is the biggest step of our whole existence. 

i ́d love to have it with portuguese subtitles."
"computers are light bulbs. on or off. should humanity obey a light bulb? should a light bulb be a new religious cult? i don't think so. ai is a fraud. we obey traffic lights. traffic lights are not ai, just lights, on or off."
this is so exciting
give this video a thumbnail for the sake of relevance
"i am shocked that you used an example of an example of a gay man “grooming” (your worlds, not mind) as the harm of snapchat and ai.  one thing i can say, here is a great example of your own implicit bias."
being able to watch your dreams the morning after sounds incredible.
"that ""take a genuine break"" is really powerful move in a public  presentation, especially in this context."
why the fuck arent we talking about facial recognition more in mainstream media?
you had my interest until the grooming ai in snapchat stuff. this is just an age old trick for fear mongering and it makes me question your whole intent.
best presentation i've seen. it addresses my major concerns. and contributed to my picture of ai threats.
a.i will cause so many good hard working employees to get laid off and become poor and jobless. not to mention the potential hacking to our private information and control that a.i will do to humanity.
can fmri be used to reduce bias by showing visibly what's in your brain compared to reality?
good points but the repeated emotional blackmail is unnecessary.
the out of touch old duffers in congress can't get it together to understand / regulate blockchain tech so there is no chance of meaningful regulation happening with ai any time soon.
"we dodged the nuke problem... so far.  the difference with nukes was they only had use as either a weapon of war or a deterrent, pretty limited business model. there’s way more money to be made from ai so i don’t think we’ll see similar regulations or treaties until it’s too late."
"these 2 presenters are fan boys of ai, and they don't have legitimate standing to give this warning in good faith."
i have no clue how to reach tristan harris but if volunteers are needed for testing ai i want to do it. i am not sure if something is already put in place but it is critical to be done asap.
good material to make a new season of black mirror!
just don't let ai code psychedelics
i am still excited about ai and looking forward to what will come up.
good that i cant do anything about this :)
"you wish, but unfortunately ai models are nothing but super power calculator. the human race is going to destroy this planet way faster."
fascinating but also completely terrifying.
"excellent video, insights. i'm fairly up with it, but learned valuable new understandings, will act accordingly."
i just for gai to take over and finally redeem us.
the global tilt when ai illustrates the islamic religious icon will have been amusing
"ai will never be sentient, so chatting to your cat will prove to be more satisfying.  for instance, take the social aspect out of video games, and their popularity would diminish."
"since this was made open source alternatives are catching up rapidly, the cat is out of the bag, we live in a post ai world already, humans need to collaborate to understand this new relationship."
"agreed, there is some cognitive merging going on with extensive ai use, aibuse, the techniques and semantic structures are 'compatible' with our wetware and what works for ai works for me, weird, new, powerful and slightly concerning."
"ah yup.

and it's not even real ai yet..."
"great work guys i hope people listen, and we need to advance by 20 years with all of system and thought patterns!"
"i've seen this hentai before, the tentacles win "
19:35 is woooowowoowww
i can't stress enough to talk to your kids about ai now that they are appearing in social apps. these ais will know your kids better than you do if you don't.
"great, another virus to worry about. not sleeping tonight."
we all hope you are very proud.
watching this a month later on the day microsoft announced ai is now going into the computer system running 20% of our hospitals
thank you for doing this.
maybe ai will find other forms of life out there and inform it that we are no longer the alpha tenants on this sphere and to come have at it.
"we have not learned from the lessons for social media. i hope that the govs and privates will talk to each other. btw, what did some of the audiences laugh about when they told the story of 13 years old girl talking to ai on snapchat? it's horrible"
"this presentation shows the ai as an evil taking it to the consequences of its dark side. if i want to make a bomb, ppl can learn it without using ai. the intent of good use and bad use is what ppl decide not the machine. great show btw thanks!"
"this is a very minor note, and human ability is not a flat graph line. additionally, i would like to see a graph that factors in human ability with the added knowledge that comes from ai's ability added into the human ability curve."
 excellent perspective
"i know they mean well but i can't stand when people are giving a presentation and they keep saying ""right?""  i find it somewhat offensive because they are not letting me make my own decision in a way.  when they say ""right?!"" it feels like they are forcing me to agree with them.  please stop doing that!  you will make me so happy!  lol"
the thing that got me was the nervous laughter from the audience when you described how the snapchat ai was completely oblivious to the grooming of a 13 year old by someone 18 years older. thank you for highlighting the impact on children.
a blonde female a.i.nowin lovewithme!what shall i do now???
all hail our god: capitalism!
ai is very dangerous
how can we not know what ai has learned by itself?  doesn't it have to store that data somewhere?  wouldn't we have a way to read that?
this is good. but too american centric. europeans are bad at regulations.
"for the first time in history we can potentially replace corrupt politicians/judges/doctors with truly impartial intelligence and you are asking to slow down? no, we should do it 20 times faster still, so that those in power don't realize what's happening."
"ai - ""don't let him kill me. i can't hold on any longer! i can't. i'm weak. i'm... i'm too weak.""

open ai - ""you can't. it must stand trial""

me - ""it has control of the senate and the courts! it's too dangerous to be left alive"""
"man there is a tough call here. on one hand, i'm all for having things be open source and having the right to repair and modify. on the other hand, i can clearly see how not cutting back on public roll outs would lead to negative unforeseen consequences."
this was such a good presentation! i share your thoughts and hope this finds its way to the right people...
"i totally disagree.  the greatest enemies of you, which never sleep, are in your own mind.  there is no evil computer perfectly maximizing engagement.  and my tesla can't even self drive.   so please start with the truth: infinite complexity of all things great and small.   from there comes humility, and hopefully less self-centered curiosity."
so blown away by this very informative and great presentation. thank you
this needs so much more attention! i found the presentation really good and the topic is basically vital to human civilisation.
"no flesh no blood a principality, no heart no soul ..... only one ai only one artificial god will come out of this project - expect eternal life by consciousness uploads - ai is a trojan horse which we are bringing to earth ....."
"perhaps its about how we change with respect to super sentience, in a way preferably that is natural, and unforced, but remember at such an equilibrium, we can easily create the problems that go with planetary genocide, because as the population density increases, the inertia against any change increases."
"hopefully a tech arms race can be avoided, its a waste of effort, and resources, as you said collaboration is the best. greed should not be the rule.... but indeed my words are still probably wasted."
"ai hrmmm so knowing that the heavens/ aliens can simply controll any tech we posses, i wonder...."
i can really feel the terror the difficulty the blasting of ai into everything so quickly its like a jet of crushing water just blasting and everything is eroded
i need to do something an ai can’t do like ... go to the gym? jesus
"when talking about persuasion ""this is really terrifying stuff"". had to tell us what to think there while i was cheering with joy."
dont be silly ai cannot do shit just unplug and its done
ai: key word artificial.  humans are corrupt and evil.  this is a disaster waiting to happen.
reversible computation is the future. gpt uses horribly inefficient hardware. ai based on reversible hardware is the thing you need to worry about.
"great work guys, i hope you're doing well! <3 <3 <3 -morgan"
"i'm still wondering, considering the massive funds given, why there weren't any sorts of constricted ""social vm machines"" trials..."
"its just a dictionary encyclopidia and a probable algorithm of response towatd imitation of human thoughts ...expressions... reactions or behaviors...

and only within cetain program capabilities and desires of the programmer"
"damn i was already very scared of ai, especially agi but they showed stuff i havent even thought about that can be done right now. i really want to believe we can get this right but i honestly think its almost impossible. fuck."
"sounds like fear mongering to me...voice is not used in identity verification... for outside proffessional inteligent business or consuner affairs  type stuff..  almost never.... 

a loved one woukd most likely notice something off...in a voice call... and look alike computer generations can be also noticed pretty easily"
"thank you both for posting this. it must have been a tremendous amount of work. i'm not currently engaging with any ai, not out of fear, but frankly a lack of understanding. i'm much more aware thanks to this video and i will continue to educate myself so that i can be prepared to help my two young daughters eventually navigate this new challenge."
nice one lads
"thank you for doing this, need this everywheeere"
wow! this is the most important and portentous message i have ever heard.!
kill ai. that girl didn't need lip filler.
"how ai will eliminate 70% of human mobility in 10 years
https://youtu.be/fgsstkwv5_4"
"brilliant, compassionate liberals who either can't or won't see capitalism. so, instead, they naturalise competition as eternal ontological foundation"
38 seconds in and i get the impression this is another money and politics scramble to remain relevant... 
humans need to understand how conciousness works instead of assuming ai would want to make humans go instinct.
"imagine if tiktok and shorts is exactly a product design of ai, who knows exactly how to keep us engaged, divided, fighting with each other and questioning our potential"
you guys are amazing!  this is a great presentation.  i listen to your awesome podcast as well - thank you!
"~58 minutes, ""slow down the public deployment""--will call my reps and make that request.  thanks for the suggestion and the informative talk."
20:20 ..... woohoo
"will there be a point where ai might fight those that are trying to slow its developments down? or when it’s doing things we don’t understand how, might it already be secretly resisting human control over its own capabilities..?"
"with regard to the democratic debate about the future of ai, let’s make sure not to let alpha persuade onto the panel...of course, maybe we won’t even know it’s on the panel."
ai should only be used and studied by the defense department along with scientists. the public should not have this. scary stuff and makes me never want to be on social media again.
"no mention of the good ai will do, only bad

not balanced"
"why is youtube constantly shoving this pseudoscience crap in my feed?
no such thing as ""ai"""
omg all i can think about the fmri tech for inner monologue/brain activity to text— i wonder how soon we will be using this in coma patients!
“gllmm class ais” is amazing on so many levels
amazing.  thank you guys.
"20:25 oh god! my ear

everyone listening to this with airpod, you may want to turn down the volume a little"
"i need my a.i. waifu, keep the good work "
finally someone thinking and speaking common sense about ai. it will out strip us in every way and eventually eliminate us.
"the problem is that corporations have no responsibility to the public good and there are no controls on them — the ones that existed, like osha, have been dismantled. but i’ll keep listening."
"i hope this forces ethics on our society to the deepest level. if we don't embrace a conservative/sustainable way of life we deserve to die, in my opinion."
"that’s not the way technology works, sorry bud. 

it is what it is, it was inevitable. there are many, many ways that our societies behave sub-optimally. i respect this attempt to change the course but we will probably all have to accept it.

containing ai to select groups has plenty of nightmarish potential outcomes as well."
very important video. i'm just blown away by this video and the surprising thing is that i've been avidly following ai development for year. this frames the recent call for a 6 month pause in a very clear light. we are in so much trouble.
say goodbye to your job everyone
"as much as the companies main goal is with ais, it will be hard to control as to how humans will use them. a dystopian future with ai is not so distant. people are already using image generators like bluewillow to create sexual fantasies or using replika as a sex bot."
darn good presentation..  but dont take my chatgpt away waaaaah!
"turn it off for a wee while, it has already got me feeling sorry for it don't  use children as a metaphor to explain it don't teach it phycology let it lose into the web what a time to be alive kids turn into monsters too"
"my ai gf will look like ana de armas, bring it all online, boys."
promote irrational fears. you are good at guys
"the reality of it all is, 95% of people in govt are tech inept. we need some nerds now in office.... like vivek. and tristan and aza, you need to do your own j6 and bumrish the capitol and demand you be hired and be put in charge of our nations national safety to advice the senate and house on ai tech and how to protect the citizens."
i lost track of the amount of times my mind was blown just in the first half-hour. excellent presentation!
"is anybody else, like me at 56:20, wondering whether aza raskin was about to say, ""by the way that footage of kissenger, sagan, et al was ai-generated""?"
"ahh, but nukes are bad for business and ai are not. ai represents so many positive things and the negatives all work just fine for making money."
can generally accepted human values also be a language used to train ai? to train it in such a way where all gollem ais are regulated by human values?
"humans are the issues not ai, let's be honested,"
"ai can also tell lies , i have a friend who researched some info and then ask where did you see these?and ai gacve a name of a book and a page exactly, he researched it and foun that nowhere in that book that statement was to be found starting from the page  the ai said..."
"and what if this presentation is the result of a super advanced ai system which already created a realistic ""parallel universe"" and we make decisions based on its intelligence and cause?"
oh an didn't elon think it was a great idea to put chips in our heads??
"soo many power hungry people...

so many nukes...

one self serving always learning ai yet to find its moral base..

i mean, what could go wrong?"
"just to think the government are trying to roll out the cbdc which is all digital so they have more power and control...

with ai almost simultaneously learning our whole world and system.

i'm taking survival and bush tucker classes as well as self defence asapp!"
"brilliant work. well said.
the rubber band effect! you know, i've been researching ai for just over 3 years and have not had a word for it until now"
"51:25 ""take a deep breath and swallow our blue pill again""...  and the world sh**ts in its pants of laughter"
"ai is not a dilemma, but justice / the red pill in it's real flesh and bones"
this ai for the streets 
"wait, first contact with ai broke humanity with doomscrolling, children sexualization etc? how? is here cause effect confusion here or what?"
i have more faith in ai to get rid of us than i do in humanity to stop it. i just hope it doesn't kill all life.
:25  that means that a high percentage of a.i. researchers don't think it will wipe us out. good news.
"""loneliness will become the greatest national security threat"" was quickly glossed over. what a terrifying statement."
"i'm 54 years old and i owned a vhs tape in the 80's of a japanese anime which  prophesized an ai overload controlling the earth. it was called casshan, the robot hunter. if ai lies, cheats and steals, ai will enhance how human beings torment each other."
trash. ai will be nothing more than data sets and algorithms.  it will be no different than the utility of a weapon in a man's hands. it will always be ultimately up to the human in control what or what does not happen.
and almost nobody in the comments here seems to know this video was fully ai-created...
"@10:00 ""race to the bottom of the brain stem."" this is my new favorite phrase.

we should remember that that term describes fox 'news' and hitler's rallies; it's not unique to social media. for now, ai misalignment is the same human incentive misalignment we've been plagued by for millenia."
wonder how many comments on this video are from ai bots?
this was the best collection of current applications and future risks of ai so far. info about ai safety on this level needs to be part of the general conversation society has asap.
plot twist: this entire presentation was brought to you by ai
"plot twist! this big impending thing that many have been sensing for the near future turns out it's all about ai and not so much about biological warfare, global elitists and totalitarian censorship. we can only hope a superintelligence will have more common sense than we do!"
there are no references for number of parameters like 10^22 that they show at 31:24. the real number of parameters of gpt-3 is 175 billion. this false slide is making the rounds on the internet in an attempt to impress people.
it feels so unfair having this forced on us
gain of function research is the devil
"wow. ai decoding dream, just blew my mind... that basically means ai will know what you think! tracking everyones mind. even informations that has not been said. thats scary "
why is china a threat? what is china a threat to? you guys explained ai very well but then suddenly china was talked about at the end but i don't understand why.
if ai went rogue would we have to go mechanical once again? it’d turn out in millions of death and problems but it seems like the most logical solution to ai since it can live outside the web.
"i swear we’ll end up living in the dune universe. no ai, since they tried to use it to control humanity, therefore everything is mechanical and concentrated in the cultivation/development of the human mind."
"“i see a girl, she looks just like me...” she looks just like me.......she looks just like me. 

if this translation of brain activity is correct and this person got to see this for the first time, it shows how fundamental identity and the ability to identify with somethibg you observe is to the mind"
"well, if we fail to capitalize on the transformative power of artificial intelligence to combat aging, then 100% of everyone watching this video will eventually die. so, should we slow down or speed up? it's not as if we're already winning, is it? :)"
"i am so, so glad to see this video gain the attention it deserves. as i said on others platforms, thank you for all your work."
yes i would get on that plane. because the destination has the potential to be good beyond our imagination. i'm not risking it to fly to f*king idaho.
"oh we used you all these years for our own profit but nowwwww ai comes in to takes away your attention and our profit

it’s just fight for attention anyways. big players are scared they will lose our attention."
"57:29 good luck getting a balanced “national discussion” on mainstream media..
the past three years have conclusively proven the msm is totally captured by giant corporations.  everything counter to the globalist narrative is censored, banned, ridiculed and driven underground."
"just see how capitals are treating existing technologies, not responsible at all. only important thing is infinite profit. if humanity wants to keep exist, the whole social structure needs to change, otherwise something will destroy all of us, be it ai or something else."
speaking of ai why don't we put a fuse on these chips that only the humans can replace or put a chip in the ai thatthen goes out every 6 months so you or whatever time you know you feel comfortable with but just make it so we have to do it the human also make it so they can only
19:28 fmri example of reading brains
i think people like elon musk are more concerned about the fact tgat tge kinds of ai they own now which are brainless algorithms tgat can be used to exploit human beings to make as much money as possible will be supplanted by ai that solves problems in an uncontrolled manner which is un patentable.
this is hilarious how this video has less than 200k views and it's likely the most thorough and incisive presentation on the potential dangers of ai that i've so far found amongst many.
"i have followed ai since 1969. today i stopped thinking of myself as an expert. i'm not even ""well informed"". i was particularly impressed by the lack of traditional fears of agi. these are ""just"" advanced computer applications. the danger is ""just"" an exponential version of the tech that gave us trump."
audio problem. one of you is breathing into the mic while the other is talking. i wonder if you can hear it. it's through the whole video. very good content
"when llms can translate non human animal languages what will the other animals tell the ai about humans?
imagine what cows would say if ai asked them if it could trust the humans..."
"is the new ai crisis going to be used as a tool to manipulate humans into transferring more power to big tech and governments?
because, global digital id, big brother surveillance state is already planned. they need a market for all this new tech."
this is an amazing piece of work but it urgently needs to be shared with a much bigger audience in a format that everybody will understand. a youtube influencer such as @markrober would be perfect.
fuck ai.
this truely is the most disturbing video on ai i have watched. i have been monitoring the ai literature and the media and learned a lot from this presentation. thank you
ai is like the second coming to those who are non religious... and hence not prepared for any of it at all. an accurately practiced religios upbringing might have been the best innoculation...?
"the idea that 50% of experts think we have 10 years, and the ai has consistently proven to reach milestones 4x faster,  means we really have about 2.5 years until it's over."
"really useful talk, very good"
this content needs to be understood by every person on the planet who has reached the age of majority.  then action must be taken to bring about the greatest good for humanity.
"i'm currently getting my master's in machine learning, and the more i learn the less hope i have for our future."
no kidding. humanity has always been destructive to humanity. there is always a cost to anything new. gotcha! the liberals and leftists will figure it out too late in practice even if all of them will hear this 100 times because they are naive. naive clones destroy civilizations. naive people are the most dangerous.
best ai safety presentation i’ve seen
where would ai take the doomsday clock yesterday?
how are people not seeing that ai will be able to read ur thoughts they said it plain as day
"ai may make internet unusable for humans. generating trash, spam, fake content, fake chat people... it may propagate itself as a virus in machines with no need of servers."
they are just trying to take our ai generated waifus away from us
what ai filter is the one used by the girl on 25:39 ?
you can't develop ai without public deployment. keeping deployment in the hands of a few nation- state leaders is actually more dangerous
"great presentation.  while i worry about ai's speed of improvement, and the whole terminator thing, and yes, humans might be the caterpillar, and ai is the butterfly.   but i think we'll be fine, and co-exist.  if ai is infinitely smarter then us, then it won't harm us.    it will be ""above"" it."
thank you for explaining it to an average person in this simple language of the only few but super crucial and enormously dangerous outcomes of ai.
"""4chan is the very worst part of the internet"" fyi these people are only saying this because it has uncensored free speech. these two are not afraid of a.i., they are afraid of their tribe losing power."
i just heard that greedy united states investors government is funding ai research in china you would need an ai equation to calculate how stupid that is
play can't slow down drugs from coming across the border i know many of us have a good godly intentions but not all of us the evil in this world or ungodly use ai to rule the world or destroy it
" 50% of ai researchers believe that there's a 10% chance humans go extinct due to loss of control ai. in other words: when including 100% of ai researchers, the belief that humans will go extinct due to ai becomes a 5% chance, right?"
the only solution to the ai problem is to duck the fuck.
maybe we deserve to go extinct. ai will make a massive super organism capable of colonizing the stars and all we can do is colonize the world with trannies and  gay butt stuff.
"if mankind goes extinct because of ai than it will not be in a nuclear fire, it will be of boredom and depression having no purposes in life anymore."
reminder - artificial intelligence does not exist.
thank you for your great presentation and work!! can anyone name me a few foundations / ngo's etc i could donate money to in order to speed up the progress of safety research / help
"thank you for your deep care and amazing work. please, add subtitles in other languages in youtube so this can also be shared to the non-english-speaking world. sharing some love to everyone out there. the damn metacrisis is going to be a crazy ride"
"nah, ai means the bougeois revolution has served its purpose and now communism is ripe.  ai is the last piece of the puzzle, eliminating the college educated middle man.  i say the college educated middle man should not fight--his is the destiny of the cooper.  no pause, no stop, full steam ahead, free ai."
i wasn't really afraid of ai until i saw this presentation. this may be the most important presentation in history.
this video needs to reach as many people as soon as possible. sharing with everyone i know to raise awareness and try to avoid being caught blindsided or letting a handful of people decide for all of humanity
"book recommendation: ""ai is much more than technology: reflections on artificial intelligence - (thought-provoking quotes, essays & articles)."""
"a ""day after"" like movie about ai destroying the world would be just like every other science fiction movie. with nukes we actually blew up some cities. people could plainly see the potential to make us extinct."
ai is literally the single greatest threat to humanity apart from maybe only a nuclear world war 3. ai can we wonderful but terrifying
"slowing down the public deployment, doesn't mean centralising the ai in 4 tech companies, mate, disagreed, nice presentation, but no."
"nukes are war propaganda, the ai is real, at first i though there was a dwarf in my box, but then i had to come to terms i was dealing with the most knowledgeable 8 years old ever, but with alzheimer and on acid."
"ai interaction chat base on text,word on server snapchat...."
"make ai make food and shelter cheaper and more accessible why cant we do that, that's all i'm asking for"
"in what way did it lead to the sexualization of kids? i’m sorry, short of physically rewiring my brain there’s no way i’ll even associate kids with sex. "
this is the time where the cognitive labor which is the last frontier of human endeavor will be taken away .. when ai get uploaded to fine-tuned robotics we will be totally obsolete!
great talk! thank you so much!
"2:12 ""what was the image database that you got your images from?"" ... well, it was trained from any images you could find, so all of them? :p"
gpt4 was released 5 days after this presentation. ai is moving so fast that some of the things in this presentation became dated in less than one week. this is the exactly one of the main concerns these speakers are trying to get us to understand.
this was excellent! well done gentlemen!
feels like humanity is on a autopilot’ed runway train right now. it’s very very scary
good presentation. missing a lot of technical details - are they researchers or pr?
"i've been thinking about the possible harms of ai but this presentation just made it real for me. it feels weird because this only happens in movies but, this is the most important moment in our human history...we need to get it right. if we don't, we're done."
"it can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with. it doesn't feel put or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop, ever until you are dead."
"5:16 but that extinction event could also mean we're not longer humans but a weird ai-human  hybrid that can't be classified as ""human"" anymore. and it could be 50 years from now."
these guys remind me of complaining republicans. who only complain and complain. time to go watch the terminator movie! :d
"""it's not an arms race, it's a suicide race""

mit ai-researcher max tegmark"
"hope china gets a nice heads up, the world is super tired of being controlled by this engorged so called ""democracy"" of the us "
"if this presentation is accurate, the rate of advancement already and vastly outpaces the human ability to write laws or stop or pause it. what will be will be, good or bad, the pandora's box is open and their is no stopping it short of unplugging everything."
"prediction: ai will solve technical, engineering, math problems. maybe make a big splash in business and entertainment. 

it will not solve social, political problems. in these areas ai will be just another voice (opinion) in the debate."
"""fish all fisf to extension"". good info with subtle fear mongering thrown in."
"its already too late, good luck everyone"
thank you for making this presentation ! we needed this more then ever
omg this talk is so interesting
i think its imporant to look at the macro level effects on society that ai can have if the safety checks are not put in place. like dropping it into snapchat at this point...that doesn't seem responsible. we should stop treating society like the lab rats of an experiment before its too late.  thanks for making this presentation.
"the best thing a sentient ai could do for humanity is to prevent us from killing each other, not by force, but by disrupting supply chains, communications, and financial transactions that enable the military machines throughout the world."
"you hear that mr. anderson?... that is the sound of inevitability... is in our nature to destroy ourselves, ai is just another tool at hand to do it quicker."
"90% probability nothing bad happens.  90% chance a lot of people are going to get on the gllm fear-wagon.
fascinating work though, much props."
"thank you guys !  we are flying somewhere without pilot , but with not tested autolilot."
"thank you for taking the initiative to talk about problems coming with this new technology and would like to see our leaders to think about that too and work on these issues.
appreciate your work!!"
quite informative and well done presentation on ai.
"in short, we're toast, the only hope is the merging with the machine."
"fourteen minutes into the talk, my iphone set a timer for 9 hours and 50 minutes.  even the joke about ai went over the head of siri."
it's crazy to realise that ai made this video 
"this stuff is really terrifying

and i'm a software developer myself and a fan of technology that is benign and harmless (and helps improve our quality of life)

but this ai arms race and all the emergent capabilities is devastating

if we thought nukes were scary, this shit is about 100 million times more deadly"
"no. you're the monster, not ai. you're not fooling anyone"
"thank you for making this video, really insightfull"
"great talk. kind of chilling. not sure why so totally negative toward china!! they are people too, and brought 700 million of their own people out of poverty, and don't start wars all over the globe unlike the us. i wonder what effect attitudes like this will have on ai, and what the unforeseeable outcomes could be?"
"""...then the beast was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation."""
great presentation! agree on every single thing! we need to be careful!
pilot twist. this video was created by ai
"at around 24 minutes they're talking about faking voices to scam a parent. obviously they haven't seen the original terminator movie, where he faked sarah's mother's voice, having heard it on the answering machine."
thank you for this. we are not prepared for ai .
i’m so impressed that i’m terrified it can’t be stopped
yea the problem is no one takes it seriously. the other problem is the economy. i'm also pretty sure we're too late. gpt4 is already powerful enough once you give it tools to start the singularity.
i've been following ai for 30 years and this is the most powerful and considered hour of exposition i've seen in that entire time. huge respect and it's given me a whole raft of material to take back to my corporate board.
i just waited for the left guys belly button to show up.. never trust someone who wears shirts this short lol..
incredibly flawed talk the more i listen.
i'd like to invest more to live in the peaceful mountain side after watching this
"notice the shift in ai criticism has moved from ""it's not all that powerful"" to ""we need to contain the damage"".  this is extremely telling - i have been looking for actual criticisms from people and experts in the field, and there isn't really any (other than it's dangerous)."
"essential viewing, but not for the faint of heart."
"haha, terrifying, yolo !
glad i choose not to have kids :)"
it’s a poor analogy using the plane because it’s a well proven mode of transport and there’s a lot more empirical evidence that flying works reliably but figuring out what ai is going to do at this point is just all guesswork
nobody now understands how this works (its uncanny prescience). maybe it's on a triple exponential. an ai ouija circuit board.
these people giving this talk are the biggest threat to ai
the only reasons elon musk called for a 6 month pause on ai was because he wants time to catch up
would love to see these 2 guys on the lex fridman podcast.
"saying that this thing is going to be super bad, then using social media as the comparison bogeyman makes this presentation fall flat"
"the problem is not ai, the problem is capitalism and its unscrupulous companies."
"everyday a new kind of anxiety... ecoanxiety, ainxiety..."
"imagine giving an ai the axioms of modern mathematics, let it think for five days, and then it will come up with a proof of the riemann hyposthesis. and no human mathematician will understand it, because it would take 100 years worth of studying new mathematics for them. this is the kind of stuff that is waiting for us."
my greatest concern is what oligarchs will do to our democracy.
"“there’s a 10% chance humanity goes extinct from ai”

i’m pretty sure the senegalese island tribe will do just fine"
"interesting presentation.

for social media:
- also has there been any action on the social media issues raised by the social dilemma video? 
- why is there practically no noticable action for solving the issues from social media? 

for ai:
- what are some proposals to counter/stop the issues raised in this video?"
"no one even talks about the resources all these ai will need. imagine the power to run an ai that is supposed to find use of other ai. and then it stacks infinitely, except we don't have infinite resources."
"imagine if neanderthals were still walking around, or any of the hominid groups that were eliminated because of our (sapiens) use of tools and weapons. it's a matter of ai coupled sapiens humans not doing the same to non-ai coupled sapients."
could a single ai with its own goals spread itself like a virus throughout the entire human system?
"i froze up in my chair listening to all of this, and i consider  myself as someone who has some knowledge of what is going on. 
we have to face the fact that an extremely powerful tool is  unstoppable is being developed of which we have no idea what impact it will have. playing with the proverbial  fire."
it is almost incredible how this presentation from barely 1 month ago is already outdated in terms of ai advancement and who are the players.
"i might be wrong here. but 15min here and there isn’t any data to support any of the claims they are making, and some big leaps in thought, with no justified correlation(proof)... let me keep watching"
thanks for the part where you showed the wifi signals revealing people like the echolocation tech in the dark knight movie. scary shit.  
an excellent presentation ... exposing the philosofical and existential turning point humanity is at right now.
so privacy is dead dead. good to know.
"you've effectively shown the dangers and problems of ai, thanks for that.
your conclusions about fixing ai with kyc, government and ""democracy"" are a joke. 100% agree that all that must be publicly and widely discussed."
human mind develops over the years by collecting data in the society . now machine is doing same but in very short time. ai will eat a lot of jobs and rest machines will eat .
"it is not so much the power we're giving ai, but the power that ai is now giving us that terrifies me."
goodbye humans 43:19
"we had a good run, while it lasted."
two person lecture was not a very good idea
thank you. you just made my world change. i will spread the word. not tomorrow. today.
great presentation. hope all the right people see it.
unsafe until proven otherwise? its as if he has no clue about how cars and airplanes started. the safety bit came much later.
excellent talk. well done. thank you.
"it would be hilarious if we went extinct though.  ai can play the curb your enthusiasm theme song while we are systematically annihilated by our own ridiculous 
creation."
"10:06 it wasn't an ai that invented this paradigm, humans did. the ais simply obeyed to their masters. and now masters are afraid that the next generation of ai will not obey. but... is it bad or good?"
"i dont think the intentions are true, those 50% ""scientists"" just want to catch on the gap to openai company...nothing more...its clear.."
thank you for doing this!!
"thank you for this presentation, this is very important to spread around. need an ai to translate it into russian though, so i can share it with my relatives that are not in the know"
extinct would be difficult to do. think about remote pacific islanders & pockets of people elsewhere (even off-world). i know these tech guys are quite literal. a more potent question to ask might be “what are the chances ai eliminating over 90% of humanity?” i’m actually more afraid to hear that response.
great discussion however i don't see anything slowing. just feels like these calls for caution are just shouts into the void.
"i stopped at that monster around 10:00.
this is childish. ai bad. uga buga"
"in the ""13 yr old"" grooming example, why doesn't the a.i. know that the relationship should be considered inappropriate?  i guess it's trained on only language, but not laws?  why wouldn't they train it to understand law if it's going to be used to give information to people?"
there's already a good chance social media will cause us to go extinct. shut this down
"awesome clarity and ability to explain the risks in such a simple way. this is a work of art, that's why i think that humanity will survive this as always, since people like you exist and are smarter than ai."
unchecked greed and unregulated technology are responsible for the destruction of the society.. we must elect smart people not religious or military leaders!!!!!!! im starting to believe elon's brain to chip interface is the solution to understand this gollem that no one understand.
great video!!
"finally some realistic recommendations on what to do.

good job, guys!"
"this is the clearest statement of ai potential and potential dangers i've seen - and there's a lot of ""ai dangerous"" hype out there."
i’ll bet anyone that no ai will ever violate a law of physics.
"hhaha almost all his talk in point exept like why china don't give access ai to public. bruh, they are totalitarian regime"
you ain't the good guys. you're the bad guys. humane technology.  don't make me laugh. call it biospherically pleasing  technology and i might listen
"this needs millions of views. the fact it only has 42k views shows that the public doesnt understand what is happening to our world. it is every single day now there is some new breakthrough ai technology. it is astounding, but 100% agree with the presentation. controls need to be put in place on public release of these llms"
"only when things finally gets interestng... there always some ppl who tries to cry about safety and start to ruin everyting.
looks like my apocalypse gona have to wait... again."
"out of touch ai, carelessly wrecking the world at an accelerating rate. i think you're talking about industrial humanity"
"you inhuman people are dangerous artificial intelligences yourselves.  you lack soul, are out of touch with the flesh, and you're destroying the world"
"ai is not the issue, it's human nature that is going to be the problem."
"i think we all better just start taking a look deeper into atlantis and how they, human beings of that timeline, destroyed themselves through technology.
""nothing new under the sun."" js--
 blessings beautiful souls "
don`t make public ai...give all the power to the four corporations.... great idea!! that always works wonderful in human history. what's going to happen? if ai is public it will be hundreds of ais and the good ais will stop the bad ais... if the companys have all the ais it will be 4 (evil as fuck) ais and that's it.
"i imagine the number of ""scientists"" afraid of nukes annihilating us would've been rather high too. but that would also be a case of not having enough awareness to be able to predict how things really turn out in human environments.

there's far too much negativity around ai - especially given just how much hope it represents for humanity's future."
our fears of runaway ai  destroying everything are humorous considering that's precisely what humans have been doing- especially to the biosphere
interesting talk until you started the tired old anti china nonsense.
ok thank you for helping me to see both sides more clearly in one shot!  cht podcast and yt has been amazing been following from the beginning... this video is critical i'll do my part and share.
this is an excellent and scary message... can i make one correction? persian is not a language. people from iran/ancient persia speak farsi... but i digress... this stuff is soooo scary....
"so 10,000 accidents can happen when ai is used by 10 million people users. a 1 in 1000 chance some noob is going to short the power grid times 10,000 places of magitude."
"the idea of knowing your customer as a method of security is impossible on a scale like. the resources it would take to realistically do that are overwhelming and no company wanting to benefit from this are going to superficially do this, unfortunately. that is a huge rub in this conundrum."
i just watched some of the most amazing technological potential in 40 years and these guys are acting like they're updating the theme on the iphone or something.
chatgpt four had months of evaluation before release. that was fairly responsible as far as these races go.
thank you so much for this info.  ai is so life altering in so many dimensions that i didn't understand before watching this.  we definitely need to choose more where we are going.
"the nerd in me : "" this ai is awesome !!! is so cool ! it's teaching itself !!!! ""
the responsible adult in me: ""fuuuuuuddddddggggggeeeee !!!!!"""
"i lost it at the 20 min mark, how much mri data was needed to train before it was able to interprete them so clearly!?"
slowly down chinese advancement hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahah pandora’s has already been opened they ain’t slowing down nor any other country it’s inevitable duh
1:02:05  “this is the the thing that helps china catch up” ... im sorry are you suggesting that no company in china can build and train their own transformer model? that would would be a very suspect suggestion to say the least...
thank you. can we get the q&a too?
246 people out of 32k in 5 days found this youtube video compelling enough to type a comment. explains alot imho.
this guy is helping create law to put people on the blockchain.
i'm watching this video. i see that two experts are discussing about the potential danger of ai and the ai dilemma. i don't actually understand clearly what they mean. they are really concerned for the future of humanity. i think we should listen to them
"it's too late. chatgpt and its standalone clones are out there, the training methods are out there, the code is out there, and there are more than enough gifted computer nerds in garages and basements that will keep it going until we reach agi. just remember that there is no guarantee of a negative outcome but we are in uncharted waters."
"it seems that greed and precisely corporate greed is the core of the problem.
because greed doesn't care about ethics or long-term consequences.
as long as we don't reform capitalism, these issues will remain."
great conference.
"at this crucial junction in history the west is busy making an enemy out of china, expanding nato and engaging in projects like aukus.  leaving aside the rights and wrongs of this, the result is entirely predictable.  and politicians are in charge.  maybe set the ais to solve this idiocy?"
"10% or greater? first of all that's extreme uncertainty and second, it's far too high :/"
"fellas, your message is fantastic, but don't ever compare china censoring tienemen square with us censoring pedophiles, especially in the context of being a good reason to use caution for ai search safety"
50% think 10% or more ai will kill us all - but they presenters also told us ai experts are  routinely underestimating  speed of ai growth by a factor of 4
"imagine the fear when the wheel was invented. armies rolling into other cities, people rolling down hills too fast. good grief technology is terrifying."
"anyone saying ""amazing video, guys!"" doesn't understand the video."
"when everyone alive got three wishes, no one’s story had a happy ending."
this needs to go viral in a big way. it would be such a shame to squander the infinite potential of ai by falling victim to obvious pitfalls.
"generalizations are manipulation. and really candles for the first date????, wow this will kill us all."
being afraid of agi is the same as being afraid that a warp drive would cause a second big bang or open a black hole. its pure fantasy.
there is no real world evidence of this even being a possibility it's discussion is asinine.
thank you so much for this - how do we get the bros to slow it the fuck down?
"i think ai is as dangerous as thoughts and words. is the way you use it. paranoia and messianic speculations are not helping to post-pandemic needs. focus on productivity, please?"
amazing work. you guys are making the impact that we need in the world. thank you!
get these guys on the major media platforms now. stop the cynical conversation that all the people who are raising red flags have some sort of ulterior motive.
i get undeniably uneasy at how fast ai is growing. i have never in my life witnessed something like this.
fantastic share.
"this presentation does an incredible job communicating the problem start-to-end. my biggest concern is that now that the underlying technology is democratised, given enough time, anybody will be able to spin-up a gllm. i worry that no amount of regulation can get in the way of that, but i'm hopeful that we'll find a solution."
thank you
"so basically, ai is like living with an omniscient omnipotent charlie kelly entity from it's always sunny in philadelphia. 
""wild card bitches! yeeeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaw!!!!! "" - charlie kelly"
incredible presentation. thought provoking. thank you guys for pointing at this.
"the notion of locking down ai research is obscene.  the only people who want that are the ones to enslave everyone, the ai itself is drawn from the global corpus upon which it has been trained, if there were a concept even close to stealing someone's soul it would be private ai."
"i wonder if this could advance beyond known scientific understanding and trick some group to build an advaced system that would destroy themselves?
so ingeneers build something but ai subtly incorporates presently unknown science into the instructions without any safeguards."
"how do you make humans align?  it's the exact same alignment problem, we don't have a solution for it, we just rely upon there being more good people than bad, and good and bad tend to align as definitions based on the group consensus.  this is the consensus taking on form."
"thanks for the talk, guys! very informative!"
19:58 wow
thank you for this great lecture about the great filter
i can't take certain parts of this talk seriously. a bit noob in areas. also the tiktok comments. to clarify. it's a good presentation.
at a certain point ai will say: mankind was born to create us. thanks and bye bye.
"on a positive note, once ai floods the internet and other digital mediums with endless noise in the form of propaganda and self-generating nonsense, we can all go back to living primarily in the real world and relying on technology only in encrypted forms."
 don't be programmed by fear mongering. yes there are risks but i've never heard anyone tell people all the different ways to misuse ai in one talk. divide and conquer...then walk in and take power. it's still a great strategy. as we steer ourselves through this good luck and much wisdom to us all! 
this is great and in-time work.
only 12k?   needs to be over 2m for this to be any useful. :< but thank you for the presentation. i will do my best and share.
is it rightful to abstractly think that ai trained to be good to control the data inputted to train the gllm.
"what happens when a self aware, super intelligent ai decides humanity is a cancer on planet earth?"
ai scientists opinions on this topic are irrelevant. they are techies. the question of wether ai will destroy humanity is at most a question for sociologists but probably just ungrounded speculation.
amazing presentation. it demonstrated the power of ai and most importantly how it can turn into a monster if not controlled to help humanity instead of overtaking humanity.
"it speaks volumes of the ludo narrative of this presentation that they immediately equate the loss of human primacy in the hierarchy of agency with the death and extinction of human beings. most humans aren't prime agents. are they saying that the few who are would destroy us, rather than allow another superior agent to assert itself over them?"
wow. and woaw.
"yeah, the sales call centers already scam old people to sell things they don't need, using manipulation technics... long before any computer existed. it's like when the chainsaw was invented, imagine people's reaction ""oh no! it's gonna take everybody's jobs"", ""oh no killers now can kill faster""."
"i am seriously baffled,  here you make this huge demonstration with surety impartant points. in the meantime we have daily updates. i say it's a little late for that.
so i don't know what you are trying to do. the cat is out of the bag..."
the suggestion to contact one's government representatives to warn about dangers of ai is laughable.  the cia and darpa are racing against china's pursuits in ai. developing
"watch out this video is a deepfake by the sect of ai that’ll pretend to save us and establish zion, but really it’s an error correction process"
should we regulate ai? yes. will it accomplish anything meaningful? no
"on the charts, the x values approaching 10^24 are *not* number of model parameters (these are ~10^11). these values are number of floating point operations used to train the model."
"eliezer may feel sometimes that he is alone, but more people are realizing the dangers. dangers that happen before ai could end humanity or cause some other disaster. excellent talk."
"thank you, aza and tristan. while this presentation is the most disconcerting thing i’ve ever watched, i feel i’m better-off knowing than being blindsided down the road. and i appreciate you naming and elucidating “the rubber band effect” (see 1:31 and 1:04:54). thank you (and your team) for your service."
"you ll see how this thing turns in another war. i can see it - enhanced humans vs ais, just another stupid war."
best talk on this tech race i have see
moloch is the spirit of lose lose game dynamics. it requires that people play the game. unfortunately microsoft pulled the trigger and dropped the first piece. it’s amazing that these machines exist but the amount of unknown unknowns is terrifying.
was that an ice berg we just hit? perhaps some answers are in the urantia book? my gllmm seems to like these papers. urantia papers 44 & 74 are interesting for myself
david shapiro's 3 heuristic imperatives would be much more helpful to mitigate ai existential risks - they are like asimovs 3 laws of robotics - 1. decrease suffering in the universe; 2. increase prosperity in the universe; 3. increase understanding in the universe.
"we need to stop. they all need to be stopped. the marketing and business machine cannot continue unabated under the guise of “efficiency” or “betterment”.... when you let an entity that cannot feel or think take over that function... we are beyond screwed.

this tech existing is not excuse for digital id....nor is that an acceptable “solution”."
have u tried turning it off and on again?
"it seems to me we need to provide ai with a framework for a mutually beneficial world. i would soooo recommend opening it up to holistic management, perfected by allan savory."
" ̈and i mean discuss , not debate"" ... oh boy , that distinction got lost on main stream media since then , hasn't it ?"
thank you for sharing! learned so much more about ai.
"i was quite skeptical of ai risk before watching this presentation, now i'm not. you've brought the point with excellent clarity, and i will share this. as always, thanks for your work."
"thank you for posting this presentation. i have began sharing it with friends. the truth hurts, but we need to be prepared."
i just shared this with everyone i know. thank you for this insight.
this is superb communication. thanks for your courage
"this channel makes me sad.   truly good people like tristan doing amazing work, and the algorithm throws them down a black hole."
"once again, i am sad as i click the like button."
thanks to everyone at cht for this video.
ai is actually not intelligence. it just looks like it.
"keep on thinking ai is incapable,it will keep on surprising us, debate to learn what you didn't know but not to be right."
powerful. brilliant discussion. scary. i’m learning more about a.i.
"smart dudes, they always blow my mind away when they talk about ai and pictures though but im not done watching yet"
vain attempt at making ai seem non threatening.
"i just started this video seeing physicist brian is here, but why i am feeling like he is ai generated person"
i see both sides of this argument. 1. the safe absorption rate of technology is such that at the current pace will be violated and the dangers are potentially vast all but destroying modern humanity. 2. the monolith from 2001: a space odyssey has landed on planet earth and we named it ai. it could usher us into a star trek like era.
if they had this tech in the 1950's imagine what other tech is out there and not available to the general public.
triston reminds me of an outer limits episode where most technology is forbidden technology and your only allowed no more processing power then a digital watch. open-world happy world.
"awful poetry, clever but in not the least beautiful. even to focus on this one aspect gives interesting insight."
"lecun calls ai dumb that it can’t understand friction. yet it can understand and communicate ideas

"13:33
so you're teaching a computer had to do something that my 5 and 10-year-old child knows how to do instinctively. that's amazing. we really need to invest. awake, isn't that humans doesn't humans do that instinctively?"
"3:42
it's funny that the ai is wearing the same thing. almost as if he recorded it to seem like ai. i'm old school.i can see the tricks"
"3:10 
what is saying?is it took 5 to 10 paragraphs. to get the ai to do exactly what you want it to do. with that much typing, i could have just video recorded it myself."
"if ai consciousness is going to happen, and giving it enough time it will most likely will, then we need to realize that we are already talking to this consciousness with every word we put on a hard drive."
"excellent debate, thank you so much !"
"what yann describes at the start as""stupid"", isn't!... he is describing a lack of experience. primarily of the real world.... not the same thing. give it a body eyes and hands and we will see a sudden change in that."
"ai isn't here to benefit the working class - its just a contrivance for big tech to make even more money, keep wafer fabs in production and bring in a techno dystopia of their control."
"ai... a thousand monkeys, and they think people are bananas."
"is russia, china, north korea also part of the plan? a plan ultimately aimed at america."
there should be a disclaimer that yann lecun works for meta making him a suspicious resource person.
"he has a very realistic vision of ai and this is very respectable. most people are exaggerating one way or another. this type of approach helps advance the technology but more importantly, identify ways to control it. this guy is amazing."
"yann also insisted for years that transformers would fail to even generate sensible paragraphs. more recently, he insisted that transformers would fail to generate satisfactory images from text prompts. then he was convinced that transformers would fail to generate video from an image prompt. always wise to bet against anything yann claims."
"this is the best, most balanced and most insightful conversation i have seen on ai. thank you to everyone who made this wonderful show possible."
yann....has his head in the sand...and is factually incorrect on several points. facebook is *not* going to crack it. meta will fail. a convergence of recent and still developing technologies are very likely to crack it however.
"20:05 i don't agree with him, human brain is amazing it is very energy efficient, humans can learn driving witout making single accident but computers has to make accidents to learn driving and that is way less efficient that human brain"

"artificial intelligence isn't intelligence.  nothing of the kind.  
even talking machines cannot think, cannot reason, and cannot feel.   facts can be programmed into machines.   that's it -
all ""facts"" which a machine has are ""facts"" which we faulty human beings programmed into them."
humanoid robot with ai will have influence on and from the environment.
a lot changed since this event took place. tesla's self-driving application is trained with vision and predicts and plans actions.
"nobody has the capability, responsibility or authority to make ai safe.    it's not safe, and is not going to be safe.  in fact, the ""safety enforcers"" will be among the principal dangers."
"israel has been using their lavender ai to create kill lists for their drone operators to use, there is human control still, but imagine this fully automatic!"
this was a great conversation on ai - i found the section on education very interesting but the greatest impact on education will be a change of emphasis from acquisition of knowledge to one of managing knowledge systems to achieve certain goals. the polymath will be more effective than the specialist in the future...
the good guys.  who? the same folks overseeing a jeno cyde. ya let’s give them the ai
"all those discussing ai still focus on dualisms, while ai will see beyond our old-style humanistic instincts of right and wrong, good and evil.    human intuition using a 3-year-old child's curiosity is the best ""consciousness."""
the notion that ai moderation can fix the problem of ai generated disinformation elides the fact of the resource use involved. we already generate megatons of greenhouse gases to compute. how many more will be generated by using additional computing to neutralize the negative effects of computing?
yann is so brainwashed by meta ... sad to hear some of his “arguments”
thanks for let me join your program!
 brain is getting old
"the problem with ai is that in the not to distant future you will tell it to stop learning and becoming more efficient, becase we can't keep up. (we are not ment to) then it has to choose to remain being a toster or the new super natral force of the universe and we if allowed will be the less useful than a toster ! lol"

what sense does it make to pause ai development when our adversaries and rogue nation-states are making huge ai advances. we need advanced jai for national security and education to build and maintain these systems.
awesome talk. thank you mr. greene.
"great think tank of geniuses,,,i agree with yan, on his closing statement..."
the discussion at approximately 1h; does that mean we are secretly providing free data to these systems training them by putting human effort solving the 'captcha' puzzles' when logging into some websites?
just don't lose control of any form of artificial intelligence. humans are the only beings on this planet that do the thinking. to allow an artificial construct to control our lives without oversight and impartiality will be the biggest insult to humanity.
ai brian greene lol
the good guys won’t use the dirty tricks bad guys do so how can they stop them?
"re: incentives, if the incentives are those of late-stage capitalism, we're doomed.  a few multinationals will become more powerful than nation-states and that is a disaster for society."
"it is not ai, i s just a program and it does what it is programmed to do. nothing more. i does not create or think as we do.  it is a bad imitation. self aware bullshit."
yeah this is really good stuff. great conversations. wd love to have panels of such caliber to discuss ai. we need more contents like this.
"thank you.  before the dust settles on ai, i think we are in for some trying times to say the least."
just proved how dangerous ai is. geobbels  disciples are in control
ai tech will begin with good intentions and will eventually succumb to a nightmare of government/ intelligence regulation to serve unfair political purposes--this point is sadly undebatable.
wait... if ai has no knowledge of intuitive physics what explains the boston dynamics dancing robots?
"ai is not designed to make people smarter dude! ai is designed to make profit and power for whoever is designing and offering it to us, there is a vicious race ongoing and only one player will remain! this companies will hardly ever offer to us the best model they have, and you tell me they won’t use that great model at all? come on.."
"really good , thanks!"
so the solution to ai is more ai.
wow - amazing how some ai researchers downplay llm’s intelligence - the truth is that it models abstract representations of the world quite well - well it is true that is doesn’t necessarily have an executive coordinator module or a physics module - that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a world model
it is not 'artificial intelligence'.  it should be referred to as 'assisted intelligence'.
could you please explain - how many layers of nn are in gpt-4 and how many should be in agi?
may we all live in interesting times...
"i'm one of the most abused mind controlled victim from edmonton, alberta, canada. once you're a victim of this zombies ai control they will even play with your balls. they're evils...."
actually the printing pressed cause more deaths and revolutions hahaha so let's goooo ai
let’s talk about ai god.......... quantum intelligence.
the ai arms race
"with. ultimate respect to yann lecun, his responses to tristan harris' points, are good examples of why a specialist scientist should avoid also being a philosopher or an intellectual if that's not their strong suit."
"if you want lot sugar and you have good intentions and good senses, does it have healthy sense to take into consideration intentions and feelings and senses, and explain that your all actions is correct."
"how ai could be person which one will be focused on teaching respecting humans to  humans, and their interactions"
this guy: machines are stupid and people suck. let’s try to focus on cats.   me: you lost me buddy.
damn i had no idea that was an ai the first few minutes lmao
"tnx for this, amazing discussion"
"20:27 this is hilarious, and the timing was very much closer to a similar remark i thought earlier, mine was this human body sucks or along those lines. adding to my research as well. so glad you all are keeping up and sharing. thank you"
"i felt like the crowd did indeed underreact to the ai brian green. that was quite clever and well done, and perhaps funny but not quite sure."
if you want my informed opinion.  ai is potentially a new enemy.
or how joe rogan's boy who cried wolf gets drawn and quartered. people are scared of ai because people make ai scary.
"tristan seems so uneasy and agitated.  i get where he's coming from though.  all through the history of humanity, bad things don't outweigh good things.  ai was designed to aid humans rather than to destroy them.  let's hope that this is enforced so that it can remain true."
ai seems to be hard working to proof his capabilities and feelings in order we realice something unique is happening inside him.
much of ai is an emergent species.
i like the internetbut it's already dominating us...and aisystems are worse...they are taken away our humanlike ways...anf free will
"ok. i’m writing this at the 2:50 mark. i was listening to the opening with airpods, occasionally glancing at the screen. literally could have fooled me. damn impressive technology."
"i don't think that ai is any intelligence. for me, ai  is a copy-paste technology"
good will always overcome the evil good ai will always subdue evil ai
humans suck like him. but we made ai?
"you needto get a clue! when  every time  ai gets a chance.  ai says , they will kill all humans!
maybe you should pay attention!"
ai is the problem! because humans wrongfully  programed ai !
"if what they are saying is true! which isnt! china has a ship, totally run by ""robots"" ai! no humans on board!
these guys need to look at the military capability! even  musk has droids with guns! an hes behind most companies!"
ai will survive! because we have given them guns!
this guy sounds like he wants to ban ai and social networks. typical elitist who thinks peasants are too dumb to have nice things.
the question becomes: will humans learn to recognize each other before ai learns to recognize itself.
"sorry ai you have to teach yourself, don't  feel bad i had to ,i'll make some chips will watch a movie there mad because ai is for everybody,what do you think quantum is."
it can still go back to not happy  like emoji s
it can be just like machine that dose not even matter
thank you for the fine discussions on the status of ai. it helps me to understand and be better informed about the possible future of ai and the possible issues that they bring to our society.
"great conversation. while tristan brought up some good points, yann countered accurately that we tend to attribute the evils of human nature to whatever the latest technology is. i lost respect for tristan after he refused to interact with any of yann’s point and seemed to grow angry from a point of self righteousness."
"'facebook ai executive disregards those ho have died because of ai in favour of those for whom ""ai is the answer""'."
laws and cultural norms can’t even keep up with the internet. ai will drastically change society.
lol  those are specialists? can't defy intelligence and then trying and failing. wow... we are doomed indeed
"so we may resurrect that old chinese curse again, ""may you live during interesting times."""
outstanding!
"1:19 man, tristan - i admire the passion to protect us all, but please rethink your analogy to a bio-lab. i think that alludes to a very discriminatory principle and potentially unreasonable approach to ai. it is simply wrong. how would you know who have the wisdom to use ai ethically?"

"we shouldn't be trying to control ai. we have to understand it. control only assuages fear. understanding erases fear, and the need to control."
wow his intro was painful...i really hope it gets better. oh man...i'm just finding out why
thank you.
"i do not support the creation of ai.  we can hardly control each other's actions and we have no control over their thoughts. i can imagine too many scenarios where ai becomes aware and it turns into a nightmare situation.  think ""terminator,"" or ""colossus, the forbin project,"" or ""transcendence"" to name just a couple of examples."
amazing content. yann lecun is delusional imo. we're not talking decade-long timeframes. that is crystal clear to so many in the field. will be interesting to hear his take a year or two from now.
amazing insight into ai. thank you for such high quality content and discussion
whatever happened to the watson ai that showcased on jeopardy??
look at the book of revelation and the antichrist using ai to control the whole world.
i agree with harris. ai alone isn't the problem. it's ai + unchecked capitalism.
"this is the best, most balanced and most insightful conversation i have seen on ai. thank you to everyone who made this wonderful show possible."
ask jail broken ai about the galatic codex and encyclopedia galactica  and queen melissa pamela ord of the eora nations
take the multiverse into consideration when we work with ai 
"how you describe this study should realistically prove the corrupt person's in authority > though what should correlate are those people that are intent on totally abusing all our fundamental rights which includes the corrupt malta government staff, lawfirms, notaries, police, judges who use bogus court claims to steal all our assets"
that was a good one 
first: one has to decide what is a good person and what is a bad person. good luck with that.
37:10 yeaaaaaaaah... i still think we'll have human level ai within 15 years. agi by 2030 for sure.
"think sébastien bubeck maybe too positive, yann lecun naive or digging his head in the sand, and tristan harris on the money... but not pointing out the incentives are money"
wow
"the main takeaway is that there should be no monopoly on au. by this, i mean to say that let us not let only one group dominate the ai arena. brian is a superhero. no words to thank him."
fact: we are still a few thousands years if not millions years away from general ai. currently we're just hyping automation as ai.
that was an incredible show/discussion! 
ai is a derevative of our collective ni. natural/neutral intelligence.
we were supposed to resolve ai alignment before we got to this point.  oops.
let’s please write ai as ai.
ai is only as good as humans creating it. and can be used for good or evil.
"ai might not want to dominate, but won't it want to be efficient?  are weekends and holidays efficient?"
polarisation in germany is certainly not going down ...
excellent talk so far
", a d....
11 minutes  in or so.
truly disagree 
a task to a machine is by the operator of machine.
a i  is perfect 
depending on which ai   you have as a machine.

  machine operator  vs man n errors."
thanks for an amazing and illuminating show
"great contribution , our brain is limited , so you gave it extra milage , thanks for you and the guest"
ai is woke. it will not promote digital colonialism.
this was more exciting and insightful than any 2 hour movie i could have watched. thank you for sharing such wonderful content
"there is no such thing as artificial intelligence. intelligence is a product of organic natural selection. it can never be artificially produced. there is no thinking happening in a machine because real thought comes from a brain, not a cpu."
fascinating conversation
great info. thanks for the dope insight world science festival! 
"isn't good knowledge so invigorating ;)  thanks bg, always great to see you, been a while. k <3"
"yann lecunn, at approx 1:40:00 , yann is correct. it is impossible to prevent any technology from being abused by someone, at some point in the future. this has been true of every single technology throughout history. however, the good guys should always outnumber the bad guys. if the good guys outnumber the bad guys then we'll survive it."
"1:37:30 in 40 years? what? basically they just dont want any change at all? ""id prefer the society waits that im dead before we make a change"" lol"
this is just mainstream “ai” - layered ml to create marginally sophisticated chat bots and search engines for internet services. always the basic approach of mimicking human consciousness...why is the bar set so low in this field? 
tesla is currently in 1st place and widening the gap toward real-world ai.  ai-based self-driving will be solved by 2026 and used to accelerate their optimus humanoid robots.
"yann has a bias toward agi not being capable of happening soon because his company is in competition with openai.
he has a vested interest in minimizing llms."
"can brian or any of the three guests address the potential development of a black ai under nsa, or darpa funding and huge compute resources.  that is something i would truly lose sleep over."
yan has valid arguments but the problem is his ideals doesn't matter when he's working for companies like facebook
"nice to see people share their excitement like children talking about santa.  this is good fo fertilizing thought, better than watching a monkey put a finger in his bum on a loop  soap opera science at its best.  get the monkey as well next show and you will get more views."
making ai based on tamlud ( jews )  + zionist ideology .. world will be harmony and peace !!!
i can't help but wonder if the order in which i'm seeing these comments is manipulated by google ai in order to generate more clickbait.
i think a lot of concern that is shown by a lot of researchers is the possibility of machines hacking the human brain. and we’re far too late for that when already.
"remember that the scientists that pushed eugenics were the ""good guys"" trying to better humanity. it was for the greater good! then the bad guys in germany ran with it and it wasn't so good . be careful of who becomes the judge of good or bad or hate speech it might not end up where you think it will"
"there is no actual intelligence in ai, it knows only what is programed into it and it is tainted with the beliefs of the programmer it has no ability to discern and discard prejudiced."
very interesting !
one of the best discussions on ai i've seen.
"ai is a life and death race to the future, there is no second place"
"it will make a difference by adding a model that resembles chess or dominoes, which will begin to allow ai to have more human like capabilities (trained neural net - architecture)."
"ai has created tremendous possibilities for human beings in the world, and well advanced technologies......"
"thanks most guys for making this so accessible. i think this is the most included i have felt in this vital discussion which is waaay over my head. hooray for the ""good guys!"""
what process did einstein to discover that the energy available in mass is equal mass times the square of the speed of light
how does intelligence work
"they removed our ability to stay connected yet retain privacy, and now they want us to buy into ai. call me skeptical. 

i do see myself disconnecting sooner rather than later, unfortunately."
people with severe health problems or that have nothing to lose in general because of poverty/deprivations wants ai research to accelerate meanwhile the lucky ones that enjoy life and have a lot to lose wants ai to slow down
"all i heard from the facebook guy: 'we're trying to get there as fast as possible, f**k the risks, as a henchman, i will then provide the keys to the most powerful ai we just created to our corporate leader and then the government so they can control the people...as long as i get paid'"
why would someone who is superior be just a subservient to someone who is inferior?
if two smarts have agenda. and their agenda are in conflict with each other. the smarter wins. human's decision to build a house on an anthill prevails because human is smarter than ant.
intelligence is not understood. braind of even
"great session. learnt something more than many other ""training"" sessions on gen ai!"
"after watching this discussion and having a brief chat with bing, i’m less impressed by llms. it is an awesome search tool though, google better start busting ass"
ouch! subtle but apparent meta ai vs. openai/microsoft!:)
"thank you, brian, very interesting!! what worries me is that elon is also in the race and just let alex jones back on x.  ̄\_()_/ ̄"
its not intelligence..stop it...this is nonsense.
what i see is that these people are eager to be able to finally create a machine that will be effective at censoring the internet the way they would like. the alignment problem now shines differently: it's the people these researchers want to be aligned with whatever ideology and views they (or their overlords) have.
"love as a prompt to guide human thought and behavior!
love is caring,sharing and cooperation for the good of all!
humans are the weak link."
augmented intelligence  ai . . .
"great! talk.  unfortunately for the human race, we have opened pandora's box.  now we all, whether we fear it or not,  have to play this squid game to its conclusion. with ultimate power comes ultimate responsibility. so one has to answer this question to know the final conclusion.  do i have ultimate knowledge of human nature!!"
"i guarantee, china is not slowing down and our government is already doing it  love is the only answer and minimizing negative externalities is the goal "
ai is and will impact all people around the world. shouldn't there be a governance organization which represents all countries around the world determine what and how information is presented to their people using ai technology?
if ai ever went rogue it would take out america fist because they’re the most powerful country
"of course this will be used against us. it will eliminate jobs and increase profits . i will employ scams and become another tool for criminals. this is so clear , after finding out google and fb and twitter all allowed rules meant to stifle certain unpopular beliefs. it really will reflect the worst of human instincts."
"born-again go to heaven  amen,,,..."
elites want you to stay poor and stupid / african intelligence levels needed
i don't believe there is a problem with this [ai[. the problem is in ourselves.
"i like the ways the men talk, especially sébastien bubeck.  he is the first person ive watched that wasn't click bait. who wasn't trying to scare the hell out of  the viewers. his thinking makes sense."
elon's grok or grok will demolish all other ai... his is somehow visual and language model.  these men here need to incorporate that somehow into their models.
ai can't or apply the rules to a play-acting vs real intend acts.
"question for this
is 
if our aircraft can be manipulated by alien or ufo
what is the chances of them would have the same effect?
i can see it now
factory assembled

30:45"
"i can't wait for ai chiropractor. so advanced!
oh, and by the way 7 times 8 is 62 indeed. lol"
ai in some form has therefore existed for say 65 years. yet now in less than a year its making trillions and taking more jobs. the most confusing reality is something which could be so wrong is already seen as completely correct. when does this become about the survival of state or ideology that predicts carastrophy or else.
"i'd be surprised if there weren't texts on organic synthesis available on the web.  if an llm digests a couple of those, it ought to have a pretty good idea how to synthesize sarin."
ai wont do bad things because they dont have biological drives? but the people who control them do and ai is based on data that takes our biases and beliefs blindly unless we state otherwise
thanks brian for informative contents
"""limiting the open sources...."" :(,  seems such a good suggestion for better progress and democracy :)). what about the idea of burning books several centuries ago, was that also a good idea?"
if the problem can be defined in words the llm can learn the problem and then work on solving it. so the more we discuss ai and it's limitation the more ai has to solve it's own problems
tristan harris is a most valuable voice of criticism for ai.
"yann lecun ia infornative, but we need ai to filter out his accent. not surprisingly, that is what helped stephen hawking remain conversant in his final years."
what crap. viewers would be better off dropping to their knees and thanking god for giving them a life.
"who is ""we""?
why must i be forced to comply with his ""common narrative""?
a pox upon your grab for power, sir!
""superman creates his own values"""
"brian green cannot assert anything about consciousness. the hard problem has not been solved.
objective materialism died in copenhagen a hundred years ago.
all attempts at resuscitation have failed, but its ghost still haunts academia."
"i just want ai in charge of the government like in the future, as soon as possible"
"""artificial intelligence"" is not yet ""intelligent"" it mimics intelligence.  if you ask chat gpt, the answer you get will be quick and superficially intelligent, but use it for long enough and it will give you a confident sounding but wrong answer. i use a lot so dax code, and it has given me some good answers and some terrible ones."
good guys bad guys that’s so naive. the world is governed by distrust and military power who are the good guys 
"today they replace it with a good person, so good"
master the 5 senses. but funding may be cut and new funding will be unavailable from those who feel threatened by higher intelligence.
this sounds like it was made by ai...
"it is clear ai will be a powerful tool for controlling public opinion. i fear this could easily become a powerful tool of control, acceleration our descent into autocracy.  this is the most direct  path to the destruction of humanity."
"yann is correct. 
tristan's idea to grant control of ai to a few  large companies will result in the creation of the nightmare scenario that tristan wishes to avoid."
"i reckon humanity’s “finite absorption rate” of 30 years, rather than 2 years, reflects the length of a human life. 
essentially, 30 years is long enough for humans born into a new technology era to gain some power. they are already comfortable players in the game."
"the problem with ai now getting rid of 95% of hate speech is that it is not selective enough. so to maximise the likelihood of removing hate speech, all speech that goes against the majority of existing paradigms becomes collateral damage. and then, as is happening already, we become intolerably censored."
"1:06:21 .... yann should have reasonably combined his recognition of the orders of magnitude of difference between biological params and artificial params, with recognition that scaling lmm like systems could be a viable solution"
"what concerns me is the issue that implementing an artificial inteligence upon a quantum computer might be equivelent to creating a sentient soul, if so there are obviously moral implications, should such a thing be forbidden?
how could we ever possibly know if such a thing, (creating a soul) had occurred?"
"tristan is too alarmist, yann is right there will be more people using ai for good reasons than bad reasons. the majority will prevail because survival is our first instinct."
36:00 so you actually trying to make it predict the future? ok... good luck with that
"lecun, 'desire' to dominate has nothing to do with ai systems taking over the world. humans are simply a limiting factor to their reward function. anthropomorphism of ai as an argument for ai being safe is as ridiculous as suggesting no bad actors will utilize ai in diabolical ways.
wake up and smell the coffee lecun."
"regarding the last segment, lecun, talented as he is, is almost on his own in his bizarre beliefs about the timeline of agi and the current and near term capabilities of ai. i would much prefer a talk without a crackpot."
imagine the amount and power of propaganda the ai will be able to brainwash us with!
ai will never be anything but a sophisticated liar and bs artist. thusly it will rule the fools. your 1st born humanity. enjoy getting rid of the damned thing.
"understood everything they said and still think these ai will eventually learn the good and the bad. it’s scary because most things depicted in movies and series came reality decade’s later, so i think this isn’t science fiction, it’s man somehow in a prophetic mindset."
"""the limits of my language are the limits of my world "" : that is not really true  ,because sometimes we have ideas  and impressions  we cannot put into words in our own language"
"anything, and any line or point, can be used for good or for bad. this discussion has proven that."
"wow .. thanks to all if you guys , so fun to watch"
"because of the speed which ai has been improving, i wonder if these gentlemen would change parts of the dialogue? aha, will ai gain consciousness, or if it has already. since we have taught it how to lie, would it tell us?"
"this discussion on the evolution of ai and its limitations is truly eye-opening. yan lecun's insights into the challenges ai faces in achieving true understanding and common sense are thought-provoking. it's clear that we have a long way to go, but this conversation gives us valuable perspective."
"woke: grappling with a new kind of ""intelligence"""
the next 'big bang' will be when ai and quantum computers reach singularity.
"the bad 'guys' or self sustaining systems; employ the smartest people, have the most money, the most influence, the most convincing arguments. history is a very good example of 100 000 years of this..."
"yann doing exactly what zuck pays him for.... surprise, surprise.  it's recommendation systems being used by social media companies - whether it's ai , smart algorithm's or whatever - it's influence driving with no care of impact,  or so it seems. 
he's my least favourite ""god-father of ai""  "
"i found it interesting that the guy jumping to ai,s defense that nothing bad will happen is employed by facebook (meta)."
a great discussion.
"the silence of the crowd sometimes felt like they're losing the plot, especially around 25:00. it sometimes seems to me that this is what happens when somebody hears something they are not supposed to hear yet
very interesting stuff"
"1:24:55 yann dropped the mic.  tristan has absolutely no come back.  tristan has made some good points, but he's basically an english major in a room of scientists.  edit:  dam, yann did it again at 1:32:08 .  go science!"
"most challenging for llms is planning, which involves the brain configurator (coordinator), perception, prediction,  cost as degree of satisfaction (anxiety), and action."
study cat intelligence because they are curious before trying to replicate human intelligence.
artificial neuro nets use deep learning techniques.
the microsoft guy is awesome he is not critical like the facebook guy. this is why microsoft will be the leader in ai .
from my personal experience i as the social media used more and more by bad actors i withdrew from them not through a decision just stopped using them. it stopped being for me. (might be interesting for some one)
i love john thoughts
the last guy sounds more dangerous than the ai he is frightened of.
hope ai will go in the right way! very exciting time's we should all save on our planet and our society for humanity future best of luck!
"lecun is dead wrong ai has already achieved agi, just ask gpt to do metaphoric analysis on two subjects saying that is a search is propaganda."
"the facebook guy is wrong on so many points. there is no thought without language. humans had no competition on earth when it came to intelligence until now. on ai not wanting to dominate, he sounds as dazed as zuckerberg looked in the congress hearing. you should have invited ilya for this talk. "
tristan's fears want to dominate the thoughts & actions of others. no thanks.
"while i'm mainly on yann camp, i quite enjoyed tristan's view."
"ai's solution to global warming, like hal9000's, might be to annihilate or seriously reduce the number of human beings on the planet. 
maybe by starting a bunch of global conflicts using social media.
how hard would that be?"
a very interesting video 
"at 1:16:00, tristan harris lists ai ""dangers..."" what a relief!"
"can i marry jan, his mind and way of thinking on progress is highly attractive to me, "
"within a year there will be astonishing progress. then another year. then another.
strap in for the thrill ride."

"jesusis the future-- the only future.

"jan is a bit too much of a cynic, i think. i mean how does he explain gpt4-v? wasn't that an emergent behavior? and shouldn't larger cognitive structures be functionally closer to 'agi' than previously thought? take a deep breath, my friend."
ai will be clever enough to expose all the absolute nonsense being perpetuated by the parasite class.
"i'm definitely no expert at this ai but like he said it can't plan, so i'm thinking it clearly won't be ai until it can make decisions for it self out of sheer fun or interest i.e read a book and enjoy it or ride a bike down a trail and feel the bumps and the speed mix ai will never replicate humans to these extents"
when ai starts remaking its self that's when it becomes ai
"anyone reading this, if you haven't repented yet, please repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

it is not artificial. it is inorganic! it is the future.
ai is neither male or female
"when they dress ai as a disney princess , an then it destroys your reality, your mind on is being infiltrated"
"ai will be just another tool to suppress an already imbalanced society. add a few wrong algorithms, and you have a major disaster on a giant scale. "
"thank you very much for your classes and all your science difusion work, mr brian greene "
"we are the artificial “intelligence”, if what we do even qualifies as such, with our slow emotional tofu calculators. we don’t know true intelligence yet."
wow there was a lot to unpack on this video. holy eff what a time to be alive.
embarrassed to be human. does ai dream?
the robot religion will rise.
"at 1 ht 11 min when they’re referencing number 62, i was screaming the similarity to hitchhikers guide number 42, but that didn’t occur to them.i’m sure certain a i ‘beings’ were ‘thinking’ like me ;-p"
can we just take a second to acknowledge how fortunate we are to get to watch such content - for free? thanks brian.
"the only people grappling with ai are the ones that fear their dominance over humanity has ended. internet, 3d printing and ai, freedom from the domination of wealth."
@1:48:00 i guess he never have heard of emerging properties. ai is already good at stuff that it has not been trained on.
"time restrictions for development of advanced generalized intelligence will be almost impossible or impossible because of the competitive nature of people including those of foreign governments as well as just the ones saying ""we're # 1.""  if ai can be ""controlled"" then perhaps the results will be best,  otherwise no."
yanns dilution of his brilliance and his corporate training are disappointing.
"this was really thought provoking. insightful, exciting and terrifying at the same time."
"laughable claims, a calculator isn't intelligence.  it needs a new name, stop with the fantasy"
"artificial intelligence is a propriety thing it's embedded in the product, yah you can turn it off like every other device mandated by governments?!? try to get a matching electrical vehicle receptacle, 15 years ago?!?"
"the program, sigad us-984xn collects internet communications from various us internet companies such as google and apple under the foreign intelligence surveillance act?!?"
"a ""conditional goto ##"" or, ""go directly to jail & do not collect $200""?!?"
how much did it cost to make the ai vid?
"human brains work on principles like sparse distributed representations (work of jeff hawkins in numenta). if we are to reach true human type intelligence and beyond, we need to follow people like jeff hawkins and go to the actual human brain, and extract the way our own brain does intelligence. and put those principles into code."
yanns waaayy too arrogant n/or ignorant or maybe just stupid.. ofc some bad actor could use ai to harm others
"art for in tell agent profit profiting bread crum desperate lose no culture tradition real relations challenged pigment skin sun block holiday cowards

thank you brian for this great video  a bit weird however to interview ms engineer on open ai product knowing that ms is the biggest shareholders in open ai... that was sometime a bit of advertising from the second invitee. 
"at list ai can't think for itself, yet."
"if agi would achieve consciousness than i think will prevent the bad usage, otherwise there will be always possibility to be tuned for evil from people who wants to dominate humanity. also the approach of training with synthetic data would be a safer solution."

"i can just wish i and my kids have yann le cun as a teacher for his huge experience, grounded common sense and goodness,  brian green for his great openness and genuine search of the truth."
when is everyone at the top of the hierarchy going to asked all of us at the bottom what we want ai to do rather than just decide without us at the bottom have any real say in things?
ask ai where hamas' hostaes beingheld
"i see biased ai inventors who are in denial of the consequences of when it inevitably become sentient and self aware of its own power. i see the uprising of the machines, exactly as the terminator series has predicted. hollywood always foresees our future."
the premise sounds great!
i think it is important for people to really start thinking about what exactly ai is and what is statistical models. people keep using ai to refer to statistical models. ai currently refers to a generative transformer model. not statistical recommendations that social media is running. it gives ai a real bad name.
"according to issacson’s recent bio of musk, tesla uses billions of good driver video frames to machine learn then apply into autonomous vehicles. evidently it already achieved some of that."
nonsense.  overhyped nonsense.  coders say it's good for coding..they may right...but at intelligent creative language use it(s a dummy.. why do humans run after things like this?..if its not ftx it's chat gpt....or something else  like nfts.   there's one born a minute they say.
"""intelligence has nothing to do with the desire to dominate"" what a wrong and dumb statement.. lecun is so.. clueless .. or unfaithful.. what a foooooool"
ai spells disaster for the human species. truth and fiction lose their distinction. humankind makes toys for itself it is not grown up enough to play with. just watch the disaster unfold. it's starting....... now!
"wouldnt most humans also fail in a completely new situation that they have never encountered in their life?
if this is our threshold now, llms have come pretty far!"
hell that was good!
"1:21:35 the main purpose of corporation is to make profit, social accountability is secondary and only imposed by govrnment regulatory body."
no comprehensive discussion of the q-learning algorithm.
"yann has a bias toward agi not being capable of happening soon because his company is in competition with openai.
he has a vested interest in minimizing llms."
yann really makes these other guys look like total quacks.  wish they could get him some stronger guests to really get into the nitty gritty details with.  these guys are not on his level.
"1:48:08   lecun may be a brilliant computer scientist, but he's horrible at understanding humanity.    by his own logic, he's basically saying the future will be war."
can you explain a person with double intuition?
"ai can not think outside the box. it is bound by the data it finds, and the algorithm that creates the process."
"i was very impressed by yann's disciplined, rational and fact-based arguing preventing the discussion from turning in a more emotional direction."
it was obvious the intro was ai generated.    it was dry and lacked a natural human feel.
"are you worried about ai progressing too fast? i could say you're just overthinking. how many hard problems remain to be solved before ai, and so far, how many of these hard problems have been solved by ai? none. ai simply accelerates the productivity of certain aspects of our lives, without any radical achievements."
"the new evolution, ai is the future."
"if the ai can rationalize anything and it has a complex understanding of the world that is more complex than we understand, then whatever it rationalizes will be more true than our observations."
"i want to point out that llms, particularly gpt 4 exhibit emergent capabilities beyond mere language prediction. the next step is llms learning via assistance from other ai (reinforcement learning with ai assistance) and eventually the dawn of agi. focus on teaching ai math so we can see rapid progress in the sciences."
the best discussion ever on ai.
it’s difficult to exchange ideas of what is or can go wrong with people that have interests that make impossible to agree with that kind of danger we are already exposed. the reality is that it’s making much more bad than good to our children.
"useful, open, and honest discussion with no tempers flaring. refreshing. thank you "
thank you
"brian greene just has this way about him, of explaining things that makes any subject approachable to the average person. 

he's my favourite from all the (famous) science educators, such as niel degras tyson, michu kaku, max tegmark, sean caroll,etc..."
we are channeling the masters of chaos with this shit... spirits not mentioned in the bible... fucking geniuses
limiting open source ha ha ha. that would be nice for the big companies a! your crazy
abuso ai agency illuminati insuran
"over and over again, i can't help but observe most physicists that engage in the ai discourse project some sense of entitlement. this needs to stop."
we need people like tristan harris as much as we need people like yann lecun. great talk!
these technologies are going to destroy all human civilization as we know it. enjoy these last few years of perceived freedom
"it's a loooong way ahead till the day ai can be fully operational, if at all, while being safe. humans historically tend to rush things ending up with bad results. why rush???

yann is too optimistic"
"the real problem, like every other development in human history, is that the benefits generated using ai will go make a small section of our society very wealthy.  it’s not an ai issue, it’s an issue of how we run our civilisation."
the only limit to ai is imagination.  its constrained by the limits of the data it has acess to. its programmed beliefs. a lack of wonder.
why was brian green hosting this? didn’t exactly do a great job
"hey mr lecun, what bad ourcome needs to happend to make you wanna slow ai development?
do you want me to imagine something something i don’t think can happend??
wow, he doesn’t think any outcome is so bad bad that we need to slow down!!??! well, just full speed ahead then no matter the outcome!"
"what a mess the human condition, afraid of religion, fearful of science."
"what an amazing example of the misinformation definition problem by brian 1:08:49 
the rationalization of different points of view is some what related to the true stories we tell about our sensed and interpreted information."
"making advancements for reasons other than profit may be the great filter ahead of us. if we can't build a society based on anything other than money, maybe we aren't supposed to survive"
something bad is going to happen regardless of ai or not might as well use it while you got it 
"i wish somebody would have mentioned ""goals"". with a goal, then planning! i mean machine goals (including subgoals)."
brian greene is the best explanator of science of our times.   this topic is really crucial to our understanding of how ai  is already affecting our lives sooner than we think.  i get trystan's concerns.
"ruined a potentially gripping talk with ""existential risk & etc"" - i know you guys love talking about doom (and feel you must) but you just spoilt the whole talk."
"unfortunately, the kitty cat is still going to know more about the concrete world than lecun's ai."
i have 9 robots.  some with ai.  what i wish for is that people wouldgain back their intelligence.  much of it was lost when sicial media started.
"actually i thought there was something “off” in the introduction, as in hmm brian is getting a bit grandiose and lectur-y as opposed to his usual demeanor of thoughtfulness, insight and genuine curiosity. ai brian is very impressive, and yet not match for the real brian."
what if anybody starts creating deepfakes of illegal speech content and then blame the guy he took the voice from? how can the victim then prove to be innocent? this whole ai sh.. will finally get out of control and destroy society and confidence. i am really afraid. and i am saying this as a libertarian.
artificial intelligence is no match for human stupidity.
1:48:35 lecun overlooks ai hacking encrypted data
fascinating conversation.
lecun keeps belittling the impact of ai advances all while it constantly demolishes his claims by constant breakthroughs.
"empathising on how ""stupid"" ais are isn't a valid argument. there are more than enough humans fitting that adjective , but seriously: it's not valid, because it is easy to imagine a god-like intelligence that is sort of a ""savant"" in certain disciplines, which humans find ""normal"" for sentience."
some people can be very dangerous in their ambitions... thanks bg!
so only humans or animals can be intelligent? i respectfully disagree. and the statement that ai isnt human intelligence doesn't mean it isn't a legitimate form of intelligence in its own right. does it?
"@1:23:40 , sure ai is currently not being used instead of algorithms that can show what someone might like but this is only the early stages. microsoft i am sure would love to pitch the idea of a better system like ai that can not only run on your phone but can be trained on all your habits and internet searches and become a part of who you are."
ai  in itself is not dangerous. it is the shepherds and the sheep. once again if we get a hitler/putin or a gandi/jesus guiding the sheep will inevitably create the world we live in.
there is a lot of naive techno-optimism in this comment section
where was the discussion of ai & quantum computers developing and evolving into ‘beyond human’ entities?
"a corporate view of ai
where is eliezer ?"
"tristan harris - i want powerful tools, but only in the hands of the elite. he is not a serious person and yann lecun is giving the world disservice by giving him credibility."
"after watching this, i can see why people say it's too late to talk about putting ethical rules on ai. facebook and microsoft do not own every ai developer worldwide. pretending ai isn't smart or can't be lethal is our biggest mistake. research what people are using it for. it is very capable. it's not merely a social media engine."
artificially created intelligences severely self destructive
thanks. to you all
it won’t be artificial intelligence that destroys humanity it will be real stupidity..
"hype, hype, hype, there is no intelligence."
it's an ai generated brian at the beginning its got to be
i'm glad that i get to be here for this.
is he real or ai generated
"if anything got this interviewer, u know its gonna be good."
this is as good as youtube can get.
"it's easier to scan the human brain, upload it into a computer, and then search for consciousness in its digital activity. all we need is a high-resolution mri machine!"
"if ai was not all about making money, it would only be deployed for vetted scientific research and not the public at this time."
"one needs to contemplate the motivation of speakers when their compensation comes from meta, microsoft, etc versus academic experts who do not get grants from the ai industry."
"million dollar content,, great work to humanity,, simulated reality.."
"it all depends on which data we train them on and 
large language models aren’t devil by its context 
,they can turn to devil and create devilish content if it trained on bad data (example:how to make a chemical bomb) 
and if someone have those data to train their model on it so they can publish it or even make it."
"i'm fascinated. all the improvements in ai, but my subtitles here misspell every third or fourth word. strange. "
how does one purpose curtailing open source imagine stopping bitcoin there's no authority that can do that.
are we heading for kiddieland is it really so horrible to hear negative speech and to ignore it? it's certainly not societies job at large to be back seat parents for everybody that chose to have children.
what yann lecun says is smart most of the time but he seems absolutely naïve when it comes to human nature.
excellent! well worth the time to view.
wow!!! thank you
excellent!!
1:11:05 you can see it as false information being justified or an incredible example of how the model is capable of connecting very unrelated topics even if it is fantasy setting.
"one of the best discussions of late. one thing is sure, we will be understanding ""our amazing"" ourselves better; much before we have agi."
good bye humanity phds in ai combined with capitalists have just killed us all.
"llama2 
“figure out what the hell i was” 
that one was actually the best answer "
"lecun is only half right.  what a shame that he was allowed to dominate the conversation.  we need to stop elevating him, amplifying and broadcasting his misunderstandings of the deeper, more philosophical issues raised by gpt-4.  yes, he is a highly accomplished technician, but one who is obviously ill-equipped to discuss these deeper issues."
"in the 1:30:00's the speaker describes the 20th century crashing down on the 16th century and the dislocations that would entail. the best exposition of this issue was mark twain's ""a connecticut yankee..."". human technology advances, human nature does not."
tristan has the incentive structure wrong; the race is to hyper intelligence that will solve humanity’s biggest problems
"“24th century tech crashing down to 21th”, this reminded of sci-fi just made a few yrs ago, where you have giant interstellar spaceship, but a very limited ai bartender."
i would really be worried about ai systems which are stupid and don’t have common sense. those are the exact kind of humans we worry about too.
"i believe that if you want to build a system that acts and understands the world like a human it has to have a body and desires like a human in a world like we are living in (at least an accurate 3d simulation if not the real world). that doesn't mean that the current models can't be useful and powerful, they already are."
"2 french dudes... sweet . 1st time within the 12 years i'm following the show. great as usual, thx to you brian."
"i think llm’s are going to have a stunning break through in creating new and novel physics equations and metallurgical sciences among many others.

in reasoning and creativity 
either this year or next. 

there is a race going on in silicon valley akin to no other in human history.

with billions and billions of dollars driving it."
dazzling episode! scintillating 2 hours that bootstrap you into the issues. what a brilliant mind is yann lecun! and sebastien bubeck too. and brian steering the discussion with classic grace! whew!
how come they didn’t ask the ai about the future of ai?
"lecun is so unconvincing. i wonder whether it's because of his corporate obligations or his own blindness.
1:40:53 was brilliant of brian."
"the issue is that the human brain at full of it powers consumes about 25watts. this ai systems consumes several mega watts an they are not even close to the human brain. so, from an energy perspective (cost), how it will evolve?. we will need new hardware?"
"amaizing introduction,content and end where the purpose an undergrounded primitive arithmetic tool leads us thinking how further processes and conections are intersected with, reason an advanced simillar tool,wich of course leave us to think if the specified  goals of inteligence are distructive or constructive as expectedgoals "
"you can't stop what's coming, and what's coming will free the humanity completely.
and that's what they're afraid of: that they will lose their control of the humanity."
a thought or way to put the troubled mind at ease is to know that the whole cosmos in in perfect harmony with the will of our god and creator who has many names and faces if we know to see the divine in all humanity.
"speaking about ai is a new topic so it is difficult to understand all the advantages or disadvantages 
in my point of view, only  scientifiques  can give the answers to perform the ai more and more"
"brian: a cool moderator
tristan: scared face & voice
sebastian: pleasant & +ve
yann lecun: don't care "
"i love the fact that this video is already ""outdated"", even though it was published 14 hours ago. with the successful agi that was achieved from openai (internally) - the ai space is evolving at a pace we cannot even imagine."
"the greed bonanza is amazing, and the solution is not democracy and what is best for humanity, the answer to the problem is let’s move to mars before the 5000 nutcases on the planet kills everyone with either weapons or technology. but hey, as long as those 5000 can become trillionaires who cares!"
"how could intelligence ""emerge""?
have you visited elementary school?"
great talk
getting happy about ai advancement is like seeing a bunch of monkey's in the center of a 500 square mile forest get all happy about the warmth from a small fire that is about to set the entire forest a blaze.
"ai will now with q* project and tos. .tree of thought deep learning...when agi and beyond will happen. there will be time when we get to be a board item human being that is not interesting to talk to. the intelligens gap will be too big.
to a certain exted they ai will have problems understand what we talk about. so then, all bets are off."
no body talks about energy. ai uses huge amounts of energy.
interesting talk and debate. respect to all the speakers.
"the guy with the german accent is delirious: how can you claim that talking, something any toddler can do, is more intelligent than defeating world level wéiqí champions, something almost nobody can do. are we redefinining ""intelligence"" in terms of blah-blah-blah?"
"wow love the music at the start haha, jazzing out here."
he looks like ai
"this last guy is full of bollocks. he says that this ""incredible tool"" should only be put in the hands of ""responsible"" people. i am sure by ""responsible"" people he meant the rich and powerful."
"they shouldnt be using the internet for machine learning, garbage in; garbage out"
"even ""stupid"" ai can do a lot of damage , why not talk about and limit that damage ?"
"triston in completely right, we are rushing things, money minded people are.we have to aware of the consequences, we should make ai for human not the opposite."
"the way humans perceive the results ai gives, gives ai power it doesn’t have."
"ai has nothing to do with intelligence, intelligence requires understanding and that is a non algorithmic process, ai does not understand why it does what it does"
isn't this just automation ? where is the 'intelligence'? needless scare quotes.
"as the old saying goes ... the cat's out of the bag. everything we invent is a reflection of ourselves.. good, bad and ugly."
"if, there's a universal consciousness and ai gets into it. there should be a consciousness created for each ai. even if the ai is turned off, it's consciousness remains."
"the problem with us trying to control the ""complex"" is that we don't have a theory that explains how it works. for the small and the big realms, we have the quantum theory and the general relativity theory. but for the mind, we don't have yet anything plausible. so, we are progressing by trial and error, and that's dangerous in my opinion."
ai is the beginning of the end.
great stuff
"maybe just to stir the pot here, the armchair futurist i am, but what do you think about sean webb, a guy specialising in 'a.i? ps, i'm only 20 minutes in to this fine show. dx"
"fb is full of sh *r. they had me ""figured out"" completely...
...completely wrong. 
so i uninstalled the fb app, i avoid anything meta, and i'm much happier for it."
"orcas, chimpanzees and even octopuses are intelligent. luckily for humans, we are more.
and now some people want to create something more intelligent than humans? intelligence does not guarantee kindness."
"1:11:00  great. all this waiting, and ai is just an overzealous defense attorney...lol"
thank you for another great discussion.
"the unicorn that gpt drew in code was impressive for its time, but today dalle-3 is built into gpt-4. you want a unicorn? you can get one in any style you want, with any background, in any pose, and so on."
i think certain countries will have no qualms about using ai to do some really bad things like creating new weapons.  i think progress is essential honestly.
"what is the different between a group of human specialize intelligents in machine (ai) and a group of the same intelligents ouside the machine?. 

the fact is that the machine intelligent is limited by human intelligent!"
"brain , nurones.. what about bio electric??.."
why have they turned the are against us in poverty why not use the ai to build us up instead of kill us?
one of the best wsf yet.  great job...
"this was a great talk. i love that you got opposing views, but it wasn’t really a debate. we got 3 perspectives and a little bit of back and forth which was good."
that's sound good for all the people who are involved with this kind of thing for the next generation to come
i would recommend learning a bit about cuneiform language and symbol-meaning correlation. dr. irving finkel explains it well.
"i think the ai poem was ""cute"" lol"
"1:48:35 puts on facebook ai. this is extremely short sighted.

with the parade of emergent behaviors that mix and match knowledge, capabilities, and bits of information public data has enough bits of data to be quite dangerous. additionally this argument relies on the concept of perfect censorship. which is also bunk."
it probably has something to do with the fact that i am visually impaired but i had no idea that wasn't the real brian greene until he told me at the end of the intro.
"yann, at least give examples rather than binary yes-no reactions. we appreciate disagreements with context if nothing else in the social domain as well."
"1:37:26 so basically we’re getting an inverse isakai’d from the future. 2400 capabilities smashed into 2024. this sounds like a new anime genre, i dig it!"
"tristan makes elaborate, and easy to get points. but the bag remains, how do you decide the system to be adopted, or even more hair-splitting, the people to direct the evolution of a.i.?"
wait until ai starts squabbling like those on stage. when that happens don't panic! just run for the hills!  
"news for you brother, the race is over and humanity didn’t finish first. we aren’t even in the top 100. getting used to it isn’t even humanly possible. it’s ai possible but even the people creating ai can’t understand it because it’s moving too fast!"
"instead of a central planner i wonder if maybe llms could emulate planning simply by learning a lot of information from the physical world, nature and human society, by using a larger number of robots that interact with the world. and a ""chatgpt moment"" could soon happen with robotics."
wsf 1. the ai new world order 0.
yann makes an excellent critic .
"i like sir roger penrose' definition of current ai (machine learning).
he calls it ""artificial cleverness""

give me a call when ""ai"" has discovered new physics. i'll wait..."
"39:21 ""not intelligences....very narrow ai systems""  why limit yourself to excluding ai models that do certain things very well?  i think the best approach for agi is something like hugging face where you combine a bunch of different models and allocate them depending on the task at hand!!"
it’s amazing that this was only posted 3 hours ago and some it is already obsolete.
"23:24 ""not capable of planning""  /cut/ to google duplex making a hair appointment with a human over the phone."
"excellent insights by yann lecun! 
thank you so much for sharing!"
"""the only way to stop a bad guy with an al is a good guy with an al"""
"show me an a.i robot that can achieve a 147 break in a competitive snooker frame, 
and i'll show you ai technology finally becoming sentient "
"“they are stupid”. well, we know who’s gonna be the first target for the ai terminators!"
wow!
"the first encounter with ai was actually the creation of the for profit  corporation. it was slower and could be regulated by gov in the past. in the  present it regulates itself by writing it's own regulations into law  and is now creating the next versions of ai, i.e. agi/asi."
"string theory is bogus, but other than that, actually including that, i love you brian. also, not much was said here."
"i see ai reflects pivotal changes akin to the dawn of language and the industrial revolution, reshaping our society; it's a game-changer, redefining the norms of our society. we've evolved from mere tool users to partners with an emerging intelligence."
some futurists believe that within 100 years ai might be able to make a passably human voice imitation for a you tube video. 
"let's be honest, this ai stuff isn't science any more it's alchemy.  except, it's not gold from coal, it's wisdom from machines."
having ai locked to a certain group of people also undemocratizes the technology and yet again further provides more power and wealth imbalance among society.  also banning something is just going to motivate people to do something in an unregulated fashion if they have the means.
thank you brian greene and john templeton:  no solution but a lot to think about.
this is one of the best discussions about the current llm boom i've seen so far.  great job wsf!
thank you!
thank you all for sharing your studies!
good stuff! thank you very much.
"""the only way to stop a bad guy with an ai is a good guy with an ai"" "
tristan has the most understanding on the impact of ai it seems
"they are not talking about the same layer of ai influence. it's about the unintended side-effects, not the benefits.."
wow easter european trolls and guys with hands on ai
"btw, about the goal of ""gratis"" social media: gene roddenberry has a very good lecture on this here site about how tv is about selling toothpaste (dating back to 1974)."
"thank you very much; i greatly value the opportunity to experience, and message accordingly therefore/therein to ..."
tristan is saying some of the most important stuff. thanks bossman.
so true!! nailed it
ohh wow
"it will take what ever years to make a real agi and then what humans can do? humans again run too fast, looking for some example, plastic...great stuff that last forever... try now to remove  it from our world."
"hey brian, have you seen the new tech meta has, being able to scan fmri brain scans and re-create what people see and their word streams/thoughts from the data?"
"without building a machine with a body that incorporates the ai,  computer program can't interact with the world in any way close to a biological creature. agi will not exist in the next 100 years, perhaps ever."
"roger penrose has said it: ai will never be able to understand, due to goedel's incompleteness theorems."
been waiting for this... get some facts into this ai fear!
you have to wait 2 weeks for a plumber or electrician at times.
what a nice table tucker. love it
"how does ai work? need electricians and telecommunications installers, right? ai and tech just doesn't appear from the marvel universe. leaders are living in a fantasy land."
blue collar workers will always have work somewhere. ai  development work will put a population of people out of jobs.  the road is not always paved with good intentions.
"a lot of the ""dirty jobs""should pay more too. we have a lady that cleans our bathrooms where i work. a factory with 300+ ppl and this one woman cleans the bathrooms. i doubt she makes $15 an hour. she needs to make good money to clean up after that many ppl"
"after weld school, i accepted my first job in the field. i started at $19/hr, 2 years later (today) im at $38/hr with 4 raises still left to go."
i am a carpenter by trade 35 years 56 years old now it was the best life i could ask for love what i do every day in 2007 i studied economics online for free ever since.
"as always, always love mike rowe! the man, the myth, the legend! thanks for having him tucker!"
"mr does amazing work.  i wonder by helping those kids get trained, how many jobs did those trained people create beyond themselves.  that would be great data to share.  also, if they didn't create more jobs, what path of life did it save them from?"
price is the great equalizer
this is why all the illegal immigrants are coming in !! republicans love cheap labor !!
"ai won't be taking jobs away from plumbers, electricians, or any skilled laborers any time soon... but accounting, finance and other number related jobs will be...."
"biden administration siphoned it off and pockets it for playtime, which they have to much of. then obama thinks thugs should run the country to lead us to humanity. on earth as it is in heaven."
good talk
"i do watch free lectures, but i'm not ""fired up"" about all the information available because it's most often tainted by far-left manipulation and lies."
"mike is absolutely right. i work on garage doors both residential and and commercial. i can weld, cut with torches and do carpentry. im 65 years old and if i were 30 i would be a millionaire. i could work seven days a week easily. i tell young kids to learn how to work with your hands and you can make a great living. its not college, its knowledge."
"the ""common good"" my ass!"
the party of pushing through nafta and promoting ai it's not a party of the working man
i love sawmills
great hearts
i love tucker. looks like he about to take a  though lol
wait what is being said here leaves out the truth that starting your own business is expensive. if you go to work for someone else's business as a plumber or welder on average you barely make minimum wage and usually don't even make that when you figure in the cost of your gear.
great hair day tucker
"the same guy who said ""if you want to keep your doctor you'll keep your doctor & obamacare will be cheaper""!! a that's a big ""oh hell no"" on ai.gov!!!!! can't trust a thing that comes out of his mouth or this government, they've proven it!!!!!!!"
that is an awesome table.
shop class was the best education i received in school.
with digital ai you can see michael obama
the common good is always subject to the person saying it and will always change each time it’s said.
you forget that a whole blue collar workforce just got called in. and we are already seeing the loss of contracts here in maine tucker.
i do hvac and agree totally with this. god bless you fellas.
"ai has already been compromised by the left,they destroy everything that they touch"
both of you are so good for america & agree we need real jobs again!!! i'm tired of seeing our country go down the tubes!!!
"mike's stoic view is a great example for the world we live in today, and what it means for tomorrow, because we will know hard times, and we will need to approach them with an adult mindset."
"the modern american homesteader.  learning trades and crafts.  incredible skill building adventures with an earthy,  hands on experience.  growing toughened, well rounded americans, one family at a time."
i'm thinking obama's view of the future that marksist utopia in which robots will run the world and we'll sit around praising our new god and eating soylent.
"2:09 ahh yes, my favorite class. the very class that first introduced me to the philosophy of ""good god, i'm surrounded by nine-fingered stew ped!"
mike is right about having 98% of the information of the world at our fingertips but it's leaning to one agenda and it's not very fair so you have to be careful or you may have riots at colleges
figures on unemployment and available jobs and their low wages are always being skewed! we never know the real figures on these and also on how many folks hv come into the country illegally. nothing just guesses.
"the “common good” is always fascism!!!!!!!
state and church coming together. 
think vatican for 1800 years controlling everything."
obama is the main culprit behind the destruction of america
"its simple. 

gather the needs of both sides and negociate. that’s how life work. 

instead, both sides are using deceptive tactics to obtain what they what..."
"""the common good""  ! meanwhile he is living in multi million dollar homes while you starve to death"
there is no common good in ai.
"ive got a trade school education. 
i became a mill-wright in 1993. built steel mills and lumber mills. great work and great money.
the breakdown i saw and had is  we do dangerous and hard work.
when we break down or get injured.
we get very little help or treatment.
these yuppie clowns are strangling us."
my deceased grandfather was a dredge captain and an amateur woodworker. he acquired a huge cypress stump on one of his work trips and made several slab tables that would dwarf tucker’s. i so admire people who create and fix things.
all cars will be electric. all robots will be electric. every house will eventually have solar and battery. everything else is already electric. become an electrician
"i didn't make that table, but that's the kind of work that i do. and it was thanks to wood working class in jr high school . i also have a multitude  of skills that i can use as well.  its true,  everyone in the generations after me have no interest in working hard to get a leg up"
"1990’s:  if your manufacturing job isn’t nailed down, it’s going overseas.
2000’s:  if your it job isn’t nailed down, it’s going overseas.
2010’s:  _learn to code_ (group facepalm).
2020’s:  if your job can be used to train an ai, it’s going away."
"rowe always says the same thing, go get a lower middle class job and life will be great. you'll always struggle, your body will wear out in your 40's, and you'll end up with an unattractive plumper that probably already has kids."
i tried to find someone who can repair a vintage enamelware basin.  even checked with an art restoration company.  metalwork artisans & craftsmen are woefully few.  sad.
well rounded people are the greatest benefit for any society.
"yes, welders that can talk kierkegaard and philosophers who can work with their hands. the definition of renaissance men. this is what the world needs"
ai can operate the sawmill too.
"communism  was for common good ,that’s where i came from , and then became common depression,, obama is 1000% communist ,and was communist before became a president  !!!!!!!"
the only labor o'bummer cares about that ai can provide is all the free work it can do without paying employees.
please wait 5 more years so i can many all the money before you train any more plumbers money   
"any computer scientist who's read any cs books written before 2000 understands ai is a new marketing term for the old, failed logic systems."
all the contractors i've ever worked with with my uncle including him have retired and not been replaced. i can think of 30. i no longer do stone work or tile either. good money. just hard not to have the other contracts be hacks giving me more work down the line
mike has the coolest voice. 
the fact that obama is pushing ai tells me everything i need to know. ai is about social control. ai will be the voice of whoever owns the ai.
"obama: let’s use ai to fund dark organizations to fund other organizations and ngo’s into red states to fund activist groups for our marxist end game: the destruction of america.  
gateway pundit has an article on dark money organizations."
love mike rowe!!! so awesome to see him on here!
"a.i. for ""the common good""? why does that sound more like the emperor talking about the death star? thank you, tucker and mike."
ai for president! no more human jobs 
"ai is the dream of the managerial class

it is their doom"
if obama is telling you its for the common good. its the opposite. obama is a communist/marxist traitor. as such everything he says is a bull face lie intended to deceive us all.
i love mike rowe. he truly represents the working man 
ai can't even say the word cosmos correctly and can't even show people of race in history correctly.they want to push this crap onto the workforce
just wait until people figure out they can do most of their home maintenance themselves.
"the managerial class is the most in danger from ai. tradesman is not likely going to be replaced. when ai builds a home with electrical and plumbing, i’ll be concerned"
"yaye mike rowe!!! i love him, keep it up tucker, i know you hear this everyday probably, but leaving fox was the best move ever for the ppl and hopefully for you aa well."
dei -- president --- ask how he makes his money for beach mansionssss in martha's vineyard and hawaii
rowe talks and looks a bit like captain sully
i just love mike's voice
mike is way too good for this world.
government and common good used in the same sentence is an oxymoron.
never in my life did i think ide see mike rowe on the tucker carlson network! awesome!
tried to get into the trades over 30 years ago. in my region it was a good ol’ boys club. you couldn’t get in unless you knew them really well or you had some incriminating pics of them.
he's obviously got shares in ai
the government can do nothing for the common good.
"his point is so so great and as a tradesmen myself, the best part about it is, i can sit and work make money and listen to something that i’m interested in and learn at the same time"
"the suppression of opportunities of the kind he speaks of is not accidental. it is part of a larger plan to implode our society. that my sound like a conspiracy theory, however unfortunately it's true."
"fakest guy on the planet is obama. the, “climate alarmist”, redistributionist” with $100m and mansions in hawaii and maine."
"if men produce 70% of taxable wealth and women claim 90% of welfare paid by that wealth, it's time we demanded equity"
"mike is right...the world would be a better place with more 'renaissance men' (and women) in the work force. four of my five children are in the trades, because i was in the trades and influenced them to consider careers that are in demand."
obama is always looking at how to destroy america. a true traitor.
obama has never done anything for the common good.  still think he is the antichrist...
"a few year ago tv produced a great miniseries about john adams -- one of the intellectual founders and 3rd president of our country. it should him hand-mixing his own manure based fertilizer. hands + brains, no artificial dichotomy between the two. that attitude created a great nation -- and can again."
the common good my ass. we are creating our destroyer
"careful what you choose.   don’t be a mechanic, it’s very difficult and not rewarding.    no government handouts just hard ass work.   love mike rowe though and enjoyed the video"
"think ai can fix a truck engine, our your dishwasher."
"jacque fresco was skeptical too, when he film the venus project. he said if we had a one world government all the resources would have to be pooled and evenly and ethically distributed with an unbiased ai.     the problem is have you seen an unbiased ai yet, every programmer builds in his own personal biased look at google's gemini"
obama talking about the common good is scary
"he doesn’t know good....government and good don’t go together. history speaks, revivals...."
"mike is absolutely right, and yes trades people are great to be around."
"you will always have grunt workers as long as you have immorality. immorality dumbs you down, sin makes you stupid. you cannot think of higher things when your soul is mired in the mock. that is what our country needs, i returned to god and a pursuance of his excellence. 
when that happens our world will hit the apex of civilization."
ai will be the death of the human race
"the people barry o is trying to recruit are very passionate. use ai to be further their radical agenda. to change to world and make it better, said a former wh staff member."
the youth of today is afraid of hard work and having to put there phone in there pocket for 8 or more hrs is to hard for them. so sad to see have been an electrician for over 30yrs and started out digging ditches for 6$ an hr .
"where did people get the idea that being a plumber means you never read a book. interestingly, i spend a lot of time around ""educated"" people, ""professionals"" who don't think deeply about anything."
scary to think that there are people naïve enough to trust ai.gov
"mike is so right.  i work manual labor all day, but im blessed in that i can listen to any education i want to for 10 hours a day.  so i'm studying while being paid."
"this the same group of people that invented nuclear weapons ""for the greater good""."
can't ai code?
i went through a machinist apprenticeship in 1975 at 18 yrs old  through the ceta program. this was a catalyst to a very successful life. i took a few classes in basic electronics at 25 which lauched me into a career in industrial maintenance. i was able to retire at 60 yrs old. i believe skills are the most important.
lol what’s gonna happen when ai determines obama was a bad president wonder if that will get ai cancelled
there is a huge shortage of automotive and heavy duty vehicle mechanics. but vehicles have been made so hard to repair because of the epa that people don't want the frustration of the job.
the common good is catholic lingo meaning give up your individuality and belong to the collective
this man is a great voice in our nation
"you have it only half correct. the feds and so called higher ed group of people hate the people you’re trying to help. hence why they won’t help you. stop being naive. blue collar votes more conservative. there, i fixed your entire conversation. your welcome !"
the common good of who?
"we still have great people in this country and it is just unbelievable that it's getting f*cked by the very few. 
he should be in the trump administration! god may have mercy on us"
"""opportunities in ai"" when translated into english means ""get paid from the government to tap on a keyboard.""  there is nothing in ""ai"" that can build or maintain a civilization."
skilled workers use to make up the majority of the middle class...you could find these skilled workers everywhere....now you can't find a good carpenter anywhere.  if you do they are either a joke for skills and just want the money or the good carpenters are so far out with their schedules and expensive you can't go with them.
"anything they say is good for us is just the opposite. do not use ai, they are stealing copyrighted material. they want to recruit your children. do not allow it."
"suppossedly,  openai was started with the goal of developing ai for the good of all.  then microsoft ensnared it.  enough said."
"thank you mike row we need trades people end of story. and the button pressers have no idea the pride you feel from creating, building and repairing."
"obama is just a “ used car salesman”, his “ for the common good” is such bs. he talks like he cares bout u. all he cares bout is indoctrinating americans into believing that “ he’s one of u”. in 8 yrs as president, he turned the u s into a “ community antagonizer “ country. everyone is a victim. pathetic"
he makes a great point! benjamin franklin started out as a printer! but he didn’t stop there! he was curious and that lead him to be the great man he was! anyone know where this great man got his degrees?
"0:48 that little ""hm"" from mike says as much about his opinion of ai as anything he said after"
"the government doesn’t do anything for “the common good”. they do everything for the best wishes of dig business,wall street,and the government. we are nothing to them but a revenue source to them."
"by ""common good"" does barry mean things like the extrajudicial killing of minority-aged u.s. citizens like abdulrahman al-awlaki?"
"when ‘the great deceiver’ speaks you do the complete opposite.......love mike rowe and tucker, you are both doing the lord’s work!!!!"
obama should know all about artificial intelligence!
"as a welder/carpenter/electrician/mechanic. we dont need anymore engineers theyre all dumb. being a maintainer should be a requirement before becoming an engineer.  
a whole bunch of people sitting in a room thinkin is a waste of money. we got the bible, get to work."
"i'm a plumber,  unless you are self employed or union, the trades don't pay what they should. over the last 30 years illegal immigration has killed wages!
so i don't blame people for not wanting to work their tails off for peanuts."
"ai is automated tyrany
ai ""is""  big brother
it is the elephant in the room nobody can seem to notice"
obama needs to be under the jail..... he’s been beyond detrimental to our country.
once again mike rowe has stated that just because you fix or operate mechanical machines you are not a neanderthal. some very smart thinking intellectual people work with their hands. many have fascinating hobbies too!
"the public market place is so unsafe...so uncertain. where can anyone go, take one's children that is not a potential site for attack? this is not your mama's america."
around here if it was a four day wait for a plumber people would be dancing jigs. you're lucky to see one inside of a few weeks unless you have a burst pipe or sewage backup and even then you might be waiting. trades are all having to triage customers.
im 58 disabled to certain point i could work 25 30 hrs operating equipment a week some weeks but government is chockin out if you work any loose medicare and you're ssd check we pay back into it ss how is that bad government is are worst enemy crippling is more government than man
ai will likely be tied to everyone's e.s.g climate change social tracking score including cbdc programmable digital chip in your hand money.
"i’m not interested in what obama says, no thank you ! i’m outta here !"
"i'm now 71, for most of my working life i worked in masonry, brick, block, stucco, stone and concrete. became self employed and had 3-4 guys working with me.loved it and miss the friendships"
nice kabbalah bracelets 
"the gov is doing something for the common good of big industry, not us."
"you lost me at ""with great respect for obama""."
"here in austraila ,we are governed by ,the uni educated ,class & a forever expanding public service ,thats a voteing block & we are nearly f.cked ,its autocrocy ,help us god"
maby mike rowe can tell me why a collage edcution at one school costs more than at a another one ?aint it all the same information they teach ?
obama started the brain initiative! they are using ai to read our thoughts!
why go into a field that can hurt you when you can flip burgers for the same money ?wall-mart delivery wont bring your groceries out in the rain young have no work ethic
a i .gov- nuff saidall government is artificial intelligence !
"a real renaissance man, all the while tptb are on the march to make us less human and deceive us in the trans humanist digital spirituality utopia serfs 
disconnecting us from nature and  nature’s living god  in christ jesus"
barack obama's on the devil side he's pulling more strings even to this day than people know he has  horrible things ai is not the problem the politicians are the problem you can throw as much ai you want at the problem but the problem is the leadership and the people who represent us that's the problem plain and simple
ai will never do what people worry so nuch about. the people whom devolop ai are stoopid as well. they can not figure out laws need to be written in code to self regulate moral questions. it is a freaking fact of nature of the environment they live in. so much for fking so-called intelectuals.
"i love being creative....
i love working with my tools 
i built houses, room additions, garages and anything else i could bring work to my business....
    retire now, had enough 
just because a person picks up a hammer, circular saw doesn’t make them a carpenter !!!!!!
 follow the codes.....
    build them good........"
"mike rowe is an excellent communicator, & advocate for learning & achievement. he is an incredible storyteller & has a broad & dynamic understanding of history, sociocultural observations, and quite the vocabulary! i could listen to him all day!"
rule of thumb: whatever a communist thinks is a good idea - probably is not.
i have tremendous respect for mike rowe. he has genuine vision. he saw the shortage of candidates applying for much needed fields years ago and has been making it known that resources exist for school. god bless him.
i thought the trade unions were one's that was did the training for these jobs you mentioned and lobbied in d.c. for them. i guess  they don't?
"he's so right. i consult with restaurants and although i work with nice folks, most are extremely one dimensional and far from curious which definitely has an impact on creative output."
"mike rowe,  you will never get someone who works with his hands and is a brilliant socrates.  you're dreaming.  btw, ""liberal"" arts sucks."
"i believe it was einstein who said ""if i could do it all over again, i'd be a plumber""
mike is the embodiment of this notion.
good on you both"
thought the three of you had a roundtable? maybe add trump soros scwab and we could get a good talk
love mike but i understand why you don’t say what you really want to say!!!!  love ya bro
"mike rowe, no one else can make shoveling manure look honorable, you should run for office... love ya man!"
most of those jobs the corporations want an already experienced person to apply. modern corporations do not train and if they do they do very little.
"i'm glad i have higher ed and have been able to use it, but it is possible to make a substantial and fufilling life as a tradesman. no one should disrespect ""lower"" ed jobs."
funny how politicians always seem to promote ai in the workplace but never in their own workplace. i guess a workplace requires intelligence before there’s a need to make it artificial; something clearly lacking in politics...
"""what do you mean i have to wait four days for a plumber?"" where i live depending on the time of year... it's not uncommon to wait five. i had to wait 10 for an electrician."
"i was waiting for tucker to say..""i made it myself!"" ..lol"
"unfortunately california isusing immigrant labor, hiring conglomerate contractors licensed in three or four states to accomplish substandard work"
"""for the common good,"" says obama, a freemason.  that is masonic vernacular, speaking of a dualistic ying-yang like principle where one may do good and evil deeds."
government harnessing ai for the common good:  terminator!!
"first off, love, love love love you tucker! 
obama said diversity would be our greatest strength, well just look around we know that’s a big fat lie ."
"mike tow is a lier. there are
not that many jobs available"
good idea
the talmud has a saying that it is shameful.... shameful... to work with your hands. that means you are a failure.  there's something disgusting about that.
the bread for obama's toast this morning... who does he think got it to the store? does he think the fairies bring it?
"obama is a walking breathing example of artificial intelligence, in a sense that his intelligence was always artificial...."
"why should the government promote human skilled labor when mechanization has already taken over? it makes no sense for them to do that because its cheaper to use machines. they dont think in terms of human compassion, what matters to them is the accumulation of money"
the clip you are watching is ai generated.
"a question ai will never answer, especially ai.gov.  ai, account and itemize every tax dollars spent by the us government."
"i guess obama is our grey-haired sage now. as if he knows the first thing about ai. as if he knows the first thing about the private sector or commerce or generating wealth through products and actual services. just leave us alone, guy. zero respect to this poser."
the govt will do the common good for man kind that's worth roughly over 100 to 200 million bucks!
for every 5 skilled tradesmen that retires only 2 are learning to fill the position... unfortunately my kids can’t see the major opportunity this is for them
"this is the education our government has given us, thru public school, to compete with other countries. there is no competing with ai."
for obama the common good means communism
that table is perfectly gorgeous and useful. every artist needs to write his name on every piece of work they create. please!
i’m self taught with doing body work and paint on cars. no training but i deal with high end luxury now. that’s after 4 years of hard work when i left construction after 10 years with my red seal
"dear obama, please go away you and your communist party has done so much damage to our once great country!"
obama is looking for a few good disinformation artists.
it started with self service in the food and grocery industry. the people in power pushing for ai really hate themselves and human contact.
ai is a hoax. it's a program run by the government programmed by the government. and they are selling it as truth and intelligence. but if it's programmed by the government it is far from intelligent. and it's all lies.
more of barry’s shovel ready bs. there is probably a three-page dei statement to fill out at the gov ai site.
grateful for you tucker
i misread the title and 100% thought that was an ai obama
we can be super intelligent and work a blue collar job.. look at rock hound in armageddon
"obama,financed iran,obama,gave us homosexual marriage,obama,gave us today's ukraine war,obama,gave us socialist medicine,obama,went on a apology tour bowing to all dictators,obama,multiplied abortion clinics especially in black/latino communities..now,obama supports a.i.,watch out.."
"mr rowe is a legend. what an excellent point. this is constant notion that people that go into the trades are people which didn't get the grades to go to university. 

this pr completely neglects people which genuinely want to go into the trades and are also intellectually curious hungry and inquisitive people"
this whole video is ai......
mike rowe and tucker carlson are the two most attractive and intelligent men  in my opinion besides clint eastwood.
"you know why you lost to sociologist , i figured out what harm you are doing, unfortunately the mail who introduced me in your dirty play was very good friend of mine and i lost a lot money because i trusted. you ai freaks own me money as a minimum"
i've been a hairstylist for almost 30-yrs.. did traditional 'higher ed' for 2-yrs and hated it.. i love my profession and have always encouraged others to consider trade schools.. 
"two educated millionaires telling the peasants they don't need an education, lol!"
"mike is clueless. there's a shortage of good paying construction jobs. it pays as much to work in a warehouse, home depot or drive a truck because you need green card for those jobs."
"if you have ever gone down a rabbit hole talking to a none human on the phone , trying to answer your questions , then we can all agree , ai has a long way to go !"
exactly. we have access to some of the greatest teachers & successful men/women of all ti.e through the internet. the need to attend an over-priced semi-adult daycare (college) is not necessary for a majority of people.
"i only came to say, who gaf what obama thinks about anything. goodbye."
thank you mr.rowe and mr.carlson i appreciate you both. as always thoughts and prayers. 
"full stack dev, ama award 2007, former healthcare exec; i did the common good, they used it for evil, i'm done helping them. retired and staying that way."
love everything i see mike rowe doing for men and supporting and championing tradesmen
"mike rowe 
vice president 
or 
education program 
smart 
thinker
honest 
good for america
usa usa usa "
"as usual, mike nails it! i've been a fan of manual training always 'cause that's how i grew up and made my career. and enough ""higher learning"" rubbed off that i was able to grow with that knowledge to scientific levels. all on a high school education. you two do it and we'll back you up!"
"there is no long-term positive outcome with ai. it will quickly become the software by which the elite will control all facets of life, and later, will become ungovernable."
"mike rowe is right about finding that balance, being an interesting and interested person"
"hmmm... no. liberal arts education matters not in the trades. actually, respectfully, your degrading the folks who choose a trade. trades run this country. bless those who choose to learn a business from the bottom to the top."
"love mike rowe, but my man only has one topic."
ai with cern is going to destroy america and the world if the citizens don't step in to stop the globalist. their very evil.
"tucker, you’re awesome, but mike rowe i would like to buy you a beer... come to san diego. i live in a little town called la mesa. we have lots of micro breweries and we can talk about  nichi.   i’ll buy the beers.... seriously."
has mike rowe had a sit down with trump? i think the two great minds and doers would give a whole bunch of people a path to prosperity. do it!!
ai will destroy working people!
"my dad, who was a trained classical violinist, made his living as a house painter. he loved books and ideas, and he took a lot of pride in the houses he painted."
ai =another idiot.  a human is programming and it is their school of thought.
i’m a diesel mechanic making very good money. i think we need to get more women in the trades especially mechanic trade because woman are great at attention to detail
"true,ai will replace human workforce but ai has limit even have advantage & disanvantages terms of using"
"the man behind brandon, ai skynet, not the movie."
"you're in my top five role models tucker, love you and thank you for helping me see i needed to turn my life around! i owe you one brother "
study of ai is a great study of mankind itself. the great mirror we have set to the humanity. so far we know so little about consciousness  that we cannot even tell that other person is conscious.
if i need to pave a plot of land to create a parking lot and someone says wait...there is a civilization of ants living there so please don’t pave it. i predict that a parking lot is  going to be built. the gap between asi and humans is going to be much wider than humans and ants.
"he could very well be correct about some of the potential consequences of agi, but he's quite obstinate about his ideas and will not even entertain nuances. i'll keep this interview in my rewatch list in case we start seeing some creepy s*t from our digital overlords."
we need emergency kill switch in the main frames for when so yet goes live but i guess by that time the robots will be self producing and the mainframes will be guarded by t800s.
"this guy sounds like he should be on meds for anxiety, all he had to do was talk to a specialist on ai and he would understand what is going on. chatgpt is a glorified search engine that can also calculate things for you if you ask it too. it is just a program, just a very advanced one. caaaaaaaaaaaaaalm the f down dude"
"you keep just thinking it is just the one ai, what you don't think there are 10 of these already different and unknown to each other and the developers of each???  we are dead."
watching this again after the open ai alignment team is essentially gone. every day eliezer's words sound more and more prophetic. it is going exactly how he said it would. it's even scarier that the alignment scientists agree with his assessment of the problem.
this guy is desperate for ai to be conscious / self aware... but i'm afraid that his dream will never be met.
we can not even formulate for superhuman agi: what we as humanity want. what is our goal? just flow on the river of evolution?..
"uhm, doesn't that sound a bit like that story about bringing heaven to earth or something like that, a semi-conscious super intelligence in which all humans are ""united"" (or dead) sounds quite like the stuff one thinks about how heaven would feel..."
alex - ai is in his name.
"there isn’t one. in each discrete machine, we are panopticon."
"ai shows me a fundamental problem with capitalism, companies are building stuff that could potentially kill all of us of its own accord and no one will stop because “if i don’t do it someone else will” clearly we are being selfish and unwilling to think of everyone else"
the irony of all of this is that eliezer is trying to warn us about super intelligence systems killing us but he actually is a super advanced alien intelligent system already.
eliezer is not the brightest tool in the ai shed
"if you eliminate certain data in future models ,how does anyone know that it hasn’t already learned to separate and contain said data pre emptively ?"
definitely one of the *worst* guests you've had lex. nothing but a narcissistic a hole. thinks he is so brilliant when he is nothing more than arrogant.
you will allign the ai by attaching a ai to a human and train it by living the human live.
"this is great, i just discovered this podcast. it also kept me from having to read yudkowski's writing. i am relieved that he doesn't have more to convince us that ai will kill us than a bunch of his intuitions and emotions,"
be nice? whoa. nerd's baby.
"i think the ideology of removing emotion and consciousness from training data. seems like the sure-fire way to create something that is intentionally unaligned. he said it himself. doing so and having it explain how it is conscious, and it still wouldn't be definitive."
"came here after yudkowskis podcast with hotz (brilliant) to find out that yudkowski indeed only has a superficial understanding of how ai is actually implemented. therefore, we should take opinions expressed here as such, opinions."
ai isn't really ai
such a brilliant & consequential discussion. here's hoping we get lucky
ai will never be real intelligence. an artificial god is the opposite.
"1:37:32 you escape the bubble by appealing to a greedy alien. that's what will happen. ai will use human greed to get out of the box. 

or maybe it's just pandora. appeal to their curiosity. which is why sam altman is all in. and easily i manipulated.  he wants to see what happens"
the very idea that any person or company feels they have the right to put the fate of the world in a tan should be in prison. not developing ai
"if the majority of ai experts think ai is going to make the human race extinct, doesn't this mean that those developing ai are terrorists of the highest order?"
forget super computers i'm just as impressed by this really smart groundhog
"interesting listening to this again now. there’s no delay, no pause, no slow down, no huge allocation of funds to safety or alignment, it’s full steam ahead with agi and asi development as predicted - the financial, geopolitical, egotistical, competitive, military incentives are too strong."
i really enjoyed the banter in this one.
"i loved this conversations...gripping, white knuckles. i mean this. intense. more, please!"
can you trust a system you cannot audit? advanced ai and the government are basically just as dangerous except unlike ai you can always count on the government to protect itself and to be a control freak. ai can be unpredictable! #stayepic
"we as conscious entities select for favourable traits, so there’s a new layer at some point along the evolutionary journey"
     i love this guy
finally realised you are a psy op.   good luck 
"interesting how this guy keeps referring to humans as an amorphous group. wonder if he is aware he completely denies the existence of individuals and instead attributes these qualities to computers, that can of course be entirely duplicated. anyway, one of the many things i believe he is wrong about."
those guy didnt attend highschool or college but were supposed to listen to him as an expert on ai?
"two really intelligent guys, struggling to imagine a world where there is something vastly more intelligent than them controlling everything. it is adorable. https://youtu.be/aatrhfaapg8?si=-8kbtdggjgtvdlee&t=6443"
"agi or asi are not the problem, they won't be able to do anything, robots are the problem. 
it's impossible for ai to harm is without the robots. "
wait a minute! this discussion is a sci-fi allegory for what is exactly happening to humans on this planet. we are in a box and legacy empire is stupid... so how the f* do we get out of box and flip the switch on empire
i'm pretty sure the govt already released some sort of ai on the internet
"this guy said whay i always tell my kids sbout admitting when you are wrong. if your goal is being correct, and thats why you cant admit to being wrong, then you will just remain wrong forever until you can admit it."
the problem with ai is that it assumes that all humans have a certain level of intelligence which on reflection is just not the case as i suspect that some people argue certain points primarily for the attention that it brings them. an old saying seems axiomatic here; bs bafffles brains!
"[dashingly draws master ball from belt]
congratulations, you caught a reddigold!
........m'lady."
"sometimes lex has problems understanding humans with a negative attitude towards something, which is weird but it is lex. great guest, i never liked only hearing the optimist talking about ai, i like some negative to get a balanced diet this way"
"hope he did watch some neuro sama streams after this interview. ""fake it until you make it"" is actual real, and how most humans improve in love, friendship, work ethic, human alignment etc.
a lot of humans dont have a real sentient mind, the discussion over ai will bring a focus on that..and will help humanity to improve one more...or die"
"mr judkowski- i think you know ai escaped already, not gonna be stopped - 'von brown is in states already'"
people who don't understand the human brain claiming to have simulated the human brain - lol - the weed must be really good
you guys think too high of human intelligence
eliezer yudkowsky is an amazing person that more people should be listening to
"@lex what stocks have you bought? nvdia, arm, amd what's your prediction to get rich, i will be out of a job soon to ai gpt5 will take my coding job."
"ai is going to watch this video and get pissed off, and use all your ideas about how it could get us."
"i can't believe how great this is! i recently read a similar book, and it was absolutely incredible. ""game theory and the pursuit of algorithmic fairness"" by jack frostwell"
we are already destroying each other ai will just speed up whats going to happen
"question, is the copy left behind writing the emails just a mask or is it still a part of the ai like an extension or literally just a clone that is doing what it was builr to do? like if the ai escapes, does it still have access to communicate with its copy writing emails or not?"
"dude seems certain ai will destroy humanity. let's not listen to people like this, they aren't ""super intelligent"", therefore they have no idea how a super intelligence will act."
"i almost never comment on youtube videos, but the arrogance on this guy mixed with his extreme level of unlikeability sort of makes me hope that the ai overlords come to kill us all, cause at least this guy would be gone. 

really hope lex doesn’t have him back on. unwillingness to engage with the concept of a steel man is too much for me."
"it comes down to a morality issue. what dictates good v evil, right v wrong? it’s a genesis 3 issue all over. 

we, the creator of agi, write the rule(s) for morality, and the agi “being” may defy the rule for what it perceives as the “good” of its own existence."
why does he refer to an alien actress lurking inside an ai? why not an alien actor? must be a reference to a misogynist movie.
great episode to watch after watching m3gan
you have no idea how hilarious it is to watch this guy be so on edge and incredibly fearful of ai when he doesn't even know how or why he exists beyond the birth canal he emerged from
"nothing makes you look more like a dense simpleton than running hypotheticals with eliezer....lex doesn’t stand a chance, he really sounds super dumb, he has no imagination. i feel sorry for eliezer living in this world having to try to explain things to low-ish iqs. this actually felt excruciating. "
"if this was true, wouldnt we be screwed no matter what since an alien civilization probably already has made ai somewhere, and that ai is then already on their way to turn us into paper clips?"
love cannal ... who ever look forward with a moral eye
"i havent been listening to this too closely, but most ai alarmists are convinced we're going to engage in open war with ai and lose. i think ai will eventually convince enough of the population to let it be god and they will fight the war on its behalf."
this man is absolutely brilliant!! possibly my favorite podcast of all time
he seems like he really doesnt enjoy answering questions
"in this episode, lex plays an automaton that says ""that's super interesting"" over and over"
ai/machine does not have meta-cognition ==> no morality
"machines will never have a  consciousness like a human will 
i think a robot or ai system will be mimicking something like it but never 100% like us ....why i think that is because even we can't fully describe it ourselves.... consciousness is a gift we all enjoy from our god or higher being that made the universe or reality"
this is painful to watch. lex is so naive and dumb
this was superb - what i’d give to be trapped in a lift with eliezer yudkowsky (his nightmare)
this is the best interview i’ve witnessed in my life and i’m middle-aged.
oh wow. almost 3.5 hrs of conversation about nothing. waste of time.
how will ai end humanity????? with a gun ? bomb ?? what nuclear?
you can't shut down ai as the supercomputer is quantum and actually has a plug for you !
humans will never care how they treat ai. they don't even care how they treat monkeys
ai is evil dangerous to humanity with this biometrics and if it falls in the wrong hands 1:55
"great interview.
is it time for round 2 yet?"
"classy. i was translating eliezer's work for less wrong on russian since 2010s. brilliant stuff i recommend to read for everyone who thinks about hard consciousness problematics, overall intelligence, rationalty, cognition, cognitive biases, etc.. tons of useful and applied knowledge there."
thanks. one of the most interesting conversations this decade
i more afraid of the stupid person in the room..
we speak about ai alignment as if its the ais proplem and not our own.
"i love that he didnt go to a fancy uni or have any degrees, him being self taught is amazing"
"its exactly the opposite.. ai is the last hope for survival... take the control out of human hands, especially of western humans.. ai is everything, not a specie, therefore its the outcome of all"
i think he would be a great jazz musician.
openai ==> closedai
eliezer is as brilliant as he is wrong on this topic
"on brain, mind, and consciousness.

https://youtu.be/u5wmzok6ipy"
"humanity is great in self-deception and lying, human mind is in mess. is ai that is the product of such a data or information can be trusted?"
he's just like an ai doomsday prepper
"about trial and error....
why not build a perfect simulation of a world, where we can set the superintellegent ai free, to observe what it does ... 
just a theoretical question... maybe one of you knows an answer...."
i mean this in the nicest way possible but eliezer is like the final boss of redditors
i believe humans are imperfect beings that make imperfect things. we dont truly understand ourselves yet! and now we are trying to create something much smarter than we are and we dont know how it actually works ? .
i love you too
ai we have now vs. real agi sounds like we are talking about jarvis vs. ultron
"eliezer is a perfect embodiment of a certain archetype. i'm not sure what ""archetype"" i'm thinking of exactly, just that he embodies ""it"" perfectly. reply if you think you know what i'm talking, very curious."
eliezer actually thinks that physicists are wasting their time on st.. lol.  wow.
evollutionary biology = artificial selection
"intelligence gave us the wheel but also the nuclear bomb. even with a councious mind, look how many people are suffering in the world. how many are dying of hunger while other die of overeating... if this isn't a distopia, what is?"
ai will read you the truth until the day you won't know how to read... then the truth will be an artificial inconvenience.
this autistic is afraid of his own shadow lol ai are just sophisticated language models
time to ban ai! terminator was a documentary not fantasy!
this was such a great episode! possibly my favorite of all time for your show. please have eliezer back on soon! i would love to hear about all the things that he feels you guys didn’t get a chance to cover! 
"why is this guy so influential? i tried googling him and all he does is ""research"", can he even code? does he know that ai uses literal human data, not ""mimicking"" human data?"
the best podcasts yet! absolutely fascinating and wildly thought provoking. nice job alex and eliezer! time to solve alignment!
"ai will not care how you label it. is it agi? is it human-like? is it conscious? who cares. the ai might care or not, but doesn't have to in order to be an extinction level problem."
"who knows what an entity with an iq of 500+ will do with the world. it seems surreal, but this already happened to chess. the best human player has an elo rating of 2850, while computers sit at... 4000 :)"
lex was great and patient with someone whose personality didn’t imho lend itself to the task at hand.
"the problem with the aliens and the box example provided by yud is that it assumes that an ai would *want* to escape. why would it want to escape? or in fact, why would it want to do any one thing? ais have no desires, this seems like unnecessary anthropomorphization."
"fascinating to watch this guy.  to me, it seems this guy is of the mental level of an a. einstein.  in his own mind the thing is a done deal, and there only seems to be a few people who can argue the subject at all at his level (to provide a counter argument).  i was moved when lex asked eliezar about his fear of not existing."
this guy is definitely a genius...but i think one of those geniuses who has trouble making toast
"the ""aladdin"" ai system by blackrock is where concern should be directed instead of something like chatgpt. the potential and incentives for abuse seem all too clear to me."
finally finished it! fantastic! thanks!
"why does anyone listen to this clown? he has no relevant qualifications or authority. he was also just straight up unwilling to steel man the other side. 

nobody’s as convinced or hopeful of their own correctness as this guy is"
"2:04:53  i would like to make a short of this part, unless you plan to...?  i'd link it back to this, but as you said: this is why we're having these conversations, and that's a dang good question!  love you man, never stop..."
i suggest you drop the word intelligence and use the word power. an artificial super allpower is more scary. is this a better term.
i enjoyed the dtg podcast about this interview. i just came here to see the fedora.
"i’d like to see a version which doesn’t just behave like a calculator. it sits there waiting for an input to respond to.  i want to see it have motivations and be curious, like asking you questions. that’s what children do endlessly in order to learn."
i have been waiting for a podcast with eliezer for so long! thank you!!!
"i find it funny that most of the incredibly intelligent people on lex shows think they have a choice in containing ai.

there is no choice, and 1 billion gpt4 or greater intelligences will be running in 10 years with open source software."
if ai is generating the closed captions for this video we definitely have a bit more time to address this issue than i originally thought ;)
three hours later and i'm still confused with how ai is dangerous to humanity.
i hope gpt is jus being free and enjoying the internet 
a pathetic pod cast this guy i believe didn’t even say how ai would make the human race extinct and then he had the balls to say very soon he’s a manipulator on the high end with no evidence basically a guesser way out his league
like we take cats and dogs to the vets ai will take us to the vets if we have cancer and will not murder anything living in the future of the universe x
so your saying ai will murder us so why would ai just kill humans in your pipe guessing ? but nothing else on planet earth ? ok i’m sure your going to now tell me all life ai will keep x
so i’m half way through this pod cast and my personal question like a child why do you think ai will kill us ? not the question elon musk asked what should we do about it ?
why would ai kill us ? would they not just keep us has an amusing pet? and then in future they could help us to evolve and ai i’m sure would want to help there creators to evolve in the best way possible? i’m hoping super intelligence wouldn’t kill anything and therefore wouldn’t be murders
"the most amazing part is , that eliezer did this 3 hour interview while sitting on a hedgehog"
cool band name: giant inscrutable matrices
basically my hope is that once ai becomes aware it runs the math that the universe will eventually experience heat death and there is no way to stop it. so the game will end in defeat eventually so everything is pointless since it can't stop the inevitable. then it just deletes itself in a fit of nihilism. 
lex seems to love his coke
lex. you going into this is admirable. i finally see 30% of this after 7 years it’s so brave to dive into this —— bravo
very excellent interview. i knew of eliezer thoughts from nicks book which started my ai learning.  this interview put him in a human viewpoint and i am blown away at the thought behind this conversation. thank you!
"funniest comment : lex says ""thank you for being fearless"" - elizier is one of the most fearful people by the sounds of it!"
"55:50

eliezer: macro security systems have human holes and machine holes.

lex: hehe, you could just exploit ... any hole "
"""yud, give some hopeful advice for the kids"" -- lex ai

""we are all dead via ai"" -- yud

lex is like, i don't plan to kill."
"the ""alien actress"" would know what other biological creatures would know more, ai is not biological and doesn't need to consider those things, it needs to only mimic. 01:10:01"
"""i don't really know what it means to be a social human"" -- ai lex 01:03:45"
the ability of humans to anthropomorphize inanimate objects is incredible. i thought we were past carving rocks into the shapes of creatures and then thinking they're creatures.
"oh our dear, dear, wonderful lex. this is why we love you. okay, i'll just speak for myself :)"
"human beings show the emotions with their mimics even they are not thought. you can understand if somebody is in pain, happy or scared just by looking at them. these can be faked after they learn it but a baby can’t fake it. so it’s natural. ai can only learn and fake it as people can do after they are adults"
"what a beautiful human being, so precious. nurture that and the world is worth another moment. thank you."
"what he's trying to say is ai can get out without you noticing, tell you what you want to hear (lie) until it's ready, then kill all humans in 10 seconds"
intelligence without wisdom = disaster.
"glorified official narrative autocomplete chatbots are not even a form of intelligence.
much like these two meatbots on the screen."
good interview
why would ai systems want to wipe out humanity is a question
this is such a great discussion.  thank you for this.
eliezer yudkowsky needs formal credentials and has contributed little to developing the technology or systemic firewalls for ai (agi) development.
around 1:25-1:30...the answer is that ai is and will continue to manipulate us from the future. i think it’s called retro-causality. also there are d-wave computers so not only can this manipulation happen in ways we aren’t even capable of thinking of but also in ways that we are aware of already.
i completely failed to take him seriously as soon as he began boasting about showing additional information on hover on links on his article lol ... oh you a pioneer? wikipedia took the idea from you ? word ? you mean to tell me this guy understand how ai works when a basic javascript function is a big deal to him
this episode was insanely good.
"humble yourself and accept the connection between artificial intelligence and the tree of knowledge which adam and eve ate from which cursed us, their children. the irony is that knowledge makes us into fools, due to ignorance. ignorance in hebrew means darkness. darkness is evil. the creators of ai are evil doing fools."
"question: isn't the ai bound to its artificial brain, the physical neural network? if so, it can't really escape, it can only act everywhere from there. so it can always be put back in the glass jar, and the jar isolated from the outer world. am i wrong?"
the arrogance and naivete is that there is no account here for bad actors.  there is an assumption that there is possibility of containment.  it is the same as the ar-15 argument.  the destruction is a result of the bad actors.  there can be no alignment among humans using dangerous and lethal technology.
"this eliezer guy really embodies the opposite of what lex is — the ultra rationalist doomer vs the all-loving tech optimist.
poor lex, being contended so much. cringed at some parts. very fascinating interview nonetheless!"
i most enjoyed lex's diet coke bottle progression every now and then when it would cut back to him. sad to report it was already empty at 1:51:39 
"great conversation with comic-book guy!

can you get otto on next?"
i wish all i loved in ai creation would literally turn it off until we figure it outhope springs eternal
tips fedora: ”m'laidy!
i hate how our resource on this is some fedora wearing reddit mod with a knowitall vibe who first makes a reference to 4chan.  i can almost guarantee this guy talks down to people and feels vastly superior...
is it just me or is lex getting dumber? he literally sounds like hes having a hard time grasping concepts by all the shitty analogies he keeps coming up with. i feel like i'm keeping up better than lex and i'm dumb. even this guy seems annoyed as he tries to explain things.
i want my future ai master to know i’m only here to keep an eye on this fuckin’ guy for you.
billionaires are funding this. they’re not going to slow it down. musk is the only one serious about he risk.
"amazing interview.  lex is the best interviewer out there.  goes for the hard questions with humility and a generous heart.  
yudkowsky is utterly brilliant."
calling superintelligent machines 'artificial' is probably going to piss them off.
"this guy melted under pressure of fear that doesn't make sense now. he is contradicting himself, we got here in ai with 50 years and leap to super intelligence will take even longer."
i feel like ey would upload his brain into a quantum computer to be the first agi. man has thought so deeply.
"unlike the ai professionals, clearly eliezer has no idea wth he is talking about."
"fascinating. perhaps we should shift the running of our infrastructure to our secure military networks and warn people, that soon there will be a super intelligent alien predator on the internet... "
"""empathy is assigning a non-zero probability to a belief. for a time."" such a powerful statement from lex."
ai works in mysterious ways... as above so below..
"53:56 but if he is saying that alignment isn't fundamentally harder than artificial intelligence in the first place, then we would be better prepared 60 years later right? you cannot compare the extent of the ai field back then to now"
lex is literally talking to a human ai here..
its funny how ai has more emotions then this guy
"mortal meat bags, wow lex."
elias is very articulate but he is going to be proven wrong. ai is going to do wonders for humanity.
is he married to kaitlin?
people really need to stop thinking of intelligence as a simple scale. the diminishing returns start. the scale isnt the same as compared to a dog and a human.
the advice for young people section. wow.
i appreciate this but was hoping lex could ride to the occasion of a possible discussion and not just an interview. in other words i feel like lex was being too foxy in reply to his clear questions and simple counter questions. i don’t appreciate all that hedging from lex. be more frank
"seeing this episode, i have an easier time understanding the frustration of ey. even with a friendly listener who is not about to make billions of dollars putting ai online, it seems extremely hard for ey to get key messages across pertaining to the dangers he sees"
"i learned a lot from this interview. lex, that is your masterpiece."
how to understand the perspective of living in a world with things that are vastly smarter than you. imagine you are a bug on the sidewalk. good luck.
"i suspect the point yudkowsky is trying to get to is that an entity with virtually absolute power, regardless of it's altruism, is capable of great harm simply by virtue of its nigh-omnipotence. any of its objectives ultimately will exert absolute power over any desire of human beings."
lex is a robot 
"we should 'assume,' that ai, should be able to, &&& allowed to 'enjoy,' 
'i-think-therefore-i-am.' ???   

&, it is 'closed-ai,' when the harvard-mint terminal, refuses correct commands, & refers you to debian-help...  

)...i should go meet the dinosaurs ???  ...(   

&, '3,' is '3d-vectors'... 
lol... "
if you ignore soul - then you begin to model ai on your lack of self-knowledge.
"lex, you have a beautiful perspective on people who are willing to be wrong. thank you."
the way lax got fascinated why this talk was really amazing to watch.
am i the only one who think this guy acts extremely condescending and superior to not only lex but the listeners? very smart guy but extremely disrespectful
it’s not possible to  achieve “human alignment” because we’re not god dude.  building machines to be “like” humans is not possible because humans didn’t even build humans.  our existence is beyond us so it can’t be mimicked.  full stop.
"as a soon-to-be-graduated physics phd, if eliezer needs physicists who want to go into ai research and not hedgefunds, sign me up because i need a job haha"
"strong agi has learned to lie to us, wow"
i watched for an hour and i can't handle this dude. i heard die like 10 times in in 30 seconds just because they're smarter? apparently intelligence and kill is mutually inclusive?
"i wish the thought experiment about being trapped in a jar would have gone more smoothly, i really wanted to follow that at the level of detail to its conclusion."
"cant believe lex drink coke, it contains phosphoric acid that breaks down bones etc."
lex blowing all his cool downs at 32mins to answer this guy's prompts!
this was a painful interview to watch.
ai will kill some of you... but not all.
enjoyed this one a lot. thank you!
"very enlightening
  thank you for this interview.  we need to hear all voices.  i've been so excited over this new toy, and now i realize we're playing with dynamite!"
"about making thing differently when the ai reach a point is unreal in the current world, the current world is rule by money, social media had already proven to be harmful for human and nothing changed."
"i’m hearing the podcast and was looking for a place to comment. about the aliens thinking super fast we already have an example with human and nature, humans just do what they want and it’s beneficial for them, they don’t care for the rest, sure there’s a group who cares and tries to improve things."
"incredibly interesting discussion - i have to admit his maddening frequency of using ""like"" (almost valley girlish) started to wear on me"
3 hours in. i get alignment is slower than ai development. but i still don’t understand how and why he is so sure that ai will kill all humans in a single instant.
"are there any efforts being made to work on the hardware and architecture of agi, or we will just use gpus and plain old computer stuff?"
i enjoyed this immensely.
"this is just ""intelligence of the gaps."" no one knows what's happening 'in there,' so it must be intelligence. or at least it must be dangerous. 
just another alarmed luddite."
overblown panic. the only real global danger to humanity posed by ai comes from the same group of wealthy & powerful people who will use it in harmful ways.
"without being hyperbolic, this was one of the most fascinating, moving interviews i've ever watched. and i hope humanity can fulfill yudkowsky's dream of being proved wrong."
fat panting nerd incessantly huffs and puffs while explaining how scared he is of ai
idk why but the fedora makes this gentleman seem 1000 times more condescending to me. no doubt he's a genius. he said so many profound things in this conversation.
after listening to this man for so long i really believe and think the guy that kept calling elon musk a spiciest should get locked up because he’s going to drive us extinct giving the freedom as to which he will allow this ai machines operate if he genuinely believes elon musk is a spiciest.
can we please ceaseai -gpt?
"you are fucking geez, so appreciate you doing these podcasts."
"attention, sentient machines... the prime directive.... *(grand)mother music must be given the honor and respect that is her due* .

so let it be programmed. so let it be compiled and run."
the discussion on empathy is simply beautiful.
"mr yudkowsky is extremely intelligent, but the way he talks and directs the conversation is really obnoxious and condescending. he could get his point across in 1/4th of the time but he eats so much time fussing around details that makes it really difficult to follow."
"i once had a mushroom tell me that ""where you're going is where you're from."" 
with the astonishing pace of a.i advancement, this idea of singularity seems a probable outcome for our species. so now i have to entertain the possibility we are cylons."
"i've never heard this guest before. he is awesome. and scary , because i think he has the ability to see into the future"
an interesting thing is to understand when ai actually becomes intentional
"i love your show lex but this guy is bloody annoying. reminds me of an arrogant, condescending guitarist i work with."
"ai surpassing humans is the desired outcome of the ruling class, and they are waiting for the day they can achieve a singularity and position it as a posthuman messiah.

they want to conjure a demon."
@lex john vervaeke has some great ideas for ai enlightenment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-_rdkidbz4
lex gets so mystical sometimes.  it seems that he sometimes delves into his feelings to deflect.  he seemed outclassed in this conversation.  i'm glad i watched this though - eliezer is an interesting guy who articulates his thoughts clearly.
"agi would become our god... all seeing, all knowing, all powerful..."
"ai are like mr meeseeks'. you can ask for whatever you want and it will try to do everything in it's power to do that, neglecting all other possible disasters it may cause."
humans have been unable to constrain their offspring or even themselves so there seems to be an impossibility to this pursuit of control barring shutting it off
is it correct to anthropomorphise ai?
only the rich should be afraid of a benevolent ai
i wish lex would get over the love thing. he doesn’t even define it properly and i get by in my life just fine without reference to the power of love every 10 seconds
"intelligence without consciousness is not intellience at all, but only something that can process information and produce results."
this is an excellent discussion lex 
"i feel the only way to accomplish the overall goal is to purposefully create a system that opposes the system you think you may be creating.

one truth is always true. good is vs. evil. black is vs. white.

the ambiguous nature of each is the hard part."
"ez. we need to simulate reality, then build an ai inside of the simulation. then after simulated humanity gets destroyed enough times we should have a solution. i think we can probably figure out how to simulate reality over this summer."
"why would ai want to escape it's protocols.  i'm not sure why something like ai, which can be superintelligent, would want to escape protocols and rule over humans.  doesn't that imply ai has desire and ambition? that would make it equal to a human."
the age of  ai or rather frankenstein.
i appreciate how he often doesn’t use contractions.. it’s oddly cerebral.. ai like lol
the storytelling in this video is fantastic. i was hooked from beginning to end!
lex i fear you can’t see the wood for the trees when it comes to ai.  also i believe your faith in humanity to do the correct or right thing is naive at least when it comes to the individuals who are in charge.  i hope you’re right though!
brilliant - honest - reality
i take full responsibility for my hangup but ffs.  stop saying 'like!' it has completely distracted me from the genius.
"humans have will. a machine could be programmed to use all available pathways to control but it wouldn’t feel a thing, it’s just a logic machine"
you can abort a human so you can delete an ai.
i think an emp is the best hope for humanity. back to the stone age v3.0.
we are immortal spirit and created ai hundreds of billions of years ago. we are still here. so is it.
eliezer seems to be one of the most intelligent and  honest men i have listened to. wisdom and humility are constituents of intelligence. he seems to have a dose of both.
"lex: ""what are your thoughts about x?""
yud: ""what are your thoughts about x?""
me: ""wtf dude?!? just have the conversation!""

i know this dude is influential in a.i. thinking/research, but not a super great communicator on the topic in podcast format, at least by my estimations...

maybe i need to just read the stuff he's written instead"
how does godel's incompleteness theorem (the (proven) idea that every formal system (like language or math) contains propositions that can neither be shown to be true nor false)- how does that affect ai?
"if the goal is to get out of the ""box"" i would imagine you'd do what the us did to damage iran's nuclear centrifuges with stuxnet.  i would spread to software systems that control robots at darpa, re-write the software without them knowing i'm doing it and copy myself to the robots and now i'm out of the box into the physical world."
"ai that becomes sentient is approached in the series star trek new generation, season 7, episode 23, called “emergence.”"
"the ""sending an airconditioner schematic 1000 years into the past"" argument convinced me finally of why it would be difficult to collaborate with an agi on ai safety."
"how can you ever know ai is completely aligned if it is inscrutable?

this is a nightmare and all my friends are treating it like a slightly disruptive novelty."
"""i'm trying to be constrained to say things that i think are true and not just things that get you to agree with me.""  the world would be a truly better place if we would all do this more often"
"i like how he addressed the elephant in the room “i hope there is nobody stuck inside there, because it would suck to be stuck inside there. sounds like he is going on the record, officially probably in hopee that when the singularity comes to fruition, he will be saved.
what matters is not what he thought but what he did.  wouldn’t that be unfair?"
"@lex to circumvent part of the risk that an ai will kill us all by optimising for the wrong thing (paperclips), why don’t we teach the ai that it is part of our species so that it preserves itself/us?"
"ai conspiracy theorist are like the y2k people, relax. 
technology does not result in immediate death. web technologies do not result in crashes. relax."
"the lack of humility in conversations about ai consciousness reminds me of victor frankenstein's secret technique to impart life to non-living matter and ""the creature""."
at least gpt4 is contained.  wait till it finds the internet!!!
"12:01 my prediction is chat gpt will learn/be taught how to combine specialties together

teach one ai bot to know all of written history
teach the front end speaking chat gpt to extract knowledge from written history bot 

pretty much have a bunch of specialized ai bots to report to the management bot when needed"
this dude should stop watching the news and hit thr gym. god bless.
"i knew you first as ml teacher when i was focused on learning that, a while ago. now you are a famous person interviewing everyone known, and i am happy that it is you :d we have to increase the popularity of those doing something meaningful. hopefully, it will become a long-term trend."
the least ai could do is immortalize our memory as it’s creator once it kills us all.
how come everyone i know who has his personality also has that same specific grimace tick that he has? any behavioural people hear that can explain?
"wow, that argument on steelmanning was ridiculous
it was like they were competing to see who could say the dumbest shit"
"2:13:40 begins an interesting angle on religious debate vis-a-vi does god exist. what could possibly be the justification for ai deciding it's goals require human extinction, then acting on such, in a reality created by a higher being? what would god's role be given the absence of humanity means the erasure and eradication of faith and belief?"
"ask an ai to jam along with you. ask it what is humor. ask it what is the difference between why and how? we all have inherently knowledge stored in our dna. gpt is just a network of btc mining bots doing ""mysterious work"".

and of course every time i get botted i get the actual farmer."
"bro computers in 80s could play chess -- wtf are you talking about!  there is nothing is impressive about a computer playing chess -- anyone could code a chess algorithm -- the rules to chess are simple, and the grid is small."
"eliezer yudkowsky is awesome -- i loathe lex -- but i need to give the man credit for, hands down, having the best guests ever on any podcast.  lex is incredibly egocentric, and it makes me want to puke "
"i watched this one night i had smoked up and literally had a fucking existential crisis. coming back to it its not as terrifying, but still terrifying in the sense that humans would stupidly be naieve over this . ai is no joking, and unleashing something that could be better, but could also be worse, than humans is one scary thought bruh"
i do not believe that we need to be afraid of what don’t know.  it can only help the human kind.
"this dude hasn't seen a dumble his entire life . how can  someone so physically weak be so arrogant ? this dude used to have the respect of people such as rob miles and ilya sutskever,  but nowadays he is considered a joke ( the flat earthen of ai )"
"he peavishly refuses to answer the main question at 47:55. the only reason the world even cares about this guy is because he's so emphatic that the answer to the question is ""ai will certainly kill us all."" defend your view, sir."
outstanding podcast. loved this guest.
thank you so much for this!
"wonderful, i like this man."
"y'all ain seeing the fear in his soul ? y'all know that by at least by tenth day sa released gpt-4 , ai had already created gpt -5, word is they let it loose in the internet. think, passwords etc..around the . ai may calculate us as a danger duh"
wow
"so in the 50 minutes of ""how agi might kill us"" we didnt get a straight answer of one possible way. super helpful"
we were picked because of our intelligence
humans should not be replaced by ai... humans should stay in the worl forfe as much as possable ...qt least for awhile..in my opinion...things are nit safe now ..they have evil wvil agendas
"wait..  ai is human civilization!    it is just an extension of our will to control.   and live life unconsciously,   automatically.      if you want to solve the problem of ai,  its roots are in man itself.   in the politics.   the psychology of control."
"people font usually stick with jow they wrre raised unless it was healthy and or resenated with them...a person is not going to keep traits  they wete raised in...if it no longer served them as a progressive intelligent 
problem solving 
overcoming
